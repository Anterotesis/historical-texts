            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE ſubject Matter of this Book is a free Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, according to the Light of Nature and Natural Reaſon, touching the Primitive Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Mankind, conſiſting principally of theſe Parts and Aſſertions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That according to the Light of Nature and Natural Reaſon, the <hi>Mundus aſpectabilis</hi> was not Eternal, but had a Beginning.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That if there could be any imaginable doubt thereof, yet by the neceſſary Evidence of Natural Light it doth appear that Mankind had a beginning, and that the ſucceſſive Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Men were in their Original <hi>Ex non genitis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. That this Truth is evident by Reaſon and Arguments demonſtrative, or at leaſt little leſs than apodeictical.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That there are Moral Evidences of the truth of this Aſſertion, which are herein particularly expended and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; and how far forth they are concludent, and how far not: which I have impartially delivered.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That thoſe great Philoſophers that aſſerted this Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Mankind <hi>Ex non genitis,</hi> both ancient and modern, that rendred it by <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> different from that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were miſtaken: Wherein the ſeveral <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Empedocles, Epicurus, Avicen, Cardanus, Ciſalpinus, Beregardus</hi> and others are examined, and the abſurdity and impoſſibility thereof detected.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Syſtem, as well of the Creation of Man as of the World in general, abſtractively conſidered without relation to the Divine Inſpiration of the Writer, is highly conſonant to Reaſon, and upon a bare rational account highly preferrible before the Sentiments of thoſe Philoſphers that either thought Mankind Eternal, or ſubſtituted <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of his firſt Production different from the <hi>Moſaical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb facs="tcp:64147:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>VII. I have concluded the whole with certain Corollaries and Deductions, neceſſarily flowing from the things thus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, as well touching the Exiſtence, the Wiſdom, Power, Providence of Almighty God, as touching both the Duty and Happineſs of Mankind.</p>
            <p>Though this may ſeem a laborious Work to little purpoſe, ſince the generality of Chriſtians, among whom I write, do generally believe this Truth of the Origination of the World and Mankind, as it is delivered in the Holy Scriptures; and thus to write in proof of a Truth generally received, doth rather create Doubts in Mens Minds of what they already believe, than any way advantage or confirm their belief.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, 1. That for my part I think Atheiſm ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable a thing, ſo abhorrent to the Light of Nature and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Conſcience, that I cannot think there is ſo much ſpeculative Atheiſm abroad in the World as many good Men fear and ſuſpect: But if there be but one quarter of that Atheiſm in the World, I do not know any better Cure of it, or Preſervative againſt it, next to the Grace of God, than the due Conſideration of the Origination of Mankind. 2. Again, though the Creation of Man be generally acknowledged by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yet we muſt likewiſe conſider that many take it up only as a part of their Education, and not upon any ſerious, deep Conviction of the truth of it: and had ſuch Men but an Education in ſuch a Place or Country where it is not believed, or where it is doubted, they would be at leaſt ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptical and doubtful in the belief of it. 3. The beſt of Men, and ſoundeſt believers of Divine Revelations, may be better confirmed by the acceſſion and ſuffrage even of Natural Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Verities they already believe; but howſoever, it better enables them to convince ſuch Gainſayers as will be governed in their Judgments by no other Light than the Light of Nature and Reaſon, and many ſuch there may be met withal in the World.</p>
            <p>And upon that account, my whole Diſcourſe is bottomed upon Natural and Moral Evidences ſuited to theſe Mens Principles or Motives, by which they are guided and governed; yea when I make uſe of the Sacred and Infallible Scriptures, I do uſe them abſtractively from their Divine and Infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and only as Moral Evidences of the Truth I aſſert:
<pb facs="tcp:64147:3"/>
for any Man may eaſily foreſee, that an Atheiſtical Spirit that denies or queſtions the truth of the Fact therein delivered, will not be convinced by the Infallibility of that Scripture which delivers that for a Truth, which he denies or queſtions.</p>
            <p>This whole Book as thou now ſeeſt it, was written by me ſome Years ſince, and hath lain ever ſince in my Cheſt, and ſurely therein ſhould have lain ſtill, but only for Three Reaſons: 1. Becauſe that ſome Writings of mine have without my privity come abroad in Print, which I never intended; and this might have had the ſame fate, if not in my Life time, yet after my Death. 2. Becauſe poſſibly there hath ſome more care been uſed by me in the Digeſting and Writing hereof, than of ſome others that have gone abroad in publick. 3. That although I could never be brought to value the Writings of mine that are publiſhed, as worthy of the publick view, yet I find them well accepted by many, which encouraged me to let this Book come abroad under my own Name; wherein I uſed more care than in thoſe leſſer Tractates, although I have not yet confidence enough to ſay that this may deſerve any great acceptation: though there be many things in it which may not pleaſe, yet I do think there be many things uſeful, and ſuch as will not diſpleaſe Judicious Readers.</p>
            <p>If there be any Faults or Miſtakes in Quotations, in Syntax, in Tranſlations, in Tranſcriptions, or if there by any Errours (as poſſibly there may be) in my Deductives, Inferences, or Applications; or if the Language be in ſome places either improper or obſcure, or if the Expreſſions or Words which we ſometimes uſe be not ſo full, ſo ſignificant, or proper, or delivered from Amphibologies, yet I muſt deſire the Reader to take this Apology for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was written at leiſure and broken times, and with great intervals, and many times haſtily, as my buſie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Employment of another nature (known to the World) would give me leave; which muſt needs make ſuch Breaks, and Chaſms, and Incoherences, that poſſibly a continued, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted <hi>ſeries</hi> of writing would have prevented, and carried on the Diſcourſe with a more equal Thred.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A long indiſpoſition of Health hath much hindred and interrupted me in a ſtrict reviſing and amending of what poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly might have been requiſite to be done.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:64147:4"/>3. A Man whoſe ſcope, and intent, and drift is at ſome one thing, and hath his Eye and Deſign fixed upon it, many times is not ſo ſolicitous nor ſo curious, nor ſo exact in the choice of his Words, eſpecially in Expreſſions of collateral things, not being the principal Subject of the Diſcourſe, which though they may lye in his way, yet are not much under his ſtrict advertence; but he thinks it is enough if he dreſſeth his Diſcourſe ſo that it tend to what it principally aims and drives at. And hence it is, that in Chronological Computations, which I ſometimes make uſe of, I content my ſelf with a more lax and common Computation, without any great curioſity or exactneſs, becauſe it equally ſerves my purpoſe as if my Computations were more critical and exact, even <hi>uſque ad minutias Chronologicas;</hi> and ſo in ſome other mentions of Names and Times of Authors, and the like: and likewiſe in the choice of Words or Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, wherein poſſibly I may ſometimes be too lax and free, uſing ſuch as come next into my Mind, without a curious or critical choice; which is more excuſable in a Diſcourſe of this nature, than in ſome Polemical and Controverſial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of other natures, where Men uſually catch at Words and Expreſſions, and it is the greateſt part of their Buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I muſt alſo deſire my Readers pardon, in that in my Tranſcripts of ſome entire Texts out of <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Plutarch</hi> and others, I uſe the <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation, and not the Original <hi>Greek,</hi> wherein the Authors wrote: I was a better <hi>Grecian</hi> in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, than in the 66<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of my Life; and my application to another Study and Profeſſion, rendred my skill in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of little uſe to me, and ſo I wore it out by degrees.</p>
            <p>And thus thou haſt this Book preſented to thy view, I wiſh thee as much Contentment in Reading as I had in Writing it: If there be any thing therein that may be uſeful to thee (as I ſuppoſe there may be) there is matter for my Contentment and thy Benefit; if all be not anſwerable thereunto, and to thy expectation, the former Conſiderations give thee reaſonable Motives of Charity to excuſe it.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. I.</hi> The Introduction, declaring the reaſon of the choice of this Subject, and the Method of the intended Diſcourſe.</head>
               <p>IT is an admirable evidence of the Divine Wiſdom and Providence, that there is that ſutable accommodation and adaptation of all things in Nature, both to their own convenience and exigence, and to the convenience, uſe, and exigence of one another; which evidenceth, 1. That all things are made, governed, and diſpoſed by a moſt intelligent, and wiſe, and powerful Being. 2. That that governing Being is but one, and that all this accommodation, and adapta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and mutual ſubſervience of the things in Nature are the product of one moſt wiſe decree, counſel, and purpoſe of that one moſt wiſe, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and ſoverag<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n in Being.</p>
               <p>It is not here ſeaſonable to make a large proſecution of the particular inſtances of that accommodation of things in Nature, nor of the neceſſity of the former conſequences ariſing from it. The inſtances thereof, that are ſutable to the Deſign meant in this Diſcourſe, ſhall be only theſe two, which I ſhall but ſhortly touch: 1. The admirable accommodation of Senſible Faculty to the Objects of Senſe, and of thoſe Objects to it, and of both to the well-being of the Senſible Nature: 2. The admirable accommodation of the Intellectual Faculty in Man to Intellectual Objects, and of thoſe Objects to it, and of both to the well-being of the Humane or Rational Nature.</p>
               <p>Touching the former, the Senſible Nature in its complement and integrity hath five exterior powers or faculties, that are accommodated to all thoſe motions or impreſſions of natural bodies, and their accidents which are uſeful to it; and by theſe five ports or gates all thoſe impreſſions which are uſeful for the perception of the Senſible Nature are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to it, namely, the five exterior Senſes. It is not only poſſible, but very likely, that there may be ſuch motions or qualities of Bodies, that make not any impreſſion upon any of thoſe Senſes; but if there be ſuch, they are ſuch as are not of uſe for the perception or convenience of the Senſible Nature. But for ſuch as are neceſſary for ſuch perception of the Senſible Nature, there is no motion, quality, or operation of external Bodies, but what hath accommodated to it a Faculty in Senſe receptive of it: Is there ſuch a motion or objectiveneſs of external Bodies which produceth light or colour, figure, vicinity, or diſtance, the Faculty of Sight is fitted to receive that impreſſion or objectiveneſs, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64147:7"/>
that objectiveneſs fitted and accommodate to that Faculty. Is there that motion or objectiveneſs that cauſeth ſounds? the Faculty of Hearing is fitted to be receptive of it, and that objectiveneſs or motion (or what ever it is) fitted to make an impreſſion upon that Faculty. And ſo for the other Senſes. And by this adaptation and congruity of theſe Faculties to their ſeveral proper Objects, and by the fitneſs and proportionateneſs of theſe objective Impreſſions, Qualities, or Motions, upon their reſpective Faculties, accommodated to their reception, the Senſible Nature hath ſo much of perception and reception of things as is neceſſary for its ſenſible Being. I ſpeak not here of thoſe other interior Senſes of Diſcrimination of the Objects of Senſe, Phantaſie, Memory, Appetite, and the reſt, for they are not at preſent to my purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And what is thus excellent and admirable in the accommodation between the ſenſitive Faculties and their Objects, is to be obſerved in the intellectual Faculty, though the Faculty and Object are far more noble and excellent than that of Senſe. As there is an accommodation between the viſive Faculty and its Object, and as there is an accommodation between the Faculty of the Taſte and the Object, the Object fitted to make an impreſſion upon the Faculty, and Faculty fitted to take the impreſſion from the Object; ſo there is an accommodation, and ſutable adaptation, between the intellective Faculty and the intelligible Object, the Object as it were thruſting it ſelf into the Faculty, and the Faculty receiving and perceiving the Object.</p>
               <p>The means of derivation, and immediate union of theſe intelligible Objects to the Underſtanding, are various: Sometimes divine and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, as by immediate irradiation or revelation; ſometimes artificial and inſtituted, as by diſcourſe and inſtituted ſigns, and thus Intelligibles are conveyed from one man to another by words or writing; ſometimes natural, and that ſeems to be by three kinds of means, 1. by the mediation of Senſe, which is ordinarily the firſt baſis of all humane intellectual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; 2. by ratiocination or diſcourſe of the Mind, whereby even from ſenſible Objects the Intellect receives a farther proſpect of other Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibles, not immediately preſented by or to the Senſe, but by conſequences, deductions, and concluſions deduced from things more obvious to Senſe, and perchance at firſt repreſented by it; 3. there ſeems to be a third means, which is a kind of intuition; there are ſome truths ſo plain and evident, and open, that need not any proceſs of ratiocination to evidence or evince them; they ſeem to be objected to the Intellective Nature when it is grown perfect and fit for intellectual operation, as the Objects of Light or Colour are objected to the Eye when it is open, they are underſtood and aſſented unto <hi>quaſi per ſaltum &amp; intuitum;</hi> and though theſe truths are ſuch as are alſo deducible by ratiocination and rational proceſs, yet the connexion between the premiſſes, and the concluſion in them, are ſo clear, and the tranſition from the premiſſes to the concluſion is ſo ſwift, ſhort, and clear, that it ſeems to be in a moment, and the aſſent to them and evidence of them is inſtantaneous; ſuch are many concluſions of moral and intellectual truths, which ſeem upon this accompt to be congenite with us, connatural to us, and engraven in the very frame and compages of the Soul, becauſe they are Intelligibles of that nature that preſent themſelves, and thruſt themſelves into the Underſtanding
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64147:7"/>
immediately, and many times without the mediation of Senſe or Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination. There is that primitive congruity between theſe Intelligibles and the Intellectual Faculty, that they are immediately united as I ſaid by a kind of intuition, and though they are deducible by ratiocination, as concluſions from premiſſes, yet in reſpect of their ſwift <hi>tranſitus</hi> in the Underſtanding they ſeem to be principles.</p>
               <p>Now this excellent Faculty of the Underſtanding, though it ſeems to be paſſive in relation to its reception of its Object, yet it is not barely a paſſive Faculty, it hath an activity about that Object that it receives, and it actively trades upon it to its farther improvement.</p>
               <p>And therefore according to the nature of this excellent Faculty the Underſtanding (which as it hath been ſaid is partly active and partly paſſive) there are two things that do much improve and enrich this Faculty.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is improved by its Exerciſe and Employment, the very Faculty it ſelf will degenerate, and grow ſluggiſh, dull, and ruſty by idleneſs: The exerciſe of the Intellective Faculty makes it agil, quick, and lively, yea though the object about which it is exerciſed be poor, little, and low, yet a Man hath this advantage by the exerciſe of this Faculty about it, that it keeps it from ruſt and torpidneſs, it enlargeth and habituates it for a due improvement even about nobler Objects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is enriched by the nobleneſs and worth of the Object about which it is exerciſed, when the Object is noble, generous, uſeful, and ſutable, at leaſt in a convenient degree to the worth of the Faculty: Diligence and Induſtry, and exerciſe of the Intellective Faculty therein, doth not only exerciſe, imploy, habituate, and enlarge the Faculty, but enrich and enable it by the worth of the Object wherewith it is furniſhed.</p>
               <p>There is ſo great variety of Intelligibles in the World, ſo much objected to our Senſes, ſo much deducible from them by Ratiocination and Diſcourſe, and every ſeveral Object ſo full of ſubdivided multiplicity and complicateneſs: And on the other ſide, the life of Man ſo ſhort, and the approaches of the Underſtanding to the knowledge of things, is for the moſt part ſo ſlow, and gradual, and difficult, that it is not to be hoped that a Man ſhould ever attain the full comprehenſion even of any ſmall inconſiderable Inſect, with all its connexions, dependences, relations, deductions, and conſequents; much leſs can it be expected, that any Man ſhould ever attain the full knowledge of that ſtupendious multiplicity and variety, that appears in all or any conſiderable part of thoſe Objects of our Senſes that occur in that <hi>mundus aſpectabilis</hi> which every day we behold: And yet even the World we ſee is the ſmalleſt part of that which we neither do nor can ſee.</p>
               <p>Therefore it ſeems to be worth the care of a Man, that hath a deſire to improve thoſe two great Talents that God hath lent us, namely, his Time and his Faculties; that he not only exerciſe his Faculty to keep him from ſloth and idleneſs, but out of this great multiplicity of Objects to chuſe ſome ſuch for the exerciſe of his Faculties, that by their worth and value may improve and advance them; and ſuch as may be profitable for this uſe and exerciſe, and in ſome meaſure attainable with competent certainty and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>There be certain qualifications that do much commend an Object to a Man's Enquiry, which are principally theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64147:8"/>Firſt, the nobleneſs and worth of an Object: Secondly, the uſefulneſs of this Object being known, or of the knowledge of it: Thirdly, ſufficient certainty touching the Object, or of the knowledge of it: Fourthly, that the Object be ſuch as may be large enough to ſatisfie the Intellective Faculty, and yet not diſtract it through its multiplicity, vaſtneſs, or extent. Something I ſhall ſay of each of theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt qualification in the choice of an Object is, that it be noble and worthy of the Faculty that is employed about it. There is not only a congruity herein between the nobleneſs of the Faculty and the Object, but alſo the Faculty is enriched and advanced by the worth of the Object. It was the reproach of <hi>Domitian</hi> a great Emperour, that he buſied himſelf in hunting of Flies: Yet I do not blame the purſuit of the Works of Nature, even in the Contemplation of the ſmalleſt Works thereof; for though the things themſelves are comparatively low, and inconſiderable, yet even in the ſmalleſt Vegetable or Animal, even in the very little Inſects, there appears the excellent Work of the Divine Wiſdom, and therefore there is a worth and excellency in the Contemplation of them, eſpecially when that Contemplation is directed to the ſearch and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the great Wiſdom and Skill of the great Creator, who in many ſmall Inſects, that in reſpect of their minuteneſs almoſt eſcape the Sight, hath placed and digeſted as great a variety and excellency of Organs, Faculties, and Inſtincts, as in the Whale or Elephant: And therefore the Labours herein of <hi>Ariſtotle, Fortunius Licetus, Muffetus, Aldrovandus, Goddart,</hi> and others, that have written whole Volumes concerning the generation, production, alteration, and variety, even of ſmall Inſects: Flies and Worms are not without their worth and uſe, ſeeing in the leaſt of theſe the curious Wiſdom, Skill, and Power of the great Maker of all things is conſpicuous; and though they are but little Rills, yet if they be cloſely followed, they are and may be Manuductions to lead us to that Ocean of Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs of the God of Nature, from which they had their original.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond qualification that commends an Object, or Subject of Enquiry, is the uſefulneſs of its knowledge. It is true, that there is ſcarce any kind of knowledge of any Object but is grateful and uſeful in ſome meaſure to the Underſtanding: But among the <hi>Scibilia</hi> or <hi>Intelligibilia</hi> in the World, there are ſeveral degrees, ſome are not only uſeleſs to be known, but ſeem to be meer impertinencies; as for inſtance, many Grammatical Criticiſms, and how this Word was written by one Author, how by another, what faſhion Cloaths the <hi>Roman</hi> Officers, Military, Civil or Sacred uſed, and very many Curioſities relating to Languages: It is true, ſo far forth as Words and Languages are means to derive unto us the memory, relation, or underſtanding of the things contained under them, ſo far the knowledge of them is uſeful in order to that end, but Languages ſimply in relation to themſelves are but a narrow piece of ſpeculation, and conſequently thoſe great expences of time and ſtudy that ſome have taken about little uſeleſs Criticiſms, and trifles of that nature, hath been an improvident expence, and miſemployment of their time and faculties. Again, ſome things there are which are yet of more value, but yet but of little uſe, they are known only that they may be known, or inquired into only for the exerciſe of Wit, Invention and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64147:8"/>
Subtilty: What great pains hath been taken concerning the Quadrature of a Circle, and the Duplication of a Cube, and ſome other Mathematical Problems? And many Men have ſpent much time, and written great Volumes touching thoſe matters, which yet were they attained, the knowledge reſts in it ſelf, and is never applicable to any uſe anſwerable to the pains of their acqueſt. Again, there be many things touching Matters Phyſical, which though they are full of contentation to be known, and have their uſe thus far, that they are an inquiry and diſcovery of things that are the Works of God, and of his Wiſdom, and ſerve to explain many <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Nature, yet they are otherwiſe of little uſe to Mankind; as concerning the degrees of acceleration of Motion, the gravitation of the Air, the exiſtence or non-exiſtence of empty ſpaces, either coacervate or interſperſed, and many the like, which have taken up the thoughts and times, and exerciſed the Wits, and even the Paſſions of Men in Diſputes concerning them; and yet though the knowledge of them is curious, and contenting in it ſelf, yet it is not much ordinable or applicable to the uſe and benefit of the Man that knows them, or of others: And therefore though the knowledge of theſe Objects be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable unto us upon an account of their contentation and curioſity, yet they do not commend their knowledge to us upon the account of their uſefulneſs and beneficialneſs.</p>
               <p>Again, ſome Objects there are that are not only noble in themſelves, but they have alſo at leaſt a mediate and preparatory uſefulneſs to Mankind, though perchance in themſelves and immediately they have not that commodation. Thus the knowledge of divers parts in Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and the rules, motions, and variety of Qualities and Operations of divers Natural Objects, the connexion of Cauſes and Effects, the obſervation of the Order of things in Nature, are of ſingular uſe to carry the Mind up to the acknowledging and admiration of the Great Efficient and Governour of the World, of His Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, Bounty, and conſequently to raiſe up the Heart to veneration of Him, dutifulneſs and gratitude unto Him, dependance upon Him, and a deep impreſſion of Natural Religion towards Him, and of all thoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents that ariſe in the Mind and Life from this habit of Religion: So true is the Saying of an excellent Naturaliſt of our own, <hi>A little knowledge in Philoſophy may perchance make a proud empty Man an Atheiſt, but it is impoſſible that Atheiſm can lodge in a Mind well ſtudied and acquainted with Natural Philoſophy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as thus the knowledge of Nature is uſeful to Mankind, to bring him to and confirm him in the knowledge of the Glorious God, ſo it is preparatively uſeful, and indeed neceſſary to many uſeful things in this Life, as to make a Man a good Phyſician, <hi>ubi deſinit Philoſophus ibi incipit Medicus,</hi> where the Philoſopher ends the Phyſician begins; which next to the knowledge of Almighty God is of great neceſſity and uſe to Mankind.</p>
               <p>And touching Geometry, Aſtronomy, and Arithmetick, though in the knowledge of them there be many things that are nice and curious, and not ſo much in order to uſe as to ſpeculation and exerciſe of Wit, yet they are ſuch Objects, the knowledge whereof is in many things very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent to Mankind, as we ſee in the conſtruction of all Mechanical Engins
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64147:9"/>
in the meaſuring of Bodies, Superficies, and Diſtances, in the Rules and Exerciſe of Architecture, Fortifications, and ordering of Battalia's, Computations and Reckonings in Contracts and Merchants Affairs, in Navigation, in the Meaſure and Computation of Time, and the right knowledge of ſeveral Seaſons, theſe Mathematical Subjects and Sciences have great uſe in relation to humane affairs and concerns.</p>
               <p>And as thus thoſe more curious Sciences have their uſe in the Affairs of Mankind, and are commended unto us, not only upon the account of the nobleneſs, but alſo of the uſefulneſs thereof; ſo the knowledge of Hiſtory, of Humane Laws, of Moral Philoſophy, and of Political and Oeconomical regiments of the various Modes, Temperaments, and Qualifications of Governments, with their Appendages, are upon the account of their uſefulneſs to Humane Society, and the Peace, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, and Order of the World, and of the particular Societies, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Perſons therein commended to our knowledge and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, as things without which the World of Mankind would ſoon be in diſorder and confuſion. And although theſe Studies are not ſo pleaſing and grateful to the Underſtanding, as thoſe other more curious Contemplations either Phyſical or Mathematical, yet they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it with the excellency and neceſſity of their uſe, in relation to the nobleſt viſible Creature, Man, and in relation to his nobleſt and moſt uſeful poſture and ſtation in this World, namely, a ſtate of regulated Society and Government.</p>
               <p>Now according to the kind or degree of the uſefulneſs of the Objects to be known, ſo the knowledge thereof is more or leſs commended unto us, upon the account of the various degrees of uſefulneſs: Some Objects and their knowledge are of greateſt value, becauſe their uſe is of more univerſal concern and important neceſſity, and ſuch is the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Almighty God, His Greatneſs, Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Will, eſpecially as He hath revealed Himſelf in His Word, and thoſe noble habits that upon that account are ingenerated in the Soul, as Religion, Gratitude, Obedience, and Tranquillity of Mind, Regularity of the Soul and Life.</p>
               <p>And upon the ſame account there is a great value in knowledge of Morals, and of thoſe Duties that we owe to our ſelves and others, and a conformity of Minds and Lives to the Dictates of Religion and Morality. And the excellence of their uſe, and conſequently the commendation of that knowledge upon that account is evident in theſe particulars: 1. The right and true knowledge of thoſe things do not only perfect our Souls and Natures by the excellency of the knowledge it ſelf, but they perfect our Souls and Natures with Goodneſs: They do not only perfect the Intellectual Faculty, but they alſo perfect the Volitive Faculty; they make the Man not only more knowing, but more wiſe, and they alſo make him the better, more juſt, ſober, temperate, religious: A Man may know very much in Mathematicks and Natural Philoſophy, and yet be a bad Man; but a Man truly acquainted with the knowledge of God, and with the due ſenſe of his Duty to Him in matter of Religion, and his Duty to others in points of Morality, which is a part alſo of the Divine Will, is not only a knowing Man, but becomes alſo a good Man (if indeed his knowledge be ſound and true).</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64147:9"/>Again, 2. All other knowledge meerly or principally ſerves the concerns of this Life, and is fitted to the meridian thereof: They are ſuch as for ought we know will be of little uſe to a ſeparate Soul, at leaſt we do not know whether the Soul in its ſtate of ſeparation will be much concerned in the knowledge of Phyſical or Mathematical Learning, or the Rules or Methods of Political Regiment: But this we are or may be ſure, that the Soul will carry with it into the other World that knowledge of God which it acquires here, and receive an unſpeakable improvement thereof by a nearer union to Him; and it will carry with it thoſe improvements and advances of Piety, Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, thoſe Habits and Graces that it began here; and as the Soul is improved and made the better in this Life by this knowledge, and thoſe effects and meliorations that it here acquired by them, ſo it will carry along with it thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to the next World; for there is a connaturality and congruity between that knowledge and thoſe habits, and that future eſtate of the Soul. So that this kind of knowledge is not only ſerviceable and uſeful for the preſent Life <hi>in via,</hi> but is proportioned to that ſtate that is <hi>in patria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as touching the knowledge of things that are meerly accommodate to the preſent Life, they receive their diſparity of value in this reſpect, according to the diſparity or different degrees of uſefulneſs. Some are uſeful for nobler ends, ſome for lower and more inferior ends; ſome are in a greater degree uſeful for the ſame ends than others; and according to the varieties of ends, uſes, and their degrees, the knowledge of them (as in reference to this part of the commendation of an Object, namely, uſefulneſs) is more or leſs eligible. But this is too large a Subject particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to proſecute in this place.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third commendation of a Subject of Contemplation, and that renders it eligible, is Certainty. Where the Subject is uncertain, and the evidences touching it doubtful, although perchance the ſpeculation that it affords be very high and ſublime, yet ſuch a Subject is not in this reſpect ſo eligible as what is more certain, for it leaves an impartial and ſerious Mind full of doubt and diſſatisfaction; and where it meets with a Man of a buſie phantaſie, ſelf-conceited, and partial to himſelf and his own thoughts, and that would be thought to know beyond the common ſtandard of other Mens Reaſon, it puts him upon the confident framing of Hypotheſes built meerly upon Imagination, and from theſe weak foundations he deduceth Syſtems of Conſequences and Concluſions, which being built upon meer fanciful and inevident Suppoſitions, fall to nothing but duſt and ſmoke as ſoon as their evidence is impartially examined. Some Subjects are ſo remote from us that we are ſtrangers to them, and our knowledge concerning them is meerly conjectural, and thoſe very conjectures for the moſt part wanting competent <hi>media</hi> to make them tolerably probable. Concerning the Extent of the Univerſe, the Plurality of Worlds, the State of Heavenly Bodies, whether they are inhabited, and with what kind of Inhabitants, whether they are animate Bodies, whether they are moved by Intelligences, or by their own Forms, or by the motion of the Body of the <hi>Aether,</hi> or thoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary <hi>Vortices</hi> wherein they are placed? Theſe and many ſuch Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations touching things at this diſtance may gratifie the Imagination, but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64147:10"/>
never ſatisfie the Mind. Again, ſome things though they are or may be near unto us, yet are of that ſubtilty that they eſcape our Senſes, and thereby we cannot make our approaches to their diſcovery. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature of Spirits, their <hi>ubi, motus,</hi> the manner of their Intellection and mutual communication of Notions; by what means or in what manner actual Intellection is effected in the Soul; how the Species, Order, and Circumſtances of things are preſerved in the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Faculty or Organ, or where elſe? theſe and many other hidden parts of Nature, even of a far lower form, are unacceſſible to us.</p>
               <p>The Contemplation of the Univerſe, and of the Natural Cauſes and Effects therein, is indeed an excellent Contemplation: For, firſt, it exerciſeth the Intellectual Faculties, keeps them in motion and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thereby perfecteth them. Secondly, It is full of delight and contentation to the Mind. Thirdly, Although the Underſtanding attains not a perfect diſcovery of what it ſearcheth after, yet many times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigned and unthought of diſcoveries of many excellent things recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penceth the loſs of the principal intention; as thoſe that have bent their endeavour to attain the Philoſophers Stone, though they never attain their end, yet in their proceſs towards it do many times light upon excellent diſcoveries which they never thought of or deſigned, which in a great meaſure recompenſeth their diſappointment in the Particular ſought after. Fourthly, It gives a great diſcovery of the admirable Wiſdom and Power of God in framing and ordering of the World, and ſo becomes a manuduction to the knowledge, acknowledgement, and adoration of Him.</p>
               <p>But yet when we conſider how ſhort and weak our beſt diſcoveries are in the moſt acceſſible, obvious particulars, and narroweſt Integrals of the Univerſe: When we conſider how many things in Nature eſcape our Senſes, and the diſcoveries thereof; and yet how much we ſtand in need of the diſcoveries of Senſe, and ſenſible and experimental obſervation, to bottom any ſound conjecture concerning the Nature, Cauſes, and Effects of the things in Nature, and how uncertain, fanciful, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary our Suppoſitions are without it, whereby it comes to paſs, that we many times frame ſuppoſitions and concluſions concerning things ſuppoſed to be in Nature, before we have any certain evidence, whether in truth the very things about which we frame our ſuppoſitions or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions have at all any real exiſtence; or if they have, yet for want of a clear, and ſenſible, and experimented obſervation of them, our poſitions and concluſions touching their Cauſes, Effects, Order and Methods of their procedure are but fictions and imaginations, accommodated to our Inventions rather than to the things themſelves, and ſuch as we rather project we would have them be, if we had the making of them, than what in truth they are. And laſtly, if we conſider the vaſt extent and multiplicity of the whole Compaſs of the Univerſe, and the things therein contained, the many parts thereof, that either in reſpect of their tenuity or diſtance eſcape the reach of our Senſes, the infinite complications and combinations of ſeveral concurrences, cauſes, and contributions to the conſtitution and operation of almoſt every Integral in Nature; the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Lives, and the many neceſſary diverſions that we have, and muſt neceſſarily have from thoſe Contemplations. I ſay, when we conſider
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64147:10"/>
theſe things, it ſeems a thing utterly to be deſpaired of to attain a full, certain, evident knowledge of the whole Univerſe, or of any conſiderable portion thereof.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that if we conſider the various <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern Philoſophers, touching the general Syſteme of the World, and thoſe more Univerſal and Cardinal Solutions of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and great Appearances in Nature, we ſhall find them or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of them, to be little elſe than excogitated and invented Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, not ſo much ariſing from the true Image of the things themſelves, or reſulting from the real Exiſtence of them, as certain inſtituted and artificial Contrivances of mens Wits and Fancies. And theſe Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions being thus invented, they diſtort, ſtretch and reduce the Orders of things in a conformation to thoſe pre-conceived Suppoſitions; and then by the Inventers of them, and thoſe that are their followers, and would ſeem to be men of quicker ſight than others, and not to come too ſhort of the perceptions of their Leaders, they are in a little time magnified into the true Solutions of the <hi>Arcana Naturae,</hi> and then all or moſt of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentations, Poſitions, Superſtructions and Concluſions, are founded upon, and conformed unto, and deduced from theſe excogitated <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes,</hi> as if they were the true, and only and real frame and conſtitution of things, when they have as little reality, and leſs evidence than the imaginary ſolid Spheres in the Heavens, or their Muſick, the Horſes of the Sun, or any other Poetical Fictions.</p>
               <p>And if at any time ſome one <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of Nature appears, that croſſeth any of theſe Suppoſitions or <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> or ſuits not with them, or is not ſalved by them, preſently great pains is taken to ſupply that Defect with ſome ſubſidiary Suppoſition, that may ſtop that Leak, and piece up the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> which muſt be preſently granted to be true, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is any evidence of it from the things themſelves, but becauſe it ſuits with that artificial and precarious <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> which was before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up and made much of.</p>
               <p>This we may eaſily obſerve to be true; if we ſhould examine all the various Suppoſitions of leading men in their ſeveral Sects.</p>
               <p>The Chymical Philoſophers make their <hi>Tria prima, Salt, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> the great conſtituent Principles of all Bodies; others add two more: And their evidence that they are ſo, are, becauſe they find by their ſolutions by Fire, ſome things which they call by theſe Names, to be that whereinto Bodies are diſſolved; when, for ought can be evidently made out, many of theſe are not ſo much really in the conſtitution of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies themſelves, as the very alterations or changes of them by the force and energy of that active Element, or at leaſt, though after their ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they aſſume the ſhapes of <hi>Salt, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> yet there are even in thoſe Conſiſtences very various Contextures, differing extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in each Body from other, though they ſeem to aſſume ſome analogy of ſhape: And poſſibly there may be a thouſand Conſtituents of different Natures from any of theſe ſuppoſed Principles in Bodies, both before and after their ſolution by Fire or Heat.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> have excogitated another ſort of Suppoſitions of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Matter, Form</hi> and <hi>Privation.</hi> And yet it is very difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that any ſuch thing ſhould be as <hi>Matter,</hi> undetermined by ſomething
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64147:11"/>
called <hi>Form;</hi> and as difficult to conceive what many ſorts of theſe Forms are (which they call ſubſtantial) whence they ariſe, what becomes of them, whether ſome of thoſe they call Subſtantial, are any other than the various Modifications of <hi>Matter;</hi> whether others of them are not ſome middle Nature, neither Bodies nor Accidents, but Powers of a different nature from Bodies, Accidents, or Qualities, or Subſtances, though not ſo obvious to our perception: This <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> therefore ſeems for the moſt part, to be a kind of artificial contrivance, not wholly taken from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of things, but fitted to give ſome kind of explication of them; and for the moſt part an Engine to guide our Conceptions, as the Figures in <hi>Logick,</hi> or the artificial Schemes for the finding out a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> uſed by them; <hi>Barbara, Celarent, Darii,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Napcas, Cipinis vel Nipis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if we look upon the Suppoſition of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and his Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Lucretius,</hi> and his Advancer, <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> how many things muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted, that are not only perfectly inevident to our ſenſe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together improbable? The multitude of phyſically indiviſible Atoms, their ſtrange Figures acommodated to their Motion, Adheſion, and Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, their declined Motions, and the means of their Coalition: And when all this will not ſerve to contain things within any poſſible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſpecifical determination, to patch up that defect, certain <hi>Moleculae Seminales</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to make up that Defect, and to keep the World and its Integrals from an Infinitude and Exten<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leſneſs of excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions every moment into new Figures and Animals, and yet made up meerly by chance, and by the contexture of thoſe Atoms which have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quality nor energy, nor any thing elſe beſides their ſmall and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible Moles, to make them operative, and that Local Motion which they there have; but they teach us not from whence they have it.</p>
               <p>Again, If we look upon <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Suppoſition, who was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether content with the former, but gave it ſome Correctives, though the main <hi>Subſtratum</hi> be of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> what colour of evidence have we of the various Configurations of his Atomes, the grinding of them round by their mutual attritions, the coalition of the Globular Atomes into the Heavenly Bodies, the filling of Chinks and Interſtices by the <hi>Ramenta</hi> of the greater, whereby a <hi>Materia Subtilis</hi> is diffuſed through the Univerſe, which is inviſible, performs moſt of thoſe motions that we ſee in things, that the Animals are only Engins, and actuated by the mobility of this ſubtil matter? Theſe, and infinite more artificial Inventions of his there are, that neither Senſe nor Reaſon could ever acquaint him or us with; but they are an ingenious Creature of his own fruitful Invention, wittily framed to explicate not ſo much the Nature of things, but thoſe Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he entertained thereof, and to reduce and range them into an Order contrived by him, not by Nature.</p>
               <p>This Excurſion I have uſed to ſhew how great a difficulty there is for a man to have a ſuitable conception of the great Fabrick of the World with any tolerable certainty, whereby it hath come to paſs that the readieſt and moſt exerciſed Wits have fallen into ſo great varieties of explication thereof, and yet all of them ſo full of unevidence and incertainty, ſo full of precarious and imaginary <hi>Poſtulata,</hi> ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64147:11"/>
full of unreaſonableneſs, and improbability, and impoſſibilities in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and one with another, that a man that is not impoſed upon by the Veneration of the Authors, or his own Phantaſie, cannot tell how to fix in any of them but muſt cry out upon them with the Comedian, <hi>Probè fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſtis, incertior ſum nunc quàm dudum:</hi> Ye have mended the matter well; I am now more in doubt than before: Neither are we ever likely to attain any certain or ſatisfactory knowledge in the Phyſical Cauſes, Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Appearances in their largeſt extent and latitude.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth commendation of an Object of Knowledge is, that if it be meerly Phyſical or Mathematical, it bears ſome proportion to the Intellective power, neither too narrow, and circumſcribed into a ſmall compaſs, nor yet too full of multiplicity: The former ſatisfies not the Underſtanding; for it ſoon exhauſts all that is in it, and leaves the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding no work to exerciſe it ſelf withal. The latter ſurchargeth and oppreſſeth the Underſtanding with its multiplicity. And upon this latter account it is, that, although the whole Univerſe and every part thereof are Objects full of excellency and worth, yet the multiplicity thereof is ſo great and various, that the Underſtanding falls under a kind of deſpondency of getting through ſo great a Task: and thoſe that have undertaken the full ſpeculation of all the parts of the viſible World, have done it but ſuperficially, lightly, and in Generals; the time of Life and the Intellective faculty, that moves but gradually and ſucceſſively, have not been ſufficient for an exact account of all things viſible: And therefore they that have deſigned exactneſs and deep ſcrutiny into things, have taken ſome one part of Nature for that purpoſe; and even in thoſe ſingle Objects there is moſt commonly a connexion of ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Appendances or Incidents that they that have ſet themſelves upon ſuch ſeemingly narrow Enquiries, have found it a buſineſs enough to take up a greater portion of Time and Enquiry than our ſhort Lives will afford us; as may eaſily appear by the great and large Tractates of them that have written concerning the little Organ of the Eye, or the Viſive Faculty, the Magnetick Motions and Variations, or ſome other ſingle Organ or Faculty of the Reaſonable or Senſitive Nature.</p>
               <p>Among the many Objects of Knowledge, there ſeem to be two eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, which upon the moſt part of the before-mentioned accounts, moſt commend themſelves to our contemplation and enquiry; namely, the knowledge of the ever-glorious God, and the knowledge of our ſelves and the Humane Nature. Almighty God is the higheſt and moſt excellent and ſoveraign Object of the Intellectual Faculty: It is true, he falls not under the laſt qualification. Though he is but one, and one moſt ſimple uncompounded Being, yet his Nature and Perfections, his Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and all other Excellencies are infinite and incomprehenſible by any intellectual Nature but himſelf; and therefore he is an Object infinitely too large for the comprehenſion of any created Underſtanding: He is a Light too bright for our Intellective eye to ſee, but by reflexion, or through the Vail of his Word or Works. The more we know of him, and the more we draw near unto him by ſerious and humble contemplation, the more we diſcover an endleſs and unſearchable Ocean and Perfection in him, ſo that we muſt not, cannot expect to find out the Almighty to perfection; his ways are unſearchable and paſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64147:12"/>
finding out, and much more his Eſſence and Perfections; ſo that though he be the moſt natural, and the moſt deſirable Object of created Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, he is an Object infinitely too large for it.</p>
               <p>But although in reſpect of the meaſure of his Perfection, he be an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unproportionate to a created Underſtanding, a Light too bright, and an Ocean too large and too deep for it, yet there is ſo much of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge attainable by us, as is ſufficient for uſe, nature and everlaſting happineſs: and the knowlede of Almighty God, ſo far as it is attainable by our narrow created Underſtanding, highly advanceth the humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding upon all accounts, and infinitely excels the knowledge of any other Object in the world, upon theſe enſuing accounts among many others.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a knowledge of ſuch an Object that hath the greateſt and moſt convincing certainty in the world, a certainty that he is, and in a good meaſure a certainty what he is; for though it be impoſſible for any or all the created Beings in the world, to attain a diſtinct, perfect and full <hi>Idaea</hi> of the Divine excellencies, in their full, adequate, diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; yet that Image that he hath given of himſelf, in the admirable Frame of ſo much of the world which we know, doth with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble certainty evince, That he is, that he is but one, one moſt intelligent, wiſe, powerful, free, good, ſimple, eternal, infinite and moſt perfect Being, the Fountain of Being, and the firſt Cauſe of all things, though we cannot attain the full comprehenſion of that perfection: And truly it is no ſmall evidence of the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs, That that great and important Truth of the being and perfection of Almighty God (the Principle and Object of the greateſt importance in the world to the good of Mankind, and for the advance and perfecting of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) ſhould be written in ſuch plain, clear and evident Characters in the Works of Nature, and evinced by Evidences riſing from thence, as are obvious to any perſon that hath but the common uſe of Reaſon, and the honeſty to uſe and exerciſe it ſincerely.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the moſt noble and excellent Object in the world, and that may and doth moſt enoble and advance the intellective Faculty; he is the Fountain of all Being, and of all Perfection: Thoſe Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that are in the nobleſt created Natures in the world, are but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of that perfection that is in him: Though a created Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can never take in the fulneſs of the Divine Excellencies, yet ſo much as it can or doth receive thereof, is of greater extent, uſe and value, and doth more advance and enrich the Faculty, than any other Object in the world, though that other Object were fully and adequately known.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Although the Underſtanding can never ſearch out the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to perfection, by reaſon of the infinite exceſs of this Object, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the capacity of a created Faculty, yet there is that congruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Faculty and this Object, that connatural ordination, as it were, of Intellective Faculty to this Object, as if it were (if not only, yet principally) lodged in the humane Nature for the ſake of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſo that though there is no commenſurableneſs between this Object and a created Underſtanding, yet there is a congruity and connatura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity between them: And hence it is, that ſo much as we do or can know of God, is delightful and grateful to the Underſtanding. And
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64147:12"/>
though this abyſs of excellency be infinite, yet it doth not confound, nor diſorder, nor overwhelm the Underſtanding in its modeſt and due ſearches into it: And beſides, although the perfection of his Eſſence, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Attributes, as Infinitude, Immenſity, Indiviſibility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do dazle our Underſtandings, yet ſome of his Attributes, and the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, are not only highly delectable to the Intellective Faculty, but are ſutable and eaſily conceptible by us, becauſe apparent in his Works, as his Goodneſs, Beneficence, Wiſdom, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if we attend to it.</p>
               <p>And certainly it was the great Goodneſs and Condeſcention of the Glorious God unto his Creature Man, that when he knew all his own Excellencies were too great and too bright for us to ſee, he hath Been pleaſed to diſcover ſo much of himſelf as was fit and neceſſary for us to know, by means that our Faculties might uſe without diſſipation, diſtraction, or too great aſtoniſhment; namely, firſt, By his Works, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting his Greatneſs and Goodneſs. Secondly, By his Word, by Divine Revelation diſcovering his Goodneſs, Mercy, Power and Truth. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, By his Son, through the Vail of our Fleſh; by all which that Brightneſs and Splendor of the Divine Excellence, that by an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate intuition or exhibition would-have overwhelmed our Intellective Faculty (as it ſtands united to our Bodies) is preſented to us more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionately to our Capacities and Faculties, by a kind of refraction, and a more eaſie and familiar manifeſtation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is the moſt uſeful Object of our Knowledge that can be; and in compariſon of this, all other Knowledge is vain, light and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; and indeed all other knowledge is valuable upon this ſingle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, by how much it gives us a manifeſtation of the Divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and leads and conducts to the knowledge of Almighty God and his Attributes. If I conſider my ſelf in this Life, there is not a moment which I live, or wherein I have any contentation, or comfort, or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, but all this I have from his Influence and Bounty; and certainly it concerns me highly to know my Benefactor, from whom I receive my Good, that I may depend upon him, be thankful unto him, probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate him, and make my applications to him for what I want. Again, the wiſeſt men that have ſearched after happineſs in this Life, though they have miſſed of the place where it is to be found, have with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon placed the beſt happineſs that can be found on this ſide Death, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Virtue and the exerciſe thereof, or in Tranquillity of mind, or in both, for they are rarely aſunder. Now I may be an excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician, a man well ſeen in Natural Cauſes and Effects, an excellent Stateſman and Polititian, and yet be without that Goodneſs that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate me juſtly a good man, and without that tranquillity of mind that may make me a happy man: but the true knowledge of God, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and really dwelling and digeſted in the Soul, makes a man a good man, and a happy man; it makes a man to love, fear, honour and obey him that he thus knows. A man cannot truly know him, but he muſt know that in him, which by a moral neceſſity raiſeth in a man thoſe Habits and Diſpoſitions, namely, of Religious Piety towards God, Juſtice and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to men, Sobriety in relation to himſelf, for in knowing this God, he knows that theſe things are well-pleaſing to him, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64147:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſpleaſeth him, and he knows him to be a God that knows all things in the world, and that is a bountiful Lord to them that love and obey him, and a juſt Judge of them that deſpiſe or forſake him. And as thus it makes him good, ſo it makes him happy, by giving him the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt firm Tranquillity of Mind that can be; for he knows that this moſt gracious and powerful God orders and governs all the things in the world with irreſiſtible power, exquiſite and infinite wiſdom, and abundant goodneſs, and that he is well pleaſed with them that love, fear and obey him; and upon all theſe accounts a man rejoyceth in his Favour, depends upon his Power, Goodneſs, Wiſdom and All-ſufficiency, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes himſelf to his Will; is contented and patient under all conditions, and ſo doth enjoy perfect tranquillity of Mind.</p>
               <p>But this is the loweſt portion of the uſefulneſs of Divine Knowledge. There is another Life after this, a Life of eternity, and the influx of the knowledge of God in relation to this everlaſting Life, is infinitely of more moment; it fills the Soul with a capacity of it, with a ſutableneſs and ſtate of congruity to it, with thoſe preparations, diſpoſitions and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits that are neceſſarily pre-requiſite for it, and gives him the fruition and perfect enjoyment of it: That meaſure of the knowledge of God that we attain, is the beſt happineſs we enjoy in this Life, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our happineſs in the Life to come, where we ſhall have a more perfect intellectual Viſion of the Glorious God, and as full a fruition of the Goodneſs of God, as that elevated Nature which we ſhall then have, can be capable of: Then that meaſure of the knowledge of God which we here acquire, ſhall be refined and advanced to a degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſutable to the advance that this Intellective Faculty ſhall then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; and that meaſure of goodneſs that by the means of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is wrought in the Soul in this Life, ſhall then be improved to a higher degree of excellence, and rewarded with a weight of Glory.</p>
               <p>This Knowledge therefore of all other Knowledge is to be preferred: And in all our buſie inquiſitions touching other things, we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our ſelves, as our Lord remembred <hi>Martha</hi> in the Goſpel. We are buſie about many things, and trouble our ſelves with many Enquiries; but there is one thing, one Object, and the knowledge thereof neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, namely, the knowledge of the glorious God: <hi>This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Christ whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> John 17.3. Whatever therefore we endeavour to know, it muſt be with ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the endeavour after this knowledge: And as far as is poſſible, all other knowledge, and deſire thereof, ſhould be directed to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this Knowledge, or in order to it, and to the end acquira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond profitable and uſeful Object of our Knowledge, is, the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Knowledge of our ſelves: And next to the Knowledge of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, and his Will, and his Son, this Knowledge of our ſelves, ſeems moſt worthy of our endeavour: And therefore I have choſen this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for my ſearch and examination at this time: For in this Subject we ſhall find all thoſe Qualifications or Requiſites before-mentioned, that commend any Subject to our Enquiry or Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Of any one viſible Subject in the compaſs of created Nature, there is

none that we know and are acquainted with, that hath more worth and excellency next to the great Creator of all things, and the holy Angels; and that which ſeems to be moſt noble, the Image of the glorious God; namely, the Univerſe, as it comprehends the Syſteme, Order and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of all created Beings, digeſted into their ſeveral Ranks and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and collected and put together into that glorious Frame of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: But as it is impoſſible for us, at leaſt in this Life, by any means to be acquainted with all the Integrals of that glorious Structure, ſome are in their nature imperceptible by our Senſe; namely, the Spiritual Beings; yea, and the more refined parts of material Exiſtences, which by reaſon of their ſubtilty, eſcape our perception: Other parts thereof are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, that although they might in their own nature be perceived by Senſe, yet they are at that remote diſtance from us, that they eſcape our Sight, though the moſt active Senſe we have. And again, the vaſt extent of the Univerſe is ſuch, that though we might ſucceſſively ſee the parts of it, yet it is not phyſically poſſible to ſee it at one view; and conſequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſee at once that beautiful and glorious Image of the more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and glorious God in its full complement repreſented in the entire Frame of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>Again, we cannot but ſuppoſe that there are divers Ranks of created Beings intermediate between the glorious God and Man, which far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs man in perfection of Nature and Operations; as the glorious Angels, and created Intelligences; nay poſſibly there may be material Beings of a more refined ſubſtance, and endued with more advanced Forms than ours. Who knows whether the Stars are not furniſhed with intellectual Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more excellent for their Subſtance and Forms, than we Mortals? Yea, and for ought we know, the Stars themſelves may have Forms ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to them, of a more excellent frame than ours; though, as I have before ſaid, this exceeds our determination.</p>
               <p>But although theſe things may be, yet we know not that they are; and if they were, yet we are unacquainted with their natures and kinds; only the reality of exiſtence of Angelical Creatures, and created ſeparate Intelligences, and the poſſibility of Nobler Creatures or Natures than ours, reſiding in ſome parts of the Univerſe, may teach us not to be ſo over-prizing and over-valuing our ſelves, as to think that there are no other Creatures intermediate between God and Man, of a greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection than Man. We ſee a multitude of Creatures between us and the loweſt rank of Animals ſpecifically and gradually one below another; and doubtleſs there are, or may be, many ranks of Beings intermediate between the glorious God and Mankind, that have ſpecifical gradations one above another.</p>
               <p>But whatever may be ſaid touching theſe, yet certainly of all the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures that we are acquainted with, Man ſeems to have a very great Prerogative of excellence. And though he may not bear ſo fair and ſo noble an Image of the Divine Glory as the Univerſe in its full Syſteme and Order, or as thoſe nobler Beings that are of a Rank and Nature above him, yet certainly he bears a greater meaſure of the Divine Image, than any one viſible Creature we know; and ſo far forth as we know: God himſelf affirms thus much of Man, that he created him after his own Image; which he ſayes not of any of the Celeſtial Bodies themſelves;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64147:14"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. Man therefore is a Creature, that of all viſible Creatures that we know, is the nobleſt.</p>
               <p>We may obſerve in the Creatures of a ſubordinate rank to us, how the more inferiour and ignoble bear ſomewhat of the Image of the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, a kind of ſhadow or adumbration of thoſe perfections that in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour are more perfect, not only by a gradually, but ſpecifically differing perfection. We ſee in ſome Metals an Analogical reſemblance of thoſe vital effects of Vegetables, growth, digeſtion and augmentation that is more perfectly in Plants and perfect Vegetables: We ſee in Vegetables a reſemblance of Appetition, Election, Generation, and in ſome of them an imperfect Image of that univerſal ſenſe of Feeling which we find more perfectly in Animals: We find in Animals, eſpecially ſome of them, as Foxes, Dogs, Apes, Horſes and Elephants, not only Perception, Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie and Memory (common to moſt, if not all Animals) but ſomething of Sagacity, Providence, Diſciplinableneſs, and a ſomething like unto a Diſcurſive Ratiocination, bearing an analogy, image or imperfect reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of what we find, though in a degree, ſpecifically more excellent in the humane Nature, inſomuch that <hi>Porphiry, Plutarch, Sextus Emperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Patricius,</hi> and ſome others have been bold to make reaſonableneſs not the ſpecifical difference of the Humane Nature; and ſome latter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would not have the Definition of a man to be <hi>Animal Rationale,</hi> without the addition of <hi>Religioſum;</hi> wherein he ſeems particularly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Brutal Nature: Although in truth that which ſeems to be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Brutes, is nothing elſe but the Image and Analogical repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that true Reaſon that is in Man, as the Water-gall is the Image, Shadow, or weak Repreſentation of the Rainbow.</p>
               <p>And we have reaſon to think that that intellective and volitive power which is in Man, bears an Image and Repreſentation of the like power that is in Angels and ſeparate Intelligences, though neither of equality to that perfection that is in them, either in degree or kind.</p>
               <p>And although it were too great preſumption to think that there is any thing in any created Nature, that can bear any perfect reſemblance of the incomprehenſible perfection of the Divine Nature (very Being it ſelf not predicating univocally touching him and any created Being and Intellect, and Will, as we attribute them to God, are, as we may reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably think, not only of a Perfection infinitely tranſcending any created Intellect and Will, but of another kind and nature from it) yet though we are not able to comprehend the excellence of the Divine Nature, we cannot frame unto our ſelves a conception of him without the notion of Intellect and Will, though infinitely perfect: It ſeems that thoſe two great Faculties in us, bear a weak Analogy with, and Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Nature. And therefore in that reſpect, Man is the Image and Repreſentation of the Glorious God, though the diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between him and this his Image, be infinitely more than the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his Image upon his Coin, or the Sun in the Heaven, and the Shadow of him in a Baſon of Water.</p>
               <p>And in this reſpect, the Humane Nature is a worthy and noble Object of our Enquiry and Knowledge, becauſe here is the beſt viſible Image of Almighty God that we can fully acquaint our ſelves with, next to him that was the Brightneſs of the Fathers Glory, and expreſs Image of his perſon, Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64147:14"/>And beſides this relative conſideration of the Humane Nature, with relation to thoſe Beings that are above him, Man is an excellent Object of contemplation; ſo if we look upon him either abſolutely in himſelf, or with relation to Creatures of an inferiour nature, he is a worthy and noble object of our contemplation.</p>
               <p>If we conſider him abſolutely in himſelf, he is an Object worthy of our contemplation; he is admirable in excellent compoſure and figuration of his Body, and in every part apart, and in the whole ſtructure put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, admirable in the Nature, Faculties, and Excellence of his Soul, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in the conjunction of both together, admirable in all the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Life, Senſe, Intellect and Will, which he exerciſeth in this ſtate of conjunction and union, admirable in his production and generation, and admirable as to the condition of his Soul in its ſtate of diſunion and ſeparation. The ſpeculations concerning him, are all full of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, curioſity and worth, becauſe the Subject it ſelf is ſuch.</p>
               <p>If we conſider him with relation to other created Beings of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour nature; Firſt, he comprehends all the excellencies that are in the inferiour ranks of Being, and that for the moſt part in a more excellent and perfect manner: The Life that is in Vegetables, and the operations of that Life; the Life and Senſe that is in Senſibles, and the excellent operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, all Senſation, Perception, Memory, Phantaſie, Nutrition; with its ſeveral proceſs, the faculties of Appetition, Paſſion, Generation; The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Parts and Organs that are beſt in any Animal are to be found in the diſpoſition, order and texture of the Body of man; and wherein it differs, it differs with much advantage and prelation over the ſtructure of the Bodies of Animals; ſo that the knowledge of Man gives us a full account of the excellence of others, either Animals or Vegetables: He that well knows Man, knows whatſoever is excellent in the Animal or Vegetable Nature. Secondly, Beſides theſe Excellencies common either to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable or Animal Nature, and Man, there are certain excellencies ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to the Humane Nature, certain ſpecifical prelations in his Body, the Structure, Poſture, Beauty and Majeſty thereof, certain ſpecifical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and uſefulneſs in ſome of his Organs, the diſpoſition of his Hand, Brain, Nerves and other Integrals: Again, the ſpecifical Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of his Soul in thoſe great and admirable Faculties of Intellect and Will; Of all which in their due time: So that he that is well acquainted with, and knows Man, knows whatſoever is excellent in the Vegetable and Animal Nature, and much more.</p>
               <p>So that upon the whole account, we have a Noble and Worthy Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Contemplations, in the contemplation of Man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the contemplation of Man we have an Object that doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much confound us with its exceſſive multiplicity; and yet it doth not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate, nor proves ingrateful for want of ſufficient variety: Touching the former of theſe, it hath been before obſerved, that he that goes about to make the whole Univerſe and all the ſeveral parts thereof the buſineſs of his Enquiry, as he ſhall find that there are many things therein that he cannot come at, or make any diſcovery of, ſo among thoſe parts of the Univerſe that are objected to a greater diſcovery of our Senſes, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity is ſo great, that a man of the moſt equal and firm conſtitution, muſt deſpair of Life enough to make a ſatisfactory, particular and deep en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64147:15"/>
into them: But the Object in hand is but one; it is Man, and the Nature of Man.</p>
               <p>I confeſs it is true, that he that ſhall make it his buſineſs to take in as it were, by way of a common place, all thoſe things that may be taken up under this conſideration, and follow all thoſe Lines that concenter in this, or almoſt any other the moſt ſingle piece of Contemplation, will make this Subject large enough; and upon that account may be drawn in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all things imaginable: We find in the conſideration of the Humane Nature, a Subſtance, a Body, a Spirit: We find the ſeveral Objects of his Senſes, Light, Colour, Sound, and infinite more: He that upon this account will take in the diſtinct and large conſiderations of theſe and the like Appendices to Humane Nature, in their full amplitude, will have a large Plain, that will more than exhauſt his Life, before he come to the Subject it ſelf which he deſignes. Again, there is an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of collateral conſiderations that yet are relative to man; hither comes all the conſiderations of Theology, Phyſick, Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, Politicks, the conſiderations of Speech, Government, Laws, of Hiſtory, Topography, of Arts, of thoſe Sciences that relate to the Senſes, of Opticks, Muſick, and infinite more; for all theſe have a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Man, and are like ſo many Lines drawn from ſeveral Objects that ſome way relate to him, and concenter in him; and he that ſhall make it his buſineſs to follow all thoſe Lines to their utmoſt, ſhall make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Man almoſt as large as the contemplation of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
               <p>When I ſay therefore the contemplation of Man is the contemplation of a ſingle Object, I mean, when it is kept into thoſe ſingle bounds of Man in his own ſpecifical Nature, and under the phyſical contemplation of his Nature, Parts and Faculties, as they are appropriate unto him. And then it is a Subject that we may poſſibly make ſome progreſs in its contemplation and conception within the period of the time, that by the ordinary time of Life, and the permiſſion of neceſſary avocations, a man may employ in ſuch a contemplation.</p>
               <p>And yet ſecondly, though in this reſtrained notion, the Subject ſeems to be reſtrained and ſingle, we ſhall find it no very narrow Subject; but there will be buſineſs enough in it to employ our Faculty, and to take up that time, which either more neceſſary, or more imporunate thoughts or employments will allow us; and variety enough to entertain our thoughts with delight, contentation and uſefulneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Third Commendation of this Object to our contemplation, is this, that therein we have more opportunity of certainty and true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Object enquired into, than we can have in any other Object, at leaſt of equal uſe, worth and value: Many excellent things there are in Nature, which were very well worth our Knowledge, but yet, as hath been ſaid, either by reaſon of their remoteneſs from us, unacceſſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, ſubtilty and imperceptibleneſs to us, either are not at all ſuſpected to be, or are not ſo much as within any of our Faculties to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or diſcover what they are; or in caſe we have any conception that there may be ſomething of that kind, yet our Notions touching them, are but products of Imagination and Phantaſie, or at beſt, very faint, weak, ungrounded and uncertain conjectures, and ſuch as we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64147:15"/>
can never prove to the ſatisfaction of others or our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Our Senſe is the beſt evidence that we have in Nature, touching the exiſtence of corporeal things without us, and where that is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to be exerciſed, we are naturally at a great uncertainty whether things are, or what they are. Now the Underſtanding perceives or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands things by the aſſiſtance of Senſe in a double manner. 1. It ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perceives them immediately, as being immediately objected to, and perceptible to the Senſe; as I perceive the Sun and the Stars by my ſight; I find that there is a Body hard or gentle, or hot or cold, by my Touch; and accordingly my Underſtanding judgeth of them: Or ſecondly, though the Senſe perceive not the Object immediately, yet it doth repreſent certain ſenſible effects or operations; and though by thoſe effects or operations the Underſtanding doth not immediately conclude anything elſe to be, but what the Senſe thus feels or ſees; yet the Underſtanding ſometimes by rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination, and ſometimes by the Memory doth infer and conclude ſomething elſe to be beſides what the Senſe immediately repreſents either as the cauſe or the concomitant of it, and doth as forcibly and truly conclude the thing to be, and alſo ſometimes what the nature of that cauſe or concomitant is, as if it were ſeen by the Eye, or felt by the Hand.</p>
               <p>I do not ſee, nor by any Senſe perceive the quiet, undiſturbed Air; yet becauſe I do ſee that a Bladder, that was before flaccid, doth ſwell by the reception of that which I ſee not, I do as truly and certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there is ſuch a ſubtil Body which we call Air, as if I could ſee it as plain as I ſee the Water: I do not ſee the Animal or Vital Spirits, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they, by reaſon of their ſubtilty and volatileneſs, be diſcovered immediately to the Senſe; yet when I ſee that forcible motion of the Nerves and Muſcles, I do as certainly conclude, there are ſuch Inſtruments which the Soul uſeth for the performance of thoſe motions, as if I ſaw them: I come into a Room where there is no viſible or tangible Fire, yet I find by my Senſe the Smoke aſcending, I do as forcibly conclude that Fire is or hath been near, as if I ſaw it; becauſe my ſenſible experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and memory tells me they are concomitant. Upon the ſame account it is, that when my Senſe and ſenſible experience ſhews me that theſe and theſe effects there are, and that they are ſucceſſively generated and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, though my eye ſees not that God that firſt made thoſe things, yet my Senſe having ſhewed me theſe ſenſible Objects, and the ſtate and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſtude of them, my Underſtanding doth truly conclude that all this viciſſitude of things muſt terminate in a firſt cauſe of things, with as great evidence and conviction, as if my Senſe could immediately ſee or perceive him: So that in the ordinary way of Nature, and without the help of divine Revelation, all our certainty of things natural, begins at our Senſes; namely, the immediate ſenſe of the things themſelves, or the ſenſe of thoſe effects and operations which after by the help of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are carried up to the diſcovery of things not perceptible by Senſe immediately.</p>
               <p>Now there may be many things in Nature unto which we can have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe acceſſions of Senſe: How many Stars are now diſcovered by the Teleſcope, which were never before known, becauſe not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Senſe? And how many more there may be, which are not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to us by that help, we cannot yet know till that diſcovery; We
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64147:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cannot know what the extent of the Univerſe is, whether there be any Worlds without the compaſs of this; whether the Heavenly Bodies are inhabited, and with what Creatures: We cannot know the Nature, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, Faculties of created and ſeparate Intelligences, nor the manner of their <hi>Ubi,</hi> Motion, Intellection, mutual Intercourſe, or detection of their Minds: Theſe things are out of the reach of our Senſe either mediately, or immediately; and conſequently without the help of Divine Revelation, we can never upon a natural account, come to any certainty in them; or the moſt we can otherwiſe know, is by conſidering the reflexed acts of our Underſtanding, whereby we know many acts of our own minds and Soul, which are not perceptible to our external Senſes; and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we may think that <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> their perception may be ſomething ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical; But Man is an Object of greateſt vicinity to himſelf, and hath thereby, and by other contributions, the beſt opportunity to know and underſtand himſelf with the greateſt certainty and evidence.</p>
               <p>And yet it cannot be denied, that notwithſtanding this great proximity of Man to himſelf, yea, and notwithſtanding the many and great Eſſayes, Attempts, Enquiries and Obſervations that have been made in all ſucceſſions of Ages, by men of excellent Parts, Learning and Induſtry, we ſtill remain, and are like ſtill to remain ignorant of many things of importance concerning our ſelves: The great and wiſe God whoſe Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is to conceal a matter, having lodged many things in the Humane Nature, and Fabrick, and Conſtitution thereof ſo ſecretly and ſo cloſely, that notwithſtanding the Experience and Obſervation of near 6000 years, and the ſearch and induſtry of the beſt Judgments in all Ages, and the cloſe proximity of Man to himſelf, there are very many things in our Nature, whereof we neither can, and probably never ſhall be able to give any account to our ſelves or others, with any evident, nay with any tolerable certainty; as if the Divine Wiſdom meant hereby to give to the Children of Men an inſtance to keep them humble, that cannot find out the certainty of what they hourly moſt intimately converſe withal; and an indication of his own profound and infinite Wiſdom, that can thus keep ſecret thoſe things, which in regard of their proximity to us, we have great opportunity to know.</p>
               <p>And of this nature are many things which we know to be, but we cannot give our ſelves any ſufficient explication of the manner or reaſon of them. We are certain we have a vital, active Principle in us, by which we ſee, underſtand, remember; which we call the Soul. But whence that Soul comes, or how, and when, and in what manner it is united to the Body, whether it be extended with the Body, or indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in every point of the Body, how and in what manner it exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth its nobler acts of Intellection and Volition, or how far forth it ſtands in need of the Organs actually to exert any of thoſe operations; or how far forth it doth or may exert them without it: how or by what means the <hi>Species</hi> not only of ſenſible Objects, but even of Notions of the Mind are preſerved in the Memory without confuſion and diſſipation, notwithſtanding lapſe of time, and intervention of infinite variety of Objects: whether it be the ſame individual principle that exerciſeth the acts of Intellection, and likewiſe of Senſe and Vegetation; and if it be, what become of theſe Faculties ſubſervient to a temporal Life, in the ſtate
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64147:16"/>
of ſeparation of the Soul: where it is that the exerciſe of Senſe is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; whether in the Brain, or by the Soul, by the mediation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the extremity of the Nerves; and if the former, how the <hi>Species</hi> of Viſibles are carried through thoſe dark Caverns between the <hi>Organ</hi> and <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> ſuppoſed to be the Seat of the common Senſe. Theſe and many more difficulties, ſcarce explicable with any ſufficient certainty, do occur in the little Shop of the Fabrick of Humane Nature. We muſt not therefore think, that becauſe of this nearneſs to our ſelves, all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of our Nature can be rendred as evidently explicable as we do or may underſtand the Fabrick of our Hand by Anatomical Diſſection.</p>
               <p>But though this vicinity of our ſelves to our ſelves, cannot give us the full proſpect of all the Intrigues of our Nature, yet we have thereby, and by other opportunities, much more advantage to know our ſelves, than to know other things without us, and by that opportunity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſelves, to know the truth or falſhood, or analogy of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things without us, which otherwiſe could not be ſo well known or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have hereby an opportunity to know the Conſtitutions, Frame and Order of our Bodies; It is true, the great advance of the practice and skill of Anatomy hath laid open to ocular inſpection the Fabrick of the Bodies, as well of Brutes and Birds, as Men; and therein they ſeem to be equally obvious to our knowledge: But a Brute or a Man are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, when they are alive, from what they are when dead: Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy can give us the Poſition, Frame, Situation, Figure and connexion of all the ſeveral Integrals of the Body of Man or Beaſt; but it is the living Mans obſervation of himſelf, that muſt give account of thoſe Vital mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in the Body when living; as the Pulſations of the Heart, the Circulation of the Blood, the Communication of the Parts, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity or Diſagreement between my Nature and other things variouſly qualified: The Humor that ſeparates, divides, attenuates and digeſts the Nouriſhment; the ſeveral exertions of the ſeveral Organs relating to their ſeveral Functions, the things that impede or advance the vital or ſenſible operations in a man, what impreſſions are made upon the Blood and Spirits by the ſeveral paſſions of the Mind, what things increaſe or advance the Spirits, what diſorder or diſcompoſe them; the immediate and agil ſubſervience of the Spirits to the Empire of the Mind or Soul. Theſe and infinite more touching the Body, are diſcoverable by Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by no other Obſervation, ſo well as by a mans Obſervation of himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have hereby an opportunity to know much more of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Operations and other things relating to our Souls, than we can touching other things or Natures. There hath been much Diſpute among Learned men, concerning the manner of the Intellection of Spirits and Intelligences; and by others, touching the knowledge of Brutes, touching their remembring Faculty, whether they have a kind of Diſcurſive Faculty, which ſome call Reaſon; whether they do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcind or abſtract touching their Voyces; how far they are ſignificant, and whether they intentionally ſignifie by them, how far their Animal motions are ſpontaneous, or meerly mechanical, and which are of one kind, which of another; or whether, as <hi>Des Cartes</hi> would have it, all are purely Mechanical.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64147:17"/>Many vain things have been aſſerted by men that would be counted eminent Wits; but without debating in this place the truth of any of theſe things, it is no marvel if we are to ſeek what are the manner of theſe operations of abſtract Spirits or Brutes; we cannot know them, unleſs we were in them, ſo as to be acquainted with their inward motions, or at leaſt, unleſs they had ſome ſuch way of communicating their Perceptions and Phantaſms unto us, as we have to our ſelves, or one to another: But whatever can be known of them, we may eaſily by inſpecting and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves, know much concerning our own Souls and the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them: We may know that we have a principle within, which we do, as it were, feel diſtinct from our Bodies, whereby we think, and we know we think; whereby we do diſcurſively, and by way of ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation deduce one thing from another; whereby we abſtract, divide and define, whereby we have notions of things which were never derived to us by Senſe, as the Subſtance or the <hi>Subſtratum</hi> of thoſe Accidents of things which are derived to us by our Senſe; whereby we do correct the errors of our Senſe, and judge otherwiſe touching things repreſented, than the Senſe repreſents them. The Senſe repreſents the Sun no bigger than a Buſhel; there is ſomewhat within us tells, and that truly, that it is bigger than the Earth, becauſe we find Diſtance diminiſheth the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Bodies: Our Senſe tells us that the repreſentation in the Looking-Glaſs, hath all the motions, the bulk, figure, colour of that corporeal <hi>Moles</hi> it repreſents, and repreſents the ſame under all the renditions of a Body, as it doth the thing it ſelf reflected; but there is that within tells us, and that truly, that it is but a meer ſhadow, and no real <hi>Subſtratum</hi> under that appearance of any ſuch corporeal <hi>Moles:</hi> We do moſt certainly know that there is that within us, that doth exerciſe a rational Empire over our paſſions and ſenſual appetite; that believes, hopes and acts in order to ends that reſpect another Life than that of Senſe, We do find, as it were, the principal ſeats of theſe operations, we feel our ſelves to underſtand in our Head, and that we will, and reſolve, and love, and hate, and pity in our Heart, almoſt as plainly as we find our ſelves ſee with our Eyes, or hear with our Ears: I feel the propenſions and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my Mind as really as I feel my Body to be cold or warm. I find in my ſelf that this inward principle doth exert many of its actions inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally and purpoſely; I reſolve and caſt about to remember things that I would remember; I caſt about for all circumſtances that may revive my Memory or Reminiſcence: When I command any Muſcle of my moſt remote Limb to move, it doth it in an inſtant; in the moment I will it; and hereby I underſtand the motions of my Mind are no way Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, though the motion of the Muſcle be ſuch; I move, ride, run, or ſpeak, becauſe I will do it, without any other phyſical impulſe upon me, and when I ſee many analogal motions in Animals, which though I cannot call them voluntary, yet I ſee them ſpontaneous; I have reaſon to conclude that theſe in their principle are not ſimply mechanical, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Mouſe-trap, or <hi>Architas</hi> his Dove moved mechanically, from an artificial principle. And becauſe I find that the remoteſt Muſcle in my Body moves at the command of my Will, and ſince I ſee the energy of my Soul in every particle of my Body, though not uſing intellectual actions in every part, yet uſing ſome that are imperate, as Local Motion;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64147:17"/>
ſome that are natural and involuntary, as the Pulſe of my Heart, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of my Blood, my Digeſtion, Sanguification, Diſtribution Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation: And becauſe at the ſame time I underſtand, conſider, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſpeak, walk, digeſt, and exerciſe, as well intelectual, imperate and involuntary actions, and all from the ſame vital Principle, though operating differently in ſeveral Faculties and Operations: I therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally feel that my Soul, though it hath the reſidence of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his nobler Faculties in my Head and Heart, yet it pervades my whole Body, and exerciſeth Vital Offices, proportionate to the Exigences or Uſe of every part, the Fleſh, the Bones, the Blood, the Spirits, Nerves, Veins, Arteries, Seminal Parts; and this I feel to be through my whole Body, and if I find any part of my Body be ſo mortified as it becomes like a rotten Branch of a Tree, whether it be Nerve or Joint, whereby that principle cannot communicate it ſelf to it, it putrifies and corrupts, and is not participant of the motion or influence derived from my Soul, becauſe it is now no longer in it to quicken it. And as I find my whole Body the Province or Territory of my Soul; in which it univerſally acts according to the different organization and uſe of every part, ſo I find that my Soul, as to its ſubſtantial exiſtence, is confined within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cints of it, and doth not phyſically act without it; and by all this I learn, that my Soul, if it be a Spirit, may be circumſcribed within the compaſs of a determinate ſpace, that though it be a Spirit, yet its operations while it is in the Body, may be, if not altogether, yet in a great meaſure, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical. I underſtand, remember and reaſon better in my health, than in my ſickneſs; and better in my riper years, than when I was a Child, and had my organical Parts leſs digeſted and inconcocted: And though it be a Spirit, yet I find it is no inconvenience to have ſome analogy, at leaſt of co-extenſion, with my Body. And although it may be a ſimple Spirit, and univocally and eſſentially the ſame, as well in my Toe, as my Head, yet according to the variety of the diſpoſition and organization of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of my organical Body, it exerciſeth variety of operations; the ſame Soul that underſtands in the Brain, and ſees in the Eye, and hears in the Ear, neither underſtands, nor ſees, nor hears in the Fingers, but moves and feels.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many ſuch Perceptions I have touching that principle of Life, Senſe and Intellection within me; and of theſe I have as great a certainty as poſſibly I can have of any thing in the world. Firſt, Although I cannot immediately have any immediate ſight of my Soul, or of its immediate operations, or internal actings, yet I ſenſibly ſee and feel the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with as great an evidence and demonſtration that it is ſuch, as if I ſaw the Principle it ſelf, and its immediate operations. I ſenſibly ſee and feel that my Hand or Foot moves upon the command of that principle within me: And when that principle is removed by a total deprivation, as Death; or by a partial deprivation, as in a mortified Limb or Member; or by a temporary ſuſpenſion, as in an <hi>Apoplexy</hi> or <hi>Deliquium Animi;</hi> I am ſure there is no ſuch motion, becauſe that principle is abſent in Death, or its operation ſuſpended in caſe of ſuch Diſeaſes: It was therefore a principle that was within, diſtinct from my Body, that while it was there, exerted this Empire, and was obeyed in it. Secondly, In thoſe actings of my Soul, which are not in themſelves perceptible by any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64147:18"/>
effect, yet I have as firm and certain an evidence that they are ſuch, as if I had a ſenſible perception of them: When I think, or underſtand, or remember, or abſtract, or divide, or define, or purpoſe, or will, it is moſt certain theſe effects or intrinſick operations of my mind are not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly perceptible by my ſight, or hearing, or taſte, or ſmell, or feeling; they are objects of ſuch a nature, that fall not under any perception of any of thoſe Senſes; yet I am as certain, if not much more certain, that I do think, or remember, or abſtract, or reaſon, or reſolve, or will, as that I hear, or ſee, or feel; and I do as certainly know before I write, what I am now writing, that I think or reaſon touching the things I am writing, or that I reſolve or purpoſe to write them, as I am certain that I have written them when I have written them; for the motions of my mind are as certainly obvious to a perception in me anſwerable to them (which I call the reflex act of the Soul, or the turning of the intellectual eye inward upon its own actions) as the motions or rather paſſions of my Senſe are certainly obvious to my Senſe; I ſee the Object, and I perceive that I ſee it: And therefore though he was a little too poſitive that ſaid, <hi>Ego cogito,</hi> was, as it were, <hi>primum cognitum,</hi> yet certainly herein he was irrefragably true, that there cannot be any thing more certain and evident to a man that thinks, than that he doth think; and yet that Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not perceptible by any of our five Senſes. Thirdly, But there is yet a farther opportunity of very much certainty in that knowledge that a man may have of himſelf, and of thoſe things concerning himſelf; by that converſation, by the help of ſpeech or ſigns that he hath, or may have with other men. Man only, of all viſible Creatures, having this priviledge of communicating his thoughts and conceptions by inſtituted ſigns of ſpeech or writing; and by this a man acquires a threefold ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added certainty of what he may or doth know concerning himſelf: Namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He thereby knows that there is a ſpecifical Identity between him and other men, and that they agree in one common rational Nature; for by mutual ſpeech we find that we have both alike an intellective, diſcurſive Faculty, as I do reaſon, ſo doth he; as I divide, define, abſtract, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, determine, will, ſo doth he uſe the like operations of his Mind; and although oftentimes intereſt and miſapprehenſion make us differ in our concluſion, yet he endeavours to maintain his Concluſion by the like method of Reaſon and diſcurſive Ratiocination as I do; and moſt times when prejudice and miſapprehenſions are removed, that which ſeems reaſonable to him, ſeems ſo to me; whereby it appears that we concenter in one common Nature, and that the Principle of Reaſon and Reaſonable Soul is common to us both, and that we meet in one common rational Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He likewiſe knows that as they concenter in one common rational Nature, ſo every one of that <hi>Species,</hi> hath yet an individual Principle of his own, that individuates, and perſonally diſcriminates one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For till we mutually communicate our thoughts by inſtituted ſigns, he knows not what I think or purpoſe, nor I what he thinks or purpoſeth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This adds a certainty to me that I am not deceived in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections that I make upon my ſelf, and the collections I make from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64147:18"/>
them; for as I do find I think, I reaſon, abſtract, divide, define, purpoſe, ſo I find by the help of Speech and Signs that he hath the very like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal operations; and as I do find that thoſe do ariſe from a principle different and diſtinct from that <hi>moles Corporea</hi> which I have, ſo I find that he hath the ſame perception of the original of theſe internal operations, and attributes them to a Principle in him diſtinct from the Body: So that if I might have any imaginable doubt of thoſe reflexed perceptions which I have touching thoſe appropriate operations of my own Mind, I am confirmed in them, becauſe I find the like perceptions in all the men I converſe with. And thus far touching the third Commendable in the ſearch of our ſelves, namely, Certainty and Evidence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth advantage of this ſubject and the knowledge thereof is, the profit and uſefulneſs thereof: Next to the knowledge of Almighty God, and our Bleſſed Saviour, and the Sacred Scriptures, there is not any ſubject in the World that is more neceſſary and uſeful to be known than the Humane nature, with thoſe incidents that do neceſſarily fall into that conſideration; and of all the knowledge that relates to man, there is nothing of greater moment or uſe to be known than Man under the Phyſical notion of his Body and Soul, and both united together. And the uſefulneſs of this Conſideration diſtributes it ſelf into theſe two kinds; Uſefulneſs in reference to Speculation or Knowledge, and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in relation to Practice or Exerciſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the Speculative Uſefulneſs there is this to be ſaid, that there is in the contemplation of Man a means of diſcovery and explication of very great and momentous truths. And although poſſibly the very ſame truths may be elicited, and in ſome meaſure explicated by parallel <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the contemplation of Animals, yet they are more clearly and eminently evidenced in the contemplation of Man, who, by how much the more excellent and noble a Creature he is above Brutes, and by how much he is the more obſervable to himſelf than they can be, by to much the more uſeful and excellent is the knowledge of himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Speculative truths which I ſhall chuſe to inſtance in ſhall be theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The due contemplation of the Humane nature doth by a neceſſary connexion and chain of Cauſes, carry us up to the unavoidable acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Deity; becauſe it carries every thinking man to an original of every ſucceſſive individual thereof by a courſe of generation, till it come to a common Parent of the whole <hi>Species,</hi> the immediate workmanſhip of the Glorious God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſequently, it gives every conſidering man a ſound and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that the efficient of this firſt Parent of Mankind, is a moſt wiſe, moſt powerful and beneficent Being. For the true proſpect of the Humane Fabrick in its eſſential and integral parts, in the fabrick of his Body, and the faculties and operation of his Soul muſt needs convince any man of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reaſon, that can obſerve but clear and evident conſequences, that the Efficient that firſt made this firſt root of Mankind was not only an intelligent Being, but a Being of moſt admirable Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs; for ſuch this effect doth neceſſarily declare its Efficient to be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As the contemplation of the Origination of the <hi>Species</hi> of Mankind gives us an aſſurance of the Exiſtence of the firſt Cauſe, and of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64147:19"/>
of Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs; ſo the contemplation of the ſecondary origination of Mankind, or the production of the Individuals by generation gives us an evidence of the like power, wiſdom, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and a little Emblem of the Divine Power in the Creation of the World. Any man that attentively conſiders the progreſs of the generative production of mankind, will find, that this goodly and noble Creature called Man hath its gradual formation and complement from a ſmall, almoſt imperceptible vital principle, which by the Divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is endued with ſuch a regular, orderly, and unerring power, that from moſt inconſiderable and unlikely materials builds up gradually the goodly frame of the Body, cloaths it ſelf with it, and exerciſeth an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Oeconomy over it: And this it doth not by ſuch a kind of choice, deliberation and forecaſt as the Watch-maker makes his Watch; for as yet this vital rational principle doth not exerciſe an actual ratiocination or diſcurſive deliberation, neither hath thoſe organs of Heart, and Brain, and Spirits, and Veſſels (by the help of which we exerciſe our Acts of Reaſon) till it hath made and framed them. And yet this admirable Frame is immediately wrought by this little particle which we call the Soul, and moulded, formed and perfected with an incomparable and uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring dexterity, skill, elegance, and curioſity more and greater than the moſt exquiſite Artiſt can ſhew in the moſt poliſhed piece of Artificial work.</p>
               <p>Now if this little ſpark of Life that in this work of generation and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is <hi>Vicarius Dei,</hi> the Inſtrument of his power and wiſdom; if this little imperceptible <hi>Archeus</hi> is endowed by the Divine power, wiſdom, and inſtitution with this admirable, regular, and effective power out of ſo ſmall, inconſiderable and unlikely materials to mould up and faſhion the goodly Fabrick of Humane Nature, and to perfect it for a complete habitation for it ſelf, wherein to exerciſe its moſt excellent oeconomy and operations; if this <hi>Puſillus divinae lucis radius, ex tantilla &amp; tam improbabili materiae particula mirandam naturae humanae fabricam tam affabrè, eleganter, &amp; inerrabundè formaverit.</hi> If we find in ſo ſmall a particle of a created Being this admirable energy, why ſhould we make a queſtion whether that God that at firſt gave this admirable energy to the Soul to frame ſo goodly a piece out of matter ſo near to nothing, ſhould not have power to create a World of matter out of nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, ſince I do ſee as plainly as I ſee my Paper that I now write upon, that this fabrication of the Humane Body is the immediate work of a Vital principle that prepareth, diſpoſeth, digeſteth, diſtributeth and formeth the firſt rudiments of the Humane nature when it is no bigger than a little Bean; that afterwards gradually augmenteth and perfecteth it to the goodly complement of a Man: And the ſame thing I ſee in the firſt rudiments of all generations as well vegetable as animal. It doth give to me (notwithſtanding all the bold confidence and conjectures of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and thoſe that follow him as far as for ſhame they durſt) I ſay it doth give me not only an undeniable evidence, but an exemplar in ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and explication, that the coalition of the goodly frame of the Univerſe was not the product of chance, or fortuitous concourſe of particles of matter, nor the ſingle effect of matter and motion; but of the moſt wiſe and powerful ordination of the moſt wiſe and glorious God, who thus
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64147:19"/>
ordered the World, and inſtituted that Rule, Order, or Law which we call Nature to be the Law of its future being and operation; if I ſee that the Coagmentation of a Man, nay of a Chicken or a grain of Wheat is not by caſualty, but the wiſe and powerful God hath committed the Coag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, Diſpoſition, and Formation thereof to their Seminal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>tanquam Vicariis &amp; ſubſtitutis Divini Numinis Inſtrumentis,</hi> as it were to Vicegerents and ſubſervient Inſtruments of the Deity: I have no reaſon to think that the goodly Frame of the Univerſe was the production of Chance, or Accident, or bare Matter, or its caſual motion or modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof; but that the ſame was the Contrivance and Work of the Great, Wiſe, and Glorious God, as a Work in a great meaſure anſwerable to the Excellency of ſuch an Efficient.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, I find a ſort of Men that pretend to much ſeverity of Wit, and would be thought too wiſe to be impoſed upon by Credulity, where they think they have not evidence enough of Senſe or Reaſon to convince them; that would be thought to be Men above the common rate; theſe have gone about, as far as they durſt, to exclude God out of the World, and pity thoſe Men as troubled with Credulity, and of weak Parts, that believe the Regiment of Divine Providence; a buſineſs that they think, or pretend to think may be made uſe of to impoſe upon the weaker part of Mankind, think it a Fiction, and ſuch as is utterly inexplicable to the ſatisfaction of a reaſonable and impartial judgment. Now the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Humane Nature, and that Oeconomy that the Active Principle in it ordinarily called the Soul doth exerciſe therein to my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, gives me both a reaſonable evidence of the Divine Providence governing the World, and a fair explication of it to me.</p>
               <p>I mean not in this place to examine the truth or falſity of the Plurality of Subordinate Forms, or whether there be two or three diſtinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Forms or Souls in Man, whereby he is <hi>Vivens, Sentiens, &amp; Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligens;</hi> for they are proper for a farther Examination in their proper place: But at preſent I do ſuppoſe, that that one Soul, whereby Man is conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Eſſe Hominis,</hi> is the ſingle Principle of all his operations of Life, Senſe, and Intellection; becauſe, as to this purpoſe which I am now upon, it comes all to one whether there be a Unity or Plurality of Subordinate Forms, or of Souls in the Humane Nature.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, in the Humane Fabrick we may obſerve two kinds of Forms, if I may ſo call them; the one, the <hi>Forma Corporis,</hi> as ſuch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it hath thoſe Properties or Operations which are common to Bodies of the like make or compoſition; whereby it is weighty and deſcends as other Bodies, it is figured, it hath dimenſions and qualities common to other Bodies; it hath in it ſome parts more active and fiery, others more paſſive and wateriſh, or earthy; it hath its tendencies to corruption and diſſipation: And though after the ſeparation of the Soul from the Body, it perchance loſeth ſome of thoſe particular Qualities, Figurations and Properties that it had before, yet it retaineth many of them; for many of theſe Proprieties of a Body as ſuch, do not depend upon the Specifical Form of the Humane Nature as ſuch: Again, there is in this Body a certain Active Specifical Form, whereby it is conſtituted in <hi>Eſſe Hominis,</hi> which hath in it, and doth communicate to the Body certain operations ſpecifical to it; by this he exerciſeth thoſe operations which either flow from or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64147:20"/>
are communicated by that Form, as Life, Senſe, Intellection, Volition, and the like: And though Life and Senſe be common to Man and Brutes, and their operations in many things alike, yet by this Form he lives the Life of a Man and not of a Brute, and hath the Senſe of a Man and not of a Brute: For there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Animal,</hi> or <hi>Vivens,</hi> not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined unto ſome particular <hi>Species,</hi> as there is no ſuch thing as a Man not determined in ſome individual: For Univerſals are but Notions and <hi>Entia Rationis,</hi> having their exiſtence only in the underſtanding power, and not in reality.</p>
               <p>And theſe Operations and Faculties of Humane Life, Humane Senſe, and Humane Underſtanding and Volition flow not from the corporeal <hi>Moles,</hi> but from ſome other active regent Principle that reſides in the Body, and governs it whiles it lives, which we call the Soul. And therefore although the corporeal <hi>Moles</hi> after ſome kinds of Deaths retain the ſame bulky Integrals, the ſame Figure, Colour, and many other accidents; yet the Soul being removed, the Faculties and Operations of Life, Senſe, and Intellection ceaſe from that <hi>Moles corporea,</hi> and are no longer in it.</p>
               <p>This Principle of Life, Senſe, and Intellection in Man called the Soul, hath the Body as its Province and <hi>Diſtrictus,</hi> wherein it exerciſeth theſe Faculties and Operations: and we ſhall find the Actions which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by it in the Body are of three kinds or natures; 1. Some are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, and not terminated immediately in any external or corporeal action. 2. Some are tranſient and ſpontaneous, terminating in the Body, or ſome parts or motions thereof. 3. Some tranſient, but involuntary, and exerciſed and terminated in or upon the Body.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeem to be the ſeveral kinds of Actions of the Soul, at leaſt relating to the Regiment and Oeconomical Government of the Soul upon the Body.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The internal and immanent Faculties and Acts of the reaſonable Soul (beſides thoſe of Common Senſe, Phantaſie, Memory, Paſſion and Appetite, common to Men and inferiour Animals) are Intellect and Will; and the proper Acts of the Intellect are Intellection, Deliberation, and Determination or Deciſion: The proper Acts of the Will are Volition, Nolition, Choice, Purpoſe or Reſolution, and Command in relation to Subordinate Faculties: And although there be many actings both of the Intellect and Will that are relative to other things or objects than what immediately concern the Microcoſm it ſelf; yet the principal part of that analogical Providence that the Soul exerciſeth in relation to the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm or Humane <hi>Compoſitum</hi> are Intellection, Deliberation, and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Underſtanding; and Choice, Volition, Nolition, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the Will; and theſe do or ſhould regularly precede all thoſe impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Acts of the Soul that relate to the <hi>Compoſitum:</hi> Before I write, or ſpeak, or go a journey, or eat, or any the like action, there is the deliberation of the Underſtanding, whether I ſhall do this action; the deciſion of the Underſtanding, that it is fit to be done; the choice of the Will to do it, the purpoſe of the Will that it ſhall be done: And although many times the diſtinction of theſe ſeveral procedures of the Soul do not always appear diſtinct, eſpecially in ſudden or ordinary actions, which ſeem to have but one act antecedent to the thing done, namely, the willing of it to be done;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64147:20"/>
yet in actions of weight and importance all theſe have their diſtinct order and procedure. For although in the moſt incomprehenſible and perfect Will of Almighty God there is no ſuch ſucceſſion of procedure; yet in the operations of the rational Soul that is linked to the Body, there is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily that ſucceſſive procedure of thoſe immanent acts of the Soul that relate to any thing to be done. This therefore is the firſt part of that analogical Providence that the Soul exerciſeth in relation to the Body, namely, deliberation or counſel, and deciſion in the Intellect; and choice and purpoſe in the Will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next Act, which immediately ſuccceds Purpoſe, is the Command that is given by the volitive Faculty of the Soul, and the Execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and herein are conſiderable, Firſt, The Power commanding, which is the Will, now determined by purpoſe or reſolution. Secondly, The things to which theſe commands relate, or the Object of them; which in relation to the Body is in effect nothing but motion of the Spirits, Nerves, Muſcles, parts of the Body, or the entire <hi>Compoſitum;</hi> by virtue of this command the Muſcles, the Hand, the Eye, the Tongue perform thoſe imperate commands of the Will; I do not digeſt, ſanguifie, nor my Heart move, nor my Blood circulate, nor my Meat digeſt by any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate command of my Will; but I eat, I drink, I move my Eye, my Hand, my Muſcles, my whole Body in purſuance of this command of my Will. Thirdly, The executive Inſtrument of this command mediately are my Nerves and Muſcles, but immediately thoſe ſubtil, inviſible and forcible Engins which we call the Animal Spirits; theſe being the moſt ſubtil parts in Nature, and parts of matter ſubtilized, next in degree of purity to that Soul that commands them, are in their nature proper, fit, and ſuitable to be the firſt recipients of the Empire of the Soul; they are the nimbleſt, agil, ſtrongeſt Inſtruments, fitteſt to be executive of the commands of the Soul; they are a middle nature between the Soul and the Body, the <hi>nexus animae</hi> to the Body; and theſe ſubtil Meſſengers ſpeedily diſpatch themſelves through the Nerves to the Muſcles, which are by theſe Spirits and the native <hi>Indoles</hi> that is in them and the exact texture of them fitted to move thoſe Integrals of the Body to which they ſerve; and as the Spirits ſhot through the Nerves are the firſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inſtruments of the Soul in its imperate acts, ſo the Muſcles are as it were the Inſtruments of the Spirits, or the remote Inſtruments of theſe imperate motions: And by this means the Soul hath the actual <hi>imperium</hi> and command of all thoſe motions of the Body which are ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous or capable of being commanded by the volitive Power of the Soul; 'tis by this the Eye-lid opens or ſhuts, the Eye is converted to this or that object, the Lungs are intended or remitted, the Tongue ſpeaks, the Hand ſtrikes or moves, the Foot walks, the Mouth opens or ſhuts, and all thoſe ſpontaneous motions ſubject to the Empire of the Will are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: And though I chuſe my Inſtance in the ſubject in hand, yet the like imperate motions are in Brutes and Animals, though not by the Empire of Will, which they have not, yet by a Faculty that moves in many things ſpontaneouſly in ſome analogy and adumbration of the Empire of the Will in Man, but incomparably below it both in perfection and freedom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, there be very many Operations, that although they flow
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64147:21"/>
from this active Principle, yet they are not acts that are imperate by the Will, but they are in a manner natural and unvoluntary; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I call them ſometimes Involuntary, ſometimes Natural, and they are very many and various; ſuch are many of the acts of Senſe, eſpecially the external. Though I do by the Empire of my Will direct the Motion or <hi>Acies</hi> of my Organ to this or that Object, yet my Eye, my Ear, my Touch, my Smell, my Taſt exerciſe their office of perception upon the Object duly applied to them, without any act of my Will commanding them ſo to do when they are joyned to their Object: So my Heart moves, my Blood circulates, my Meat digeſts, my Body is augmented, without any intention of mind to aſſiſt their actings. So if there be an ill humour in my Body, or a wound in my Hand or Leg, the Vital energy of my Soul thruſts out the Balſamical humour of my Blood to heal the latter, and uſeth all that Oeconomy that is proper for the expulſion or ſubduing of the former; ſometimes by <hi>puſtulae</hi> or eruptions in the fleſh, ſometimes by ſweat, ſometimes by urine, ſometimes by ſeige; and all this it doth in the moſt congruous way imaginable; ſo that the beſt Phyſicians have not better direction ordinarily in their applications, than to follow Nature in thoſe motions. And all this is done moſt exquiſitely, and yet without any deliberation or rational deciſion of the Underſtanding or Empire of the Will in relation to thoſe Natural motions. I ſhall only therefore obſerve concerning theſe Involuntary motions, 1. That though they are without any <hi>dictamen Rationis,</hi> yet they are done in a way of as great congruity to its end, as if they were directed by the wiſeſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the wiſeſt Soul; and it is reaſon good it ſhould, for it is a ſtanding and moſt wiſe Law of exerciſe planted by the moſt wiſe God in this Vital Principle for the regiment of the Body: And therefore though it be not directed by deliberation of the Humane Intellect, or choice of Humane Will, it is ſetled, contrived, implanted and directed there by a higher Wiſdom, even the Wiſdom of the moſt wiſe God: And this indeed is the reaſon of that Excellency that is ſeen in Inſtincts, even of Brutes, and the Formative proceſs in generation; that they ſo aptly and excellently attain their Ends: namely, becauſe theſe Inſtincts and Powers are the immediate Impreſſions, Signatures and Energies placed in them by the Great and Glorious God, whoſe very fooliſhneſs, as the Apoſtle tells us (namely the ſeemingly vileſt and loweſt Impreſſions of his Wiſdom) is wiſer than men. 2. The ſecond thing to be obſerved herein, is, That thoſe Natural and Involuntary actings are not done as the former, by deliberation and formal command, yet they are done by the virtue, energy, and influx of the Soul, and the inſtrumentality of the Spirits as well as thoſe Imperate acts before ſpoken of; wherein we ſee the immediate empire of the Soul: That Soul that moves my hand, my tongue, my foot by way of expreſs command and empire; digeſts, ſanguifies, carnifies, excerts and doth all thoſe Involuntary operations by it influence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: remove but the Soul, there is no more digeſtion, ſanguification, or any other acts of that kind, than there is ſpeech in the tongue. And although in ſome Inſects there appears a palpitation of the Heart for ſome little ſpace after it is ſevered from the Body; and in Chicken and other Fowl, after the ſeparation of the Head from the Body there is a motion of the parts divided, yet it laſts not long, and they are but the irregular
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64147:21"/>
and convulſive motions or ſtruglings of thoſe Spirits which could not ſo haſtily diſmiſs themſelves from the veſſels wherein they were incloſed.</p>
               <p>I would now obſerve ſome generals in relation to this Adumbration of Providence and analogical Oeconomy of the Soul in the Body, which are theſe: 1. That this analogical Providence of the Soul in relation to its Province the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> or Microcoſm is univerſal to every part of it; there is not the moſt inconſiderable particle of Fleſh, Bone or Artery, not the ſmalleſt Capillary Vein but it is preſent with, and auxiliary to it, according to its uſe and exigence, and the congruity of its conſtitution; it accommodates it ſelf to the Eye for ſeeing, to the Ear for hearing; and though it accommodate not it ſelf to the Finger in thoſe exertings of thoſe Senſes of Seeing or Hearing, yet it equally accommodates it ſelf to thoſe remote and ſmall Organs as perfectly in relation to Feeling, and to thoſe motions that are ſuitable to them. 2. That even thoſe Exertions of the active Energy of the Soul that ſeem moſt remote from the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Underſtanding and immediate active Empire of the Will, are guided and directed with all imaginable congruity to their ſeveral Ends and Uſes. 3. That this very ſame individual Soul may, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth exert all thoſe operations at the ſame time without any difficulty or confuſion: At the ſame time I think, I deliberate, I purpoſe, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: in inferiour Faculties; I walk, I ſee, I hear, I digeſt, I ſanguifie, I carnifie, my Lungs move ſwifter or ſlower by the empire and command of my Will, my Heart moves naturally by the motion of Palpitation, my Blood by the motion of Circulation, Excretion, Perſpiration; my Guts by the motion of Vermiculation, my Stomach and Inteſtines di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, the good ejects and expulſes the bad, my Diſeaſe is reſiſted and expelled, my Wound cured, and a thouſand more concurrent, coincident Motions; and all theſe performed at the ſame time by the Power, Energy and Oeconomy of one individual Soul; and yet all this done eaſily, and ſweetly, and perfectly; without either laſſitude, confuſion, or pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
               <p>And all this done by a little ſpark of Life, which in its firſt appearance might be incloſed in the hollow of a Cherry-ſtone; yet this little active Principle as the Body increaſeth and dilateth, evolveth, diffuſeth and expandeth if not his Subſtantial Exiſtence, yet his Energy and Virtue, to the utmoſt confines of his little Province and every particle and atom thereof; yea and it is of that abſolute neceſſity that it ſhould do ſo, that without it the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> would be diſſolved, and the Body diſſipated into corruption and its firſt principles, as we ſee it falls out ſuddenly after the ſeparation of the Soul from the Body: As the Body could not be reduced into that orderly frame in which it is conſtituted, without the Plaſtick and Formative power of the Soul, ſo it could never be upheld in that ſtate of Order and Convenience without the continued Influence of the Soul: The latter is as abſolutely neceſſary for its continuance and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as the former for its conſtitution.</p>
               <p>I eaſily foreſee two Objections againſt the Method propoſed; 1. That the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it ſelf is not ſufficiently evidenced: How do we know that this Oeconomy is the effect of a Power, or Nature, or Being diſtinct from the Body? and why may it not be the reſult of this Diſpoſition, Harmony, or Contemperation of qualities or parts of that Matter that conſtitutes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64147:22"/>
the Body? 2. And if it be, what need we magnifie the Humane Nature as the great Inſtructer in this buſineſs; ſince we may with a little obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation find very much the like in Brutes as well as Men? For there we find a ſenſible Perception and Phantaſie anſwering the Intellect in Man; an Eſtimative or Judicial faculty, an Appetition or Averſation and Loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motive faculty anſwering the Will; and the very Oeconomy of the animal Soul or Spirits managing as well their ſpontaneous actions as theſe natural or involuntary exertions of Digeſtion, Egeſtion, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and the reſt of thoſe Motions called Involuntary or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
               <p>To the Firſt of theſe I ſay, That this is not the place for a large reduction of theſe Operations to the regiment of the Soul as a diſtinct active Faculty, diſtinct from the Corporeal <hi>Moles</hi> and its contemperation, that ſhall, God willing, in its due place be at large diſcuſſed, which I am not here willing to anticipate. In the mean time, let the Objector but honeſtly and impartially examine and obſerve Himſelf, and he will need no other evidence of this truth but his own experience to ſatisfie him, that all thoſe effects proceed from an active, regnant Principle within him, diſtinct from the <hi>Moles corporea,</hi> or the contemperation thereof. The diſtemper of the humours of the Body cauſe ſometimes ſuch ſickneſs as diſorders the Phantaſie and Reaſon; but ſometimes though it diſtempers the Body, the Intellective faculty and operations are nevertheleſs free and ſound, as Experience ſhews. If this Objector was ever under a Sickneſs or Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the latter kind, let him give an account what it is that gives him under ſuch a Diſeaſe the uſe of his Reaſon.</p>
               <p>To the Second I need not ſay more than what I have before obſerved; namely, 1. That although the Inferiour Natures have a kind of Image of the Humane Nature, yet it is leſs perfect, and therefore no equal Inſtance in order to the explication of what I herein deſign. 2. As it is leſs perfect, ſo it is more diſtant and leſs evident to us, than our ſelves are or may be to our ſelves; the Regiment and Oeconomy of our own Souls in our Bodies and of them are more evident to us and percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by us, than that Regiment and Oeconomy that the Souls of Brutes exerciſe in them, and therefore fitter to be made our Inſtance of that which I go about thereby to illuſtrate; namely, the poſſibility, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and explication of the Divine Providence in the governing and influencing of the Univerſe and all the parts thereof; which I ſhall in the next place proſecute in the Analogy that this ſmall Regnant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple bears within its little Province to the Divine Regiment of the Univerſe.</p>
               <q>Sic parvis componere magna.</q>
               <p>I come therefore to the illuſtration of the Divine Providence, and Regiment of the World by the foregoing Emblem thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By this ſmaller Inſtance of this Regiment of this leſſer World by the immediate preſidency of the Soul, it ſeems evident that it is no way impoſſible but that the greater World may be governed by the Divine Wiſdom, Power, and Providence. It is true, there are theſe two diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities between theſe, namely, the greater World and the leſſer: The
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64147:22"/>
greater World is of a more vaſt extent; and again, the Integrals and Parts thereof are of greater multiplicity and variety; but neither of theſe are any impediment, becauſe the Regent thereof is of an infinite immenſity more than commenſurate to the extent of the World, and ſuch as is moſt intimately preſent with all the Beings of the World, and of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Underſtanding, Wiſdom, and Power that is able to apply it ſelf to every created Being, and therefore without any difficulty equally able to govern the whole and every part thereof: This we ſee in Natural agents; that little ſpark of Life, the Soul, that exerciſeth its regiment upon an Infant of a ſpan long, when the Body is grown to its due ſtature, and together with the extenſion of the Body this little Vital particle evolves and diffuſeth it ſelf to the extent of the enlarged Body, governs it with the ſame facility as it did before that extenſion. And the ſenſible Soul of a vaſt Whale exerciſeth its regiment to every part of that huge ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture with the ſame efficacy and facility as the Soul of a Fly or a Mite doth in that ſmall and almoſt imperceptible dimenſion to which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. For the Soul is expanded and evolved, and preſent to every part and the uttermoſt extremity of the greater as well as the leſſer Animal. And therefore if my Soul can have its effectual energy and regiment upon my Body with eaſe and facility, with how much more eaſe and facility can a Being of immenſe Exiſtence and Omnipreſence, of infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power govern and order a great but yet a finite Univerſe, and all the numerous yet not infinite parts thereof?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there is a poſſibility of ſuch a regiment of the Divine Wiſdom, Power and Influence in the Government of the World, ſo there is a neceſſity of it. It is not enough for the Soul of the Humane Nature to form and mould its Corporeal Vehicle, if it gave over its work when that were done, it would ſoon diſſolve, diſſipate and corrupt. There is the ſame neceſſity for the Divine Influence and regiment to order and govern, conſerve and keep together the Univerſe in that conſiſtence it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as it was at firſt to give it before it could receive it: The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of that Regiment and Divine Providence and Influx but a moment after the conſtitution of this World would have diſſolved its order and conſiſtence, if not annihilated its Being.</p>
               <p>And indeed, he that obſerves the great variety of things in the World, the many junctures and contributions of things that ſerve to keep up its conſiſtence, the want of any of which (as the diſorder of a little Nerve, Vein, or Artery in the Body) would bring it into a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; the continual ſtrife between contrary qualities, the ſtrange activity of the active Fiery Nature that involves it, or at leaſt is diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up and down in it; the vaſt and irregular concretions of Meteors, and thoſe ſtrange and various <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that are in the World, which as they proceed from or are found in the Integrals of the Univerſe, are devoid not only of Reaſon but of Senſe. And he that after all this ſhall ſee the World upheld without any conſiderable decay or defect, in the ſame ſtate and order as it hath been for many Thouſands of years, will upon a due and impartial ſearch find that it were far more impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that this could be without the Wiſdom, Power, and Influx of a moſt Infinite, Omnipreſent, Omniſcient and Omnipotent Fixed Being, than for the Humane Body to be kept without diſſolution and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64147:23"/>
being deſtitute of the influx and regiment of its Vital Principle the Soul.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſome of the Ancients that were willing to ſolve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the World, have (though erroneouſly) thought that the World was Animate, and that all theſe Operations in the World pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from that <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> as the Operations in the Bodies of Men proceeded from that <hi>Anima Humana</hi> that lodged in it; and at length finding ſo great effects that are and may be done by this ſuppoſed <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> according to their <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> have at laſt proceeded in plain terms to determine that this <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> was, in truth, no other than the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God; whereas they might with much more eaſe and truth have attributed all the great Oeconomy of the Univerſe to the moſt Glorious God, without diſhonouring him into the exiſtence of a <hi>Forma informans,</hi> or a conſtituent part of that World which he made.</p>
               <p>Others to amend that abſurdity, and yet out of a piece of mannerlineſs and reſpect, as they think, to God, though they deny this Univerſal Soul or Form informing of the whole Univerſe, yet without any ſufficient ground have deviſed ſeveral Syſtems of the Univerſe, and aſſigned ſeveral Souls to each Syſtem or <hi>Vortex</hi> at leaſt, which ſhould be the immediate Regent in every ſuch Syſtem, as the Soul is in the Body: This, as it ſuppoſeth ſomething without evident ground, ſo it doth without any neceſſity: For the Divine Wiſdom and Power is ſufficient for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and government of the whole Univerſe; and if ſuch <hi>Animae Syſtematum</hi> ſhould be granted, yet ſtill there muſt be ſome one common Regent of all theſe Syſtems and their reſpective Souls, or otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order would follow between the Syſtems themſelves.</p>
               <p>But thus far even thoſe ſuppoſitions bear witneſs to the neceſſity of a Providential Regiment of the parts of the Univerſe; that bare Matter, Motion, and Chance cannot perform this buſineſs, but that there is a perfect neceſſity of a Regent Principle beſides it, which may govern and diſpoſe it as the Soul of Man doth his Body: And even that ſuppoſed regiment of theſe particular Souls of every Syſtem, as they muſt needs have it, if they had it at all, from the inſtitution and efficiency of the Wiſe God, ſo they are all continually influenced from him, and the whole College of them governed, guided and ordered by him as their ſovereign Regent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Third thing that I deſign is this, That although it is impoſſible for any Created Being, or the Operations thereof, to hold a perfect Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy or adequate Repreſentation of the Divine Wiſdom, Power, and Providence in the governing of the World; becauſe the Wiſdom and the Ways of Almighty God are unſearchable and paſt finding out; they are of ſuch a perfection that no Created Being or Operation thereof can be a juſt Parallel or adequate Reſemblance of them; yet there ſeems to be ſuch an inſtance in the regiment which the Humane Soul exerciſeth in relation to the Body, that with certain correctives and exceptions may give ſome kind of Explication or Adumbration thereof, whereby though we can never get a complete <hi>Idea</hi> of the Divine Regiment, yet we may attain ſuch a notion thereof as may render it evidently credible, and in ſome kind explicable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt act of the Divine Nature relating to the World and his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64147:23"/>
adminiſtration thereof is an immanent act: The moſt wiſe counſel and purpoſe of Almighty God terminated in thoſe two great tranſeunt or emanant acts or works, the works of Creation and Providence.</p>
               <p>The Divine Counſel relating to the work of Creation, is that whereby he purpoſed to make the World, and all the ſeveral Integrals thereof, according to that moſt excellent Idea or Exemplar which he had deſigned or choſen, according to his infinite Wiſdom, in thoſe ſeveral ranks and methods, and in that order and ſtate wherein they were after created and made.</p>
               <p>The Divine Counſel relating to his Providence, or Regiment of the World, ſeems to conſiſt in theſe two things: 1. A purpoſe of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of an unceſſant influence of his power and goodneſs for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and upholding of things created, according to the ſeveral eſſential ſtates and conditions wherein they were made; ſome being created more durable, ſome leſs; ſome in one rank of being or exiſtence, ſome in another. 2. A purpoſe of inſtituting certain laws, methods, rules, and effluxes, whereby he intended to order and rule all the things he had made with the greateſt wiſdom and congruity, and according to the natures and orders wherein he had created them.</p>
               <p>And this is that which I call the law, rule, and regiment of Divine Providence, and ſeems to be of two kinds, namely, general Providence and ſpecial Providence.</p>
               <p>The general Providence I call that whereby every created Being is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ordered, according to that eſſential, connatural, implanted method, rule, and law wherein it was created. And thus the ſtate and ſeveral motions and influences of the Heavenly Bodies is that general providential law wherein they were created, and according to which they are governed; and the ſuſceptibility of thoſe influences, and the effects thereof, and of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the general providential law, whereby other phyſical Beings are governed in relation thereunto; the activity of the active Elements, and the paſſiveneſs of the paſſive, the methods and viciſſitudes of generation and corruption, the efficacy of natural cauſes, and the proper effects conſequential to them, the natural properties or affections of Bodies according to their ſeveral conſtitutions, as motion, alteration; aſcent of light, deſcent of heavy Bodies. Theſe and the like are the general providential Laws relating to them. Again, that things indued with ſenſe ſhould have a ſenſible perception, and certain inſtincts connatural to them, that rational and free Agents ſhould move rationally and freely. Theſe and infinite more are the ſtanding and ordinary Rules and Laws of general Providence, and the wiſe God, who ſees all things from the beginning to the end, and therefore can neither be diſappointed nor overſeen in any of his Counſels, hath with that great and admirable Wiſdom ſo ordered theſe Laws of his general Providence, that he thereby governs moſt excellently the World; and they are never totally changed, and but rarely altered in particular, and that only to moſt wiſe ends, and upon moſt eminent occaſions.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe the Infinite Wiſdom of God hath ſo inſtituted and modelled thoſe natural Laws, that they are <hi>ad omnem eventum</hi> fitted to the ordinary adminiſtration of the World. When the wiſeſt Counſel of Men in the World have with the greateſt care, prudence and foreſight,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64147:24"/>
made Laws, yet frequent emergencies happen which they did not, nor could foreſee, and therefore they are neceſſarily put upon repeals, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectives, and ſupplements of ſuch their Laws: But Almighty God by one moſt ſimple foreſight foreſaw all Events in Nature, and could therefore fit Laws of Nature that might be proportionate to the things he made, and not ſtand in need of any change in the ordinary adminiſtration of his Providence.</p>
               <p>The ſpecial Providence of God is ſo denominated either in relation to the objects which are ſpecial, or in relation to the acts themſelves.</p>
               <p>Special Providence in relation to the objects, is that Providence which Almighty God exerciſeth either to Man or Angels in relation to their everlaſting ends, ſuch as are Divine Laws and Inſtitutions, the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Men by Chriſt Jeſus, the Meſſage of the Goſpel, and the like.</p>
               <p>Special Providence in relation to the acts themſelves, are thoſe ſpecial actings of the Divine Power and Will, whereby He acts either in things natural or moral, not according to the Rules of general Providence, but above, or beſides, or againſt them: And theſe I call the Imperate Acts of Divine Providence; whereof in the next place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Analogal to the imperate acts of the Soul upon the Body are the imperate acts of Divine Providence, whereby with greateſt wiſdom and irreſiſtible power He doth mediately or immediately order ſome things out of the tract of ordinary Providence. For although the Divine Wiſdom hath with great ſtability ſettled the Laws of his general Providence, ſo that ordinarily or lightly they are not altered, yet it could never ſtand with the Divine Adminiſtration of the World, that He ſhould be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally mancipated to thoſe Laws he hath appointed for the ordinary admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the World. Neither is this, if it be rightly conſidered, an infringing of the Law of Nature, ſince every created Being is moſt naturally ſubject to the Soveraign Will of his Creator; therefore though He is ſometimes pleaſed by extraordinary interpoſition, and <hi>pro imperio voluntatis,</hi> to alter the ordinary method of natural or voluntary Cauſes and Effects, to interpoſe by his own immediate Power, He violates no Law of Nature, ſince it is the moſt natural thing in the World that every thing ſhould obey the Will of him that gave it being, whatever that Will be, or however manifeſted.</p>
               <p>Now the Inſtances that I ſhall give touching theſe <hi>actus imperati</hi> of Divine ſpecial Providence ſhall be, 1. In things ſimply natural: 2. In things voluntary or free Agents.</p>
               <p>In things natural we have theſe Inſtances of the <hi>actus imperati</hi> of the Divine Providence, namely, firſt thoſe that are real and alſo appearing Miracles, as <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod turned into a Serpent, our Saviours miraculous curing of all ſorts of Diſeaſes, and raiſing the Dead, and the like: Again, there are other things, that though they are natural effects, and not in themſelves apparently miraculous, yet are in truth the <hi>actus imperati</hi> of the Divine Providence, Winds and Storms, Hail and Thunder, and many the like, are things that are in themſelves natural, yet when they are in ſuch a ſeaſon and ſuch a juncture, they may be and are, and poſſibly more often than we are aware, <hi>actus imperati ſpecialis providentiae:</hi> The Eaſt Wind that brought the Locuſts, and the Weſt Wind that carried them off from <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 10.13, 19. The Eaſt Wind that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64147:24"/>
divided the <hi>Red Sea, Exod.</hi> 14.21. The Hail that ſlew the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> Kings, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.12. The Rain and Drought, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.7. Thunder and Lightning, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.18. Yea the very Blaſting, and Mildew, and Caterpiller, and Palmer-worm, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.9. are ſent by God. The ravenouſneſs of a Lion or Bear are natural to them, yet the miſſion of them upon an extraordinary occaſion may be an <hi>actus imperatus</hi> of Divine Providence, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.24. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.24. And although we often attribute as well miſchiefs as deliverances to accidental natural Cauſes, yet many times they are <hi>actus imperati</hi> of the Divine ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as much and as really and truly as the motion of my Pen is the <hi>actus imperatus</hi> of my Will at this time.</p>
               <p>And if we enquire how theſe things are effected, though it may be they be ſometimes effected by the immediate <hi>Fiat</hi> of the Divine Will, yet I have juſt reaſon to think they are moſt ordinarily done by the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Angels, as the deſtruction of the Hoſt of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and divers other great Exertions of theſe imperate acts of Divine Providence. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>His Angels that excel in ſtrength, that do his commandements, heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the voice of his word.</hi> That as the more refined and efficacious Matter, which we by way of analogy call Spirits, are the executive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the <hi>actus imperati</hi> of our Will, ſo theſe true and eſſential Spirits are ordinarily the immediate Inſtruments of the imperate acts of Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>And therefore although many times Effects purely natural, that have their Originals meerly by the ordinary courſe of Providence, are ordered by ſpecial Providence unto great and wonderful Events, yet it ſeems to me very plain, that there be many natural productions that it may be in the immediate Cauſe, or ſecond, or third, may be purely natural, yet at the fartheſt end of the Chain there is an Agent that is not ſimply natural (as we uſe to call natural Cauſes) but voluntary, ſometimes in the firſt production, ſometimes in the reſtriction, ſometimes in the direction of them, for otherwiſe we muſt of neceſſity make all ſucceſſes in the World purely natural and neceſſary, and Almighty God would be mancipated to the Fatality of Cauſes, and to that Natural Law which he gave at firſt, and Prayers and Invocation upon Him in caſe of any cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity would be unuſeful and ineffectual.</p>
               <p>And therefore though Almighty God do not create a Wind for every emergent occaſion, but the Wind is a Vapour breaking out of the Earth, yet the Miniſtration of an Angel may reſtrain, open, excite, direct or guide that Vapour to the fulfilling of thoſe imperate acts of Divine ſpecial Regiment. And it is obſervable, that although the regular part of Nature is ſeldom varied, but ordinarily keeps its conſtant tract, as the Motions of the Heavenly Bodies, yet the Meteors, as the Winds, Rain, Snow, Thunder, Exhalations, and the like, which are in themſelves more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and leſs mancipated to ſtated and regular motions, are oftentimes employed in the World to very various ends, and in very various methods of the ſpecial Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>And hence the Winds and Storms are ſtiled in a peculiar manner, <hi>Winds and ſtorms fulfilling his will, Pſal.</hi> 148. And, <hi>He bringeth his winds out of his treaſury, Pſal.</hi> 134. And again, <hi>Hath the rain a Father, and who begot the drops of dew? Job</hi> 38.28. And again, <hi>Can any of the vanities of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64147:25"/>
Gentiles give rain? Jer.</hi> 14.22. Thus the wiſe God, who doth nothing vainly or unneceſſarily, nor infringeth the more conſtant Laws of Nature, when thoſe parts thereof that are more anomalous, and more eaſily appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to his imperate acts and ends of Providence may ſerve, more ordinarily chuſeth thoſe parts of Nature to execute his ſpecial Providences, that may do it without any great fracture of the more ſtable and fixed parts of Nature, or the infringment of the Laws thereof.</p>
               <p>Again, as the Empire of the Divine Will doth exerciſe its imperate acts in the Methods of ſpecial Providence upon things ſimply in themſelves natural, ſo it doth upon Agents or Natures intellectual and free: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times immediately by Himſelf, ſometimes by the Inſtrumentality of Angels or propoſed Objects.</p>
               <p>This Exerciſe of the imperate Acts of the Divine Providence may be upon the Underſtanding or Will.</p>
               <p>Upon the Underſtanding principally theſe ways, 1. By <hi>immediate afflatus,</hi> or impreſſion, as anciently was uſual in prophetick Inſpirations. 2. By conviction of ſome Truths, and this may be either by a ſtrong and over-bearing preſenting of them to the Underſtanding with that light and evidence, that it is under a kind of neceſſity of believing them, which was often ſeen in the primitive times of Chriſtianity, wherein God was pleaſed many times irreſiſtibly, and by immediate overpowering the Underſtanding by the powerful impreſſion of the Object or Truth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, to conquer as it were the Underſtanding into an aſſent. Or, 2. By advancing and enlightning the underſtanding Faculty with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added light and perception, whereby it was enabled to diſcern the truth of things delivered: For as the Underſtanding receives ſome Truths propoſed by reaſon of the congruity between the Faculty and the Object, as the Eye ſees ſome viſible Objects by reaſon of the congruity between it and them; ſo the reaſon why it perceives not all Objects of Truth is becauſe of ſome defect of the Faculty, whereby it holds not a full and perfect congruity with them, either by reaſon of the remoteneſs or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of the Object, or ſome deficiency of light in the Faculty, which is aided by the <hi>Collyrium</hi> of the Divine Aſſiſtance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. Or elſe, 3. By ſome extraordinary concomitant moral evidence; ſuch was that of the Miracles of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, the Seals and Credentials of the Truths they delivered: And as thus the imperate acts of the Divine ſpecial Providence are exerciſed upon the Underſtanding, ſo they are exerciſed upon the Will, and that either immediately or mediately.</p>
               <p>Immediately, 1. By an immediate determining of the Will: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Will be naturally free, yet it is naturally and eſſentially ſubject to the <hi>imperium divinae voluntatis,</hi> when He is pleaſed to exerciſe that empire upon it: This although he rarely doth, yet he may do it, and ſometimes doth it irreſiſtibly, determining the Will to chuſe this or that good, and yet this without any ſuch force or violence as is ſimply contrary to the nature of it; becauſe as there is no Power in the World but owes moſt naturally an obediential ſubjection to the Lord of Nature, ſo even the Will it ſelf is naturally and eſſentially ſubject to the determination of the Lord and Author of it. 2. By immediate inclining and inflecting it to determin of it ſelf: This is that ſecret ſtriving of the Spirit of God with the Will, inflecting and perſwading it to this or that good: It differs from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64147:25"/>
the former way becauſe that it is irreſiſtible, this though potent yet in its own nature reſiſtible by the Will of Man, though it many times prevails by its efficacy. <hi>V. Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30.</p>
               <p>Again, 2. Sometimes it is done Mediately <hi>more humano,</hi> and yet not without the mediate ſpecial Empire and Regiment of the Divine Will: and thus it is done two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. By an irreſiſtible, or at leaſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conviction of the Underſtanding that the thing in propoſal is fit and neceſſary to be done or omitted; for although ſome think that the Will hath a power of chooſing or refuſing or ſuſpending, notwithſtanding the final deciſion of the practical Underſtanding, yet certain we are that ordinarily and when the Will acts as a Rational faculty, it is or ought to be determined by the laſt deciſion of the practical Underſtanding; and 2. By propoſing Moral objects that do <hi>more humano</hi> guide the Will to determine it ſelf accordingly; and theſe are various, ſometimes Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, Perſwaſion, or Examples of others, and ſometimes even the junctures of Natural occurrences. For, as I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew, and is partly touched before, even the Natural occurrences of things are under the guidance and conduct of the Divine Providence, even when to us they ſeem to be either Accidental, or to be the meer product of Natural Cauſes.</p>
               <p>And ſurely if we ſhould deny the intervention of Imperate Acts of Divine Providence in relation to actions Natural or Moral that appear in the World, we ſhould exclude his Regiment of the World in a great meaſure, and chain up all things to a fatal neceſſity of Second Cauſes, and allow at moſt to the glorious God a bare proſpect or preſcience of things that are or ſhall be done, without any other Regency of things but meerly according to the inſtituted nature and operations of things. And thus far of the Imperate Acts of the Divine Providence. Only this farther I muſt ſubjoyn as a certain truth, That neither the Empire of the Divine Providence, or his mediate or immediate determinations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions or inflexions of the Underſtanding or Will of Rational Creatures doth either naturally, morally, or intentionally deceive the Underſtanding, or pervert the Will, or neceſſitate or incline either to any falſhood or moral evil.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Analogy that is between the regiment of the Soul over the Body and the Divine regiment of the Univerſe, is in relation to the acts of general Providence, or that ordinary Law wherein Almighty God governs ordinarily the Univerſe and the things in it, without the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mixture of thoſe that I have called the Imperate Acts of ſpecial Providence, which ſeems to conſiſt of two parts: 1. The inſtitution of certain common Laws or Rules for all created Beings, which (without a ſpecial intervention of his Will to alter or change) they ſhould regularly obſerve; as that the Heavenly Bodies ſhould have ſuch Motions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, that the Inferiour or Elementary World ſhould have its ſeveral Mixtures and Tranſmutations by the application of the active principles and particles in it to Paſſives, and by the virtue of the Heavenly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Influences: That there ſhould be viciſſitudes of generations and corruptions; that Vegetables ſhould have the operation of vital vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, increaſe, duration and productions according to their ſeveral kinds; that Senſible Natures ſhould enjoy a life of Senſe, and thoſe ſeveral
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64147:26"/>
powers or faculties of Senſation, Phantaſie, Memory, Appetition, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, Local Motion, Generation, and thoſe ſeveral inſtincts whereby they ſhould be managed and governed according to the conveniencies of a ſenſitive nature: That the Rational Nature ſhould have thoſe Faculties of a Senſitive Nature, and ſuperadded to it the Faculties of Intellect, Reaſon and Will, whereby it might govern it ſelf as a reaſonable free Agent, and determine it ſelf to this or that action. And theſe are the inſtituted Laws of the Divine common Providence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A continued influx of the Divine Goodneſs, whereby things are upheld and continued in their ſtate of being according to this Law of their Creation: And by virtue of both theſe acts of common divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence all things are enabled to act and operate according to the Laws of their being, without the neceſſity of any new individual concurrent act of ſpecial Providence producing, directing, or determining their ſeveral operations. And hence it is that the Will of man by the inſtituted Law of his Creation, and the common Influence of the Divine goodneſs and power is enabled to act as a reaſonable Creature, to determine it ſelf, and to govern its proper actions according to the Law of his Creation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any particular, ſpecificating, concurrent, new imperate act of the Divine ſpecial Providence to every particular determination of his Will: Even as the continued influx of the reaſonable Soul enables thoſe Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which we call Natural or Involuntary, without new deliberation, purpoſe or counſel to every new act thereof: And by this means the World is in an ordinary courſe of Providence governed according to thoſe ſtanding fixed Laws given to the Univerſe and the ſeveral parts thereof by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, wherein it is ſupported by the common influx and preſence of the Divine power and goodneſs.</p>
               <p>And this is that which being duly conſidered extricateth that Queſtion which hath ſo much troubled the World, concerning the ſinful acts of men, and how far forth the glorious God is at all concerned in them. Certainly the imperate acts of his Bleſſed Will have nothing to do to enforce or neceſſitate the Will of man to any ſin, it is far from the purity of his Glorious Nature: But the general Law of his Providence is only thus far concerned in it, That he hath made Man an intelligent and free Agent, put him into the power of his own Will, but yet <hi>ſub graviore imperio,</hi> to reſtrain its actings, if he pleaſe, by his ſpecial Providence; and Man in this ſtate of his liberty, when he doth ſin, ſins from the Empire of his own Will, and not from a determination of the Divine Regiment.</p>
               <p>But though the contemplation of the regiment of the Soul over the Body hath given ſome analogical explication of the Divine Providence in the Government of the World, yet as this Analogy is but imperfect, the Divine Regiment of the World is infinitely more wiſe, more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, more perfect than the regiment of the Soul over the Body, ſo in many things this Analogy by no means holds: For inſtance, The Soul doth what it doth in the Body, though by a kind of efficiency, yet it is but a ſubordinate efficient, and vicarious and inſtrumental in the hands of the Almighty; who as it hath endued the Soul with this energy, ſo the Soul is but his ſubſtitute in this regiment of the Body; but Almighty God is the ſupreme Rector of the World, and of all thoſe ſubordinate
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64147:26"/>
provinces and parts thereof: Secondly, in the imperate acts of the Souls regency of the Body and the <hi>Compoſitum:</hi> She cannot in the Body work immediately without the inſtrumentality of the intermediate animal and vital Spirits: But in the imperate acts of the ſpecial Divine Providence though we may juſtly think he doth moſt ordinarily uſe the miniſtry of thoſe noble natures called Angels, yet he may and oftentimes doth by the immediate <hi>Fiat</hi> of his own Will exerciſe theſe imperate acts of ſpecial Providence; for his Power is infinite, and all Beings are in an immediate obedience and ſubjection to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul cannot by its own Will exerciſe any immediate imperate act upon thoſe natural and involuntary operations which yet are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by an influx from it; indeed it may ſtarve and deſtroy the Body by its Empire, and thereby conſequently impede and determine thoſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and involuntary operations, yet it cannot by its Intention or Empire prohibit or ſuſpend their exerciſe, the natural means being allowed and preſent; it cannot effectually prohibit the Heart not to move, or the Blood not to circulate, or the Ventricle not to digeſt: But it is otherwiſe with the Regent and regiment of the World; even thoſe things wherein he hath ſet a fixed Law, which by virtue of the common influence of the Divine Power and Goodneſs they obſerve and follow, are ſubject to the Empire of his ſpecial Providence and the imperate acts thereof. And this is evident in that Adminiſtration of ſpecial Providence which is miraculous; he commanded the Fire not to burn, ſtopped the mouths and appetites of Lions, and prohibited the natural operation and agency of Natural Cauſes. 2. In all the ſpecial Providences that are exerciſed in the World, though they do not viſibly appear to us to be miraculous, yet they moſt certainly are governed by the <hi>imperium</hi> of ſpecial Divine Providence, whereby it ſometimes excites ſecond Cauſes to production of Effects which being thus excited they naturally produce; ſometimes impeding them, ſometimes diverting them, ſometimes directing them, ſometimes by contemperation, or uniting other more active or contrary Cauſes allaying or enforcing them: and although it may be the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Divine <hi>imperium</hi> or ſpecial Providence be not immediately the immediate antecedent Cauſe, but it may be the third, the fourth, the tenth, the twentieth Cauſe diſtant from the Effect. Nay though poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the conjunction of the immediate <hi>imperium Providentiae</hi> be with the Firſt Mover in Nature, the Heavenly, Aethereal, or Fiery Influx, yet the regiment of the Divine Providence is as full and infallible in relation to the imperate regiment of the Effect, as if it were immediately joyned to the deſigned Effect: So that the Moral of that Poetical fiction, that the uppermoſt Link of all the <hi>ſeries</hi> of ſubordinate Cauſes is faſtned to <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Chair, ſignifies a uſeful truth; Almighty God doth as powerfully govern and direct when he pleaſeth, and how he pleaſeth, all ſubordinate Cauſes and Effects, as the Soul governs the motion of the Muſcle or Limb by thoſe ſtrings of the Nerve which are rooted in the Brain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, the regiment of the Soul over the Body is the regiment of the more active part over the more paſſive, though both making one <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum;</hi> but the regiment of Almighty God over the World is not as a part of it, or as a Form or Soul informing it, but as a Rector or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, diſtinct, ſeparate, and eſſentially differing from it, his regiment
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64147:27"/>
of the World in this reſpect not ſo much reſembling the regiment of the Soul over the Body, which together with it make one compounded Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as the regiment of the Maſter or Rector over the Ship, or the regiment of a King over his Subjects.</p>
               <p>And thus I have gone through the Speculative conſideration of the Divine Providence reſulting from the contemplation of a Souls regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body, wherein I have been the longer, becauſe the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Divine Providence is a Subject that delights me, and I am contented to dwell upon it as much as I may, and to take up this or any the like occaſion to lead me to the contemplation of it.</p>
               <p>And thus far touching the Uſefulneſs of the Contemplation of the Humane Nature, in relation to truths Speculative.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Uſefulneſs of it in relation to matters Practical, wherein I ſhall be ſhorter. This Contemplation hath theſe uſeful Advantages, namely, 1. <hi>Phyſical;</hi> 2. <hi>Moral;</hi> 3. <hi>Theological</hi> or <hi>Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Phyſical,</hi> by which I mean that practical part of Phyſical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is called Medicinal. The due conſideration and knowledge of the ſtructure, fabrick and parts of the Humane Body is neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to that excellent Faculty for the preſervation of life and health, no one thing being more conducible to the advance and perfection of that Science or Faculty than the knowledge of the Humane Body, wherein the Experience of Anatomy and diſſection, and the Obſervations of the ancient and modern Phyſicians hath given a large evidence and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Moral</hi> Practical conſequences deducible from the knowledge of the Humane nature are many and uſeful. For inſtance, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the admirable Frame of the Humane Nature, made by the Wiſdom, and according to the Image of the Glorious God, 1. How careful ſhould it make me that I do not injure that goodly Structure in others, by offering violence to the life of another, or to corrupt him either by evil example or evil counſels? 2. How careful ſhould it make me in relation to my ſelf, not to embaſe that excellent Frame either of my Body or Soul, or both, into the image of a Brute by ſenſuality, luxury, or intemperance; or into the image of a Devil, by malice, envy, or irreligion? How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhould it make me to improve and ennoble thoſe excellent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive faculties of my Underſtanding and Will with ſuch Objects as are worthy to be known and deſired? The intellectual Faculty is a goodly field, capable of great improvement, and it is the worſt husbandry in the world to ſow it with trifles or impertinencies, or to let it lye fallow without any ſeed at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Theological</hi> uſes that ariſe from the knowledge of our ſelves are great and many. When I conſider the admirable Frame of my Body, made up in that elegant, ſtately, and uſeful compoſure; and when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the uſefulneſs, amplitude, and nobleneſs of my Faculties, an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding capable of the knowledge of all things neceſſary for me to know, accommodate and fitted to the perception and intellection (though not to the full comprehenſion) of a World full of variety and excellency; of a God full of all conceivable perfection and goodneſs; a Memory able to retain the notions of what I underſtand; a Will endued with freedom, whereby I am a ſubordinate Lord of all my actions, and endued with a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64147:27"/>
connatural propenſion and appetite unto rational good; Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to guide and direct me in all the enquiries and actions of my life; and beſides all this, a Soul, the ſtock and root of all thoſe Faculties, endued with immortality, and capable of everlaſting bleſſedneſs: When I conſider that this Soul of mine is not only endued with faculties admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably fitted to the life of Senſe which I enjoy in this World, but find in it certain ſecret connatural rudiments of goodneſs and virtue, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural deſire and endeavour after a ſtate of immortal happineſs. And when I conſider that this Frame both of Body and Soul had its primitive origination immediately from the great Creator of all things; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my own immediate origination was from my Parents, yet that very productive virtue was implanted in the primitive Nature by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and the derivation of the ſame ſpecifical Nature to me was by virtue of his original Inſtitution and Benediction, and by virtue thereof that excellency and perfection of Humane Nature in its eſſential which was firſt formed by the glorious God, is handed over to me, abating only thoſe decays which Sin brought into my nature: I ſay, when I deeply and intimately conſider theſe things, I cannot but be ſenſible that that Being from whom I thus derive this being, and ſuch a being, is a moſt wiſe, powerful and bountiful Being, that could thus frame the Humane Nature, and thus freely beſtow and confer this conſtitution upon me. 2. And upon this ſenſe of his Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs, I muſt needs entertain it with all imaginable admiration of it, and with all poſſible gratitude, for ſo great and ſo free a gift. 3. And conſequently I cannot chooſe but exerciſe the choiceſt affections I have towards him, of reverence and fear of his Greatneſs and Majeſty, of dependance and reſt upon his Power and Goodneſs, of love to the excellency of his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Perfection and Communicative Goodneſs and Beneficence. 4. And conſequently of entire ſubjection unto him that upon all the rights ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable hath the moſt juſt ſovereignty over me. 5. And conſequently of all due inquiſitiveneſs what is the Will and good pleaſure of that God that I owe ſo much gratitude, love and ſubjection to, that I may ſerve and pleaſe him. 6. A reſolved, entire, hearty obedience of that Will of his in all things; thereby to teſtifie to him my love, gratitude, and ſubjection. 7. An external manifeſtation to Men and Angels of that internal love and gratitude I owe him by continual praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to him, invocation of him, reverence of him, and all thoſe acts of Religion, Duty and Obedience which are the natural Proceed of that internal frame of my Soul towards him. 8. A conſtant deſire of my Soul to enjoy as much of this bountiful glorious bleſſed Being, as it is poſſible for my nature to be capable of. 9. And becauſe my eſtate and condition in this life is but a ſtate of mortality, and a temporal life; an earneſt endeavour to have my everlaſting Soul fitted and qualified to be an everlaſting partaker of his preſence and goodneſs in a ſtate of nearer union to him and fruition of him, in that future life of glory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. 10. And conſequently abundance of circumſpection, care and vigilance that I ſo behave my ſelf in this ſtate of probation here, that I neither loſe his favour from whom I expect this happineſs, nor render my ſelf unworthy, unfit, or uncapable to enjoy it.</p>
               <p>And thus this deep, ſerious, and comprehenſive Conſideration of our
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64147:28"/>
ſelves and the Humane Nature in its juſt latitude, doth not run out barely into Notions and Speculations, but is operative and practical; teacheth a man Virtue and Goodneſs and Religion and Piety, as well as Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and is operative to make a man ſuch as it teacheth him to be; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects his nature, enricheth it with practical as well as ſpeculative habits, and fits and moulds and accommodates a man to a conformity to the End of his being.</p>
               <p>And theſe be the Reaſons that have eſpecially put me upon the ſearch and enquiry into this Subject, MAN.</p>
               <p>I am not without excellent helps and patterns in this Inquiry, nor without the due fruits and effects that it hath had upon the Minds of them that have been exerciſed in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen,</hi> though he ſpoke darkly and doubtfully of the Soul, being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of much of that light which we now have, yet upon the bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the ſtructure of the Body and the parts thereof, in that excellent Book of his <hi>De Uſu Partium,</hi> reſolves the whole Oeconomy thereof into the Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Efficiency of the Glorious God; and is tranſported both with the admiration of the Divine Wiſdom appearing therein, and with indignation againſt the perverſneſs and ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his diſciples, which would attribute this one <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi> to Chance.</p>
               <p>And had he, or ſhould any elſe apply himſelf to the ſearch of that Intellectual Principle in Man, his Soul, he will find a greater evidence of the Divine Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Power; as will eaſily appear in a little conſideration thereof.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CAP. II.</hi> Touching the Excellency of the Humane Nature in general.</head>
               <p>ALthough I intend a more diſtinct Conſideration of the Humane Nature, and the Faculties of the Humane Soul, and the Parts of the Humane Body, yet it may be neceſſary before we come to the diſcuſſion of the origination of Mankind, to premiſe ſomething concerning the Nature of Mankind, and its preheminence and excellence above all other ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Creatures, that we may have a little taſt touching that Being whoſe origination we inquire. This Conſideration will be of uſe to us in the enquiry touching the origination of Man; to evidence, that neither Chance nor ſurd or inanimate Nature could be the Efficient of ſuch a Being, but a moſt Wiſe, Powerful, and Excellent Author thereof.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not at large diſcuſs thoſe Faculties and Organs which he hath in common with Vegetables and Brutes, but thoſe only that belong to him ſpecifically as Man, and thoſe alſo but briefly.</p>
               <p>The Corporeal Beings of this lower World are divided into theſe two ranks or kinds; ſuch as are Inanimate or not living, and ſuch as are Animate or living.</p>
               <p>Life, according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in 1. <hi>De Anima, cap.</hi> 1. is deſcribed by its
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64147:28"/>
effects, <hi>viz. Nutritio, &amp; auctio, &amp; diminutio quae per ſeipſum fit;</hi> and the loweſt rank of ſuch things as have life are Vegetables: for though Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals have a kind of analogical nutrition and augmentation, yet it is ſuch as ordinarily <hi>non fit per ſeipſa,</hi> but rather by acceſſion and digeſtion from external Principles and coagmentation.</p>
               <p>The Principle from whence this Life flows in all Corporeal Natures that have it, is that which they call <hi>Anima,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>vis Animaſtica.</hi> The Faculties or Operations of this <hi>Anima vegetabilis</hi> are theſe; 1. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractio alimenti:</hi> 2. <hi>Fermentatio &amp; aſſimilatio nutrimenti ſic attracti in ſuccum ſibi congenerem:</hi> 3. <hi>Digeſtio, vel diſperſio alimenti ſic aſſimilati in diverſas partes individui vegetabilis:</hi> 4. <hi>Augmentatio individui vegetabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, ex unione &amp; conſolidatione ſucci vegetabilis diverſis partibus individui.</hi> 5. <hi>Conformatio hujuſmodi particularum unitarum ſpecificae naturae ejuſdem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividui cujus est augmentatio; ut in trunco, ramis, cortice, fibris, foliis, fructu,</hi> &amp;c. 6. <hi>Seminificatio &amp; propagatio ex ſemine vel partibus ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus.</hi> 1. Attraction of aliment: 2. Fermentation and aſſimilation of the nouriſhment ſo attracted, into a juice of the ſame kind with it ſelf: 3. Digeſtion, or diſperſion of the aliment ſo aſſimilated into the divers parts of the vegetable individual: 4. Augmentation of the vegetable individual, from the union and conſolidation of the vegetable juice to the divers parts of the individual: 5. The conformation of theſe united particles, to the ſpecifical nature of the ſame Individual, which is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; as in the trunk of a Tree, the bark, fibres, leaves, and fruit: 6. Seminification and propagation from the ſeed or ſeminal parts. Theſe ſeem to be the proceſs of the Vegetable Nature, Soul, and Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next rank of living Creatures is that which hath not only a vegetable life, and a vegetable principle of life, but hath alſo ſuperadded a life of ſenſe, and a ſenſitive Soul or Principle of that life of Senſe, which nevertheleſs as one ſpecifical Principle exerts the acts as well of the vegetable as ſenſitive life.</p>
               <p>And this nature 1. Includes all thoſe powers and faculties of the Vegetable Nature, as Attraction, Aſſimilation, Digeſtion, Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Conformation, and Propagation or Seminification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It includes them in a far more curious, elegant, and perfect manner, at leaſt in the more perfect Animals. As for inſtance, the firſt aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the attracted nouriſhment in Vegetables converts it into a watry humor or juice; but the aſſimilation thereof in Animals rectifies this alimental juice into Chyle, and then into Blood: The propagation of Vegetables is without diſtinction of Sexes, but that of Animals uſually with diſtinction of Sexes; and many more ſuch advances hath the animal nature above the vegetable in thoſe faculties or operations which for the main are common to both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſuperadds a greater and higher perfection to the animal nature, by communicating to it certain eſſential Faculties and Powers that the vegetable nature hath not: And thoſe are theſe;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Senſe. It is true, that <hi>Campanella</hi> in his Book <hi>De Senfu rerum,</hi> and ſome others that have written <hi>de Perceptione ſubſtantiae,</hi> attribute a kind of Senſe to all created Beings, and therefore much more to thoſe that have a vegetable life: And in ſome Vegetables we ſee ſomething that carries a kind of analogy to Senſe; they contract their leaves againſt the cold,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64147:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they open them to the favourable heat; they provide teguments for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their ſeeds againſt the injury of the weather, as their <hi>cortices,</hi> ſhells; and membranes; they ſeem to be carried with a complacency in the propagation of their kinds as well as Brutes, and therefore many of them being impeded therein, they germinate again, though later in the year: And ſome Plants ſeem to have the ſenſe of Touch, as in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Plant and ſome others; which ſeems to be an advance of the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Nature to the very confines, or a kind of contiguity to the loweſt degree of thoſe Animals that are reckoned in the rank of Senſibles.</p>
               <p>But this notwithſtanding we deny a real and true ſenſe to Vegetables; indeed, they have a kind of <hi>umbra Senſus,</hi> a ſhadow of Senſe, as we ſhall hereafter obſerve, that Senſibles have a kind of <hi>umbra Rationis,</hi> a ſhadow of Reaſon, but it is only a ſhadow thereof. 2. There are alſo in their natures by the wiſe God of Nature implanted even in their vegetable natures certain paſſive Strictures or Signatures of that Wiſdom which hath made and ordered all things with the higheſt reaſon, even the leaſt inconſiderable Herb; and theſe Signatures are bound to their natures by certain connatural inſtincts planted in them; but ſtill they want the active principle of Senſe in them.</p>
               <p>Now this Senſe or Senſitive Faculty in Animals is of two kinds; the external Senſes, and the internal. The external Senſes are five, all which belong to the more perfect Animals; and that of the Soul to all Animals, <hi>viz.</hi> Seeing, Heiring, Taſting, Smelling, and Touching.</p>
               <p>And it is admirable to conſider that the great Lord of Nature hath ſo diſpoſed of ſenſible Beings, that although (for ought we know) there may be many more impreſſions or motions of external Bodies that we know not by their communication unto Senſe, becauſe we have not Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties receptive of them. Yet the Faculties of the five Senſes are ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate and proportioned to all thoſe impreſſions of Objects from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that are conducible to the uſe and well-being of Animals in a ſenſible ſtation or nature.</p>
               <p>The internal Senſes are of two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Such as concern per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Objects: 2. Such as concern the motion to them as uſeful, or from them as noxious.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the firſt ſort have ſome adumbration of the Rational Nature, as Vegetables have of the Senſible, and they ſeem to be theſe; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, the Phantaſie, the Eſtimative Faculty, and the Memory.</p>
               <p>The Common Senſe, or <hi>Commune Senſorium,</hi> which receives the ſeveral reports of the ſeveral Senſes by their ſeveral Nerves into that common receptacle or ſeat of this uſeful office, the Brain; where it diſtinguiſheth the Objects of the ſeveral Senſories.</p>
               <p>The Phantaſie, that in a way unſearchable unto us, 1. Creates the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>Images of the things delivered from the ſeveral Senſes to the <hi>Commune Senſorium:</hi> 2. Compounds thoſe Images into ſome things not unlike Propoſitions, though confuſedly and indiſtinctly: 3. Makes particular applications of them one to another, though ſtill darkly and confuſedly, whereby it excites the Appetite either to proſecute their attainment, or fly from them.</p>
               <p>The Eſtimative Faculty, which is indeed no other than the laſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or compoſition of the Phantaſie before-mentioned, whereby it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64147:29"/>
concludes that this is a ſenſible good or a ſenſible evil, that it is attainable or feaſible, or not attainable; that though it be good, yet ſometimes it is not ſafe to be attempted by reaſon of the impendence of a greater ſenſible evil. This ſeems to be the dark and confuſed ſhadow of the deciſion of the practical Intellect in Man.</p>
               <p>The Memory, which is an impreſſion of the Image of ſome ſenſible Object made by the Phantaſie, which remains ſome time after, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and by the return of a like Objedt again is ſometimes revived and reinforced: But how this Image is made, where it is imprinted, how conſerved, are things we cannot at all attain the knowledge of; they are wonderfull, though common effects of a moſt wiſe and ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Wiſdom and Power that hath thus conſtituted even the Faculties of the Animal Nature: Only it ſeems to me that theſe Images are not made in the Brain it ſelf, as the Pencil of a Painter or Engraver makes the Image in the Table or Metal, but are imprinted in a wonderfull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in the very Soul it ſelf: For it is plain that Sounds and Voices are remembred, and yet no real configurations are poſſible to be made thereof in the Brain; for what Image can there be of a Sound?</p>
               <p>Now as to that Faculty or thoſe Faculties that concern the purſuit or flight of what is thus propounded by the Phantaſie or Eſtimative Faculty, they are generally two: The <hi>Appetitus naturalis,</hi> which bears ſome analogy to the Will in the Reaſonable Nature; and the acts thereof are either proſecution of the Senſible Object propounded, if preſented by the Phantaſie and Eſtimative Faculty as good; or elſe averſation from it, if preſented as evil.</p>
               <p>This is the Faculty of Empire or Command, for in conformity to the determination of the Appetite the motion of the Body follows.</p>
               <p>The other Faculties that concern purſuit or averſation, are the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the <hi>Satellites appetitus,</hi> ſerving either in the proſecution of the good propounded, as Love, Deſire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in oppoſition of the evil preſented, as Anger, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus far touching the Senſes in Animals, both External and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſuperadded prelation of the ſenſible nature above the vegetable is the faculty and exerciſe of animal and local motion, whereas Vegetables have naturally no other motion but that which is determined and natural, and what is within it ſelf; as the motion of Attraction, Digeſtion, Nouriſhment, Augmentation and Increaſe. Animals have the faculty and power of animal motion; which hath theſe acceſſions, 1. It is or may be ſpontaneous; for though the object moves objectively, yet the faculty or power moves <hi>ab intrinſeco,</hi> and ſpontaneouſly. 2. It moves the parts ſpontaneouſly, the Leg, the Eye, the Ear or any other part, which cannot be done by Vegetables. 3. Again, it can move the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> from one <hi>ubi</hi> to another (at leaſt in all Animals except thoſe that are almoſt in the nature of Plants, called <hi>Zoophyta</hi> or <hi>Plantanimali a</hi>) which cannot be done by Plants, who are mancipated and fixed to the place of their ſtation or growth, unleſs removed by an extrinſecal agent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third ſuperadded advantage of Animals is their Inſtincts. It is true, Vegetables have their inſtincts radicated in their nature, as we
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64147:30"/>
have before obſerved; yea even things Inanimate have certain ſimple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts, as in the motions of aſcent of light bodies, and deſcent of heavy bodies: But the inſtincts of Animals are ſenſible inſtincts of a more noble kind and nature than thoſe of Vegetables, and ſuch as ſeem to ſavour more of an active principle; as ſagacity of Brutes in taking their prey, defending themſelves, providing againſt the inclemency of the weather, care for their young, building their neſts, and infinite more, which are too long to name.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſuperadded Faculties of the Animal Nature; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate and accommodate to their faculties are their organizations of their Bodies. And in as much as there is great varieties in the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diſpoſitions, faculties and uſes of ſeveral Animals of ſeveral kinds, their organizations are not only fitted to the common natures, uſes and powers of ſenſible Creatures, but every ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> hath its ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation as well of his Organs as of his Faculties to the exigence, uſe and convenience of his proper ſpecifical nature.</p>
               <p>Thus the ranks of the vegetable perfections are not only included within the rank of ſenſible Beings, but theſe have greater perfections in what is common to both, and ſuperadditions of other more noble Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Organs not communicable to the former. The Vegetable Nature is indeed like a curious Engin, but it hath but ſome ſimple and ſingle motions, like a Watch that gives the hour of the day, or a <hi>Trochea</hi> with one Wheel: But the Animal Nature is like an Engin that hath a greater compoſition of Wheels, and more variety of motions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; as one of the compound Engins of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> or as a Watch, that beſides the hour of the day gives the day of the month, the age of the Moon, the place of the Sun in the Zodiack, and other curious Motions wrought by multiplication of Wheels.</p>
               <p>Now touching the Senſitive Natures, there have been two extreme opinions, both of them extremely contrary one to another, and yet both of them, as they are delivered by their Authors, untrue.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Opinion that depreſſeth the natures of ſenſible Creatures below their juſt value and eſtimate, rendring them no more but barely Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſms or Artificial Engins; ſuch as were <hi>Archytas</hi> his Dove, <hi>Regiomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> his wooden Eagle, or <hi>Walchius</hi> his iron Spider: that they have no vital Principle of all their various Motions but the meer modifications of Matter, or at leaſt the elementary Fire mingled with their other Matter; that they have no other form or internal principle of Life, Motion, or Senſe but that which is relative and reſults from the diſpoſition, texture, orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization and compoſition of their ſeveral Limbs, Members or Organs: This fancy began by <hi>Des Cartes</hi> in his <hi>Fundamenta Phyſica,</hi> and hath been followed and improved by ſome of his admirers, and particularly much favoured by <hi>Honoratus Faber</hi> in his Book <hi>De Generatione Animalium;</hi> and herein they think they have given a fair ſolution to all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Senſitive Nature, and given a fair prelation to the Soul of Man, which they agree to be a ſubſtantial Principle of humane actions: But in both theſe they have been diſappointed; for this ſuppoſition as it gives not at all a tolerable explication of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of ſenſe and animal motions, ſo if it did, it would eaſily adminiſter to a little more confidence and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a temptation to reſolve all the Motions of the reaſonable Soul into
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64147:30"/>
the like ſuppoſition, only by advancing the Engin or <hi>Automaton huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> into a more curious and complicated conſtitution: For he that can once ſuppoſe that the various modifications of Matter and Motion, and the due organization of the Bodies of Brutes can produce the admirable operations of Senſe, Phantaſie, Memory, Appetite, and all thoſe inſtincts which we find in Brutes; is in a fair way of reſolving the operation of the Reaſonable Nature into the like ſuppoſition, only by ſuppoſing the organization of the latter ſomewhat more curiouſly and exactly diſpoſed and ordered as much above that of Brutes, as theirs is above that of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables. It is true, the organization of the humane and animal Body, with accommodation to their ſeveral functions and offices, is certainly fitted with the moſt curious and exact Mechaniſm imaginable; as appears by the ſtructure of the Heart, the Lungs, the Brain, the Tongue, the Hand, the Nerves, the Muſcles and all other parts, and the ſeveral orders and methods of their motions and adaptations to their ſeveral offices, and the exerciſe by them of thoſe Faculties to whoſe ſervice they are conſigned; This muſt needs be acknowledged by every man that obſerves them, or that takes the pains to read the Tracts of thoſe that have written of them; and eſpecially <hi>Galen</hi> his divine Book <hi>De Uſu Partium, Des Cartes</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britius</hi> concerning the ſtructure of the Eye, the ſame <hi>Fabritius</hi> and <hi>Steno De motu Muſculorum,</hi> and divers others.</p>
               <p>But that the Principle that ſets on work theſe Organs, and worketh by them, is nothing elſe but the modification of Matter, or the natural motion thereof thus or thus poſited or diſpoſed, or the bare conformation of the Organs, or the incluſion and expanſion of any natural inanimate particles of elementary Fire, is moſt apparently falſe, even to the view of any that obſerves or conſiders impartially.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to reſolve Perception, Phantaſie, Memory, the ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and inſtincts of Brutes, the ſpontaneouſneſs of many of their animal motions into thoſe Principles, nor are they explicable without ſuppoſing ſome active determinate power, force, or virtue connexed to, and inherent in their Spirits or more ſubtil parts, of a higher extraction than the bare natural modification or texture of Matter, or diſpoſition of Organs, or, as they are often pleaſed to ſtile them, their <hi>plexus partium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, it is viſible to the Eye, that that power, or virtue, or principle, whatever it is, that in the generative proceſs firſt immediately formeth and organizeth the parts of the Body, is that which guides, orders and governs all the animal motions of it after: That power which firſt forms the Brain, the Heart, the Liver, the Eye, is that which afterward increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, augmenteth, exerciſeth and employeth them after: And no man living can force himſelf to imagin that that Principle which forms, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizeth, diſpoſeth, and modifieth the parts, is any thing that reſults from the organization or modification of thoſe parts which are not yet moulded or framed, but muſt have its modification from that Principle which is antecedent to any manner of organization or texture of parts into an animal compoſition: No man therefore that hath not abjured his Reaſon, and ſworn allegiance to a preconceived fantaſtical <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> can undertake the defence of ſuch a ſuppoſition, if he have but the patience impartially to conſider and look about him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other extreme Opinion ſeems to advance the Animal Nature
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64147:31"/>
too high, at leaſt without a due allay of their general expreſſion; namely, thoſe who attribute Reaſon and a reaſoning faculty or power to Animals as well as to Men, though not altogether in the ſame degree of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: ſo that they will not have Reaſon to be the ſpecifical or conſtitutive difference of the Humane Nature, but common to them and Brutes: This Opinion ſeems generally to be favoured by the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> that held Tranſmigration of Souls; by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in <hi>Grillo,</hi> and his ſecond Oration <hi>De Eſu Carnium;</hi> by <hi>Sextus Empiricus, Contra Mathematicos;</hi> by <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Abſtinentia ab Eſu Animalium;</hi> which he endeavours to prove and illuſtrate by divers reaſons and inſtances; and among the latter by <hi>Patricius</hi> in his fifth Book <hi>de Animis irrationalibus;</hi> but above all by the ingenious and learned <hi>De Chambre</hi> in his Book of the Knowledge of Beaſts, wherein he aſſerts not only the ſimple apprehenſion of Beaſts by phantaſms or images wrought by the Phantaſie, but the conjunction of images with affirmations and negations, which make up Propoſitions, and the conjunction of Propoſitions one to another, and illation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions upon them, which is Ratiocination or Diſcourſe: And that in farther evidence thereof there is a certain kind of Language whereby Beaſts or Birds, eſpecially of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> communicate their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions one to another; only this diſcurſive Ratiocination of Brutes he calls <hi>Ratio imaginativa,</hi> and differenceth it from <hi>Ratio intellectualis</hi> which belongs properly to Men, principally in this, That the imaginative or brutal Ratiocination keeps ſtill in particulars, and within the verge of particular propoſitions and concluſions; but intellectual Reaſon hath to do with univerſals, and for the moſt part grounds and directs its Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination by them.</p>
               <p>Touching the thing called Reaſon, we muſt conſider that it hath a double acceptation: 1. It is taken for every conduct of any thing by fitting means to fitting ends, or the due and convenient ordering and adapting of one thing to another; and this again ſeems to be of three kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Active, Paſſive, or Mixt: i. That I call Active Reaſon which from an inward intellective principle orders and diſpoſeth, as the Watch-maker contrives, orders, and diſpoſeth the ſeveral parts of the Watch, ſo that it excites a regular and uſeful motion: 2. The Paſſive Reaſon (which is more properly Reaſonableneſs) is that order and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity which is impreſſed upon the thing thus wrought; as in the Watch I ſee every thing moves duly and orderly, and the reaſon of the motion of the Ballance is by the motion of the next Wheel, and that by the motion of the next, and that by the motion of the Fuſee, and that by the motion of the Spring; the whole frame, order and contexture of the Watch carries a reaſonableneſs in it, the paſſive impreſſion of the Reaſon or intellectual <hi>Idea</hi> that was in the Artiſt: 3. The Mixt ſort of Reaſon ſeems to be when a thing concurrs actively and from an internal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and (in things that have life) vitally, to the production of a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effect; but yet <hi>per modum inſtrumenti,</hi> and in the virtue of a ſuperiour direction of a reaſonable agent: Thus when I plow my ground, my Horſe is harneſſed and chained to my Plough, and put in his track or ſurrow, and guided by my Whip and my Tongue, and ſo draws on my Plough, and this reaſonable work is performed actively and vitally by my Brute in the virtue of my direction. And certainly this kind of latter Reaſon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64147:31"/>
is evident not only in the brute Beaſts in their inſtincts and operations, but alſo in Vegetables, and almoſt in all things in Nature; for they are all indued with a certain inherent activity, which is nevertheleſs implanted, directed, ordered and determined by the great Creator in the Laws of their ſeveral conſtitutions: The proceſs of nutrition and generation not only in Animals but even in Vegetables is done with the higheſt Reaſon, exceeding the imitation of the Humane Reaſon; the Birds making their Neſts, ordering their Eggs and moving them in incubation, feeding and diſciplining their young, is done with the moſt exquiſite reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity thereunto, beyond the artifice of the moſt ingenious man. And it muſt needs be ſo; for though they concur actively from an internal Principle to the production of the effect, yet they are determined therein and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and their track ordered for them and to them by the Laws of their nature inſtituted and imprinted on them by the unimitable Wiſdom of the higheſt intellectual Being. This mixed or inſtrumental Reaſon, as I may call it, therefore all muſt agree to belong not only to Brutes, but almoſt to all things in Nature, and herein differs from Reaſon or Reaſonableneſs which I before call ſimply paſſive, in that it immediately proceeds from the internal active Principles implanted by God in their natures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But there is another kind of Reaſon which we call Ratiocination, or <hi>Diſcurſus rationalis,</hi> which conſiſts principally in theſe three things, though the two former without the latter make not up a compleat Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination: 1. The ſimple apprehenſion of things themſelves, which is done by images or repreſentations thereof, made either by the Intellect, or by the repreſentations made thereunto by the Phantaſie: 2. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the images or repreſentation of things with an affirmation or negation; this makes a Propoſition: 3. The compoſition of ſeveral Propoſitions among themſelves, and drawing from them Concluſions; and this is called <hi>Syllogiſmus,</hi> Ratiocination or Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>But though this be the <hi>analyſis</hi> of Ratiocination into which by a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attention it may be reſolved, we are not to think all ſort of reaſoning or ratiocination, even in Men themſelves, is preſently by way of explicit or formed Syllogiſms, or artificial Moods and Figure. Some conſecutions are ſo intimately and evidently connexed to or found in the premiſſes, that the concluſion is attained <hi>quaſi per ſaltum,</hi> and without any thing of ratiocinative proceſs, and as the Eye ſees his object immediately and without any previous diſcourſe; ſo in objects intellectual many evident truths or principles are <hi>primo intuitu</hi> aſſented unto: as in objects of Senſe the action is elicited <hi>per ſaltum;</hi> as many times when a Horſe is hungry and comes to a good paſture, he falls to his food immediately without forming Mr. <hi>Chambre</hi>'s Syllogiſm,
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>This green is graſs,</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>This graſs is good to eat,</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Therefore this green is good to eat.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
But the <hi>tranſitus</hi> from the Senſe to the Phantaſie, and from that to the Appetite, and from that to the motion of Eating is immediate, momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous, and <hi>per ſaltum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:64147:32"/>In brief, as the vegetable nature, as hath been obſerved, hath a kind of ſhadow of the ſenſible nature, ſo the ſenſitive nature hath a kind of ſhadow of the truly rational nature; their Reaſon is but a low, obſcure and imperfect ſhadow thereof, as the Water-gall is of the Rain-bow; and proportionable to their imaginative Reaſon is their animal Language, which though it be a kind of natural ſign of their Imagination and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet it is infinitely below the perfection of humane Language: For we ſee that thoſe Birds who by reaſon of the analogy of their organs by uſe are taught ſome words or ſentences, yet they never proportion thoſe words to an explication of any diſtinct conception ſignified by them, nor can uſe or apply thoſe words they learn to the things they ſignifie, nor can they connex their words or ſentences in coherence with the matter which they ſignifie; and commonly have recourſe to their wild natural notes when they would expreſs their imaginations or paſſions, which notes are at the beſt but like natural interjections, framed by Nature, not by Art, to diſcover their paſſions or impreſſions; and their artificial lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage or notes are no other than impreſſions upon their ſenſitive Memory by iterated uſe, and drawn out from them upon the ſtrength of ſuch impreſſion, or by repetition of Objects that excite that Memory.</p>
               <p>Thus much I thought good to premiſe concerning the vegetable and ſenſitive natures; which may be of ſome uſe in the conſideration of the rational or humane nature; partly to inſtance what this latter includes, namely the whole perfection of the vegetable and animal faculties, and partly to diſcover the preference that the Humane Nature hath above the Animal Life in theſe moſt perfect faculties of Intellect, intellectual Reaſon, and Will.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here diſtinctly and fully examine the nature of Man in the whole compaſs and extent thereof, but ſhall reſerve it to a fuller inquiry; I ſhall only inſtance in ſo much thereof in this place as may be appoſite to my purpoſe, namely, to ſhew that he is a Creature of moſt admirable conſtitution, and ſuch as deſerves our inquiry, and ſuch whoſe firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and origination requires a higher and nobler Conſtituent than either Chance or the ordinary method of meer Natural cauſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences; and that it is ſuch a piece as in its firſt conſtitution and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation requires an Efficient of infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs: This is the end and ſcope of my preſent Inquiry.</p>
               <p>Now to give a brief Inventory of the Excellence of the Humane Nature, I ſhall obſerve as near as I can this order.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will briefly conſider thoſe Excellencies that he hath in common with the vegetable and ſenſible nature: Secondly, I ſhall conſider thoſe ſpecifical or appropriate Excellencies that he hath above the former, both vegetable and animal nature.</p>
               <p>Under the Second general I ſhall conſider Man ſingly with relation to himſelf, and then with relation to other things without him.</p>
               <p>In relation to himſelf I ſhall briefly conſider theſe particulars: 1. The excellency of his Soul or intellectual nature in its nature, faculties, acts and habits; 2. The peculiar excellency of his Body; 3. The peculiar excellency of the <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> conſiſting of both his former eſſential parts.</p>
               <p>In relation to things without him, I ſhall conſider him with relation 1. To God, 2. To Mankind, 3. To the other integrals of the World;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64147:32"/>
and therein 1. Of their ſerviceableneſs and accommodation to him; 2. Of his dominion and ſoveraignty over them, and the means and inſtruments thereof.</p>
               <p>This is the brief Scheme that I intend of thoſe ſpecifical and appropriate preheminences that the Nature of Man hath above other viſible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, touching thoſe Excellencies that the humane Nature hath above the vegetable and animal Nature, I ſhall ſubjoin theſe enſuing Poſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no excellent vegetable or animal Faculty in the vegetable or animal Nature, as ſuch, but it is found in the humane Nature; ſuch as are attraction, nutrition, digeſtion, conformation of parts digeſted, proportionable augmentation, generation, ſenſible perception, common ſenſe, eſtimative faculty, ſenſible appetite, locomotive faculty, and animal motion: I meddle not herein with all thoſe ſmaller ſort of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which are peculiarly appropriate to Vegetables or Animals, as ſwiftneſs, ſagacity, ſtrength, and ſpecial artifices, which belong not to them in the common nature of Vegetables or Animals, but by certain ſpecifical Inſtincts or Faculties, becauſe though it may be ſome of them are not found in the ſame kind and degree in the humane Nature, yet they are ſuch as are abundantly recompenſed by that art and ingeny which appropriately belongs to the humane Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are no Organs in the ſenſible Nature (which yet are more perfect than thoſe of the vegetable Nature) ſubſervient to the Faculties of Life and Senſe, which are wanting in the conſtitution of the humane Body, at leaſt in ſubſtance and equivalence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe very Faculties and Organs ſubſervient unto them in the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or ſenſible Nature, which are found in them, are lodged in the humane Nature in far more excellency and perfection than they are in the vegetable or animal Nature: So that if the Faculties or Organs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the vegetable or animal Life in Man, do differ in their ſtate or compoſure from thoſe of Brutes, it differs for the better, as obtaining a more exquiſite perfection, uſefulneſs, beauty, and contexture, than thoſe of Brutes, as may appear in the Hand of Man compared with the Foot of Beaſts or Birds; the Foot, the Leg, the Thigh of Man, with thoſe of Beaſts, and the like. It is true, the conſtitution of ſome Faculties and Organs of Senſibles, is more accommodate to their fabrick and uſe than the like Organs of Man would be to the uſe of Brutes; but ſimply comparing one with another, the Organs of the humane Body are more curious and excellent than the Organs of the bare animal Nature. And from hence it comes to paſs, that the full knowledge of the humane Faculties and Organs, ſubſervient to the animal Life in Man, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends in effect all the like Faculties and Organs in the animal Nature, though differing in ſome particular textures and poſitions, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable advance by the acceſs of excellence of the humane Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the ſpecifical or appropriate Excellencies of the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture above the moſt perfect Animals, they come next to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>It is true, that Animals in proportion to the length of their Life attain their complement of their ſpecifical perfection ſooner in proportion than the humane Nature: The animal Soul ſooner expands and evolves it ſelf
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64147:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to its full orb and extent than the humane Soul: Therefore the Horſe that lives naturally about thirty years, comes to his full growth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect exerciſe of its animal Faculties in four years; but Man, that lives not ordinarily above ſeventy yeas, comes not to the ripeneſs of his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Life 'till two and twenty or three and twenty years at leaſt, nor even to his full growth 'till nineteen or twenty: So that what we ſay concerning Man, in relation to the actings of his Mind, muſt be applied to that ſtate and age wherein his Soul hath fully as it were evolved it ſelf, and its Organs fully mature and diſpoſed for the actings of his Soul: He is long ripening, but then his maturity, and the complement thereof, recompenſeth the flowneſs of his maturation.</p>
               <p>Now the Excellencies appropriate to the humane Nature are, as before, obſerved of two kinds; 1. ſuch as immediately concern the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf; or 2. ſuch as are extrinſecal, but yet relating to it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things that are immediately reſiding in, or part of the humane Nature, come firſt to be conſidered: And they are three: 1. His Soul, or intellectual and volitive Principle. 2. His Body, or corporeal part. 3. The <hi>Compoſitum</hi> or <hi>Coalitum</hi> of both thoſe Principles, which complete the humane Nature.</p>
               <p>The Soul comes firſt to be conſidered, and therein theſe four things: 1. Its Conſtitution or Nature. 2. Its Original. 3. Its Faculties. 4. Its congenite Habits or rational Inſtincts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the Conſtitution of the Intellectual Soul of Man, I ſhall not in this place enter into a large diſcourſe concerning it, but reſerve that conſideration to its proper place, only in general it is 1. An active principle; 2. It is a ſubſtantial principle; 3. It is not corporeal or material; 4. It is not corruptible or mortal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Touching its Original, whether it be by traduction, or creation, or participation, I ſhall not here diſpute, but reſerve it to its proper place for a fuller diſquiſition. But whether the one way or the other it had its original, there is no inconſiſtency but that it hath thoſe eſſential qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations above-mentioned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Touching its Faculties, they are two, the Underſtanding and the Will: And here I ſhall not concern my ſelf in the Inquiry, whether the Faculties are the ſame with the Soul it ſelf, or the ſame one with the other, and only diſtinct in notion? whether the Will be any more than the complete or ultimate act of the Underſtanding determined? It is ſufficient, that the acting of the Soul as it relates to perception and deciſion, and as it relates to choice and purſuit, or averſation, are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable to us, and thoſe notions ſerve to explicate what we mean in the things we diſcourſe of, as the ſuppoſed Circles in the Heavens ſerve to explicate the appearances thereof. The Underſtanding or the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Faculty (the ſhadow whereof only is the Phantaſie in Brutes, but it is but a ſhadow of this of Intellect) is a Faculty that not only gradually but eſſentially differs from and exceeds the perceptive Faculty in Brutes.</p>
               <p>Three things there are that give us the beſt notion we can have of the humane Intellect, and the diſcrimination thereof from the animal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and imagination: 1. The Objects thereof: 2. The Acts thereof: And 3. The Habits thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Object of the humane Intellect is <hi>omne intelligibile,</hi> which is of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64147:33"/>
a far larger extent than the Object of ſenſible perception or imagination, which as it exceeds not the province of ſenſible Objects, ſo it is in order to the convenience of a ſenſible Life. For inſtance: When a Brute ſees a Man, it ſees his colour, figure, motion, bulk, and by the advantage of Memory or Inſtinct it comes to him, or flyes from him, as it hath received, or thinks it like to receive good or evil by him, but it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not ſubſtance. Theſe Objects, among many other that might be inſtanced, fall under the perception of the Intellective, which ſeem not to be within the verge of Imagination or ſenſible perception: 1. The Notion of a Spirit, or ſubſtance void of corporeity. 2. Univerſals, or conception of things as conjoined in one common nature or notion, abſtracted from the Individuals thereof. 3. Abſtracted conceptions, as entity, corporeity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. Though Brutes may be able to apprehend multitude, as things more than ſingular, yet they cannot have a diſtinct notion of Number. 5. Though they may have a confuſed imagination of ſomething as paſt, or future, yet it is without diſtinction of Time, or the notion of it. 6. The truth of conſequence in or from the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent. 7. The actings of the Mind or Imagination it ſelf, by way of reflection or introſpection of themſelves, are diſcernible by Man diſtinctly, but at leaſt not diſtinctly by Brutes. 8. The truth and evidence of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Demonſtration. 9. The reaſon or juſt eſtimate of connexion of things to their Cauſes. 10. The moral goodneſs and congruity, or evilneſs, unfitneſs, and unſeaſonableneſs of moral or natural actions; which falls not within the verge of a brutal faculty. 11. The Notions of a Deity, and the reſult thereupon, namely, Religion, is not to be found in Brutes, but ſeems connatural to the humane Nature, as ſhall be ſhewn.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Intellectual Acts, and they are many:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Intellectual Perception, which greatly differs from imaginative or ſenſitive perception, as far above it: For in thoſe things where the root of intellective perception is in the ſenſe and phantaſie, the perception intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective oftentimes departs from and corrects the report of the phantaſie, as in the apparent bigneſs of the Sun, the apparent crookedneſs of the Staff in a double <hi>medium</hi> of Air and Water; though this kind of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Perception be not without the help of Ratiocination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Intellective Ratiocination, which infinitely exceeds that imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ratiocination which ſome have attributed to Brutes. 1. It is diſtinct, and with a diſtinct knowledge of the terms, which in Brutes is confuſed, 2. It is founded for the moſt part in Univerſals, which is not compatible to imaginative Ratiocination. 3. The thread and train of Conſequences in intellective Ratiocination is often long, and chained together by divers Links, which cannot be done in imaginative diſcourſe or ratiocination by ſome attributed to Brutes, which if the <hi>tranſitus</hi> from the premiſſes to the concluſion be not very ſpeedy and ſhort, that imperfect Ratiocination is loſt in Brutes.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall again a little reſume the former Conſideration touching the imaginary Reaſoning of Brutes, which I have before called the Image of Reaſon, and not truly Reaſon; for it is not a diſtinct reaſoning, but performed in a phyſical moment: And though we ſuppoſe Subject, and Predicate, and <hi>Copula,</hi> and Propoſitions, and Syllogiſtical Connexions
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64147:34"/>
in their Reaſoning, there is no ſuch matter, but the entire buſineſs is at the ſame moment preſent with them without deducing one thing from another, though we form them into notions of diſtinct acts; and this acting of the ſentient Phantaſie is performed, 1. By a preſence of ſenſe, as the Horſe is under the ſenſe of hunger, and that without any formal Syllogiſm preſſeth him to eat: the fire burns the Cats foot, and therefore it pulleth it away becauſe the immediate ſenſe of pain enforceth it. 2. By the preſence of Memory; the Dog hath been beaten for taking the meat out of the diſh, and the next time he ſees it there, though he be hungry yet he dares not venture, for his imaginative Memory makes the paſt ſtrokes as preſent to him as if he felt them. 3. By the preſence of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, which puts him upon thoſe motions that are moſt evidently as reaſonable as any thing can be, and yet without the intervention of Ratiocination. For inſtance, Every Creature almoſt hath certain Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for its defence, and the offence of its enemies, exactly fitted for their uſe, and they have that ſingular dexterity in uſing them that the moſt diſciplined Fencer cannot equal: The Cock, for inſtance, hath his Spurs, and he ſtrikes his Feet inward with ſingular ſtrength and order, and it is not poſſible he ſhould uſe his Spurs with greater reaſon for his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; yet he doth not this by any ſyllogiſtical method, or by Ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but is meerly tutored to it by Inſtinct, which is preſent with him, and at hand without any diſcurſive Reaſoning. And this appears, becauſe while it is yet a Chick, and hath no Spurs, nor cannot hurt by it, nor yet hath ſeen the like motion before to imitate or learn it; yet he readily practiſeth it. And to theſe three preſent impulſes of Senſe, Memory, and Inſtinct, moſt if not all the ſagacities of Brutes may be reduced without the help of true Ratiocination or diſcurſive Reaſon; though witty men by Analytical reſolution have Chymically extracted an artificial Logick out of all their actions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Intellective Memory, which I call an act of the intellective faculty becauſe it is wrought by it, though I do not inquire how or where, becauſe it is not ſolvible: The ſpecifical preferences that it hath above the ſenſible Memory are theſe; 1. That it remembers and retains ſuch things as were never at all in the Senſe, as the conceptions, enuntiations and actions of the Intellect and Will; the conviction of truth or falſhood of propoſitions or reaſonings; the conceptions of univerſals: whereas the ſenſitive Memory retains nothing but ſenſible Objects, or their Images wrought by the Phantaſie. 2. In that it is more complicated and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex than the ſenſitive Memory, retaining the <hi>ſeries</hi> of propoſitions, argumentations, and a long tract of hiſtorical narratives. 3. In that it is more diſtinct and unconfuſed than the ſenſitive Memory. 4. In that it is firmer, and more fixed and permanent than the ſenſitive Memory. 5. In that it can reſuſcitate and ſtir up it ſelf to remember and call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther other Images or <hi>media</hi> to retrive what it once remembred; which is Reminiſcence, an act of intention, which therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Book <hi>De Memoria &amp; Reminiſcentia</hi> makes an act peculiar to Man; whereas the Memory of Brutes is either conſerved by the Images impreſſed by the Imagination, and there continued, or revived and reinforced by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of external Objects bearing an identity or reſemblance to the Images at firſt impreſſed by the Phantaſie.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:64147:34"/>4. Deliberation; a ſtaid and attentive conſideration of things to be known and their <hi>media,</hi> and of their ſeveral weights, concluſiveneſs, or evidence; and of things to be done and their <hi>media,</hi> their congruity, ſuitableneſs, poſſibility and convenience, and of the ſeveral circumſtances aptly conducible thereunto; which is an act far above the animal actings, which are ſudden and tranſient, and admit not of that attention, <hi>mora,</hi> and propendency of actions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Judgment; either concerning things to be known, of the weight and concludency of them and ends in deciſion; or of things done or to be done, of their congruity, fitneſs, rightneſs, appoſitneſs: and this if it refers to things to be done, ends in determination or purpoſe; if in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to things already done, then in ſentence of approbation or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation: And hither that which we call Conſcience is to be referred, namely, if by a due compariſon of things done with the rule, there be a conſonancy follows the ſentence of Approbation; if diſcordant from it, the ſentence of Condemnation.</p>
               <p>And this act of the Judgment in relation to things to be done, and the determination thereupon, is that which is uſually ſtiled the laſt deciſion of the practical Underſtanding immediately antecedent to the decree of the Will, which it muſt follow by a kind of moral neceſſity, when it acts as a reaſonable Faculty, and in the due ſtate and order of its nature; though by its liberty and empire it ſometimes ſuſpends its concurrence. And thus far concerning the Acts of the Underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning intellectual Habits or the genuine effects of theſe acts in the underſtanding Faculty, and they are divers and diverſly expreſſed by thoſe that have treated thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Opinion, when the aſſent of the Underſtanding is ſo far gained by evidence of probability, that it rather inclines to one perſwaſion than to another, yet not altogether without a mixture of incertainty or doubting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Science or Knowledge effected by ſuch evidence, <hi>cui non poteſt ſubeſſe falſum;</hi> as in caſe of demonſtrative evidence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Fides,</hi> or Faith, or Belief, which reſts upon the relation of another that we have no reaſonable cauſe to ſuſpect; and upon this account we believe Divine Revelation when we are ſufficiently convinced that it is Divine Revelation; we alſo believe our Senſes, becauſe we have the greateſt Moral evidence that we can reaſonably have of the truth of their reports, when they are not controlled by apparent Reaſon, impoſſibility, or improbability: We believe good and credible perſons, and this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally referrs to matter of fact, which we cannot or do not controll by our Senſes or other weighty evidence; as that there was ſuch a man as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> that there is ſuch a place as <hi>Rome,</hi> though we never ſaw the one or the other; becauſe delivered over to us by credible perſons, and ſuch who could probably have no end to deceive us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wiſdom; which is a complicated habit referring to all things to be known and done, the due compariſon of things and actions, and the preference of them according to their various natures and degrees.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Prudence; which is principally in reference to actions to be done, the due means, order, ſeaſon, method of doing or not doing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Moral Virtues; as Juſtice, Temperance, Sobriety, Fortitude,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64147:35"/>
Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe begin in the Intellect, though their exerciſe belong principally to the faculty of the Will.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Arts Liberal or Mechanical; for though the exerciſe of thoſe (in which the formal nature of an Art conſiſts) be external, yet the Ideal notion and habit of them begins in the Underſtanding; and a man is firſt a Geometrician in his Brain, before he be ſuch in his Hand.</p>
               <p>And all theſe habits of the intellectual Faculty are far advanced above what is found in Senſible Natures; take the laſt for inſtance. It is true, we find a rare dexterity in the Spider and Silkworm in framing of their threads, but this proceeds not from any Intellectual principle in them, but from an Inſtinct connatural to them, and whereunto they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Law of their nature; again, we find in the Fox, the Hawk, and other Animals admirable ſagacities, wiles and ſubtilties in getting their prey and in defending themſelves: But when we conſider the ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Humane Underſtanding, although the particular Inſtincts of ſome Animals are ſcarce imitable by it, yet it exceeds them in other things almoſt of the ſame nature, and ſo by way of equivalence, or rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in thoſe very Inſtincts; witneſs the Arts of Painting, Tapeſtry, Fortification, Architecture, the Engins whereby noxious and ſubtil Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are ſubdued, and infinite more ariſing from the fruitfulneſs of the Underſtanding and the dexterity of the Hand. And thus much touching the Intellective Faculty, the ſeat of intellective Perception and Counſel: I come to conſider of that other Faculty, the Will, the ſeat of Empire and Authority.</p>
               <p>The Will therefore is that other great Faculty of the Reaſonable Soul, and it is not a bare appetitive power as that of the ſenſual appetite, but is a rational appetite, and is conſiderable, 1. In its Nature, 2. In its Object, 3. In its Acts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Nature of this Faculty is that it is free, <hi>domina ſuarum actionum,</hi> free from compulſion, and ſo ſpontaneous, and free from determination by the particular Object, wherein it differs from the ſenſitive appetite, which though ſpontaneous, becauſe moving from an inward principle, yet is, if not altogether, yet for the moſt part determined in its choice by the external Object. But how far forth the Will is determined by the laſt act of the practick Underſtanding, or how far ſuch a determination is, or is not conſiſtent with the eſſential or natural liberty of the Will, is not ſeaſonable here to diſpute. This liberty of Will, together with that other Faculty of Underſtanding, is that which renders the humane Nature properly capable of a Law, and of the conſequence of Law, Rewards and Puniſhments; which doth not properly belong to the animal Nature, becauſe deſtitute of theſe two Faculties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Object of the Will is not confined to a ſenſible Good, but is much larger, namely, ſuch a Good as is compatible to an Intellectual Nature in its full latitude, ſuch as are moral and ſupernatural Good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Acts of this Faculty are generally divided into Volition, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, and Suſpenſion: That diviſion that herein better ſuits with my purpoſe are theſe, Election and Empire.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Election or choice, and this in reference both to means and end; for though the Schools tell us, that <hi>Electio</hi> is only <hi>mediorum &amp; non finis,</hi> this is to be intended of the general end or good at large, and in its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64147:35"/>
conception, for when ſeveral particular ends are in propoſal, there is belonging to the Will a power of Election of theſe, as well as of the means to attain them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Imperium voluntatis</hi> over the Body and the Faculties: We may obſerve in the humane as well as the animal Body two kinds of motions or exertions of Faculties; ſome are ſtiled natural or involuntary, ſuch is the motion of the Heart, the Circulation of the Blood, the perception of the Senſes; when the Organs are open, and the Object applied, theſe natural, though vital Faculties and Motions, are not under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Will immediately, for whether I will or will not, while I live, my Heart beats, my Blood circulates, my Ventricle digeſts what is in it, my Eye ſees when open. But there be other Motions in the humane, and alſo in the animal Nature, that are ſubject to the command of the Will in Man, and to the appetite in Brutes, as local motion, which in Animals is under the regiment of the Appetite, in Man under the regiment of the Will.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Imperium voluntatis</hi> may be conſidered in relation,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To it ſelf: It can ſuſpend its own acting, either of electing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the Underſtanding: Though it cannot ſuſpend its perception, <hi>omnibus ad percipiendum requiſitis adhibitis,</hi> yet it may ſuſpend its deciſion or determination, or at leaſt its <hi>obſequium</hi> to ſuch deciſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Paſſions, which are as it were the <hi>Satellites voluntatis,</hi> and follow the command of the Will, where the Will acts according to its power and authority.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To the animal Spirits, and the Veſſels in which they are received when deſigned to Motion, namely the Nerves and Muſcles, thoſe are all ſubject to the Empire of the Will, as to Local Motion of the whole Body or any part thereof, when the Spirits, Nerves and Muſcles are in their due and natural ſtate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To the ſenſual Appetite: And indeed herein is evident both the Empire and Sovereignty of the Will, and alſo the viſible diſcrimination between the Humane Nature and the Animal or Brutal Nature, and its preference before it. In the animal Nature it is evident that the ſenſual Appetite is that which hath and exerciſeth the ſovereignty and dominion over the ſpontaneous actions of the animal Nature, that commands the Foot to go, the Mouth to eat, and all other the ſpontaneous motions in order to a ſenſible good: But in Man the ſenſual Appetite is <hi>Regimen ſub graviere regimine,</hi> the government of the Appetite is under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Will and controlled by it, at leaſt where the reaſonable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is not embaſed and captived by ill cuſtom or diſorder. And this appears two ways:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes the very motion of the Appetite it ſelf is reſtrained by the Empire of the Will, ſo that a man doth not <hi>appetere</hi> that ſenſible good which otherwiſe he might or would, becauſe he will not; and this is the moſt natural and noble regiment of the Will over the ſenſual Appetite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though it may fall out that the ſenſual Appetite may <hi>appetere bonum ſenſibile,</hi> yet the Will may and doth controll the empire of the Appetite in the execution of that appetition: As for inſtance, A man ſees delicious
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64147:36"/>
fruit, and he deſires it; in ſo much, that were there not a controll over the empire of his Appetite, it would command the Hand to reach it, and the Mouth to eat it: But the contrary command of the Will ſuperſedes the command of the Appetite; the Appetite deſires it, but the Hand is forbidden by the Will to reach it.</p>
               <p>Now if any man ſhall ſay this contradiction appears, not only in the reaſonable Nature, but even in the ſenſible: The ſenſible Appetite is checked in its execution oftentimes by ſenſual Fear, as in Dogs and Horſes, and other Brutes, yea ſometimes by the remembrance of a former ſuffering for the like attempt to gratifie his ſenſual Appetite; and yet they are deſtitute of any ſuperior faculty of Will to interpoſe a prohibition upon the Appetite. I anſwer, this is true, for in ſuch caſes the impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Fear is either preſent or in memory, and ſo expected; and it being of a ſenſible evil, hath the ſame influence upon the ſenſual Appetite as the preſent good; and therefore if the evil feared or impendent be a greater ſenſible evil than the good, it over-rules the Appetite to aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; as the Fiſh that loves the bait, yet feareth the hook, which it diſcerns as a greater ſenſible evil, the very Appetite is thereby determined to averſation.</p>
               <p>But the controll of the Will upon the Appetite in the reaſonable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is many times, and indeed moſt often done, not upon the account of a ſenſible evil felt or feared, which of it ſelf were ſufficient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the Appetite; but ſometimes upon the account of ſuch hopes or fears as fall not under a ſenſitive notice, as of the command or prohibition by God; yea many times upon a bare Moral account of the <hi>indecorum,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs, unſeaſonableneſs or utter unfitneſs of the thing it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other motive of fear either of a preſent or future ſenſible incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience thereby; which Moral conſideration can no way move the ſenſible Appetite, were it not for the Will, which being a rational Faculty is moved by it.</p>
               <p>And this is all that I ſhall ſay touching the two great Faculties of the Soul, the Underſtanding and Will: I ſhall not add any thing here touching Paſſions or Affections of the Mind, 1. Becauſe they are but a kind of appendices to the Will, the <hi>Satellites voluntatis;</hi> thoſe of the concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kind being as it were the flowers of the motion of Volition, thoſe of the iraſcible kind the flowers of the motion of Averſation. 2. Becauſe the Paſſions for the moſt part are found in the ſenſible Nature, namely thoſe of love, hatred, delight, grief, expectation and fear; and therefore I ſhall not here treat of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I come now to conſider of thoſe rational Inſtincts as I call them, the connate Principles engraven in the humane Soul; which though they are Truths acquirable and deducible by rational conſequence and argumentation, yet they ſeem to be inſcribed in the very <hi>craſis</hi> and texture of the Soul antecedent to any acquiſition by induſtry or the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the diſcurſive Faculty in Man, and therefore they may be well called anticipations, prenotions, or ſentiments characterized and engraven in the Soul, born with it, and growing up with it till they receive a check by ill cuſtoms or educations, or an improvement and advancement by the due exerciſe of the Faculties. I ſhall ſhew firſt what they are: Secondly, what moves me to think that ſuch are connatural.</p>

Touching the former, I think thoſe implanted and connatural anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipations are theſe; namely, That there is a God; that he is of greateſt Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Perfection; that he is pleaſed with good, and diſpleaſed with evil; that he is placable; that he is to be feared, honoured, loved, worſhipped, and obeyed; that he will reward the good, and puniſh the evil; a ſecret ſentiment of the immortality of the Soul, or that it ſurvives the Body to be capable of rewards and puniſhments, according to its deportment in this life; certain common notions of Moral good and evil, of <hi>decorum</hi> and <hi>turpe;</hi> that faith and promiſes are to be kept; that a man muſt do as he would be done by; that the obſcene parts and actions, though otherwiſe natural, are not to be expoſed to publick view, <hi>obvelatio pudendorum;</hi> that a man muſt be grateful for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit received; Theſe, and ſome ſuch common notions or intimate propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſeem to be con naturally engraven in the Soul antecedently to any diſcurſive Ratiocination; and though they are not ſo diſtinct and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, yet they are ſecret Byaſſes inclining the humane Nature primarily to what is uſeful and convenient for it in proportion to the ſtate of an intellectual Nature: That as we ſee in Brutes, beſides the exerciſe of their Faculties of ſenſitive Perception and Imagination, there are lodged in them certain ſenſible Inſtincts antecedent to their imaginative Faculty, whereby they are pre-determined to the good and convenience of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Life: So there are lodged in the very <hi>craſis</hi> and conſtitution of the Soul certain rational Inſtincts whereby it is pre-diſpoſed, inclined, and byaſſed to the good and convenience proportionable to a rational and intellectual Life; a certain congenite ſtock of rational Sentiments and Inclinations which may go along with him, and fairly incline him to ſuch a trade and way as is ſuitable to the good of his Nature; ſo that he is not left barely to the undetermination, incertainty, and unſteadineſs of the operation of his Faculties, without a certain ſecret and gentle pre-diſpoſition of them to what is right, decent, and convenient for their manage and guidance by theſe common anticipations, inclinations, and connatural Characters engraven in the Soul. 2. And that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines me to believe this, is not only the congruity of the ſuppoſition to the convenience of the humane Nature, and the inſtance of the ſenſible Inſtincts in the animal Nature proportionate to their convenience, and the great importance of them to the convenience thereof: But alſo that which is obſervable in the attentive conſideration of the manners of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, which ſeems to have thoſe common ſentiments in them, and to accord in them in a very great meaſure; and though evil Cuſtoms and Education much prevails among men, yet it doth not wholly ob<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate theſe ſentiments, at leaſt from the generality of Mankind.</p>
               <p>It muſt be agreed that theſe rational Inſtincts, as I call them, are not always ſo vigorous and uniform in their actings as the animal Inſtincts of Brutes are in their kind, which partly proceeds from that liberty of Will that is in the humane Nature which many times ſuſpends or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts their energy and operation, partly from that mixture of the ſentient Appetite with the actings of the reaſonable Soul, which oftentimes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it: Even the more ſimple and uncompounded any Nature is, the more uniform are its motions and actings; the natural Inſtincts and Pro-portions even of things inanimate (as of heavy Bodies to deſcend) are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64147:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more uniform than the very Inſtincts of Brutes, who have a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated form or nature; But as this accidental interruption of rational Inſtincts doth not diſprove their exiſtences, ſo Man hath a greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by the exerciſe of his Reaſon and intellective Faculties, to remove thoſe interruptions, and improve thoſe connatural Sentiments or rational Inſtincts to his ſingular uſe and benefit, which abundantly recompenceth thoſe Interruptions.</p>
               <p>And if any ſhall ſay that there are or may be other means of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of thoſe motions and inclinations in Men, namely, 1. A Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional traduction of them into the World; and 2. The Exerciſe of the humane Intellectual Faculties upon the occurrence and obſervation of external Objects and Events: I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As touching Traditional communication and traduction of thoſe Truths that I call connatural and engraven, I do not doubt but many of thoſe Truths have had the help of that derivation: But, firſt, ſuch a Tradition poſſibly hath not been without interruptions by evil Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and yet theſe Sentiments have obtained almoſt in all Ages and Places, though not without interſperſion of certain corrupt additaments, obtained likewiſe by evil Cuſtom or Education. But ſecondly, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be ſuppoſed that a Tradition could ſo conſtantly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally prevail and obtain among Mankind, unleſs there were ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſonancy and congruity of ſomewhat inherent in Nature which ſuits, correſponds and ſuffragates to that Tradition, and cloſeth with it, and accepts it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the other, concerning the Exerciſe and Actings of our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Faculties, it muſt needs be agreed that thoſe that I call Conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principles are in themſelves highly reaſonable, and deducible by a ſtrong proceſs of Ratiocination to be moſt true and moſt convenient; and conſequently the high exerciſe of Ratiocination or intellective Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe might evince their truth and excellency, though there were no ſuch originally inſcribed in the Mind: But this no more concludes againſt the ſuppoſition, than it would conclude againſt the ſuppoſition of implanted Inſtincts in Brutes; which as they are in themſelves highly reaſonable and uſeful to their ends, and evincible by true Reaſon to be ſuch, as it may be any thing we know: So alſo many, though not all the actings of thoſe Inſtincts might poſſibly in the Brutes themſelves be elicited by a ſtrong intention and exerciſe of their Phantaſie and ſenſible Perception, Ratiocination, and Connatural Implantation, are but ſeveral means or diſcoveries of the ſame thing which in it ſelf is moſt highly reaſonable; only the latter is for the moſt part leſs difficult, and readier at hand. But to the Objection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let any man but duly conſider how few men there are in the World that are capable in reſpect of the meanneſs of their Parts and Education, to act and improve their Intellects or Faculties to ſo high a ſtrain as the eliciting of thoſe that I call Connatural Principles by the ſtrength of their Intellectual Operation; this requires very choice Parts, great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Mind, ſequeſtration from the importunity of Secular employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and a long advertent and deliberate connexing of Conſequents; which falls not in the common road of ordinary men, but of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Metaphyſical heads, and ſuch as have had a more refined education,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64147:37"/>
which is not the thouſandth part of Mankind; Other men require a more eaſie and familiar acceſs to theſe Truths and Inclinations; and yet we ſee that theſe Sentiments are not confined to the <hi>Literati</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, I appeal to the moſt knowing men in the World that have but had the leiſure to think ſeriouſly and converſe with themſelves, and that have kept their Minds free from the fumes of intemperance and exceſs, paſſion and perturbation; whether next under Divine Revelation their beſt and cleareſt ſentiments of Morality at leaſt have not been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the due animadverſion and inſpection of their own Minds, and the improving of that ſtock of Morals that they there find, and the tranſcribing of that Original which they found firſt written there: It is true, that it is with the connatural Principles inſcribed in our Minds as it is with our Faculties, they lye more torpid, and inactive, and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, unleſs they are awakened and exerciſed, like a ſpark involved in aſhes; and being either ſuppreſſed or neglected they ſeem little better than dead, but being diligently attended, inſpected and exerciſed, they expand and evolve themſelves into more diſtinction and evidence of themſelves. And therefore it was not without ſome kind of probability that ſome of the Ancients thought that Science was little elſe than Memory or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſcence, a diſcovery of what was in the Soul before. But whatever may be ſaid of other matters, certainly the firſt draughts and ſtrictures of Natural Religion and Morality are naturally in the Mind.</p>
               <p>And hence ſome thinking men have thought that the ſpecifical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the humane Nature is Propenſion to Religion, and therefore define Man to be <hi>Animal religioſum,</hi> which could not be from any habit barely acquiſite by the exerciſe of Faculties, unleſs the ſame were radically engraven in the very texture of his Soul.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add but this one thing more: It is plain that the exiſtence of a Deity as a Being of infinite Perfection, and conſequently of infinite Goodneſs and Juſtice to reward and puniſh, and of infinite Power and Wiſdom, is a truth that is highly rational and demonſtrable by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of intellectual Faculties upon the conſideration of the Univerſe and its ſeveral parts; and poſſibly the Immortality of the Soul is evincible by very great reaſon: But theſe great truths are not communicated barely by one kind of means, and it is needful, in reſpect of their uſe, they ſhould all have all contributions, and not only Brains to purſue a long train of conſequences. And yet we ſhall find in the generality of mankind (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when death begins to draw towards them) a very quick and active demonſtration of theſe convictions, and poſſibly many times more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and active than that rational conviction that is wrought by Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation and Syllogiſms; which evidenceth that theſe Principles of the exiſtence of a moſt righteous and powerful God, and a ſtate of rewards and puniſhments after death, are more univerſally engraven in the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Soul by Almighty God in its natural conſtitution than barely by the exerciſe of Faculties in Speculation and Ratiocination.</p>
               <p>And herein it muſt be remembred that I am in this Diſcourſe ſtill in the outward Court of the Gentiles, diſcourſing only as a reaſonable Man, and not taking in the aſſiſtance of the Chriſtian Doctrine and thoſe <hi>ſubſidia divinae gratiae</hi> that relate thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:64147:38"/>Therefore to conclude this point, There ſeems to be two means of communicating and preſerving in the Soul and Conſcience theſe great ſpeculative and moral Principles whereof I have even now treated, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That which I here call Connatural, or a certain rational Inſtinct en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in the very Make and conſtitution of it: And as thoſe that write of Conſcience tell; us it hath three offices or acts, <hi>Syntereſis, Syneideſis,</hi> and <hi>Epicriſis;</hi> ſo thoſe Principles are lodged in that Cheſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience called <hi>Syntereſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond means of attaining and keeping and improving theſe connatural Sentiments or rational Inſtincts both ſpeculative and moral, is that admirable adaptation of the Faculties of the humane Soul to thoſe Principles and Sentiments, that as the Eye diſcerns light and colour by a congruity between the viſive Faculty and the viſible Object, and as the Palate taſts and reliſheth its meat by the congruity between the Faculty and the Object, whereby it judgeth of what is good and embraceth it, and what is evil to it, and rejects it: So in the humane Faculties, thoſe of his Intellect and Will there is a proportionating of the Faculties to the Object, whereby the former diſcerns truth from falſhood, and moral good from moral evil, <hi>honeſtum &amp; decorum</hi> from <hi>indecens &amp; turpe;</hi> and accordingly the Will, when it acts regularly and as it ſhould, accepts or rejects it: But as the eſtimative Faculty in Brutes is nevertheleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their connatural Inſtincts, which latter have ſtill excellent uſe in the ſentient Province; ſo this adaptation of the Faculties in Man to their Objects doth not exclude thoſe connatural, implanted, rational Inſtincts in the humane Nature, but both conſiſt together, and are of admirable uſe to the humane Soul.</p>
               <p>And thus far concerning the Soul of Man, its Faculties and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts.</p>
               <p>I come now to conſider of the ſtructure and fabrick of the humane Body, and that not at large, for that will be for another place, but briefly and ſummarily to give an account of ſome of thoſe appropriate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating notices wherein it differs from and hath preference above the moſt perfect brutal Nature: And they are ſuch as either concern the entire Fabrick of the Body, or ſuch as concern ſome ſpecial Parts or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grals thereof: but I ſhall mingle them together as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is in the humane Fabrick a greater Majeſty and Beauty than in any Animal in the World beſides; and that appears, 1. In the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his poſture; all other Animals have tranſverſe Bodies, as Birds and Beaſts, and though ſome do raiſe themſelves upon their hinder legs to an upright poſture, yet they cannot endure it long, it is unnatural and uneaſie to them, neither are the figures or junctures or order of their Bones, Nerves, and Muſcles fitted to ſuch a poſture. And it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that the ſtructure of Man's Body is with that equilibration (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding divers prominences therein) the compoſure of his Nerves and Muſcles for the due motion of his Spirits, the ſtructure of his Feet are ſo ſingularly accommodated; that he maintains this erect poſture ſtanding or walking, though his Feet, the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Pillar of his Body, be much narrower than the latitude of his Body. 2. In the Majeſty of his Face and Eyes. 3. In the Beauty of his Face: Beauty conſiſts principally in theſe things, Figure, Symmetry, and Colour. No Bird, or terreſtrial
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64147:38"/>
Animal exhibits its Face in the native colour of its Skin but Man; all others are covered with Feathers, or Hair, or a <hi>Cortex</hi> that is obduced over the <hi>Cutis,</hi> as in Elephants and ſome ſort of <hi>Indian</hi> Dogs; and though in the torrid Climates the common colour is black or ſwarthy, yet the natural colour of the temperate Climates is more tranſparent and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no Animal hath any Organ of equal uſe to the Arm and Hand of a Man, that <hi>Organum organorum,</hi> an Organ accommodate to all the uſeful motions, operations, arts and uſes of his life: Man is born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any offenſive or defenſive weapons like to thoſe of other Animals, but by the uſefulneſs and accommodation of this Organ and his Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive faculty he maketh weapons and uſeth them, he forgeth and mouldeth Metals, builds Houſes and Ships, makes his Cloaths and Ornaments, and exerciſeth all Arts for uſe and ornament.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is no Creature that I know of, hath the like ſtructure of his Leg and Foot; the former being only two to ſupport his Body, have greater and larger Muſcles than any Animal of no greater proportionable bigneſs; and the latter being the <hi>Baſis</hi> of thoſe Pillars, are admirably fitted by their length and figure for his <hi>greſſus progreſſivus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Since the Brain is the great Organ of Intellection in Man, and of Imagination in Brutes, which are the two nobleſt Faculties of either Nature, it will not be amiſs to examine the differences between the Brain of either, and the Nerves proceeding from either, wherein none that I know hath given more light than Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> in his Anatomy of the Head; all therefore that I ſhall do herein ſhall be to gather up the moſt of thoſe obſervable differences that lye diſperſed in that Book.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The humane Brain is in proportion to the Body much greater and larger than the Brains of Brutes, having regard to the ſize and proportion of their Bodies, and fuller of <hi>anfractus</hi> or ſinuations, and ſo more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of greater diverſity of employments and uſes in the Perceptive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are in the Brain certain portions called <hi>protuberantia annularis, nates, &amp; teſtes;</hi> and that in thoſe Brutes wherein this <hi>protuberantia annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi> is largeſt in proportion, thoſe Brutes are of greateſt ſagacity and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, as Foxes, Apes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that though in Man thoſe prominences called <hi>nates</hi> and <hi>testes</hi> are the leaſt, yet the <hi>protuberantia annularis</hi> is greater in proportion in Man than in any Animal, the ſtructure of this Organ being fitted to a greater degree of natural ſagacity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That whereas in Brutes the only communication of the Brain with the Heart is by the <hi>nervus paris vagi</hi> derived from the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and ſpreading its branches into the Muſcle of the Heart; in Man there is not only the ſame communication of that Nerve, but a ramification of the <hi>nervus intercoſtalis</hi> is alſo inſerted into the Muſcle of the Heart, whereby a greater communication between the Brain and Heart is maintained in Man than in Brutes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That other ramifications of this <hi>nervus intercoſtalis</hi> are derived into the Cheſt and <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> whereby principally that peculiar affection of Laughter is excited, more appropriate to Man, together alſo thoſe others of Sternutation and other natural actions common to Men and Beaſts are excited, but not from the like communication of that Nerve in Brutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:64147:39"/>And thus much ſhall ſerve to be ſpoken of the peculiarities of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body, though what I before ſaid touching the Faculties of the Animal Nature in Man muſt alſo be remembred touching the organical parts of his Body: There is no Organ in the Brutal Body ſubſervient to the Animal Faculties, which is not found in the Humane Body, with ſuch variations and additions as render them more curious, perfect, uſeful, and admirably accommodate to his Animal Life and Faculties; But of this more fully hereafter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall now ſubjoin a Conſideration of Man in his whole <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> conſiſting of both his eſſential parts of Body and Soul, and of the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Faculties and Organs belonging to either, ſo far forth as they evidence his appropriate and ſpecifical Excellency above the Animal Nature.</p>
               <p>The appropriate or ſpecifical acts of the humane <hi>compoſitum,</hi> are the capacity and faculty of inſtituted Signs, expreſſive of the inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the Mind, which are of two kinds: 1. Audible, 2. Viſible Signs.</p>
               <p>The Audible Signs are inſtituted Speech or Language, the formal nature whereof conſiſts in two things: 1. Articulate Voice; 2. The accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Articulate Voice to the rendring or expreſſing of the inward thoughts or intentions of the Mind: And herein is the great preference of the language of Man above that of Brutes or Birds, who though they have audible ſigns that expreſs ſomething of their Imaginations or Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, yet they extremely differ from humane ſpeech: 1. They are but ſhort and tranſient, like Interjections in ſpeech, whereby though they expreſs the ſudden motions of their Phantaſie, Appetite, or Paſſions, yet they carry not with them any diſtinct <hi>ſeries</hi> or long train of their Imaginations; they are ſhort and ſudden, ſomewhat like Sighs or Eju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in Man. 2. They are not articulate, nor orderly, but ſhort, natural and broken. 3. When Birds, eſpecially by the fabrick of their Tongue and Palate, are taught to uſe articulate words, yet they underſtand not their import, nor do render any conceptions of their Phantaſie by them, nor can anſwer a queſtion by them, but uſe them inſignificantly, as the Organ or Pipe renders the Tune which it underſtands not.</p>
               <p>And by the help of ſignificant and articulate ſpeech, one Man expreſſeth the notions or conceptions of his Mind to another, inſtructs another, mutual commerce and ſociety is maintained, which could never be without inſtituted ſigns.</p>
               <p>And this Act of inſtituted ſigns, eſpecially thoſe of Speech or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, proceeds from the entire <hi>compoſitum,</hi> the Mind inſtituting the ſigns, and communicating its notions and deſires by it, and the Palate, <hi>Larinx,</hi> Tongue, and Lips, forming the Voice according to ſuch inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, whereunto they are moſt admirably accommodated by their Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Nerves, and Muſcles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The inſtituted viſible Signs, are Writings, Geſtures, Tears, Motions of the Eye, Mouth, and Face, which were long to enumerate: By means of writing, former Ages tranſmit the Memorials of ancient times and things to poſterity; Men underſtand the ſentiments, purpoſes, and deſires of one another, though abſent, and the living converſe with thoſe ancient Philoſophers, and others, that are long ſince dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:64147:39"/>And now in this compoſition of the humane Nature, we have theſe things obſervable:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in this contexture of the Humane Body and Intellectual Soul we have a Creature made up, that is, <hi>nexus utriuſque mundi, intellectualis ſcilicet &amp; corporei.</hi> The next Range of Beings above him are the pure and immaterial Intelligences, the next below him is the ſenſible Nature. Man is as it were the <hi>Comes limitaneus</hi> of each Nature, participating of both. And we may obſerve, that in the proceſs of Natural Beings, there ſeem ſome to be Creatures placed as it were in the Confines of ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and participating ſomething of either; as in things that have life and that have not; there is placed the Minerals between the inanimate and vegetable Province, participating ſomething analogical to either: Between the vegetable and ſenſitive Province there are Plant-animals, and ſome kind of Inſects ariſing from Vegetables, that ſeem to participate of both: Between the animal and rational Province, there ſeem to be ſome Animals that have a dark Image or reſemblance of the Influxes of Reaſon. So between the corporeal and intellectual World, there is conſtituted Man, participating much of both Natures: <hi>It a quod non tranſitur ad extreme niſi per media.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That Man in his conſtitution ſeems admirably fitted to the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of his Nature, a little World accommodated with Faculties and Organs admirably convenient to it ſelf, a kind of entire State, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Republick within himſelf, fitted with all accommodations and requiſites for the due Regiment of himſelf, as a Senſible and Intellectual Being: He hath the Council or Senate of his Intellect, and her ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient Acts and Faculties to adviſe him; the Empire and Regiment of his Will to command the <hi>Satellites</hi> and Miniſters of his Paſſions and Animal Spirits to execute his Conſcience for his Tribunal: There wants nothing within this little Circle of himſelf, which may be requiſite to order that little compacted Province for its Political Regiment.</p>
               <p>And thus far concerning Man, as relating to himſelf, his Parts, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and entire Compoſition: It remains, that we take a little ſurvey of him, as he ſtands in relation to things without him; which is the laſt Conſideration that I promiſed in this brief Inventory of the Humane Nature and Excellencies.</p>
               <p>The Humane Nature, thus fitted with theſe Faculties, is admirably accommodated to a threefold relation to ſomewhat without him, namely, To Almighty God: To the reſt of Mankind: And to this <hi>mundus aſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis</hi> wherein he lives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To Almighty God; for being a Creature endued with an Immortal Soul, endued with thoſe great Faculties of Underſtanding and Will, and thoſe <hi>Facultates Ancillares</hi> of his Affections, he is rendred into a capacity, 1. Of knowing Him: 2. Of knowing his Will, and what is acceptable to Him; for it is in a great meaſure inſcribed in his Soul: 3. Of being a fit Subject to Him, and to obey Him: 4. Of loving and truſting in Him: 5. Of glorifying of Him, eſpecially in the Contemplation of His Works, which are propoſed to his Senſe and Underſtanding: 6. Of Invoking and Worſhipping: And 7. Finally, to enjoy the Bleſſed Viſion of Him, by reaſon of the congruity of his Immortal and Intellectual Nature to ſuch a fruition. And thus we have him in his Duty, Religion; and in his Happineſs, Immortal Life.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:64147:40"/>2. To the reſt of mankind he is accommodated with Moral principles inherent in his Nature, and improvable by the exerciſe of his Faculties, as is before ſhewn; he is accommodated with Speech and Intellectual ſigns to maintain intercourſe and mutual communion and commerce; and his very diſpoſition and the mutual neceſſitudes of humane Nature ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily maintain mutual offices and correſpondence between them; and the accommodations of Government and Laws are the fruit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of his Intellectual nature, and the ſupport of ſociety.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the reſt of the viſible World; there is an admirable accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the humane Nature and Faculties to the <hi>Mundus aſpectabilis,</hi> and of the ſeveral parts of it, and of them to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the Faculties of the humane Nature to the viſible Univerſe, eſpecially the vegetable and animal Natures, which by means of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable advantage of his Intellect, and that ſingular Engin of the Hand, he hath skill and power to ſubdue and bring under, whereby he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth dominion over them and protection of them, as the Vicegerent and Deputy of Almighty God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the Univerſe and parts thereof to the humane Nature and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which were infinite to enumerate; I ſhall only inſert ſome of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A kind of awful ſubjection and fear of the greateſt part of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Nature, of him and to him; and though ſome be ſo hardy and unruly as to reſiſt him, yet he wants not power by the advantage of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Hand to ſubdue and maſter them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An accommodation of moſt of the things within the compaſs of the viſible Univerſe to his uſe and convenience, which though I cannot ſay it is the only or the prime end of their being, yet they are ſingularly accommodated to the uſe, delight and benefit of mankind, as might eaſily appear by an enumeration of particulars: The light, motion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Sun and Stars; the nature, poſition and frame of Elements; the variety and concurrence of the Meteors; the fertility of the Land; the poſition of the Ocean; the interſperſion of the Rivers; the various Minerals, Vegetables and Animals, ſome ſerving for his food, ſome for his clothing; ſome for his labour and travel; ſome for his delight; the whole compaſs of Nature affording infinite variety of Inſtances of this kind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An admirable accommodation of all the things in the World to his Faculties, and for their delight, advancement and improvement. He hath the perception of Senſe, to which all the viſible Objects of the World are preſented, and he hath the light and ſearching Faculty of his Underſtanding, which as it is qualified for ſuch an employment of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, ſo it hath a fruitful exhibition of Objects of great variety and excellency, the knowledge whereof doth not only delight and enrich his Faculties, but are ſo many manuductions to the knowledge and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the infinite Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs of the Creator and Upholder of them.</p>
               <p>And thus I have given a ſhort and brief eſtimate of the peculiar Excellencies of the Humane Nature: I did not deſign a large or exact enumeration or deſcription of them; There is not any one particular above-mentioned but would take up the buſineſs of a juſt Volume, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64147:40"/>
I am eaſily conſcious that I have omitted many things that poſſibly might be of as great importance as any that I have mentioned: But this brief Inventory I have here given as preparatory to what follows, and to pre-poſſeſs the Reader, 1. That a natural Indagation according to the light of natural Reaſon touching the Origination of ſuch a Creature as this, is no contemptible or unworthy enquiry: 2. That ſurely ſuch a Creature as this thus accommodated could not have his Origination from any leſs than an Intellectual, moſt Wiſe, Powerful and Beneficent Being, the great God, Creator and Governour of Heaven and Earth: And this is the ſcope and end of my buſineſs in this Tract, the ſhort <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopſis</hi> whereof is as followeth.</p>
               <p>There are two grand Opinions among the Ancients touching the Origination of Man: The firſt is, That Humane <hi>Species</hi> had no beginning, but was Eternal; the ſecond, That it had a beginning.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I examin the ſuppoſition of the Eternity of Mankind in their ſucceſſive Generations: And in order thereunto I take up the conſideration of the Eternity of the World as it is now conſtituted, and, whether it be in Nature poſſible that it ſhould be ſo: I then deſcend to the particular conſideration of the Eternity of Mankind, whether al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there ſhould be a poſſibility of an eternity of ſome permanent created Beings, whether yet there be a poſſibility in Nature, or any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of evidence that Mankind can be eternal <hi>à parte ante,</hi> or without beginning.</p>
               <p>This I oppoſe by Arguments of two kinds; 1. From the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy in Nature of ſucceſſive Beings to be without an inception, or eternal, and upon theſe kind of evidences I do indeed lay the principal weight and ſtreſs of my Concluſion, becauſe though theſe kind of Arguments may ſeem more obſcure, yet upon a due conſideration of them they are highly conſequential and concludent to my purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of evidences are Moral evidences, wherein I take into conſideration moſt of thoſe Moral evidences that have been collected by others or thought of by my ſelf againſt the Eternity of Mankind: Whereupon I do conclude, 1. That ſingly and apart many of them are ſubject to exception, yet collectively they make up a good moral evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence touching a temporary inception of the humane Nature: 2. I do conſider the particular deficiencies of thoſe moral evidences taken ſingly and apart: 3. I ſubſtitute other moral evidences that even ſingly and apart have each of them a great moral and topical evidence of this truth and are not capable of any conſiderable Objection againſt them, though taken <hi>ſigillatim</hi> and apart.</p>
               <p>But when all is done, I lay the great ſtreſs of my Concluſion upon the firſt ſort of Evidences natural, or metaphyſical, which ſeem to me no leſs than demonſtrative; and therefore if no other moral evidences were added thereunto, or if thoſe moral evidences ſhould be capable of exception (as ſome of them are) yet the truth of the Concluſion againſt the eternity of Mankind is ſufficiently ſupported by thoſe that I offer in the firſt place, which I call Phyſical and Metaphyſical.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, I then come to conſider that Opinion which ſuppoſeth an Inception of the Humane Nature.</p>
               <p>I conſider the various <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> that the Ancients entertained touching the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64147:41"/>
manner of that Origination, and ſhew the abſurdity of them in their ſeveral orders.</p>
               <p>I then conſider the Moſaical <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and the great reaſonableneſs thereof upon a bare Natural or Moral accompt, without taking in the Infallibility of Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p>In order to that, I conſider the whole Moſaical Syſteme or Hiſtory of the Creation of the World, the admirable congruity it hath, both with it ſelf, and with a due and unprejudiced and conſiderate Reaſon.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, I deduce certain Corollaries or Conſequences from the whole Diſcourſe, both Theoretical and Moral, and this is in effect the whole Method of what theſe Papers contain: Wherein I proceed meerly upon an account of Natural Reaſon and Light, becauſe in this Diſcourſe I deal with ſuch as are either only or moſt commonly guided and governed by ſuch Sentiments, and therefore I do not call in to my aſſiſtance the Authority of Divine Revelation, though that of it ſelf doth and ought to carry the full and unqueſtionable Aſſent of all good Men that are acquainted therewith.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. III.</hi> A brief Conſideration of the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> that concern the Eternity of the World.</head>
               <p>ALthough I intend not a large Diſcourſe touching their Suppoſitions that hold the Eternity of the World, yet it will be convenient a little to conſider it, for the better application of what follows in the enſuing Diſcourſe, touching the Eternity of the Succeſſions of Mankind, and the poſſibility or impoſſibility thereof.</p>
               <p>The Suppoſition of the Eternity of the World is conſiderable under a double relation: 1. With relation to the Notion of Eternity: 2. With relation to the Subject it ſelf, which they would have eternal, namely, the World, either wholly or in ſome parts thereof.</p>
               <p>In relation to Eternity it ſelf, two things are to be premiſed: 1. What it is; 2. What its Kinds are. 1. As to the former, in all this Diſcourſe I call that Eternal which is without beginning, or eternal <hi>à parte ante.</hi> 2. Things thus ſuppoſed Eternal may be of two kinds, either ſuch as have an Eternity ſimply independent upon any thing without it, or from which it ſhould derive that Eternal Being, as we and all good Men ſay that Almighty God is Eternal: Or elſe, ſuch an Eternity as yet ſuppoſeth its dependence upon Almighty God as its Cauſe. And they that attribute the firſt kind of Eternity to the World, muſt do it upon one of theſe two grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no other firſt Being, no firſt Cauſe, no God, upon whom the World ſhould depend, or from whom it ſhould derive this its Eternal Exiſtence: And this is the groſſeſt and moſt irrational Suppoſition, as well as the fouleſt Atheiſm, that can be imagined. Or elſe, That although there be in truth ſuch a Being as God, yet the World had not this its Eternal Exiſtence by any derivation or influx from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64147:41"/>
Him, but hath it abſolutely and independently. This is the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Atheiſm, which though it oppoſe the Eternity of the World in that conſiſtency that now it hath, yet it aſſerts the Eternity of thoſe ſmall and infinite particles of Matter, and the coalition of them into that ſtate wherein they now are in proceſs and ſucceſſion of time and motion, yet without any dependence of the one or the other upon Almighty God, whom he totally ſecludes from the concerns of the World.</p>
               <p>Others there are again, that attribute an Eternity to the World, but yet withall acknowledge Almighty God, and alſo Him to be the Efficient thereof: And therefore though they attribute an Eternity to it, yet it is but a dependent Eternity, and ſo though it be Eternal, yet it is but an Eternal Effect of an Eternal Cauſe. Theſe are much more tolerable than either of the former, for they aſſert a God, and likewiſe the dependence of the World in its Eternal Exiſtence and Duration upon Almighty God, as the Cauſe and Root of that Being of the World.</p>
               <p>But among thoſe that thus aſſert this dependent Eternity of the World upon Almighty God as its Cauſe or Efficient, there ſeems to be two Parties, namely, 1. Such as ſuppoſe Almighty God the Neceſſary Cauſe of the World as his Neceſſary Effect. 2. Such as ſuppoſe Him meerly the Voluntary Cauſe of the World and of its Eternity. Of the former ſort, that ſuppoſe Almighty God the Neceſſary Cauſe of the World and of its Eternal Exiſtence, there ſeem to be theſe two Parties or different Opinions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as ſuppoſe the World a meer natural and neceſſary Emanation from God as its neceſſary Cauſe, without any manner of intrinſecal free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Himſelf to do or be otherwiſe, and conſequently it being a neceſſary and connatural Effect of the firſt Cauſe, it muſt be neceſſarily as ancient as Himſelf, and if Almighty God be (as He is) moſt neceſſarily, ſo upon the ſame neceſſity He is the Cauſe of the World, and the World a neceſſary, and conſequently Eternal, Production neceſſarily flowing from the ſame; as if the Sun be Eternal, his Light, which neceſſarily flows from the Exiſtence of the Sun, is likewiſe neceſſarily Eternal. This ſeems to be the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and ſome others that follow him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again ſome there have been, who will not have Almighty God to be a meer natural and neceſſary Cauſe of the World, but ſuch a Cauſe as is a free Agent, <hi>agens per intellectum &amp; voluntatem,</hi> and that the World was an Effect of Him, not as a natural or neceſſary, but as a voluntary and free Agent: And yet the World was neceſſarily Eternal, though freely willed to be Eternal. For they do ſuppoſe, that in as much as God Almighty is neceſſarily Good and Wiſe, and it is part of his Perfection to will what is beſt, and always to will it, therefore the Divine Will was always determined, even eternally, to will the Exiſtence of the World, as a thing eternally conſonant to the Perfection of his Nature, to will and always to will what is beſt: And there was never, in all the vaſt and boundleſs Period of Eternity, any one moment wherein he willed not to communicate his own Benignity and Bounty to ſomething without Him; and therefore though he freely willed the World to be, as a free Agent, yet that freedom of his Will was from all Eternity determin'd, by the Perfect Goodneſs and Beneficence of his Nature, ever to will what He once willed, and conſequently to will the World to be Eternally: Herein confounding the Divine Goodneſs with the Divine Beneficence
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64147:42"/>
and Benignity, the former being indeed neceſſary, but the latter under the Conduct and Guidance of his Free Will, indetermined by any thing but it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Others there are that attribute the Being of the World to the meer <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neplacitum voluntatis divinae,</hi> neither determined as a meer Natural cauſe, nor determined by any intrinſecal obligation of his own Goodneſs; but only that he willed it becauſe he willed it, though moſt wiſely and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully: Many of theſe do not indeed conclude the World to have been eternal, but in conformity to the truth of the Sacred Scriptures conclude it to be created in the beginning of time, but yet do again conclude that there is nothing in the nature of the thing either on the part of Almighty God, or on the part of the World it ſelf, or on the part of the manner of its Creation which is inſtantanous and <hi>per modum ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis;</hi> but that ſuch parts of the World at leaſt as have a permanent exiſtence, and are not in a flux of ſucceſſion, might have been not only in ſome period antecedent to that point of time wherein <hi>de facto</hi> it was created, but alſo that it might have been thus eternally created if the Divine <hi>beneplacitum</hi> had ſo pleaſed: And therefore many of thoſe do not conclude that it was ſo, but that it might have been ſo eternally created, yet freely and voluntarily without any of the two foregoing neceſſities. Thus <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quinas, Suarez</hi> and ſome others.</p>
               <p>And thus having conſidered theſe various ſuppoſitions touching the divers qualities or qualifications of this eternal Exiſtence of the World, I ſhall now conſider the ſubject Matter which men would thus have to be eternal, or at leaſt poſſible to be ſuch, namely the World. And herein even many of the aſſertors of the Eternity of the World, or the poſſibility thereof, have (and not without cauſe) faln into divers conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>By the World therefore we muſt underſtand either the Matter of the World ſimply in it ſelf, without being determined to this determinate Fabrick wherein it is; and thus it ſhould ſeem that all thoſe ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers that have aſſerted the Eternity of the World, as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and before him <hi>Otellus Lucanus:</hi> or, that have aſſerted <hi>novitatem mundi in hac conſtitutione,</hi> have agreed; thus <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that aſſerts the coalition of Atoms into this Fabrick that we ſee, was of later edition than Eternity, yet aſſerts that theſe Atoms were eternal: and thoſe Ancients mentioned by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of his <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> that held that the World was made, and unmade and made again by eternal viciſſitudes of <hi>Amor &amp; Inimicitia,</hi> yet held the conſtituent Matter thereof eternal. And this ſeems to be the moſt comprehenſive acceptation of the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, by the World we may underſtand the World as it is now framed, the viſible World in that form and conſtitution as it now is: And thus it ſeems, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and thoſe others that hold it proceeds neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily from God as a neceſſary cauſe, or as a cauſe determined by his intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Goodneſs, have held the World to be eternal; but yet we muſt not reſt here. The World is like a goodly Palace, a fair large Building; but as in ſuch a Palace there is firſt the caſe or fabrick or <hi>moles</hi> of the Structure it ſelf, and beſides that there are certain additaments that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to its ornament and uſe; as various Furniture, rare Fountains and Aqueducts, curious Motions of divers things appendicated to it, as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64147:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Clocks, Engins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo in the goodly Univerſe there are the great Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture it ſelf, and its great integrals the Heavenly and Elementary Bodies, framed in ſuch a poſition and ſituation, the great Sceleton, as I may call it, of the World: But beſides this there are very various and curious furnitures and accommodations of the Univerſe, as for inſtance, in our inferior World various Animals, Vegetables, Meteors, Minerals, Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Men; and in the Heavenly Bodies various Motions and Aſpects.</p>
               <p>Now it will be neceſſary for him that aſſerts the Eternity of the World as now it ſtands, or the poſſibility of ſuch an eternity, to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he applies his aſſertion to the whole World, as conſiſting not only of the greater integrals whereof it conſiſts, as the Heavenly and poſſibly the Elementary Bodies; but alſo of that furniture thereof conſiſting of Men, Animals, Vegetables, Meteors, Minerals, and thoſe accommodations that are to it, as the Motions of the Heavenly Bodies; or whether he intends only ſome parts of it which ſeem more capable of an eternal exiſtence, as being more fixed, and in themſelves permanent, and ſo more able to ſuſtain an eternal and conſequently an immutable exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</p>
               <p>And upon examination we ſhall <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> find either of theſe choices full of incurable difficulties, if not utter impoſſibilities, in relation to an eternal exiſtence of the World or any parts thereof.</p>
               <p>And this I ſhall in the order of this Diſcourſe evince againſt all thoſe former ſuppoſitions of Eternity; namely, 1. Againſt thoſe that aſſert an independent eternal exiſtence of the World: 2. Againſt thoſe that aſſert an eternal but dependent exiſtence thereof upon Almighty God, as a meer natural and neceſſary Cauſe thereof: 3. Againſt thoſe that aſſert an eternal exiſtence of the World dependent upon God as a free intellectual and voluntary Agent, but yet determined in his external emanations by the neceſſity of the Goodneſs and Beneficence of his nature: 4. Againſt thoſe that aſſert at leaſt a poſſibility of an eternal exiſtence of the World, but dependent upon the freedom of the Divine Will unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the neceſſity of his Beneficence.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore concerning the ſuppoſition of the Eternity of the World in general; I ſhall not in this place diſpute whether there be an utter impoſſibility of any material Being to be either independently or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently eternal; enough may be ſaid againſt it from the incapacity of any material Being to ſuſtain ſuch a kind of duration <hi>à parte ante,</hi> and yet without any derogation to the Divine Omnipotence or Goodneſs, which though infinite, yet cannot communicate ſuch a duration to that which in its own intrinſick nature is not capable of it: Nor ſecondly, ſhall I diſpute whether there be any ſuch material or corporeal Being or Beings within the compaſs of the Univerſe, that hath or may have ſuch a kind of permanence or fixedneſs in being that may be capable of an eternal exiſtence <hi>à parte ante,</hi> either dependently or independently upon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; admitting by way of argument, but not granting it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that in the nature of the thing ſome material or corporeal Being may be of ſuch a fixed, permanent conſiſtence as may ſuſtain ſuch an eternal exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; and I here omit this diſpute not becauſe I make the leaſt doubt of the beginning thereof by Creation, but becauſe theſe are matters that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64147:43"/>
require a longer and ſtricter proceſs of enquiry and debate than I intend in this place: and therefore I ſhall deſcend to things that are more plain and evident, and yet ſuch as will abundantly ſerve my deſign in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry in hand.</p>
               <p>And therefore for the preſent I ſhall <hi>gratia argumenti</hi> admit or ſuppoſe, 1. That there are or may be ſome corporeal things in the compaſs of the Univerſe that may poſſibly be of ſuch a fixedneſs, ſtability and permanent nature that may ſuſtain an eternal exiſtence, at leaſt dependently upon the ſupreme Cauſe. 2. And that poſſibly Matter it ſelf undetermined to any particular form, or under any particular conſtitution; the Heavenly Bodies, the Elementary Bodies, and ſuch as ſeem to have a ſimple nature; and poſſibly their figure, poſition, and ſituation may be ſuch as might have this eternal exiſtence, as the Sun, the Stars, the <hi>Aether,</hi> the four Elements; we will, for avoiding diſpute touching it for the preſent, admit them to have been, or that poſſibly they might have been of that nature, quality, diſtance each from other eternally as now they are, like the great integrals and contignations, figure and concamerations of a goodly Palace: Theſe things I ſay, though in themſelves moſt certainly untrue, I ſhall for avoidance of difficult diſputes admit at preſent. Yet I farther ſay, that though all theſe things were admitted, yet there are ſome great and conſiderable parts and integrals, and appendications unto the <hi>Mundus aſpectabilis</hi> that we ſee, that are purely impoſſible to be eternal, and do <hi>de facto</hi> appear ſo to be; and conſequently it is apparent that the World in its full latitude and comprehenſion cannot be eternal.</p>
               <p>And herein I ſhall not fix upon little or inconſiderable things, but upon ſuch as highly contribute to the excellency, beauty and uſefulneſs thereof; neither ſhall I fix upon individuals which are apparently tranſient, and neceſſarily have their beginning, duration and end in certain known determinate portions of time, as is evident in the individuals of all kinds or <hi>ſpecies</hi> of mixed, ſublunary Natures: But I ſhall apply my ſelf to the <hi>ſpecies</hi> themſelves, which moſt that aſſert the eternity of the World aſſert to be eternal, or to ſuch individuals as are the ſingle Conſervators of their own <hi>ſpecies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this debate I ſhall take my meaſure from things in Nature as I find them; and it is reaſonable I ſhould do ſo, eſpecially conſidering that this Diſcourſe concerns principally the Judgments or Opinions of thoſe men that are the great aſſertors of Nature, and the eternity of thoſe Laws, Rules, Orders, or Methods of Nature which they now find and obſerve in it: And it were a great vanity and raſhneſs eſpecially for ſuch men to reject thoſe reaſons which are drawn from the nature of things as now they appear, or for them to go about to anſwer thoſe reaſons by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of a variety in things from what they now appear. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtate and method of things to be inſtanced in, as they now appear, do involve a repugnancy to an eternal exiſtence, the Arguments drawn from that Suppoſition muſt be concluſive, at leaſt to thoſe great Prieſts and Venerators of Nature and its appearances.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things therefore that I would inſtance in, as in their own nature uncapable of eternal exiſtence <hi>à parte ante,</hi> are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. All things that are of all hands agreed to be concreted of other things, and neceſſarily in their own nature require a pre-exiſtence of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64147:43"/>
thoſe more ſimple Bodies out of which they are concreted, and a pre-exiſtence of ſome preparatory antecedent motion for their coalition, mixtion and concretion; as Animals, Vegetables, Minerals, Meteors, and regularly all mixt Bodies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All things that are in their own nature ſucceſſive, as all Motion, Alteration, Generations, Corruptions, and all things that in their own conſtitution have as it were intrinſecally annexed to them, or at leaſt neceſſarily belonging to them in reſpect of their ſituation and poſition, and juxta-poſition to other things, a neceſſary ſubjection to alteration or corruption.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All things that do not, nor (their nature conſidered) cannot perſiſt in one immutable ſtate, but have variety in the nature and manner of their exiſtence neceſſarily by the laws of their nature annexed to them.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſtituted and being in that ſtate we find them, cannot without a total alteration of their nature and being from what in truth they are, nor in the ſtate of nature wherein they are placed, can they be eternal or without beginning: And theſe are very conſiderable and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous parts or appendices of the World, and if it had been eternally without theſe, it had been a very lame and defective World, and ſuch as the wiſeſt man under Heaven could hardly underſtand for what uſe it would be, or why it ſhould have continued in ſuch a defective con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from the endleſs period of Eternity: Or at leaſt if it had its uſe and beauty, certainly it had not had the ſame uſe that now it hath, nor the ſame beauty that now it hath.</p>
               <p>And the conſequence thereof is of great moment and importance, <hi>viz.</hi> If theſe great acceſſions to the World, whereof I am ſpeaking, could not be eternal, and yet without them the World would have been greatly deficient from what it is, the greateſt Arguments for the Eternity of the reſt of the World will neceſſarily fall off: for the ſame reaſon that concludes for the neceſſity of an eternal exiſtence of the World, would as effectually conclude for the eternal exiſtence of that which highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to the beauty, uſe, and ends of the Univerſe, which yet we ſhall find cannot be eternally exiſting; as it concludes for the eternity of ſuch integrals of the World which poſſibly might be eternal. Again, if it be inconſiſtent with the nature of many of thoſe things eternally to be, which yet contribute much to the glory, beauty, uſefulneſs and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the World, as mixt Bodies, motion, and alteration; how can we think that there is a neceſſity in the Divine Nature to have made that Caſe or Sceleton of the World from eternity which ſhould have been in ſo great a meaſure uſeleſs, and wanting that beauty, order, uſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which it obtains from the contribution of mixt Bodies, motions, and alterations? And what could be thought a ſufficient motive to have had an eternal Carcaſs of an Univerſe wherein the materials and poſitions of it were eternally laid together, and to conſiſt infinite millions of Ages; and yet that which gives it its beauty and ornament and uſe, at leaſt in a great meaſure, muſt be brought to a beginning five, or ſix, or ten thouſand years ſince, and not before? The nearneſs or novity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is neceſſarily required in theſe great contributions to the beauty and uſe of the Univerſe is a great evidence of the novity of all the reſt:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64147:44"/>
And therefore although the Houſe muſt be built ſome time before it be furniſhed, and the Watch muſt be made, the materials formed, adapted and fitted, and the whole put together before it be put in motion; yet it were unneceſſary and vain to ſuppoſe the Caſe or Fabrick of the Houſe, or the Fabrick and Compoſition of the Watch, were an infinite time before its furniſhing and ſetting into motion.</p>
               <p>But to the buſineſs it ſelf, and the Inſtances above given:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſeems inconſiſtent with the Nature of mixed Bodies that they ſhould be eternal, for then they muſt be as ancient as thoſe ſimple Bodies out of which they are taken.</p>
               <p>That there are in our inferior World divers Bodies, that are concreted out of others, is beyond all diſpute. We ſee it in the Meteors; the Clouds are attracted out of moiſt and watry, and alſo earthy Vapours; Stones and Minerals do grow and ariſe in the Earth, out of the <hi>ſuccus terreſtris</hi> digeſted by the heat of the Sun: Divers Vegetables, and ſome Animals, <hi>ſponte nata,</hi> ariſe from the temperament of the terreſtrial and watry Matter, the inſinuations of the <hi>Aether</hi> and Air into it, and the influence of the Sun: Other Animals, and ſome Vegetables, have a more regular production from Seed, as ſome of the perfecter ſort of Vegetables, and the nobler Animals, and Men; which ſeminal Principle is a mixture of the divers particles of Matter and Spirits, derived and elicited from the Plant or Animal.</p>
               <p>And as it is apparent, that there are ſuch mixt Concretions, ſo it is apparent, that before the actual concretion of theſe mixt Bodies there muſt be pre-exiſtent to it: 1. The Matter, or more ſimple Bodies out of which they are concreted: Again, 2. There muſt be antecedent to it that Ethereal or Solar heat, that muſt digeſt, influence, irradiate, and put theſe more ſimple parts of Matter into motion and coalition: And 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the full and perfect formation of this concrete, there muſt be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and digeſtion, and formation of this Matter, before it come into a perfect Concrete, be it of what kind ſoever; and this preparation, digeſtion, and formation, requires a competent <hi>mora,</hi> or time, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to its complete and full conſtitution. All theſe are evident, in a more ſpecial and eminent manner in the production of Animals and Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, but I ſhall at preſent take the Inſtance, that is obvious every day in our Gardens, in the production of a common Flint or Pebble: Firſt, there is the more ſimple Matter, out of which it borrows its ſubſtance, namely, the Earth, and the Water or Moiſture; then there is the heat of the Sun, that digeſts and concocts both; then there is the conjunction and coheſion of the Matter into a more looſe, or indigeſted and ſofter conſiſtency like Mortar or Clay, and thereby it is prepared to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of a Pebble or Flint, which poſſibly in a week or a month it perfectly obtains. Every Man muſt needs ſee, that in the natural courſe of things this Pebble doth ſuppoſe, as pre-exiſtent to it, the more ſimple Matter out of which it is deſumed, the heat and influence of the Sun, and the due preparation of the Matter; which takes up a competent time, and that neceſſarily, before this Pebble had its complete Being: And conſequently, in the courſe of Nature, it is impoſſible that any Pebble was eternal, for it neceſſarily required theſe things to have been before it could be, and yet if it were eternal, it muſt have been as ancient as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64147:44"/>
that Earth, and that Water, which was its material conſtituent, and as that Sun, whoſe heat digeſted it, or coagulated it, or as that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which preceded its conſiſtence.</p>
               <p>And though this Inſtance be of one Individual, and that of the baſeſt nature, yet the very ſame reaſon holds in all mixed Bodies, as in Meteors, Comets, Minerals, Vegetables, Animals, their Seeds and Productions. The conſequence of this is, that it is impoſſible that mixed or compounded Bodies can be eternal, becauſe there is neceſſarily, according to the Rules of Nature, a pre-exiſtence of the ſimple Bodies out of which they are deſumed, and an antecedence of their conſtitution preceding the exiſtence of mixed Bodies.</p>
               <p>If any Man ſhall object againſt this Reaſon, and ſay, That it deſtroyeth my own Foundation, which ſuppoſeth a creation or concrement of thoſe very Bodies which I ſuppoſe to be mixed, as Animals, Vegetables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without all this preliminary proceſs, or orderly antecedency of ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as are now in the courſe of Nature, as it ſtands ſettled, neceſſary to their production: And that, as I do ſuppoſe, all created Beings had at firſt their primitive production by the <hi>Fiat</hi> of the Divine Will and Power, ſo in the defence of that Suppoſition or Concluſion, I muſt ſuppoſe another method of production of mixed Bodies, than what we now find in Nature as it ſtands ſettled.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That it is true, I muſt and do ſuppoſe another kind of method in the firſt and primitive Conſtitution of things by Creation: But it ſtands and conſiſts with, and is conſonant to my whole Suppoſition, and indeed my general Suppoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot poſſibly be or conſiſt without a Suppoſition alſo, That the firſt conſtitution and coalition of mixed Bodies was quite of another frame or method, than what now obtains in ſettled Nature.</p>
               <p>But the Objector muſt conſider againſt whom and what kind of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators the Reaſon above given is levelled, who take all their Meaſures from things as they now ſee them in ſettled Nature, and do thereupon aſſert, That the order and method of the exiſtence and production of all things was eternally the ſame as now it is. And therefore certainly this Reaſon is fully concludent againſt thoſe perſons that would ſuppoſe an Eternity in all things in the World, independent upon the firſt Cauſe and Efficient: For certainly thoſe of their Principles do and muſt needs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that things had no other method of their production than what we now ſee they have, and therefore they muſt (if they hold to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) agree that they had their production always as now they have: The neceſſary conſequence whereof is, that if ſuch a kind of production of mixt Bodies cannot in the nature of the thing be eternal, they cannot have an eternal production.</p>
               <p>But it is true, that this doth not anſwer the Suppoſition of thoſe, that though they ſuppoſe an Eternity in mixt Bodies, do attribute even that Eternity to an eternal Creation, and therefore to another kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction than what we now ſuppoſe to be natural, and conſequently as they ſuppoſe, at firſt in an eternal moment Almighty God created ſimple Bodies, as the Heavenly or Elementary Bodies, ſo in the ſame inſtant He might and did create other Bodies, which though in their conſtitution they were or might be compoſed of ſuch particles, as had they been aſunder
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64147:45"/>
and divided, might have been of the ſimple nature of thoſe ſimpler Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yet they were in the ſame eternal moment or inſtant created and put together without any priority of exiſtence in thoſe ſimple Bodies whereof they might otherwiſe conſiſt; nor were ſuch mixt eternal Bodies ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively deſumed or compounded out of the pre-exiſting ſimple Bodies, but con-created and put together in the ſame eternal and indiviſible moment or inſtant: ſo that a Mineral for the purpoſe might be created in the ſame moment wherein the elementary Earth was created. And although after the completing of the whole Frame of Nature in that eternal, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, intelligible moment, the production of mixt Bodies either by ſpontaneous or contingent coalition of various particles of Matter, or by an univocal generation, the courſe that is now held in Nature might be obſerved, and that Priority of particles of ſimple Matter, Influx of the Heavens, and Preparation of Matter might be antecedent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous not only in order but in time to their ordinary productions; yet at firſt it might be, and was otherwiſe in the primitive conſtitution of ſuch mixt Bodies as had their original by Creation.</p>
               <p>I do confeſs this Suppoſition may evade the illation made upon the Natural production of mixt Bodies, but then we muſt remember that this quite departs from the method of things as they now ſtand in the courſe of Nature; neither can any man conclude that it was or could be ſo from the obſervation of the Order or Cauſe of Nature, or any rational deduction from the ſame, but muſt have recourſe either to bare Notion or Conjecture, or elſe to Divine Revelation; the former ſeems ſomewhat too light, ſoundly to ground any <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> and the latter, namely, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, though it doth diſcover unto us that things had their production in a different way in their firſt Conſtitution or Origination, namely, by the almighty Power of God creating them, yet withall it informs us that that origination was not from Eternity, but in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Time, which wholly overthrows the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of an Eternal Creation of the World: If therefore they will appeal to Revelation for their Creation, they muſt be concluded by it, not to ſay it was eternal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My ſecond Reaſon is this, Becauſe all things that are in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſucceſſive muſt have a firſt beginning of their being, and cannot be eternal. But there are in the World many things of great note and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (and without which the Order and Uſefulneſs of the Univerſe would be deficient) which have a ſucceſſive nature; and therefore ſuch things cannot be eternal or without beginning: And this reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes forcibly as well againſt that independent Eternity ſuppoſed by ſome of the Ancients, as that Eternity dependent upon Almighty God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a neceſſary Cauſe, or as a free voluntary intellectual Cauſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the neceſſary Goodneſs and Beneficence of his nature; or as a perfectly free Agent, determining his Will by his own <hi>beneplacitum</hi> thus eternally to produce the World.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption or minor Propoſition, That there are many things in the World of great moment and importance to it that are in their own nature ſucceſſive, is apparent; ſuch are all the Individuals of <hi>Species</hi> of corruptible things, that yet notwithſtanding have a continued ſucceſſion in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, as Vegetables, Animals, and Men, that ſucceſſively propagate
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64147:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their kind. 2. All kinds of Motions to which all natural Bodies are in ſome kind or other ſubject, as the motions of Generation and Corruption, Augmentation, Diminution, and Alteration that are unceſſantly incident to all ſublunary Bodies, and they muſt change their nature and ceaſe to be what they are, before they can ceaſe to be actually ſubject to alterations; ſuch is alſo Local motion, communicable not only to the inferior and ſublunary Bodies, but alſo to celeſtial Bodies, and this motion even of the Heavenly Bodies themſelves ſeems to be partly continued and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as that motion of the Firſt Moveable; partly interpolated and interrupted, as ſome affirm of that <hi>Motus trepidationis;</hi> ſometimes of acceſs and receſs, as the Annual motion of the Sun, wherein ſome have thought there is a ſmall, though impeceptible, reſt in the very point of returning, which we call Solſtices.</p>
               <p>The major Propoſition, namely, that ſuch ſucceſſive things cannot be eternal, includes two Affirmations, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the motions or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions themſelves cannot be eternal or without beginning: 2. That the things that have neceſſarily and inſeparably theſe motions or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations annexed to their nature cannot be eternal, ſo long as we ſuppoſe them neceſſarily accompanied with theſe alterations: The former of theſe is conſiderable in this place, the other is conſiderable under the next Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now touching the impoſſibility of the eternal ſucceſſion of the <hi>Species,</hi> whether of Men, Animals, or Vegetables by natural propagation or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemination, the ſame and the Reaſons thereof ſhall be fully delivered when we come to the particular conſideration of the Origination of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the neceſſity of fixing in ſome common Parents of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of Mankind, and thither I ſhall refer my ſelf.</p>
               <p>As touching the eternity of any kind of Motion, eſpecially even of that of the Heavenly Bodies, I ſhall ſay ſomewhat briefly in this place which will be eaſily reducible to any other of the motions in the World, as namely the motions of Generation, Corruption or Alteration, all which are in ſome reſpect but the effects of Local motion of one kind or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And there ſeem to be two ſpecial Reaſons even from the intrinſecal nature of the things that encounter the poſſibility of an eternal ſucceſſive duration in them: The firſt concludes againſt all imaginable eternity of Motion of the Heavenly Bodies, whether independent or dependent upon Almighty God; the latter indeed principally concludes againſt the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the created or dependent eternity thereof. And they are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the circular motion of the Sun or Heavens were eternal, then there muſt be two circulations of the Heavens immediately ſucceeding on the other Eternal; the conſequence whereof yet would be, That the one of thoſe circulations would be neceſſarily before the other by the ſpace of twenty four Hours, which would be impoſſible, for then the next ſucceeding circulation would not be ſo ancient as the firſt, and yet both ſhould be eternal, which is impoſſible and repugnant.</p>
               <p>This Reaſon a late Philoſopher hath made uſe of in ſubſtance, but in a different method, namely, That if the circular Motion of the Heaven were eternal, then of neceſſity there muſt be granted ſome one circulation
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64147:46"/>
of the Heaven to be diſtant from us by an interpoſition of infinite Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: This conſequence muſt needs be true, and yet it would perfectly deſtroy infinite Circulation of the Heaven; for it would neceſſarily from hence follow that all the intermediate Circulations were finite, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate on both ends; at this end with that Circulation that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in motion, and <hi>à parte ante</hi> with that Circulation that is ſuppoſed to be infinitely diſtant from us, which excludes any poſſibility of infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in Motions intermediate. And if it be ſaid that the firſt of theſe intermediate Circulations is likewiſe infinitely diſtant from this, then it ſhould be infinitely diſtant and yet the next precedent Circulation ſhould be before it, which deſtroys the very nature and reaſon of infinitude. And if it ſhall be ſaid that that next ſucceeding Circulation after that which is ſo ſuppoſed infinitely diſtant from what is now currant, is diſtant from us by a finite interval, and not infinitely, then that one Circulation which preceded it, and muſt neceſſarily be like ours, and conſequently abſolved in the ſpace of twenty four Hours, ſhall by its acceſſion to a finite number of Circulations, or conſequently to a finite interval of duration, make up an infinite ſucceſſion and an infinite du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the addition of that one antecedent Circulation ſhall make the intermediate finite Circulations infinite, and the addition of a period of twenty four Hours (the uttermoſt extent of one Circulation) ſhall make a finite time or interval infinite, which are intolerable abſurdities, and yet neceſſary conſequences upon the ſuppoſition of the eternal Motion of the Heaven or Sun; or if you will, of the Earth, as the <hi>Copernicans</hi> will have it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Reaſon is this, which though it be but a different and farther explication of the former, yet it renders it clearer and in more perſpicuous terms, which is this: Whatſoever once was and now is not, as it is now paſt, ſo it was once preſent, and before it was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent was future: Take it in the former Inſtance; It is not poſſible that there could have been any Revolution of the Heaven that is now paſt, but that the ſame was once preſent; as whatſoever now is, is neceſſarily whiles it is ſo; whatſoever hath been, was neceſſarily whiles it was; <hi>in praeteritis non eſt contingentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conſequent whereof is, that whiles it is impoſſible but that the remoteſt Revolution of the Heaven once was preſent, That Revolution when preſent, was neceſſarily the <hi>Epocha,</hi> the <hi>terminus</hi> from whence all other ſucceeding Revolutions took the courſe or journey; and yet this remoteſt Revolution could not be of a greater period than 24 Hours, which was not ſufficient to make it eternal, yet all the ſucceeding Revolutions took their riſe and journey from it; and muſt needs be cloſed within two bounds, namely, the moſt remote and the preſent Revolution.</p>
               <p>Again, if it be impoſſible that there can be any Revolution now paſt which was not once preſent, then the moſt remote was once preſent, and at that time when it was ſo preſent had none before it or more ancient than it; and that Revolution being ſuch as now we have, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily have its beginning within the ſpace of twenty four Hours, before which it was not, and conſequently when it was ſo preſent could not be eternal; and conſequently all the Revolutions that ſucceeded came after it, was terminated by it, and by ſuch a Revolution that when it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64147:46"/>
was preſent had a beginning and could not be eternal, nor conſequently all the Revolutions that hapned ſince that firſt, which are <hi>utrinque clauſa,</hi> namely, with that which is remoteſt, and with this that now is in motion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whatſoever bodily Being is created eternally, muſt neceſſarily be created in ſome certain <hi>ſitus</hi> or diſpoſition, and muſt of neceſſity remain an eternal duration in that <hi>ſitus</hi> or diſpoſition wherein it was ſo created. For inſtance, if we ſhould ſuppoſe the Sun created eternally, we muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſuppoſe 1. That he was created in ſome determinate <hi>ubi</hi> or <hi>ſitus,</hi> for that is undiſpenſably neceſſary to every created individual Body; and therefore if he were eternally created we muſt ſuppoſe him created <hi>in tali vel tali plaga mundi,</hi> ſuppoſe we to be above our Horizon, or below it. 2. It muſt neceſſarily be, that in that <hi>ubi</hi> where he was ſo created, that he muſt by an eternal ſpace or duration abide in that <hi>ſitus</hi> or <hi>ubi</hi> where he was ſo created; and he muſt (it is true) have a diſpoſition to motion, but he muſt be <hi>in diſpoſitione tantum ad motum</hi> by an infinite tract of duration: For if we ſhall ſuppoſe that he ſtaid in his <hi>ſitus</hi> of his Creation but an hour, or a day, or a moment, and then ſet out to move, that moment of his exiſtence before he moved would terminate and bound the duration of his motion, which could not be eternal becauſe it had an antecedent moment before it, which ſecludes it from eternity: Neither can we ſuppoſe him to be eternally created in motion, for he muſt be before he can move, and muſt alſo have a <hi>terminus motus à quo.</hi> But ſuppoſe we might imagin him to be in the very firſt eternal ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable inſtant of his eternal being put into motion, yet the <hi>terminus</hi> of that motion muſt neceſſarily be that <hi>ubi</hi> and <hi>ſitus</hi> wherein he was created, which would neceſſarily be the antecedent circumſcription of the line of his motion; and if the line of his motion hath neceſſarily a <hi>terminus</hi> of its inception, it muſt of neceſſity have a <hi>terminus</hi> of its duration, and cannot be infinite in duration <hi>à parte ante:</hi> And as to this purpoſe there will be no manner of difference between a circular motion and a ſtreight motion, if we could ſuppoſe in the vaſt abyſs of imaginary infinite ſpace there were ſome one determinate point from whence a direct local motion ſhould be ſuppoſed to begin its motion, the line that ſuch a ſtreight motion ſhould make would be finite, and conſequently an infinite time could not poſſibly be conſumed in ſuch a motion. And upon the ſame account if the Sun were created in any point of the Hemiſphere, and then preſently took his ſtart or motion to the Weſt, and ſo onward in his circular journey, it were impoſſible that the line of that motion ſhould be of an infinite extenſion, but being drawn out at length like a clew of thred wound off from a bottom, it would be of a finite extenſion, and conſequently the period of that motion could never be infinite. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us truly, that an infinite time can never be drawn out in a finite motion, nor an infinite motion be abſolved in a finite time: This Reaſon the acute and judicious <hi>Suarez,</hi> 2. <hi>Metaph. diſp.</hi> 29. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. borrows from <hi>Antonius Ruvio,</hi> and though according to the opinion of <hi>Aquinas</hi> he be a ſtiff aſſertor of the poſſibility of the Eternal Creation of the World, <hi>ibid. diſp.</hi> 20. yet he frankly confeſſeth and maintaineth that Motion is of ſuch a nature as is not capable of an eternal duration <hi>à parte ante;</hi> and thereupon concludes, <hi>Propter hanc ergo cauſam existimó
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64147:47"/>
Aeternitatem repugnare Motui, &amp; Motum includere repugnantiam cum quadam immutabilitate, quam includit Aeternitas: Ideoque de facto motum non ſolum non eſſe aeternum, verum neque eſſe poſſe. Igitur ex motu aeterno colligi non poteſt Motor eternus vel immaterialis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now let any Man conſider what is gained by the Suppoſition of an Eternity of the Bulk or Carkaſs of the World, when yet it cannot hold with it in conſort an Eternity of Motion: 1. That we muſt ſeparate from Bodies that which is moſt connatural to them, eſpecially the Heavenly Bodies, and this for an eternal period, 'till put in motion within the limits of time. 2. We ſhall hereby ſeparate from the Body of the Univerſe for an eternal period that which renders it moſt uſeful, and moſt beautiful: To ſuppoſe an Eternal World, and yet eternally deſtitute of Motion, were to ſuppoſe the whole Univerſe deſtitute of Life, and all Vegetables, Animals, Meteors, the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, the whole Furniture at leaſt of this inferiour World, to be none but dead, liveleſs, ſtupid Beings, for ſuch it certainly would be, if the Heavenly Bodies ſhould be deſtitute of their Motion.</p>
               <p>And therefore it ſeems wholly diſagreeing to Reaſon, that the World ſhould be eternal, when it is evident, that Motion (which as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> truly tells us is, <hi>Vita quaedam omnium mobilium)</hi> cannot be eternal, and ſo there ſhould be an eternal uſeleſs Carkaſs of a World from all Eternity, without that life of it, its Motion.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, it ſeems more conſonant to Reaſon, that the Fabrick of the World did not long antecede its Motion, and that ſince Motion is not, cannot be eternal, ſo neither is the Fabrick of the World, but they both began at leaſt very neer together, and the World was not made from Eternity to lye fallow and uninhabited during that infinite abyſs of its pre-exiſtence to its firſt putting forth into any Motion, for ſuch it muſt be, if deſtitute of Motion. And conſequently the evincing of an impoſſibility of an eternal ſucceſſive Motion, doth not only evince, that the whole World, with all its conſiderable Appendices, was not eternal, but doth with great evidence enforce, that the great Integrals of the World it ſelf were not eternal, which had been imperfect without Motion.</p>
               <p>And this doth ſalve two Objections at once, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That drawn from Gods Omnipotence, that could have made the World eternal, if He pleaſed. The Anſwer is: That whatever could have been done in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Reſt of the World, yet as in reference to ſucceſſive Motion the ſame could not have been made eternal, and yet without derogation to the Divine Power or Omnipotence, but becauſe the nature of the thing could not ſuſtain or bear ſuch a duration.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe this anſwers the Argument for the Eternity of the World, drawn from the Divine Benignity and Goodneſs, whereby He is ſuppoſed to be under a kind of intrinſick neceſſity of doing all the good He could, and conſequently to make the World eternally. I anſwer, 1. That as before the World, in its complement and perfection with the advantage of Motion, though there was no determinate time, point, or period, but God might have made it ſooner if He had pleaſed, yet (with all due reverence to His Majeſty) it could not have been in its complement and perfection eternal, becauſe its ſucceſſive Motion could not be eternal, nor
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64147:47"/>
conſequently all that glory, beauty and uſefulneſs which accrues to the Univerſe by that ſucceſſive Motion. 2. That although the Divine Will be determined by the Divine Perfection neceſſarily to will his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Goodneſs, yet he is not determined by his own Benignity neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to will any thing without himſelf; his own eſſential Goodneſs he wills, and that neceſſarily, and <hi>ad ultimum poſſe;</hi> but his Benignity is meaſured out <hi>ad beneplacitum voluntatis,</hi> and not by an abſolute neceſſity <hi>ad ultimum poſſe:</hi> And therefore although it were admitted that he could have eternally made the World, or made more Worlds or better Worlds, yet he was not bound to it, becauſe the emanations of his Benignity are not neceſſary, but governed in their extent and meaſure <hi>juxta volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis beneplacitum.</hi> 3. And upon the ſame account alſo, though he could have made the World ſooner than he made it, yet he was not bound to it, but to make it when and how he pleaſed, though all his Works carry the impreſſion of tranſcendent Wiſdom and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>And therefore as theſe Reaſons ſeem ſtrongly to conclude 1. Againſt the very poſſibility of an eternal duration of thoſe things that gave the principal ornament, beauty and uſefulneſs to the Univerſe, namely, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and Succeſſion of Individuals and <hi>Species,</hi> and Motion, ſo they do, at leaſt <hi>de facto,</hi> evidence that if the reſt of the Univerſe were able to ſuſtain an eternal duration, yet they did not, becauſe theſe would be very defective without thoſe that cannot hold that ſtate of Eternity with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Againſt the truth of that Reaſon and Aſſertion, That Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did intrinſecally neceſſitate his Will to create things in their beſt ſtate from Eternity, ſince it ſeems evident that the condition and ſtate of many things in the Univerſe that give it much of its uſefulneſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and beauty, namely Motion, and Succeſſion of Generations and Corruptions, of Animals, Vegetables and Men, are impoſſible to be as ancient as that intrinſick Goodneſs of the Divine Nature, which is as eternal as his own moſt perfect being.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I come now to the third Reaſon againſt the Eternity of conſiderable parts of the World, which is this; Sublunary Bodies, whether ſimple or mixt, are by the neceſſity of their nature ſubject to alteration and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: But whatſoever is ſubject thus to alteration or corruption, is incapable of ſuſtaining an eternal duration <hi>à parte ante,</hi> and conſequently ſublunary Bodies are not capable of ſuch an Eternity.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Propoſitions, namely, That all ſublunary Bodies are ſubject neceſſarily to alteration and corruption: This naturally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to ſublunary Bodies upon both or one of theſe accounts, 1. From an intrinſecal Cauſe, which is principally ſeen in mixt Bodies, in which the band and ligament between Matter and Form, nor of the parts of Matter themſelves is not ſo ſtrict and tenacious, but that they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily in proceſs of time fall aſunder. Beſides, by the continual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between thoſe contrary qualities bound up together in them, there do ariſe unceſſant alterations, and at laſt final diſſolution of them, even from within themſelves 2. From extrinſecal Cauſes: For the very neceſſary compoſure and poſition of things in the World is ſuch, that there is a vicinity between Agents and Patients, and contrary diſſenting active Qualities, that the one inceſſantly invades the other, and alters,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64147:48"/>
changes, intends, remits and corrupts the other; which perpetual <hi>lucta</hi> is ſeen daily not only in the mixed and compounded Bodies, but even in the more ſimple elementary Bodies, which daily invade, change, alter, and corrupt one the other according to their various degrees of activity, contrariety and vicinity each to other.</p>
               <p>And if the World had been eternal, we muſt ſuppoſe it eternally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of ſuch natures ſo placed and diſpoſed in ſuch ſituation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as now they ſtand, or otherwiſe, we do not reaſon <hi>ad idem,</hi> the World otherwiſe ſhould have been of another make, conſtitution and poſition than now it is; things corruptible muſt have been incorruptible, and the vicinity, activity, contrariety and poſition of things and their natures and qualities muſt otherwiſe have been quite different, and ſo our debate would be transferred quite to another World of another nature and conſtitution from that touching whoſe Eternity we now diſpute.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Propoſition is this, That whatſoever is ſubject to ſuch alteration or corruption cannot poſſibly be eternal, at leaſt unleſs we ſhall wholly remove from it by an infinite duration that corruption or alteration to which it is thus neceſſarily ſubject, and ſo make it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than what indeed it is.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the due and clear explication of this Truth renders the Aſſertion plain in it ſelf, I ſhall diſtinctly examin it; and becauſe we have ſuppoſed that the corruption of things corruptible, and the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of things alterable depends, as before, upon a double Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That intrinſecal defectibility of the connexion or union of the parts of things corporeal, which is rooted in the very Nature of the things themſelves; and 2. From the vicinity of other contrary active Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples endued with contrary active Qualities which mutually invade one another; which poſition (conſidering the Frame and Conſtitution at leaſt of this inferior World, is abſolutely neceſſary, unleſs we ſhall make the World another thing, and of another Fabrick than what it is) as the moiſture of the Water is contiguous to the dryneſs of the Earth, and the heat of the Sun is contiguous to the coldneſs and moiſture of the Water, and cannot be otherwiſe in the Conſtitution of the World as now it ſtands, and conſequently one muſt neceſſarily work an alteration in the other: I ſhall therefore purſue the ſame method, and firſt conſider ſuch Bodies as ſeem to have an intrinſick principle of alteration or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from the diſſolubility of their parts, and the coadunition of ſeveral particles endued with contrary and deſtructive qualities each to other; or ſuch as at leaſt tend to a gradual alteration. And ſecondly, I ſhall conſider ſuch parts of the Univerſe as do mutually act one upon another, and thereby induce corruption or alteration of one by another, according to the prevalency and activity of the one or the other.</p>
               <p>But before I come to either of the particulars I ſhall premiſe ſome things which will be of uſe in all that follows, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That preceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to all Generation of any material Being, according to the courſe of Nature which we ſee, there muſt be a gradual preparation and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the matter before there is a complete generation of any thing: This we ſee in the caſual production of Inſects and Vegetables, and in the natural production of Minerals or Meteors, and in the regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64147:48"/>
of Animals and Men. 2. That in things which yet hold their eſſential conſiſtency, yet there are very many alterations, not only acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, as where things are rarified or condenſed, or made hot from being cold, or cold from being hot, but alſo ſuch as ſeems connatural to the <hi>Species:</hi> Thus we ſee in a Man, firſt he is a weak little Infant, then a Y<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, then a Man, then he becomes an Old Man, and yet continues ſtill a Man till his diſſolution; and to theſe various ſtates of his Age there ſeem to be various alterations accommodate, as difference in ſtature, bigneſs, ſtrength, activity, underſtanding; and the ſame is obſervable in proportion to their capacities in Animals, Vegetables, Minerals, and the like. 3. That theſe alterations are neceſſarily ſucceſſive and gradual, whether they be ſuch as are preparative to Generation or Corruption of Beings, or ſuch as conſiſt with the Exiſtence of the being they have (as thoſe alterations incident to the ſtate of things in their conſiſtency) yet they are not inſtantaneous, but ſucceſſive and gradual; nay thoſe very alterations that are wrought in things by an external contrary Agent, yet they are not in a moment, but gradual and ſucceſſive, which is partly by reaſon of the reſiſtence in the Patient, and partly becauſe the Agent works upon the Patient by a certain local motion of it ſelf or parts, or of its virtue and activity, which cannot be inſtantaneous and <hi>tota ſimul,</hi> but gradual and ſucceſſive: Thus the Sun reduceth the Clay to its final degree of hardneſs, and the Wax to its final degree of ſoftneſs ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively and gradually; the Fire aſſimulates the Stubble, and converts it into Fire, not in an inſtant but by degrees, though ſooner or ſlower ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vicinity of each, and the precedaneous preparations of congruity of the Stubble to be wrought upon by the Fire. 4. That theſe alterations that are thus ſucceſſive and gradual, as they cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inſtantaneous, ſo it is impoſſible they can laſt or continue for an infinite or eternal duration. The reaſon is, becauſe as they muſt have an inception of their motion, ſo they muſt of neceſſity arrive to their complement within the compaſs of time, and can never hold out in their progreſs to an infinite duration: Let us ſuppoſe the Fire and the Stubble to have been created eternally contiguous one to another, the Fire could never have held an infinite duration in conſuming that Stubble, for then it could never have been conſumed; for that which had been burning an infinite time could never be burnt, no not ſo much as any part of it; for if it had burned part after part, the whole muſt needs be abſumed in a portion of time: neither need we labour this, for we ſee that the Fire conſumes Stubble or other combuſtible matter in a ſhort portion of time; and ſince if we talk of an Eternity of the World, or of any thing in it, we muſt in common reaſon ſuppoſe it to be ſuch as now it is, we muſt neceſſarily allow the like properties, activities, natures and operations to things as we find them now have. And ſince we ſee that all bodily alterations are effected in certain portions of meaſured duration or time, we cannot upon any reaſonable account allow to thoſe alterations an infinite antecedent duration; but if any Body or Thing in that imaginary period of Eternity allotted to it had any ſuch alterations as we ſee now are incident to them, they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be of an eternal duration no more than they are now, for that were wholly to alter the ſtate of the World and of thoſe things that are in it.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64147:49"/>
5. And conſequently whatſoever thing it is that hath or can have an eternal being <hi>à parte ante,</hi> muſt perſiſt in that eternal being without any change, alteration or corruption; or if it have any alteration or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the firſt alteration, change or corruption that it can have, muſt be in time, and after an eternal, unchanged, unaltered eſtate precedaneous to ſuch alteration; for if we ſhould ſuppoſe it to be eternal, then of neceſſity that alteration or corruption which it hath, muſt be ſubſequent to that eternal ſtate which it had before it was altered or corrupted, and conſequently muſt have had a perſiſtence in that unaltered, uncorrupted eſtate infinite Ages before ſuch alteration or corruption: If it were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally altered, or eternally corrupted, then it was eternally, and eternally was not; it was eternally without alteration, and eternally altered: The thing muſt be before it can be altered or corrupted, and conſequently its alteration and corruption muſt be ſubſequent and after that exiſtence which it had unaltered or uncorrupted; and conſequently the alteration and corruption muſt needs be younger than that eſtate which it had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altered or uncorrupted, and conſequently cannot be eternal.</p>
               <p>Again, we cannot by any means ſuppoſe that any commencement of alteration in the firſt moment or degree of it could be coeternal to it; for (as is before evident) then that alteration would of neceſſity be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected within the like portion of time as the like alteration is perfected: Now ſuppoſe it were a corruptive alteration, it may be that is perfected in the ſpace of three or ſix months from its firſt inception, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof would be, that the like alteration of that eternal altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or corruptible Body, if it began with the thing it ſelf, would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the like ſpace, <hi>viz.</hi> ſix months: And ſhould that perfected alteration fall within the compaſs of Eternity, or out of it? If it ſhould, then the thing was eternally unaltered and uncorrupted, and was yet eternally altered or corrupted; was eternally, and yet that Eternity was but a ſpace of ſix months, for ſo long only it had its being uncorrupted: If the alteration or corruption was not eternally perfected, but perfected in time, then an addition of ſix months the more of that alteration added unto a finite duration or time ſucceeding after ſuch alteration, ſhould make it infinite and eternal. 6. And yet the ſuppoſition of an eternal ſtate of any corruptible or alterable Being, in a ſtate of incorruption or unalteration, were utterly to change the very nature of things; and to give them an eternal ſtate, we muſt be forced to gratifie them with a nature not only preter-natural to what they had, but quite of a diſtinct nature: For the purpoſe; That man that is even upon the intrinſick conſtitution of his nature diſſolvible, muſt by being in an eternal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration continue immortal, unalterable, and not for a year, or a million or two of years, but for an eternal duration antecedent to his diſſolution: Nay, it is inconceptible how any ſuch man that hath ſtood the ſhock of an eternal duration without corruption or alteration, ſhould after be corrupted or altered: from any internal principle of corruption or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it could not be, for then he could never have ridden out an eternal period; but it muſt be, if at all, by the power of a more powerful Being than himſelf, that muſt violently <hi>de novo</hi> introduce his change and diſſolution. The Suppoſition therefore of an eternal exiſtence of any thing corruptible, is to alter their very nature, and make that to be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64147:49"/>
incorruptible which is corruptible. And to ſuppoſe that imaginary eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate of things corruptible, to be utterly of another nature, kind, and condition than what we now ſee them to be, which is an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Suppoſition, unworthy of an admirer of Nature, which ſhould be conſtant in his Suppoſition, and yet is the neceſſary conſequence of the granting of an Eternity of corruptible Beings. But particular Inſtances of the ſeveral kinds of alterations and corruptions of things either <hi>ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſeco</hi> or <hi>ab extrinſeco,</hi> will make the thing more plain.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching things alterable or corruptible from an intrinſecal Cauſe, as Vegetables, Animals, Men. If any Vegetables were eternal, as an Oak, or an Elm, then ſome Oak was eternal; if it were, then if it were of the ſame nature as Oaks are now, it was firſt a ſlender Plant, and then gradually grew to his juſt dimenſions, perhaps in two hundred years, and in about two hundred years more decayed, and was corrupted to duſt; ſo that his duration exceeded not four hundred years, and in that period of time he grew perchance from an inch in diameter to ſix foot in diameter, and from a foot high to a hundred foot high: Theſe alterations and augmentations were gradual and ſucceſſive; he was not in the ſame moment one inch and ſix foot in the diameter, nor in the ſame moment was a Plant and diſſolved and turned to duſt; and yet if this Oak were eternal in all this portion of his duration, he muſt be eternally one inch in diameter, and yet eternally ſix foot in diameter; eternally one foot high, and yet eternally a hundred foot high, he muſt have eternally been a Plant, eternally a Tree, and yet eternally corrupted; his duration muſt have laſted but four hundred years, and yet he muſt be eternal, though his firſt being were but four hundred years before utter diſſolution: And yet it is moſt certain that this Tree could not have been eternal; for being but of four hundred years ſtanding, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what muſt have anteceded that period, and ſo ſomewhat more ancient than what had been eternal.</p>
               <p>But let us ſuppoſe this eternal Oak had not been bound to the laws of duration of other Oaks, but to have laſted eternally, and probably would have laſted to this day, had not external force either violently or accidentally corrupted or deſtroyed him; yet did this Oak ever grow bigger or taller than what he once was, or did he put off his leaves in the Winter, and gather others in the Spring? Did he put forth new branches, which before he had not? If he did none of theſe things, ſurely he was not a vegetable Being, he was not like thoſe Oaks that are now growing, but quite of another nature, and we have nothing to do with him, he is a perfect ſtranger to this World: If it did grow from leſſer to greater, and did put forth new branches, certainly the increment could not be eternal, but muſt be done gradually and ſucceſſively, and from one degree of bigneſs to another; and ſince that augmentation could never be of an infinite procedure, but being ſucceſſive, we muſt come to the beginning of that increaſe within the meaſure of ſuch a portion of time as we now find ſufficient for ſuch a production or increaſe, it may be two or three hundred years, which being but a finite duration can never be eternal: And this neceſſary Suppoſition of a ſucceſſive alteration or increaſe, utterly deſtroys the poſſibility of an eternal duration in any thing capable of ſuch alterations; 1. Becauſe it neceſſarily ſuppoſeth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64147:50"/>
ſomewhat precedent to that ſtate wherein it is, namely, a precedent alteration of it, whereby it is now become what it now is, and what before it was not; ſo that it had ſomewhat before its preſent ſtate which ſtateth it to be what it now is, namely, that alteration or augmentation which ſo preceded its preſent ſtate, and conſequently that preſent ſtate wherein it is, could not be eternal, for it had ſomewhat before it. 2. Becauſe that very alteration that anteceded that ſtate which it hath cannot poſſibly be eternal, but muſt be perfected within a certain portion of time deſtined to it, and conſequently muſt have beginning within the compaſs of a determinate time, and cannot be eternally moving to its accompliſhment.</p>
               <p>And as this Inſtance gives the impoſſibility of an eternal Exiſtence in any thing eſſentially alterable or corruptible, ſo it would be poſſibly more conſpicuous in the Contemplation of the Humane Nature: If we ſhould ſuppoſe a Man to have been eternal, Was that Man ever an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo,</hi> a Child, a Youth, a ripe Aged Man? Did he grow from a ſmaller ſtature to a greater, had he viciſſitudes of temperaments and diſtempers, did he eat, digeſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If he did not, then thoſe eternal Men were not of the ſame Make with the Men that are now, but quite another thing, which we know not what it was, or where to find it: But if he had all thoſe changes he could not be eternal, he ſhould be eternally a Child and eternally a Man, eternally young and eternally old, yea eternally living and yet eternally dead; for all theſe muſt fall within the compaſs of Eternity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But let us now conſider how the Caſe falls out in relation to alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and corruptions occaſioned <hi>ab extrinſeco,</hi> and we ſhall find, 1. That as the World is framed, and as thoſe that ſuppoſe it eternal, muſt ſuppoſe it to have been always ſo framed, there muſt neceſſarily be inceſſant mutations, alterations, generations, and corruptions by the invaſion and juxta-poſition of contrary Natures, Agents, Patients, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Motions; the Earth naturally dry is moiſtned by the vicinity of the Water, and again dryed by the heat of the Sun; the Earth obſtructs the fluidity of the Water by mingling its groſſer parts with it; all things as it were in continual motion and agitation, and mutual preying as it were one upon another; which as neceſſarily occaſioneth mutations, alterations, generations and corruptions, as the very intrinſecal diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the natures of mixt Bodies. 2. And as we find this now, ſo we muſt ſuppoſe that this hath been always ſo ſince the World had a being; unleſs we ſhall ſuppoſe, as I have often ſaid, another kind of World than what we ſee: And although we are not acquainted with the ſtate of things out of, or beyond this ſublunary World, in which we ſee this viciſſitude of alterations, yet whether there may not be ſome ſuch mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the Ethereal World, we know not; but there may be ſuch, though we cannot certainly know them. 3. And yet it is moſt certain, that it is impoſſible that any thing that is capable of theſe mutations and changes can be eternally under them, but muſt of neceſſity, if it were eternal, conſiſt in ſuch a ſtate of fixedneſs and permanency that were not obnoxious to theſe changes. 4. And ſince it is not poſſible, for the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior World at leaſt, to be <hi>de facto</hi> one moment of time without theſe changes and variations, alterations, generations and corruptions; which,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64147:50"/>
as before, are not at all conſiſtent with an eternal duration <hi>à parte ante,</hi> of that that is ſo ſubject to changes, we have juſt reaſon to deny and diſeſteem this imaginary Eternity can belong at leaſt to the ſublunary World. The late Author of a Book <hi>De Aetate Mundi</hi> hath given us an Inſtance herein, that if it would hold, we need not go farther; namely, That the great Rocks in the Sea are yet many of them eminently viſible to this day, and yet daily experience ſhews us that thoſe Rocks are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually diminiſhed by the beating of the Sea againſt them; which had they been ſo dealt with from Eternity, though they loſt but one grain in a million of millions of years, they would not have been, but would have been conſumed an indefinite time long ſince elapſed: But the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition fails, becauſe it may be that theſe Rocks have at leaſt viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of increaſe and diminution by the very alluvion of the Sea, or, which ſeems far more eaſily ſuppoſed, that the Earth and Seas might notwithſtanding have been eternal, but yet the Sea might not have kept the ſame Channel where theſe Rocks now are, from eternity, but gained it in time; the Ancients telling us that the great <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea was for the moſt part of it anciently a Continent, or at leaſt a great Iſland as big as <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and after ſwallowed up and corroded into that vaſt Sea called the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, leaving behind it only thoſe reliques now called the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands: I will therefore take my Inſtance in ſome other things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is evident that divers Minerals are bred in the Earth from an earthy conſiſtence, by the heat of the Sun and other concurrent cauſes ſucceſſively, as may appear to any man's obſervation touching Coals, Rocks, eſpecially of Stone, which from a ſandy kind of Earth gradually concoct into Free-ſtone, when they were before Earth, as may be ſeen in many Quarries by thoſe pieces of unconcocted Earth not yet perfectly digeſted into Stone: If the Body of the Earth were eternal, either theſe concretions were alſo as eternal as the Earth gradually and ſucceſſively digeſted into theſe concretions, or elſe the Earth muſt have had an eternal permanency in that ſtate of ſimple natural Earth, without any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions or alterations in it: If we ſhall ſay the latter, we make the Earth another thing than what in truth it now is, which by the aid of the Sun hath theſe concretions and alterations even by a kind of neceſſity of Nature wrought in it: And beſides, if in that portion of eternal duration wherein the Earth and Sun were in that very ſame natural ſtate wherein they now are; the one active, piercing, and digeſtive by its heat; the other paſſive, receptive, and ſtored with materials for ſuch a production. What ſhould hinder but that there ſhould be ſuch production gradually and ſucceſſively prepared, and at length generated by the conjunction of theſe active and paſſive Principles.</p>
               <p>And yet if it be duly conſidered, ſuppoſing the Sun and the Earth to be both eternal, the Earth and its parts muſt of neceſſity perſiſt in an eternal unchangeable ſtate in that period of Eternity antecedent to the firſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration thereof to any ſuch production: For if the production of theſe Minerals ſhould be eternal, and conſequently infinitely diſtant from us, the productions muſt be eternal, and yet there muſt neceſſarily ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede thoſe productions a ſucceſſive and gradual alteration of thoſe parts of the Earth which were to be moulded in ſucceſſion of time to Coals,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64147:51"/>
or Stone, or Minerals: And though perchance that alteration might take up a long preparation and diſpoſition, yet it could not be eternal, but muſt be abſolved, though in a long, yet in finite time; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Earth, if eternal, muſt be before that preparation or alteration, and muſt have continued in an eternal ſtate, deſtitute of ſuch alteration or preparation, and in an eternal diſpoſition thereunto; which yet had been to ſuppoſe the Earth in that eternal period quite deſtitute of that mutation that upon the Suppoſition of the agency of the Sun had been connatural to it. So that upon the whole matter it ſeems plain, That neither ſucceſſive natural Beings, nor corporeal Beings, that are corruptible or neceſſarily ſubject to alteration, either from an intrinſick Principle or from an extrinſick natural Cauſe neceſſarily contiguous or approximate to it in ſituation or virtue, cannot be eternal; which will deprive the greateſt part of the ſublunary World at leaſt of that poſſibility, and muſt leave only ſuch parts of the viſible Univerſe as are incorruptible, unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, and unſucceſſive (if any ſuch be) capable of this priviledge of the very poſſibility of an eternal exiſtence <hi>à parte ante:</hi> And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the whole Univerſe cannot be eternal.</p>
               <p>It remains then, they who aſſert the Eternity of the World muſt content themſelves with ſuch parts thereof as are capable of that duration. And accordingly there ſeem to have been three Opinions, which although they aſſume not the Aſſertion of the Eternity of the whole World, yet they endeavour to come as near to it as they can; which I ſhall diſtinctly ſet down and examin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Opinion is of ſuch, that although they ſuppoſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary World not to be eternal in its Frame and Conſtitution, yet they aſſert the Matter thereof eternal, though undigeſted, and not perfected till afterwards: But yet the Celeſtial or Ethereal World, the Stars and Planets they will have eternal, and that theſe were uſed as the great Engins in the ſubſequent formation of the inferior <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r ſublunary Wor<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d.</p>
               <p>Touching the Eternity of Matter, whether Celeſtial or Sublunary, I mean not in this place to meddle; but as to the Suppoſition of the eternal exiſtence of the Celeſtial or Ethereal World, this ſhall be all I ſhall ſay: 1. We are not acquainted with the Conſtitution of them, and whether they are in their nature corruptible or ſubject to alterations; if they are ſuch, they are as equally uncapable of an eternal exiſtence as the ſublunary World. 2. But ſuppoſe them to have a radical incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility and immutability in their natures, yet their Motion cannot be eternal upon the Reaſons before given. 3. And therefore though they are a goodly Fabrick, yet they are not in a ſtate of Permanency of ſo great uſe, beauty and perfection, as in a ſtate of Motion, which is a great part of their excellency, and that which accommodates the ſeveral parts thereof one to another, and all to the advantage and good of the inferior World; and therefore it ſeems not probable that they ſhould have an eternal exiſtence in Reſt and Permanence, and afterwards in a proceſs or period of time be endued with that which is their great perfection, namely their Motion, which neither was nor could be eternal: It rather ſeems more agreeable to the nature of the thing, and to the Divine Wiſdom, whoſe Works are full of wiſdom, excellence, and perfection, to reſpite the Fabrick till it were capable of its moſt uſeful and beautiful perfection,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64147:51"/>
namely Motion; which muſt either be natural to them, and then it were marvellous they ſhould yet enjoy an infinite duration deſtitute of what was natural to them, and yet not capable to be enjoyed by them in an eternal duration <hi>à parte ante:</hi> Or if it were adventitious from the immediate power of God, or by the inſtrumentality of Intelligences, yet ſurely it was foreſeen by him that knew all his Works from the beginning: and therefore was not likely to ordain an eternal conſiſtence of thoſe Bodies to which he intended to give Motion, their great perfection, not ſooner than time: And therefore though the Heavenly Bodies were admitted capable of an eternal Permanency, yet it is not probable they had their Being before, or at leaſt not ſo long before their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Opinion is of thoſe that although they allow not the <hi>Mundus aſpectabilis</hi> to be eternal, yet do ſuppoſe that beſides that Eternal Generation of the Second, and the Eternal Proceſſion of the Third Perſon of the Sacred Trinity, Almighty God eternally created a World of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, whereunto he might and did communicate the emanations of his Bounty and Benignity, and that in the beginning of Time he Created this <hi>Mundus aſpectabilis</hi> which we ſee, for the farther commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of his Bounty and Goodneſs; and this they ſuppoſe more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and ſuitable to the Order of things, and of his own Goodneſs and the communication thereof, than to ſuppoſe the Creation of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial World either eternally or <hi>quaſi per ſaltum,</hi> or at the ſame time with the Creation of thoſe purer Beings, who had a greater ſimilitude and proximity to his own moſt Divine and Spiritual Nature. This though it might poſſibly be ſo, yet we are without any ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it was ſo, and ſuch Conjectures of things without our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or thoſe <hi>media</hi> that we are capable to exerciſe for the acqueſt thereof, are uncertain and endleſs: Upon ſuch conjectural Congruities the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> had their <hi>Dii ex Deo,</hi> the <hi>Manichees</hi> their <hi>Aeones,</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> his <hi>Mundus Animarum:</hi> and therefore I leave it as a Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Opinion is of thoſe who though they ſuppoſe the World not to be eternal, and perchance think with reaſon enough that the duration of Eternity <hi>à parte ante</hi> is ſuch as is only competible to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, and not communicable to any Created Being, at leaſt ſuch as is in its own nature either corruptible, alterable, or compounded: yet to the end that they may carry the Communication of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Benignity as far as is poſſible, are not contented to ſuppoſe the World to be ſempiternal or eternal <hi>à parte post,</hi> or to be as ancient as the Sacred Scriptures inform us, but will carry up the Creation of the World to an immenſe antiquity, long before Six Thouſand years, and thereby they think they do at once ſalve the large Accounts which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chineſes</hi> give of the duration of their own Kingdoms and Hiſtories, and alſo do, as they think, ſatisfie at leaſt in a great meaſure that immenſe Benignity of the glorious God, whom they declare not only infinitely Good in himſelf, but neceſſitated by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his nature to comunicate his Goodneſs <hi>ad ultimum poſſe</hi> to things <hi>ad extra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Suppoſition of theirs ſeems to be grounded upon two matters
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64147:52"/>
which are as I think miſtakes, or at leaſt do no way appear to be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true; namely, 1. That Almighty God, though he be by them admitted a free and intellectual Agent, is neceſſitated <hi>ab extrinſeco</hi> from the Perfection of his nature to do good <hi>ad extra, ad ultimum poſſe,</hi> which ſeems untrue. 2. And it ſeems likewiſe untrue, that if he were under that intrinſecal neceſſity, yet he were thereby bound to make the World ſooner than we ſuppoſe he made it: For as to the fabulous protractions of the age of the World by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> or others, they are uncertain idle Traditions, whereof they have no evidence but from the Impoſtures of their fabulous Prieſts.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe, namely, the Intrinſick Neceſſity of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to do good <hi>ad extra, ad ultimum poſſe,</hi> this is that Opinion upon which ſome have built their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Eternity of the World, and others, driven from that <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> by the abſurdities that accompany it, build their imagination though not of the Eternity, yet of a prodigious Antiquity of the World. But it ſeems to me, That although Almighty God being infinitely and eſſentially Good, is neceſſarily carried to will and delight in that his own infinite Goodneſs; yet in his acts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity <hi>ad extra</hi> he is not neceſſitated by his own Perfection to act <hi>ad ultimum poſſe,</hi> but although his own Nature be Benign and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, the ſeaſons, degrees and meaſures, and other circumſtances of its Emanations are guided and directed by the freedom of his own Will.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon thereof is evident, namely, Becauſe all the Good that is without, or that is poſſibly communicable by him to any thing without him, is finite, and cannot be infinite; and therefore he cannot be carried to it by an infinite deſire and intention, and yet ſuch it muſt be, if it be <hi>ad ultimum poſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if it ſhould be ſo, there would be infinite abſurdities follow which cannot be ſolved; as for inſtance, That either this preſent World muſt be actually of an infinite extenſion, or that there muſt be either infinite Worlds, or at leaſt as many Worlds as is poſſible to be by the power of Omnipotence. That he hath made ſome Beings of that perfection, that Omnipotence it ſelf cannot make them one grain perfecter, that they are but in the very next degree of perfection to himſelf, and cannot have the addition of one grain more to the excellence of their nature; that the Univerſe is ſo perfect, <hi>omnibus numeris,</hi> that it is not poſſible for Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence it ſelf to add to it, no nor to alter it in one jot or tittle, either to make it better or worſe, or otherwiſe than it is; nay he cannot, <hi>pro arbitrio</hi> or dominion make one ſpire of Graſs, or one Fly, or one Worm more or leſs than he hath made, becauſe he hath made it as good as is poſſible to make it, and he is under the neceſſary obligation of his own indiſpenſable Perfection to make and keep it juſt as he hath made it: That the whole Ocean of Omnipotence and infinite Goodneſs is already exhauſted in the Work of the Univerſe, and hath nothing of good left that he can do more. Theſe are the conſequences of this Poſition, That the Divine Will is neceſſitated by the Perfection of his Nature to do good <hi>ad ultimum poſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as theſe abſurdities evince the untruth of the Aſſertion, ſo it is apparent in the very Frame of the Univerſe it ſelf and the integrals thereof,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64147:52"/>
that it is untrue: For upon this Suppoſition admitted, there could not be a diſparity in the Natures of things, but every thing ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in that ſtate of being that might be capable of as much of the Divine Beneficence as it were poſſible for God to communicate. And if it be ſaid that this diſparity of things in their degrees of ſpecifical or individual perfection contributes to the beauty and convenience of the Univerſe, which is the primary Object of the Divine Beneficence, this ſalves not the Objection; becauſe it is poſſible that many things might have a greater meaſure of ſpecifical Perfection with great advantage to themſelves and to the Univerſe alſo. But ſuppoſe this inequality of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſpecifical or individual Perfection might nevertheleſs contribute to the advantage of the Univerſe conſidered collectively, yet do we not ſee that daily there are many deficiencies even in individuals, which might have been ſupplied with exceeding benefit to themſelves, and with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Univerſe? Are there not among men ſome that want the integrity of their Limbs, ſome that want their Senſes, Memories, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; ſome that are extremely vicious, and unjuſt, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate even from the common Principles of Humanity, many that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed and infirm, many good men of ſhort and difficult lives; and might not all theſe have the integrity of their Bodies and Minds proportionate to the perfection of their ſpecifical Nature; be virtuous, ſound, long-lived, with advantage to themſelves and mankind, and yet without detriment to the Univerſe? And therefore ſurely ſuch they would have been, if the glorious God were neceſſitated to be Beneficent <hi>ad ultimum poſſe,</hi> unleſs we ſhould preſumptuouſly aſſert an impotence in him to rectifie theſe things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if we ſhould ſuppoſe this to be true concerning the Divine Obligation or Neceſſity, let us now examin what the making of the World a million of years elder than it, is would do in the buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is true, though we ſay the World is not, cannot be eternal <hi>à parte ante,</hi> yet it is certain that either upon the nature of the thing or the part of the Almighty and the abſolute power of God, without relation to the determination of his Will, there can be no determinate moment, or <hi>tempus ſignatum imaginarium,</hi> within the bounds or limits (if I may ſo ſpeak) of antecedent infinite duration, but God might have made it ſooner than he made it; and if a year ſooner than he made it, he might have made it a thouſand years ſooner than that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſequently, if the World be not eternal, it is impoſſible to aſſign any time for its making it which anſwered the <hi>ultimum poſſe</hi> of Almighty God for the making it; and therefore if we ſhould ſuppoſe the World to have been made as many millions of years before it was made, as there have been minutes ſince it was made, it could not anſwer the <hi>ultimum poſſe</hi> of Almighty God, nor anſwer that imaginary Obligation or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his nature to do good <hi>ad ultimum poſſe,</hi> for ſtill it might have been made before any <hi>hora ſignata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſequently the time of the Creation of the World, if it were on this ſide an eternal period, could neither be determined by his want of Power, nor by his neceſſitated Benignity <hi>agere ad ultimum poſſe,</hi> for in that indefinite time within the limits of Eternity no time can be aſſigned before which he could not have made the World, though it be admitted it could not be eternal.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:64147:53"/>4. Conſequently there could be nothing that could determin the time or period wherein the World was to have been made, but the abſolute <hi>Divinum beneplacitum;</hi> there could be nothing without him to determin it, for nothing was till he made it, nor any thing but his own Will within him that could determin it: for his power and goodneſs were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined to do it ſooner or later, ſince no time could be aſſigned for the doing of it but it might be done ſooner.</p>
               <p>And when all is done, his Beneficence, nor the good which the created Beings might receive from that Beneficence, had had no imaginable advance or enlargement, if the World had been created millions of millions of years before it was; and that upon theſe plain evident Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe though the World had indeed been at this hour ancienter, and laſted longer, if it had been created a million of years ſooner, yet the future Eternity or Sempiternity of the World being of all hands ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, though the Eternity <hi>à parte ante</hi> be denied, there will be a future infinity for the emanation of the Divine Goodneſs and Beneficence to his Creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſidering the nature of the Beings themſelves that partake of the Divine Beneficence, there is no advance at all to them by receiving it ſooner or later: If <hi>Plato</hi> had been a million of years before he in truth was, and had lived his proportion of eighty years, he had taſted no more of the Divine Beneficence than if he had lived as he did about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ſince.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither is there any difference in reſpect of the ever-glorious God, for he received no acceſs of happineſs by the Creation of the World, nor ſtood at all in need of it: And if he might be imagined to have received any contentment in it, yet he had an eternal proſpect of all things as if they had been really made eternally: And beſides, if the World had been myriads of millions of years ſooner than it was, yet it was ſtill infinitely ſhort of an eternal duration; Almighty God had been an infinite duration before without that World, which had it been made millions of years before it was, yet had not held any proportion to that infinite duration that preceded.</p>
               <p>And whatſoever hath been formerly ſaid againſt the Eternity of this World doth equally conclude againſt an eternal being of any World ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to this, much more againſt an eternal ſucceſſion of infinite Worlds, either of which can have no certainty, nor have any evidence or probability; ſo that as there cannot be attributed an eternal duration <hi>à parte ante</hi> to any one ſuch ſuppoſed pre-exiſting World, ſo much leſs to a ſucceſſion of Worlds.</p>
               <p>The very ſame Arguments that conclude againſt the poſſibility of eternal Motion, or the eternal ſucceſſions of Generation and Corruption, or of ſucceſſive Individuals of Mankind do as effectually conclude againſt an eternal ſucceſſion of infinite Worlds, and therefore I ſhall ſpare the repetition of them.</p>
               <p>The Arguments which I have before uſed are ſuch, as though at the firſt view they ſeem intricate, yet they have ſtrength of evidence in them, and ſuch as are accommodate to the nature of the thing which requires Arguments of ſuch a nature; and thoſe Arguments that are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64147:53"/>
more experimental and obvious to ſenſe, though they are more eaſie to be apprehended, yet are more eaſie to be evaded by the Aſſertors of the Eternity of the World.</p>
               <p>In the before-mentioned Book <hi>De Aetate Mundi</hi> two experimental Arguments are brought againſt the Eternity of the World, upon which the Author lays ſome weight.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if the World were eternal, by the continual fall and wearing of Waters all the protuberances of the Earth would infinite Ages ſince have been levelled, and the Superficies of the Earth rendred plain, no Mountains, no Vallies, no inequalities would be therein, but the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies thereof would have been as level as the Superficies of the Water.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if this World had been eternal there would have been no Rocks appearing in the Seas above the Water, whereof there are very many viſible; for the motion and agitation of the Water doth wear and eat off gradually the roots and other parts thereof, as is viſible to our obſervation; ſome whereof have their roots ſo corroded by the Water, that they are ready to fall, and others have apparently by that means been either waſted or decayed, that now they are not extant which in ſome mens memory have been ſtanding; and if the bredth of a Barley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn had been conſumed in a million of years, there had been nothing of them left.</p>
               <p>That theſe things are true in fact, and that the reaſon why many of theſe effects are apparent to us to be as they are, is becauſe that theſe Rocks and theſe Protuberances have not been eternal, may bp well attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to that <hi>novitas eſſendi,</hi> that finite period wherein they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, is very probable and evident to him that is ſatisfied otherwiſe, that the World had a beginning, I eaſily grant: But he that aſſerts the Eternity of the World will find out eaſie evaſions of theſe ſenſible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: They will tell us, and with truth enough, that in a great tract even of a finite duration the Earth muſt have and hath had great mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: That by the eruption of Bituminous and Sulphureous Vapours, and the firing thereof, theſe protuberances of Mountains and Hills may be made, and have been made in many parts: That as Warts or Wenns growing in our Hands are thruſt up by the humors miniſtred by the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the orifice of ſome Capillary Vein, and increaſe; ſo in the great Body of the Earth ſuch protuberances may be thruſt out and gradually increaſed, though not ſo eaſily perceptible in one Age, and by this means there may be a continued ſupply of what is ſucceſſively abraded from them by decurſion of Waters: That Matter is never loſt or annihilated: That what is decayed by that decurſion of Waters is in ſome meaſure ſupplied by the terrene <hi>faeces</hi> which that Water brings with it: That by continued viciſſitudes the Earth is repaired by the inſenſible deſcent of Atoms of Matter raiſed in others places, the Atmoſphere being evermore filled with little particles and concretes of Matter which are unceſſantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged upon the Earth, and as unceſſantly again ſupplied in the Air by the more groſs and terreſtrial parts of thoſe Vapours that are raiſed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from the Sea and watriſh places, by means whereof the Water juſtly pays in proceſs of time what is borrowed from the Earth by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual circulation. And that hence it comes to paſs that in proceſs of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64147:54"/>
time, even to our view, Channels that were deep and broad, yet by a little time of dryneſs grow narrow and ſhallow; that thoſe Mountains, whoſe chief ſubſtance is Rock, become cloathed with a ſuperficial Mantle of Earth and Mould; that thoſe places, which were formerly filled with Wood, have buried the fallen Trees three, four, or five foot deep in the ground, by an accretion or cover of Earth, derived to them ſometimes by Alluvions or Floods, ſometimes and moſt ordinarily by the deſcent of thoſe Terreſtrial Particles, that are drawn up together with watry Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and either together with thoſe Waters, or after arefaction thereof in the Air, diſcharged upon the Earth, which doth <hi>reparare deperditum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to thoſe Rocks in the Sea, they will alſo tell us, that the viciſſitudes of the Sea and Land in a long proceſs of time, much more in an eternal duration, are very many and various: Sometimes that becomes Land which was once Sea, as appears in that part of <hi>Egypt</hi> thorough which <hi>Nilus</hi> runs, long ſince obſerved by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and before him by <hi>Herodotus;</hi> and even in our memory great quantities of Land are now firm and habitable, where Ships anciently rode; and on the other ſide many parts are become Sea, which were once firm Land: They inſtance in that traditional vaſt Iſland in the <hi>Atlantick Ocean,</hi> which is drowned, and hath left no Remains of it ſelf, but thoſe Iſlands called the <hi>Canary Iſlands;</hi> but whether that tradition be true or not, it is very probable, that by particular Inundations the Face and State of the Terreſtrial Globe, by great viciſſitudes, is much changed. And therefore though they ſuppoſe the Terreſtrial Globe Eternal, yet the Earth and Water hath not eternally kept the ſame poſition or ſite that now it hath: And therefore the Sea, ſo often (at leaſt in an Eternal Period) ſhifting its Channel, hath not eternally waſhed the ſame Rocks that now it doth, but after an indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and vaſt uncertain Period, it may be of ten or twenty thouſand years, leaves that Channel which before it had, and gives thoſe Rocks that it waſted opportunity to recruit again, and then perchance after a like vaſt Period of Time viſits the ſame Channel again; and therefore though the World might be Eternal, the alluvion of the Sea upon thoſe Rocks might not be eternally continued, but interpolated. And though the Earth be not animated with a Senſible Soul, yet it is poſſible that it may be a great Immortal Vegetable, which may reproduce or increaſe Rocks or Mountains in various viciſſitudes of vaſt Periods of Duration. And this they think very probably to be collected by the obſervation of things, and yet if it be not to be proved to be thus, yet thus poſſibly it may be, which is ſufficient to elude the force of thoſe ſenſible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, theſe Solutions do evade the edge and concludency of thoſe Phyſical Arguments, and therefore much weight is not be laid upon them, but upon thoſe of another nature, whereof in the foregoing part of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>And there is no way to encounter the Solutions that theſe Men do, or may give of theſe two laſt Arguments, but to have recourſe to what hath been before ſaid, namely, that ſince the Solutions are grounded upon a Suppoſition of Eternal ſucceſſive Motions, whereby by viciſſitudes of long uncertain Periods of the Decays and Reparations of the inferior
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64147:54"/>
World, and by eternal viciſſitudes of the tranſlation of the Earth and Seas to ſeveral ſites either by interpolated, or ſucceſſive Motions. And ſince by what hath been before proved, there is an utter impoſſibility in Reaſon and Nature of any Eternity <hi>à parte ante</hi> of continued or interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Motion, there is likewiſe an impoſſibility in Nature that there ſhould be this eternal viciſſitude of decays and repairs of the Earth, or ſhifting of ſtations between the Earth and the Sea. And thus we are at laſt driven to reſort to thoſe though more obſcure yet more concludent Arguments againſt the Eternity of the World which are mentioned in the beginning of this Chapter, or ſuch as are of the like nature, ſome whereof will be hereafter farther conſidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Averroes,</hi> who was a ſtrong Aſſertor of the Eternity of the World, inſiſteth upon a Reaſon which is witty, but upon a miſtake of the nature of eternal duration, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the World were not eternal, but created in ſome certain <hi>Epocha</hi> or Period, it could never have been at all, becauſe an eternal duration muſt neceſſarily have anteceded the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the World; and that Suppoſition excludeth the poſſibility of ſuch its production, and is contradictory to that ſuppoſed <hi>novitas eſſendi</hi> of the World; for, <hi>infinitum non potest pertranſiri,</hi> an infinite duration pre-exiſting to the Worlds production could never be paſſed through, ſo no poſſible acceſſion to the firſt exiſtence of the World through the vaſt compaſs of a pre-exiſting infinite duration.</p>
               <p>But this reaſoning of his is inſufficient, becauſe it takes in but a portion of Eternity which is <hi>à parte ante,</hi> whereas that Maxim is to be applied to the full and entire compaſs of Eternity or Infinitude. For if that Argument ſhould hold, neither <hi>Averroes</hi> nor <hi>Plato,</hi> nor any man elſe could have been born in the World, but muſt have had an eternal exiſtence upon the very ſame reaſon that <hi>Infinitum non potest pertranſiri;</hi> for it is certain that as well an infinite duration anteceded the Birth of <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Averroes,</hi> as it muſt do the production of the World if admitted to have <hi>novitas eſſendi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much touching this preparatory Diſquiſition concerning the Eternity of the World in general.</p>
            </div>

               <head>
                  <hi>CAP. IV.</hi> Concerning the Origination of Mankind; and whether the ſame were Eternal, or had a Beginning.</head>
               <p>IF the World it ſelf were not eternal, this Diſquiſition touching the Eternity of Mankind were needleſs, becauſe decided in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
               <p>Therefore our Inquiry touching the Origination of Mankind, and whether it had or had not a Beginning, is in this place by way of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or Admiſſion, namely, Whether admitting the great Integrals at leaſt of the Univerſe, the Heavens and Heavenly Bodies, the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary World were or at leaſt might be eternal; whether yet Mankind
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64147:55"/>
were, or might be eternal? And the Queſtion poſſibly will be much of the ſame kind, with relation to other at leaſt perfect Animals and Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, yea and all mixed or compound Bodies; for we ſhall eaſily find, that admitting thoſe greater Integrals of the World were eternal, yet whatſoever is ſaid againſt the Eternity of Mankind will bear as hard againſt the Eternity of perfect Animals, and almoſt of all compound Bodies.</p>
               <p>And although for the more orderly diſcuſſion of this Enquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Original of Mankind, I muſt <hi>gratia argumenti,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method propoſed, admit the Eternity of the great Integrals of the World; yet it will appear upon a due examination to be ſuch an Admiſſion as muſt in a great meaſure be contradicted in the debate of what is propounded to be proved, and the particular Reaſons againſt the Eternity of the Humane, Animal, or compounded Bodies will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily infer an impoſſibility, or intollerable abſurdity in the thing admitted. For inſtance:</p>
               <p>To ſuppoſe an eternal exiſtence of the Heavenly Bodies and of the Elementary Bodies in the ſite and poſition in which they are, and to ſuppoſe them in an eternal reſt and unactivity, and without motion, action, paſſion, or perfection of the leſs noble by the more noble, were to ſuppoſe them eternally kept in a uſeleſs, needleſs, imperfect ſtate, for an immenſe, eternal duration, till the firſt moment of their being put into Motion.</p>
               <p>Again, to ſuppoſe the Heavenly Bodies and their Motions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, the Fiery Nature diſperſed through all the Sublunary World, with its activity and motion; and the Paſſive Nature of the more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Elements to have been eternally in the World, and in all that eternal duration not to have produced mixed and compound Bodies in that eternal duration until ſuch a determinate point of it, were a thing ſtrangely repugnant in Nature, unleſs Almighty God were pleaſed to uphold their being, and yet ſuſpend their activity for an immenſe eternal period.</p>
               <p>And yet to ſuppoſe that the compoſition of Bodies out of the Elements (by virtue of the activity and influx of Motion, out of Matter that muſt by that influx be prepared for compoſition) ſhould be as ancient as thoſe Heavens, or that Motion, that Fiery active Principle that muſt compound them out of thoſe ſimpler Bodies out of which they muſt be compounded (as all this muſt be, if they are eternal) is as impoſſible as any thing that can be thought of.</p>
               <p>Again, if we ſhould reſolve the Eternity of the World into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, which being neceſſitated by his goodneſs to do all the good he can, even <hi>ad ultimum poſſe,</hi> and upon that account made the World eternal, it were a ſtrange Suppoſition to imagin that this God ſhould give the great Integrals of the World an eternal being in eternal reſt, without Motion, which is their perfection; or if together with Beings he gave or indeed could give an eternal Motion, it were a ſtrange Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that he ſhould ſuſpend the efficacy of that Motion or Activity of the active Principles upon the paſſive (which both exiſted) for an infinite ſpace, and then after took off that ſuſpenſion: And yet farther, Suppoſe Almighty God did or could give an eternal being to thoſe Active or Paſſive Natures, and an eternal production of all mixed Bodies for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64147:55"/>
an eternal duration but only Mankind (that is the nobleſt of all ſublunary Natures, and apparently the glory of the ſublunary World, and the very end of much of what is produced) I ſay, it is ſtrange that the inferior World ſhould be moved, agitated, and mingled into various mixed Bodies, and thus continue during the immenſity of an eternal duration without Mankind in the World, if Almighty God were neceſſitated by the Benignity of his nature to do the uttermoſt good he could; and if he could produce Man eternally, there was an equal neceſſity for him to do it as to produce a Tree or a Stone eternally.</p>
               <p>All this tends but to this, That if in the debate of this matter we can find that Man either could not be, or was not eternally produced, we have the ſame reaſon to believe that no compound Nature was produced eternally, that no local Motion or corporeal Action was or could be from Eternity; and conſequently, that the Heavenly or Elementary Bodies were not from Eternity: The very ſingle clearing of this one thing, that Man was not eternal, breaks the whole <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Eternity of the World, cuts aſunder all the connexion of evidence that is for it, renders the moſt conſiderable perfection of the World, its Motion, Action, and Operation impoſſible to be eternal, and the exiſtence of the Bulk, Poſition, and Fabrick thereof (unuſeful, imperfect, and deficient without its Motion, Activity, and Operations) improbable to be eternal. So that the Poſition which I endeavour to prove, namely, the Non-eternity of Mankind, doth in truth deſtroy the Suppoſition of the Eternity at leaſt of the inferior World. But this I only ſubjoyn by the way.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Origination of Mankind, <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> in his golden Book <hi>de Die Natali, cap.</hi> 4. gives us the ſhort ſtate of the Queſtion, and the ſeveral Authors that hold either way; <hi>viz. Alii, ſemper homines fuiſſe, nec unquam niſi ex hominibus natos, atque eorum generi caput exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diumque nullum extitiſſe; alii, fuiſſe tempus cum homines non eſſent, &amp; his ortum aliquando principiúmque natura tributum.</hi> Of the former Opinion he reckons <hi>Pythagoras Samius, Ocellus Lucanus, Archytas Tarentinus, Ariſtotle, Theophraſtus, Plato, Xenocrates, Dicaearchus,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>But for the more clear ſtating of the Inquiry, I ſhall reſume ſomewhat which hath been before ſaid touching the Queſtion before-going of the Eternity of the World, and ſome other things I ſhall add thereunto.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is to be obſerved, that the Queſtion is not here, Whether the ſucceſſive Individuals of Mankind may or ſhall be eternal <hi>à parte post,</hi> perpetuated to everlaſting by ſucceſſive generation. For although whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſhall be or no, depends upon the Divine <hi>Beneplacitum,</hi> yet there is no intrinſecal repugnance <hi>ex parte rei,</hi> but that as the World, and the Generations of Men in it have been thus long continued by the communication of the Divine Influence and Providence, ſo both the one and the other by the ſame Influence and Providence may be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without end: And the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch a duration, and ſuch a ſucceſſive multiplication of Individuals imports only a potential infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and ſuch as never ſhall nor can be completed into an actual infinitude of duration or number: So that as Number is potentially infinite by addition of new parts to it, which yet never ſhall nor can ariſe to a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber actually infinite, becauſe after every period thereof there ſtill may be a farther acceſſion of a farther period, yet it never will nor can be actually
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64147:56"/>
infinite, becauſe ſtill there will or may be farther additional periods of duration to that which went before.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion therefore reſts only as to that part of the imaginary Line of the duration of ſucceſſive Individuals that anteceded any given mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or, Whether Mankind had any beginning of being, or were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or without beginning.</p>
               <p>And touching this, there have been ſome that have affirmed Mankind to be without beginning or eternal; others that have affirmed that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had a beginning.</p>
               <p>Touching the latter of theſe, and the various Conjectures touching the manner of it, I ſhall write hereafter; at preſent I ſhall conſider and examin the former.</p>
               <p>Again, of thoſe that have affirmed Mankind to be without beginning, and that maintain not only the Eternity of the reſt of the World, but alſo of Mankind; they are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Such as have affirmed that the ſucceſſive Generations of Men have been eternal, not only without any beginning, but without any firſt Parents of Mankind, and that they have been always <hi>geniti ex genitis.</hi> 2. Thoſe that have ſuppoſed that there were ſome firſt Parents of Mankind, which by a natural and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal generation multiplied their <hi>Species,</hi> but yet that thoſe firſt Parents of Mankind were eternal Individuals, having an eternal exiſtence in their individual nature, and in relation to them the reſt of Mankind were <hi>geniti ex non genitis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the former of theſe Opinions, they ſeem to be divided into theſe enſuing Parties or Opinions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as think the ſucceſſive Generations of Men were eternally ſo, and independent upon any Efficient, and neceſſarily by the eternal eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed courſe of Nature independent upon Almighty God, or any firſt Efficient of the <hi>Species.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as think the ſucceſſive Generations of Men were eternally ſo, but dependently upon Almighty God, yet as a neceſſary Effect produced by Almighty God as a neceſſary or natural Cauſe, as the Light is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent Effect of the Sun.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as think the ſucceſſive Generations of Men were eternally ſo, but dependently upon God as an efficient voluntary Cauſe of them by eternal Creation, yet ſuppoſe that Will intrinſecally determined to ſuch an eternal Creation of Mankind by the indiſpenſable benignity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as though they take Almighty God to be under neither of the former neceſſities, but an Agent purely voluntary, and determining his own Will by it ſelf only, and that deny the eternal ſucceſſions of humane Generations as to the fact; but yet affirm it poſſible that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God might, if he pleaſed, have created the World and Mankind eternally.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſtated the Opinions of the Aſſertors of the Eternity or Beginning of Humane Generations, I ſhall purſue this Method; 1. In this Chapter I ſhall conſider the poſſibility or impoſſibility of eternal Generations of Mankind, with relation to the four preceding Suppoſitions that aſſert it. 2. In the next Chapter I ſhall conſider the poſſibility or impoſſibility of any one Man or Woman eternally exiſting, from whom
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64147:56"/>
Mankind had their production by univocal generation. 3. I ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſider of thoſe evidences of fact and probability, that <hi>de facto</hi> may ſeem to prove that Mankind had their beginning in time, and the Objections againſt it. 4. I ſhall then deſcend to the Conſideration of the various Suppoſitions of thoſe that have ſuppoſed a temporary Origination of Mankind.</p>
               <p>At the preſent therefore I ſhall propound thoſe Reaſons that to me ſeem concludent, that although it might for Arguments ſake be ſuppoſed that ſome parts of univerſal Nature, namely, ſuch as are permanent and fixed, and not <hi>in fluxu,</hi> might be eternal; yet it is ſimply impoſſible that the Generations of Mankind can be eternal in any of the four foregoing ways.</p>
               <p>And before I come to give my Reaſons, I ſhall premiſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In relation to the four foregoing Opinions, there ſeems to be this implyed in them: 1. The two former do moſt clearly take up the entire collection of Mankind and the Generations of them to be a meer natural Effect or Work, with this odds, that the former acknowledgeth no Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient at all; the latter acknowledgeth God the Efficient or firſt Cauſe of the eternal World and the Generations of Mankind as a natural Cauſe: And conſequently they muſt needs hold, that as Man is now generated, ſo he was eternally ſo; and as he is now, ſo he always hath been; and the meaſure that we take of him now will fit to all thoſe innumerable Men that have been within the vaſt compaſs of Eternity: As Man is now a compound Body of the four Elements, ſo he always was; as he is now nine Months <hi>in utero matris,</hi> ſuch was the method and the <hi>mora</hi> of every Man's production; for the Effect is a natural uniform Effect, whether independent upon God as the Efficient thereof, or dependent upon Him as a Natural Effect. And therefore whatſoever is impoſſible to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> or any other individual Man, is incompetible to every Man in all this infinite Collection within the unlimited extent of Eternity.</p>
               <p>But the two latter, though both ſuppoſe an eternity of Generations, and though in Eternity there cannot be ſuppoſed well a firſt, yet do what they can, if they ſuppoſe a production of Man by eternal Creation, they cannot deliver themſelves from theſe conſequences; 1. That there muſt be ſome Man or Men that had his or their beginning in ſome other way then other perſons had it, namely by Creation; for although Creation be an inſtantaneous act of the Divine Will and Power, it muſt of neceſſity be terminated in ſome individual determinate Perſon, and it cannot be <hi>quid vagum;</hi> the conſequence whereof muſt neceſſarily be, That if there were an eternal Creation of any Man or Men, they that were thus created had their production (if we may ſuppoſe ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction) by a different way from the production of thoſe that had their being by generation; and herein this Suppoſition of the Origination of Humane Nature differs from the two former Suppoſitions. 2. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that if the Creation of Man and of the reſt of the World muſt be in the ſame point, as I may call it, of Eternity, the reſt of the World or any part thereof could not be precedent to the Creation of Man; for then they have loſt what they contend for, namely, an eternal Creation of Man: If it were but one imaginable moment after, then the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64147:57"/>
World might indeed have had an eternal exiſtence, but it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Man to have had that eternal exiſtence by Creation, unleſs in the ſame firſt imaginary conceptible moment of Eternity (an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion improper enough I confeſs) Man and the reſt of the World were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created: The conſequence whereof, as I before ſaid, is, that thoſe Men muſt not as the former ſuppoſe all Individuals of Mankind had the ſame natural manner of production, for among the whole Collection ſome one or more had a ſupernatural manner of production, namely, by Creation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This being premiſed concerning the different ſtates of the two former and two latter Opinions, ſomewhat I ſhall ſay in general touching the Reaſons I uſe againſt all theſe Suppoſitions: 1. In general, That that kind of reaſoning which reduceth the oppoſite Concluſion to ſomething that is apparently impoſſible or abſurd, is as much a Demonſtration in diſaffirmance of any thing that is affirmed as can poſſibly be in any caſe, if the Concluſion of the affirming party doth neceſſarily inferr an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or abſurdity in the nature of the thing affirmed, it is a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, <hi>Argumentum cum contradictione concluſionis;</hi> and ſuch will thoſe be which I ſhall bring. 2. Becauſe the former Suppoſitions touching the Eternity of Mankind, though they conclude in the ſame Aſſertion, yet becauſe they do it by ſeveral Suppoſitions, the Arguments that I ſhall uſe ſhall be of three natures; 1. Such as oppoſe in ſpecial the two firſt Aſſertions: 2. Such as eſpecially oppoſe the two laſt: 3. Such as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon oppoſe both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Argument that I uſe againſt the two firſt Suppoſitions is this, That it is evident to Experience and the Conceſſions of thoſe very men, that the Body of a Man and all other compounded Bodies conſiſt not only of Matter antecedent to their Compoſition, but alſo of ſuch a Matter as is digeſted from thoſe more ſimple Bodies which we call the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth: And therefore of neceſſity, and according to the Principles of theſe very men, before the exiſtence of any compounded Body there muſt be of neceſſity, 1. A pre-exiſtence of thoſe ſimple Bodies out of which this compounded or mixed Body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: 2. A pre-exiſtence of thoſe more active Principles in Nature that are neceſſarily pre-requiſite to the mixing of theſe particles of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Bodies, and to the diſpoſition of them to the Union and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of that mixed Body whereinto it is to be formed, namely, the Motions and Influx of the Heavens, the Activity of the fiery Nature, ſubduing the more paſſive parts of Matter to the ſuſception of that Form wherein it is to be brought. 3. A <hi>mora,</hi> or due ſpace of time intervening between the firſt coagulation of Matter and the firſt inſtant of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thereof, and the complement thereof in its determinate <hi>Species,</hi> which according to the degree of its ſpecifical perfection is ſometimes longer, and ſometimes ſhorter; as the Statuary ſtrikes more ſtrokes upon that piece of Marble that is completed into the Statue of <hi>Caeſar</hi> than into the Cube or Pedeſtal whereon he ſtands: all theſe muſt precede, not only in nature, but in time, before the complement of any compounded Body in its ſpecifical conſtitution. And therefore ſince all mixed Bodies require neceſſarily the antecedence of theſe ſimple Bodies, this action of the more active Principles, this <hi>mora</hi> in the full diſpoſition and digeſtion
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64147:57"/>
of them into their complement of a mixed Being, it is ſimply neceſſary that there muſt be a poſteriority in time of every compounded Body, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Body of Man, to theſe more ſimple Bodies out of which it is conſtituted, and thoſe ſucceſſive and gradual actions, and of the more active Nature by which it is diſpoſed and completed in its being: And if once we admit a priority and poſteriority, it is impoſſible the latter can be eternal, becauſe it hath neceſſarily ſomething that actually preceded it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Argument againſt the Eternity of Mankind upon the two latter Suppoſitions is thus; If Man were eternally created, or con-created with the reſt of the World, it is of abſolute neceſſity that that Creation muſt be terminated in that individual Perſon that was thus created. For whether Creation be eternal or not eternal, it muſt neceſſarily be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in ſome individual Being that is ſo created. And it is neceſſary alſo that that created Perſon were created in ſome determinate ſtate, and in a ſtate anſwerable to the nature of theſe Men that we now ſee; and though his Life were longer than ours, yet it would be certain that he lived as we do, one day, one month, one year after another, and that thoſe firſt created Perſons did generate their kind by the conjunction of Sexes, as is done in the World. And therefore if both Sexes were created, yet ſooner or later they propagated their kind, as is now done; for though they themſelves had a differing manner of production from thoſe that ſucceeded them, we muſt conceive that their Conſtitution was the ſame, otherwiſe we ſhall not ſo much ſuppoſe an eternal Creation of Man, as of ſomething elſe of a nature eſſentially differing from Man; which is contrary to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it ſelf: And if this be ſuppoſed, we ſhall never deliver our ſelves from intollerable difficulties and abſurdities. For, 1. There would of a neceſſity be a firſt Man, which cannot be conſiſtent with the attribution of Eternity to Mankind. Again, 2. That firſt Man, if created eternally, muſt needs be diſtant from us by a leſs portion of duration after he had lived a year or two; and conſequently the duration from his age of two years could not be eternal, for it is ſhort of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of his Creation by two years, and therefore not eternal; neither could his Creation be eternal, for then the adding of two years to a duration leſs than infinite ſhould make it infinite, which is abſurd and impoſſible. Again, 3. Was the generation of the firſt born Man at an infinite diſtance from us, and eternal, or no? If it were, then it muſt be of the ſame antiquity with the Creation of the firſt Man; and ſo the firſt born Man was eternal, and was conſequently before he was born; and his Eternity ſhould be ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years ſhort of the Eternity of his Father, yet both eternal: If the Birth of that Man were not eternal, then conſequently the Generations of Mankind are neither infinite nor eternal; nay conſequently the Creation of the firſt Man could not be eternal nor an infinite diſtance from us, for there muſt neceſſarily be a determinate Period between the Creation of the firſt Man and the Birth of the ſecond, and that time muſt neceſſarily be finite; and the addition of a finite duration to a finite duration can never make an infinite duration.</p>
               <p>Eternity therefore, and a duration actually infinite, cannot be applied to ſucceſſive Beings: The abſurdities and incongruities that ariſe upon ſuch an application are infinite and uncurable, and not to be attempted:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64147:58"/>
Nothing but an infinite and indiviſible Being is able to ſuſtain an infinite and eternal duration, it will never fit other things, it is too great for them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I now come to conſider thoſe Reaſons that are applicable indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to all the former four Suppoſitions, and render them all alike vain, abſurd, and impoſſible. I ſhall reſume ſome of thoſe that I uſed before againſt the Suppoſition of the World's Eternity, and I ſhall ſubjoyn ſome others more particularly applicable to the condition of Man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the ſucceſſive Generations of Mankind were eternal, then of neceſſity ſome one Man among them that preceded us was infinitely diſtant from us that are now living in point of duration, and infinite numbers of Men have intervened between us and him; this is plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable.</p>
               <p>If ſo then, if this Man lived to the ordinary age of man, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, till thirty years old, and then had a Son, and after this he lived to ſeventy years old, and died: Was this Son of his diſtant from us an infinite duration, an infinite period of years; or were there infinite Perſons that intervened between this Son and us his remote deſcendants or no? If there were, then the duration from his Father, which was thirty years before his Son, muſt be thirty years greater than the duration of the Son, and yet the Son as eternally exiſting as his Father: if not, then thirty years added to the finite duration from the Son to us muſt make it infinite. There were infinite Perſons in the interval between us and his Father, and but finite between us and his Son, and yet the odds between both muſt be but one. The Father's Death muſt be eternally diſtant from us as well as his Birth, and yet his birth ſeventy years before his death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall here alſo reſume the Argument above-given againſt the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Motion (which yet is no other but a different kind of application of the Argument laſt mentioned.) Whatſoever is now paſt and gone, was moſt certainly once preſent; therefore the moſt remotely diſtant Man in that vaſt Period of Eternity was certainly once actually exiſting, and though he be now paſt, yet thoſe Attributes and Conceptions that were applicable and affirmable of him when preſent, are now affirmable and applicable to him though paſt, (abating only the relations of paſt and preſent,) if when he was preſent and actually exiſting he could not be eternal, ſo neither can the addition of all the ſucceeding myriads of Men by ſucceſſive procreation make any one day of that Man's age to be infinitely diſtant from us, for it could not be ſo when he was preſent and exiſting. That Man whereof we ſpeak was ſuch a Man as we are, lived ſucceſſively as we do, and though poſſibly he might be longer-lived than us, yet his age was meaſured by days and years as ours is, and could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be without beginning; and conſequently this Man, when exiſting, was the <hi>Radix</hi> of all that ſucceeded him, the <hi>terminus claudens</hi> of all his ſucceeding Generations, which bounds and terminates <hi>à parte ante</hi> all the ſucceeding Generations; as that Man when preſent was not eternal, ſo neither can the addition of ſucceſſive Generations produce a Line of duration of infinite extent, for that duration is <hi>utrinque clauſa,</hi> namely, with that Man which was once preſent, and that Moment wherein I now write.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:64147:58"/>3. My third Argument (which though it be common, is very evident) is this:</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible, <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> that any multitude can be actually infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, or, (which is all one) ſo great that there cannot be a greater, or, <hi>multitudo omnium maxima:</hi> But if we ſhould ſuppoſe an eternal ſucceſſion of Generations of Men, or an infinite <hi>Series</hi> of ſucceſſive individual Men, there would neceſſarily follow an infinite multitude, or a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude than which there could not be a greater. And therefore <hi>ex im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibili,</hi> there could not be ſuch an eternal ſucceſſion of Generations.</p>
               <p>The firſt Propoſition, namely, That it is impoſſible there ſhould be an infinite multitude, or (which is all one) a number actually infinite, is evident by thoſe many contradictions, abſurdities, and intollerable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities that would follow upon ſuch a Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>It muſt needs be granted that an infinite multitude is the greateſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that can be, there can be no greater; if there can be a greater, then the former was not infinite. For when we have to do with any thing whoſe very eſſence, as I may call it, conſiſts in being greateſt, there <hi>majus</hi> and <hi>minus</hi> do alter the very eſſence of the thing, and is identical with <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus:</hi> A greater or larger Line, or Superficies, or Body is not <hi>magis linea, ſuperficies, aut corpus,</hi> than a ſhorter, narrower, or leſſer Line, Superficies, or Body, becauſe they agree in the ſame common nature, the one as well as the other is a Line, Superficies, or Body. And ſo of other things.</p>
               <p>But when the very Eſſence of the thing conſiſts in a certain eſſential difference of <hi>major</hi> or <hi>minor,</hi> there <hi>major</hi> or <hi>minor</hi> vary the kind.</p>
               <p>And therefore a Line of two foot long (with relation to that extent) eſſentially differs from a Line of a foot long, which under that notion is eſſentially greater or more extended than a Line of a foot long, and it is impoſſible that a Line of a foot long ſhould be as long as a Line of two foot long, as it is impoſſible that a part ſhould be equal to the whole. And yet upon the ſuppoſition of an infinite multitude, it muſt neceſſarily follow that one infinite multitude muſt be greater than another, and yet both infinite; upon the ſuppoſition of infinite Generations of Men, there muſt have been an infinite multitude of antecedent Individuals and Generations of Men a million of years ſince, and yet neceſſarily by the addition of thoſe Individuals that have accrued ſince in that great Period of a Million of years, there muſt needs be an acceſſion of a vaſt number to that multitude that was before, whereby it muſt neceſſarily be greater, and yet both ſuppoſed infinite, that is, ſuch than which there can be nothing greater. Again, the multitude of the individual Men muſt be infinite, and yet the multitude of theſe Mens Eyes muſt be double to the number of Men, and yet both be infinite. And it is but a vain thing to ſay, that though the collection of Men be antecedently infinite, yet it is <hi>clauſa</hi> and <hi>finita</hi> in the preſent extreme: as if a Line ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended infinitely from the point <hi>A,</hi> the Line would be finite at the point <hi>A,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">— A</note> though infinite towards the other part; and the appoſition of the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional number of Men is to that part that is finite: For though the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of Men are limited towards the extreme that is next us, or at the Period of a Thouſand years before us: and though the appoſition of the acceſſional number be towards this hithermoſt extreme which is <hi>clauſa</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:64147:59"/>
or <hi>finita,</hi> yet the appoſition is to the whole number or multitude, and the collection thereof, and therefore the abſurdity of the Suppoſition of an infinite pre-exiſting multitude, which is more enlarged by the increaſe, is equally evident, as if we could ſuppoſe an appoſition of the number to any other part; for the ſcope of the Argument is to prove the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of Infinite and Multitude, becauſe no Multitude can be greater than Infinite, yet ſuch would it neceſſarily be, if we ſhould ſuppoſe the multitude now greater than it was a thouſand years before: And to render it yet more plain, ſuppoſe on the other ſide we ſhould take the other Operation of Arithmetick, namely, Subduction: If out of that ſuppoſed infinite multitude of antecedent Generation, we ſhould by the Operation of the Underſtanding ſubduce Ten, whether we ſubduct that Number of Ten out of the laſt Generations of Men, or out of Generations a thouſand years ſince, or indeterminately out of the whole Collection, certainly the reſidue muſt needs be leſs by Ten than it was before that Subduction made, and yet ſtill the Quotient muſt be as great as before, which is ſtill infinite.</p>
               <p>Again, the incongruity of the Suppoſition of an infinite multitude appears in this, that the part muſt be as infinite as the whole: It is the Inſtance of <hi>Algarel,</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Averroes;</hi> the Number of 4 multiplied into it ſelf produceth the Square Number of 16, and that again multiplied by 4 produceth the Cubick Number of 64. If we ſhould ſuppoſe a multitude actually infinite, there muſt be infinite Roots, and Square and Cubick Numbers, yet of neceſſity the Root is but the fourth part of the Square, and the ſixteenth part of the Cubick Number. The Inſtance of <hi>Algarel,</hi> in his firſt Diſputation with <hi>Averroes,</hi> which <hi>Averroes</hi> endeavours to anſwer (but tyres himſelf in vain to do it) may explain this Conſequence: The <hi>Sun</hi> paſſeth through the Zodiack in one year, <hi>Saturn</hi> paſſeth through it in thirty years; ſo that the Revolution of <hi>Saturn</hi> to the Revolution of the <hi>Sun</hi> is as one to thirty, and conſequently as one Revolution of <hi>Saturn</hi> contains thirty Revolutions of the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſo two Revolutions thereof muſt contain ſixty Revolutions of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and ſo if we ſhould ſuppoſe their Revolutions infinite, yet the proportion of the Revolutions muſt neceſſarily hold the ſame, namely, in all the whole Collection, the Number of the <hi>Suns</hi> Revolutions muſt be thirty times as many as the Number of <hi>Saturns</hi> Revolutions, and conſequently the Revolutions of <hi>Saturn</hi> can be no more than one thirtieth part of the Revolutions of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and yet both being ſuppoſed infinite, the part, namely, the thirtieth part, muſt be as great as that whereof it is the thirtieth part, which is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>And this impoſſibility holds in all other things that have ſucceſſion or extenſion, as in quantity, motion, ſucceſſive duration of things, in their nature ſucceſſive. But it is more plain and conſpicuous in diſcrete quantity, or different Individuals, which are already meaſured by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, without any breaking the continuity that is in things that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity, as continued quantity and motion. And therefore they that go about to demonſtrate the impoſſibility of Eternal Motion, <hi>à parte ante,</hi> or infinite extenſion in a Body, Line, or Superficies, do firſt break it into parts to meaſure them, and reduce them to diſcrete quantity, becauſe the demonſtration is more clear and ſenſible thereby, and therefore they break
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64147:59"/>
the Meaſures of Motion into Hours, Days, Years, or ſuch like Meaſures, or into Periodical Revolutions, and ſo they break continued Quantity into Palms, Feet, Perches, or the like; becauſe though the repugnancy of Infinitude be equally incompetible to continued or ſucceſſive Motion, Duration, or continued Quantity, and depends upon the incompoſſibility of the very nature of things ſucceſſive or extenſive with Infinitude, yet that incompoſſibility is more conſpicuous in diſcrete Quantity or Multitude, that ariſeth from parts or Individuals already actually diſtinguiſhed: But the reaſon of both is the ſame, eſpecially if broken and divided into real or imaginary parts.</p>
               <p>But in the Matter in queſtion, namely, Multitude of ſucceſſive Men, or ſucceſſive Generations of Men, there is already a ſeparate, divided, diſcrete multitude, without any antecedent work of my Underſtanding, or otherwiſe, to reduce it into parts or diſcrete multitude; and ſo the Inſtances of the Abſurdities that ariſe by an infinite multitude of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals and diſtinct Generations, is made more plain and open to view: And he that is deſirous to proſecute theſe <hi>Aſyſtata</hi> of Infinitude and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, let him reſort to the Prelections of <hi>Faber,</hi> collected by <hi>Monſuerius,</hi> in his <hi>Metaphyſica demonſtrativa de infinito.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to ſay the truth, there are none of the Ancients that have any weight in them, that do not agree, that it is impoſſible that any Quantity, either diſcrete or continued, ſhould be actually infinite, but only poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, either by addition of ſuppoſed parts to either, or by diviſion of Quantity continued into parts infinitely diviſible: But the greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty reſts in the Aſſumption, which is next to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Propoſition is this, That if Eternal Generations of Men were admitted, there would be this abſurd Conſequence, that a multitude given might be actually infinite, which remains to be proved.</p>
               <p>The Objection that ſtands in the way ſeems to be this, That there is no repugnancy that Multitude might be poſſibly infinite, for as we may without any inconvenience ſuppoſe, that the Generations of Mankind might be ſempiternal or eternal, <hi>à parte poſt,</hi> ſo there is no inconvenience to ſuppoſe them eternal, <hi>à parte ante,</hi> for they never co-exiſt, but are ſucceſſive, and ſo do not conſtitute any multitude co-exiſting actually infinite, which is indeed impoſſible; but there is no implication or repugnancy that there might be an infinite ſucceſſion of Generations, for they are not together, but one Generation paſſeth and another ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth.</p>
               <p>And hence it is they ſay, that <hi>in moventibus vel cauſis per ſe ſubordinatis,</hi> there cannot be <hi>proceſſus in infinitum,</hi> but we muſt neceſſarily fix in a Firſt Mover, between whom and the laſt Motion or Effect there cannot be a <hi>ſeries</hi> of Infinite Cauſes for two Reaſons: Firſt, Becauſe if there were Infinite Movers or Cauſes, moving <hi>per ſe</hi> to the ſame effect or motion, the motion would be infinite, and ſo would the time wherein that motion would be abſolved, for <hi>infinitus motus non fit in finito tempore.</hi> Secondly, And again, there would be an actual Infinitude of co-exiſting Cauſes, which is impoſſible; and therefore for the purpoſe, to the production of this generation of an Inſect by putrefaction, there is not an infinite <hi>ſeries</hi> of Cauſes <hi>per ſe</hi> co-operating to its production, but the <hi>ſeries</hi> of Cauſes is finite; for the active qualities of the Elements move the Matter, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64147:60"/>
the Heat and Influence of the Heavens agitate and move, it may be, the Elementary Body, and the Intelligences move the Heavenly Bodies, and Almighty God the <hi>Primum Movens</hi> moves the Intelligences, and theſe are finite in number: But in <hi>cauſis aut moventibus accidentaliter ſubordinatis</hi> there may be an Infinitude or Eternity, thus the Father may beget the Son, and the Grandfather begat the Father, and ſo backward to Eternity, and ſo in the ſucceſſive productions of all Animals <hi>ex ſemine.</hi> For though the Individuals ſucceſſively exiſting from all Eternity, muſt needs be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, yet they do not coexiſt, but as one Generation comes another decays, and ſo make no infinite multitude; and conſequently, that all the abſurdities that are heaped upon the Suppoſition of infinite multitude or numbers, conclude nothing to the matter in queſtion, becauſe there is no infinite multitude, becauſe no infinite Individuals or Generations of Mankind coexiſting: And though this cannot at all, according to their ſuppoſition, any way admit the poſſibility of an infinitely extended Body, Line, Superficies, or Place, becauſe that would be an actual infinitude in extent; yet as to ſucceſſive continued things, as ſucceſſive Motion, as that of the Heavens, and ſucceſſive Duration, as that of Motion which we call Time, there is nothing of inconvenience according to their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, if they be infinite, eternal, and without beginning; becauſe though they conſiſt of infinite Parts, yet they are not altogether, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſting, without which there is no real Multitude.</p>
               <p>So that the Queſtion will be hereby reduced to this Point, Whether in this ſucceſſion of Generations and Individuals of Mankind there be ſuch a Multitude produced that is conſiſtent with Infinitude therein.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here lay hold of that Suppoſition of the Immortality of the Souls of the ſeveral Individuals of Mankind (which if ſuppoſed, would make an infinite multitude actually coexiſting of ſeparate Souls) becauſe ſome of thoſe that maintain the Eternity of Mankind, deny the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul; others deny the Immortality of the Soul in its indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduation, ſuppoſing it to reſolve into a certain common Element of Souls; and others, as the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> though allowing the Immortality of Souls in their individuation, yet ſuppoſe a finite number of Souls might ſupply the infinite Succeſſions of Men by Tranſmigration of theſe in their due time: This I lay aſide, becauſe it would neceſſarily occaſion other Diſputes with Men of thoſe Perſwaſions.</p>
               <p>I do therefore ſay, That upon the Suppoſition of the Eternal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Generations of Men, and the infinite ſucceſſive Individuals thereby ariſen, there doth ariſe ſuch a Multitude as is equally inconſiſtent with Infinitude, as if the Individuals had been all coexiſting, and that all thoſe foregoing <hi>Aſyſtata</hi> that render any number or multitude of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſting Individuals impoſſible to be infinite, render the multitude of ſucceſſive Individuals impoſſible to be infinite; abating only the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence of infinite coexiſting Men to an infinite <hi>moles,</hi> which inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience indeed falls not upon the ſucceſſions of Individuals, ſome by death and corruption making room for new Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>And to make good what I ſay, I ſhall deliver theſe enſuing Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as in things that are preſent, while they actually are, they alſo neceſſarily are; ſo in things that have been, they have been while they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64147:60"/>
were, actually and neceſſarily: It is as certain that my Father and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father once actually were <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> as it is certain that I now actually am; for though in things that are yet to come, they are only in poſſibility, and not in act; yet in things that have already been, they have been as actually as what now is; <hi>in praeteritis non datur poſſibilitas;</hi> and it is as certain that what is paſt, once was actually preſent and exiſting, as what now is, is actually preſent and exiſting. This I ſay to prevent that Objection, That things paſt and things to come are of the ſame nature in relation to their exiſtence, and that only our manner of apprehenſion is that which makes things future only <hi>inter poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That things that once exiſted and are now paſt, do as really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a multitude (if many) as things that are coexiſting; It is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Grandfather and Father and Son did as really make up a multitude, that is, one man, and one man, and one man, (which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude we call artificially three, though the Father and Son were both <hi>Poſthumi</hi>) as if they all had or did all now exiſt together; and it is as true a Predication to ſay that theſe were many, as it were in caſe they had all coexiſted, or were now coexiſting: And thoſe three Revolutions of the Firſt Moveable that were paſt three days ſince, are as really a multitude of Revolutions, as the three Stars that this hour coexiſt in Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation are a multitude of Stars; and when I ſpeak of a multitude, I mean more than one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That although number, or the digeſting things under this or that number, whether Collective, as three, ſix, nine; or Ordinal, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third, or fourth, be but an operation of the Underſtanding only, yet antecedent to any act of the Underſtanding, and without the help of it, <hi>unum</hi> and <hi>multa,</hi> and of thoſe <hi>multa, plura,</hi> or <hi>pauciora</hi> have a reality: <hi>Plato</hi> is one, and <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> are <hi>multi,</hi> or more than one; and <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> are a greater multitude than <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> antecedently to any operation of the Underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That antecedently to any act of the Underſtanding, even in thoſe things that have a ſucceſſive exiſtence, and are not all together, there is as real an unity or multiplicity as in things coexiſting. For inſtance, The Revolution of Heaven that was diſpatched the firſt Natural day of the laſt week, was as really, as that Revolution which now is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding really is; and as it really was, ſo it really was but one: And the Revolutions that followed in the two next Natural days were really more than one, and therefore <hi>multa;</hi> and the Revolutions of the three next days after, was a multitude greater than the Revolutions of the two former days; and all thoſe ſix Revolutions were really a greater multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Revolutions than any one of the former multitudes, and this without and before any operation of the Underſtanding, though indeed the Underſtanding gives them their numeral diſtinction of one, and two, and three, and ſix.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the incompoſſibility of Infinitude with Multitude, or the impoſſibility that any Multitude ſhould be infinite, doth not ariſe either upon the exiſtence or non-exiſtence of the Subjects of that Multitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at this or any other determinate time, but from the very nature of Multitude it ſelf: So that whether the <hi>multa</hi> were preſent, or paſt,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64147:61"/>
or fixed, or ſucceſſive, yet the very ſuppoſition of Multitude doth exclude the poſſibility of its infinitude: For 1. It ſuppoſeth a diſcrete Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and any Quantity muſt needs be limited. 2. It ſuppoſeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of many Unities into which it muſt neceſſarily be reſolved, as the conſtituent Subject or Matter of them. 3. It ſuppoſeth a Term which cannot be the greateſt: It is impoſſible that any Multitude can be ſo great but that a greater may be given: So that as although there were no Man in the World to take notice of it, every Triangle would contain three angles equal to two right-angles, though no Man were in the World to diſcover or aſſent to it; ſo though there were no things in the World exiſting to be denominated <hi>multa,</hi> and no Underſtanding in the World to form the conception of it, it would be an eternal Truth, That what conſiſteth of many Unities, as all Multitude neceſſarily doth, cannot be Infinite, nor conſequently any Multitude ariſing by ſucceſſion cannot in the nature of the thing be Eternal.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter therefore, I conclude that it is impoſſible that the Generations of Men or their ſucceſſive Individuals can be Eternal; that a Multitude doth as well ariſe by ſucceſſive as by coexiſting Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals; that if the Generations of Men and their ſucceſſive Individuals were Eternal, there would neceſſarily follow, that the multitude of ſuch Individuals were infinite as well as if they were all coexiſting, and that it is equally repugnant to the nature of multitude, whether of ſucceſſive or of coexiſting Individuals to be infinite: Therefore there could not be ſuch an eternal ſucceſſion of Individuals or Generations.</p>
               <p>And that this Suppoſition, That multitude of coexiſting Individuals, or of Cauſes or <hi>moventes per ſe,</hi> cannot be infinite; but that ſucceſſive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals or Cauſes and Effects <hi>per accidens</hi> might be infinite and eternal, is in truth a Suppoſition not fitted to the truth of things, or grounded upon any rational difference between the things, but a Suppoſition fitted merely to ſerve that other precarious Suppoſition which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his followers had taken up touching the Eternity of the World.</p>
               <p>And theſe ſhall be all the Reaſons that I ſhall trouble my ſelf withall againſt the Eternity of Mankind, or the ſucceſſive Generations and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals thereof; having willingly declined thoſe many other Ingenious Reaſons given by others (as of the Impertranſibility of Eternity, and the impoſſibility therein to attain to the preſent term or limit of antecedent Generations or Ages; the neceſſity of every <hi>poſterius</hi> to have a <hi>prius,</hi> that there be an equal number of <hi>priora</hi> and <hi>poſteriora</hi>) which either are ſo many various Explications of the Reaſons going before, or at leaſt are not ſo evidently concludent, or are ſubject to Exceptions in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>The Objections both againſt the Reaſons before given, and againſt the Suppoſition it ſelf, I ſhall take up after the next Chapter, wherein I ſhall examin the other Suppoſition before mentioned, namely, The eternal exiſtence of ſome firſt Man and Woman, and the ſucceſſive Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from them, wherein, becauſe it is touched before, I ſhall be brief.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. V.</hi> Concerning the Suppoſition of the firſt Eternal Exiſtence of the common Parents of Mankind, and the production of the ſucceeding Individuals from them.</head>
               <p>I Come to that other Suppoſition, namely, of the Exiſtence of ſome one Man and Woman the common Parents of Mankind eternally, and the ſucceſſive multiplication of the Race of Mankind from them by the ordinary courſe of generation. And although this Suppoſition carries with it the clear evidence of its abſurdity, and therefore may ſeem to be ſcarce worth the pains of a Confutation; yet becauſe it lyes in my way, and the Obſervations upon it may be uſeful for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, I ſhall ſay ſomewhat concerning it.</p>
               <p>This firſt eternal Pair we cannot conceive to have an exiſtence by a bare courſe of Nature, without an eternal Creation of them by Almighty God, and an unintermitted Influence from him to ſupport them in a ſtate of Incorruptibility through the vaſt abyſs of Eternity: For he that will ſuppoſe things purely under that courſe of exiſtence that is proper to them by the courſe of Nature, muſt needs ſuppoſe the Individuals of the humane Nature to have been always ſuch, and of ſuch a Frame as now they are, that is, mortal and corruptible Beings; and though their Ages might anciently be of a longer continuance than now they are, yet (upon a bare natural account) they could not be conceived immortal, incorruptible, immutable, no more than they are now.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſince the great admirers of Nature do therefore frame their <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of an eternal Succeſſion of Men, becauſe they think themſelves bound to think that all things have ever been as now they are, and becauſe they will not ſubſtitute other <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the Origination or Exiſtence of things in any other manner than they now ſee them. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as to theſe, and <hi>ad hominem,</hi> it is an Evidence beyond contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that there never was any ſuch pair of Man and Woman that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally exiſted, but that all Men and other perfect Animals, if they were eternal in their <hi>Species,</hi> were eternally produced <hi>ex prius genitis</hi> as now they are, and that there was no one firſt individual of Man or Beaſt that had an eternal Exiſtence, becauſe ſuch a Suppoſition equally croſſeth that courſe of the nature of things which now they ſee, which therefore they make the ſtandard, and their meaſure of things that are paſt.</p>
               <p>They therefore that muſt ſupport an exiſtence of the firſt individual Parents of humane Nature, and that thoſe Individuals had an eternal exiſtence, muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe that they had that exiſtence by an eternal Creation of Almighty God, and an eternal Influx and Support from him in that incorruptible eſtate through all the vaſt extent of an eternal duration.</p>
               <p>And by this means they do think, and that truly, that they aſſert a dependence of the <hi>Species</hi> of things upon Almighty God, which cannot poſſibly be ſuppoſed to be dependent upon him, unleſs they had in their
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64147:62"/>
individual nature their exiſtence from him; ſince it is impoſſible there can be any Suppoſition of the exiſtence of any <hi>Species</hi> (as for inſtance, the <hi>Species</hi> of Man) unleſs it be ſuppoſed to exiſt in Individuals; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a dependence of the <hi>Species</hi> of Mankind upon God as its Cauſe, unleſs there were a dependence of the firſt Individuals thereof upon him <hi>in fieri</hi> as their Cauſe: And they likewiſe hope (but vainly) hereby to avoid the inconveniences of ſucceſſive eternal Generations without any firſt <hi>Caput</hi> or <hi>Radix</hi> of thoſe Generations, though they fall hereby into the ſame difficulties, and others that are equally intricate and inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</p>
               <p>And although in this Suppoſition we muſt admit the firſt pair that were the Roots of Mankind did herein differ from the ſtate of Mankind now, that whereas now Men live ordinarily ſeventy or eighty years, and are ſubject to Death, yet thoſe firſt <hi>radices humani generis</hi> were by the Influence of the Divine Power immortal, and not confined to the age incident now to Mankind, but were able to endure the immenſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an eternal being; yet we muſt alſo ſuppoſe that in other reſpects they were of the ſame Make with theſe individuals of Mankind that are now: For otherwiſe inſtead of a ſuppoſition of an eternal being of the firſt individual Man and Woman that had their being by eternal Creation, we ſhall fall into a ſuppoſition of ſomething that was not in truth Man. And therefore, as according to the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Truth, <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt created Man, though conſiſting of a compoſition intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally diſſolvable, had he continued in Innocence, ſhould or might have held by the continued Influx of the Divine Will and Power a ſtate of immortality and indiſſolubleneſs of his Compoſition; yet as to the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of his nature, and the Integrals thereof, he ſhould have been and continued like other Men.</p>
               <p>And therefore thoſe firſt imaginary eternal Individuals, the Root of Mankind, ſhould have conſiſted of Fleſh and Blood and Mind and Soul and Body as other Men do, they muſt have the ſupport of their Lives by receiving of nouriſhment, by digeſting thereof according to the various proceſs of Digeſtion as we do, they muſt draw in their Breath or Air and emit it again as we do, they muſt have had the like ſucceſſive motion of the Heart and the like circulation of their Blood as we have, the like local motion of their Bodies, the like variation and ſucceſſion of Thoughts as we have; and though the ſuppoſed Eternity of them ſhould have excluded from them corruption or diſſolution in that vaſt Period of Eternity, yet even that duration of his muſt be in this reſpect like ours, that it was a ſucceſſive duration, a duration that was meaſured out by the ſuppoſed coexiſtence of the eternal ſucceſſion of days, and months, and years; And ſuch a duration, as though there had been no ſuch collateral or coextended extrinſick meaſure, yet it was intrinſecally ſucceſſive, and not indiviſible, becauſe he was in his nature a corporeal ſucceſſive Being as well as we; and as we in the very Conſtitution of our <hi>Automaton</hi> have certain ſucceſſive gradual marks and ſigns and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, whereby though there were no external ſucceſſive meaſure, by compariſon whereto the ſucceſſion of our duration might appear, as the Motion of the Heavens and Heavenly Bodies, and the like; yet by thoſe connatural ſucceſſive marks and ſigns our beings and durations would
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64147:62"/>
be meaſured, and the ſucceſſions thereof would appear; as the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Reſpiration, the Pulſes, Palpitations of our Hearts, the variety and ſucceſſion of acts of Senſation, the ſucceſſion of our Thoughts and Cogitations; whereby it is apparent we have not only intrinſecal marks and diſtinctions of our ſucceſſive duration, but alſo that our operations are various: I do, I think and ſpeak that to day which I did not yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the number of my Reſpirations or Pulſes were thus many yeſterday, and as many to day, and it may be more, upon the variety happening in my Body by local motion, repletion, or any caſual perturbation. And as all this I find in my ſelf and other men, ſo I muſt needs conclude the very like was in theſe firſt Individuals that are ſuppoſed to be eternal: For though they had <hi>(ex ſuppoſitione)</hi> an immortality and preſervation from putrefaction or corruption by the eternal and continued influx of the Divine Goodneſs and Power, yet they were not in a ſtate of perfect immutability in their actions, operations, or exiſtence: For then we muſt ſuppoſe them not to have been Humane Creatures, but Gods, or at leaſt Angels; which nevertheleſs are not wholly exempt from their degrees of mutability and variation, at leaſt in their intrinſick operations: it being the ſovereign Prerogative of Almighty God only, to be without variableneſs or ſhadow of change.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall not inquire what are become of thoſe eternal pair of firſt Parents, where they are, or if they are dead, how it came to paſs they could weather and ſtand the ſhock of an eternal duration, and yet be at any time ſubject to a diſſolution. It may be ſaid they were tranſlated into Heaven, or poſſibly they may be ſince dead, the Divine Beneficence ſubducting in this or that point of time that Influence which it communicated from the time of their firſt Creation, whereby they were kept in a ſtate of immortality till that moment of the ſubduction thereof wherein they began to undergo the common Laws of Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>But I do ſay that there is the ſame impoſſibility that any corporeal Individual of ſuch a Make and Conſtitution as Man is, ſhould be eternal <hi>in hoc individuo,</hi> as there is in the eternal ſucceſſion of ſeveral Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals: Such a kind of duration cannot be ſuſtained by ſucceſſion of Humane Individuals, much leſs can it be ſuſtained by any ſingle Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual of Humane Nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſame abſurdities and impoſſibilities would follow upon the admiſſion of the Eternity of one ſingle Humane Individual as of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; becauſe that Individual hath neceſſarily a concomitant ſucceſſion of interpolated Motions, namely, the Pulſes of the Heart, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Motions of Reſpiration, and divers others. All which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce multitudes uncapable of Infinitude, as much as the ſeveral indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of Mankind.</p>
               <p>And among all theſe Pulſes and Reſpirations ſome one will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, infinitely, actually diſtant from ſome other Pulſe within the limits of time, whereupon all thoſe former heaps of incongruities and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities before obſerved will be conſequential.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is impoſſible that any Being can be eternal with ſucceſſive eternal Phyſical changes, or variety of ſtates or manner of exiſtency naturally and neceſſarily concomitant unto it. But if we ſhould ſuppoſe any one
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64147:63"/>
one Man eternal, yet he muſt in the very conſtitution of his being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily have Phyſical changes and variety of ſtates and manners of exiſtence accompanying him, or elſe we muſt unman him, and make him another thing: Therefore no individual Man can be eternal. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Propoſition is evident to any that conſider it. For let us ſuppoſe the firſt Man created eternally in a ſtate of Childhood, Youth, or Reſt, it is neceſſary that he continue eternally in that ſtate, and the firſt moment he moves or alters that ſtate, muſt be on this ſide the uttermoſt limits or compaſs of Eternity, namely, within ſuch a compaſs as is finitely diſtant from this hour, for two Cauſes: Becauſe Reſt muſt needs be antecedent to his Motion, his Childhood antecedent to his Youth, and that to his Manhood; and therefore if his Reſt, Childhood, or Youth were eternal, his motion or alteration of his ſtate cannot be eternal, for then this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Propoſition ſhould be true, That Man did eternally reſt and eternally move, or which is all one, eternally move and eternally not move, for Reſt in Bodies is but an abſence or privation of Motion: That he was eternally a Child, eternally a Youth, and eternally a grown Man.</p>
               <p>But let us ſuppoſe that it were poſſible that he might be created eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in a ſtate of Reſt, or yet in ſome determinate point within the extent of Eternity he ſhould begin to move, that interval that anteceded his Motion muſt be either in a finite or infinite diſtance from us: If we ſhould ſuppoſe it infinite, we contradict our ſelves; for we ſhall make the firſt Motion eternal, and conſequently infinitely diſtant from us; and yet to have a beginning, and ſuch a beginning that was infinitely later than the Eternity of Reſt. And if we ſhall ſuppoſe the interval between the firſt imaginary beginning of that Reſt and the beginning of that Motion, finite, (ſuppoſe for the purpoſe, the time of a Month) then we ſhall upon the very ſame account make the beginning of that Motion to be leſs than eternal, becauſe begun a Month after what was eternal; and conſequently alſo we ſhall make the beginning of that Reſt to be not eternal, becauſe that firſt Motion having a beginning after Eternity, could not be eternal; nor conſequently the beginning of that Reſt could not be eternal, for, <hi>ex ſuppoſitione,</hi> it is but a Month ancienter than that Motion, which was not eternal: and a finite duration added to a finite duration cannot make an infinite duration: Therefore if Man, <hi>ex ſuppoſitione,</hi> were created in any ſtate whether of Motion or Reſt, Childhood, Youth, full grown Age, or whatever other ſtate it be, he muſt neceſſarily ſo perſiſt an infinite duration, and if he undergo any alteration from that ſtate, that alteration muſt be in time, or of a puiſne date to Eternity.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Propoſition is this; That Man in his very Conſtitution is ſuch, that there is unceſſantly and naturally concomitant with him Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical changes, and a variety of ſtates and real changes, without which he would be in vain, and indeed he could not be what he muſt be ſuppoſd to be, namely, eſſentially a Man.</p>
               <p>It hath been heretofore ſhewn what great variety of Motions and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations do neceſſarily accompany his very Conſtitution, and let any Man but think with himſelf what a kind of thing Man would be during all that immenſe abyſs of his firſt being, if he be ſuppoſed eternally and unchangeably reſting, unchangeably moving, eternally and unchangeably
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64147:63"/>
a Child, a Youth, a full grown Man, or any other determinate unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtate. As we have before obſerved, though we ſhould admit a poſſibility of an eternal Creation of Man or of any created Being what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, we muſt ſuppoſe him created under ſome of the conditions which are incident to an individual nature; he muſt be created in ſome determinate <hi>ubi,</hi> and in ſome determinate <hi>ſitus</hi> and ſtate; he muſt be created in Reſt or in Motion, a Child, or a Youth, or a full grown Man: This Man, unleſs he put off his nature, muſt in ſome finite or limited time at leaſt after the eternal imaginary moment of his Being move locally, or with the Motions of alteration, augmentation, growth or decay. Theſe and the like Motions are, upon the account of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, neceſſarily incident to him within certain ordinary Periods, and are connatural to his very Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is irrational, and indeed impoſſible that this created Man ſhould eternally be in a ſtate of Reſt without Motion, without Alteration, Augmentation, Diminution; and yet thus he muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be, if he were eternally made: If once we admit a variation from the ſtate of his Creation, that variation muſt be neceſſarily after an eternal and infinite duration, and therefore within the compaſs of Time: If this Man ſhould be conceived to move or alter his condition within a year, nay a million of years after his Creation, his Creation could not be eternal, becauſe his Creation would be antecedent to that firſt alteration but a finite time; and that firſt alteration could not be eternal, but within the compaſs of a finite time; and conſequently his Creation anteceding that firſt alteration by a finite time could not be eternal, or of an infinite diſtance from the time wherein I write: And conſequently this Creation of Man is not, cannot be eternal, becauſe Man in his very Conſtitution hath the neceſſary concomitants of thoſe alterations that are inconſiſtent with an eternal duration, and ſuch as he cannot be without, according to the very intrinſick fabrick of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Conſtitution one Week, much leſs an eternal duration.</p>
               <p>Again, the truth is, the very Suppoſition of eternal Creation of any Being eſſentially diſtinguiſhed from Almighty God is a perfect contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in it ſelf: That which is eternal, is that which is without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; that which is created, hath neceſſarily a beginning, although by Creation.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall not proſecute this any farther, the Suppoſition of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of Mankind eternally created is ſo abſurd that it deſerves not half the words that have been uſed about it: But I have not been ſo prolix in it for the ſake of the Suppoſition it ſelf, but rather becauſe it gives a fair opportunity of clearing of ſome things which could not be ſo aptly done otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>And upon all this that hath been ſaid, although it ſhould be admitted that there were an eternal being of a firſt Man and a firſt Woman, yet it were impoſſible in Nature that the Generations of Men ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; and this appears upon the Reaſons here given, and likewiſe upon the former Conſideration of the impoſſibility of the Eternity of Mixed Bodies. For it is abſolutely neceſſary that there be an interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt exiſtence of the firſt created Parents of Mankind and the production of any deſcendent from them by ordinary courſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64147:64"/>
or generation: For ſuch a production cannot by any poſſibility be as ancient as the producents; though Creation may be inſtantaneous, yet Generation in its firſt inception, complement and perfection, cannot be inſtantaneous. <hi>Ideóque neceſſe eſt ut primus homo per procreationem ſive naturalem generationem productus, per novem menſes integros poſt primam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionem in utero lateat, &amp; demum post ejuſdem in lucem editionem, per omnes gradus infantiae, pueritiae, juventutis, ad complementum maturioris aetatis deveniat: unde etiam neceſſe est ut primus homo per generationem, poſterior ſit primis hominibus per creationem, per ſpatium ad minus novem men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium. Unde ſi daretur primos humani generis parentes extitiſſe per aeternam creationem, impoſſibile est primos homines ex iiſdem prognatos extitiſſe per aeternam generationem; parentum enim exiſtentia praecedere debet exiſtentiam filii, aliter filius per generationem &amp; pater in ſuis poſitivis existentiis erunt aequè antiqui, utrique aeterni: Et ſi detur exiſtentia patris (licet non ſub ea relatione) ante exiſtentiam filii, filii exiſtentiâ principium habeat neceſſe eſt poſterius exiſtentiâ patris, &amp; ſic non aequè antiquum, &amp; conſequenter nec aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, I do conclude, That although the Creation of the common Parents of Mankind might be <hi>de facto</hi> a very long time ſince, nay although there can be no imaginable time nor imaginable point wherein the Creation of the Individuals might not have been by the Divine Power; nor no imaginable point but that the Creation of the World or Mankind might have been ſooner, if the Divine Will had been ſo pleaſed, (for that denotes only a poſſibility of pre-exiſtence ſooner than it was, if the infinite Agent had ſo pleaſed, and not an actual Eternity) yet it is not poſſible in the nature of the thing that Mankind or any other created Being, that hath ſucceſſion either continued or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete neceſſarily accompanying it, ſhould ſuſtain an actual, eternal, and conſequently infinite duration.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. VI.</hi> Certain Objections againſt the Truths formerly delivered, and againſt the Reaſons given in proof thereof, with their Solutions.</head>
               <p>THere are certain conſiderable Objections againſt thoſe things that are delivered in the precedent Chapters, and againſt the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency or evidence of thoſe Reaſons, theſe I have delivered over to this Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The Firſt <hi>Objection</hi> is thus:</label> That Eternity, and Infinite, and the notions thereof are too large for our Underſtanding, and we are loſt when we go about to frame Conceptions of them; and all our Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations touching them are inevident and unconcludent, becauſe our Underſtanding being but a finite power is capable only of finite Objects, and that the <hi>media</hi> whereby we go about to evince any thing muſt needs be finite, or otherwiſe they are not comprehenſible by us, and therefore wholly diſproportionate to frame Concluſions touching an Object that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64147:64"/>
of all hands is agreed to be infinite; our Faculties are proportionate to thoſe Objects that are derived to us by the help and inſtrumentality of Senſe, either immediately, or at leaſt mediately, and therefore are not proportioned to the nature of Eternity and Infinitude. And therefore our Reaſoning touching theſe matters is as if he that were born blind ſhould Philoſophize touching Light or Colours, whereunto he hath not, nor never had a Faculty accommodate.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is true that there is ſomething which I may call Poſitive in the conception of Eternal or Infinite, which the Underſtanding cannot maſter. But ſince it is very plain that all things in the World come under the diſtribution of finite or infinite, or that which hath a beginning, or that which hath not a beginning and is conſequently eternal; If I can (as moſt certainly I may) have a conception of what is finite, and what are the Laws and neceſſary Connexions of it, I can by that Notion conclude that whatſoever is finite, or that muſt be under the Laws and Rules of finite Beings, cannot be infinite: I have a Globe in my Hand, though I know not the Eternity, yet I know that whatſoever hath or muſt neceſſarily have limits or <hi>fines,</hi> is not, cannot be infinite, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Globe cannot be infinite: And if I can find in any other thing a parity of Reaſon, I do and may remove infiniteneſs from it as reaſonably and evidently as I do from this Globe I hold, or this Hour I write, or this Life I live: I do therefore certainly know that whatſoever is limited or bounded by ſomewhat that neceſſarily anteceded it, cannot be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>I do not determin what Eternal or Infinite is in the Poſitive nature of it, only I remove Infinitude from what I find to be neceſſarily finite; and determin, that whatſoever hath bounds or limits to it, is <hi>quid finitum,</hi> and not <hi>quid non finitum;</hi> and whatſoever hath neceſſarily a beginning is <hi>quid temporale,</hi> and not <hi>quid aeternum:</hi> And all my endeavour hath been to ſhew that the things before diſputed are and needs muſt be of ſuch a nature as comes under the notion of what I know, namely, <hi>finitum</hi> or <hi>temporale;</hi> and not under the negation thereof, namely, <hi>infinitum,</hi> or <hi>non finitum,</hi> or <hi>fine principio.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>2. <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </label> That by denying the poſſibility at leaſt of Eternity to created ſucceſſive Beings, I put a reſtraint to the infinite Goodneſs of God, who thereby is ſtraitned in the communication of his Goodneſs, coeternal to his being, which is part of his Divine Perfection; and alſo to the extent of his Power and Omnipotence: which is too bold and adventurous.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Touching the Goodneſs of God, and the neceſſity of his communication thereof, I have before ſaid enough in the Second Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, I ſhall not repeat it: But as touching the other reſtraint upon his Omnipotence, I ſay, the denying of Power in God to make a Creature, eſpecially a ſucceſſive created Nature as ancient as himſelf, is no more a derogation from his Power, than to deny him Power to make a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as great, and as good, and as powerful as himſelf: The Infiniteneſs of his Duration is a part of the Divine Perfection (in my judgment) incommunicable to any created Being, and it is part of the eminence, and excellence, and tranſcendence of that Divine Perfection, as well as others that are not communicable to any created Being. But ſecondly,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64147:65"/>
Suppoſe that Eternity might be communicated to any created Being, as for the purpoſe, to the more pure Mental Natures, yet I do not diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Omnipotence of God when I ſay it is not communicable to a ſucceſſive Being that is <hi>in fluxu;</hi> not for want of Power in God, but for want of Capacity in the nature of the thing to ſuſtain ſuch a duration upon the intrinſecal diſcongruity of the one to the other: It would not be a derogation to the Divine Omnipotence, to deny that the Diagonal of a Square ſhould be commenſurate in length to the Sides; for the nature of the thing will not bear it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>3. <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </label> But a late Author hath with oſtentation enough produced an Argument whereby all thoſe Reaſons and Inſtances concerning the impoſſibility and abſurdity of infinite Generations, infinite Individuals, and infinite Motion ſuppoſed to have actually exiſted, are eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; and therefore he concludes, that notwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid, the Generations of Men might have been actually eternal, and that there may be infinite numbers of ſucceſſive Men, Generations and Revolutions, and that conſequently it is not repugnant that infinite may be greater than infinite; that there be infinite Days, and Years, and Men, and yet in that infinite 365 times more Days than Years, yet both infinite; the number of Men infinite, and yet the number of their Hands or Eyes double to the number of the Men: That the Suppoſition that theſe are contradictions, are but miſtakes and deluſions of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding not able well to digeſt the buſineſs of Eternal, Immenſe, or Infinite. And this he thinks he proves by two principal Inſtances which he thinks are unqueſtionable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is and would be ſuch a thing as Duration, and that duration would be ſucceſſive though there were no being <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> which he calls <hi>tempus aeternum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is unqueſtionably an infinite Space actually: And yet all theſe imaginary conſequences and abſurdities follow upon that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which are urged as the Reaſons againſt the ſucceſſive eternal duration of Individuals above mentioned: For in that infinite ſpace there are infinite Miles and infinite Leagues, and yet thrice ſo many Miles as Leagues: The extent at both the extremes of Eaſt and Weſt infinite; yet each extreme divided, infinite: and many ſuch the like Inſtances, which yet notwithſtanding avoid not the truth of an infinite extenſion.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer briefly in this place, (for I have elſewhere examined at large the truth of both theſe <hi>Hypotheſes</hi>) I do in the firſt place premiſe, That as the exceſs (as I may call it) of Being, namely Infinitude, is difficult to apprehend; ſo the defect of Being, namely Nothing, is very difficult to apprehend: When we go about to apprehend ſimple No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet our Imagination clothes it with ſomething like Exiſtence, and gives imaginary being to Nothing, before we can come to ſhape a thought concerning it.</p>
               <p>And certainly Duration and Space are in themſelves relative to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that doth <hi>durare,</hi> and ſomething that is <hi>ſpatiatum,</hi> namely, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extended: And if any (thing I cannot ſay) but if any Conceptible is more nothing than another, Duration without a thing that dureth, and Space without a thing that is extended in it, is the verieſt, the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteſt Nothing that can be: While they are in conjunction with the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64147:65"/>
thing that ſuſtains them, they are the meaneſt Being that is, for they are but modes of being; and therefore when the things that muſt ſuſtain them are not, they are the pureſt nothing that can undergo the notion of Nothing.</p>
               <p>To ſay there is a duration, whether ſucceſſive, or permanent, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible, when there is nothing that doth ſuſtain that duration, is a Phantaſm of Nothing under the notion of Something: For it is moſt apparent to any man that will but lay aſide the Phantaſm, That the duration of every thing is diverſified in relation to it ſelf, according to the nature of the thing that endures; and though it coexiſts with a thing that appropriates another kind of duration, as ſuitable to its being, yet it retains ſtill its own duration, as appropriate to it ſelf. Thus the duration of the glorious God is another kind of duration than that of Motion or Bodies, and yet it coexiſts with that duration. Nay poſſibly the duration of a permanent Being (we will take it, a piece of Gold) hath another kind of duration than that of Motion, that is ſucceſſive: So that all the notion that we have of Duration without relation to ſomething that endures, is a fiction that the Underſtanding takes up, and the Image whereby it conceives it, is partly by the ſucceſſiveneſs of its own operations, and partly by thoſe external meaſures that it finds in Motion, rendred a ſucceſſive Nature, and <hi>pars poſt partem:</hi> And thus the imaginative Underſtanding dreſſeth up a Nothing, namely, Duration without a thing that endures, and then attributes to it what ſhe finds in her ſelf, and the things ſhe converſeth with, namely Succeſſion; when really there is no ſuch thing as duration or ſucceſſive duration, unleſs there is ſomething that doth ſo endure.</p>
               <p>And that this is nothing elſe but a creature of the Imagination appears by this: No man alive can ſuppoſe that there is any exiſtence of duration that is to be a thouſand years hence, it reſts meerly in poſſibility; yet the Imagination will dreſs up that future duration under certain proportions that it borrows from the things it ſees and converſeth with.</p>
               <p>And what is ſaid of Duration without a Body that dures, is in truth to be ſaid of Space without a Body to which it relates, and therefore well called <hi>ſpatium imaginarium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The juſt apprehenſion of Space ſeems to be this; That whereſoever there is a Body actually exiſting to which Space relateth, there is an actual ſpace: And therefore if we ſhould ſuppoſe nothing to be beyond the convex Superficies of the laſt Heaven, yet the immediate contiguity of that convex to nothing were a real ſpace, becauſe it denotes a true relation to that which is, namely, the convex Superficies of the higheſt Arch of being: Nay, if we ſhould ſuppoſe <figure/> that the Univerſe were perfectly ſpherical, and another Univerſe of the ſame dimenſion and figure were created contiguous to it, as <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B,</hi> though they were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous only in the point of contingency, yet their two imaginary Poles <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D</hi> would have really a ſpace between, which would be commenſurate to the Semidiameter of both Spheres; for ſtill there is a real diſtance between the parts of two Bodies, and from that relation
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64147:66"/>
ariſeth a real ſpace: So if the Air within a concave Sphere or Cube were annihilated or not there, yet there would be a real ſpace between the ſides of the Cube or Sphere though no Body intervened, becauſe ſtill there remained the ambient ſides, to which that ſpace may as well relate and be commenſurate, as if the vacant ſpace were full of Air.</p>
               <p>But without relation to ſome Body, there can be no actual Space; for Space is a term meerly of relation to ſomething that is <hi>ſpatiatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then comes in the Author, and brings <hi>Lucretius</hi> with him, and tells us, that before the World was there was Space, or otherwiſe how could there be room for the Univerſe unleſs there were ſpace to receive it: and ſuppoſeth that if an Archer were upon the convex Superficies of the Heaven there would be ſpace for him, and if he ſhot his Arrow upward, there would be ſpace for that Arrow to fly, or elſe the Arrow would not move from the ſtring.</p>
               <p>And all this is very true, and yet it proves nothing of real Space beyond the confines and relation of Bodies.</p>
               <p>But as in relation to the infinite active Power of God, nothing had (as it were) a paſſive potentiality to be ſomething, to be a Body, to be a World; ſo conſequently nothing had a potentiality, as I may call it, to become Space when the World was made, and together with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Body there was a production of Space: As if at this day in the ſunſhine there ſhould be produced an opacous Body, together with it the ſhadow would be produced: and as the ſhadow, though really no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when there was no opacous Body, had a kind of potentiality to be, upon the exiſtence of that Body; ſo this abyſs of Nothing had a kind of potentiality to be Space, when ſomething was produced to which it might have relation, as <hi>quid ſpatiatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſame Anſwer is moſt clearly evident, as to <hi>Lucretius</hi> his Archer.</p>
               <p>There was nothing, and therefore no ſpace, till the Archer came to the convex of the uppermoſt Heaven, but only a potentiality, if I may ſo call it, to receive him when he was there; and when he ſhot up his Arrow, that ſpace that really was not before, but only potentially to ſerve a Body when it comes there, now becomes ſpace for the flight and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his Arrow; but when it was returned, now the ſpace no more exiſted for the Arrow, nor for the Archer after his coming from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex of the higheſt Heaven: ſo that though nothing may be ſpace when it hath a Body to which it may relate, yet till that relation it is not ſpace, but nothing.</p>
               <p>And certainly that which impoſeth upon perſons to aſſert an infinite Space, is this: Their Imagination and Phantaſie doth firſt create a Phantaſm, that doth <hi>ſubire vices corporis,</hi> and they fill an imaginary ſpace or an imaginary extenſion with that Phantaſm, and then indeed they have got an imaginary ſpace; I ſay, their Phantaſie and Imagination follows the conception of the imaginary ſpace with an imaginary exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, either ſuppoſing the World infinitely extended, or elſe fancying the Archer and the Arrow, and when that is handſomly fancied, the Phantaſm it ſelf doth effectually in the Imagination ſerve the turn to make up a relation between a Body and it, though really there be neither infinite Body, nor infinite Space, till the Body comes to give it its relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:64147:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>And if men will needs be concluding, that becauſe I cannot deliver my ſelf from the apprehenſion of ſpace <hi>ultra pomoeria coeli,</hi> therefore it muſt be ſuppoſed really to be; we ſhall find another imagination hardly able to deliver it ſelf from the apprehenſion of ſomething beyond the laſt Heavens, and again ſomething beyond that, becauſe it cannot frame to it ſelf an apprehenſion of nothing, or of any ſpace to be without a Body in it; and ſo upon the ſame reaſon prove the World infinitely extended.</p>
               <p>And yet I appeal to the Phantaſie of theſe very men which either ſuppoſe an infinite empty Space, or an infinite World, whether they can bring their Imagination to ſuch a diſcipline as to ſuppoſe this Infinitude all together, but are fain to go on from one ſtep to another, and to think firſt of a ſpace larger than the Heavens, and then of a ſpace larger than that, and ſo gradually; ſo that if Imagination ſhould be a ſufficient <hi>medium</hi> to prove a real exiſtence, it would only prove an indefinite ſpace or extenſion, not a ſpace or extenſion actually infinite; for Imagination will never be able <hi>per ſaltum</hi> to conceive actually Infinite, nor without an Image of Exiſtence to conceive that which actually is not.</p>
               <p>Therefore it ſeems to me to be too precarious an Argumentation againſt the ſtrong evidence of Reaſon, to prove the exiſtence of an infinite Space or infinite Body, barely by bold affirming it; or becauſe a man's Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, or Imagination, or Intellect being accuſtomed to the knowledge only of things extended and real ſpace, cannot deliver it ſelf from the thought of an imaginary ſpace or extent, though there were nothing in the World to ſuſtain it.</p>
               <p>And upon this account a late Excellent Author hath uſed a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous <hi>medium</hi> to prove a moſt certain and important Truth, namely, the exiſtence of God, becauſe there was really a Space before the World was created: Whereas firſt of all, there could be no Space without a Body; and ſecondly, if there could be ſuch a Space, it were of a diviſible exiſtence, which could hold no proportion with the indiviſible nature of the glorious God; Space being <hi>quid extenſum,</hi> and diviſible; but the Eſſence of God purely ſpiritual and indiviſible, and equally immenſe, whether there were a World or no World, Space or no Space.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>4. The Fourth <hi>Objection</hi> is this:</label> That it ſeems that it is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent that one Infinite ſhould be larger than another, and yet both infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: Inſtances may be given of two kinds; 1. One Infinite in Intenſion may be larger than another; there are degrees of perfection in Created Natures, a Brute is more perfect than a Vegetable, and a Man more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than a Brute; and an Angel more perfect than a Man, and one Angel more perfect than another, at leaſt gradually; and conſequently the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Almighty God muſt more infinitely exceed the perfection of a Man than it doth of an Angel, and more infinitely exceed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of an Angel of an inferiour Order than an Angel of the ſupremeſt Order, and yet He infinitely exceeds the perfection of the moſt perfect Angel. 2. In Extenſion, or ſomewhat analogal to it: Certainly <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Eternal God had an eternal duration the firſt moment that he had Created the World as he hath now, and yet with Humility and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in ſo great a Myſtery, we may ſay, and that truly, that he hath endured at this day above five thouſand years longer than he had endured
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64147:67"/>
at the Creation of the World: ſo that it is not repugnant to the nature of Eternity to be longer or ſhorter.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That for the obviating of this difficulty I have willingly declined that Inſtance againſt the eternal ſucceſſion of Mankind that purely conſiſts upon the account of additional acceſſions to the latter end, as I may call it, of Eternal Duration.</p>
               <p>But firſt, I ſay that this anſwers not at all the Reaſon given, the ſtreſs whereof reſts not upon the incompetibility of an exceſs of one Infinitude above another either in Intenſion or Extenſion, but the incompetibility of any multitude to be infinite; becauſe it is impoſſible that any number or multitude can be infinite if there can be another multitude or number given that exceeds it, which will fall out in the ſucceſſive Individuals and Generations of Men: But the glorious God, as he is moſt ſimply and indiviſibly One, and all his Perfections eſſentially and indiviſibly the ſame with his moſt One and indiviſible Being; ſo the infinite exceſſes both of his Eſſential Perfections and of his Eternal Duration beyond all other Beings, are not meaſurable by multitude or number of degrees or ſucceſſive moments, which would in it ſelf imply either parts or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, but exceeds them all by an infinite interval that neither hath nor can have any bounds or limits: As his Perfection is infinitely greater than the perfection of a Man, ſo it is infinitely greater than the perfection of an Angel; and were it not infinitely greater than the perfection of an Angel, it could not be infinitely greater than the perfection of a Man, becauſe the intenſive diſtance between the perfection of an Angel and of a Man is but finite: And therefore though that interval between an Angelical and a Humane perfection be ſubducted out of the extent of the Divine Perfection, ſtill the extent of the Divine Perfection is infinite; for what is ſo ſubtracted or ſubducted out of the extent of the Divine Perfection, leaves ſtill a Quotient, if I may ſo call it, Infinite.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which gives a clear Anſwer to the Inſtance is this: The Perfection of Almighty God is a Primitive Eſſential Perfection, antecedent to all created perfection; and all created perfection is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection indeed given by the glorious God, according to ſuch meaſures-and degrees as he is pleaſed to beſtow: But as it is a derivative perfection, ſo it is a diſtinct kind of perfection from that which is in God, and of another nature, and makes no alteration in the Divine Perfection, nor borrows any of it: The glorious God was equally perfect before a Brute, or a Man, or an Angel, or a World was created, as he was after; and the production of Creatures of various degrees of eſſential perfection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes nothing to it, nor takes any thing from it, nor makes any alteration in it: only it gives a new or farther relation from the Creature new created unto the Creator, and that in thoſe various ranks or decrees of perfection is indeed diverſified by diſparity in the Creatures themſelves, and in that comparative preference that one hath above another; but ſtill it is without and below the eſſential infinite Perfection of God, and doth no way affect or alter it. Take this Example in ſome meaſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my meaning; I have a Rod of ſix foot long in my Hand, I take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rod of four foot, another of two foot long, and apply them to my Rod of ſix foot long; I thereby find that my Rod of four foot takes up a greater ſpace upon my Rod of ſix foot than that of two foot, yet it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64147:67"/>
makes no alteration in my Rod of ſix foot, but that continues of the ſame length as before, only by the application of the ſhorter Rods to it there ariſeth a new relation, or rather variety of compariſon between the Rod of ſix foot and the other Rods. Thus the Divine Perfection is primitive, abſolute, unchangeable; and when a Man is created, there is a Creature made that hath a perfection greater than a Brute, and when an Angel is created, he hath a perfection greater than a Man, and thereby comes in a nearer degree or likeneſs of perfection to the Divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence than a Man doth; but yet it doth not at all alter that Perfection that is primitively and eſſentially and infinitely in Almighty God, but is a perfection of quite another kind as well as degree.</p>
               <p>And upon the ſame account it is, that although the extent of the Divine Duration is now greater than it was five or ten thouſand years ſince, yet the duration of the Divine Exiſtence was no leſs infinite ten thouſand years ſince than it is now; becauſe the duration of ten thouſand years is but finite, and therefore though taken out of an infinite duration, leaves ſtill the duration infinite; for finite taken out of infinite, leaves ſtill that which remains infinite.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the duration of the glorious God is the duration of ſuch a Being as is indiviſible, and as he hath no diviſibility in himſelf, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is his Eternal Duration diviſible into parts.</p>
               <p>It is true, that when his own Power hath produced a World, and with it Motion, he coexiſts with that Motion and ſucceſſive Duration of created Being, which is little elſe beſides a relation to the things exiſting: And therefore he cannot be ſaid now to coexiſt with that which yet is not, but ſhall be, becauſe the coexiſtence with any thing imports an exiſtence of both the terms of that relation: And although by reaſon of that relation to Beings that are ſucceſſive and have ſucceſſion of parts, as Local Motion, or ſucceſſive Generations; it ſeems to us that he hath a kind of ſucceſſion in his duration, yet moſt certainly the exiſtence of a diviſible ſucceſſion in created Beings doth no more make his duration ſucceſſive than if nothing had been beſides himſelf: As the unſucceſſive duration of Almighty God with relation to himſelf, which is the <hi>modus exiſtentiae divinae,</hi> doth not communicate unto Motion or other created Being the ſame manner of duration which is appropriate to the Divine Exiſtence; ſo neither doth the exiſtence of Motion or created Beings transfer to the Divine Being ſuch a kind of duration as is proper to them, namely, a diviſible ſucceſſive duration conſiſting of ſucceſſive and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable parts: For, as I before have obſerved, the duration of every thing, which is only the mode of its exiſtence or <hi>permanentiae in ſuo eſſe,</hi> is diverſified according to the nature of the <figure/> exiſtence thereof. And though by reaſon of the coexiſtence of one thing with another there ariſeth a various relation or connotation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, yet it alters not that intrinſecal manner of duration that is appropriate to the Eſſences of the things themſelves.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould ſuppoſe the Circle <hi>A B C</hi> to move about a fixed unmoveable Center at <hi>D,</hi> whereby the part that is now in <hi>A,</hi> an hour
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64147:68"/>
hence will be at <hi>B,</hi> and an hour after that at <hi>C,</hi> and thereby is gained ſucceſſively different relations of ſite or poſition between the fixed or ſtable central Body at <hi>D,</hi> yet it is without any variation either of <hi>ſitus</hi> or motion in the central Body at <hi>D,</hi> which all this while reſts unmoveable, and keeps the ſame unaltered ſite or poſition in it ſelf: So it is in the coexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of ſucceſſive Beings with the indiviſible, fixed, permanent ſtate of the glorious God.</p>
               <p>But in all this there is nothing that anſwers or weakens the Reaſon before given againſt the Eternity of ſucceſſive Generations or Individuals, which is not upon this account, that that which is eternal cannot be extended to a greater extent at the hithermoſt and concluding extreme, as I may call it, for at the hither end it is <hi>quaſi quid finitum;</hi> but that thoſe Beings that muſt by their ſucceſſive exiſtence <hi>excreſcere in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem ſive numerum,</hi> cannot be eternal upon a certain intrinſick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity between Multitude and Number of the one part, and Infinite of the other part: But in the eternal duration of the glorious God there is neither Multitude, nor ſo much as Succeſſion. And this is my ſecond Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. My third Anſwer is this: That although it may be, and certainly is conſiſtent with an eternal duration, that it may be ſhorter, or it may be longer upon the hither end thereof, namely, that extreme wherein it is finite, as is before ſhewn; yet it is impoſſible to be conſiſtent with the very notion of an eternal duration to be longer or ſhorter, <hi>à parte ante,</hi> in the extreme or remote part thereof, as I may call it; for upon that Suppoſition it ſhould be <hi>utrinque clauſa,</hi> terminated in the moment wherein I write, and terminated or limited by an antecedent being or duration of ſomething elſe: (With Reverence be it ſpoken) If any thing in the compaſs of Nature might bear an eternal Creation, yet if that Creation were but a moment after the Divine Exiſtence, that created Being could not be eternal becauſe it had a pre-exiſtence of the Divine Being before it: Nay, though I uſe the expreſſion of an antecedent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to render my conception, yet that very imaginable moment muſt be an infinite duration antecedent to that created Being; and it could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be otherwiſe; for if it were poſſible to be otherwiſe, it would conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deny the Eternity of God himſelf: for that created Being being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be eternal, ſince it muſt, <hi>ex ſuppoſitione,</hi> have a pre-exiſting moment of the Divine Exiſtence, if that <hi>mora prae-exiſtentiae divinae</hi> were not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but a moment, or any limited duration leſs than eternal and infinite, it would be but an addition of a limited time to a limited or non-eternal time; and therefore cannot be eternal (and here by the way, the Eternal, Incomprehenſible Generation of the Son, and Proceſſion of the Holy Spirit are no way concerned in this Diſpute, which are not created Beings, nor diſtinct from the Divine Eſſence, or eſſentially diſtinct from one another, but One Incomprehenſible God Bleſſed for ever) though under a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal diſtinction.</p>
               <p>This therefore being the true ſtate of the matter, the Reaſon herein given doth not at all infirm the important Reaſon againſt the Eternity of Mankind, becauſe neceſſarily there would upon ſuch a Suppoſition follow an Eternity that had a beginning, an Eternity that was puiſne to ſome other thing or ſome other Eternal: And that although that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64147:68"/>
duration which is infinite in one extreme, namely, <hi>à parte ante,</hi> and finite at another extreme, namely by the preſent time, may have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, acceſſion, or addition in that part in which, it is finite; yet it is impoſſible that it ſhould have any thing before it in that extreme wherein its Infinity and Eternity conſiſted. This is the chief ſtreſs of the former Debate, which is no way impugned by the Inſtance here given; for the glorious God and his Eternal Exiſtence is ſuch, that it hath not, cannot have any thing antecedent to it; neither is it meaſured by ſucceſſive parts, but is ſimply eternal, infinite, before all things, without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Being or Duration as well as without end; and ſuch a Duration, as it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe any thing before it, or any thing equally ancient to it; but ever was, and ever had Being or Exiſtence, that is, eternally and immutably the ſame; what once he was he ever was, ſtill is, and ever ſhall be.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>5. A Fifth <hi>Objection</hi> is this:</label> That becauſe we have formerly ſuppoſed that nothing can poſſibly be eternal, and together with it have variety of Operations. The glorious Eternal God hath variety of Operations in all the Works of Creation and Providence, his emanant Actions; and alſo in the Counſels and Determination of his Will, his immanent Actions: And therefore the Poſition ſeems to be derogatory to the Eternity of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
               <p>I had not inſerted this <hi>Objection</hi> but for the fuller vindication of the Truth, and to ſhew, that it no way in the leaſt imaginable degree derogates from the Truths concerning God.</p>
               <p>I therefore anſwer, that when we are ſpeaking of alterations or changes, it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be one of theſe kinds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An alteration that with it carries a change of the Nature or Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a thing; and thus in a large ſenſe generation or corruption, or the eſſential change of any thing or Being into another thing; thus corporeal Matter under any determinate form is changeable, and ſuch a mutability is impoſſible to be conſiſtent with Eternity: and it is thus impoſſible for the glorious God to be ſubject to any change, for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and therefore eternally exiſts, and muſt ever exiſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An alteration of ſtates or conditions of any Being, which yet as to its eſſential condition perſiſts as before: thus Bodies are every moment changed, ſometimes in quality, as from hot to cold, ſometimes in figure, ſometimes in dimenſions, as the motions of augmentation and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution: a Child grows unto the ſtature of a Youth, and then of a Man; and ſuch Beings as theſe cannot ſuſtain an eternal duration, <hi>à parte ante:</hi> and in this reſpect the ever-glorious God is perfectly unchangeable, without ſo much as a ſhadow of change, but eternally and immutably the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A change of the internal and immanent acts of the Underſtanding and Will in a Being endued therewith; as to know that which before it knew not, to will, purpoſe, or determin what before it willed not or purpoſed not. The Schoolmen are indeed many of them a Generation of Men that think they can give an eſtimate of the manner of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Operations, even thoſe that are immanent, when yet God knows 'tis more poſſible for the Infant of a ſpan long to diſcern and underſtand
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64147:69"/>
and define and determin the moſt ſublime and abſtruſe Notions of the moſt Seraphical Doctor, than for ſuch a Doctor to give an eſtimate of the hidden Operations of the Divine Intellect and Will: And therefore they are too bold to adventure upon ſuch determinations touching theſe Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the glorious God; and in the upſhot arrive at nothing touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them but preſumptuous, uncertain and dangerous Speculations: and it muſt needs be ſo, for as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo and much more are the thoughts of the unſearchable God higher than our thoughts. The more ſober and weighty part of the Schoolmen do conclude this Queſtion in the negative, and aſſert, That Almighty God by one eternal act knew all things from all Eternity, and by the like eternal act willed from all Eternity what he any way willed; and though the termination of that Will reſpected Objects that neither were nor could be eternal, yet his Knowledge and Will was eternally the ſame as ever; and he begins not to know any thing which he did not eternally know, nor to will any thing which he did not eternally will, though the execution of that Will reſpects things to be done in time and futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And certainly as this is the moſt probable Opinion, ſo it takes away the pretence of the Objection; the immanent Acts and Operations of the glorious God being eternal and without change.</p>
               <p>It is true, ſome late Schoolmen, and after them <hi>Clara</hi> in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Problem</hi> ſeems to aſſert, that, <hi>Divina voluntas potest velle aliquid novum ſine mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione ſui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that this Suppoſition were admiſſible, yet this would not any way be inconſiſtent with the Eternity of the Divine Nature and Eſſence: 1. This is no Phyſical change in Almighty God, but a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and free operation of his Will, which poſſibly was ſo at firſt willed by him to be changed according as he ſaw cauſe in his infinite Wiſdom. 2. That this which is here called a change of his Will, is not in truth a change of his Will, but a change in the Object, which only ſeems to make a diverſification of the Will, but indeed is the ſame Will diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied only in the habitude to the Object. The Will of God is like a ſtraight unalterable Rule or Line, but the various comportments of the Creature either thwarting this Rule or holding conformity to it, occaſions ſeveral habitudes of this Rule unto it. We need no better explication hereof than that of the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> Chap. 33. from the twelfth to the twentieth Verſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A change of Actions and Operations in relation to ſome external Object, or terminated therein; and ſuch a change as this is conſiſtent with an Eternal Being, though the change happen in any given portion of Time: Thus the Almighty and Eternal God created the World by his Power and Will in the beginning of Time, and orders, governs and diſpoſeth of the things by his Providence in all the Periods of Time, and yet without any Phyſical or real change in himſelf. And thus he began to be a Creator, when before he was not a Creator; and began to be a Governour of the World after it was made, and exerciſeth divers external acts of his Providence daily which before he did not. For thoſe various acts of his are terminated in ſuch Objects as neither were nor could be eternal, namely, the World and the Government thereof: And although he thereby gain a change of relation or relative denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64147:69"/>
yet it is no real or Phyſical change in himſelf. For all relations ariſe from the ſuppoſition of exiſtence of both the terms of relation, as between the Creator and the thing created, and the Governour and thing governed; and therefore although one of the terms of that relation, namely the Eternal God, had an eternal exiſtence in his own abſolute nature; yet the World, that was the other term of relation, had no eternal exiſtence, but was created in the beginning of Time, and the relation of a Creator or Governour muſt neceſſarily therefore ariſe in Time, and not from Eternity, becauſe one of the terms of the relation, namely the World, had not any exiſtence before Time began.</p>
               <p>But in the eternal Generation of the Son and Proceſſion of the Holy Spirit, the <hi>termini relationis</hi> were all eternal, and conſequently the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Paternity and Filiation between the Firſt and Second Perſon, and the relation between the Sacred Perſons of the Trinity and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination thereof muſt needs be eternal, becauſe the terms of relation between whom that relation ariſeth were eternal: But it is not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Eternal God and a temporary World, for the relation could not ariſe till the World had an exiſtence; and a change or acqueſt of a new relation is not at all any real change in God, but is an accident reſulting from the exiſtence of both the <hi>termini,</hi> and can be no ancienter than the coexiſtence even of the lateſt and neweſt of thoſe terms, which if began in time muſt neceſſarily produce a new relation, yet without any real change in the pre-exiſting and eternal God.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with thoſe Phyſical and Metaphyſical Evidences of the Inception of the World and of Mankind, and againſt the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of both. And although I ſhall deſcend in the enſuing Section to Moral Evidences of probability ſtrongly perſwading the ſame Truth, yet I lay the principal weight and ſtreſs of this Argument upon what is ſaid in the preceding Chapters of this Firſt Section, which though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance they may have ſomething of obſcurity, as being bottomed upon and fetched from the true nature of the things themſelves, and therefore not ſo obvious and plain to all Capacities, yet they have a concludency in them not inferior, or at leaſt little inferior to Demonſtrations.</p>

               <p>I Have now done with thoſe Evidences that in my Underſtanding ſeem, <hi>quaſi ab intrinſeco,</hi> to evince the Inception of Mankind from that intrinſecal incompoſſibility and inconſiſtency that the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the eternal exiſtence thereof bears with his Nature: I now deſcend to the examination of thoſe Evidences of Fact, which do or may ſeem to contribute to the proof of what is deſigned, namely, <hi>Novitatem generis humani.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although that Evidences of Fact of things remote from our Senſe cannot be ſaid infallible and demonſtrative, becauſe the nature of ſuch matters of fact (ſimply as they are matters of fact) is not capable (as ſuch) of Demonſtration; yet they may be Evidences of high cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, and ſuch as no reaſonable Man can with any juſt reaſon deny his aſſent unto them.</p>
               <p>That which hath been, hath as certainly and infallibly, yea and as neceſſarily been, as that which is: <hi>Omne quod, eſt, dum eſt neceſſariò eſt, &amp; omne quod fuit, cum jam preteriit neceſſariò fuit quando fuit, &amp; in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritis non eſt contingentia.</hi> Only that which is, and is obvious to Senſe, hath this advantage of evidence which that which hath been wants, namely, the immediate evidence of Senſe, wherein though it is not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally impoſſible but that Senſe may be deceived, yet becauſe it is the beſt evidence that we have of matters of fact, we give credit to it as a ſenſible evidence, and we have reaſon ſo to do.</p>
               <p>But of things tranſacted before our time, and out of the immediate reach of our Senſe, we may have ſuch an evidence as in reaſon we ought as reaſonable Men to acquieſce in, though the evidence be ſtill in its own nature but moral, and not ſimply demonſtrative or infallible: And the variety of circumſtances renders the credibility of ſuch things more or leſs, according to the various ingredients and contributions of credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that are concentred in ſuch an evidence.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to demonſtrate by evidence infallible (or which is all one, by evidence that is impoſſible to be falſe) that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, or King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, or that ſuch a Man was his Father, or ſuch a Woman his Mother; or that there is ſuch a City as <hi>Venice,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> (to me that never ſaw it,) for all theſe I have but by relation from others, and it is not impoſſible but thoſe Hiſtories or informations or relations by which I am informed of theſe things may be falſe: And
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64147:70"/>
they are ſuch matters as have in them a leſs evidence than my own Senſe of Sight; for the evidence of my Senſe is ſimple and immediate, and therefore I have but a ſhorter cut thereby to the aſſent to the truth of the things ſo evidenced: But in things that I have by relation from others, my evidence is of greater diſtance; for firſt, I ſee them not by my own Eyes, but it is others that muſt firſt ſee the thing they relate; and ſecondly, though I ſhould think that whatſoever might be believed, if obvious to the Senſe of others, might have as great a credibility as if obvious to my own, yet I muſt have a ſecond poſtulation that muſt have an ingredient to elicit my aſſent, namely, the veracity of him that reports and relates it. And hence it is, that that which is reported by many Eye-witneſſes hath greater motives of credibility than that which is reported by few; that which is reported by credible and authentick witneſſes, than that which is reported by light and inconſiderable witneſſes; that which is reported by perſons diſintereſſed, than that which is reported by perſons whoſe intereſt it is to have the thing true, or believed to be true; that which hath the concurring teſtimony of real exiſting monuments, than that which is without them; and finally, that which is reported by credible perſons of their own view, than that which they receive by hear-ſay from thoſe that report upon their own view: So that it is not with Evidences of Fact as it is with Logical or Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, which ſeem to conſiſt in indiviſibles, for that which thus is demonſtratively true is impoſſible to be falſe; but Moral Evidence is gradual, according to the variety of circumſtances. Yet ſuch a man would be exploded as an irrational man, that will not believe there was ſuch a man as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> becauſe the Hiſtorians that write of him might poſſibly conſpire to deceive the World with a Romance, or that the Books may be ſuppoſititious or corrupted; or will not believe that ſuch a Man was his Father, or ſuch a Woman his Mother, becauſe he might be ſuppoſititious; or will not believe there is ſuch a City as <hi>Rome,</hi> which he never ſaw, becauſe Travellers are wont to love to tell ſtrange things, and ſo may many as well as one.</p>
               <p>So that as eternal Truths may have one kind of certainty by Logical Demonſtration, and as Mathematical Concluſions have an infallible certainty by Mathematical Demonſtration, and as matters objected im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to our Senſe have another kind of certainty by ſenſible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſo matters ſimply of fact not objected immediately to our Senſe have another kind of certainty, though not altogether equal to the former, nor ſimply infallible, yet ſo highly credible that may juſtly elicit the aſſent of reaſonable men, and ſuch as is proportionate to the nature of the thing, and therefore more cannot be reaſonably expected for the proof of the fact.</p>
               <p>In the purſuance of this Argument, namely, Evidences of Fact touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Origination of Mankind, I muſt therefore ſay that the Evidences thereof are not of an infallible certainty, and ſo much the rather becauſe it relates to a matter that at the neareſt that can be ſuppoſed is near ſix thouſand years diſtant from us, and ſome ſuppoſe more; therefore the Evidences of Fact are as it were percolated through a vaſt Period of Ages, and many very obſcure to us. And therefore all Proofs of this kind except that of Divine Revelation (which though true, and infallibly true,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64147:71"/>
we muſt not by the Laws of Argumentation bring in here, becauſe at one word it determins the Queſtion) will ariſe to no higher than Moral, and therefore fallible in their own nature. We reſt upon what hath been before ſaid for Evidences and Reaſons, that to me ſeem demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative.</p>
               <p>But yet the Evidences of Fact which we ſhall produce muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered alſo with theſe Advantages for their credibility.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are ſuch as bear a great congruity and conſonancy with, and ſubſervience to thoſe former Arguments that <hi>ex natura rei</hi> and <hi>intrinſecè</hi> prove an impoſſibility of an eternal duration of Mankind, <hi>à parte ante,</hi> which though it doth not, cannot evince that Mankind muſt have their Origination or Beginning <hi>in hac vel iſta hora,</hi> yet they do evince that Beginning it muſt have, and the evidences of fact are as ſo many <hi>teſtes, conteſtes,</hi> or <hi>ſuffragiales,</hi> that bear witneſs to that Truth that the former ſort of Arguments do plainly evince.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though theſe Evidences of Fact taken ſingly and apart, are not without their Objections that may ſeem to weaken them, yet <hi>juncta ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:</hi> That evidence at Law which taken ſingly or apart makes but an imperfect proof, <hi>ſemiplena probatio,</hi> yet in conjunction with others grow to a full proof, like <hi>Silurus</hi> his twigs, that were eaſily broken apart, but in conjunction or union were not to be broken.</p>
               <p>Truths (eſpecially of Fact) are not made Truths by Arguments or Evidence; If there were once ſuch a man as <hi>Caeſar,</hi> it is moſt certainly true that he was, though no Hiſtorian ever mentioned him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there were ten thouſand Authors that mention him kept ſacredly and inviolably in certain Archives unto this day, all this evidence doth not make him to be, but only gives us a light and evidence of great probability that he was: The Stars in the Milky-way, and thoſe <hi>Aſſeclae Jovis</hi> are not therefore in the Heavens or <hi>Aether,</hi> becauſe the Teleſcope hath diſcovered them, for they were there before; but the poſition of thoſe Glaſſes preſent them to our perception, and evidence their being, which cannot be diſcovered without them.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is with Evidences of Fact, they do not make the thing to be, but evidence them to be; and becauſe if to any one <hi>quaeſitum</hi> of fact there be many but probable evidences, which taken ſingly have not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance any full evidence, yet when many of thoſe evidences concur and concenter in the evidence of the ſame thing, their very multiplicity and conſent makes the evidence the ſtronger; as the concurrent teſtimonies of many Witneſſes or many Circumſtances even by their multiplicity and concurrence make an evidence more concludent.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Evidences of Fact I ſhall caſt into theſe ranks.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have no authentical Hiſtory of former Ages extant, but what hath been written within the compaſs of four thouſand years.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſubject matter of thoſe Hiſtories give us no account of the Original of great Monarchies, Kingdoms, or Commonwealths, but what appear thereby to have begun within the compaſs of about five thouſand years.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The original Invention and Inventors of moſt conſiderable Arts had their Origination, as far as we can find, by Monuments of ancient times, within the compaſs of about ſix thouſand years.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:64147:71"/>4. The Original of the <hi>Apotheoſes</hi> of moſt of the Heathen fictitious Deities appears by the ancient Monuments of former times to have had their beginning within the compaſs of five thouſand years.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The moſt authentick Hiſtories and Monuments of Antiquity give us an account of the firſt Fathers, or <hi>Capita familiarum,</hi> and of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the known Parts, Continents and Iſlands of the World within the compaſs of five thouſand years.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Inhabitants of the World do daily increaſe, and their incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſurmounts daily their decreaſe; which could not be, unleſs the World of Mankind had their original within ſome proportionate time, and could not conſiſt with ſuch a vaſt exceſs of duration which ſome would aſſign, much leſs with an eternal duration, or ſuch as never had a beginning.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There hath in all Ages, and among all People been a conſtant tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition retained and believed, touching the Origination of Mankind <hi>ex non genitis vel per generationem propagatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the Heads of thoſe Evidences of Fact which I ſhall uſe in this Argument touching the Origination of Mankind, whereunto poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly other occaſional Topicks of the like nature may be added.</p>
               <p>And touching theſe Evidences of Fact, this I ſhall ſubjoyn.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That I do not lay the weight of this Argument upon thoſe Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Fact, becauſe they have or may have their ſeveral allays and fallibilities, which I ſhall impartially ſubjoyn to every particular To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick.</p>
               <p>But I lay the weight of the Argument upon what hath been before ſaid, which to me ſeems to be little leſs than demonſtrative, drawn from the intrinſick nature of the thing, and from that abſurdity which would ariſe upon the Suppoſition of the Eternity of Mankind, and the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of an eternal duration, <hi>à parte ante,</hi> to ſucceſſive Natures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That although ſingly and apart theſe Evidences of Fact are not ſo concluſive but have their allays and exceptions, yet they have theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that advance their evidence, as very credible; 1. In that the Suppoſition which they are produced to prove, is not impoſſible to be true: 2. That there is nothing of probability of Reaſon or Inſtance that can be produced againſt the truth of that Suppoſition which is contended to be proved by them: 3. They have ſo much the more weight and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in that they do ſuffragate and bear witneſs to the truth of that Suppoſition (namely, the Inception of Mankind) which holds ſo great a congruity with the intrinſick reaſon and nature of the thing, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof, namely, the Eternity of Mankind, is apparently contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to a ſtrict and true reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That although theſe Evidences of Fact, taken ſingly and apart, poſſibly may not be ſo weighty, yet the very concurrence and coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſo many Evidences that contribute to the Proof of the thing deſigned, carries with it a great weight, even as to the point of Fact: it is not probable that that Suppoſition ſhould be falſe which hath ſo many concurrent Teſtimonies bearing witneſs to it: And therefore although I ſhall impartially ſubjoyn thoſe Allays and Abatements which may be brought againſt the ſeveral Inſtances, whereby if ſingle, they might ſeem of leſs weight and moment; yet I do not thereby take off that Evidence
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64147:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which in conſort and conjunction they give to the truth of the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition intended to be proved by them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it cannot be expected in an Argument of this nature, which is touching a matter of Fact, that Evidences of Fact can be no more than topical and probable; and therefore though there may be Allays and Abatements that may take away a neceſſary or infallible concludency in theſe Evidences of Fact, yet it is ſufficient that they be probable and inductive of Credibility, though not of Science or Infallibility. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as I remember, in the beginning of his <hi>Politicks</hi> tells us that all Truths have not the ſame kind of Evidence, neither indeed can have, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is unreaſonable to expect ſuch an Evidence as the thing cannot poſſibly bear, though it be a real Truth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That among theſe Evidences of Fact, though all contribute to the Proof of the Suppoſition, yet the three laſt ſeem to be of that nature that they are of greateſt weight, and leſs ſubject to exception.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That in as much as in this Argument I deſign only the uſe of Reaſon and Reaſonable Evidence, and endeavour to make my Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition evident to Reaſonable Men as ſuch; I do not therefore make uſe of the divine and irrefragable Authority of the Holy Scriptures: For they that ſubſcribe to the Infallibility and Divine Authority of them, need none of this Method of Ratiocination that I uſe to prove this Suppoſition of the Origination of Mankind, which is ſo plainly and diſtinctly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Holy Scriptures; and therefore where I have recourſe to the Holy Scriptures, I uſe it but as a Moral Evidence, a Hiſtory highly credible; and I demand of my Reader<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this equal Juſtice, That he would at leaſt give it that credit that the Antiquity, Congruity, and Moral Evidence of it deſerves, which certainly would be much more than what the moſt do ordinarily allow to the Hiſtory of <hi>Thucydides, Herodotus, Livy, Tacitus, Manethon, Xenophon, Cteſias,</hi> or <hi>Beroſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Though in this large Diſcourſe I may ſeem to loſe time by proving of that which is not queſtioned by ſober Men, that in a laborious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this nature I do rather raiſe a Queſtion that would be at quiet if let alone, at leaſt I loſe time, and, <hi>magno conatu nihil efficiam;</hi> yet I hope in the Concluſion it will be of uſe to confirm our Faith, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the value of the Holy Scriptures, and to give ſome ſtop to thoſe <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> and <hi>Epicurean</hi> Opinions that begin more than formerly to obtain in the World.</p>

               <p>BUT before I begin, I ſhall prefix a ſhort Chronological Scheme of Times, to which I ſhall have occaſion oftentimes to refer; wherein I ſhall not be over-ſollicitous for great curioſity or exactneſs.

               <p>Having premiſed thus much touching the Chronological Account of ſome Times and Things paſt, without confining my ſelf to the exactneſs of Years, and with omiſſion of many things happening in theſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods; I ſhall now proceed with the firſt of my Inſtances, namely, touching the Hiſtories of former Ages, and their Antiquity; reſerving
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64147:72"/>
the matter of their Hiſtories, and what may be collected from them, to the enſuing Chapters.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Nations whoſe Hiſtorians put fair for the greateſt Antiquity, are the <hi>Romans, Grecians, Perſians, Aſſyrians</hi> or <hi>Babylonians, Egyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Jews:</hi> of all theſe there is ſomething extant.</p>
               <p>As touching the <hi>Chineſes</hi> and their long derived Annals, there is much ſpoken by report or relation, but nothing authentick thereof is extant to the common view but ſome ingenious yet uncertain Collections out of <hi>Martinius</hi> by Mr. <hi>Webb</hi> in his Eſſay touching the Primitive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; <hi>Voſſius,</hi> and ſome others: and therefore I ſhall ſpare any thing touching them.</p>
               <p>Firſt touching the <hi>Romans,</hi> though there were many Monuments of Antiquity preſerved in writing among them, as appears by their Laws of Twelve Tables, their <hi>Faſti Conſulares,</hi> the Tranſcripts whereof are extant to this day; yet we cannot expect ſo much Antiquity of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Writers among theſe, as we may among other People of greater Antiquity; ſince the firſt Foundation of their City was ſome time after the <hi>Olympiads</hi> began, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and about the year of the World 3190.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grecians,</hi> whoſe Monarchy preceded that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> have more ancient Hiſtorians than the <hi>Romans:</hi> And not to reckon up their Philoſophers and Poets, that applied not themſelves to Hiſtory, I ſhall only mention theſe that follow: <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that lived about the 97<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 98<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad; Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who lived about the 85<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 88<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad;</hi> but he among them of greateſt note and antiquity was <hi>Homer,</hi> who wrote the Hiſtory of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War; touching the time of his life and writing the Chronologiſts agree not, ſome making him 200 years after the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſome more, ſome leſs; but all placing him before the firſt <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and after the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> thoſe two famous <hi>Epochae</hi> among the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ancienteſt Poetical Hiſtorian that is extant among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> although it is not unlike that many were more ancient among them, as is mentioned by <hi>Tatianus</hi> in <hi>Euſeb. praeparationis lib.</hi> 10. as <hi>Linus</hi> the Tutor of <hi>Hercules, Amphion, Orpheus, Muſaeus,</hi> and ſome others; yet we have little extant of them but Poetical Raptures and Fictions, and thoſe alſo but in fragments and pieces traditionally preſerved in ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Authors.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> though their Monarchy were more ancient than that of <hi>Greece,</hi> yet we have leſs extant of Hiſtorical Writings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; the ancienteſt that I have heard of is that of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> though a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Cteſias,</hi> who is ſuppoſed to have lived contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with <hi>Xenophon; Megaſthenes,</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> Hiſtorian about the 120<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad,</hi> out of whom <hi>Abydenus</hi> that wrote touching the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> extracted many things relating to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> as appears by his Fragments cited by <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Praepar. ſect.</hi> 41.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Chaldean</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> Hiſtorians, though that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy be extended to a vaſt Period by ſome of their ancient Hiſtorians, yet the ancienteſt credible Hiſtorians that we have concerning them are, <hi>Beroſus</hi> who lived about the 130<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and <hi>Abydenus</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; only it is reported by <hi>Simplicius</hi> out of <hi>Porphyry,</hi> that <hi>Caliſthenes</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:64147:73"/>
one of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Captains brought to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> from <hi>Babylon</hi> a relation of their ancienteſt Aſtronomical Calculations, 1903 years before the Taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Alexander,</hi> which is ſuppoſed to be in the year of the World 3620 according to the <hi>Septuagint;</hi> which gives a probable conjecture of the Inception of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy to be about 200 years before the Birth of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> from whom it is ſuppoſed that not only Learning but Letters themſelves were brought into <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Cadmus;</hi> the firſt and ancienteſt Hiſtorian is ſuppoſed to be <hi>Sancuniathon,</hi> who is related by <hi>Philo Biblius</hi> according to <hi>Euſeb. praepar. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 9. to have been before the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and very near the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to have written a Hiſtory <hi>à prima Univerſi molitione,</hi> and that he ſearched many Monuments of Antiquity: The Writings of <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus</hi> whom the <hi>Egyptians</hi> call <hi>Thoth,</hi> and the <hi>arcana Ammoneorum volumina,</hi> purged the Hiſtory of former times from Fables, and gave a full account of former Ages, whoſe Writings <hi>Philo Biblius</hi> tranſlated into <hi>Greek,</hi> and digeſted into nine Volumes, he gathered much from <hi>Hierombal</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Jao,</hi> whom <hi>Bochart</hi> upon very probable reaſons ſuppoſeth to be <hi>Gedeon</hi> called <hi>Jerubbaal;</hi> and having ſet up an <hi>Ephod</hi> in his City, might be ſuppoſed a Prieſt, and from the intercourſe between them the Idol <hi>Baal-berith</hi> was brought from <hi>Berith</hi> the City of <hi>Sancunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,</hi> into <hi>Judea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they pretended to the greateſt antiquity both of Government and Learning; the latter they principally derived from <hi>Hermes,</hi> ſtiled by ſome <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus,</hi> and by the <hi>Egyptians Thoth;</hi> the <hi>Phenicians</hi> made claim to this man as theirs, attributed to him the Invention of Letters, of Navigation, of the Virtues of Herbs, <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Praeparat. ſect.</hi> 10. <hi>de Phoenicum Theologia;</hi> he is ſuppoſed more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient than <hi>Moſes,</hi> but we have nothing authentick exiſting which he wrote: The ancienteſt Hiſtorian of the Affairs of <hi>Egypt</hi> was <hi>Manethes</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſt, who lived about, or as ſome think, before the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> he carries up the <hi>Res Aegyptiacas</hi> to an exceſſive Antiquity, and yet with great particularity and pretended certainty: ſome account him fabulous, becauſe he carries up the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Dynaſties before the Flood, yea and long before the Creation; others aſſert the probability of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Dynaſties to over-reach the univerſal Flood, but ſalve that prodigious exceſs of their numerous Years by reducing them to Months, or <hi>Anni Lunares,</hi> which were anciently ſo accounted among the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> have had other Writers of their Hiſtories, but of a later date, as <hi>Ptolemeus Mendeſius,</hi> mentioned ſometimes by <hi>Euſebius;</hi> and thoſe <hi>Arabick</hi> Hiſtorians mentioned by <hi>Kircher</hi> in that Book that delivers the Hiſtory of the ſucceſſion of their Dynaſties.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I come to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtory begun by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and continued down in a clear ſucceſſion and <hi>ſeries</hi> of times till their return from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity and this Hiſtory hath a juſt prelation above all the Writings of other Hiſtorians in theſe enſuing reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It hath the greateſt and moſt particular certainty, and far beyond any of the Hiſtorians before mentioned; it contains the certain Periods of Times, Names, Men, Places, Actions, and all Circumſtances requirable
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64147:73"/>
in a Hiſtory to inform; it is not involved in Myſtical expreſſions or Mythologies, but is plain, familiar, and intelligible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath the greateſt evidence of Truth that can be expected by a reaſonable man, namely, Evidence from it ſelf, the particularity and circumſtances of the things it relates; Evidence from the ancienteſt Heathen Authors, eſpecially <hi>Sancuniathon, Beroſus,</hi> and <hi>Abydenus</hi> before mentioned; Evidence from the ſeveral parts thereof, the Book of one Age bearing witneſs to another; as the Books of <hi>Joſhua</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Books of <hi>Kings</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> though written in ſeveral Ages; <hi>Evidentia rei,</hi> or <hi>facti,</hi> there cannot be greater Evidence than the Regiment of a People for ſo many Ages according to the Laws given and recorded by their firſt Hiſtorian <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the enjoyment of their Poſſeſſions according to the diſtribution of their next Hiſtorian <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is no broken Piece, or Hiſtorical Fragment, but it is carried down from the beginning of Time to all the enſuing Ages of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, without any <hi>chaſma</hi> or interval.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It hath the evidence of the higheſt credibility that any thing of that nature is capable of, That the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> eſpecially, which are the <hi>Caput Hiſtoriae Judaicae,</hi> were written by that Man <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that he lived in that Age wherein he is ſuppoſed to write: 1. The conſtant uninterrupted Tradition of that Kingdom and Nation from it firſt coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, even to this day. 2. The atteſtation of all the ſucceding Writers of that Hiſtorical <hi>Series</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Affairs. 3. The inviolable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of thoſe Laws given by <hi>Moſes</hi> and recorded in that Hiſtory, as of the Laws given by him. 4. The Suffrage of all Heathen Authors both modern and ancient, that have occaſion to mention the concerns of that People.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a Hiſtory that contains matters of far greater moment and antiquity than any other Writers but ſuch as in probability made their Collections out of it, namely, of the Tranſactions from the firſt Creation of the World until the Univerſal Flood, and from thence to the time of him that firſt wrote it, namely <hi>Moſes.</hi>

It is a Hiſtory that was really written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was far more ancient than all the Heathen Writers above mentioned (excepting only <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> of whoſe Writings we have nothing extant) and more ancient than moſt of thoſe Things or Notes recorded by thoſe moſt ancient Heathen Writers which for the moſt part filled their Books; He wrote 540 years before <hi>Homer;</hi> 200 years before <hi>Sancuniathon,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Bochart</hi>'s account; 300 years before the Expedition of the <hi>Argonauts;</hi> 350 years before the <hi>Trojan</hi> War; and a conſiderable time before the <hi>Apotheoſes</hi> or Inaugurations of many of the Heatheniſh Deities. So that as the Matter of his Hiſtory, ſo the Time of his writing is far more ancient than the writing of the moſt ancient Heathen Hiſtorians that are at all extent. Much of this I ſhall have occaſion to reſume and enlarge in the enſuing Chapters, yet this was neceſſary in this place.</p>
               <p>The Inference that is made from hence is, That probably if the World of Mankind had been Eternal, or if it had any ſuch vaſt diſtance from its Beginning as ſome ſuppoſe, we ſhould have had Hiſtorical Monuments and Writings long before the Age of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:64147:74"/>But for all this, I muſt needs ſay, this Conſideration ſingly (I ſay ſingly) taken and weighed, maketh not much againſt an eternal or at leaſt a vaſter <hi>Epocha</hi> of the firſt Origination of Man than is ordinarily ſuppoſed; I ſhall therefore ſet down thoſe allays that make againſt the ſtrength of the conſequence drawn from this Topick.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is evident that the uſe of Letters and Writing were far more ancient than the time of <hi>Moſes;</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Phenicians</hi> carry up the original of the invention thereof to <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus,</hi> which is ſuppoſed long before <hi>Moſes:</hi> And although <hi>Cadmus</hi> is ſuppoſed to have brought the uſe of Letters out of <hi>Phoenicia</hi> into <hi>Greece</hi> ſome time after the Age of <hi>Moſes,</hi> according to <hi>Polydore Virgil, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. out of <hi>Pliny, Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> and others; yet it appears by what is before mentioned, that there were in <hi>Phoenicia</hi> very ancient written Volumes called <hi>Volumina Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeorum</hi> long before the time of <hi>Sancuniathon.</hi> And if we believe the Tradition of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the Pillars of <hi>Seth</hi> were extant in his time; and according to <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſome Fragments of the Writings of <hi>Enoch</hi> were traditionally extant in his time: But howſoever <hi>Moſes</hi> (if he be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Hiſtory of <hi>Job,</hi> whom ſome think to be contemporary at leaſt with <hi>Jacob</hi>) mentions Books and Writings to have been common things in the time of <hi>Job, Job</hi> 19.23. <hi>Joſephus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Tertull. de Habitu Mulierum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Surely if Writing were ſo ancient, it is probable that many Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories might be before the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> which were loſt in ſucceſſion of time, as it muſt be agreed that moſt of thoſe ancient Monuments that in the granted Period of the World were extant before <hi>Moſes</hi> time are ſince loſt, and many millions of Books that have been written ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> time have by the injury of Time and Men been loſt; much more thoſe Books which were written antecedent to <hi>Moſes</hi> time: And the truth is, the preſervation of the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> entire unto this day, when ſo many of a far later date are loſt, is to be attributed to the ſpecial Providence of Almighty God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, they that aſſign the ſhorteſt time between the Origination of Mankind and the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> allow it to be ſomewhat above 2460 years: So that although <hi>Moſes</hi> were admitted the firſt Hiſtorian that ever wrote, it would very near as ſtrongly conclude againſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of 2460 years before his writing as againſt an eternal exiſtence of Mankind: if it ſhould be an Argument againſt the latter, it would be ſuch alſo againſt the former.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſidering the many mutations and caſualties of Wars, Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrations, eſpecially that of the General Flood, there might probably be an obliteration of all thoſe Monuments of Antiquity that immenſe Ages precedent at ſome time have yielded. <hi>Cecrops</hi> was contemporary with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Belus</hi> and <hi>Ninus</hi> were before him; yet we have no Monuments extant of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſo ancient as <hi>Belus,</hi> or of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ſo ancient as <hi>Cecrops,</hi> but ſuch as are Traditions, and written long after their times. So that although I have mentioned this concerning the known Periods of Hiſtorical Writers, yet I think we are to be careful not to lay too great a ſtreſs ſingly on it, and it is the leaſt of all that follow in weight or evidence: And yet this was fit to be mentioned, becauſe it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the more clear diſcovery and application of that which follows.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. III.</hi> The ſecond Evidences of Fact, namely, the apparent Evidences of the firſt Foundation of the greatest and ancient Kingdoms and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires.</head>
               <p>I Come to my Second Evidence of Fact, which is the ſubject Matter of Hiſtories, and principally concerning the Evidence ariſing from them of the firſt Original of the moſt conſiderable Monarchies in the World.</p>
               <p>Touching the great Monarchies of the World, their Original is ſo well known, and delivered down to us from Authors of unqueſtionable truth, that there need little be ſaid touching them; for they have their confeſſed <hi>Epochae</hi> within certain and known Periods. As the beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy under <hi>Romulus,</hi> which gives the <hi>Epocha Urbis conditae</hi> in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad;</hi> the beginning of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, which hath its <hi>Epocha</hi> in <hi>Alexander</hi> about the 111<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad;</hi> the beginning of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, which had its <hi>Epocha</hi> in <hi>Cyrus</hi> about the 55<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad,</hi> though the ſame were not eſtabliſhed in the beginning of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but completed in <hi>Cambyſes</hi> his Son about the 62<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad.</hi> And the like might be obſerved concerning ſeveral ſmaller Kingdoms, whoſe originals are delivered over to us in Hiſtories.</p>
               <p>And although it is true that theſe Beginnings of theſe ſeveral Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies and Kingdoms do not ſo begin as if thoſe Men that founded theſe Monarchies were the natural Fathers of all thoſe Perſons that did <hi>coaleſcere in Regnum vel Monarchiam;</hi> or as if thoſe Monarchies were derived from the Heads or Roots that gave them this denomination, as all Men are derived from the common Parent of Mankind, or as poſſibly ſome other of the ancient Monarchies, which we ſhall have occaſion hereafter to mention, were derived: For many times the beginning of Monarchies and Kingdoms was by the coalition of many Perſons, it may be of ſeveral Nations, into an Army, as they did under <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or into a City, as they did under <hi>Romulus,</hi> or by tranſmigration of Perſons from one Countrey to another, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did.</p>
               <p>And therefore we are not to take it that theſe Originations of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies were the Origination of all the People that were joyned in it; for they had their exiſtence oftentimes before, and took their denomination from the <hi>Dux Exercitùs</hi> or the <hi>Rector Civitatis,</hi> under which they were as it were liſted in their Civil or Military coalition.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Argument is not thus neceſſarily that the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy or the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy had not its beginning before ſuch a time, therefore thoſe Men that were the conſtituent parts thereof had no exiſtence before that time; but that the Civil Society under the Prince, Rector or form of Government then began to be formally ſuch in ſuch a ſpecial Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>But thoſe Monarchies that pretend to the greateſt Antiquity are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,</p>

               <p>Theſe I ſhall examin in order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, we do with the beſt authority both of Sacred and Prophane Writers ſuppoſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it had its beginning ſince the Univerſal Deluge from <hi>Ham</hi> the youngeſt Son of <hi>Noah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Reaſons and Authorities againſt that Suppoſition are not of weight enough to evince the contrary.</p>
               <p>Before I come to my Reaſons for this Aſſertion, ſomething I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe touching the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire, and how it ſtood in relation to that of the <hi>Babylonian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems that <hi>Babylon</hi> was at firſt the Seat of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire, the building whereof ſome attribute to <hi>Belus,</hi> ſome to <hi>Ninus</hi> his Son, ſome to <hi>Semiramis</hi> his Wife, and ſome to others: but afterwards the <hi>Caput Imperti</hi> of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> was <hi>Ninive,</hi> built upon the River <hi>Tigris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It alſo ſeems, that in proceſs of time the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> either new built or repaired <hi>Babylon</hi> that had lain long neglected, and the ſame was peopled with thoſe People on the South of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> called <hi>Caldeans:</hi> That which gives me light of it, and indeed of the whole Hiſtory of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy is <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 23.13. <hi>Behold the land of the Caldeans, this people was not till the Aſſyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderneſs: They ſet up the towers thereof, they raiſed up the palaces thereof.</hi> It ſeems therefore that <hi>Babylon</hi> formerly neglected, by this favour of the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> proſpered into a petty Kingdom, and growing powerful did ſet up for themſelves in the time of <hi>Ahaz</hi> the King of <hi>Judah</hi> who was contemporary with <hi>Tiglah Pileſer,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.10. And poſſibly the firſt divided King of <hi>Babylon</hi> was that <hi>Nabonaſſar</hi> that gave the original of the <hi>Aera Nabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſaris</hi> that began about the beginning of King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> in the beginning of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad,</hi> about four years after the Building of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems that either the ſame <hi>Tiglah Pileſer,</hi> or his next Succeſſor <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſar</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> that carried away the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the ninth year of <hi>Hoſeah,</hi> about four years after the death of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.6. did afterwards re-take <hi>Babylon;</hi> for certainly he was poſſeſſed of it at or ſhortly after the deportation of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for he brought Men from <hi>Babylon,</hi> from <hi>Cutha,</hi> from <hi>Ava, Hamath</hi> and <hi>Sepharvaim,</hi> to put into <hi>Samaria.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.24.</p>
               <p>It ſeems that moſt of theſe places from whence People were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted to <hi>Samaria,</hi> were places conquered by the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarch, who did as Victors uſe prudently to do, tranſplant the conquered into other places; and the ſame ſeems evident for ſome of theſe places at leaſt, and as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably for <hi>Babylon</hi> alſo, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.24. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 10.10. particularly for <hi>Hamath, Sepharvaim</hi> and <hi>Avah:</hi> And accordingly he tranſplanted the conquered People into <hi>Gozan</hi> and other places, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.11. which were won by <hi>Salmanaſſar</hi> from the <hi>Medes</hi> by Conqueſt. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Senacherib</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Salmanaſſar,</hi> and came up againſt <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the fourteenth year of his Reign, where he received that great blow of 185000
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64147:75"/>
Men, which ſent him back to <hi>Nineveh</hi> where he was ſlain; and <hi>Ezar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haddon</hi> his Son reigned in his ſtead. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.35, 36, 37.</p>
               <p>This gave opportunity to the new uſurped Kingdom of <hi>Babylon</hi> again to break the Yoak of <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy; for it evidently appears that <hi>Berodach-Baladan</hi> the Son of <hi>Baladan</hi> was King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſent to complement <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when there was another King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.12. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> having reigned 29 years dyed, and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> his Son ſucceeded him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> reigned 55 years, and towards the latter end of his Reign he was carried Captive to <hi>Babylon</hi> by the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.11. whether the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> had regained <hi>Babylon,</hi> or whether the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> had overcome the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and ſo held the ſtile of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, appears not, though the latter ſeems probable by comparing the reprehenſion of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ammon</hi> ſucceeded, and reigned 2 years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſucceeded, and reigned 31 years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> 3 months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jehoiachim</hi> 11 years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jehoiachin</hi> 3 months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zedekiah</hi> 11 years; the laſt year of whoſe Reign was contemporary with the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now putting all the years together from the firſt of <hi>Ahaz</hi> to the laſt of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> are about 155 years and 6 months; out of which ſubducting 19 years for the Reign of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> there remains from the firſt of <hi>Ahaz</hi> to the firſt of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> 136 years, which comes very near to the <hi>Aera Nabonaſſaris;</hi> for according to the common Calculation the firſt of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> hapned in the 138<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Nabonaſſar,</hi> which began about two years before the firſt year of <hi>Ahaz;</hi> or in the ſecond year of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that in all probability, <hi>Baladan</hi> who was the Father of <hi>Merodach-Baladan</hi> that ſent to viſit <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> might be that <hi>Nabonaſſar</hi> whoſe <hi>Aera</hi> is ſo much celebrated.</p>
               <p>After the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the entire <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy was tranſlated to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the King thereof. <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his Firſt Book tells us that <hi>Cyaxares</hi> the Grand-child of <hi>Dioces</hi> firſt attempted the taking of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> but was repulſed by the aid of the <hi>Scythians;</hi> and that afterwards he took it, and became Maſter of all <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria, Excepta Babylonica quadam portione.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But according to the Hiſtories of <hi>Tobit</hi> and <hi>Judith, Niniveh</hi> was taken by <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and afterwards entirely poſſeſſed by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar, Tobit</hi> 10.17. <hi>Judith</hi> 11. But this is obſcure, becauſe it hath been conceived that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a common Name uſed amongſt the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kings, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> among the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> only it may not be impoſſible that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> who was certainly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with <hi>Cyaxares</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> might be an aſſiſtant in the Deſtruction of <hi>Niniveh</hi> with <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> called it may be by <hi>Tobit, Aſſuerus;</hi> but how he came to be ſole Poſſeſſor after in the time of <hi>Judith,</hi> is hard to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> made <hi>Babylon</hi> the Seat of his Empire, and ſo far enlarged it that it ſeemed as new built, as his own arrogant and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64147:76"/>
vain-glorious expreſſion witneſſeth; <hi>Is not this great Babel that I have built?</hi> Dan. 4.30.</p>
               <p>Upon all this that hath been ſaid, it ſeems plain:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Babylon</hi> or <hi>Babel</hi> was the firſt or ancient Seat of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ſame was firſt built by <hi>Belus,</hi> or <hi>Ninus,</hi> or <hi>Semiramis,</hi> as the Heathen Writers tell us; or by <hi>Nimrod,</hi> as the Holy Hiſtory tells us, who poſſibly might be the ſame with <hi>Belus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That afterward the Seat of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire was tranſlated to <hi>Nineveh</hi> the great City of that Empire.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That afterward <hi>Babylon</hi> was again either repaired or enlarged by the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire, and was the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of that part of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> called <hi>Caldaea,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof were greatly addicted to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Obſervation, and became ſo famous for it, that a <hi>Caldean</hi> and an Aſtrologer were terms equivalent in common appellation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That afterward the <hi>Babylonians</hi> or <hi>Caldeans</hi> obtained or uſurped a divided Kingdom from the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the firſt King of that divided Kingdom was called <hi>Nabonaſſar,</hi> which give the original to the <hi>Aera Nabonaſſaris,</hi> beginning about the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. That about 140 years after the beginning of that Kingdom it grew ſo potent, that it acquired the whole <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy, and became the Seat thereof under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. That <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> again enlarged the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> with Buildings and Walls of incredible ſtrength and glory.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, I now come to thoſe Reaſons that ſatisfie me that the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy was not of that great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and the favourers of their Tradition pretended, but had its known Original or <hi>Epocha</hi> from whence it began.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Authority of the Heathen Authors allow not above 1400 years at moſt for the continuance of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy, and lodge the Original of it in <hi>Belus</hi> the Father of <hi>Ninus,</hi> the beginning of whoſe Reign is by computation to be caſt in the 153<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year after the Flood, according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Account. <hi>Vide probationes indè Petavii doctrina temp. l.</hi> 9. <hi>per totum.</hi> The Account, according to <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> runs thus; The <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> Monarchy beginning with <hi>Ninus</hi> laſted 1360 years unto the fall of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> by <hi>Arbaces</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> after which that Monarchy fell in with the <hi>Mede:</hi> it continued there until <hi>Pul</hi> became the Head of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy, and after him <hi>Tiglah Pileſer,</hi> and then <hi>Salmanaſſar,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Senacherib:</hi> The Proof they add to this Supputation is this; That from the Fall of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> to the Taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Alexander</hi> are accounted 543 years, which added to the former number gives 1903 years, the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Caldean</hi> Aſtrological Calculation brought by <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> at the Taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Alexander;</hi> which caſts the Beginning of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy under <hi>Belus,</hi> or at leaſt under <hi>Ninus</hi> his Son, to be about the year of the World 1717, about 60 years after the Flood, according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Account; though others, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing alſo the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Account, caſt the ſame to be about 104 years after the Flood.</p>

tell us of ſeven Kings of the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> and ſix Kings of the <hi>Arabians</hi> that were antecedent to <hi>Belus</hi> in that Empire, that ſucceſſively reigned in <hi>Babylon</hi> 440 years; that <hi>Belus</hi> obtained by Conqueſt the Kingdom, and reigned 55 years; and by this Account the Beginning of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Kingdom under <hi>Ninus</hi> was 631 years after the Flood, and one Age after the Confuſion of Languages in the time of <hi>Phaleg:</hi> But which way ſoever we take, yet we find a Beginning of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire, though they that ſuppoſe it 440 years before <hi>Belus,</hi> thruſt the Deluge and the Creation farther back than the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Account.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Authority of the Holy Scripture by the Pen of <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us the Original of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy in <hi>Nimrod,</hi> which poſſibly may be the Name in <hi>Hebrew</hi> of <hi>Belus</hi> the firſt Founder of it. And here I do not take advantage of the Divine Authority of the Sacred Scripture, but make uſe of it only as a Hiſtory, and ſingly upon that account hath greater evidence of its truth than any Heathen Hiſtorian whatſoever. 1. The Writer thereof was moſt certainly nearer the times of the firſt Foundation, of that Monarchy by above 800 years than any other Hiſtorian that gives us the account of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy; which is a great advantage in point of evidence touching the truth of any Hiſtorical Relation. Again, 2. He was not very far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Place or Seat of that Monarchy, the Wilderneſs and <hi>Paleſtine</hi> being not far diſtant from <hi>Aſſyria</hi> 3. He was deſcended from him that was the native of that Country, namely <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was born and lived many years in the <hi>Caldean</hi> Country, and doubtleſs did bring along with him and tranſmit to his Poſterity a fair Tradition of that Empire, being contemporary with <hi>Peleg,</hi> in whoſe time the famous diſſipation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and diſtinction of Languages hapned. 4. He was educated in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the people whereof were greatly learned, eſpecially in Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Computations. 5. The coherence and ſynchroniſm of all the parts of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Chronology, eſpecially after the Flood, bears a moſt ſingular teſtimony to the truth of his Hiſtory and Computation: for although he draws not down the lineal Deſcendents of <hi>Ham</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> down to his time, but only mentions their Children and Grand-children for two or three Generations at moſt; yet he draws down the lineal Pedigree from <hi>Sem</hi> in the Sacred Line down to his very Age, together with their Births and Ages, which are a great evidence of the probability of the reſt of his Account. So that if we take the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon a bare Moral account, abſtracted from the Authority of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, he hath greater evidence of the truth of what he relates than any Hiſtorian whatſoever that takes upon him the narrative of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Kingdoms or Empires, the ancienteſt of which Hiſtorians were above 1000 years later than <hi>Moſes.</hi> But this I ſhall have occaſion farther to improve hereafter.</p>
               <p>The Objections againſt this late Original of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy (for it had its ſucceſſive tranſlation into theſe denominations) are principally theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it appears by the Account of ancient Hiſtorians, that the <hi>Caldeans</hi> (in whom the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy began and ended) at the Taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Alexander</hi> had preſerved Aſtronomical Calculations for about 400000 years; thus <hi>Diodorus Siculus, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Quadringenta
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64147:77"/>
tria annorum millia uſque ad aſcenſum Alexandri numerant;</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> in his ſecond Book <hi>de Divinatione</hi> mentions the number to be greater, <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringenta &amp; ſeptuaginta millia annorum, in periclitandis experiendiſque Pueris quicunque eſſent nati, Babylonios poſuiſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That it ſeems impoſſible, that if their Monarchy began but in <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> or ſo ſhort a time after the Univerſal Deluge, that in the time of <hi>Ninus,</hi> by ſome ſuppoſed the firſt, by ſome the ſecond King of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians</hi> or <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the Empire could have grown ſo populous as to build that vaſt City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> whoſe ſtate and magnificence and amplitude were of incredible greatneſs; or that his Widow <hi>Semiramis</hi> could at once bring into the field againſt <hi>Zoroaſtres</hi> an Army of 1700000 Foot-men, 500000 Horſe-men, 100000 Chariots, 2000 Ships, as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> out of <hi>Cteſias, l.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. And therefore as well Mankind as the Empire of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> muſt have had a longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance to have ſet out ſuch an Army, than the ſucceſſion of an Empire for two or three Governours at moſt, or the ſucceſſions or propagations of Mankind within ſo ſhort a time as this is ſuppoſed to ſucceed the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Deluge, could afford. To the firſt I anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſome will have theſe Years to be but Months, which they ſuppoſe to be accounted Years by the ancient <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians:</hi> But as we have no certain evidence that they uſed to account a Month a Year, but if we had, yet that reduction will not ſerve; for that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Lunar Months reduced to Solar Years will ariſe to above 40000 Years, which will over-reach the Creation of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore we may with the ſame <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> pronounce it to be an incredible and fabulous Account warranted by no credible evidence, but meerly their own fancy or impoſture; that becauſe they held the World eternal, would gratifie their people with a ſucceſſion of an incredible Antiquity. And it appears to be fabulous, 1. For that in all this time they would probably have gotten the perfect Theory of the Planetary Motions and Poſitions, which it is plain they did not, if we believe the ſame Author; for they were at a loſs touching the true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries and periods of the Eclipſes, eſpecially of the <hi>Sun.</hi> 2. For that <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> who was very curious in ſearching the famous Periods of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> or <hi>Caldean</hi> Celeſtial Obſervations, at the very time when they pretended ſo great an Antiquity, namely, at the Taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Alexander,</hi> upon a ſtrict enquiry found their Aſtronomical Obſervations not to be above 1903 years old, which he accordingly reported to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that employed him ſpecially in that Enquiry, as <hi>Simplicius</hi> reports in his Commentaries upon the Book of <hi>Ariſtotle de Caelo.</hi> The prodigious Accounts therefore of the <hi>Caldeans</hi> of the Times paſt deſerve as little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit as their Predictions of things to come, who, as the ſame <hi>Tully</hi> there obſerves, flattered both <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> with long Lives and happy and peaceable Death; both which fell out in the ſucceſs, to both extremely contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I come to the ſecond Objection, namely, That it ſeems altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the General Flood ſhould put a period to all former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and indeed to the whole Race of Mankind except eight perſons, and yet that from theſe in ſo ſhort a time ſuch vaſt and powerful Monarchies, eſpecially as that of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> or <hi>Syrian</hi> ſhould ariſe. To which I anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:64147:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. That if we ſhould admit the Computation of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> now much magnified by <hi>Voſſius</hi> and others, it would eaſily deliver us from that difficulty; for whereas the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Computation gives the Univerſal Flood to be but 1656 years after the Creation of Mankind, the <hi>Septuagint</hi> gives it to be 2262 years: and whereas the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Account gives us about 300 years from the Flood to the Birth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and conſequently about 104, and according to ſome only 58 years from the Flood to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Ninus</hi> the Son of <hi>Belus,</hi> the <hi>Septuagint</hi> gives us from the Flood to the Birth of <hi>Abraham</hi> 1132 years; and conſequently the beginning of <hi>Ninus</hi> though admitted to have been about 250 years before the Birth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> would yet have hapned near 800 years after the Flood, which would not only give a competent time for Mankind to grow to that great multitude that is ſuppoſed, but would ſatisfie thoſe preceding thirteen Kings in <hi>Babylon</hi> that are ſuppoſed to have worn out 440 years before <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the beginning of <hi>Belus</hi> the Father of <hi>Ninus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But the Objection needs not that help, neither doth enforce us to deſert the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Account to ſatisfie that or the like Objections. For conſidering the long Life of the Ancients that lived within 300 years after the Flood, and conſequently their coexiſtence with thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from them; we may without the help of a miraculous fertility find that in 104 years Mankind deſcended from <hi>Noah</hi> and his three Sons and their Wives, might ariſe to a ſtupendious multitude by that Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Progreſſion that would be found in their Generations. I ſhall not need to ſet down the proceſs of the Computation or the product, it is excellently done to my hand by <hi>Temporarius</hi> in his ſecond Book <hi>Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicarum demonſtrationum,</hi> and out of him by <hi>Petavius</hi> his <hi>Doctrina tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, lib.</hi> 10. and out of both by <hi>Kircherus</hi> in the firſt Book of his firſt Tome of his <hi>Oedipus Aegyptiacus,</hi> where he undertakes, that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of 200 years after the Flood the multitude of the coexiſting People might be ſo great, that if they were caſt into a ſquare <hi>Battalia,</hi> allowing to every perſon but one ſquare foot of ground, the ſide of that Square would be 372 Aſtronomical miles, or 25 Heavenly degrees. And thus far touching the Original of the <hi>Aſſyrian, Caldean,</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Touching the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they maintained the Origination of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and that the ſame was not Eternal, as it ſeems by <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in his ſecond Book; for they ſuppoſed, in reſpect of the fruitfulneſs of their ſoil and the convenience of their ſituation, that the firſt Original of Mankind was among them, and that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt People in the World.</p>
               <p>But though they admitted the Origination of Man, yet they pretended to a very great antiquity of their Nation and Government; and becauſe they would exceed all others, they ſuppoſe their firſt Governours were Gods: <hi>Diodorus</hi> tells us, that in the 180<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad</hi> they pretended a ſucceſſion of Government of 33000 years, whereof the firſt 18000 years they were governed by Gods and Heroes, and the laſt 15000 years by Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manetho,</hi> that wrote the Hiſtory of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> about the beginning of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy under <hi>Alexander,</hi> with very great pretence hath carried up their Government to an incredible diſtance before the Creation
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64147:78"/>
of Mankind; for he digeſted the ſucceſſive Governments of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> into 32 Dynaſties, and to each Dynaſty a great number of Governours and Years, whereof 15 exceeded the time of the Flood, and therefore are omitted by <hi>Africanus</hi> and others that yet are fond of the credit of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netho:</hi> the other 17 Dynaſties are ſuppoſed to be extended unto the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire for about 1694 years after the Flood.</p>
               <p>But 1. This Account, even of <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> is very uncertain; for it appears by <hi>Cenſorinus, de die Natali, cap.</hi> 19. that the ancient <hi>Egyptian</hi> year was <hi>bimeſtris,</hi> and after that <hi>trimeſtris,</hi> and after that, in latter time, of 13 months and 5 days: And ſome tell us, that yet their moſt ancient year was but one month, namely, one revolution of the <hi>Moon</hi> through the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> which if it ſhould be admitted, may ſhorten their Account of 33000 years to 3600 years or thereabout. But yet this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſerves not, for in all probability their years continued to be 365 days ever ſince the time of the <hi>Jewiſh Exody</hi> at leaſt, which will carry up the Account far beyond the Creation of Man, though their former years ſhould be ſuppoſed <hi>menſtrui</hi> or <hi>bimeſtres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it ſeems either a plain Impoſture of <hi>Manetho,</hi> out of an emulation of the pretended Antiquity of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, or at leaſt a very plain miſtake, by reckoning all theſe 32 Dynaſties or <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipatus ſucceſſivè,</hi> when it ſeems they were all contemporary, and that after <hi>Mene,</hi> which is ſuppoſed the firſt Head of theſe Dynaſties, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of <hi>Egypt</hi> was divided into ſeveral Principalities, and each had his Dynaſty, but the particular Regiment of each ſeveral Principality, <hi>Mene</hi> being the Head to them all; which is ſo well evinced by <hi>Voſſius</hi> in his little Tract <hi>de Aetate Mundi,</hi> out of <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> contemporary with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netho, Herodotus</hi> and others, that nothing can be added to it, or reaſonably objected againſt it; though <hi>Kircherus</hi> in the firſt Book of his <hi>Egyptian</hi> Antiquities endeavours to carry on the 17 laſt Dynaſties in continued ſucceſſion from <hi>Cham</hi> to the diſſolution of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monarchy by <hi>Alexander;</hi> and ſuppoſeth the firſt 15 Dynaſties to have incurred before the Flood, and the traditional memory thereof derived down by <hi>Cham</hi> to his Poſterity. But of this alſo more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Grecians,</hi> it is true, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy had its known <hi>Epocha</hi> in <hi>Alexander</hi> about the 114<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad:</hi> but they were a People long before, though divided into ſmaller Kingdoms or States; but the Memorials of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> were far more ancient than thoſe of <hi>Greece,</hi> which derived much of its Learning from the <hi>Egyptians. Cenſorinus</hi> in his golden Book <hi>de die Natali</hi> gives us out of <hi>Varro</hi> a threefold Period of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Hiſtories or Monuments or Times, <hi>Cap.</hi> 21. namely, 1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <hi>incognitum,</hi> from the firſt Origination of Mankind (if it had an Original) <hi>ad cataclyſmum priorem,</hi> or the <hi>Ogygian</hi> Flood: 2. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64147:78"/>
enquiry into the number, or the different Account of Chronologers touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: But within the compaſs of this <hi>tempus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Periodus fabuloſa,</hi> hapned many of thoſe Relations of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> namely, the Age of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> the Flood of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> ſhortly after the beginning of the Dynaſty of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in the time of <hi>Cretopus</hi> King of the <hi>Argives; Incendium Idae, Cadmus</hi> and <hi>Europa, Ganymedis raptus, Phaetontis incendium, Hercules Amphitryonis filius, Expeditio Argonautarum, Bellum Trojanum &amp; Reditus Heraclidarum, Ionica migratio,</hi> and many other fine Stories that have furniſhed ſome of the Poetical Hiſtorians of after Ages.</p>
               <p>But however <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> makes his Computation, <hi>Inachus,</hi> who was the firſt King of the <hi>Argives,</hi> though he were about 375 years after the beginning of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy, and contemporary with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> yet he began his Reign about 100 years before the <hi>Ogygian</hi> Flood, which hapned in the latter end of <hi>Phoroneus</hi> the Son of <hi>Inachus</hi> and ſecond King of the <hi>Argives.</hi> So that <hi>Inachus</hi> was about 100 years before the <hi>Ogygian</hi> Flood, and about 1070 or 1080 years before the firſt <hi>Olympiad</hi> upon this account.</p>
               <p>This then being, as it ſeems, the ſtate of theſe Periods, there ſeem two Nations of the <hi>Grecians</hi> that pretend to greateſt Antiquity, namely, the <hi>Argivi</hi> and the <hi>Attici.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former had their beginning with <hi>Inachus,</hi> whether before or after the <hi>Ogygian</hi> Flood it will not be much of moment, but at leaſt within 1070 years before the firſt <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which is the higheſt time that the <hi>Grecians</hi> pretend unto.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Attici,</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> Memorials give us no higher Account than of <hi>Ogyges,</hi> in whoſe time it is ſuppoſed the <hi>Ogygian</hi> Flood hapned in that part of <hi>Greece</hi> called <hi>Attica,</hi> and takes its name from him, namely, <hi>Diluvium Ogygium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of this Kingdom aroſe the Dynaſty of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> about 200 years after the <hi>Ogygian</hi> Flood, wherein <hi>Cecrops</hi> was the firſt Governour contemporary with <hi>Moſes;</hi> he firſt ſet up the Worſhip of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as ſome report. And ſo we have the Original of the Government of the <hi>Argives</hi> in <hi>Inachus,</hi> of the <hi>Athenians</hi> in <hi>Cecrops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſt under the name of <hi>Timaeus</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> tells us a large Story of the Iſland of <hi>Atlantis</hi> far bigger than <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that although now that goodly Iſland be loſt and ſwallowed up in the Sea, yet the <hi>Athenians</hi> were a kind of Colony tranſplanted from that Iſland into <hi>Greece</hi> about 7000 years before <hi>Solon</hi>'s time. But this is one of thoſe Poetical Fictions wherewith <hi>Plato</hi> plays, mingling more ſerious things with it in the following part of his Diſcourſe; and the Story hath no footſteps of any evidence for it, unleſs we ſhall ſuppoſe that <hi>Atlantis</hi> to be an Iſland that was before the Univerſal Deluge, and deſtroyed by it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Concerning the <hi>Seres</hi> or <hi>Chineſes,</hi> a People whoſe Cuſtoms and Hiſtories were ſtrangers to <hi>Europe</hi> till of late times, wherein ſome Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers have lately given us ſome account of thoſe great Periods both of their Hiſtories and Government. <hi>Voſſius</hi> in that little Book <hi>de Aetate Mundi,</hi> tells us by relation from others, That by their Hiſtories and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents their Empire hath laſted 4505 years in the year of Chriſt 1658, which reacheth ſome Ages beyond the Flood according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Account, but according to the <hi>Septuagint</hi> the beginning thereof falls in the time of <hi>Phaleg,</hi> 531 years after the Flood; which he brings as an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64147:79"/>
Argument for the Authority of the <hi>Septuagint:</hi> But the truth is, we are ſtill ſtrangers to the true ſtate of Chronology of the <hi>Seres</hi> or <hi>Chineſes,</hi> what we have touching it, is by broken relation of ſome few Travellers, and what they had, poſſibly may be gathered up from the vulgar Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of that People, upon which little of ſound concluſion can be made touching their Antiquity. But be it true or not, which we have from theſe Relations, yet their longeſt Period gives them a Beginning, and reacheth not ſo high as the pretended <hi>Epoch</hi> of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> or <hi>Egyptians,</hi> much leſs is there any thing in them that gives any colour of Evidence of an Eternal Duration.</p>
               <p>And thus I have gone through the Examination of thoſe Kingdoms and Monarchies which pretend to greateſt Antiquity, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and the <hi>Seres</hi> or <hi>Chineſes;</hi> upon all which we may obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though many of them pretend to a very great Antiquity, yet there are none that give us any ſufficient Evidence of an Eternal Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for what are thoſe Periods of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> or <hi>Babylonians</hi> to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Nay many of theſe Nations that pretend to the longeſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> yet diſclaim an Eternal Succeſſion; pretend themſelves to be <hi>Aborigines,</hi> and to be the firſt People, but yet not to be Eternal. Indeed their vaſt continuance, if admitted, would ſeem to contradict the Authenticalneſs and Authority of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Hiſtory, which contains a Relation of the Beginnings of Mankind within the compaſs of about 5660 Years, according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Account, and about 7240 Years, according to the <hi>Septuagint;</hi> but doth not ſo much as ſuppoſe an Eternity thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That notwithſtanding theſe great pretenſions of Antiquity, yet upon a true examination their great pretended Antiquity is fabulous; and the Origination of their Monarchies began ſome Ages after the general Deluge; and ſo the truth of the Holy Hiſtory concerning the Inception of Mankind, and the Inception of all the Monarchies in the World after the Deluge that happened under <hi>Noah,</hi> 1656 Years after the Creation of Mankind, is not at all weakened by thoſe Fabulous Antiquities of the <hi>Babylonians, Egyptians,</hi> or <hi>Grecians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That this Inception of the Notable Empires and Kingdoms of the World, even of thoſe that pretend greateſt Antiquity, and the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the uttermoſt Extent of the Hiſtories of the <hi>Babylonians, Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> within the compaſs of the Extent of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Monarchies, is an Evidence againſt the Eternity of Mankind; for had Mankind been Eternal, they had infinite Ages ſince arrived to all the perfection of Political Government, and to all thoſe Means and Arts for the preſerving the Memorials of things paſt, as they have now attained unto; there would have been no <hi>tempus</hi>

               <p>But yet this Conſideration touching the Antiquity of Monarchies, their Inception, and the Narratives and Hiſtorical Monuments of things, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening within the Periods of their Commencement and Continuances, are not of that weight that we can lay the ſtreſs of this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Inception of Mankind upon: And therefore this Conſideration muſt be taken with its allay, I ſhall therefore fully ſet down thoſe Inſtances that do give this Conſideration its due abatement.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no Conſequence, That becauſe a Monarchy or Kingdom had its Beginning, that therefore the People that conſtituted the <hi>Moles</hi> of that Kingdom had its Beginning: Kingdoms, Monarchies, and States, often change their Governours, and the Forms of Government, and their Stiles and Denominations, as the Silk-worm doth his ſhape, and yet the People in a continued ſucceſſion the ſame. <hi>Rome</hi> took its Name from <hi>Romulus,</hi> but the People were a <hi>Farrago,</hi> collected and gathered out of the neighbouring Nations. <hi>Greece</hi> fell into one Monarchy under <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> yet the People (that were the Stuffing, as it were, and Materials of that Monarchy) were exiſting before in other Forms of Government, and under other Governours. And though it is by ſome ſuppoſed, That the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy began in <hi>Ninus,</hi> yet <hi>Diodorus</hi> out of <hi>Cteſias</hi> tells us, That he made up that great Structure of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy by the Conqueſt of divers People, who thereby were added to it, as the <hi>Egyptians, Phenicians, Syria, Coelicia, Pamphilia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia, Myſia,</hi> and many more, mentioned by him, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England</hi> began not to be a People, when <hi>Alfred</hi> reduced it into a Monarchy, for the Materials thereof were extant before, namely, under the Heptarchy. So that the finding out of the Head of a Monarchy is not like the finding out the Head of a River in the Fountain, or the Head of a Family in one common Parent: The ancienteſt Monarchy might have a Beginning, and yet the People, that are the material conſtituent of it, might exiſt long before, under other Forms or Viciſſitudes of Governments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All Nations do not always begin their Hiſtories, or the Matter, of the ſame Antiquity with the People touching which they write; but ſome earlier, ſome later, according to the variety of their Opportunities, Educations, and Diſciplines.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were certainly the moſt knowing People of the World, began early to record the Memorials of their own Times, and of thoſe that anteceded them, delivered down by Tradition from the Patriarchs: Thus did <hi>Moſes;</hi> and the Annals of that People are carried down to the very diſſolution of their Government. The <hi>Phenicians</hi> began their Hiſtorical Monuments after them, the <hi>Grecians</hi> after them. The <hi>Pelaſgi</hi> and <hi>Attici</hi> were
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64147:80"/>
a People long before <hi>Homer</hi> wrote. <hi>England</hi> was doubtleſs Inhabited before <hi>Caeſar</hi> came over, yet we have few Monuments of <hi>Britain</hi> more ancient than <hi>Caeſar</hi> gives us; and from him, except <hi>Beda,</hi> we have few Authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtories by any known Hiſtorian before the Conqueſt by King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam;</hi> but they have been all written ſince, or very near his time; and many of the things which they have put together touching the <hi>Britains, Picts, Danes,</hi> yea and the beginning of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> have been collected out of broken Monuments in Monaſteries, and Tradition, and digeſted into <hi>ſeries</hi> and order of times by thoſe that have written long ſince the things done; by men that lived ſince the <hi>Normans</hi> came in, as <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington, William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury, Roger Hoveden, Matthew Paris,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third difficulty is this: That in thoſe elder times there were not thoſe means of preſerving the Monuments of things paſt, as after times afforded; for whatever antiquity the World may be ſuppoſed to be, it is plain that Arts have increaſed and grown: Printing is a new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and although Letters and Writing were ancient among the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> and from them derived to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet we muſt ſuppoſe they were not ſo perfect or ſo common in the elder Ages as in thoſe that ſucceed them. And therefore thoſe that contend for an Eternal ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Men in the World, do ſuppoſe that by a kind of circulation or rotation Arts have their ſucceſſive invention and perfection and tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from one People to another; and conſequently though ſome might be early able to deliver over Hiſtorical paſſages, as being better inſtructed in Letters and Writing, and more civilized than others, yet others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it later: As the <hi>Europeans</hi> had their Learning from the <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> ſo the <hi>Americans</hi> have it from the <hi>Europeans,</hi> and yet the People of <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>America</hi> may be of equal Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, there have been many viciſſitudes and changes whereby ancient Monuments and Hiſtories have been loſt: As 1. The Variation of Languages, or at leaſt of the Characters wherein they were written, many things written in former Ages being ſcarce legible in after Ages, and ſo neglected. 2. Wars and Deſolations hapning thereby, which obliterate many ancient Monuments. If by a kind of common ſtipulation or pact as it were, Monaſteries had not had a kind of common Protection in the viciſſitudes of the Conqueſts of <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Picts, Danes, Saxons</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> we had had very little extant of ancient things. 3. Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrations of People from one Country to another, whereby they left their ancient Monuments behind them, which were neglected by them that ſucceeded them. 4. Floods and Inundations, eſpecially in the parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which ſwept away many ancient Monuments.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Allays that are to be given to this particular touching the <hi>Epochae</hi> and Original of Monarchies, Kingdoms, and States, and the Monuments and Hiſtorical Relations of them or hapning in them, and to the weight of thoſe conſequences deduced or deducible from them, in order to the Argument in queſtion touching the Origination of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. IV.</hi> The Third Instance of Fact proving the Origination of Mankind, namely, the Invention of Arts.</head>
               <p>I Come to the Third Inſtance of Fact, namely, the Diſcovery and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of Arts, and the new Diſcoveries that later Ages have made of things that were not formerly known.</p>
               <p>And this Topick conſiſts principally of theſe parts; 1. That there have been ſuch Diſcoveries of Things and Arts not formerly known: 2. That conſequently the World, eſpecially of Mankind, is of a far later Edition than Eternity.</p>
               <p>Touching the former of theſe, it is very evident both by the Tradition of the Ancients, and alſo by our own unqueſtionable Experience, that very great Diſcoveries have been in ſeveral Ages made of Things and Arts that were hidden and unknown unto precedent Ages. I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with thoſe large Catalogues of profitable Inventions which have been ſucceſſively diſcovered, when before they were not known, at leaſt for ought appears to us; as the uſe of Husbandry, the making of Wine and Oyl, the diſcovery of the Letters of the Alphabet in ſucceſſive Ages, Muſick, Military and Civil Diſcipline, Engins of War, and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: Theſe and infinite more have been by the Induſtry of former Writers reduced to their ſeveral <hi>Epochae</hi> and Authors of their Diſcoveries, and ſome of the Authors have had therefore divine Honour given to them by the admiring Heathen. Theſe ſeveral Inventors and Inventions are regiſtred by <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in his firſt ſix Books, by <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> in the firſt Book of his <hi>Stromata,</hi> by <hi>Pliny l.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 56. and <hi>ex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſo</hi> by <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> in his eight Books <hi>de Rerum Inventoribus:</hi> In which and other Collections of that kind, although poſſibly there be many things that are fabulous, or grounded upon a very light and uncertain tradition; yet there are many things that are true or very credible, eſpecially ſince the Monuments of ancient times give us an account of the moſt remote Ages of Men; <hi>Rudes primùm &amp; incuria ſilveſtri non multùm à ferarum aſperitate diſſimiles, Macrob. in ſomnio Scipionis, l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. ſee the elegant deſcription of the elder Inhabitants of the World, <hi>Lucret. l.</hi> 5.
<q>
                     <l>Nec commune bonum peterant ſpectare, neque ullis</l>
                     <l>Moribus inter ſe ſcibant neque legibus uti.</l>
                  </q>
With which deſcription of the elder World agrees <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Politicks, Nudi enim &amp; ſine ſtragulis magnam partem foris &amp; ſub dio vitam colebant;</hi> and the ſame <hi>Plato</hi> in his third Book <hi>de Legibus</hi> ſuppoſeth, that thoſe relicks of Men that eſcaped the ancient Deluges by flight into the Mountains became perfectly ignorant in proceſs of time of thoſe Arts and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of humane Life, which poſſibly their Progenitors might have been better acquainted with.</p>
               <p>But we need not go ſo far for a full conviction of that admirable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and Improvement of Arts and other things, eſpecially ſuch as are neceſſary for humane Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:64147:81"/>In matters Aſtronomical we have a far greater light than what was two thouſand years ſince; for we find the old <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Heavenly Syſtem called ſince in queſtion by <hi>Copernicus, Galilaeus,</hi> and <hi>Kepler;</hi> the ſolidity of the Orbs detected to be untrue, by the plain diſcovery of <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> and others; the new diſcoveries of Stars and Aſteriſms, and their figures, by the help of the Teleſcope, demonſtratively and to the ſenſe.</p>
               <p>In matters Philoſophical many new Diſcoveries have been made by Experiences, whereunto the Ancients never attained: And although the Bodies of Men, Animals and Inſects have been theſe many thouſands of years expoſed to the view and ſearch of diligent Phyſicians and Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, yet it is a wonder to ſee what new Diſcoveries have been made in Anatomical Diſſections and Obſervations, which ſeem wholly hidden to the Ancients; as thoſe of the Circulation of the Blood by Doctor <hi>Harvey;</hi> the <hi>Venae lacteae</hi> by <hi>Aſellius;</hi> the <hi>Repoſitorium Chyli</hi> of <hi>Pecquet,</hi> with the method of its deduction into the <hi>Vena cava;</hi> the proceſs of Generation and of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative actions; the curious Diſcoveries of the Parts and Faculties of ſmall Inſects, by the help of the Microſcope, rendred by <hi>Malpighius</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Again, the great Diſcoveries that have been made by the means of Pyrotechny and Chymiſtry, which in late Ages have attained to a greater height than formerly.</p>
               <p>Again, in matters Mechanical, although it be true that this latter Age hath not arrived to that incredible skill of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> yet Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical powers have been ſtrangely improved, as we ſee in the late im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the late diſcovery of the Motion of the <hi>Pendulum,</hi> whereby the portions of Time are not only meaſured with an incredible exactneſs, but the uſe thereof tranſlated unto Watches, Clocks, and other Engins; ſo we have high advancement of Dialling, Clocks, Pumps, Fountains and other Motions beyond the acqueſts of former Ages.</p>
               <p>And although the Art of Navigation hath been very ancient, and the uſe of the Mariner's Needle, which ſome carry up to <hi>Amalpes</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> in the year of Chriſt 1360; others to the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and by them diſcovered to <hi>Paulus Venetus;</hi> others carry it up to King <hi>David:</hi> yet the Art of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation hath been ſince greatly improved, and many excellent Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in relation to the Inclination and Variation of the Magnetick Needle. To theſe we may add the uſe of Guns, Gunpowder, and Printing, which though by ſome aſſerted to be of long uſe in <hi>China,</hi> yet in this Weſtern part of the World the original of the Invention hath its known <hi>Epocha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe and many more Inſtances of the like kind it may appear, That many Inventions and Diſcoveries of things not only of curioſity but of uſe and convenience to Mankind have had their known and certain <hi>Epochae,</hi> or a ſufficient evidence of times when they were not uſed or known in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The conſequence of this Suppoſition ſeems to be this; That in as much as theſe had their diſcoveries within known Periods, it is not ſuppoſable that the ſucceſſions of Mankind could have been without a Beginning, but rather that they had a Beginning within a reaſonable time: for it is not conceptible that in an infinite, or indeed in a very long period of Revolutions of Mankind, thoſe or any things of this kind diſcoverable would have been of ſo late and puiſne a diſcovery: This is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64147:81"/>
the Argument of <hi>Lucretius,</hi> who though an Aſſerter of the Eternity of Matter and Motion, yet together with his Maſter <hi>Epicurus</hi> aſſerts a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this World which we now behold, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5.</p>

                  <l>Quare etiam quaedam nunc artes expoliuntur,</l>

                  <l>Multa, modo organici melicos peperere ſonores;</l>

               <p>And upon the ſame account <hi>Macrobius l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. in <hi>Somnium Scipionis; Si enim ab initio, imò ante initium fuit mundus, ut Philoſophi volunt, Cur per innumerabilem ſeriem ſeculorum non fuerat Cultus quo nunc utimur inventus? Non Literarum uſus quo ſolo memoriae fulcitur Eternitas? Cur denique multa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum rerum experientia ad aliquas gentes recenti aetate pervenit? ut ecce Galli vitem vel cultum oleae, Roma jam adoleſcente, didicerunt; aliae verò gentes adhuc multa neſciunt quae nobis inventa placuerunt. Haec omnia videntur aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitati rerum repugnare, dum opinari nos faciunt certo mundi principio paulatim ſingula quaeque coepiſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although this Argument at the firſt view may ſeem to have much of evidence in it of the Origination of Mankind, yet it ſeems too weak to lay any great weight, at leaſt ſingly, upon it, as will appear by what follows; though in conſort with other Inſtances it hath its uſe and weight.</p>
               <p>The Diſcovery or Invention of things may ſeem to be upon theſe, or ſome of theſe Methods.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſeems to me that ſome things have been diſcovered unto Mankind by a more immediate interpoſition of the Divine Providence, or the miniſtration of Angels; as for inſtance, the Medicinal Virtue of ſome Herbs, Vegetables, or Minerals, that lye not in the ordinary road of Experience, or analogical collection from Circumſtances, Signatures, or Obſervation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some things were diſcovered experimentally, though perchance not intentionally, or by deſign in the firſt diſcovery: And thus probably the Virtues of ordinary Simples came to be diſcovered; for the Food of Mankind being anciently Herbs and Fruits, or at leaſt of ſuch of Mankind who either through choice, cuſtom or neceſſity were driven to that abſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious Diet, there did doubtleſs occurr the experience of various tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments and operations of thoſe Herbs; ſome purgative, ſome emetick, ſome ſudorifick, ſome aſtringent, which gave Men opportunity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting them into ſeveral ranks and uſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some things were diſcovered <hi>ex praenotis, &amp; per viam rationalis diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſus:</hi> Thus probably Men by the Signatures, Taſts and Colours of Herbs, bearing analogy to other things they knew, concluded fairly touching their Nature and Uſe, which by Tryal and Experience they improved into more fixed and ſtable Theorems and Concluſions: And upon this account alſo many Practical Arts, eſpecially relating to Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Weight, Meaſure and Mechaniſm had their production; for the Rudiments of Proportion being lodged in the Mind, they ſeem to have grown intentionally and <hi>ex industria</hi> into thoſe various practices of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64147:82"/>
Arithmetick, Geometry, and Mechanicks reſulting from thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>per media proceſſus rationalis;</hi> and thus thoſe practices of the Rules of Proportion, Mechanical Motions, Staticks, Architecture, Navigation, Meaſuring of Diſtances and Quantities, and infinite more did ariſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some things in their firſt diſcovery ſeem purely accidental, and although poſſibly the operation of Reaſon and Tryal and Experiment might or may carry on the Invention into farther Improvements and Advances, yet in the very firſt <hi>primo primum</hi> of the Diſcovery it may be accidental: The old, whether true or fabulous Diſcovery of Fire may ſerve to explain my conception; wherein it is ſuppoſed, that one ſitting upon a Hill and tumbling down Flint ſtones, upon the colliſion thereof he obſerved ſparks of Fire, which nevertheleſs he after improved by adding combuſtible materials to it; and doubtleſs upon ſuch and the like occurrences many Chymical and other accidental Diſcoveries have been made, beſides and beyond and without the intention of the Operator: And I well knew a Perſon that had not capacity enough to deduce any thing of curioſity <hi>per proceſſum rationalem,</hi> yet by accidental dealing with Water and ſome Canes did arrive to a moſt admirable excellence in ſome Mechanical Works of that nature, though he never had the Wit to give a reaſon of his performance of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some things have been found out by a kind of neceſſity and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Humane Nature; ſuch as Clothes, Societies, Places of Defence and Habitation, and poſſibly much of the plainer ſort of Tillage and Husbandry; <hi>Venter magiſter artis, ingeniíque largitor:</hi> and commonly theſe were the earlieſt Inventions, becauſe Nature ſtood early in need of them. And hence it came to paſs, that they who had <hi>Coelum clementius,</hi> that afforded them neceſſaries without the aſſiſtance of conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, continued longeſt rude and uncultivated. And therefore if the Husbandry of <hi>Ceres</hi> or <hi>Triptolemus</hi> came late into the World, it was becauſe thoſe Eaſtern Countries then inhabited abounded with plenty of Fruits, which ſupplied the defect of Husbandry till the World grew more diſperſed and fuller of Inhabitants, and tranſmigrated into parts of leſs natural fertility.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some things have been diſcovered not only by the Ingeny and Induſtry of Mankind, but even the inferior Animals have ſubminiſtred unto Man the invention or diſcovery of many things both Natural and Artificial and Medicinal, unto which they are guided, and in which they are directed by ſecret and untaught inſtincts, which would be infinite to proſecute. The Fable or Hiſtory of <hi>Glaucus</hi> obſerving Fiſhes to leap into the Sea, upon taſting an Herb by the ſhore; the Weaſel uſing Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane as an Antidote; the wounded Stag uſing Dittany to draw out the Arrow, (if true) and divers others, give us ſome Analogical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>And theſe are ordinarily the Methods of Diſcoveries. The Things or Objects diſcovered are principally of two kinds; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Such things as are already lodged in Nature, as Natural Cauſes and Effects, and thoſe various <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Nature, whereof ſome lye more open to our Senſes and daily obſervation; others are more occult and hidden, and though acceſſible in ſome meaſure to our Senſes, yet not without great ſearch and ſcrutiny, or ſome happy accident; others again are ſuch as we cannot
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64147:82"/>
attain to any clear ſenſible diſcovery of them, either by reaſon of their remoteneſs, diſtance, and unacceſſibleneſs, as the Heavenly Bodies and things cloſed up in the bowels of the Earth; or by reaſon of their ſubtil and curious texture, eſcaping the clear and immediate acceſs of Senſe, as Spiritual Natures, the Soul and its various Faculties and Operations, and the Reaſons or Methods of them, wherein for the moſt part our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts touching them are but Opinion and Conjecture, wherein Men vary according to the variety of their Apprehenſions and Phantaſies, and wherein (becauſe they want that manuduction of Senſe which is our beſt and ſureſt Guide in the firſt Inſtance in matters Natural) Men range into incertain, inevident, and unſtable Notions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such things as are Artificial, wherein ſome Diſcoveries are ſimply new, others are but acceſſions and additaments to things that were before mentioned: Some things are of convenience, utility or neceſſity to Humane Nature or the condition of Mankind; ſome things are of curioſity: ſome things are found out caſually or accidentally; ſome things intentionally, and out of thoſe Principles or Notions that ſeem to be lodged originally in the Mind.</p>
               <p>Now upon theſe Conſiderations premiſed, it ſeems that the late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of many things in Nature, and many Inventions in Art are not a ſufficient Evidence of the Origination or late Origination of Mankind, at leaſt taken ſingly and apart.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In things Natural the variety is ſo great, and the various combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations therein ſo many, that it ſeems poſſible that there ſhould not have been a full diſcovery of the whole ſtate of things Natural unto the Minds of Men, although there were ſuppoſed an eternal duration of Mankind. We may give our ſelves a <hi>Specimen</hi> hereof, if we look but back upon that one Piece of Nature with which we have reaſon to be beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, namely, our ſelves; which by reaſon of our vicinity to our ſelves, our daily converſation with our ſelves and others of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> our daily neceſſities and opportunities of inquiring into our ſelves, and the narrowneſs of our own nature in compariſon of the vaſt and various bulk of other things, ſeems to render us a Subject capable of being very fully diſcovered. And beſides all this, the more inquiſitive and judicious part of Mankind have induſtriouſly ſet themſelves for many Ages to make the beſt diſcovery they could of the nature of Man. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> the Father of Phyſicians, who lived in the 82<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and above 2000 years ſince buſied himſelf much and profoundly in this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; and a ſucceſſion of induſtrious, obſerving and learned Phyſicians and Naturaliſts have purſued the Chaſe with all care and vigilancy, and by the help of Anatomical Diſſections have ſearched into thoſe various <hi>Maeanders</hi> of the Veins, Arteries, Nerves and Integrals of the Humane Body: Yet for all this, in this ſenſible and narrow part of Humane Nature, the husk and ſhell thereof, how much remains after all this whereof we are utterly ignorant? So that notwithſtanding all the Diſcoveries that have been made by the Ancients, and thoſe more curious and plentiful Diſcoveries by the latter Ages, there ſtill remains ſo much undiſcovered that leaves ſtill room for Admiration and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and gives us a powerful conviction of our Ignorance, that the things we know in this little narrow obvious part of Nature the

Body of Man is the leaſt part of that we know not touching the ſame.</p>
               <p>But when we yet conſider how ſmall a part of the Humane Nature is that which is the Corporeal part; and how little we know with any tolerable certainty touching the more noble Parts, Acts and Operations of the Humane Nature, the Principle of Life, Senſe, and Intellection, we have ſtill reaſon to conclude that this little, narrow, near Subject of our Knowledge is yet very difficult for us actually and fully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and furniſheth our ſearch with more Materials than we are poſſibly able to exhauſt with all our Induſtry, Care, Study, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. When I conſider thoſe difficulties that occurr touching the Production of that we call the Soul, whence it is, what it is, what power it is that performs the <hi>proceſſus formativus</hi> that digeſts, diſpoſes, models the <hi>prima ſtamina naturae humanae</hi> that acts with moſt admirable skill, dexterity, infallible order, and in the moſt incomparable way of Intelligence, and yet wholly deſtitute of thoſe Organs whereby we exerciſe the operations of Life, Senſe, and Intellection. That incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable accommodation of all parts and things fitteſt for uſe, for time, for convenience: Again, when I conſider thoſe various powers of the Senſible Nature, that Regiment that it performs and exerciſeth by the Spirits, Nerves, and Muſcles; the admirable powers of Senſation, of Phantaſie, of Memory, in what Salvatories or Repoſitories the <hi>Species</hi> of things paſt are conſerved: Again, when I conſider the ſtrange powers of Intellection, Ratiocination, Reminiſcence, and what that Thing or Nature is that performs all thoſe various operations: And when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how little, how incertain, how contradictory thoſe Sentiments of Mankind have been touching theſe things, wherein nevertheleſs they have ſearched and toyled Age after Age; I muſt needs conclude, That if we had no other ſubject of our ſearch and enquiry beſides our ſelves, we ſhould have for ought I know for infinite Ages a continued ſtock for our diſcovery; and when we had learned much, yet ſtill even in this narrow Subject there would be ſtill ſomewhat to be learned; and we ſhould never be able actually to overtake the plenary diſcovery of what would remain;
<q>Sic rota poſterior currit, ſed in axe ſecundo.</q>
And if this one ſmall near piece of Nature ſtill affords new matter for our diſcovery, where or when ſhould we be ever able to ſearch out all the vaſt Treaſuries of Objective Knowledge that lyes within the compaſs of the Univerſe? So that the new Diſcoveries that have been made in Natural things is not a ſufficient evidence of the newneſs of the exiſtence of Mankind, becauſe of that inexhauſtible Magazin of Natural Cauſes and Effects which poſſibly will ſtore Mankind with new Diſcoveries unto an everlaſting continuance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the ſame that is ſaid for the redundance of matters intelligible and cognoſcible in things Natural, may be alſo applied to things Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. There are theſe things that render Artificial Inventions prodigiouſly fertil and various: 1. The variety of the materials of things that may be applied to Artificial ends and uſes; as we have Iron, Braſs, Wood, Stones, Sounds, Light, Figuration, Tactile qualities; ſome things of a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64147:83"/>
more active, ſome things of a more paſſive nature; ſome things diverſified in degrees of heat, cold, dryneſs, moiſture; various Elements, Meteors: and infinite variety of theſe Materials we have, which may be the material conſtituents or ingredients into Artificial Structures, Engins, Motions, or Effects. 2. The variety of the Apprehenſions and Fancies of ſeveral Men in the deſtination and application of things to ſeveral ends and uſes; and this ariſing in them partly by the various texture and frame of their very temper of their Brains, Blood, and Spirits; partly by variety of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, partly by Neceſſity, partly by Accidental Emergency: by this means poſſibly the ſame Material is variouſly managed into various Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, according to this variety of Phantaſy or Imagination. As take the ſame Wool, for inſtance, one Men felts it into a Hat, another weaves it into Cloth, another weaves it into Kerſey or Serge, another weaves it into Arras; and poſſibly theſe variouſly ſubdiverſified according to the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy of the Artificer: For it is moſt certain that there is not greater variety in the figures and complexions of Mens Faces and Features, and in the contemperations of their natural Humours, than there is in their Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies, Apprehenſions and Inclinations. And hence it is that, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the texture of <hi>Zeuxes</hi> or <hi>Apelles</hi> inclines him to the invention or improving of Painting, <hi>Archimedes</hi> to Mechanical Motions, <hi>Euclid</hi> to Geometrical Concluſions: and hence it muſt neceſſarily come to paſs, that according to the variety of Men that either caſually or induſtriouſly apply themſelves to Artificial Diſcoveries or Inventions, there will enſue variety of Inventions. That Invention that did ariſe from the <hi>Genius</hi> or temperament of the Phantaſie or Imagination of <hi>Apelles,</hi> would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably never in the ſame individual Invention have been found out before him, though the World of Men had laſted millions of Years before him; becauſe perchance in that long Period no Man had ever the ſame Syntax of Phantaſie or Imagination that he had, and conſequently though ſome Artificial Inventions are as it were of that common congruity to the general Phantaſies of Men; or ſeem to ariſe upon a common ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the uſe or exigence of Mankind, as digging, planting, ploughing, ſowing, making of Apparel and Houſes; yet ſome have that particular reſpect or cognation to the Phantaſie of this or that particular Man, that they would never have been found out till ſuch a Man had had his being in the World; and conſequently the Invention was not found ſooner, becauſe the Man to whoſe Phantaſie this Invention was accommodate was not born nor lived ſooner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The variety of Application and Combination of ſeveral Materials of Artificial things in their ſeveral Artificial Complements: For it is very plain, that even where things are finite and determinate in their number, yet they ariſe to a ſtrange and prodigious multitude, if not indefinitude, by their various Poſitions, Combinations, and Conjunctions: The Letters of the Alphabet, which ariſe from the ſeveral apertures and conjunctions of the Tongue, the Teeth, the Palate, the Lips, the Throat, are but 24 in number, yet various combinations of theſe Letters are the formal conſtituents of all the Words and Languages in the World: And yet all the Words and Languages in the World do not amount to the hundredth part of thoſe other articulate Languages that might be made out of the remaining combinations of the Letters of the Alphabet, which are not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64147:84"/>
in uſe in any or all the Languages of the World. The general diviſion of Lines in Geometry is into ſtreight and crooked, but the various com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and poſitions of theſe two ſorts of Lines would make more Figures of Superficies than all the Ages of the World could poſſibly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or deſcribe.</p>
               <p>And from this variety of Materials, variety of Phantaſies and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and variety of Combinations or Junctures of things, we may reaſonably conclude that the multitude of Artificials is inexhauſtible; and that although there be many new Inventions diſcovered daily which were not diſcovered before, yet that alone is no ſufficient Argument of the Novity of Mankind; for this Magazin of Artificials is ſo fruitful, vaſt, and indeterminate, that if the World ſhould laſt millions of Ages there would be a ſtore and ſupply for immenſe Ages, <hi>Et ſemper aliquid ultra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be poſſibly objected, That although the variety of Materials are great, and poſſibly indefinite and indeterminate, and ſo alſo of the Fancies of Men, and conſequently thoſe various combinations of things that are conſtituents of new Inventions, yet they are not Infinite: For although the combinations of the 24 Letters of the Alphabet are a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious number, yet if inſtead of 24 Letters there were 24 millions, as thoſe 24 millions are a finite number, ſo would all the changes and combinations thereof be finite, though perchance not eaſily computable by Arithmetick, in reſpect of the huge exceſs of the number; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, in an infinite Period of Time, though one of theſe combinations ſhould be exhibited in a million of Years, the whole number of combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations had been infinite Ages ſince exhauſted, and no combination left to make up the material or formal conſtituent of a new Invention.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; It is true, the combinations of things finite exiſting muſt needs be finite as well as the things themſelves. But, as I have before ſuppoſed, the Invention of Arts doth not only depend upon the exiſtence of the Materials of things Artificial, no nor ſingly upon the various combinations of thoſe Materials; but upon the Phantaſie, Deſign and Deſtination of Man, which is various, according to thoſe various Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments that have ingredience and influence into him: yea and poſſibly alſo upon certain junctures and concourſes of things that might never before befall any other. And therefore, as if upon a ſuppoſed Eternal Succeſſion of Mankind we ſhould find but one individual <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> ſo it is not impoſſible to ſuppoſe that <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> ſhould conſiſt of ſuch a Temperament and Conſtitution, ſuch a Phantaſie and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination as never any man before had exactly the like; and conſequently he might be the diſcoverer of ſome ſuch Invention as never before was diſcovered. Or if we ſhould be ſo hardy as to ſuppoſe a Man pre-exiſting in all things exactly like to <hi>Socrates,</hi> both in his Temperament, Body and Mind, yet poſſibly thoſe accidental Occurrences which excited the Imagination of <hi>Socrates</hi> to the diſcovery and compoſing of ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention might not fall in with that Man that is ſuppoſed of a perfect parity with <hi>Socrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For although perchance exiſting Individuals may not be actually Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, yet certain it is that the potential gradation of things may be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially Infinite, and ſo may the junctures of Occurrences be potentially Infinite; whereby it may come to paſs, that though an Eternal Succeſſion
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64147:84"/>
of Men were admitted, yet <hi>in ista hora</hi> a Man might be produced that had never <hi>parem omnibus gradibus &amp; numeris:</hi> And ſuch junctures of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences might happen <hi>in iſta hora</hi> that had never an exact parity of all Circumſtances, and the ſame exact weight and number of Occurrences in any antecedent portion of Eternity.</p>
               <p>And hence it may very eaſily come to paſs, that as any one Invention had not its exiſtence in a portion of a thouſand, two, ten, twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years before; ſo, if the Ages of Mankind were infinite, it might never have pre-exiſtence before, though the whole Race of Mankind had been induſtriouſly addicted <hi>ad ultimum poſſe</hi> to have diſcovered or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Artificial Inventions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Allay to the concludence of this Argument is this: That Mankind have been, and in many places are very remiſs and unactive in improving their knowledge and diſcovery of things Natural and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; and that which befalls one Man, or Age, or Place in this kind, may befall another: This may happen by lazineſs and ſloth, by an evil cuſtom, or by overflowing barbarouſneſs and want of improvement by Education: And upon this account we find a great want of Arts and Inventions in the Weſtern World, in <hi>Africa,</hi> and even nearer hand among the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> And if now by the acceſſion of Planters of better Education, or by the advanced Induſtry of ſome Inhabitant of thoſe barbarous Countries there ſhould be derived among them the Inventions of profitable or curious Arts, we could not with any ſufficient reaſon conclude that the World lately began in thoſe Countries, becauſe the Original of thoſe Arts and Inventions was but lately begun among them. If therefore thoſe People by reaſon of their Barbarous courſe of life might be ſtrangers unto Arts and Inventions for the ſpace of five hundred or a thouſand Years, why not for a much longer time? why not eternally? Since the very ſame ſupineneſs and negligence might as well poſſeſs thoſe Parts and Inhabitants for many Ages, as well as few; and for interminate Ages, as well as certain: and if at this day they ſhould diſcover and practiſe new Arts and Inventions, it were no greater Argument againſt the Eternity of their Succeſſion, than againſt their Continuance for thoſe many thouſand Years, which probably they have had in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Weſtern World.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Allay of this Obſervation ſeems to be this: That as in Kingdoms and Empires, ſo in Diſcoveries of Arts there ſeem to be very great viciſſitudes and circulations, which ſtrangely vary the Faces of Things and Countries; and this principally done, 1. By Wars and Victories: 2. By Floods, Inundations, or Epidemical Diſeaſes and Plagues.</p>
               <p>The Inſtances of the former are various. The <hi>Romans</hi> were a People civilized and improved into great Knowledge in Arts and Sciences, and in Civil and Military Government; and where they prevailed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and Victories, they did together with their Victories tranſmit Arts, Sciences, and excellent Methods of Government among even Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations, which quite altered oftentimes the former Face of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Countries, and by that means thoſe Arts which were not known before in thoſe Places, became in uſe and requeſt in thoſe Countries wherein before they were ſtrangers: not as if they then began for they
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64147:85"/>
had their Practice and Uſe long before among the <hi>Romans,</hi> though their tranſmiſſion and derivation into thoſe Countries that were conquered ſeemed new.</p>
               <p>Again, ſome Countries were <hi>benè morati,</hi> well diſciplined in Learning, Arts, and Knowledge, but poſſibly by the Irruption of numerous Armies of Barbarous People, thoſe Countries were quickly over-grown with Barbariſm and deſuetude from their former Civility and Knowledge, and degenerated into the Ignorance and Barbariſm of their Conquerors; ſo that in a reaſonable Period of time much of their ancient Knowledge and Arts was forgotten, as if they never had it. This was the condition of <hi>Greece</hi> the Learned Part of the World after their ſubjugation by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and this poſſibly may be the condition of <hi>China</hi> in a few years after the great Irruption and Devaſtation by the <hi>Tartars;</hi> wherein poſſibly if an Age or two hence the ſtate of things ſhould be judged according to the preſent appearance, it would be looked upon as if it had never been the habitation of thoſe Curious Arts which ſome time dwelt there: and poſſibly the ſetting on foot ſome of thoſe very Arts that were once well known in thoſe parts, would be looked upon as the <hi>Natales</hi> of thoſe Arts, or the firſt Inchoation of them, Wars and Deſolations having obliterated the Monuments of their former practices; which yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs would be in truth but the reviving of thoſe Arts which were long before practiſed, though intermitted and interrupted by the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Wars.</p>
               <p>And upon the ſame account are thoſe alterations that have hapned in the condition and ſtate of People by other accidents, as Inundations, Epidemical Diſeaſes, Corruption of the Air in ſome Parts and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, either by ſome eruption of pernicious Vapours, or other Incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the Heavens. <hi>Plato</hi> in his third Book <hi>de Legibus,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, though he ſuppoſe an interminate Beginning of Mankind, and that there were ſucceſſively Cities, Laws, and Arts; yet he ſuppoſeth that upon theſe and the like Occurrences, thoſe that eſcaped theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Calamities betook themſelves to the Mountains, kept Sheep, and preſerved the <hi>Species</hi> of Mankind; but moſt of thoſe Arts and Sciences which formerly were common, became diſuſed and forgotten among them: But after Mankind multiplying, they deſcended into the Vallies, and by degrees, mutual converſation, the neceſſity of their condition, and the due conſideration of things did gradually revive thoſe Arts which Men had formerly loſt by long intermiſſion. For ſuch is the <hi>indoles</hi> of the Humane Nature, where it is not ſtrangely over-grown with Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs, that it will by a kind of Natural Sagacity diſcover things, eſpecially neceſſary for the uſe of Humane Life and Society; as Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, Laws, Government, Architecture, Clothing, and the like; as Bees or Ants provide for their common habitation and ſupply.</p>
               <p>Upon all which it may ſeem that we are over-haſty when we conclude, That becauſe Arts or Sciences do perchance diſcover themſelves firſt to our view in ſuch Places or Ages, that therefore this was their firſt and primitive production, or that they were never before. For it may very reaſonably be, that thoſe or the like Arts might have been either in other places, and by a kind of migration or circulation be tranſmitted to thoſe new places either by Armies or Colonies deduced hither; or that even
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64147:85"/>
among the ſame People or Nation theſe Arts were ſometimes flouriſhing, though poſſibly having received ſome intermiſſion by great Accidents and Occurrences, they again do <hi>repullulare</hi> and revive upon the opportunity of Peace, Trade, Commerce and Popular Increaſe. Nay many times it comes to paſs, as is before obſerved, That when People are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, ſo that their places grow ſtrait and narrow, and their ſupplies not proportionable to their number, neceſſity and exigence, it gives an edge to their Induſtry and Invention, and produceth new Diſcoveries of things that were either not known before, or forgotten: And even this one thing hath advanced the <hi>Dutch</hi> to that eminence of Manufacture, Induſtry and Arts, that they exceed the reſt of the World therein.</p>
               <p>We may have an Inſtance of this Circulation of Arts even in this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in that which is our great Manufacture, namely, Woollen Cloth: It appears very plainly by thoſe ancient Gilds that were ſettled in <hi>England</hi> for this Manufacture, as at <hi>Lincoln, York, Oxford</hi> and divers other Cities, that in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 2. and <hi>R.</hi> 1. this Kingdom greatly flouriſhed in that Art: but by the troubleſom Wars in the time of King <hi>John, H.</hi> 3. and alſo in the times of <hi>E.</hi> 1. and <hi>E.</hi> 2. this Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was wholly loſt, and all our Trade ran out in Wools, Wool-fells, and Leather carried out <hi>in ſpecie;</hi> and the Manufacture, during thoſe Warly times, held its courſe in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns; but by the Wiſdom and peaceable times of <hi>E.</hi> 3. and his fair treating of forein Artiſts, which he invited and entertained in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he regained that Art hither again, which for near one hundred Years had been for the moſt part intermitted, which hath hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the great Wealth and Benefit of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>So that we are not to conclude every new appearance of any Art or Science is the firſt production of it, but as they ſay of the River <hi>Tigris</hi> and ſome others, they ſink into the ground, and keep a ſubterranean courſe, it may be 40 or 50 miles, and then break out above ground again, which is not ſo much a new River, as the continuation and new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the old: So many times it falls out with Arts and Sciences, though they have their non-appearances for ſome Ages, and then ſeem firſt to diſcover themſelves where before they were not known, it is not ſo much the firſt production of the Art as a tranſition, or at leaſt a reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of what poſſibly was either before in another, or in the ſame Country or People: And thus ſome tell us that Guns and Printing, though but lately diſcovered in <hi>Europe,</hi> yet were of far ancienter uſe in <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that notwithſtanding this Conſideration of the late Invention of Arts, or Diſcoveries of things Natural or Artificial, Mankind might have had an infinite ſucceſſion, or at leaſt ſuch a continuance as ſurmounts all thoſe Accounts which the moſt prodigal Computations have given: and that Saying of the Wiſe Man may be verified, <hi>Eccleſiast.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The thing that hath been is that which ſhall be, and that which hath been done is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing under the Sun: Is there any thing whereof it may be ſaid, See, this is new? It hath been already of old time before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall here add a farther Conſideration, becauſe it hath a cognation with the Subject of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:64147:86"/>There ſeems to be very probable Conjectures made touching the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of Mankind, becauſe there ſeems to be one Radical Language from which all others have their derivation, though ſome carry in them more, ſome leſs Memorials of their Original, as they were more or leſs remote in their Inception.</p>
               <p>The Languages of the World may be aptly enough divided into the <hi>Primo primae,</hi> the <hi>Primo ſecundae,</hi> and the <hi>Secundo ſecundae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Language which I call <hi>Primo primae</hi> muſt needs be but one, if the Original of Mankind were but two common Parents of either Sex, as the Holy Scriptures teach us; and this one Language they muſt needs learn either from a conformation of Voices by the Angels, ſuch might that vocal Language be between Almighty God by the miniſtration of Angels, and <hi>Adam,</hi> whereof we read in the firſt and ſecond Chapters of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> or it muſt be an inſtituted Language, choſen by <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> by which he gave the ſeveral Beaſts their names, and maintained diſcourſe with GOD, and the Woman with the Serpent: For although it is as natural to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to expreſs their Deſires, Paſſions, and Conceptions vocally, as it is for Brutes to uſe their natural vocal Signs, though of a more ſimple and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect kind; yet the forming of Languages into this or that particular faſhion or mode, whereby Conceptions may be rendred intelligible to others, is a buſineſs of Inſtitution, Diſcipline, Intention and Conſent. But what this firſt Language of our firſt Parents was, is difficult for us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin: ſome think it was the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and from thence they derive other Languages; others think that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> Language was the Original, becauſe it is the moſt ſimple, conſiſting moſt of monoſyllables, the moſt natural, fitting the apertures and flexures of the Lips and Tongue with the greateſt eaſe, and yet having the greateſt multiplicity and variety of Words; others again contend for the <hi>Scythian</hi> Language as the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: all founded upon conjectural Reaſons.</p>
               <p>But when we conſider how ſoon Languages are changed, and what a tract of time there was between the Creation and the Flood, and from thence to <hi>Moſes,</hi> it may be difficult to ſuppoſe that that Language conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo long in its purity and integrity; poſſibly if in any Line it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in its integrity, it might be in the Line and Family of <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſo down to the Confuſion of Languages at the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is hard to determin what that Primitive Language was: the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Samaritan</hi> bids faireſt for it, 1. In reſpect of its Antiquity; 2. In reſpect of many Languages, eſpecially of the Eaſt, that ſeem to be derived from it, as the <hi>Caldee, Egyptian, Phenician, Syriack, Arabick,</hi> which have a great cognation with it, and derivation, as it ſeems, from it.</p>
               <p>And though poſſibly in thoſe Elder times, as in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> theſe ſeveral Languages might be but as ſo many ſeveral Dialects of the ſame Language, whereby it came to paſs that <hi>Abraham,</hi> though brought up in <hi>Caldea</hi> or <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> held conference with the King of <hi>Gerar</hi> and the Children of <hi>Heth,</hi> that were <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and as ſome think, uſed the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language; his Servant alſo readily conferred with <hi>Laban</hi> the <hi>Syrian: Iſaac</hi> alſo had conference with the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> yet it is apparent that in proceſs of time they grew into diſtinct Languages, unintelligible each to other: The Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> underſtood not the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Language when they came down for Corn, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.23. neither
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64147:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did they afterward underſtand ordinarily the <hi>Syrian</hi> Language, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.26. nor the <hi>Caldean</hi> Language, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.15.</p>
               <p>But although it be commonly thought the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language was the common Language of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> yet it ſeems hard that the Holy and ſuppoſed Primitive Language ſhould be preſerved only in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of accurſed <hi>Canaan,</hi> and from them derived to the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Holy Seed.</p>
               <p>As touching the Language of the <hi>Seres</hi> or <hi>Chineſes,</hi> thoſe that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be the Primitive Language, do ſuppoſe that <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark firſt reſted upon the bordering Mountains of <hi>China,</hi> and that Country firſt peopled by the deſcendents of <hi>Noah;</hi> that they were not at the building of <hi>Babel.</hi> But this ſeems to be but a novel Conceit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Languages that were <hi>Secundo primae,</hi> were thoſe that hapned upon the Confuſion of Tongues, which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſuppoſe to be 70 or 72, from that place <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. verſ. 55. <hi>He hath divided the Nations according to the number of the Princes of Iſrael,</hi> or the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> but whether they were ſo many, or more, or leſs, is not poſſible to determin.</p>
               <p>Some ſuppoſe thoſe Languages which are ordinarily called <hi>Linguae matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> were ſome of thoſe Languages that aroſe at the Confuſion of Tongues, and are called <hi>Matrices,</hi> becauſe divers other, eſpecially of the <hi>European,</hi> ſeem to be much derived from them, namely, the <hi>Greek, Latin, Teutonick, Sclavonick, Scythian, Hungarian, Finnick, Cantabrian, Iriſh, Britiſh, Arabick, Friſick, Illyrian,</hi> and <hi>Jarygium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though theſe are taken to be <hi>Linguae matrices,</hi> yet much of their Languages ſeem to be borrowed from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Phenician</hi> Language; and though they ſuppoſe thoſe <hi>Linguae matrices</hi> might ariſe at the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Tongues, yet they were not totally eſtranged from that common Language which univerſally obtained before that Confuſion, which ſome think as before, was the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> ſome relicks of which Primitive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage were notwithſtanding that Confuſion retained as Indications and Monuments thereof, as <hi>Bochart</hi> in his <hi>Phaleg,</hi> and out of him Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> in his Book called <hi>The Court of the Gentiles,</hi> endeavours largely to prove.</p>

The third ſort of Languages, which I call <hi>Secundo ſecundae,</hi> are thoſe that have either been derived from thoſe that were <hi>Primo ſecundae,</hi> or that have been compounded out of other Languages, or taken up <hi>de novo</hi> of later times, or by all of thoſe ways have obtained in ſeveral parts of the World, as the <hi>French, Italian, Spaniſh, Daniſh, Engliſh,</hi> and divers others.</p>
               <p>Now if it can be well deduced that there was ſome ancient Primitive Language that by reaſonable Evidence can appear to be the common Root of all other Languages, it is reaſonable to conclude, That ſurely there was ſome one common Head that was the Beginning of Mankind; for without this Suppoſition it is hardly poſſible that there ſhould be a common Language at any time in the World, from which as from a common Root all the Languages of the World ſhould in proceſs of time be derived.</p>
               <p>But this Evidence alſo taken ſingly, lyes open to ſome Objections that weaken it upon theſe Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have not clear Evidence enough of any ſingle Primitive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor what that Primitive Language was if ſuch there hath been:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64147:87"/>
there might be in proceſs of time a thouſand ſucceſſive Languages, and many that went before have been loſt, and ſucceeded by others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe ſimilitudes of Words of one Language which are found in another, give us no ſufficient Demonſtrations which of them was Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive; the reſemblances of words ſignifying the ſame thing in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Language prove no more that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> was before the <hi>Greek,</hi> and lent Words to them, than that the <hi>Greek</hi> was before the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and lent the ſimilitude of Words to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we conſider almoſt any Language not before-hand or by ſome after means mancipated to Rules, we ſhall ſcarce find any that contain themſelves in the ſame Articulation, Accent or Pronunciation for the ſpace of three or four hundred Years, but are infinitely varied in proceſs of time from what they formerly were. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language that was common and uſual three or four hundred Years ſince, is ſcarce now intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible by us; yea and the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, though a regular Language, and reduced to a Grammatical Canon, yet a good Grammatical <hi>Grecian</hi> can hardly underſtand a Native <hi>Grecian,</hi> nor a Native <hi>Grecian</hi> the other at this day: yea we are told by <hi>Quintilian,</hi> as I remember, that in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf in proceſs of time the <hi>Latin</hi> Language was ſo altered, that the Prieſts could not readily underſtand the Hymns compoſed for their Idol-Service by the ancient Prieſts of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As ſucceſſion of Ages, ſo variety of places in the ſame Country and Nation gives ſuch variety of Dialects in the ſame Language, that one ſide of a Kingdom ſcarce underſtands the other: witneſs the four Dialects of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, and the ſeveral Pronunciations of the <hi>French</hi> in ſeveral parts of <hi>France,</hi> and the various Dialects of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the North and Weſt that render their Expreſſions many times unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible to the other, and both ſcarce intelligible to the Midland: various Provinces of the ſame Kingdom, and that at firſt uſed the ſame Language, in proceſs of time uſe various manners of Pronunciation, which in time alſo alter the ſtructure of the Words as they are ſpoken or written, which in farther proceſs of time alters the Language into ſeveral Dialects, as it did in <hi>Greece</hi> and other places.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Every Nation hath a certain humour or diſpoſition appropriate to it, which by a kind of Natural neceſſity frames the very Air of Words, Speech and Accents accommodate and ſimilar to that Natural humour or inclination;
<q>
                     <l>— Graiis dedit ore rotundo</l>
                     <l>Muſa loqui —</l>
                  </q>
In the very frame of the Speech of the <hi>Spaniard, Italian, French, Dutch, Welſh, Engliſh</hi> we may find a kind of Image of their Complexions and Tempers, ſuiting and framing their Speech, Accents, Tone, Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Vowels conform thereunto, no leſs than in their Gate and Geſture; and this very Account would in a little time diverſifie one and the ſame Language in the Mouths of ſeveral Nations, ſo that in a little ſpace they would not be the ſame.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Commerce and Trade with forein Nations gives great alterations in Languages, each Country borrowing ſome Words, Accents, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from the other, whereby in a little time it is quite altered, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64147:87"/>
becomes a mixt confuſed Language, made up of the Ingredients of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As in Clothes, ſo in Words, Phraſes, and Expreſſions there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly grow new Faſhions, whereby it comes to paſs that the ſame Words and Phraſes that were not uſed, or ſcarce underſtood in former Ages, become in Faſhion, Reputation and Vogue in another Age; and this obtains ſometims from the Courts of Princes, wherein a Word a little in requeſt ſoon grows in faſhion with the Gentry, and from them at the third hand paſſeth over to the Tradeſman or Countryman.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Many times the <hi>Literati</hi> and <hi>Scholares</hi> coyn new Words, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in common Speech or Writing in their Native Language, give Terminations and Idiotiſms ſutable to their Native Language, unto Words newly invented or tranſlated out of other Languages; which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times done out of Affectation, ſometimes out of Neceſſity, by reaſon of the want of ſufficient ſignificancy in their own Language; and when ſuch Phraſes or Words come abroad in printed Books, in Sermons or Orations, they become more general, and incorporate into the Native Language.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Many Languages of Countries are greatly altered and mingled, and ſometimes totally eradicated and loſt by Invaſions and Victories, or by tranſmiſſion of Colonies by Forein Princes of a different Language. Thus by the chacing the <hi>Britons</hi> out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Wales,</hi> their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was wholly exterminated from hence with them, and by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Incurſions and Invaſions of the <hi>Saxons, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language grew a kind of mixture of them all, which yet in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time hath been ſo much varied, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that was written in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 1. is not now intelligible.</p>
               <p>It is true that thoſe Languages that are not now Native, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were, but are preſerved in Writing or Rules or Canons, have long kept their ſimplicity, as the <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> which have been indeed preſerved from being loſt by vulgar uſe, but when a Language once becomes of vulgar uſe, it ſoon loſeth its integrity; thus the <hi>Latin</hi> degenerated into the <hi>Italian,</hi> and the very <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous by much where they are popularly uſed, than in the ancient Writings, wherein they have been preſerved and kept to their ancient integrity.</p>
               <p>Conſidering therefore the great inſtability of Languages, the great variations and changes to which they are ſubject, the great alterations that they have had, the great difficulty of finding any Language which (upon grounds barely of Reaſon, without Divine Revelation) we can ſafely call Original, and the great difficulty of deducing other Languages entirely from it: It is hard for us ſingly to lay any weight upon this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to prove the Origination of Man upon a meer Moral Account or Topical Ratiocination thereof.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. V.</hi> The Fourth Inſtance of Fact ſeeming to evince the Novity of Mankind, namely, the Inceptions of the Religions and Deities of the Heathens, and the deficiency of this Inſtance.</head>
               <p>REligion ſeems to be as connatural to Humane Nature as Reaſon, and poſſibly a more diſtinguiſhing property of Humane Nature than it: For almoſt in all ſenſible Creatures, eſpecially thoſe of the more perfect kind, a certain Image or weak Adumbration of ſomething like Reaſon appears, yet we find in no Creatures below Mankind any thing like Religion, or Veneration of a Deity: And thoſe faint Conjectures touching ſomething analogical to Religion obſerved in Elephants, are too weak to give any reaſonable admiſſion thereof in them.</p>
               <p>Religion therefore ſeems as ancient as Humanity it ſelf, at leaſt of ſome kind of dreſs or faſhion or other: therefore if we can arrive at the Inception of Religion, Veneration of a Deity, and thoſe Rites, Adorations, and Services that reſult from thence; we have reaſon to conjecture that the Inception of Mankind was not long before.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the Inception of Mankind is not doubted by <hi>Jews</hi> or Chriſtians, who acknowledge the Truth and Divine Authority of the Scriptures, that reveal and diſcover the Origination both of Mankind and the World, but the doubt only reſteth among thoſe of the Gentile World; it hath been thought a reaſonable Argument to convince the Heathen World of the Origination of Mankind, by diſcovering the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination not only of the Religious Worſhip of the Heathens, but even of thoſe very Deities which they celebrated and venerated, and paid that Religious Worſhip unto.</p>
               <p>And this Diſcovery of the Origination of their Heatheniſh Deities hath been endeavoured by two Methods: Firſt, by following the ancient Hiſtories of the <hi>Phenicians, Egyptians, Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> by which means they have traced up moſt if not all their Heatheniſh Deities to their Original, and their firſt Inauguration into Deities; whereas they were in their original for the moſt part but Men of great Note and Merit or Power in the Ancient World, or ſuch, who outgoing the ordinary rate of Mankind by ſome ſignal Excellence, Learning or Induſtry, were by the admiring inferior ſort of Men tranſlated into the Opinion and Veneration of Gods: and then there wanted not Poets and Prieſts to derive from them a Race and Progeny of Gods, which ſwelled into great Numbers, Pedigrees, and Genealogies of Gods and Heroes, <hi>Theogonia,</hi> which filled the ſuperiour World as Men filled the inferiour World by ſucceſſive Generations: And thoſe Authors that have given us an account of the <hi>Apotheoſes,</hi> the Inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration of the Heatheniſh Deities and their ſucceſſions, are many; eſpecially, <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in his firſt ſix Books; <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his firſt and ſecond Book <hi>De Praeparatione Evangelii,</hi> out of the Ancient Monuments of the <hi>Phenicians, Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Grecians;</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Stromat.</hi> who gives us an account of the <hi>Apotheoſes</hi> of <hi>Bacchus, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, Aeſculapius, Iſis, Ceres, Serapis, Apis</hi> and others, many of them, if not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64147:88"/>
all, having their being and tranſlation into Deities after the time of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and from the various Denominations of thoſe Heatheniſh Deities, ſome had one Name among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> another among the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> another among the <hi>Syrians,</hi> another among the <hi>Grecians;</hi> though poſſibly the Perſons themſelves were for the moſt part the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By carrying up the Original of moſt of the Ancient Deities of the Heathens, and reſolving them into <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Sons and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents, deducing by very probable Arguments that <hi>Noah</hi> was <hi>Saturn, Chronos, &amp;c.</hi> that <hi>Japhet</hi> was <hi>Neptune, Ham Jupiter, Shem Pluto, Canaan Mercury, Nimrod Bacchus, Magog Prometheus: vid. Bochart. in Phaleg, l.</hi> 1. <hi>Voſſius de Idololatriae origine &amp; progreſſu, l.</hi> 1. and others that have followed thoſe Learned and Ingenious Authors.</p>
               <p>But this Inference of the Recentneſs of Mankind from the Recentneſs of theſe <hi>Apotheoſes</hi> and Origination of Gentile Deities, ſeems alſo too weak to bear up this Suppoſition of the <hi>Novitas humani generis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe although poſſibly ſome of their Heatheniſh Deities might have been of a late Edition, yet there might be many more that might be ancienter, who either were antiquated and forgotten, or they were tranſlated to other Names and Succeſſors; it faring with Idol Gods as it doth with Words or Languages,
<q>
                     <l>— Cecidere cadéntque,</l>
                     <l>Quae jam ſunt in honore vocabula. —</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The luſt of Mens Fancies in Propagation of Deities was endleſs and unſatiable. We are told out of <hi>Varro</hi> that there were no leſs than thirty thouſand Heatheniſh Gods and Deities of all ſorts, which were known in his time; and how many more there might be whoſe Names and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip were long before that time antiquated, we cannot eaſily conjecture: only in all probability they were far more than thoſe that ſurvived. And therefore poſſibly there might be a Race and Succeſſion of <hi>Apotheoſes</hi> long antecedent to thoſe whoſe Originals we have given us in Ancient Hiſtories. We ſee how eaſily the <hi>Roman</hi> Calendar ſwells with new Conſecrations of Saints, and to what a multitude they have grown within leſs than the compaſs of one thouſand Years; and poſſibly had the World continued many thouſand years before it is ſuppoſed to have began, there might have been an interminate ſucceſſion of imaginary Deities, though many or moſt of their Names are now unknown, or the times of their Conſecrations forgotten.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet farther, if we ſhould ſuppoſe that this courſe of Idolatry began even ſhortly after the time of <hi>Noah</hi> and his three Sons, yet it is granted of all hands that the World had ſtood above 1600 Years before the invention of this kind of Idolatry: So that <hi>ex confeſſo</hi> this was not the firſt Religion in the World, neither did this Religion tread upon the Heels of the Origination of Mankind if Mankind was, and was 1600 Years before thoſe Deities were found out; and ſo this Religion cannot pretend to be coeval with Mankind, nor give us any ſufficient Indication of the Recentneſs of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But yet farther, it is very apparent that this Veneration of Men Conſecrated into Deities was not the ancienteſt Idolatry, much leſs the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64147:89"/>
ancienteſt Religion of the World: The Worſhipping of the Hoſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and Stars was an Idolatry that way far more ancient than this of the Heathen Gods made of Men: and this is an Evidence of the antecedency of that Idolatry of the Stars and Heavenly Bodies, in as much as when theſe new conſecrated Deities were made, they did as it were incorporate and affix them to that more ancient Idolatry, transferring the Names of moſt of their Gods to the Heavenly Bodies or Aſteriſms; as <hi>Saturn</hi> to the Star of <hi>Saturn, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter</hi> to the ſeveral Planetary Bodies; and to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> a prodigious number of Deities, as to the <hi>Sun, Phoebus, Apollo, Oſyris, Horus,</hi> and many more; to the <hi>Moon, Diana, Hecate, Venus, Aſtarte,</hi> and many others: So that although we ſhould allow the firſt Origination of thoſe Heatheniſh Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to have been when Hiſtorians give us an account, and not before; yet the Idolatry performed to the Heavenly or Elementary Bodies, the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> Stars, Fire, <hi>Aether, &amp;c.</hi> might have had a long practice among Men before the Invention of theſe later Deities.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But yet farther; in as much as Truth is certainly more ancient than Errour, we have reaſon to think that even before the ancienteſt Form of Idolatrous Worſhip in the World, even that of the Heavenly and Elementary Bodies, there was a True Worſhip of the True GOD, which might continue many Ages before any ſort of Idolatry prevailed in the World. So that it would be too raſh to conclude, That becauſe many of the Heatheniſh Deities had their known Original, that therefore no other Religion anteceded it, or that that Religion ſoon followed the Origination of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beſides all this there ſeems in the World, or at leaſt it is very poſſible to ſuppoſe certain viciſſitudes or relations not only in Arts and Sciences, as is before obſerved, but even in the Religions profeſſed, which may obtain ſucceſſively both in Places and Ages according to ſeveral viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes: We ſee that in the Country of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> ſhortly after the Flood Idolatry obtained among the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and the deſcendents of <hi>Ham;</hi> after that, the Knowledge and Worſhip of the True GOD among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for many Ages; and after that, a degeneration of the greateſt part thereof to Idolatry again in the Country of the Ten Tribes, and in a great part among the other Two Tribes: after that a Reformation and Reſtitution of the true Worſhip of God, in the return from the Captivity until Chriſt came; then the moſt ſound and perfect Religion, namely Chriſtianity, obtained for ſome time; then the return of Paganiſm, under perſecuting <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours; then the prevalence again of the Chriſtian Religion, under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and ſome that ſucceeded him; then Popiſh Superſtition; after that Turciſm and Mahumetaniſm, eſpecially in the parts of <hi>Greece, Paleſtine, Egypt</hi> and other parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> Thus various Profeſſions of Religion have had various Viciſſitudes, Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and ſucceſſive Alterations in Places and Ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> as I remember, with ſomewhat too much curioſity, and ſomewhat tranſported with too much fancifulneſs towards the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Heavenly Motions and Aſtrological Calculations, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that Religion hath had its ſucceſſive Alterations and Seaſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to certain Periodical Revolutions of the Planets: to the firſt Ages of the World he aſſigns the Preſidency of <hi>Saturn</hi> in matters of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64147:89"/>
Religion, and ſo downward, according to ſeveral ſucceſſive aſſigned Periods. Theſe are vain Conjectures, but they ſerve to explain what I mean, namely, That there may be ſucceſſive Alterations and Changes in the profeſſed Religion of the World in ſucceſſive Ages, and ſucceſſively in the ſame and other places of the World; whereby it will be hard to determin the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Commencement of Mankind by any one Form or Shape of Religion profeſſed in the World; for there may be ſome Religion antecedent to that which to us in this Age appears to have been the ancienteſt; but ſtill with this probable Concluſion, That ſince Truth is more ancient than Errour, it ſeems, that if there were any Religion that was Primitive in the World, it was the true Religion and true Worſhip of the true God, and not Idolatry, or worſhipping of Men or Idols, or the Works of Nature: and conſequently, that although we had no Monuments extant of any Religion ancienter than Idolatry, yet we had no reaſon to conclude that that Idolatrous Religion was the moſt ancient, or coeval to the Origination of Mankind: but rather, that Mankind had an Exiſtence in the World much antecedent to ſuch Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Worſhip, wherein the true God was for many Ages and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations truly worſhipped; and that partly by the ſubtilty of the Enemy of Mankind, partly by the apoſtacy and corruption of Humane Nature, and partly by the gradual decay of that true and ancient Tradition of the true Worſhip of the true God, Idolatry and Superſtition prevailed and obtained in the World.</p>
               <p>So that although it be a moſt certain Truth that Mankind had an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and was not without Beginning, yet the Evidence of the Origination of their Idolatry and Idolatrous Deities, is no ſufficient Proof or Evidence of the Origination of Mankind.</p>

               <p>Some of thoſe that have been inquiſitive into the Nature of Man have obſerved two things, which if they were true, would certainly give us an irrefragable Argument againſt the Eternal Succeſſion of Mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the Ages of Men grow gradually ſhorter and ſhorter: 2. That the Quantity of Humane Bodies was ordinarily heretofore much larger than they are now, and by a kind of gradual decay of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Vigour and Strength they decline to a ſmaller Stature. Thus <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch inter placita Philoſophorum</hi> tells us out of <hi>Empedocles, Nostrae aetatis homines priſcis comparatos infantium instar eſſe;</hi> and yet <hi>Empedocles</hi> lived
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64147:90"/>
upon the point of 2000 Years ſince, and <hi>Plutarch</hi> near 1500 Years ſince: and <hi>Pliny</hi> in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of his Natural Hiſtory, <hi>cap.</hi> 16. tells us the ſame, <hi>In plenum autem, cuncto mortalium generi minorem indies fieri propemodum obſervatur, raróſque patribus proceriores, conſumente ubertate ſeminum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſtione, in cujus vices nunc vergat aevum;</hi> and ſome Inſtances are given there and by the Additional Notes thereupon, of the great Sceletons of Mens Bodies found in ſeveral Ages, and that, <hi>Jam ante annos mille vates ille Homerus non ceſſavit minora corpora mortalium quam priſca conqueri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed if this natural Decreaſe of the Ages of Mens Lives and their Bodily Statures had held ſuch a proportion, it would not only avoid the poſſibility of an Eternal Succeſſion of Mankind, but would alſo give us a very late <hi>Epocha</hi> of their firſt Origination: For a very ancient Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, accompanied with ſuch a natural Decreaſe of Age and Stature by reaſon of that inſenſible but unintermitted decay of the ſtrength and ſtature of Nature, would have long ſince reduced Mankind to be but <hi>Ephemeraes</hi> in duration, and little other than Inſects in extent, or rather wholly determined, and put a Period to the whole <hi>Species</hi> infinite Ages paſt.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems that theſe are miſtaken complaints both of <hi>Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Homer;</hi> for ſurely in ſo great a Period as 2000 or 1500 Years elapſed ſince the death of thoſe Men the experiment of that Decreaſe would have been much more obvious and obſervable than we find it at this day. And although the nature of Mankind and of other Creatures ſubject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, if left to it ſelf without the continued <hi>Subſidium</hi> and Influence of the Divine Providence, would ſoon have faln into diſſolution <hi>per ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and without the inceſſant and corroding invaſions of ſo long a time; yet that ſame Power that firſt gave Being to things, hath ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported their ſucceſſive Generations in the ſame ſtate and natural vigour that it ever had, abating thoſe accidental occurrences that Sin, Exceſs, and other occurrences have brought into things.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore as touching the Decays of the Age of Man's Life; we do indeed learn from the Sacred Scripture (for no Humane Hiſtory reacheth ſo high) That the Lives of the Ancients were very long, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially before and for ſome time after the Flood; and this the Divine Wiſdom, Providence and Goodneſs ordered for moſt excellent Ends, namely, the Peopling of the New World, and that without any other means than his own Will, or at leaſt by means unknown to us: in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaxad</hi> the Son of <hi>Shem</hi> the great Age of the Ancients was cut to halves, namely to 440 Years; and in his Grand-child <hi>Peleg</hi> it was again cut to halves, for he lived but 242 Years; and it is alſo true that afterwards gradually to the days of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Lives of Men became ſhorter and ſhorter, till they fixed in that common Period of the Life of Man of 70 or 80 Years: and although it be true that the Hiſtories of former times give us ſome account of longer Lives of Men, as the Lives of <hi>Moſes, Aaron, Phinehas</hi> and ſome others, and thoſe mentioned by <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 48. and ſome in our own Experience; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſtates the ordinary Standard of the Life of Man to be 70, or at moſt 80 Years. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.10. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.32, 35.

               <p n="2">2. As touching the Stature of Men, it muſt be agreed that in former Ages there have been Giants and Men of extraordinary Stature: ſome Inſtances we have in the ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> and other Heathen Authors, and many more in the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament: But theſe were out of the ordinary and regular courſe of Nature.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems that ordinarily in all Ages the Statures of Men have little differed from what they now are, though according to the difference of Climates and ſituations there hath been ordinarily and regularly a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Stature of Men; many times Marſh-Countries, and thoſe that are of a temperate heat, producing Men of a larger ſize than Mountainous or thoſe Parts that are nearer the Sun, as ſome parts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the ordinary Stature of Mens Bodies is much the ſame now as anciently in the ſame Places or Regions appears by undeniable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: 1. The Bodies of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that have been exſiccated into Mummy, and lain ſome thouſands of Years, are found to have the ſame Stature or very little differing from what they now have; neither could they ſhrink into a ſhorter dimenſion by the length of time, conſidering that the Bones of all parts are joyned in their extremities, and could not become ſhorter without putrefaction, which occurrs not in thoſe exſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Bodies.</p>

As the firſt practical Rudiments of Arithmetick were taken from the Parts of the Humane Body in the <hi>Numeri primarii</hi> or <hi>Digitales,</hi> ſo in Geometry it is evident that the firſt notation of Meaſures was taken from the Parts of the Body of Man, and very ancient both among the <hi>Hebrews, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and theſe hold ſtill the ſame proportion as they did anciently.</p>

               <p>So that although the Humane Nature, as to that part of it that is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, is ſubject to changes and corruptions, and not of ſo firm and ſtable a conſiſtence as the Heavenly Bodies, and conſequently not ſo capable of a permanent and fixed conſtancy and continuation as they; yet by the conſtant and unintermitted Influx of the Divine Providence this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and mutable Nature of Mankind, yea and of the other perfect Animals, is admirably preſerved in the ſame meaſure of extent, regular procedure, and length of duration, as it hath been many Thouſands of Years ſince. Indeed it may be poſſibly true, that Accidents, accidental Occurrences, Intemperance, ill and noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> from the Earth, Waters, and intemperature of the Air, and other Accidents may in theſe latter Ages of the World produce ſome ſuch Diſeaſes and accidental Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders as may poſſibly more infeſt Mankind, and occaſion more Mortality than in former Ages. But as to the regular and ordinary courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural procedure and ſtate of things with Mankind, yea and other Animals, there ſeems to be little or no decay or variation from what hath been
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64147:92"/>
formerly (abating that Concuſſion which the Perfection of the Humane Nature ſuffered by the firſt Fall, and the ſhortning of Mens Lives, which is of another Conſideration.)</p>
               <p>And therefore I am not ſo apt to attribute that firm Conſiſtency of the Heavenly Bodies, their conſtant uninterrupted and invaried Motion, and thoſe other Indications of Permanency and Perpetuity, barely or ſingly to the ſingular and indiſſoluble Texture of their Nature or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as to that inceſſant Influx and unintermitted Cauſality of the Divine Power and Providence, which I ſo plainly ſee conſerves almoſt an equal regularity in the Motions, Proceſſes, Succeſſion, and Condition of poor, frail, Sublunary Bodies, which in their little Period belonging to their ſpecifical and individual Nature, have the ſame regularities and orders now as formerly, and in the whole Syſteme of their ſpecifical Nature preſerved in the ſucceſſive Individuals for many thouſands of years, obtain the ſame regularity, order, and method of Exiſtence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out decay, as it hath always held.</p>
               <p>This Suppoſition therefore of the gradual decay of the ſtate of Humane Nature, though <hi>in hypotheſi</hi> it would ſtrongly infer a late Origination of Man, yet it is falſe <hi>in theſi,</hi> and ſo concludes nothing touching the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hand, namely, the Origination of Mankind in ſome determinate Point of Finite Duration.</p>
               <p>An Ingenious Perſon, in a new Eſſay of Natural Philoſophy, Entituled, <hi>New Principles of Philoſophy, Part.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 22. tells us: That the Sun or Fiery Region gains gradually upon the Inferior Elements, ſo that the greateſt Declination of the Sun in the time of <hi>Hipparchus</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> was obſerved to be 23 <hi>deg.</hi> 52 <hi>min.</hi> but is ſince found to be reduced to 23 <hi>deg.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> or 28 <hi>min.</hi> which is a neceſſary Conſequent of the Suns gradual approximation towards the Earth: And if that ſhould be ſo, it were a neceſſary Argument of the Origination of the World, and with it of Mankind, within a certain Period of Time. But we muſt not be over haſty in allowing of that Poſition; for every Day gives us Inſtances how difficult it is exactly to find out the Diſtances of the Heavenly Bodies, Lines, and Motions, eſpecially when we come to meaſure them by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, or Parts of Minutes, which cannot be effected but by Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Inſtruments, which can never reach to a perfect exactneſs in this nature.</p>

               <p>IN Profane Authors and Hiſtorians we may find the Roots and Founders of many Kingdoms, Monarchies, and States, either by Victories, or by Emigrations, or by Inteſtine Commotions, or by common Conſent of the People or Inhabitants: Thus we find the Foundation of the later States or Monarchies in that Conſtitution at leaſt wherein they now ſtand,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64147:92"/>
or in ſome former Ages ſtood; As the Foundation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy in the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt; and before that, the Foundations of the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Daniſh</hi> Monarchies in this Kingdom, in the old Hiſtories of <hi>Hoveden, William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> and others. The like might be found for the Foundation of the <hi>French, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Daniſh</hi> Kingdoms, the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> and others. And ancienter Hiſtories give us an account of the Foundation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in <hi>Romulus,</hi> of the <hi>Grecian</hi> in <hi>Alexander,</hi> of the <hi>Perſian</hi> in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> in <hi>Nabonaſſar,</hi> of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> in <hi>Belus, Ninus, Semiramis.</hi> But yet, as is formerly obſerved, the Diſcovery of theſe Originations of Civil Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions into Kingdoms and Empires, do not lead us up to the Origination of Mankind, in the material Conſtituents of theſe Kingdoms and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires; for the Men that made up theſe Civil Bodies, or at leaſt their Anceſtors, had a Being before, though perchance under a different form of Civil Government, or under ſome other Names or Governour: As the ſeveral States of <hi>Greece,</hi> before their coalition into one Kingdom under <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Philip</hi> his Father, ſubſiſted in ſeveral ſmaller Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities or Commonwealths. For theſe kind of Hiſtories, though they afford us the Inception of new Governors or Governments, the <hi>Capita Regiminum,</hi> yet they give us not the <hi>Capita Familiarum:</hi> For though <hi>Romulus,</hi> for Inſtance, laid the Foundation of the City and Monarchy of <hi>Rome,</hi> and became as it were the Parent of that City and State, yet he was not the Parent of the Men that were the material Conſtituents of it, for they were a <hi>Farrago,</hi> or Collection of many people that had their Exiſtence long before in themſelves or their natural Progenitors. And upon the ſame account it is, that although many Hiſtories, as <hi>Diodorus Siculus, Thucidides, Herodotus,</hi> and others, do give us ſome true and ſome fabulous Derivations of the Names of Places or Countries, from the Men that ſeemed to be the Heads or Roots of thoſe Denominations, yet though they ſhould be all admitted to have truly given thoſe Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations to thoſe Countries, it doth by no means follow, that they were the Parents of the Inhabitants thereof; but they were ſuch, as either by War, or Power, or Election of the People, preſided in thoſe places, and gave them thereupon their denomination. Thus they tell us, That <hi>Helen</hi> gave the denomination to that part of <hi>Greece</hi> which was called <hi>Helenica,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Grecians</hi> were called <hi>Heleniſtae. Pelaſgus</hi> was he that gave the denomination to the <hi>Pelaſgi,</hi> another part of <hi>Greece. Latinus,</hi> to <hi>Latium</hi> and the <hi>Latins. Danaus,</hi> to another Cept of the <hi>Grecians. Tenes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cygnus,</hi> to <hi>Tenedos. Cretas,</hi> to <hi>Creta</hi> and the <hi>Cretians. Italus,</hi> as ſome ſay, to <hi>Italia</hi> and the <hi>Italians. Romulus,</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Romans.</hi> And infinite more ſuch Alluſions of Denominations of Countries and People, from the Name of him that preſided either in the Army, or Colony, or Countrey unto which ſuch Denominations were after given: And yet <hi>Latinus,</hi> nor <hi>Pelaſgus,</hi> nor <hi>Cretas,</hi> nor <hi>Helen,</hi> were any more the Natural Parents of all thoſe perſons that were called <hi>Pelaſgi,</hi> or <hi>Cretenſes,</hi> or <hi>Heleniſtae,</hi> or <hi>Latini;</hi> than <hi>Romulus</hi> was the Natural Parent of all thoſe people that were the firſt Inhabitants of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of thoſe that were after Incorporated and Infranchiſed into that Name, City, or Government. Indeed theſe were ſuch perſons, as perchance were the Captains of thoſe Armies or Colonies that were commanded by them,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64147:93"/>
or were ſuch as were the Heads or Founders of the Monarchies or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms that they thus founded; or ſuch as did <hi>ſuſtinere nomen &amp; perſonam totius communitatis,</hi> and thereby had the Power and Priviledge to give a Denomination to thoſe Countries or People they governed, calling them after their own Names: But they were not the Natural Roots, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Natural Parents of all them that bore their Denomination, though it may be very likely they had ſome Children of their own which might participate in that common Denomination.</p>
               <p>This therefore ſingly conſidered, namely, the Denomination of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from ſome one Perſon, is not ſufficient to aſſure us that all thoſe Perſons that bore that Denomination were derived by Natural Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from him whoſe Name they ſo bear; but though it may be true that ſuch a Denomination may be communicated to ſuch only, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended by Natural Propagation from him, as I ſhall hereafter inſtance, yet it may be otherwiſe: Therefore I have no reaſon to conclude, That whereſoever I find a Society of Men bearing the Denomination of one Man, that that Man was the Natural Parent of thoſe that bear that Denomination, unleſs I have ſome better Evidence than Alluſion of Names, ſince it is apparent in theſe Hiſtories that it is otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Upon this Reaſon it ſeems plain, that it will not be poſſible from any Prophane Hiſtory to find the Original Parents of any one Kingdom, much leſs of Mankind. It is very evident indeed, that by help of a continuation of Prophane Hiſtories or other common Monuments well kept together, the Genealogies and Ramifications of ſome ſingle Families even to a vaſt and numerous extenſion may be preſerved. But that will not do the buſineſs that I intend. For it is rare, and beyond Example in any Author that I know, that the entire and complete Pedigree of the whole Deſcendents of any particular Family is deduced down through the ſpace of a thouſand Years laſt paſt; whereas ſuch Inſtances as muſt ſerve my turn muſt be ſuch as are at leaſt five thouſand Years old, or otherwiſe I ſhall fail in the application of this Topick now in hand to the Matter in queſtion.</p>
               <p>It remains therefore that for Inſtances of ſuch Antiquity uſeful to my purpoſe I muſt reſort to the ancienteſt Hiſtory, namely, the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which as it is a Hiſtory of the ancienteſt Times and Occurrences in the World, ſo it is a Hiſtory that was written at the greateſt diſtance from this Time, and neareſt to the Times and Things whereof he writes; no Hiſtory in the World being ſo ancient as this by near eight hundred Years, for ſo long lived <hi>Moſes</hi> the Author of this Book before <hi>Homer</hi> the firſt Prophane Hiſtorian that is extant.</p>
               <p>And if any Man ſhall object againſt the competency of this Inſtance, 1. Becauſe the ſame <hi>Moſes</hi> whom I uſe in this Topick is the perſon that aſſerts the thing <hi>de quo ambigitur,</hi> namely the firſt Production of Mankind, and therefore that he is incompetent in this Caſe: 2. Becauſe all that urge the Teſtimony of <hi>Moſes</hi> urge him as infallible, divinely inſpired, and ſo whatſoever he ſaith muſt not be contradicted; and upon ſuch a Suppoſition there were a compendious way of evincing the Queſtion in hand of the Inception of Mankind, by telling us that <hi>Moſes</hi> who wrote by an infallible Spirit and Inſpiration, tells us that Mankind was Created by GOD about 6669 Years ſince according to the <hi>Seventy;</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:64147:93"/>
and ſo there needs no farther Reaſon, nor can be any farther Controverſie touching it.</p>
               <p>To this I ſhall ſay theſe things: That although it is certain that <hi>Moſes</hi> was Inſpired by an Infallible Spirit in what he wrote, and that he doth in plain terms tell us that Man was at firſt Created by Almighty God, and therefore to me or any elſe that is ſatisfied of the Infallible Authority of the Holy Scripture, this is ſufficient to ſatisfie that the truth is as <hi>Moſes</hi> hath informed us, and there needs no other Argument to ſupport my Faith of the truth hereof: yet becauſe I am writing of thoſe Natural and Moral Evidences of this Truth that may be of ſtrength enough to evince the truth of this Aſſertion, upon the apparent Moral Evidences of the credibility of the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> I ſhall here urge the Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> for the Proof of the Matters of Fact in queſtion as I would urge <hi>Herodotus</hi> or <hi>Livy</hi> to prove a Matter of Fact alleged by them; and at this time and in this Diſpute ſhall only uſe his Teſtimony as a Moral Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Truth he aſſerts, as an Evidence of Credibility. And as I ſhall not exact a Subſcription to the Truths he delivers upon the account of his Infallibility, ſo it is not reaſon to deny that Credibility of what he relates, which would be allowed to a Prophane Author; eſpecially when it carries with it ſingly, without the contribution of the Suppoſition of a Divine Authority, as great an evidence of truth as any Hiſtory in World beſides.</p>
               <p>And as to that which is ſaid, That the Suppoſition of the truth of what <hi>Moſes</hi> aſſerts, is to ſuppoſe the thing controverted, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> aſſerts the Creation of Mankind: I ſay, 1. That I ſhall not at all inſtance in that Aſſertion as to determin the Queſtion, but only ſo far forth as it is a Moral Evidence of the truth of it; namely, That this was a thing believed near 4000 Years ſince by Wiſe Men, ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, and by them that were much nearer to the time wherein the Origination of Mankind and thoſe other Matters of Fact that are contributory to the Proof thereof was tranſacted; and therefore in common Reaſon muſt needs have a clearer Tradition and Evidence of the truth in this matter than the Ages ſo many thouſand Years after; but this I ſhall reſerve to its proper place. 2. In this place I ſhall not at all inſiſt upon the Tradition of <hi>Moſes</hi> touching the Creation of Man, but only upon thoſe Hiſtorical Narratives delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> relating to ſuch Matters of Fact that were nearer his time, and ſuch as he might very reaſonably know and deliver as an Hiſtoriographer; namely, the Propagation of Mankind after the Flood, and the Reduction of moſt of the conſiderable Nations of the World to their ſeveral Roots or Parents by Natural Propagation, and the credibility of his Relation touching it: Though even the credibility of this Relation of his gives a great Evidence and Atteſtation, even upon a Moral account to what he writes touching the Creation of Man, and thoſe parts of the Hiſtory antecedent to the Flood.</p>
               <p>The Sum therefore of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Hiſtory that I ſhall in this place make uſe of, is this:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a Univerſal Flood was brought upon the Earth in the Year 1656 after the ſuppoſed Creation of Man according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Account, although the <hi>Septuagint</hi> allows a longer Period between the Creation and the Flood.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:64147:94"/>2. That by that Univerſal Flood all Mankind were deſtroyed except eight perſons, namely, Noah, his Wife, his three Sons, <hi>Shem, Japhet,</hi> and <hi>Ham,</hi> and their Wives.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That all the Race of Mankind after this Flood, were derived by natural generation from theſe three Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> and their Wives.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the particular Deſcendents from theſe three Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> are truly deſcribed and ſet forth in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapters of <hi>Geneſis</hi> by their ſeveral Names, and drawn down from that Root to the filling and peopling of the whole Earth: <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. <hi>Theſe are the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Sons of</hi> Noah, <hi>after their Generations, in their Nations; and by theſe were the Nations divided in the Earth after the Flood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That after the Flood, in the time of <hi>Phaleg,</hi> the Languages of the World, eſpecially of the families of <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> were confounded, and the Nations proceeding from theſe Families diſperſed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Family of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was deduced through theſe enſuing Patriarchs, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>So that from the Flood to the Birth of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Deſcendents from <hi>Jacob</hi> grew into a great Nation, for in the 80<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of <hi>Moſes</hi> Life the Males of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were above 20 Years old, were above 600000, beſides the <hi>Levites,</hi> and beſides Women, and Children that were under 20 Years old, <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.32. and this great Increaſe of this People happened within the compaſs of about 260 Years. And thus, according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Account in the Holy Text, the Period between the Flood and the <hi>Exitus</hi> of the People out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was about 800 Years: But indeed the Account of the Septuagint, partly by the Interſection of <hi>Cainan</hi> in the Genealogy, and partly by adding 100 Years to that <hi>Techno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonia</hi> of the Patriarchs before <hi>Abraham,</hi> have made the Period larger by 884 Years. So that according to that Account, the <hi>Exitus ex Egypto</hi> was at leaſt 1684 Years after the Flood.</p>
               <p>Now this Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi> of the peopling of the World by the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Noah,</hi> doth theſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It gives us an Account of the Original of all the Nations in the World, not from bare alluſion of Names, nor from bare Coalitions into Civil Societies in which they were formed, as <hi>Romulus</hi> was the Founder
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64147:94"/>
of the <hi>Populus Romanus,</hi> and <hi>Pelaſgus</hi> of the <hi>Pelaſgi;</hi> but it gives us the Account of their Origination by Propagation from the Natural Roots and Parents of them. 2. Although notwithſtanding this Inſtance, it may be poſſible, that though the Natural Derivation of all Mankind was from <hi>Noah</hi> and his three Sons, yet the Progenitors or Anceſtors of <hi>Noah</hi> might have no Original, but might be Eternal, according to the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> yet when I find the ſame Author that gives me an Account of the Derivation of all the World from <hi>Noah</hi> and his three Sons, and that with moſt clear evidence and credibility, it gives me a very great Moral Evidence of the truth of his Relation touching the firſt Origination of Man by Creation: For doubtleſs both were derived to him by a conſtant Tradition from thoſe from whom he was deſcended, and it is not reaſonable to ſuſpect the truth of the one, ſince we have a ſtrong Moral Evidence for the truth of the other; namely, the General Flood, and the preſervation of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, and the derivation of all Mankind from him and his Sons: He that hath ſufficient reaſon to believe the Hiſtory touching the latter, will have little reaſon to doubt the truth of the Relation touching the Origination of Mankind; which as in it ſelf it ſeems reaſonable, and no other poſſible Suppoſition to compaſs it but by a Supernatural Production, ſo it hath a moſt excellent congruity with the ſubſequents of the Holy Hiſtory touching the Deſcendents from the firſt Man, the Flood, and the Re-peopling of the World from <hi>Noah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Moral Evidences of the credibility and truth of this Hiſtory are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Moſes</hi> that wrote it, had the beſt opportunity that could be to give a true Narrative of this Fact touching the Flood, and the Productions of Mankind by Generation from the Children of <hi>Noah:</hi> For, 1. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Writings of this Man that lie was a very Learned knowing Man, inquiſitive after all ſort of Learning; a Man in great Power and Eſteem in the Court of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and after that a great Governour of a very great People, which he governed with admirable Wiſdom; and by this means had opportunity to furniſh himſelf with all Monuments and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Antiquity that might be conducible to the Diſcovery of former things, and his Learning, Judgment and Ability to make an excellent uſe of theſe helps was alſo remarkable. Again, 2. He lived not far remote from the tranſaction of theſe things that he wrote, in compariſon of the Writers or Hiſtorians of after Ages: He dyed above 500 Years before <hi>Homer</hi> lived, which yet is the ancienteſt Hiſtorian that <hi>Greece</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, and he lived within the Period of 800 Years after the Flood and the diviſion of the World among the Poſterity of <hi>Noah. Livy</hi> and other Hiſtorians give us an account of the Affairs of <hi>Rome</hi> for above 600 Years before they were born, and many other Hiſtorians for a much longer time, and we give them credit; and certainly ſuch an Occurrence of ſuch remark as the Univerſal Flood and the Re-peopling of the World muſt needs be freſh in memory for ſuch a Period of about 800 Years; eſpecially conſidering that the Peopling of the World was a gradual and ſucceſſive buſineſs, that muſt needs preſerve its Memory even upon its own account, for it was ſtill current, and many were concerned in it in the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the laying the firſt Foundations of their States and Republicks. 3. As the Period or diſtance of time was not great, ſo if we conſider
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64147:95"/>
the longevity of Mens Lives in thoſe times, the Period was not much longer than three Generations, and ſo the Tradition of things might be preſerved freſh and certain unto the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> without any great difficulty: For <hi>Shem</hi> that was an Eye-witneſs of the Flood was contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with <hi>Abraham, Abraham</hi> was contemporary with <hi>Jacob, Cohath</hi> the Son of <hi>Levi</hi> was contemporary with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and with <hi>Amram</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Moſes</hi> and Son of <hi>Cohath:</hi> So that the Tradition of the Flood, and all that ſucceeded, might be handed from <hi>Shem</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Cohath,</hi> from him to <hi>Amram,</hi> and from him to <hi>Moſes.</hi> 4. Beſides all this, without any more Hands in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of it over, it appears that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob</hi> were great Men, had great Families and Wealth, were Men of great Note and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for their Learning and Knowledge, Men that had great Expectations, having a Promiſe of that Land to be given to their Poſterity; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they kept Sheep and Cattel according to the cuſtom of thoſe Eaſtern Countries, yet they were great Princes, and Men of excellent Education: doubtleſs <hi>Abraham</hi> inſtructed his Son in all the Knowledge that he had received by Tradition from his Anceſtors, the like did <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and after him <hi>Jacob.</hi> And therefore it might very reaſonably be thought that the Traditions of former things were kept freſh and pure in this Line of Men.</p>
               <p>And though we have no Writings extant ancienter than <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet probably in his time there might be Books, or at leaſt Monuments and Inſcriptions of things done before his time, which might preſerve the Memory of things paſt as well as our Books do now: For it is not to be doubted but Writing was much ancienter than <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of Writing as a thing in uſe in his time, <hi>Job</hi> 19.23, 24. and <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> tells us of certain Pillars erected by <hi>Seth,</hi> wherein the Monuments of Learning and Hiſtory were preſerved, <hi>Joſeph. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Antiquitat. cap.</hi> 2. and <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions Books written by others, either before or in his time.</p>
               <p>I very well know that <hi>Moſes</hi> had a greater means to know all thoſe things that to a <hi>Jew</hi> or a Chriſtian are of greater weight than all theſe; namely, the Infallible Conduct, Revelation and Inſpiration of the Divine Spirit: But the truth is, we are faln into an Age of many Chriſtians in Name and Profeſſion, that yet think it below them to believe upon that account without ſome farther Evidence that may ſatisfie their Reaſon; I have therefore ſubjoyned theſe and the following Conſiderations to make it appear, That upon the bare account of Moral Evidence more is to be ſaid for the truth of the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi> than may be ſaid for the truth of any other Hiſtory of things tranſacted before the life of the Hiſtoriographer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, we uſually allow ſuch an Hiſtorian to be worthy of belief, even in thoſe things whereof we have no other Evidence than the Credit of the Hiſtorian, if we find many things delivered by him to have ſo great an Evidence of Truth that they cannot well be doubted by any reaſonable Man. I will admit that <hi>Moſes</hi> delivers many things that were antecedent to him, and can have now no other Evidence than the Credit, Prudence, and Fidelity of the Hiſtorian himſelf; as touching the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of the Nations of the Earth from the ſeveral Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64147:95"/>
though poſſibly when he wrote there was a vigorous and authentical Tradition or other authentick Evidence of the Truth of them, which it may be is now ſo loſt that we have no other Evidence thereof but the bare Relation of <hi>Moſes</hi> (this I do for the preſent admit, though in the ſequel it will appear that there are other concurrent or collateral Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that aſſert and atteſt it) yet it is plain that the ſame <hi>Moſes</hi> writes many things that have ſo undoubted and ſo ſolid a Tradition aſſerting it, that no Man can doubt it that will not firſt deny his own Reaſon. As for inſtance, Can there be any doubt but that the Family of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were derived from <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the 12 Patriarchs; that they were brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Moſes;</hi> that they lived in the Wilderneſs forty Years, and were there miraculouſly fed by Quails and Manna, ſince this was written in that very Time and Age that could and would have contradicted it, if falſe? Can there be any doubt but the Hiſtory of his making the Ark and the Tabernacle were true, ſince both continued for many hundred Years after? Can there be any doubt of the Hiſtory of the Fiery Serpents, and the Cure of their Biting by the Brazen Serpent, which continued in the Wilderneſs until the time of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> which was many hundred Years after, with an unqueſtionable Tradition of the reaſon of its Making? Can there be any doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he divided the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in ſuch manner as is ſet down, in his life time, namely, to the two Tribes and a half on the farther ſide of <hi>Jordan;</hi> and his Preſcripts for the future dividing of the reſt, ſince it was enjoyed according to thoſe Preſcripts for many hundreds of Years after, and part of it until the coming of Chriſt? Can there be any doubt that he gave thoſe Laws Moral, Judicial and Ceremonial recorded by him, ſince thoſe very Laws have been for the ſpace of near two thouſand Years the very Rule and Model by which the Sacred and Civil Concerns of that People were always ruled and governed, and that in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the ſame Law that was given by the Hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo recorded in his Books of <hi>Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy?</hi> I ſay we have not greater Evidence that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Alfred, Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, or <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror; or that there were ſuch Laws of the Confeſſor, ſuch a Survey of <hi>England</hi> called <hi>Doomſday</hi> made by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, ſuch an Abbey founded by him in Memory of his Victory in <hi>Suſſex</hi> called <hi>Abbatia de Bello;</hi> ſuch Laws made by <hi>H.</hi> 1. as are tranſcribed in the Red Book of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> under that name; ſuch a Charter of King <hi>John</hi> made at <hi>Reningmead,</hi> or ſuch a Charter as <hi>Magna Charta</hi> made by King <hi>H.</hi> 3. than we have that there were ſuch Laws, ſuch Diſtributions of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſuch things done in <hi>Egypt</hi> and the Wilderneſs as are recorded by <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Moral Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that ariſeth from this Conſideration is this; That ſince in theſe things that are capable of an incomparable Evidence of Credibility in reſpect of the time wherein they were done (though very ancient, and exceeding the Age of any other Author) we find ſuch indiſputable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth, we have reaſon to give credit to the ſame Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Derivation and Beginning of Nations from the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> though in reſpect of the greater Antiquity thereof we have not any other concurrent Teſtimony but that of <hi>Moſes:</hi> And the rather, though we have not thoſe other Evidences thereof, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> might have as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64147:96"/>
unqueſtionable Evidences of the things tranſacted between his time and the Flood, which at the greateſt Account was not above 1600 Years, but by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Account about 800 Years before his time, as we now have of thoſe things which were tranſacted in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is above twice 1600 Years diſtant from our time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides the Relation of the Traduction of the ſeveral Nations of the World from the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> in that ſhort Pedigree or Extract, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. we have very many probable Evidences of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all ſucceeding Ages to that Genealogy of the World; as, 1. The common Tradition of thoſe Ages that ſucceeded ſhortly after <hi>Moſes,</hi> which commonly eſteemed them ſo deſcended: 2. The Analogy of their ſeveral Names of the Countries wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuppoſed the firſt Fathers fixed, as <hi>Canaan, Miſraim</hi> or <hi>Egypt, Chittim, Aſſur</hi> or <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and infinite more of this kind which are not needful here to be remembred, ſince <hi>Bochart</hi> and thoſe that have tranſcribed out of him give us abundant Inſtances. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it reaſonable to object againſt this that which is before obſerved in relation to other Alluſions of this kind, namely, That thoſe Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Places might not be ſo much from the Roots of thoſe Nations or Families, or from the Captains or Governors that gave Names to thoſe Countries they conquered; becauſe the Hiſtorian <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us in expreſs terms the reaſon of the Denomination to be from the very Parental Roots of thoſe People or Families: and 2. Becauſe thoſe Heads of Countries or Nations who were nearer to <hi>Moſes</hi> time gave the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to the Countries which in effect they peopled; as <hi>Edomites</hi> to the Poſterity of <hi>Edom, Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> to the Poſterity of the two Sons of <hi>Lot, Madian</hi> to the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Keturah,</hi> and many more: And we have as great reaſon to ſuppoſe that theſe grew and increaſed into great Nations in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſince the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who deſcended from a later Stock than any of theſe within the ſpace of little more than 200 Years, increaſed into ſo great a People, that in their going out of <hi>Egypt</hi> their Males of above 20 Years old amounted to 600000, whereof uſe will be made hereafter.</p>
               <p>The late Diſcovery of the vaſt Continent of <hi>America</hi> and Iſlands ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, which appears to be as populous with Men, and as well ſtored with Cattel almoſt as any part of <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> hath occaſioned ſome difficulty and diſpute touching the Traduction of all Mankind from the two common Parents ſuppoſed of all Mankind, namely <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> but principally concerning the ſtoring of the World with Men and Cattel from thoſe that the Sacred Hiſtory tells us were preſerved in the Ark. And the Objection runs thus:</p>
               <p>It ſeems apparent by all Geographical Deſcriptions of this lower World, that the whole Continent of <hi>America</hi> and the adjacent Iſles thereof are no way contiguous to any parts of <hi>Aſia, Europe,</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> but disjoyned from the ſame by huge and vaſt Oceans; divided from the Weſtern Coaſts of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> by the vaſt <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean; from the North parts of <hi>Europe</hi> by the great Frozen Seas lying between it and <hi>Greenland,</hi> which ſeems to be the Northern Coaſt of <hi>America;</hi> from the North-eaſt part of <hi>Aſia, Tartary</hi> and <hi>Cathay</hi> by the <hi>Fretum Anian;</hi> from the Eaſt parts of <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands by the <hi>Oceanus Pacificus</hi> of above 2000 Leagues breadth, and is divided from the great lately
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64147:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſcovered Iſland <hi>del Fogo</hi> by the Straits of <hi>Magellan,</hi> and that Iſland again divided from the uttermoſt Southern Continent (if any be) by a great Sea, which though not formerly known to the <hi>Europeans</hi> and <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> being divided from <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> by the great <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean, yet hath been lately diſcovered by <hi>Le Maire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is alſo evident that this vaſt Continent and the greateſt part of the Iſlands near adjacent to it are well ſtored with Men, and Beaſts of all ſorts: <hi>Laetius,</hi> in his Diſquiſition touching the Original of the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> in his 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Obſervation gives us an account of above thirty Millions of <hi>Americans</hi> deſtroyed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in thoſe Parts of <hi>America</hi> that they have uſurped to their own Dominion, which is not the hundredth part of that great Continent.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of this Continent as they greatly differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo they extremely differ from the <hi>Aſiaticks, Europeans</hi> and <hi>Africans</hi> in their Language and Cuſtoms, they recognize no Original from theſe Parts: it is true, they have ſome reſemblance of the <hi>Scythians</hi> or <hi>Tartars</hi> in ſome of their barbarous Cuſtoms, and ſome Words they have which ſeem to carry a congruity with Words of other Nations; But theſe are but ſlender Evidences to prove their Traduction from <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>Europe,</hi> eſpecially ſince no Monument is extant that gives an account of their Traduction or Migration thither; and the rather, becauſe it was a World wholly unknown to the <hi>Europeans, Africans</hi> and <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> till the Diſcovery thereof made by <hi>Americus Veſputius</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus</hi> which is but of late time.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Acoſta</hi> tells us in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Book, Cap.</hi> 36. there are divers perfect Animals of divers kinds in <hi>America</hi> which have none of the ſame kind in <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> as their Pacos, Guanacos, and <hi>Indian</hi> Sheep; and on the other ſide, many <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Birds and Beaſts in theſe Countries which are not found in <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon theſe Premiſſes they thus argue:</p>
               <p>That ſince by all Circumſtances it is apparent that <hi>America</hi> hath been very long inhabited, and poſſibly as long as any other Continent in the World, and ſince it is of all hands agreed that the ſuppoſed common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the reſt of Mankind, <hi>Adam, Noah</hi> and his three Sons, had their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations in ſome Parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſince we have no probable Evidence that any of their Deſcendents traduced the firſt Colonies of the <hi>American</hi> Plantations into <hi>America,</hi> being ſo divided from the reſt of the World, the acceſs thither ſo difficult, and Navigation the only means of ſuch a Migration being of a far later perfection than what could anſwer ſuch a Population of ſo great a Continent; That conſequently the <hi>Americans</hi> derive not their Original either from <hi>Adam,</hi> or at leaſt not from <hi>Noah;</hi> but either had an Eternal Succeſſion, or if they had a Beginning, they were <hi>Aborigines,</hi> and multiplied from other common Stocks than what the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Hiſtory imports.</p>
               <p>And although their Traditions in <hi>America</hi> be mingled with ſome things fabulous, yet they ſeem to favour this Concluſion. Some of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Creation of all things by God, and that He fixed certain Arrows in the ground, and from thence the Original of Mankind came. <hi>de Laet. de origine gent. Americanorum, Obſervat.</hi> 6. Many of them have a Tradition of a Flood, at leaſt in the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64147:97"/>
diſpeopled all the Countrey, and that out of the Lake <hi>Tilocaca</hi> the great God created at ſeveral places the common Parents of Mankind: <hi>ut videre est apud eundem, pag.</hi> 115, <hi>&amp;</hi> 105. or that certain Men leapt out of a Cave called <hi>Picare Campo,</hi> or <hi>Tampo,</hi> and were the firſt Parents of Mankind; and therefore they hold the <hi>Tambi</hi> the moſt ancient of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if we could ſuppoſe that either <hi>ex induſtria,</hi> or by accident ſome might paſs the Seas from <hi>Africa, Aſia</hi> or <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>America,</hi> yet it is not eaſily conceptible how Beaſts, eſpecially of prey, ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into <hi>America,</hi> through thoſe large Seas after the Deluge; neither is it poſſible to ſuppoſe that all the Beaſts of <hi>America,</hi> which are many of them wholly different in kind from thoſe of <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> ſhould be conducted over the Seas to be preſerved in the Ark, and after be tranſported again thither: and the improbability thereof is ſo much the greater, becauſe many of the perfect Animals found in <hi>America</hi> have none of the ſame kind in <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>è converſo,</hi> but are as it were appropriate to their proper Regions, though ſome there are that are common to <hi>America</hi> and the other Countries on this ſide. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either the Flood was not univerſal, or new Creations of Animals proper to <hi>America</hi> hapned there after the Flood.</p>
               <p>I anſwer to theſe difficulties: The Author of the Book called <hi>Praeadamitae</hi> hath ſet down certain Suppoſitions, which though they ſalve the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, yet they croſs the tenor of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Hiſtory, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Hiſtory of the Creation of Man doth not ſet down the Original of Mankind, but only the Original or common Parent of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation: that <hi>Adam</hi> was not the firſt Man that was created, but there were very many Ages of Men before him that peopled tho greater part of the World long before the Creation of <hi>Adam:</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, though <hi>Adam</hi> was the common Parent of the Inhabitants of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and many of the Countries adjacent, yet thoſe that peopled the far greater part of the World, eſpecially the Parts of <hi>America,</hi> were not deſcended from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Flood in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, though it drowned the Deſcendents from <hi>Adam</hi> and the Countries inhabited by them, namely, <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and ſome of the adjacent Countries, yet it was no Univerſal Deluge, but the far greater part of the World and the Inhabitants thereof were free from that Deluge; and conſequently that <hi>Noah</hi> and his three Sons were not the <hi>Capita familiarum</hi> of the whole Earth, but only of thoſe Families and Nations that were Inhabitants in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and ſome of the adjacent Countries; and conſequently that many of the Countries of <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and the entire Continent and Iſlands of <hi>America</hi> were not overwhelmed with this Deluge, though poſſibly they might have their particular Deluges, as hapned in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Theſſaly</hi> under <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Ogyges:</hi> and in favour of his Opinion alledgeth the long Computations of the <hi>Egyptians, Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Chineſes;</hi> the vaſt Armies of <hi>Ninus, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis, Zoroaſter</hi> and others, and the great extent of their Monarchies ſuddenly after the Flood; which could not, as he ſuppoſeth, be ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly propagated from <hi>Noah</hi> and his three Sons: But eſpecially inſiſts upon the greatneſs of the Continent of <hi>America</hi> and the Iſlands thereof, the populouſneſs and great ſtore of Men and Animals, which could not be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64147:97"/>
in any tolerable probability tranſported from Countries divided by ſuch great Seas from it.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe he inſiſts upon the Antiquity of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and upon that fond Reaſon of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſt in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus,</hi> That <hi>Egppt</hi> is the moſt ancient of the habitable World, becauſe neither ſubject to Total Inundations by reaſon it hath no Shoars, nor to Conflagration becauſe of the Inundation of <hi>Nilus:</hi> That conſequently <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and the Countries adjacent were only drowned, but the upper <hi>Aſia</hi> from whence the Dove fetched his Olive-branch was never thereby totally overwhelmed. This is the principal Subject of his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of what he calls his <hi>Syſtema Theologicum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there were no other fault in this Author, there is this one that renders him inexcuſable; In that he in all places of his Book pretends to own and maintain the Truth and Sacred Authority of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Hiſtory, and ſeems to maintain ſome of his Tenets by Scriptural Suffrage, and yet ſubſtitutes ſuch Aſſertions as any Man, and much more the Ingenious Author himſelf could not, cannot chooſe but ſee, that if they were true would neceſſarily not only weaken but overthrow the Authority and Infallibility of the Sacred Scriptures; at leaſt where it ſeems to croſs the Fabulous Traditions of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and <hi>Babylonian</hi> Antiquity, to which Fables he gives more credit than to the Holy Scriptures, and ſubmits the Authority of theſe to the Authority of thoſe: and while <hi>Judas</hi> like he ſeems to kiſs theſe Sacred Oracles, he perfidiouſly betrays their Authority, and draws their Truth as much as he can into ſuſpicion. Such a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had better become a plain profeſſed Infidel, and is ſo much the worſe, in that it is done ſlily, and by invidious Inſinuations, <hi>ſub Amici nomine:</hi> If he durſt have ſpoken out, he would have told us roundly and plainly that the Eleven firſt Chapters of <hi>Geneſis</hi> were but Fables; That <hi>Geneſis</hi> 3.20. where <hi>Eve</hi> is ſaid to be the Mother of all living; That <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.19, 20. where it is ſaid, that all the high Hills that were under the whole Heavens were covered; That <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.23. where it is ſaid, that every living ſubſtance was deſtroyed which was upon the face of the Ground, both Man and Cattel and Creeping things and the Fowls of the Heaven, and <hi>Noah</hi> only remained alive and thoſe that were with him in the Ark; That <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.32. where it is ſaid, that theſe were the Families of the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> after their Generations in their Nations, and by theſe were the Nations divided on the Earth after the Flood; are not to be believed, and are but meer Fictions: This had become a Man of his Principles; but he durſt not ſpeak out.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not in this place undertake a particular Anſwer of all that this Man hath ſaid; it is beſides my intention in this place to make ſo large an excurſion, and many others have done it to my hand: only I may ſay thus much, That a Man that gives ſo much cred it to the <hi>Egyptian, Caldean,</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> prodigious Traditions, in derogation of that very Scripture which this Man in Complement at leaſt ſeems to venerate, might have remembred, That the Tradition of the Univerſal Flood hath obtained in all places, even among the <hi>Americans</hi> themſelves, and that the Race of Mankind was thereby deſtroyed, except ſome few that were preſerved: That the moſt ſevere and obſerving Sect of the Philoſophers, namely the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> have conſtantly held viciſſitudes of Deſtructions of Mankind
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64147:98"/>
by ſucceſſive Deluges and Conflagrations, and a new Peopling of the World ſucceſſively by the Power of God; That <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates thoſe great Viciſſitudes, eſpecially of Deluges in thoſe Periodical great Winters which he ſuppoſeth to have hapned, and for the future to happen in this lower World. But of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>And although this Author in his 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book gives us a computation of a declivity of 600 Perches from the Fountain of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius</hi> until its fall into the <hi>Pontus Euxinus,</hi> and ſuppoſeth the higheſt Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> whereof <hi>Ararat</hi> where the Ark reſted was the higheſt, doth not exceed the perpendicular height of one Mile above the plain of the Earth; and therefore that an exceſs of 15 Cubits above <hi>Ararat</hi> would not reach the Head of <hi>Danubius,</hi> or at leaſt the upper Plains of the Upper <hi>Aſia;</hi> yet he might have remembred, That though it were admitted, that uſually the heights of moſt Mountains do not exceed a Mile in perpendicular height above their <hi>Baſis,</hi> yet many Mountains are ſituate in the more elevated parts of the Earth, and have the advantage thereby of the height of their <hi>Baſis:</hi> and poſſibly it will be found that the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Mountains of <hi>Armenia</hi> is ſituate in higher ground than the Fountain of <hi>Danubius</hi> or <hi>Euphrates.</hi> So that an exceſs of 15 Cubits above their height muſt in all probability cover the Plain of the Upper <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, he might have remembred that <hi>Egypt,</hi> that from the Authority of the Fable of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſt is favoured by him with an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from Inundation, lyes much lower than the Plains of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> yea than the Superficies of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> it ſelf: And therefore the Water (that naturally keeps its level, neither without a Miracle can loſe it) which overflowed the whole Continent of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> even to 15 Cubits above its higheſt Mountains, muſt of neceſſity overflow <hi>Egypt,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> by impregnable Evidences concludes to be one of the loweſt Countries in the World, and the very Production and Accretion of the Slime of <hi>Nilus;</hi> ſo that if the Flood covered <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> nothing but a Miracle could protect <hi>Egypt</hi> from it.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Diſſertation <hi>De Aetate Mundi, cap.</hi> 12. though he reprehend the <hi>Praeadamitae,</hi> and confutes the extravagancy of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet he ſeems to mince the Univerſality of the Flood: <hi>Nullum ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que relinquitur dubium, quin unum tantum fuerit diluvium, idque univerſale, cujus apud omnes penè gentes extat memoria: Verùm hîc minime probo eorum ſententiam qui totum terrae globum it a aquis tectum fuiſſe exiſtimant, ut nulla prorſus extaret ejus portio; ad hoc efficiendum multa debuiſſent concurrere mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula. Cum enim univerſae orbis aquae non ſufficiant ad obruendam tam altè terram, etiamſi omnia maria ſiccentur; debuiſſent vel plures aquae creari, vel dicendum cum aliquibus, iſtam aquarum molem ex aliis coeli orbibus decidiſſe, &amp; demum finito diluvio ad ſedes ſuas revolaſſe: Verùm hoc est piè nugari, Deus non facit miracula ſine cauſa: Quid opus erat mergere terras ubi nec olim fuere homines, ac ne nunc quidem ſunt? Stultum eſt putare ante diluvium adeò mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicatum fuiſſe genius hominum, ut omnes terrae angulos pervaſerit, &amp;c. Ut verò diluvii inundationem ultra orbis habitati termines producamus, nulla jubet ratio, imo prorſus abſurdum eſt dicere, ubi nulla hominum ſedes, illic etiam viguiſſe effectus poenae ſolis hominibus inflictae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed ſalves the neceſſity of drowning <hi>America</hi> and the greateſt

part of the New habitable World, when it extends the Flood no farther than there were Mankind inhabiting, and confines thoſe Habitations poſſibly within the Circle of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> And ſo all the Brutes that poſſibly in their firſt Creation were produced <hi>ſparſim</hi> through all the parts of the habitable World, as well in <hi>America</hi> as <hi>Aſia</hi> or <hi>Europe,</hi> were ſafe and untouched; and all thoſe Birds and Fowl that were within 40 or 50 Miles of the <hi>Circulus diluvii</hi> might eaſily preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by flight out of the extent of it; yea and the Brutes and Birds which were out of that ſuppoſed narrow extent of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia</hi> where the Flood prevailed, might eaſily refurniſh the ſame Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent after the ſubſiding of the Flood, without the wonderful and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult including of their kinds within the Ark for their preſervation, which if this Suppoſition hold, ſeems a needleſs Inſtitution and Miracle by the wiſe God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1. Therefore, I confeſs, I am no way ſatisfied with this Gratification of that Author to the <hi>Prae-Adamitae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For firſt, although I take this Flood to be ſomewhat more than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and a thing inſtituted by the Will of God, yet do I not eſteem it a thing purely Supernatural or Miraculous, neither do I ſuppoſe thoſe Waters created <hi>de novo,</hi> nor ſent out of the Orbs of Heaven to drown the Earth: I do not think the Face of the Earth and Waters were altogether the ſame before the Univerſal Deluge, and after; but poſſibly the Face of the Earth was more even than now it is, the Seas poſſibly more dilate and extended, and not ſo deep as now; the Waters poſſibly more than now, and in thoſe reſpects more capable of diffuſion over the, dry Land. For though there be many great variations in proceſs of time in the Sea and Land, yet it ſeems that <hi>ad plurimum</hi> the Seas grow deeper, and eat lower into the Earth, and conſequently more dry Land is daily acquired, and the Seas grow narrower and deeper.</p>
               <p>Now to deliver this Suppoſition of an Univerſal Deluge from thoſe difficulties, and that neceſſity of multiplication of Miracles, which that Author hath ſubſtituted, we are to conſider:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are not to make our eſtimate of the quantity of Waters meerly by the Superficies of the Sea, but by its vaſt depth, which in ſome places is unfathomable, and by thoſe vaſt ſubterraneous Receptacles of Water which pour themſelves out in ſeveral great Ebullitions and Marine Springs: Neither is it altogether improbable that the Waters of the Sea, naturally tending downward, and being of a fluid ſearching conſiſtency, might in proceſs of time have worked themſelves even almoſt to the Center of the Earth, and there reſiding in great and vaſt quantities, and poſſibly have in a manner undermined much of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Continent of the Earth: ſo that that which the Prophet ſpeaketh may be true literally, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.2. <hi>He hath founded it upon the Seas, and eſtabliſhed it upon the Floods:</hi> So that there are greater Store-houſes of Water than appear viſible to the World. If we could ſuppoſe that the incumbent Superficies of the Earth ſhould ſubſide and preſs upon thoſe Store-houſes of Water within its bowels, it might afford a competent ſtore to drown the Earth without a new Creation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, we may eaſily compute that the quantity or extenſion of the Body of the Air, even that which is commonly called the Atmoſphere, which at the loweſt account extends ſeven Miles in height, might by
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64147:99"/>
condenſation into Water afford a competent ſtore for the drowning of the World, and yet be again rarified into the ſame dimenſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence which before it obtained: for there is that vicinity of Nature between thoſe two Elements, that we daily ſee conſiderable proportions of the one by condenſation changed into the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we conſider thoſe immenſe Inundations that are Annually, and with ſome conſtant equality occaſioned by great Rains, as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> which by the Annual Rains in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> is raiſed almoſt every Year twenty Cubits, and overflows a conſiderable part of <hi>Egypt</hi> yearly between the Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> and the like Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations yearly hapning by Periodical Showers in the great River of <hi>America</hi> called <hi>Orenoque,</hi> between <hi>May</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> whereby it riſeth upright above 30 Foot; ſo that many of the Iſlands and Plains at other times inhabited, are 20 Foot yearly at that time under Water. And when we ſee that even the Ocean it ſelf in its daily Tides, eſpecially thoſe that happen about the <hi>Equinoxes,</hi> cauſed, as the <hi>Copernicans</hi> ſay, by the Interſections of the Annual and Diurnal Motions of the Earth; we need not have recourſe to a new Creation of Waters to perform this Office of the Divine Providence and Juſtice; He might by a ſtronger elevation of Vapours, or by an extraordinary motion of the Seas perform his purpoſe; which though probably it might not at the ſame time drown <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> yet by the ſucceſſive peragration of theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they might drown the whole Earth, as the Inundation of <hi>Nilus</hi> by the Showers of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> make the Flood there a Month ſooner than it happens in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Second Objection; I do confeſs it to be moſt true, that the Univerſal Deluge was a Judgment upon the Old World for their intolerable degeneration from their Duty to God: But I do not think that was the only Reaſon thereof; for the Infinite Power of God might have deſtroyed thoſe Evil Men by a Peſtilence as well as by a Flood, without detriment to the harmleſs Brutes or Birds: But as God Almighty is of Infinite Wiſdom, ſo it is the high Prerogative of that Wiſdom to have variety of Excellent Ends in the ſame Action. I do really think that this Univerſal Deluge was not only an act of his Vengeance upon Evil Men, but poſſibly an act of Goodneſs and Bounty to the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Inferior World, though the particulars thereof be hid from us. And if as ſome would have it, it ſhould be coextended only to the places that were then inhabited, and ſo the Flood particular, yet moſt certain it would be, even in ſuch a particular Flood, many great Spots of Ground would be neceſſarily drowned where never any Men were, or inhabited.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And it ſeems it is too haſtily concluded, That in the Period of 1656, or as the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> whom he follows, 2256 Years between the Creation and the Flood, that only <hi>Paleſtine, Syria</hi> or <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> were inhabited: For conſidering the longevity of Mens Lives in that Period, a ſmall skill in Arithmetical Calculation will render the Number of coexiſting Inhabitants of the Earth more than ſix times as many as would have hapned in 5000 Years, when Mens Ages were abridged to that ordinary dimenſion which now they have: and the ſtrait bounds of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> would not have held one fortieth part of the Inhabitants;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64147:99"/>
all <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> were not more than ſufficient for them: So that as the World grew full of Sin, ſo it grew full of Men and Beaſts, and ſtood in need of a Deluge to make room for its future Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>And this is as much as I ſhall ſay in this place, for the Vindication of the Poſſibility and Reaſonableneſs of the Univerſality of that Deluge recorded by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any ſhall doubt of the Capacity of the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> for the Reception of Brutes, Birds, and the Family of <hi>Noah,</hi> with the neceſſary Proviſions of Livelihood for them; let him but conſult Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis,</hi> and he will find that which may reaſonably ſatisfie him touching it.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall briefly conſider the Method and Means and Manner of the Peopling of <hi>America,</hi> and ſtoring that vaſt Countrey with Men and Beaſts and Birds, ſo far forth as we may reaſonably conjecture.</p>
               <p>And herein I muſt confeſs that I only make an Abſtract or brief Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of what hath been done to my hands by thoſe that had better Opportunities and Abilities to do it; as namely, <hi>Grotius, Laetius, Breer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Hornius, Joſephus Acoſta,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Webb, Martinius</hi> and others, who have profeſſedly written, <hi>De origine gentium Americanarum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, I ſhall conſider the Manner of Traduction of Men into <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Manner of Traduction of Brutes into <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the Traduction of Mankind into <hi>America,</hi> I do ſuppoſe theſe things following:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Origination of the common Parents of the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hapned in ſome part of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That though the Origination of the common Parents of Mankind were in <hi>Aſia,</hi> yet ſome of their Deſcendents did come into <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſuch Migration into <hi>America</hi> by the Deſcendents from <hi>Adam,</hi> was not only poſſibly, but fairly probable, notwithſtanding all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Difficulties.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Migrations of the Deſcendents of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> into <hi>America,</hi> was ſucceſſive, and interpolated.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That although we cannot certainly define the Time or Manner of all theſe Migrations, yet many of them were long ſince, or, as we may reaſonably conjecture, ſome Thouſands of Years ſince; but yet after the Univerſal Deluge.</p>
               <p>The Means of Tranſmigration of the Children or Deſcendents of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> from <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>America</hi> muſt be either by Land or by Sea, or by both; and if by Sea, then it muſt be deſigned, and <hi>ex propoſito,</hi> or caſually.</p>
               <p>I think it probable it may be all of theſe ways, but eſpecially by Sea.</p>
               <p>Touching the Tranſmigration by Land, it ſeems very difficult, becauſe though it may be poſſible that there may be ſome junctures between the North Continent of <hi>America</hi> and ſome part of <hi>Tartary, Ruſſia,</hi> or <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> yet none are known, unleſs the Frozen Seas in thoſe Parts might be a means to tranſport Men thither; which is difficult to ſuppoſe, thoſe Parts being unpaſſable by reaſon of the great Snows that happen ſo far Northward: though ſome have thought that <hi>Groenland</hi> is one Continent
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64147:100"/>
with <hi>America,</hi> and that in its fartheſt North-eaſt extent it is joyned to the Continent of <hi>Aſia</hi> about <hi>Japan</hi> or <hi>Cathay;</hi> ſo that a Land-paſſage might be out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Groenland,</hi> and thence into <hi>America.</hi> But this is only conjectured, and not fully diſcovered to be ſo.</p>
               <p>But however the Caſe now ſtands with the three known Parts of the World, in relation to its contiguity with the Continent of <hi>America;</hi> it is not impoſſible, but in that long tract of 4000 Years at leaſt, which hath hapned ſince the Univerſal Deluge, there hath been great alterations in the ſituations of the Sea and Earth: poſſibly there might be anciently Necks of Land that maintained paſſage and communication by Land between the two Continents. Many Inſtances of this kind are remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by <hi>Pliny,</hi> not only of the great <hi>Atlantick</hi> Iſland mentioned by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſt in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Timaeus,</hi> of a great bigneſs, almoſt contiguous to the Weſtern parts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> yet wholly ſwallowed up by that Ocean to which it hath given its Name of the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean; which if true, might for ought we know afford a Paſſage from <hi>Africa</hi> to <hi>America</hi> by Land before that Submerſion; but alſo many more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the like Variations: thus he reports that <hi>Sicily</hi> was anciently divided from <hi>Italy, Cyprus</hi> from <hi>Syria, Euboea</hi> from <hi>Boetia.

               <p n="1">1. Some Towns that were anciently Havens and Ports where Ships did ride, are now by exaggeration of Sand between thoſe Towns and the Sea, converted into firm Land 2, 3, 4 Miles diſtant from the Sea; ſuch was S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Dugdale ibid. p.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some great Continents and Tracts of Ground were anciently firm Land, and full of great Woods that could not have leſs time than 500 Years continuance, and yet were afterwards reduced again into the Dominion of the Ocean, and after all that re-reduced into firm Land; leaving the infallible Signatures of theſe ſeveral Changes, though the preciſe times thereof exceed the Memory of any Men alive; Inſtances whereof are as follow.</p>
               <p>In the great Level near <hi>Thorny,</hi> ſeveral Trees of Oak and Firr, ſome ſevered from their Roots, others joyned to their Roots which ſtand in firm Earth below the Moor, and in all probability have lain there hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Years, till covered by the inundation of the freſh and ſalt Waters, and the Silt and Mooriſh Earth exaggerated upon them: and the like monuments of great Trees buried in great quantities in the Iſle of <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm</hi> about 3 Foot, and ſome 5 Foot under ground, whereof there are multitudes; ſome Oaks of 5 Yards in compaſs, Firr-Trees of 30 Foot long. <hi>Vide Dugd. ubi ſupra, pag.</hi> 141, 171.</p>

                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:64147:101"/>But that one Inſtance is <hi>inſtar omnium,</hi> remembred by Mr. <hi>Dugdale, ubi ſupra, pag.</hi> 172, but of known and notorious truth; the Sceleton of a great Sea-fiſh above 20 Foot long found in the Downs or Uplands of <hi>Cammington</hi> in <hi>Huntingdonſhire,</hi> very far diſtant from the Sea; which is an unqueſtionable Evidence that the Sea was ſometime Maſter of that Tract of Ground.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Touching the <hi>Conchae marinae</hi> of ſeveral ſorts, it is moſt unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; I referr my ſelf herein to the Relation of Mr. <hi>Ray, ubi ſupra, pag.</hi> 114. <hi>&amp; ſeqq.</hi> wherein he gives us an account of theſe Petrified Shells found in great quantities within Continents at a vaſt diſtance from the Sea; and ſome Shells that are found in the Continent, which are ſtrangers in the Ports of the Sea conterminous to thoſe Continents.</p>
               <p>There are two Opinions concerning the Origination of theſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified Shells; 1. Of thoſe that have thought (and with great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) that theſe were left in thoſe places by the Sea, either by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Deluge, or that really the Sea did poſſeſs thoſe places where it left theſe Relicks and Memorials of it ſelf upon its receſs to a more ſetled Channel. And certainly if this be ſo, we muſt needs ſuppoſe anciently another Face of the Sea and Earth than what now is; poſſibly many of theſe Vallies and lower grounds might be entirely Sea, and the Hills and Mountains, and other Prominences of the Earth where theſe Petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Shells are often found, being the Shoars of that great Ocean in thoſe elder times, thoſe Shells were there caſt up, as they are at this day upon the Shoars.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Opinion is of thoſe that think that theſe <hi>Conchae</hi> or Petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Shells were no other than the <hi>Luſus naturae,</hi> the Effects of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick power of the Earth; 1. Becauſe they are found at ſuch great diſtances from the Sea: 2. Becauſe they are many times of ſuch a kind of Fabrick as are not to be found in thoſe parts of the Sea that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminous to thoſe Continents where they are found; ſome are found in the middle of <hi>Germany,</hi> 200 Miles diſtant from the Sea at the neareſt; Scallop-ſhells are found in the Ditches of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and yet they are rarely to be gotten on the Sea or Sea-ſhoar nearer than <hi>Gallicia</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Shells are ordinarily filled with Stone ſuitable to the Stone of thoſe places where they are found. Theſe and the like Reaſons, though not evidently concludent againſt the former Suppoſition, yet have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many Learned Men to attribute theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> to the Plaſtick power of the Earth.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I have ſeen ſuch apparent Evidences in and near the place where I live of things of this nature, that I am ſatisfied that many of them are but the Relicks of Fiſh-ſhells left by the Sea, and there in length of time actually Petrified; and the Inſtance of the great Fiſh-ſceleton found at <hi>Cammington</hi> ſeems an undeniable Evidence thereof. And I remember in my youth, in the Liſne of a Rock at <hi>Kingſcote</hi> in <hi>Gloceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> I found at leaſt a Buſhel of Petrified Cockles actually diſtinct one from another, each near as big as my Fiſt: and at <hi>Adderly,</hi> mentioned by Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> about 40 or 50 Years ſince thoſe Configurations of great Shells in Stones were frequently found, and for their curioſity, as many as could be found were taken up by ſeveral perſons and carried away; ſince which time, for above 20 Years laſt paſt, there are none, or very
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64147:101"/>
few found; which nevertheleſs if they had been the Product of the Plaſtick power of the Earth, would have been Annually re-produced.</p>
               <p>And yet I do think that all theſe Petrifications are not always neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily the Monuments of the Sea poſſeſſing thoſe places as its conſtant or uſual Seat, but that many of thoſe Shells ariſe <hi>de novo,</hi> not barely from the Plaſtick power of the Earth (as ſome Inſects and Vegetables ariſe ſpontaneouſly) but from certain Seminal Ferments brought thither, which are as it were the <hi>Seminium,</hi> of their production. And theſe Seminal Ferments were firſt in the Sea and Sea-Waters, and might by many means by brought into thoſe new parts of firm Land, 1. By the Univerſal Deluge; 2. By the various mutable ſtations of the Land, and fluxes of the Sea; 3. By elevation of thoſe Seminal Ferments from the Sea or ſome deſiccated places thereof, by the heat of the Sun, and diſcharging them by Rain upon ſeveral parts of the dry Land, and where poſſibly thoſe Seminal Ferments might be digeſted and ripened gradually into theſe Configurations. But touching theſe kinds of Seminal Ferments, and their Energy, more will be ſaid hereafter.</p>
               <p>By this digreſſion I mean but thus much, namely, That we can by no means reaſonably ſuppoſe the Face, Figure, Poſition and Diſpoſition of the Sea and dry Land to be the ſame anciently as now, but there might then be Sea where there is now dry Land, and dry Land where there is now Sea; and that there might have been in former times Necks of Land, whereby communication between the parts of the Earth, and mutual paſſage and re-paſſage for Men and Animals might have been, which in long proceſs of time within a Period of 4000 Years may have been ſince altered: That thoſe parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>America</hi> which are now dis-joyned by the interluency of the Sea, might have been formerly in ſome Age of the World contiguous to each other; and thoſe Spots of Ground, namely, the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, and others that are now crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into ſmall Iſlands, might anciently have been one entire Continent. And if in places that have been long inhabited, and obſerved by Men, theſe mutations have happened as are apparent to our very Senſes, yet the preciſe Times, Manner and Circumſtances thereof are wholly loſt to us, as in divers parts of <hi>Europe</hi> is apparent: much more the like Changes may happen in thoſe remote and vaſt Marine Tracts which have been long unknown and unobſerved, and ſcarce poſſible to be obſerved by Mankind, as in the <hi>Scythian, Atlantick, Pacifick,</hi> and other Northern and Southern parts of the Seas.</p>
               <p>Touching the Second Means, namely, the Paſſage by Sea; It ſeems very probable that the greateſt and readieſt means of the migration of Colonies or Plantations into the Weſtern World from the Eaſtern, was by Sea, and the help of Navigation; whereof much might be caſual, by Tempeſts or contrary Winds, but ſome and the more principal might be, <hi>ex inſtituto &amp; induſtria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Navigation, and the uſe of Ships is of that great Antiquity, that it is difficult to aſſign when it began to be in uſe.</p>
               <p>It ſeems probable that it was not unknown to the Old World before the Flood, and yet not in that perfection that it was after, their Veſſels being not reduced to that perfection as to endure a wide Sea, ſuch as the Univerſal Deluge was, neither were they probably fitted with ſuch Stores
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64147:102"/>
as might be requiſite for ſo long and unexpected a Navigation as the Flood laſted.</p>
               <p>But the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> was certainly a moſt exact piece of Architecture, and might give a Pattern or Inſtruction for Veſſels of great burthen, and very probably ſince that time the skill of Making and Navigating of Ships was much ripened and improved.</p>
               <p>If we conſult the Heatheniſh Hiſtories, we ſhall find Navigation very ancient among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> but eſpecially among the <hi>Phenicians, Tyrians,</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polydore Virgil, de Inventione Rerum, l.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. and before him, <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Natural Hiſtory, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 57. gives us an Account of the ſeveral Inventors of the various forms and appendants of Shipping and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but yet the thing it ſelf they carry up to higher Memorials; the Navigation of the <hi>Argonauts</hi> to <hi>Colchis</hi> for the Golden Fleece, being one of the famous <hi>Epochae</hi> of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Computation, happened in about the 1100 Year after the Flood according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Account; and above 200 Years before them <hi>Danaus</hi> ſailed out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> Shipping being there in uſe long before.</p>
               <p>That although we find not expreſs mention of the <hi>Pyxis Nautica</hi> or Magnet for many Years after mention of the Uſe of Navigation, yet the ſame Author tells us that the <hi>Phenicians</hi> ſteered their Courſe by the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Stars.</p>
               <p>But we have a better and ancienter Account of the uſe and frequency and antiquity of Navigation in the Sacred Scriptures: <hi>Jacob</hi> died about 600 Years after the Flood, mentions Ships and Havens for Shipping as things well known, and particularly <hi>Zidon,</hi> as a great Port of Shipping, where <hi>Zebulon</hi>'s Lot was to be caſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.13. <hi>Balaam</hi> alſo in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions the Ships of <hi>Chettim</hi> or <hi>Greece</hi> as a known thing, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.24. again, in the Reign of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians</hi> are taken notice of to be expert Sea-men; that <hi>Solomon</hi> had a Navy upon the Coaſt of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> that from thence he with the <hi>Tyrians</hi> made long and great Voyages to <hi>Ophir</hi> and <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> (places, as it ſeems moſt probably, in the Eaſt <hi>India,</hi> not in <hi>Africa</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> as ſome have thought) and thence brought Gold and other Commodities once in three Years. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.18.9.21.</p>
               <p>And how ſedulous and induſtrious all Maritim Coaſts were in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of Navigation, in multiplying of Shipping, in Merchandizing and Trading, in ſearching out and ſubduing Forein Countries, when either they were afflicted at home by War, or grew over-populous, the Hiſtories of all ſucceeding Ages of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> of the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Phenicians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> of the <hi>Seres</hi> or <hi>Chineſes;</hi> and in later times, of the <hi>Venetians, Sicilians, Rhodians, Spaniſh, Dutch, French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> give us a large Account.</p>
               <p>And therefore as later Years, have given us of this Age witneſs, of the Tranſplantations to <hi>America</hi> from <hi>Spain, France, Portugal, England, Scotland, Holland,</hi> and ſome Ages before that have given Inſtances of Tranſplantations from <hi>Norway</hi> into <hi>Groenland</hi> and <hi>Iceland;</hi> ſo it ſeems not only poſſible, but very probable, that either by Caſualty and Tempeſt, or by Intention and Deſign, either out of lucre of Gold, or for disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of the Countries ſurcharged with multitude of Inhabitants, or by greatneſs of Mind, affecting Noble Undertakings, or by reaſon of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64147:102"/>
Hardſhip, Oppreſſion and Wars at home, or by ſome or all of theſe ways, ſeveral parts of this great Continent at ſeveral times have been planted with Inhabitants, which in proceſs of time have multiplied into thoſe many Nations, and have forgotten their Original, and the Manners, Religion or Cuſtoms of thoſe People from whom they were derived in <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> or <hi>Africa.</hi> And ſurely we have reaſon to believe that we of this Iſland are not <hi>Aborigines,</hi> but came hither by Migrations, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or Plantations from other parts of the World; yet were it not for the help of Hiſtorical Monuments, we ſhould have forgotten who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited this Iſland ſix or ſeven hundred Years ago: yea, and notwithſtanding all theſe Hiſtorical helps, we have no Authentick Tradition that can give us any tolerable Account before the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> much leſs of the firſt Plantation of this Iſland: for as to the Story of <hi>Brute</hi> and his Company, we have but little evidence of the truth of it, and if it were never ſo true, yet it doth not prove it uninhabited before.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe Countries in <hi>Aſia</hi> or <hi>Europe</hi> that with greateſt probability firſt peopled <hi>America,</hi> ſeem to be 1. The <hi>Britiſh;</hi> 2. The <hi>Norwegians;</hi> 3. The <hi>Tartars</hi> or <hi>Scythians;</hi> 4. The <hi>Phenicians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> 5. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> or <hi>Seri.</hi> I do not at all mention the late Migrations of the <hi>Spaniſh, French, Portugals, Dutch, Engliſh,</hi> or <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> but thoſe of a more ancient Edition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Migration, recorded by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Powel, ſub anno</hi> 1170, who tells us, That <hi>Madoc</hi> one of the Sons of <hi>Owen Gwenith</hi> went over twice into the Northern Coaſts of <hi>America,</hi> and made there a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantation, who though in proceſs of time much degenerated from their Nature, Language, Cuſtoms and Religion, yet retained ſome Monuments of all.

               <p n="2">2.

And laſtly, much of the Origination of the <hi>Americans</hi> ſeems to be attributable to the Migrations of the <hi>Seri</hi> or <hi>Sinenſes</hi> from the Eaſtern parts of <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, from the Iſlands of <hi>Borneo,</hi> and the <hi>Molucca</hi>'s, and <hi>Japan,</hi> through the <hi>Marc Pacificum</hi> into the Weſtern part of the Continent of <hi>America;</hi> which though it be a large Ocean of above 2000 Leagues, between the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi> Iſlands and the Weſt of the <hi>American</hi> Continent, and the paſſage thither difficult in reſpect of conſtant Eaſterly Winds between the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks; yet many Reaſons ſeem to induce a likelihood of Plantations from thence, 1. In reſpect of the Antiquity of the Peopling of <hi>China,</hi> which if we believe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Webb</hi> was the firſt peopled after the Univerſal Deluge; that the Ark there firſt reſted upon that tract of Mountains that environ a great part of <hi>China;</hi> that <hi>Sem</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah</hi> firſt ſetled there; that it is the moſt Ancient and Primitive Language; that by means of the Antiquity and Setledneſs of this Monarchy, having continued in its entireneſs ever ſince the Univerſal Deluge, it is moſt probable that the Weſtern Continent was peopled from thence. 2. Becauſe they were the greateſt Maſters of Shipping, and beſt skilled in Navigation of any part of the World; that the <hi>Pixis Nautica</hi> was there known and uſed long before the knowledge thereof in <hi>Europe.</hi> 3. The many Iſlands on the South-eaſt and South part of <hi>China,</hi> as <hi>Borneo, Java, Gilolo, Celebes</hi> and others near the Equator are dis-joyned but by very narrow Seas, not much broader than thoſe between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> from the Neck of Land called <hi>Terra des Papos</hi> or <hi>Nova Guinea;</hi> and <hi>Nova Hollandia,</hi> which is now diſcovered to be at leaſt in ſome parts disjoyned from the more Southern Continent by a great Sea, but thought to have been anciently part of the Southern Continent, and poſſibly ſo it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſome parts thereof.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe and the like probabilities it may ſeem reaſonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, 1. That the <hi>Americans</hi> had their Original from the Inhabitants of <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> that tranſmigrated into that Continent either intentionally, or caſually, or both. 2. That thoſe Migrations were not of any one ſingle Nation or People, but from many or divers Nations. 3. That theſe Migrations were not altogether, or at one time, but ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively in ſeveral Ages; ſome earlier, ſome later. 4. That therefore it is impoſſible to determin the Time or firſt <hi>Epocha</hi> of ſuch Migrations, but only that they were all ſince the Univerſal Deluge, which is now above 4000 Years ſince: Some Migrations might be within two, three, or four hundred Years after the Flood, ſome later, according to various Accidents; but it is no way probable that the earlieſt Migration thither was leſs diſtant than 1000 Years from this time. 5. That if we ſhould admit that the firſt Migration thither were above 2000 Years ſince, of an hundred Pairs they might eaſily propagate a number competent enough to people all that vaſt Continent. 6. That it ſeems that ſince the laſt of theſe ancient Migrations, ſuppoſe that of <hi>Madoc</hi> and his
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64147:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Britons,</hi> until our late Migrations by the <hi>Spaniards, French, Engliſh, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Scotc<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> there probably interceded an interval of at leaſt four or five hundred Years, in all which interval the Commerce and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation between <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> hath as it were ſlept, and been forgotten both by them and us. 7. That in that interval of 500 Years or thereabouts in all Parts, but in ſome Parts far greater, there muſt in all probability happen a great forgetfulneſs of their Original, a great degeneration from the Primitive Civility, Religion and Cuſtoms of thoſe places from whence they were firſt derived; a ferine and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous kind of Life, a converſation with thoſe that having been long there were faln into a more barbarous habit of Life and Manners, would eaſily aſſimilate at leaſt the next Generation to Barbariſm and Ferineneſs. It is true, where a Colony comes and keeps it ſelf in a Body, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies anciently, and our Plantations in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New England</hi> do, and the new Acceſſions incorporate and joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto that Body, Cuſtoms both Religious and Civil, and the Original Language are long kept entire: But where the Acceſſions are but thin and ſparing, and ſcattered among the Natives of the Country where they come, and are driven to conform themſelves unto their Cuſtoms for their very ſubſiſtence, ſafety and entertainment, it falls out that the very firſt Planters do ſoon degenerate in their Habits, Cuſtoms and Religion; as a little Wine poured into a great veſſel of Water loſeth it ſelf: But if they eſcape a total Aſſimulation to the Country where they thus are mingled, yet the next Generation in ſuch a mixture is quickly aſſimulated to the corrupt Manners and Cuſtoms of the People among whom they are thus planted: So that it is no wonder, if in ſuch kind of ſmall Acceſſions ſucceſſively from one and the ſame or ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries, the third Generation forget their Anceſtors, and the Cuſtoms, Religion and Languages of thoſe People from whom they were firſt derived, and aſſume various temperaments in their Language and Cuſtoms, according as the places of their Habitation and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany among whom they live, obtain. And if any man conſider but the ſtrange contemperation and production of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language out of the combinations and mixtures of the <hi>Daniſh, Saxon, Britiſh, French, Dutch,</hi> and other Countries, he may eaſily perſwade himſelf, that out of the Mixtures of People there may ariſe as great diverſities of Language, Rites and Cuſtoms, as there may Temperaments of Qualities by the various combinations and mixtures of the prime Qualities, or varieties of Words by the various appoſitions of the 24 Letters in the Alphabet: and even theſe Cuſtoms and Languages ſubject to infinite ſucceſſive alterations and variations, according to the variety of Forein Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Commerce, Victories, Wars, Credit and Opinion of Factions or Parties.</p>
               <p>And thus far touching the Peopling of <hi>America</hi> with Mankind; I ſhall ſubjoyn ſomething touching the ſtoring of it with Brutes and Birds.</p>
               <p>It ſeems in the original Creation of things that Vegetables and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, eſpecially thoſe that by their nature may <hi>ſponte oriri,</hi> or by equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal Generation, had as large and univerſal production as the habitable parts of the Earth or dry Land; as Fiſhes, for the moſt part, had their
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64147:104"/>
firſt created production as univerſal and <hi>ſparſim,</hi> in the whole extent of the Seas or Waters.</p>
               <p>But whether the primitive production of the more perfect Animals both Brutes and Birds, that have ever ſince had their production by univocal Generation, were diffuſively created over the habitable or dry Ground as Vegetables were; or whether there were only certain <hi>Capita ſpecierum perfectarum utriuſque ſexus,</hi> created in a certain determinate <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictus</hi> near to the place of the firſt Origination of Mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> in or near the Garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> and that the whole Progeny of ſuch Brutes and Birds were propagated after ſucceſſively through the whole World from theſe <hi>Capita ſpecierum,</hi> ſeems an Inquiry of more difficulty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin.</p>
               <p>Some Obſervations ſeem to favour the former Conjecture, eſpecially conſidering that many <hi>Species</hi> of Brutes and Birds are as it were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to their ſeveral Countries, as Elephants, Camels, Lions, and divers other Brutes; Parrots, Oſtriches, and other Fowls which are not found in other Countries.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially the ſame Opinion is inferred from the Beaſts and Birds which are found in <hi>America,</hi> which have not the like in the other parts of the World: <hi>Acoſta</hi> in his 36<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book ſaith, that beſides the Beaſts called <hi>Guanaco's</hi> and <hi>Paco's,</hi> there be a thouſand different kinds of Birds and Beaſts of Foreſt in <hi>America</hi> which have never been known neither in ſhape nor name in other parts of the World; whereof no mention is made, nor names given in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> or other Eaſtern Language of the World.</p>
               <p>And in his 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of that Book he tells us, That though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their firſt Plantation found certain Beaſts, Birds, and other things in <hi>America</hi> common to thoſe of <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> yet ſome Beaſts and other things they brought thither which were unknown there, and for which they had no Names but what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought along with them. So that one of the beſt Indications which they had to know thoſe Beaſts which were originally brought with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Europe</hi> in their firſt Plantation, was, in that the <hi>Indians</hi> had no other Names for ſuch but <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Names.</p>
               <p>And again, ſince <hi>America,</hi> as is generally ſuppoſed, is divided on every ſide from <hi>Aſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> by conſiderable Seas, and no known paſſage by Land, ſo that all the poſſibility there could be for traduction of the Brutes into <hi>America</hi> from the known World, could only be by Shipping: Though this might be, and certainly was a method uſed for the traduction of uſeful Cattel from hence thither, yet it is not credible that Bears, Lions, Tigers, Wolves, and Foxes ſhould have ſo much care uſed for their tranſportation.</p>
               <p>And upon the ſame account they ſeem to inferr, That the Beaſts and Birds preſerved by <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark could only be ſuch as were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to <hi>Aſia,</hi> but not thoſe that were of the <hi>American</hi> kinds, for how ſhould they come from thence to the Ark? Or if it be ſuppoſable that they could be brought thither, why did none of the kinds which are found commonly in <hi>America</hi> leave ſome of their Kind or Race here?</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, it hath been the more received Opinion, That the <hi>Capita ſpecierum perfectarum</hi> of perfect Terreſtrial Animals and Birds
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64147:104"/>
were created near unto the place of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Creation, and that from theſe, and theſe only the Race of perfect Animals, Birds, and Brutes were propagated and traduced over the face of the whole Earth; and that the <hi>American</hi> Brood was traduced from theſe, and from thoſe Couples of theſe that were preſerved by <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark: And that upon theſe Inſtances, whereof ſome are of Divine authority, others are Phyſical.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the Beaſts and Fowls were brought to <hi>Adam</hi> to give them their Names, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19, 20. which could not have been, if the ſeveral kinds of them in their firſt Creation had not been within ſome reaſonable and approachable diſtance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the Beaſts and Birds had their kinds preſerved in the Ark, and the reſt were drowned by the Univerſal Deluge. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.23.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Although the Continent of <hi>America</hi> was in the firſt <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations thereof ſtored with wild Beaſts, as Lions, Tigers, Bears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet thoſe Iſlands that were remote from the Land, though large and fruitful, had not any of theſe Beaſts then in them, as <hi>Cuba, Hiſpaniola, Jamaica, Margarita:</hi> this is verified by <hi>Acoſta,</hi> upon a ſtrict examination, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 21. <hi>&amp; alibi,</hi> and the ſame hath been found true in other new diſcovered Iſlands by other Navigations: Whereby it appears that the Brutes were not <hi>Aborigines,</hi> for then they ſhould have been found in thoſe Iſlands as well as in the Continent, as well as Inſects and Vegetables; and that therefore in the Continent it ſelf, the firſt ſtoring thereof was not from it ſelf, but by ſome means of acceſſion from other Parts, for otherwiſe they might have been found as well there as in the Continent.</p>
               <p>The two great Obſtacles are, 1. The difference of the Brutes and Birds of that Continent from thoſe of <hi>Aſia, Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa:</hi> 2. The difficulty of finding a commodious paſſage from <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>Europe</hi> for ſuch Beaſts and Birds from hence thither, admit they were all of the ſame kind. And touching both theſe I ſhall ſay ſomething.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the diverſity of Brutes and Birds of this and the Weſtern World; the difficulty from thence is but ſmall, for there are divers Accidents even in the Eaſtern World, <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> that afford us Inſtances of that kind, though, excepting ſome Iſlands, it be one common Continent: I ſhall inſtance only in ſome Accidents of this kind: 1. This Variation may happen by Mixtures of ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> in Generation, which gives an anomalous Production, as we ſee ordinarily by the mixture of Pheaſants and Hens, Chickens are produced partaking of both in colour and figure, which yet renders them different from both: And it is obſerved by many that the Cauſe of that great variety of Brutes in <hi>Africa</hi> is by reaſon of the meeting together of Brutes of ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> at Waters (which in thoſe dry Countries are ſcarce) and the promiſcuous couplings of Males and Females of ſeveral <hi>Species,</hi> whereby there ariſe a ſort of Brutes that were not in the firſt Creation. This was long ſince obſerved by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſo that it grew a Proverb alſo, <hi>Semper aliquid novi Africa affert. De generat. Animal. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. and ſo continues to this day. 2. The Percolation, as I may call it, of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles by Proſemination will alter their Nature, Colour and Shape, as Tulips, or Carnations riſing from Seed will differ in Colour from what thoſe were that yielded thoſe Seeds. 3. Culture will improve Wild Flowers in bigneſs and beauty; and want of Culture will ſometimes
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64147:105"/>
make Vegetables degenerate. See for theſe Tranſmutations Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century of his Natural Hiſtory. I have often obſerved, that River-Fiſh, as Trouts and Flounders, and others, will alter their figure, ſome for the better and ſome for the worſe, being put into Ponds. Again in Animals; the Learned Doctor <hi>Harvey</hi> in the end of his laſt Book <hi>de Generatione Animalium,</hi> delivers an Opinion which at the firſt view ſeems wonderful ſtrange, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Conformation of the <hi>Proles,</hi> both in Men and Brutes, to their ſeveral ſpecifical Shapes and Configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, is by a certain ſpecifical operative <hi>Idea</hi> in the Phantaſie or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of Animals, fixed and radicated in them, and conformable to their ſeveral <hi>Species;</hi> and that monſtrous or anomalous Productions are by ſome diſturbance or diſcompoſure of that ſpecifical <hi>Idea,</hi> by ſome other inordinate <hi>Idea.</hi> And conformable hereunto ſeems the Opinion of <hi>Marcus Marci,</hi> in his learned Book <hi>de Ideis formatricibus.</hi> Whatever the truth of this Opinion be, it is not here properly examinable; yet it ſeems beyond queſtion, that as to ſome external Signatures, as Colour, Shape, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Phantaſie or Imagination of the Females as well Animals as of Mankind, eſpecially <hi>in momento conceptus</hi> and for ſome time after, hath a great Influence: Some there are that think that <hi>Jacob</hi>'s change of the colour of Sheep and Goats by peeled Rods, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.37. was partly at leaſt upon a Phyſical account; and he that reads <hi>Fienus de Viribus Imaginationis,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> in the latter end of his Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, will find ſuch Changes by the ſtrength of Imagination as are very remarkable. It is probable, that in the great plenty of Birds and Fowls in uninhabited Woods of the Weſtern World, even the ſeveral aſpects of their Figure and Colour in their ſeaſons of Copulation may make various Configurations and Colours in their Broods. 5. But that which is more to my purpoſe, and of greater evidence, is this; Variety of Soils and Climates makes admirable and almoſt ſpecifical Variations even of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> of Vegetables, Animals and Men: In Vegetables, a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soil or Climate improves in Beauty, Bigneſs and Virtue; a barren Soil or Climate impairs them: among Animals, the <hi>Indian</hi> Elephants are larger than the <hi>African;</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſtiff degenerates in his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and fierceneſs, at leaſt in the firſt ſucceſſion by generation, when brought into <hi>France;</hi> the <hi>Barbary</hi> Horſe is of a finer Spirit and Make than the <hi>Flanders</hi> Horſe, yet degenerates in a great meaſure in the firſt or ſecond generation, when removed from <hi>Barbary.</hi> Nay let us look upon Men in ſeveral Climates, though in the ſame Continent, we ſhall ſee a ſtrange variety among them in Colour, Figure, Stature, Complexion, Humor; and all ariſing from the difference of the Climate, though the Continent be but one, as to point of Acceſs and mutual Intercourſe and poſſibility of Intermigrations: The <hi>Ethiopian</hi> black, flat-noſed and criſp-haired; the <hi>Moors</hi> tawny; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſwarthy, little, haughty, deliberate; the <hi>French</hi> ſpritely, ſudden; the Northern people large, fair-complexioned, ſtrong, ſinewy, couragious: nay we may ſee in more conterminous Climates, even in thoſe of ours, great variety in the People thereof; the Up-lands in <hi>England</hi> yield ſtrong, ſinewy, hardy Men; the Marſh-lands, eſpecially about <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> Men of large and high ſtature; the <hi>Welſh</hi> that inhabit the Mountains, commonly ſharp-viſaged. And there is no leſs difference in the Humors and Diſpoſitions of People inhabiting ſeveral
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64147:105"/>
Climates, than there is in their Statures and Complexions. And it is an evidence that this ariſeth from the Climate, becauſe long continuance in theſe various Climates aſſimilate thoſe that are of a Forein extraction to the Complexions and Conſtitutions of the Natives after the ſucceſſion of a few Generations.</p>
               <p>And upon this account there may be great variety in the Colour, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and Make of divers Birds and Animals in <hi>America</hi> from thoſe in the Eaſtern World, and yet both have the ſame original extraction; for there is no leſs variety in the Brutes and Birds of <hi>Africa</hi> from thoſe of <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>Aſia,</hi> and yet nothing impedes their mutual commigrations, being the ſame Continent, though differing Climates.</p>
               <p>And therefore although <hi>Acoſta</hi> and others tell us of Brutes and Birds in <hi>America</hi> that are not found in <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>Aſia,</hi> it doth not at all enervate the Sacred Hiſtory; it is poſſible there may be the like in <hi>Africa,</hi> or ſome Parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> which yet <hi>Acoſta</hi> never travelled. 2. But if not, they might ariſe by an anomalous Mixture of <hi>Species.</hi> 3. Poſſibly they may be of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> with the Primitives, but received ſome accidental Variations in proceſs of time; as the various kinds of Dogs here in <hi>England,</hi> Maſtiffs, Spaniels, Hounds, Greyhounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might in their Primitives be of one <hi>Species;</hi> the like may be ſaid of various kinds of Apes, Baboons, Monkies; of Elks, Buffalo's, and Cows; the like of ſeveral ſorts of Parrots, which primitively might be but one <hi>Species,</hi> and receive accidental Variations in proceſs of generations, by ſome of the means above mentioned: and thus Crows, Daws, Rooks might be but a baſtard kind of Raven; the <hi>Royſton</hi> Crow and the <hi>Corniſh</hi> Daw, though they have accidental differences from thoſe among us, ſeem yet to be of the ſame kind with ours; and ſo poſſibly might the Sheep of <hi>Peru,</hi> called by <hi>Acoſta Pacos</hi> and <hi>Guanacos,</hi> be primitively Sheep, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced by their long abode in ſucceſſive generations in <hi>Peru;</hi> the <hi>Auza's</hi> and <hi>Poulaſſes</hi> mentioned by <hi>Acoſta, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. may be but a <hi>Species</hi> of Ravens, though by the Climate accidentally altered in bigneſs and ſhape.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I mention, that it may appear, That even in the ſame Continent, wherein a mutual tranſition may be without difficulty, yet the very Climate may as it were appropriate ſome Brutes to certain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which yet might without any great difficulty be at firſt Creation of them contained within nearer bounds, and might upon the occaſion of the Common Deluge be drawn together into the Ark, and afterwards by their wandring farther, and inuring themſelves to a certain Continent or part thereof, be accidentally changed, and as it were appropriate to it: And alſo to ſhew, That Animals even of the ſame Original, Extraction and <hi>Species,</hi> be diverſified by accuſtomable reſidence in one Climate, from what they are in another. Therefore poſſibly as little Conſequence may be drawn againſt the common Original of the <hi>Capita ſpecierum Animalium</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> as may be drawn from the diverſity of ſome kind of Animals inhabiting in divers parts of <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is one common Continent. I do therefore conclude, That the variety of the Brutes and Birds in <hi>America</hi> from thoſe in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where the Ark was made, is no Argument againſt their Original from thoſe that were preſerved in the Ark: Becauſe that it doth not yet appear,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64147:106"/>
that thoſe that are now known in this World do differ any more than accidentally from thoſe in the Weſtern World, <hi>viz.</hi> either by the Couplings and Mixtures of Animals of ſeveral <hi>Species,</hi> or by reaſon of the Variety of the Climate, or Temperament thereof; which Variations might be acquired by a diſperſion of them as well into <hi>America,</hi> as other parts of <hi>Europe, Africa</hi> or <hi>Aſia,</hi> after the Univerſal Deluge.</p>
               <p>As to the Second, namely, The difficulty of the firſt Migration of Brutes and Birds from <hi>Aſia</hi> where the <hi>Capita ſpecierum</hi> were firſt created, and after in the Ark preſerved; I ſhall firſt deliver my ſelf from the leſſer difficulties of the Objection, and afterwards conſider the greater.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſeems but little difficulty touching the tranſlation of Birds from hence thither: for although without the ſuppoſition of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Atlantis,</hi> or ſome number of ſmaller Iſlands in a convenient diſtance in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, it is hardly poſſible to ſuppoſe that any Fowls could maintain a flight from <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> croſs the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean into <hi>America;</hi> yet there are other Seas between ſome parts of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Northern parts of <hi>America,</hi> where Fowls by flight might paſs from hence thither, as the <hi>Fretum Anian,</hi> and the Sea bordering upon <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Finland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Water-Fowls, the difficulty is leſs, for they can and do ſupply the wearineſs of a long flight by taking Water, and infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them are found in Iſlands far remote from any Continent, and even in the main Ocean.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to Domeſtick-Fowl, as Hens, Geeſe, Turkies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and tame Animals for uſe, delight, or food, as Horſes, Dogs, Hogs, Sheep, Goats, Deer, Apes, Monkies, Peacocks, Parrots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which <hi>America</hi> is furniſhed; there is as little difficulty but they might be tranſported by ſhipping either for uſe or commerce, eſpecially by the <hi>Africans,</hi> who had ſtore of them; and even Peacocks and Apes were an ancient part of commerce, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.21. and <hi>Acoſta, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. tells us that the Dogs and Cattel tranſported not much above 20 Years before his coming thither from <hi>Spain,</hi> were in that ſpace ſo exceedingly multiplied in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Domingo</hi> and other Iſlands poſſeſſed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> where there were none for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, that they became wild, and filled all the Country, that they were forced to uſe what means they could for the deſtruction of the Dogs, and killed infinite numbers of Cows, meerly for their Skins.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The only difficulty that ſeems to remain, is touching thoſe ferine, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious, and untamable Beaſts, as Lions, Tigers, Wolves, Bears, and Foxes with which that Continent abounds: for it is not probable that theſe ſhould be tranſported by ſhipping; no Men would probably be at that charge and hazard with ſuch Beaſts that would do more harm than good: And although poſſibly the frozen Northern Seas might be a Bridge for their paſſage, yet that ſeems unlikely in reſpect of the great Snows that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſuch Froſts, and the impoſſibility of a ſupply of food in ſo great and troubleſom a Journey: And as to Swimming, though it hath been obſerved that Bears have ſwimmed into Iſlands many Leagues from the Continent to prey upon Fowls, and to return again; and though the Seas between <hi>Tartary</hi> and <hi>Cathay</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>America</hi> be not ſo wide as the <hi>Atlantick</hi> or <hi>Pacifick</hi> Ocean, yet they are too large to afford a paſſage by Sea, eſpecially for Tigers and Lions, which are not ſo apt to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64147:106"/>
take the Water. And it is not yet certainly diſcovered, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that there is any Neck of Ground, or paſſage by Land from any part of <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>Aſia</hi> into any part of the Continent of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remains therefore nothing that I can reaſonably conjecture to accommodate the difficulty, but to ſuppoſe what I have formerly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated; That although it ſhould be granted that there is now no ſuch Land-paſſage extant, yet within the compaſs of 4000 Years elapſed ſince the Flood there have been ſome ſuch Junctures or Land-paſſages between the Northern parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> or <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſome Northern parts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of <hi>America,</hi> or between the South-eaſt parts of <hi>China</hi> or the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippine</hi> Iſlands, and the Southern Continent (though lately there be diſcovered an interpoſition of Sea between the Iſland <hi>del Fuogo</hi> and that Southern Continent) whereby either from <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>Groenland</hi> in the North, or from <hi>China</hi> to <hi>Terra auſtralis incognita</hi> on the South a Land-paſſage might be from <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>America</hi> for Men and Brutes, though for ſome Ages paſt either by the violence of the Water, or by Floods or Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, which hath made great alterations in the Globe of the Earth and Seas, that Bridge or Line of Communication be now broken and obliterated. And truly he that obſerves the infinite company of Iſlands lying between the Continent of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Nova Guinea,</hi> almoſt contiguous to each other, hath probable reaſon to believe that theſe were all formerly one Continent joyning <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Nova Guinea</hi> together, though now by the irruption of the Sea crumbled into many ſmall Iſlands.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. VIII.</hi> The Seventh Evidence of Fact proving the Origination of Man, namely, The Gradual Increaſe of Mankind.</head>
               <p>I Come to the Seventh Evidence of Fact, which ſeems with much ſtrength and clearneſs to evince the Origination of Mankind, and that within ſuch a Period of Time as the Sacred Scriptures propound, namely, The Gradual Increaſe of Mankind upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I mean throughly to examin this Conſideration, I ſhall propound to my Enquiry theſe enſuing Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether according to the ordinary courſe and procedure of Nature in the Generations of Mankind, there be not a gradual and conſiderable Increaſe of Mankind upon the face of the Earth, unleſs ſome collateral Emergency or Occurrence interrupt or correct that Increaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What Correctives there may be ſuppoſed that may check and reſtrain that Increaſe of Mankind, that otherwiſe according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Nature would have obtained in the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether thoſe Correctives or collateral Occurrences which have been, or may be ſuppoſed to have been in the World, have ſo far prevailed, as totally to ſtop that Increaſe of Mankind, which upon a Natural account, without the intervention of ſuch Correctives would have obtained.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:64147:107"/>4. Whether notwithſtanding all theſe Correctives of the Increaſe or Exceſſes of Generations, yet if ſtill the numbers of Mankind have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, it be not a ſufficient Argument to ſatisfie a reaſonable Man that Mankind had an Inception, and that within ſuch a period or compaſs of Duration as is not of a vaſt or prodigious Exceſs.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt of theſe, and I ſhall ſuppoſe, and I think clearly evidence, That without the intervention of ſome accidental or collateral Corrective, Mankind muſt needs increaſe upon the Earth, and that the Generations and Productions of Men and Woman in an ordinary, regular and conſtant courſe of Nature, do very much exceed the Decays of Mankind by Natural courſe of Mortality, allowing into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thoſe common Decays of Mankind by ordinary, uſual and common Diſeaſes incident to Individuals.</p>
               <p>The Laws, eſpecially of the <hi>Romans</hi> and others, have determined the Legal Ages of Matrimonial Conjunction of a Man to be 14, of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be 12; Prudential Conſiderations have protracted it longer. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Third <hi>De Legibus</hi> allows and determins the Age of the Woman ſhould be between 16 and 20, of the Man to be between 30 and 35: we will ſuppoſe the <hi>medium</hi> to be for the Man 26, for the Woman 20. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> determins the extreme time for Generation in the Man to be 70, for the Woman 50; the <hi>medium</hi> to be 65 for the former, 45 for the latter: we will take a ſhorter <hi>medium</hi> for both, and ſuppoſe the extreme term for Procreation for Man to be 55, for the Woman to be 40 Years; upon this account the <hi>terminus</hi> or <hi>periodus procreativa</hi> to be 20 Years: And although within that Period there is a poſſibility of procreation of 20 Children, yet conſidering that all Pairs are not of that fertility, we will take the <hi>medium</hi> to be leſs than a third part, <hi>viz.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>And becauſe upon a due Obſervation of the Sexes of Mankind, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by ſuch as have curiouſly obſerved the Regiſters and Calculations of Births and Burials, there is ſome, though not very conſiderable exceſs of Males above Females, <hi>viz.</hi> as 14 to 13, or in ſome places, as 16 to 15 (an evidence of the wiſe Providence of God, to bring the number of each Sex to ſo near a parity) yet allowing a redundance to the Males, to ſupply thoſe many Caſualties whereunto Males are ſubject by Wars, Navigations, and other Occurrences that more exhauſt the numbers of Men than Woman. Therefore we will allow to Productions of five Couples, about 16 Males and 14 Females; which though not exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering either of thoſe proportions, yet comes near to them, namely, 16 Males to 14 Females.</p>
               <p>And becauſe partly through the weakneſs of Infancy, and thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that happen to Youth either by reaſon of intemperance, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, want of of care, and the ebullition and fermentation of Blood, more dye before 20 Years than between that age and 50, we will ſuppoſe, of thoſe ſix Procreations only two attain to the ſtate of future Nuptials and procreation of ſucceeding Generations; therefore we will allott only two of theſe ſix to attain to the ſtate of Men and Women, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in an ordinary courſe of Nature live to the common age of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>And although the common age of Mankind, when they are paſſed the danger of Childhood and Youth, is 70 Years, yet becauſe I would have
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64147:107"/>
my Suppoſition as eaſie and general as may be, I ſhall allow 60 to be that ordinary Age, abating great Caſualties and Epidemical Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>And upon this account we may juſtly ſuppoſe theſe things; 1. That theſe two Children may be coexiſting with their Parents for near 30 Years; for if the eldeſt be born at 27 Years of the age of the Father, and the other at 30 Years of his age, and live till the Father be 60 Years old, the youngeſt is 30 Years old at the extremity of his Father's age, which we ſuppoſe 60 Years: and 2. Theſe two Children by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage may have likewiſe two, three, or more Children by that time the Father attains 60 Years: So that in the compaſs of about 34 Years the number of two, namely the Father and Mother, is increaſed to the number of eight, namely, the Father and Mother, their two Children, and four Grand-children; ſo that in 34 Years they become increaſed in a quadruple proportion, and all coexiſting: and although by that time we ſuppoſe the Father and Mother dye, yet in the like Period of thirty four by a Geometrical Proportion their Increaſe is multiplied proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Exceſs of their number above Two.</p>
               <p>But if we ſhall ſuppoſe that the <hi>Technogonia</hi> began ſooner, as at 17 or 18 Years, and continued longer, <hi>viz.</hi> until 65, and that the Ages of Mens Lives were protracted generally to 70 Years, the Increaſe would be very much greater.</p>
               <p>And upon this account it is, that conſidering the long Lives of the Ancients ſhortly after the Flood, and the long continuance of their ſtrength of Procreation, <hi>Petavius</hi> in his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book <hi>De doctrina Temporum; cap.</hi> 14. and before him, <hi>Temporarius</hi> in his Chronology gives us a plain Demonſtration, That within the compaſs of 215 Years after the Flood the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> and their Deſcendents might without a Miracle increaſe to prodigious and incredible multitudes. The number of coexiſting Individuals is by one of theſe Authors with very clear evidence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to 1219133512, deſcended from one of the Sons of <hi>Noah.</hi> And therefore, that allowing the beginning of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Monarchy to have been about 153 Years after the Flood, it might ſhortly after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Ninus</hi> his Empire, which is ſuppoſed to have been about 215 Years after the Flood, have grown to that greatneſs, that might eaſily render credible the mighty Cities that were built by him, and the great Armies that he raiſed, and the Battles that he fought, and vaſt Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that he made and ſuffered; But if we ſhould follow the Account of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> which gives us a far greater Period of Time from the Flood to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the advantage of the Increaſe would be ſignally greater; although the common Account of the <hi>Jews</hi> render the Increaſe eaſily credible, without the help of a Miracle.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that there can be no greater evidence of this Truth of the Increaſe of Mankind than Experience and Obſervation, neither can there be any Obſervation or Experience of greater certainty, than the ſtrict and vigilant Obſervance of the Calculations and Regiſters of the Bills of Births and Deaths; and becauſe I do not know any one thing rendred clearer to the view, than this Gradual Increaſe of Mankind, by the curious and ſtrict Obſervations of a little Pamphlet, entitled <hi>Obſervations upon the Bills of Mortality,</hi> lately printed, I ſhall not decline that light or evidence that this little Book affords in this matter; wherein he plainly evinceth,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:64147:108"/>1. That the number of Males to Females is regularly as 14 to 13, or as 16 to 15. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſuppoſing the number of breeding Couples to be 48000, in about the ſpace of 7 Years, in a healthy time, or in 8 Years, if there be Plagues, the great City of <hi>London,</hi> which is not ſo healthy as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, will double, without the help of the acceſs of Foreiners: and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> doubling themſelves every 64 Years, would in the Period of 5610 Years, the ſuppoſed diſtance from the Creation of Man, produce a far greater number of Mankind than are now in the World. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in the Countrey, which is generally more healthy than <hi>London,</hi> upon a <hi>medium</hi> of Obſervation of 90 Years, there are five Births for four Burials, ſometimes three to two, and ſeldom in any Year theſe Burials equalled or exceeded the Births; or if they did, yet the ſucceeding Years ballanced it to that proportion of 5 to 4; for in the ſpace of 90 Years 1059 were Born in one Pariſh more than were Buried. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this Redundance did not much increaſe the place or Pariſh it ſelf, becauſe by tranſmigrations to <hi>London,</hi> to Forein Plantations, and other places of Trade, they disburthened the proportion of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and added to the greatneſs and amplitude of other places, eſpecially <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That conſidering the ſmall exceſs of the number of Males above the number of Females, and conſidering the redundancy of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Males is only ſufficient to make good that decay of Males above Females, by Wars and Navigation, and other Accidents more incident to Males than Females; there is very near a parity of Males and Females in the World, to keep it in a conſonancy and congruity to the firſt inſtitution of Matrimonial ſociety between one Man and one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That conſequently Polygamy doth not in the general conduce to the Increaſe of Mankind, becauſe the natural or ordinary proportion between the number of each is equal. But in as much as by reaſon of the great Conſumption of Males among the <hi>Turks,</hi> by divers Accidents, eſpecially that of their great Wars between them and the <hi>Perſians, Tartars, Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Moors;</hi> whereby there is, or at leaſt in ſome Ages was, a great redundance of the number of Woman above the number of Men: The uſe of Polygamy allowed among them, gives a greater increaſe of People than otherwiſe would be; becauſe of the exceſs of the number of Women above the number of Men, by ſuch Accidents.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe plain and evident Obſervations of the ſeemingly inconſiderable Pamphlets; which give a greater Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Gradual Increaſe of Mankind upon the face of the Earth, than a hundred notional Arguments can either evince or confute, and therefore I think them worthy of being mentioned to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Upon all which, and much more that might be ſaid, it is evident, That according to the ordinary courſe of Nature, though thoſe common and uſual Accidents of common Sickneſſes, ordinary Caſualties, and common Events are incident to Humane Nature; the number of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind doth and muſt neceſſarily increaſe in the World, and the Natural Supplies of Mankind are greater, and more numerous than the Decays
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64147:108"/>
thereof. I now therefore come to the Second Conſideration, namely, The Examination of the extraordinary or more univerſal Correctives of the Multiplication of Mankind, which becauſe it will be large, I ſhall allow unto it a diſtinct Chapter.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="chapter">
               <head>
                  <hi>CAP. IX.</hi> Concerning thoſe Correctives of the Exceſs of Mankind which may be thought to be ſufficient to reduce it to a greater Equability.</head>
               <p>I Come now to the Second premiſed Conſideration and Inquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether there may not be found ſome extraordinary Occurrences and Correctives, that may reduce that otherwiſe Natural and ordinary Increaſe of Mankind to an Equability: And I call them Extraordinary, not ſimply in reſpect of themſelves, but in oppoſition to thoſe daily and ordinary Caſualties which happen to Humane Nature; and in reſpect of thoſe great Diſtances and Periods, whether certain or caſual, wherein they may be ſuppoſed to happen: And I ſhall improve this Objection againſt the Increaſe <hi>de facto</hi> of Mankind, with the greateſt impartiality and advantage that may be.</p>
               <p>It is certain that the Increaſe of Brutes, and other Animals which are perfect and univocally generated, is very great in the World: <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that inquiſitive Searcher into Nature, in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of the Hiſtory of Animals hath given us an Account touching moſt Animals, of the length of their Lives, times of their Breeding, intervals of their Birth; wherein though poſſibly there may be variation in ſeveral Climates, yet his Account may give a near eſtimate, proportionable alſo to other places.</p>
               <p>For Inſtance, the Cow breeds in the ſecond Year, brings forth the tenth Month; lives 15 or 20 Years: the Mare breeds the third Year, brings forth in the twelfth Month; lives 25, 30, and ſometimes 40 Years; the Sheep and Goat bear in the ſecond Year, bring forth in the beginning of the ſixth Month, ſometimes two, ordinarily but one; lives 10, 12, or 13 Years: Sows breed in the ſecond Year, bring forth after four Months; their Young numerous: Bitches breed in the latter end of the firſt or beginning of the ſecond Year, bring forth after threeſcore Days, or in the ninth Week; their Young many, 5, 6, or ſometimes 12; they live 10 or 12, ſometimes 15 or 20 Years: Wolves breed and bring forth as Dogs, only their number fewer, ſometimes 2, ſometimes 3, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 4: the Doe brings forth after eight Months complete, but one, and ſometimes two; and live long: the Fox breeds 4, the Cat 5 or 6; and lives 6 Years, many times more: the ſpeedy and numerous increaſe of Mice is prodigious; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> mentions 120 produced of one Female in a very little time; <hi>Pliny</hi> in his 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book, <hi>Cap.</hi> 63. hath in effect tranſcribed <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> herein.</p>
               <p>By this it appears, That the Natural Increaſe of theſe Animals is much greater than of Men, yet their numbers have not arrived to that great
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64147:109"/>
exceſs, becauſe thoſe that are for food have their reduction by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for that purpoſe; thoſe that are domeſtical, and not for food, as Cats and Dogs, are kept within compaſs by drowning or deſtroying their Young; and thoſe that are noxious, as Wolves and Foxes, are reduced by that common deſtruction that Men purſue them with.</p>
               <p>Touching Birds, their Increaſe ſeems to be much greater than of Men or Brutes, but they have thoſe reductions that bring them to a fair equability, unleſs it be in thoſe Iſlands and Rocks in the Sea unacceſſible by Men, where Sea-Fowls breed. Firſt, their number is reduced by Man for food: 2. For deſtruction, as in Birds that are noxious: 3. By the natural ſhortneſs of the Lives of many that are yet numerous breeders: 4. By the mutual deſtruction of the weaker by Birds of prey; whereof more particularly hereafter: 5. By the Winter cold, which ſtarves very many, either for want of heat or food; and of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Fiſhes are infinitely more numerous or increaſing than Beaſts or Birds, as appears by the numerous Spawn of any one Fiſh, though ordinarily they breed but once a Year; and if all theſe ſhould come ro maturity, even the Ocean it ſelf would have been long ſince over-ſtored with Fiſh. Now the Correctives and Reductions of theſe are very many. 1. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> obſerves in his 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>de Hiſtoria Animalium, cap.</hi> 13. Thoſe Eggs that are not ſprinkled, <hi>aſpergine ſeminis genitalis maris,</hi> prove unfruitful; a great part are devoured by the Male, and much more by other Fiſh: ſome of their Eggs are buried in the ſlime, and corrupted. 2. Many are taken by Men, and employed for food. 3. As among Birds and Beaſts they are Beaſts and Birds of prey, which are leſs numerous than others, ſo eſpecially among Fiſh: And though the Wiſdom of Providence hath given certain Expedients to Animals, eſpecially Fiſhes of the weaker nature, to eſcape the voracious; as ſwiftneſs to ſome, ſmalneſs to others, whereby they eſcape to Shallows and Shoars unacceſſible to the greater: and to thoſe that are not able to move, or at leaſt not to move ſwiftly, the protection of Shells; as Oyſters, Eſcalops, Crabs, Lobſters and other Shell-fiſh; yet a very great number are devoured by the voracious kind. I do remember, that a Friend of mine having ſtored a very great Pond of 3 or 4 Acres of ground with Carps, Tench, and divers other Pond-fiſh, of a very great number, and only put in two very little ſmall Pikes; at 7 Years end, upon the draught of his Pond, not one Fiſh was left, but the two Pikes grown to an exceſſive bigneſs, and all the reſt, together with their millions of Fry devoured by thoſe pair of Tyrants. 4. Birds alſo of prey, as Storks, Herons, Cormorants, and other Fowl of that kind deſtroy many both in the Sea, Rivers, Ponds and Lakes. 5. Extreme Froſt, eſpecially in Ponds and Lakes, make a great deſtruction of Fiſh, partly by freezing them, partly by the excluſion of the ambient Air, which inſinuates it ſelf into the Water, and is neceſſary for the preſervation of the Lives of thoſe watry Inhabitants. 6. By great Heats and Droughts, not only drying up Lakes, Ponds, and Rivers, but alſo tainting the Water with exceſſive heat; and though theſe two do not ſo much concern Sea-fiſh, who have more ſcope and room, yet they have a great influx upon Rivers, Ponds, and Lakes.</p>
               <p>Again, to ſay ſomething of Inſects, whether aiery, terreſtrial, or watry;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64147:109"/>
they ſeem to be more numerous than the common ſorts of univocal Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, who have an univocal production. For firſt, their firſt production is ſtrangely numerous, out of Putrefaction and much Moiſture, influenced by Heat. Hence <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in his firſt Book tells us of the numerous productions of Mice after every Inundation of <hi>Nilus,</hi> ſenſibly and viſibly growing out of the ſlime; <hi>Juxta, Thebaidem, cum Nili ceſſavit inundatio, calefaciente Sole limum ab aqua relictum, multis in locis ex terrae hiatu mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo Murium oritur:</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo obſerves, as frequent in other places, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Hiſtor. Animal. cap.</hi> 37. <hi>Locis enim compluribus tam inaudito modo oriri ſolent, ut parum ex univerſo frumento relinquatur.</hi> And in my remembrance, after the drayning of the great Level in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> and other Shires, ſuch an innumerable company of Mice did upon a ſudden in the Summer time ariſe, as it were immediately out of the ſlimy Earth warmed by the Sun, that they were conſtrained to cut their Banks to drown the Lands, and ſo cure one Inundation with another.</p>
               <p>The like numerous production of Frogs happens in ſome Years, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the firſt Section of his Problems, and Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> out of him makes a Prognoſtick of a ſickly Year; becauſe ſuch Productions are the effect of a great degree of Putrefaction in the Elementary Bodies. And we read, that in <hi>Norway</hi> there was not long ſince ſuch innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of Field-Rats of a new Make produced, ſomewhat larger than Rats, that they threatned a general Conſumption of all their Fruits, but by ſome extreme hard weather they were deſtroyed; yet ſo as the multitude of their Carcaſes produced a noyſom Contagion in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. And the like numerous production every Year gives us, though ſome Years more than others, of divers other kind of Inſects, as Flies, Locuſts, Worms, Caterpillars, and divers others, which in ſome Countries ſo abound, that they cover the face of the ground, eſpecially in the parts of <hi>Africa: quod vide,</hi> in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of <hi>Leo</hi> his Hiſtory of <hi>Africa,</hi> and thoſe additions out of <hi>Paulus Oroſius</hi> and <hi>Alvarez</hi> in confirmation thereof. 2. As this original ſpontaneous production is very numerous, ſo the multiplication of theſe Inſects by their Eggs or Seeds is infinitely more; their Lives are ſhort, ſome dye within the compaſs of one Summer, as the Silk-worm: yet a curious Obſerver of that Inſect, namely <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pighius,</hi> hath given us an account of the number of Eggs of one Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm in one Year to be above 500; though all poſſibly prove not fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet preſerved carefully from the injury of the Winter, many of them come to perfection the next Spring: And it is apparent that the <hi>Erucae,</hi> Caterpillars and Worms we ſee upon Hedges and Leaves, multiply their Seeds to a very great exceſs; and this is much more viſible in the Spawn and production of Frogs, and alſo in the multiplication of Mice, the blowings of Flies, and almoſt all kind of Inſects; though their Lives are ſhorter, yet their productions are more numerous and frequent in the ſhort Period of their Lives, than the perfect Animals. So that if there ſhould not be ſome Corrective of the exceſſes of their Productions, the whole Atmoſphere, Earth and Waters would be crouded with their numbers: The contrary whereof is nevertheleſs apparent, for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of one Summer are for the moſt part exhauſted, and inviſible by the next Spring.</p>
               <p>The Correctives therefore of the numerous Exceſs of Inſects ſeem to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64147:110"/>
be principally theſe: 1. The Induſtry of Mankind, in deſtruction of noxious Inſects. 2. The Wiſe Providence hath placed a certain Antipathy between ſome Animals, and many Inſects, whereby they delight in their deſtruction, though they uſe them not as food: As, the Peacock deſtroys Snakes and Adders; the Weaſel, Mice and Rats; Spiders, Flies; and ſome ſorts of Flies deſtroy Spiders. 3. The common ſort of Inſects are the ordinary food of divers Animals, as well Inſects as others: The Spider and all ſorts of ſmall Birds, eſpecially the Swallow, feed upon Flies; the Mole feeds upon Worms; Ducks and divers Water-fowl upon Frogs; the Cat and Owl upon Mice: and thus Inſects become the prey of other Animals, which correct their exceſs. 4. As the hot and moiſt temperament of the Air and Earth produce and increaſe Inſects, ſo that temperament of the Air, Earth, and Waters that ſeems moſt oppoſite to Putrefaction, either deſtroys many of the Individuals, or at leaſt renders their numerous Eggs and Seeds unfruitful, and reſiſts as well the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Production of them from Putrefaction, or abates the Prolifick power of their Eggs or Seeds. 5. Great Rains, and Showers, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of Waters drowns oftentimes many ſorts of Inſects, and renders their Seeds and Eggs unprolifick, or deſtroys them. 6. But eſpecially the Winter Cold, Froſt and Snow do kill many Inſects, and their Eggs and Seeds, and renders them unfruitful. The Cold and Winter ſeaſon is a great Enemy not only to Inſects, but to many ſorts of Birds, Beaſts and Fiſhes: and therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> moſt truly obſerves in his 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Hiſt. Animalium, cap.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that to avoid the ſeverity of the approaching Cold, many of them retire into the cloſeſt and warmeſt Caverns they can get; wherein ſome lye for many Months without the benefit of Food, and if they eſcape the ſeverity of the Cold, they as it were revive the next Spring. For inſtance, Serpents hide themſelves 4 Months, Swallows betake themſelves all the Winter to low Vallies and Caverns, Tortoiſes cloſe up themſelves in Holes and Earth all the Winter, as is obvious to daily Experiences; <hi>Et Inſecta penè omnia conduntur, praeter ea quae vitam in domiciliis cum hominibus agunt, quaeque prius intereunt quam omnino tempus excedunt.</hi> And therefore Bees keep themſelves cloſe in their Hives, <hi>ab ortu Vergiliarum,</hi> till the next Spring. And yet, though Nature hath given Inſects this Sagacity to avoid the Winter Cold, yet they are not always ſucceſsful in it, but the ſeverity of the Winter finds them out, and deſtroys them: But as for their Seeds or Eggs, which in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Summer are laid up and down upon Leaves, and in other places, they are for the moſt part deſtroyed by the Winter; except ſuch as caſually by the Wind or otherwiſe are diſperſed, and lodged in ſafer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles, and thereby ſurvive the inclemency of the Winter, and yield a new Production or Increaſe the next Spring.</p>
               <p>And thus we have ſeen the Methods and Correctives, that by the Divine diſpoſition of theſe ſmall and inconſiderable pieces of Nature are uſed; whereby at once there is a preſervation of the Kind of thoſe little Animals, and yet a prevention of that Exceſs and Redundance which would happen by their numerous Increaſe, to the detriment and ſurcharge of the inferior World.</p>
               <p>In all this Conſideration of the Reduction of Exceſſes and Increaſe of Animals and Inſects, two things are obſervable in a ſpecial manner, namely;</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:64147:110"/>1. That in the ſtate of Animals and Inſects, we may ſee ſomething that is analogal to the ſtate of the Elementary and mixed Inanimate Bodies; that there are ſome more active and vigorous Qualities, that ſeem continually to exerciſe a Sovereignty and Tyranny over the more paſſive and weak Natures, and prey upon them: Thus Heat, and alſo in ſome degree Cold, are always perſecuting and foyning at the weaker and more unactive parts of Nature: So among Brutes, Birds, Fiſhes, Inſects there is a continual invading and prevalence of the more powerful, active and lively, over the more weak, flegmatick, and unactive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the Bear, Lion, Wolf, Dog, Fox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> purſue the Sheep, Oxen, Hare, Coney, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and prey upon them: the like is evident among Birds and Fiſhes, and generally Inſects, being the weaker and more inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable parts of Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the viciſſitudes of Generation and Corruption are by a kind of ſtanding Law in Nature fixed in things, and the Notions and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Natural things are ſo ordered, to keep always that great Wheel in circulation; and therein the Acceſſes and Receſſes of the Sun, the Influxes of the Heat thereof and of the other Heavenly Bodies, and the mutual and reſtleſs Agitation of thoſe two great Engins in Nature, Heat and Cold, are the great Inſtruments of keeping on foot the Rotation and Circle of Generations and Corruptions, eſpecially of Animals and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables of all ſorts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That yet theſe Motions of Generations and Corruptions, and of the conducibles thereunto, are ſo wiſely and admirably ordered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperated, and ſo continually managed and ordered by the wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the Rector of all things, that things are kept in a certain due ſtay and equability: and though the Motions of Generations and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and the Inſtruments and Engins thereof are in a continual courſe, neither the exceſs of Generations doth oppreſs and over-charge the World, nor the defect thereof, or prevalence of Corruptions doth put a Period to the <hi>Species</hi> of things, nor work a total Diſſolution in Nature.</p>
               <p>And upon this ſeemingly impertinent Diverſion touching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions and Correctives of theſe inferior Animals, there may ſeem to be collected reaſonably an analogical Inference of the like means of the Correctives of the Generations of Mankind; and that although in an ordinary courſe of Humane Productions the Increaſe ſurmounts the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, yet there may be reaſonably ſuppoſed ſuch Periodical Corrections as might fairly keep the ſtate of Mankind in a mediocrity and equability, although it ſhould be ſuppoſed the Generations of Mankind had been Eternal.</p>
               <p>And although theſe Correctives may not happen every Day, or every Year in the ordinary courſe of things, and therefore may be called extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, becauſe they are leſs ordinary than the common Caſualties of Mankind, as Sickneſs or Accident that happens to this or that individual Perſon promiſcuouſly; yet they are in truth no more extraordinary, than a cold Winter is extraordinary; which although it is not every Day, nor doth it happen every Year poſſibly in an equal Degree, yet it is no extraordinary thing in Nature, if it happens once in 5, or 10, or 20 Years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:64147:111"/>Having therefore conſidered theſe Correctives in the inferior Animal Nature, I ſhall now ſearch out what may be thoſe Correctives, that may be applicable to the Reductions of the Generations of Mankind to an Equability, or at leaſt to keep it within ſuch bounds as may keep it from ſurcharging the World; whereby if in the Period of 2, or 3, or 4000 Years it may grow too luxuriant, yet it may in probability be ſo far abated, as may allow it an Increaſe of the like number of Years to attain its former proportion. So that by theſe Prunings there may be a conſiſtency of the Numbers of Mankind, with an eternal ſucceſſion of Individuals.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Reductions that may be ſuppoſed effectual for theſe Ends, and ſuch as the courſe of Mankind ſeem to have had great Experiences of, are, 1. Plagues and Epidemical Diſeaſes: 2. Famines: 3. Wars and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necions: 4. Floods and Inundations: 5. Conflagrations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning Plagues and Epidemical Diſeaſes, the Hiſtories of all times give us Accounts of the great Devaſtations that they have made in many places: and ſometimes it hath been, it is true, only in ſome particular Regions or Cities, but at other times it hath been more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal; and although at the ſame time, in ſome Seaſons, it hath not univerſally prevailed, yet it hath gradually and ſucceſſively moved from place to place.</p>
               <p>The ancient Plagues of former Ages in Forein Parts have been very terrible, and cut off multitudes of People: See a Collection of ſome of them by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Vide Lipſium de Conſtantia, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>And if we look upon our own Country, beſides thoſe great Plagues that have been in a manner univerſal, there have been very many ſuch in <hi>England;</hi> ſometimes more general, ſometimes more circumſcribed to particular Cities or places: As that Plague in the North parts of <hi>England,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Walſingham</hi> in the beginning of <hi>R.</hi> 2. that in a manner depopulated thoſe Parts: that mentioned by the ſame Author, <hi>Anno</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. whereby there dyed in one Year 30000 in <hi>London</hi> (which was conſiderable then, conſidering the narrowneſs of the City in thoſe days, comparatively to what it now is) beſides the great deſolation it made in the Country.</p>

                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:64147:111"/>If we come to latter Years, both in <hi>England</hi> and in Forein Parts, the Obſervator of the Bills of Mortality before mentioned hath given us the beſt Account of the Number that late Plagues have ſwept away; for Inſtance,

And <hi>Leo</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Africa,</hi> tells us, that the Peſtilence is ſo hot ſometimes in that City, that there dye 12000 almoſt every Day; and <hi>Pliny</hi> in 7. <hi>Nat.

               <p>So that upon the account of Plagues, and extraordinary Epidemical Diſeaſes, there ſeems to be a great Corrective of the Redundance and Increaſe of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us a little take notice of Famines, which though they have not been of late times much obſerved, partly becauſe of the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of Mankind, improving and increaſing the Fruits of the Earth; partly by thoſe Supplies that have come by Sea to thoſe Countries that are in want; but principally by the goodneſs of God, in lending the Children of Men ſeaſonable Weather, and fruitful Seaſons, and proſperous Influences: yet in former times they have been very grievous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed multitudes of People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walſingham</hi> in the Life of <hi>E.</hi> 2. tells us of ſo ſevere a Famine in <hi>England,</hi> that they were enforced to eat Dogs and Horſes, yea and ſtole Children and eat them; <hi>viz.</hi> 9 <hi>E.</hi> 2. And divers other Inſtances our own Hiſtories give us of other great Famines in this and other Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:64147:112"/>Ordinarily a Famine and a Plague anciently went together, or the former followed upon the heels of the Plague, by reaſon of ſome of theſe means: 1. Commonly the ſame diſtemperature of the Air that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Plague, occaſioned alſo the infertility or noxiouſneſs of the Soil, whereby the Fruits of the Earth became either very ſmall, or very unwholſom: As it happened in that Famine under <hi>E.</hi> 2. above mentioned, in ſo much that the Hiſtorian tells us, that <hi>Medicinales herbae, quae leva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men languidis conferre ſolebant, per Veris intemperiem &amp; Elementorum inae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitatem, contra naturam effectae degeneres, virus pro virtute reddebant.</hi> 2. Commonly the Plague among Men was accompanied or followed with a Rot or Murrain among Cattel, whereby the fleſh of Beaſts was wanting, or noxious to thoſe that uſed it. 3. Commonly by a great and general Mortality or Plague the Husbandmen and Labourers were ſo diminiſhed, that there wanted People to gather in the Harveſt, or Till the Ground, whereby there neceſſarily enſued a Famine: And oftentimes by a kind of neceſſity Famines were durable, the Stock being exhauſted one Year, left little for the ſupply of Tillage, Husbandry, or Increaſe for the next.</p>
               <p>And as Famine was anciently the Concomitant or Conſequent of Plague, ſo both Plague and Famine, eſpecially the latter, were the uſual Conſequents of War, which bring with it Devaſtation and Deſtruction, and a general intermiſſion of that Husbandry and Care that ſhould ſupply it.</p>
               <p>The terrible Effects of Famine, and the great Conſumption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that is occaſioned, was principally 1. Of the Poor, who upon the bare increaſe of the Price of Victuals, and wanting wherewith to buy, muſt needs occaſion their ſtarving, or a tumultuous gaining it by force, where they could not get it; which was but a ſhort and temporary Relief, and made more want after, by the ſpoil and diſorder occaſioned thereby. 2. Of numerous Armies, who being brought into places of want or ſcarcity without due Conduct or Proviſion, are oftentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in a Week, eſpecially in cloſe and long Sieges, as it happened in <hi>Samaria</hi> when beſieged by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> when beſieged by the <hi>Romans,</hi> wherein more dyed by the Famine than by the Sword.</p>
               <p>So that Famines as well as Plagues ſeem to give a great Reduction to the Numbers of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A few words may ſerve concerning Wars, which are ſo frequent, and bring ſo great a Deſolation upon Mankind, that it ſeems to equal that allay of the Exceſſes of Brutes, Fiſhes, Birds, and Inſects, by the other Beaſts, Birds, or Fiſhes of prey; and the rather, becauſe many if not all the conſiderable Parts of the World are ſome Years at it, though it may be ſome Ages free from Peſtilences and Famines (other than ſuch as are conſequences of War) but in no Age nor Year of the World hath it been quiet from Wars, and thoſe calamitous conſequences thereof, at leaſt in ſome conſiderable parts of the World.</p>
               <p>It would be endleſs, and indeed Morally impoſſible, to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Numbers of People and Armies that have been cut off by Wars, eſpecially on the ſide of the Conquered. Some few Inſtances may give ſome kind of Eſtimate herein.</p>

               <p>So that it ſhould ſeem, there needed no other Reductive of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Men to an Equability, than the Wars that have happened in the World.</p>
               <p>And although Wars are in a great meaſure accidental, or at leaſt proceed in a great meaſure from the Wills of Men, their Pride, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, impatience of Injuries, affectation of Dominion, mutual Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Fears of the Potency of each other, and oftentimes accidental Emergencies and Occurrences; yet it ſeems, that abſtracting from all theſe Occaſions, Wars ſeem to be in a manner a Natural Conſequence of the over-plenitude and redundancy of the Number of Men in the World: And ſo by a kind of congruity and conſequence, morally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary when the World grows too full of Inhabitants, that there is not room one by another; or that the common Supplies which the World ſhould afford to Mankind begin to be too few, too ſtrait, or too narrow for the Numbers of Men; that natural propenſion of Self-love, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principle of Self-preſervation will neceſſarily break out into Wars and Internecions, to make room for thoſe that find themſelves ſtraitned or inconvenienced.</p>
               <p>So that as when the Channel of a River is over-charged with Water more than it can deliver, it neceſſarily breaks over the Banks to make it ſelf room; or when the very Brutes or Animals find themſelves oppreſſed and ſtraitned in their proviſions and ſupplies, by the redundance of their numbers, one neceſſarily preys upon another, or deſtroys another to preſerve it ſelf: So Wars among Mankind are a kind of neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of Redundance of Mankind, and will by a kind of Natural neceſſity make it ſelf room, and give it ſelf eaſe by the deſtruction of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64147:113"/>
others, if it can get power and opportunity to do it: And conſequently there ſeems to be no fear of the ſurcharge of the World with Mankind, becauſe there is this natural and neceſſary Remedy at hand; the very Redundance it ſelf of Mankind ſeeming by a natural conſecution to yield and ſubminiſter this Remedy, for its Reduction and Equation. As in a redundance of Humors in the Body, the moſt lively and active do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thruſt out thoſe that are weaker or noxious, to make room for themſelves: or as Bees ſwarm to get new habitations, when they are ſo increaſed that their Hives will not hold them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Concerning the Fourth, and alſo, incluſively the Fifth Corrective of the Exceſs of Mankind, namely, Inundations and Conflagrations.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that have been Obſervers of things in Nature and Hiſtories of former times, have given us Inſtances of two kinds of Mutations in this Terreſtrial Globe of Earth and Waters: ſome that are more ordinary, and of leſs moment, and of ſuch various have been in the World; ſuch are thoſe mentioned eſpecially by <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Natural Hiſtory, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 85. <hi>&amp; ſeqq.</hi> ſome places ſevered from the Continent by the interruption of the Sea; thus he tells us that <hi>Sicily</hi> was divided from <hi>Italy, Cyprus</hi> from <hi>Syria, Euboea</hi> from <hi>Boeotia, Atlantis</hi> and <hi>Macris</hi> from <hi>Euboea, Bosticum</hi> from <hi>Bythinia;</hi> and ſome have thought, though perhaps upon very ſmall evidence, that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were ſometimes one Continent, and divided by the interruption of the Sea; and <hi>Spain</hi> from <hi>Africa.</hi> Again, ſome Cities and Countries ſwallowed up by the Sea; as <hi>Pirrha</hi> and <hi>Antiſſa, Elis</hi> and <hi>Buta,</hi> half the City of <hi>Tyndaris</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and 30 Miles of the Iſland <hi>Cea,</hi> with a great deſtruction of Men and Cattel: ſome Countries wholly ſwallowed up and drowned in the Sea; as <hi>Acarnania, Achaia,</hi> part of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> in <hi>Propontis:</hi> but above all, that great Iſland of <hi>Atlantis,</hi> ſuppoſed by <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus</hi> to be greater than <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſwallowed up in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, to which it gives its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination: but <hi>Plato</hi> is oftentimes ſo Poetical, that we can hardly tell where he means in earneſt.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, many times the Sea by a certain recompence makes new room for the Inhabitants of the World, ſometimes by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing notable Iſlands; thus the ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us that <hi>Delos, Rhodes, Anaphe, Nea, Thera,</hi> and <hi>Tereſia, Hiera, Automate, Thia</hi> were produced.</p>
               <p>Again, the Sea hath deſerted vaſt Tracts of Ground in divers places, and left them dry Land, as is related by <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the ſecond of his Meteors, <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. and by <hi>Pliny</hi> in a great meaſure, out of him and <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus.</hi> Thus conſiderable quantities of Land were left by the Sea at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> at <hi>Ambracia</hi> and other Parts; and that a very great part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> namely, that called <hi>Delta</hi> is but the accretion of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and was ſometime covered with Water: and according to the conjecture of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> the Sea poſſeſſed <hi>Memphis</hi> and a great part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> But theſe are but Conjectures of the Hiſtorian, of what might be in ſome thouſand Years before he was born. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> indeed ſuppoſeth, that the City <hi>Thebes</hi> and the adjacent Parts, were all that were habitable in <hi>Egypt</hi> in the time of <hi>Homer,</hi> becauſe he makes no mention of <hi>Memphis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe ſmaller Viciſſitudes, and mutual borrowings and payments between the Earth and Sea, are not thoſe Mutations which ſo much
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64147:113"/>
contribute to the Reduction of Mankind; partly, becauſe they are gradual and give Men opportunity to eſcape; and partly becauſe they are not ſuch Devaſtations as may be <hi>pares huic negotio</hi> (unleſs we believe that wonderful ſwallowing up of the vaſt Iſland, or rather Continent of <hi>Atlantis,</hi>) and partly becauſe the Sea, which commonly gives in one place what it takes in another, and ſo makes room for the Inhabitants of the World in compenſation of what it takes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore I come to thoſe greater ſuppoſed Correctives, namely, 1. Floods and Inundations: 2. <hi>Incendia,</hi> Burnings; and again, both, or either of thoſe are alſo varied, according to the Opinions of ſome of the Ancients.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are either ſuch as were all at one time, and did wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm and confound this lower World: or 2. They are ſuch as did not wholly diſſolve the lower Word, or put a period to all things living therein.</p>
               <p>Again, the former Opinion that held theſe Cataclyſms and Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſes univerſal, was ſuch, as either held that it put a total Conſummation unto things in this lower World, eſpecially that of Conflagration: Or elſe ſuch, as though it quite for the preſent confounded the Face of things, eſpecially in this inferior World; yet it was but preparative to a new Formation of things, wherein all things would be put into better Order, till in proceſs of time they again degenerate, and ſo were to receive another Purgation by Fire or Water, according to the fatal Viciſſitudes to which the World is ſubject: And they ſuppoſe, that theſe ſucceſſive unmaking and making again of the World (not unlike the Suppoſitions of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> or <hi>Empedocles</hi>) were Eternal, and ſhould eternally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this Viciſſitude; that the laſt Deſtruction of the World was by Water, and that which is to ſucceed is by Fire: And this was for the moſt part the Opinion of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> whereof <hi>Lipſius</hi> in his ſecond Book <hi>de Phyſiologia Stoicorum, cap.</hi> 21, 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath given us a large Account, out of <hi>Seneca</hi> eſpecially, and others which are not neceſſary to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; and the rather, becauſe they do ſuppoſe that Mankind is neither Eternal nor Perpetual, according to the courſe of Natural Generation: For theſe mighty Concuſſions of Nature, eſpecially that of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Conflagration, puts an end to all the Race of Mankind and all living Bodies; though in the Redintegration of the World after theſe Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions there is alſo a Re-production of Mankind, but not by the ordinary method of Propagation as now.</p>
               <p>Again, as to thoſe others that held alſo certain Periodical Cataclyſms and Conflagrations, yet they held them not to be Univerſal, nor any Univerſal Diſſolution or Deſtruction of the inferior World thereby; but they were ſuch as were great and notable Devaſtations, ſometimes in one part of the Earth, ſometimes in another; either by certain Rotations, or at leaſt in ſome places more than in other, acocrding to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation or diſaccommodation of them to ſuch Calamities: As the Vallies and lower grounds were more ſubject to devaſtation by Floods, ſo the more Mountainous parts were more ſubject to the deſolations by Fire and Conflagrations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato,</hi> who ſeems very uncertain and unſetled in his Philoſophy, ſeems yet to agree with this partial kind of exhauſting the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64147:114"/>
of Men and Brutes, by ſuch partial Floods and Conflagrations.</p>
               <p>In his third Book of Dialogues, <hi>de Legibus,</hi> he gives us an Account of various Methods of the Declinations of Civil Societies, and of thoſe Laws and Cuſtoms, Arts and Sciences in ſeveral parts of the World: and again, how and by what degrees they have been repaired and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; the means whereof he aſſigns not only to be Wars and Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Diſeaſes, but great Floods and Conflagrations, which, together with thoſe of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> relating thereunto, I ſhall tranſcribe out of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation, becauſe perchance more ſignificant than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though not ſo ſignificant as the Language wherein they wrote. And this I do intend to tranſcribe more largely, becauſe they ſeem to contain the full declaration of the Inſtances of this nature.</p>
               <p>He tells us therefore in the beginning of his third Book <hi>de Legibus; Multos hominun interitus ex diluviis, morbis, aliíſque permultis, olim accidiſſe, ex quibus pauci homines ſuperſtites fuerunt.</hi> Again: <hi>Eos qui cladem tum evaſerunt (ſcilicet ex diluviis) montanos quoſdam paſtores fuiſſe, in montium cacuminibus pauca ſemina ad propagandum genus humanum conſervata: atqui neceſſe eſt eos aliarum artium fuiſſe expertes, campeſtres autem &amp; maritimae urbes funditus illo tempore perierunt. Inſtrumenta igitur omnia, &amp; quaecunque artium ſive ad diſciplinam civilem ſive ad facultatem aliam pertinentium, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabant inventa, concidiſſe illis temporibus.</hi> And afterwards: <hi>Ex ea itaque devaſtatione magnam terribilémque humanis in rebus deſolationem tunc accidiſſe arbitramur; fertilium agrorum magnitudinem deſertam, caeteríſque animalibus corruptis, vix boum caprarúmque genus, &amp; illud quidem rarum relictum fuiſſe, quibus paſcendis tunc homines vitam agebant; civitatis verò &amp; diſciplinae civilis &amp; legum memoriam quidem nullam fuiſſe putamus. Tempore igitur progrediente, &amp;c. genere hominum multiplicato, ad eum quem nunc videmus habitum provecta omnia ſunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the ſame <hi>Plato</hi> though in his <hi>Timaeus</hi> he gives us an Account of the Origination of Mankind, yet he ſuppoſeth that a vaſt Period in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded between that Origination and the Age wherein he lived; and within the compaſs of that Period, that there happened very great and very many viciſſitudes of Floods and Conflagrations in this inferior World, whereby the ſtate of things here was variouſly altered, and the Numbers of Mankind and Animals corrected and reduced at ſeveral times to ſmall proportions, only ſufficient to repleniſh the World, until ſuch time as its Exceſs and Increaſe received again a like Correction or Reduction, by the like Revolutions of Floods and Conflagrations, though ſtill without a total deſtruction of the <hi>Species.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Book he gives us a perſonated Diſcourſe between <hi>Solon</hi> and an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſt, who after ſome diſcourſe of the Antiquity of <hi>Athens,</hi> the Prieſt tells him; <hi>Vos Graeci ſemper pueri eſtis, nec quiſquam è Graecia ſenex, quia juvenis ſemper vobis eſt animus, in quo nulla eſt ex vetuſtatis commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione priſca opinio, nulla cana ſcientia: Nam quod apud vos fertur Phaetontem quondam Solis filium currus aſcendiſſe paternos, nec patris aurigatione ſervata, exuſſiſſe terrena, ipſúmque flammis coeleſtibus conflagraſſe; quamvis fabuloſum videatur, verum quodammodo eſſe putandum est: Fit enim longo temporis inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallo coeleſtis circuitus permutatio quaedam, quam inflammationis vaſtitas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſario ſequitur: tunc hi qui edita incolunt loca magis pereunt quam mari fluviíſque vicini. Nobis prorò Nilus cum in pleriſque rebus nobis ſalutaris eſt,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64147:114"/>
tum hujuſmodi à nobis arcet exitium. Quando verò Dii aquarum colluvione ſordes terrarum diluunt, paſtores ovium atque bubulci qui juga montium habitant, periculum illud evadunt; veſtrae autem civitates in planitie ſitae, impetu flumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ad mare rapiuntur: Sed in noſtra regione neque tunc, neque alias unquam aqua in agros ſupernè deſcendit; contra verò ſurſum è viſceribus terrae ſcaturit: quamobrem antiquiſſimarum rerum apud nos monumenta ſervantur. Proinde, ubicunque nec imbrium tempeſtas nimia, nec incendium ingens contingit, licèt alias plures, alias pauciores, ſemper tamen homines ſunt. Quaecunque verò ſive à noſtris, ſive à veſtris, ſive aliis nationibus geſta ſunt memoratu digna, modo ad aures noſtrorum pervenerunt, noſtris in templis deſcripta ſervantur. Apud vos quidem &amp; alias gentes res gestae nuper literis monumentíſque traduntur, ſed certis temporum curriculis illuvies immenſa coelitus omnia populatur; ideo qui ſuccedunt, &amp; literis &amp; Muſis orbati ſunt: quo fit, ut quaſi juvenes iterum ſitis, &amp; rudes, praeteritarum rerum omnium prorſus ignari. Nam &amp; ea ipſa quae modo ex veſtris hiſtoriis recenſentur, à fabulis puerilibus parum diſtant; primò, quod unius tantum inundationis memineritis, cum multae praeceſſerint; deinde, quod genus majorum veſtrorum in regione veſtra clariſſimum ignoretis: ex quo, tu, &amp; Athenienſes cateri nati eſtis, exiguo ſemine quondam publicae cladi ſuperſtite: quod propterea vos latuit, quia ſuperſtites illi eorúmque poſteri, literarum uſu multis ſeculis caruerunt.</hi> Then he tells him of the Building of <hi>Athens</hi> by the Goddeſs <hi>Athena,</hi> 9000 Years ſince, <hi>ex terra &amp; Vulcano accipiens ſemina:</hi> the great Wars between them and the Inhabitants of the vaſt Iſland <hi>Atlantis,</hi> greater than <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Aſia:</hi> the ſwallowing up of that Iſland by an Earthquake, <hi>Jugíque unius diei &amp; noctis illuvione.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Timaeus</hi> begins, and proceeds with his Narrative touching the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Univerſe, and therein particularly of Mankind, which I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to mention.</p>
               <p>Thus this great Maſter ſeems to countenance the Suppoſition of the viciſſitudes of Conflagrations and Floods, eſpecially of the latter, <hi>certis temporum curriculis;</hi> and thereby the exceſſive multiplication of Mankind corrected, and the viciſſitudes of Arts and Laws interrupted, loſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and repaired: Only he ſuppoſeth <hi>Egypt</hi> free from thoſe Floods and Conflagrations; though it ſeems neceſſary; that if Inundations prevailed in <hi>Greece</hi> and thoſe upper Countries, <hi>Egypt,</hi> that ſeems to lye much lower, could not eaſily eſcape them, though they have no Rain that might occaſion them. But the Prieſt mingles ſome ſtrange and improbable Stories with his Suppoſition of thoſe Viciſſitudes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the Scholar of <hi>Plato</hi> differed much from his Maſter: 1. In his manner of writing, which was much more ſteady and ſevere than the Writings of <hi>Plato,</hi> who mingled Poetical Fancies with the things he delivered, and ſeems very uncertain and unreſolved in moſt things of great importance. 2. In his Poſition; for <hi>Plato</hi> ſeems not to hold at leaſt the Elementary World Eternal, though very Ancient: But <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> following rather the Opinion of <hi>Ocellus Lucanus,</hi> and not being able to digeſt thoſe many difficulties he found in the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the Inception of the World, ſuppoſeth it Eternal, and an eternal conſiſtency in the ſtate it now ſtands; but not without ſome partial, ſucceſſive and periodical Changes in the Elementary World.</p>
               <p>And therefore in this Suppoſition of the ſucceſſive partial Floods or Inundations, and Conflagrations, whereby great Changes happen,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64147:115"/>
and a fair Corrective and Reduction of the Exceſs of Mankind, he much agrees with <hi>Plato.</hi> And he gives us a large and learned Account of his Judgment herein, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Meteor. cap.</hi> 14. in theſe Words; <hi>Eadem terrae loca neque ſemper fluida, neque ſemper arida ſunt, ſed pro fluminum ortu aut defectu, faciem mutant ſuam: Quamobrem diverſitas inter Mare &amp; Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem exiſtit, nec perpetuo alia pro Continenti, alia pro Mari habentur; ſed ubi terra aliquando patuit, mare ſuperfunditur; &amp; ubi nunc mare, terra exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur. Suſpicaríque debemus, haec omnia ita fieri ordine quodam &amp; ambitu; horum autem principium cauſáque exiſtit, quod interiores quoque telluris partes, perinde atque animantium plantarúmque corpora, juventutem atque ſenectutem habeant. Verum iſtis haec per partem ſubire nequaquam contingit, ſed ſimul totum javeneſcat aut ſeneſcat neceſſe eſt: Terrae particulatim hoc idem ob frigus &amp; calorem accidit; haec igitur accreſcere ſimul ac decreſcere propter Solis calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem converſionémque aſſolent.</hi> Then he proceeds to ſhew, how that ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſome parts of the Earth grow mooriſh or watriſh, others dry, where it becomes barren; Fountains and Rivers decay, and ſometimes break out in other places; that this makes Changes in the Sea and Land. <hi>At quia omnis quae circa terram fit generatio non niſi ſucceſſione &amp; tempore, reſpectu vitae noſtrae quam longo, fieri ſolet, iſta nobis haudquaquam adverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus fiunt. Atque prius univerſae gentes intereunt pereúntque, quàm horum mutatio ab initio ad finem uſque memoriâ teneri queat: Maximas itaque celerrimáſque clades praelia advehunt, alias morbi, nonnullas ſterilitates; &amp; hae quaſdam ſtatim magnas, quaſdam lentas adeò, ut talium quoque gentium tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrationes nos lateant, propterea quod alii regionem deſerant, alii eo uſque ſuſtinent, quoad nullam amplius multitudinem alere regio queat. Inter primam igitur noviſſimámque loci derelictionem, tempora interveniant adeò longa par eſt, ut nemo meminiſſe poſſit; imò incolumibus etiamnum hiſoe qui remanſerint, longi temporis injuriâ oblivio irrepſerit. Eodem autem modo latere exiſtiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt quando primùm ſinguli populi, quae permutata eſſent &amp; arida à paluſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus aquoſíſve facta, inhabitare coeperint.</hi> Then he gives Inſtance in <hi>Egypt; Etenim locus ille totáque regio, quae fluminis tantum invectu nata eſt, ſemper aridior fieri videtur:</hi> That all the <hi>Oſtia Nili,</hi> except one, were made by Art, and not by the River: That anciently <hi>Egypt</hi> was no more but the City of <hi>Thebes;</hi> which he proves out of <hi>Homer;</hi> ſhews, that in the time of <hi>Troy</hi> that part of <hi>Greece</hi> inhabited by the <hi>Argivi</hi> was Mariſh, and had but few Inhabitants, but now become fruitful and populous: That part of <hi>Greece</hi> inhabited by the <hi>Miceni</hi> was fruitful and populous, now become barren. <hi>Quod igitur in iſto loco, qui parvus, accidit, hoc idem etiam circa loca magna accidere cenſeamus oportet.</hi> That there is no cauſe to conceive the Sea leſs than formerly; for though ſome places ſometimes covered with Water, are added to the Continent, yet in other places the Sea hath gained upon the Land. <hi>Attamen hujuſce rei cauſa ad mundi gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem haudquaquam referenda; ridiculum enim foret ob parvas brevéſque mutationes Univerſum moveri aſſerere. Porrò, Terrae moles atque magnitudo ad totum Coelum nihil profectò eſt. Verum horum omnium cauſam exiſtimemus oportet, quod ut elapſis certis temporum ſpatiis, inter anni tempora hyems; ita magno quodam circuitu hyems magna, &amp; imbrium exceſſu ſieri ſolet: at hic non ſemper eiſdem in locis efficitur, ſed perinde ut vocatum dilivium quod tempore Dencalionis accidit; etenim hoc circa Graeciam maximè, &amp; eam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimam partem quam antiquam Hellada vocitant, factum eſt, &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>I have mentioned theſe places of theſe Maſters of Learning and Reaſon the more at large, not only becauſe they herein give the ſharpeſt Objections againſt the neceſſity of a Temporary Beginning of Mankind, by applying theſe Suppoſitions as Correctives or Reductions of the exceſs of the Generation of Men and Animals; but alſo they do diſcover herein ſome things that are uſeful in this Inquiry: For Inſtance, 1. It appears hereby that the Inventions of Arts, Sciences, and Laws might be far more ancient than thoſe times that Hiſtorians gave for their Invention: for they might be in other Places or Ages, and either by a ſucceſſive rotation brought from one place to another; or if they were loſt, yet ſucceſſion of Ages might retrive new Diſcoveries of them again. 2. We have a plain detection of the means whereby poſſibly the <hi>American</hi> People might have their deduction from the <hi>Europeans</hi> or <hi>Aſiaticks;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not impoſſible but the Continents might be in ſome Ages or other contiguous, though now disjoyned by the mutations of the ſituations of Seas; though the certain times of thoſe Changes are not tranſmitted by Hiſtory to our Age. 3.

               <p>Thus far concerning theſe Reductives by Inundations and Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations, out of the Princes of the Academical and Peripatetical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers: We ſhall find the like Suppoſitions frequently among the Stoicks, <hi>Seneca</hi> may be an Inſtance for all that Sect, only theſe vary from the former: for although they do with the former admit and inſtance in temporary and partial Inundations by Earthquakes and other Accidents, <hi>de quibus vide Senecam. l.</hi> 3. <hi>Nat.

               <p>I ſhall ſpare mentioning any more to this purpoſe, though many more Inſtances may be given out of the Philoſophers of all Sects, and Poets, as <hi>Ovid</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Only I ſhall ſubjoyn theſe two Inquiries, and ſo conclude this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whence it is that theſe Ancients had theſe Conjectures touching theſe Floods and Conflagarations, ſo as to frame them into an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> either for the Caſtigation of the Exceſſes of Generation, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato;</hi> or to the total Diſſolution thereof, as the <hi>Stoicks;</hi> and the means that wrought this Perſwaſion ſeem to be theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The things that ſeem to prevail with the <hi>Academicks</hi> and <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> for theſe Partial Floods and Conflagrations, ſeem to be thoſe dark and obſcure Hiſtories of the things of that nature which had twice before happened in <hi>Greece:</hi> Namely, for Floods, the Tradition of the <hi>Diluvium Ogygium,</hi> or <hi>Diluvium antiquius,</hi> which is ſuppoſed by Chronology to be under <hi>Ogyges</hi> King of <hi>Attica,</hi> about 1000 Years before the firſt <hi>Olympiad;</hi> about 248 Years before the Flood of <hi>Deucalion</hi> in <hi>Theſſaly;</hi> about 532 after the General Flood in the time of <hi>Noah;</hi> and about the 2951 Year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, and of the World 2187, though there is ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation among the Computations of Chronologers. This was a Partial Flood, as it ſeems, in <hi>Attica,</hi> part of <hi>Greece.</hi> 2. <hi>Diluvium Deucalionis,</hi> which was alſo Partial, and about 248 Years after the former, in the time of <hi>Cecrops</hi> firſt King of <hi>Athens,</hi> or as others, in the time of <hi>Cranaus</hi> his Son: This is that mentioned by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that drowned a great part of <hi>Greece,</hi> only ſome ſaved by <hi>Deucalion</hi> by bringing them to the top of <hi>Parnaſſus:</hi> And out of the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi> touching the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Flood, and the Hiſtory of <hi>Deucalion, Ovid</hi> made up his firſt Book, attracting in a great meaſure to the latter what was written of the former by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for Conflagrations; they had two traditional Conflagrations in and near <hi>Greece,</hi> which might give ſome countenance to this Perſwaſion: namely, 1. That of <hi>Phaeton, Incendium Phaetontis,</hi> which ſeems not to be long after the Flood of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> though much of the Relation thereof, as the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> after them made, was a Poetical Fiction; yet it ſeems it had ſomething of reality in it, as is obſerved by <hi>Plato, ubi ſupra.</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:64147:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. <hi>Idae Incendium,</hi> which was no great buſineſs, but an Eruption of Fire out of the Hill <hi>Ida,</hi> as now in <hi>Etna:</hi> this was about 73 Years after the Flood of <hi>Deucalion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who held Univerſal Inundations and Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations, poſſibly they might have the former of theſe from the Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Relation of the Univerſal Flood of <hi>Noah,</hi> which Relation they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and upon that founded their Suppoſition of the like Inundations; being acquainted with the Hiſtory of the Flood, but not with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that God made never to bring a Flood again. 2. As to that of the Univerſal Conflagration of the World, it ſeems it was a known, ancient and received Tradition among the <hi>Jews</hi> before our Saviour's time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced by him and his Diſciples: This ſeems to be implied in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Enoch, Jude</hi> 14. and by ancient Tradition, either from <hi>Noah</hi> or the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> this Perſwaſion might be Traditionally derived to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and believed by the <hi>Stoicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears by what hath been before tranſcribed, That theſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſuppoſed thoſe Inundations and Conflagrations to be at great diſtances of times, and yet to be in ſome ſort Periodical, and with a kind of ſtated Revolutions. <hi>Plato</hi> ſuppoſeth his Floods to be <hi>certis tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum curriculis: Ariſtotle</hi> ſuppoſeth his Floods to be alſo Periodical, <hi>Haec omnia fieri ordine quodam &amp; ambitu;</hi> and again, <hi>Magno quodam circuitu hyems magna &amp; imbrium exceſſus fiunt,</hi> bearing ſome proportion to our Seaſon of the Solar Year. Therefore it may be fit to conſider what kind of Year this muſt be wherein this <hi>Hyems magna</hi> is ſuppoſed to happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> as before hath given us out of <hi>Beroſus</hi> ſome deſcription of the Periods, namely, when all the Planets ſhall meet in one ſtreight Line drawn from the Center of the Earth to the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> then the great Conflagration ſhall happen; and again, when they meet in the like poſition under the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> then the Univerſal Deluge ſhall happen. So that theſe two Conjunctions divide that <hi>Annus magnus</hi> into two parts, and the Summer-Solſtice thereof ſhall be for Conflagration, the Winter-Solſtice for the Inundation, or that <hi>Magna hyems</hi> which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> hath aſſigned for his Periodical Inundations. But what is that <hi>Magnus annus</hi> wherein theſe Revolutions muſt happen, or what number of Solar Years it contains is uncertain, ſome aſſigning a Period that ſeems too ſhort, ſome a Period of a wonderful length.</p>

is 600 Years; and yet the Flood happened not till 1656 Years from the Creation; which according to the Suppoſition therefore of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Magnus annus,</hi> and that Year the Winter-Solſtice thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſuppoſeth that the <hi>Magnus annus animarum</hi> is 12000 Years, for in that Period the Soul hath run through all the Spheres and Dances of the Gods and <hi>Daemons,</hi> and returns to its firſt Station; and the <hi>Annus magnus mundanus</hi> conſiſts of three of thoſe Periods, namely, 36000 Years, wherein the Soul of the World hath performed its great Circuit, or one Revolution of the eighth Sphere: <hi>vide Marſil. Ficin. prolog. in lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Platonis de Republica:</hi> and then not only all the Heavenly Bodies will be juſt in the ſame poſition in which they were 36000 Years before, but all Humane things will be in the ſame ſtate as they were.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> had their great <hi>Apocataſtaſes; viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Apocataſtaſis die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> which was 1461 Days: 2. <hi>Apocataſtaſis annorum aequabilium,</hi> which was 1461 Years: 3. Their <hi>Apocatastaſis magna,</hi> conſiſting of 25 <hi>Apocata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staſes annorum,</hi> which amounted to 36525 equable Years; which was their <hi>Magnus annus canicularis,</hi> whereunto <hi>Manetho</hi> accommodates his fabulous <hi>Egyptian Dynaſties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There ſeems to be another <hi>Annus magnus, viz.</hi> the Motion of the ninth Sphere or Chryſtallin Heaven, from Weſt to Eaſt; which though ſome to make it agree with the <hi>Magnus annus Platonicus</hi> ſuppoſe to be 1 Degree every 100 Years, in all performing its Revolution in 36000 Years, according to the great <hi>Platonick</hi> Year; yet <hi>Alphonſus</hi> allows a greater number of Years to that Revolution, <hi>viz.</hi> 49000 Years: and others I think more. But I think that we ſhall not be able to fit the Seaſons of this Year to the <hi>Magna hyems Ariſtotelica,</hi> or his Winter-quarter; becauſe 1. We know not whether any of theſe, or any other that can be found, will ſuit with theſe Inſtances upon which it may be thought he grounds his Suppoſition; for the <hi>Incendium Phaetontis</hi> and the Flood of <hi>Deucalion</hi> happened very near one the other, as alſo the <hi>Incendium Idae:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if that Flood of <hi>Deucalion</hi> had faln within the Winter-quarter of any of theſe <hi>Anni magni,</hi> it would have had a longer Influence upon the World, and extended at leaſt ſucceſſively to all the ſeveral Parts thereof. For the Winter-quarter of the <hi>Magnus annus Platonicus,</hi> if it had any thing of proportion to our Seaſons, muſt have been a fourth part of that <hi>Magnus annus;</hi> and then it had laſted above 8000 Years: But howſoever it muſt upon the loweſt Account have laſted a thirty ſixth part, <hi>viz.</hi> 1000 Years; and then the Effects thereof would certainly have been more permanent and extenſive than to one or two Floods in <hi>Greece.</hi> 2. Again, could we know the extent of this <hi>Magnus annus,</hi> yet we can never find the <hi>Caput anni,</hi> when it begins, and conſequently cannot poſſibly aſſign any probable Period for the Seaſons of it; unleſs we ſhall fondly with <hi>Virgil</hi> ſuppoſe it began with the Birth of his Patron <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Son,
<q>Jam redit &amp; virgo, redeunt Saturnia rgna.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:64147:117"/>Again, theſe muſt needs be meerly Conjectures, and can have no poſſible Evidence becauſe meerly depending upon Fact and Experience: it is not poſſible that any Man, or any Age of Men can give us any Account of any one Revolution of this <hi>Magnus annus,</hi> which amounts to 36000 Years.</p>
               <p>Therefore it ſeems difficult, and utterly uncertain to ſuppoſe thoſe Inundations and Conflagrations to be Periodical in any proportion to any ſuppoſed time or duration.</p>
               <p>And thus far touching the urging of this Expedient for the Reduction or Correction of the Exceſſes of the Generations of Men or Animals, by Periodical Floods or Conflagrations; which though the Generations of Men were ſuppoſed Eternal, might Regulate and Reduce their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers when beginning to be immoderate, as our annual Winters correct the excreſcence of Inſects, whoſe multiplication is far more exceſſive than that of Men, and would apppear ſo, if we had a perpetual Summer; yet are reduced to a mediocrity and due equability by the viciſſitudes of Winter Cold and Rain.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. X.</hi> The farther Examination of the precedent Objection.</head>
               <p>I Have been the longer in the Explication and Inforcement of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Objection, becauſe as the neceſſary and ſenſible Multiplication of Mankind upon the face of the Earth by the ordinary courſe of Natural Generation, ſeems to be the moſt ſenſible Evidence of Fact againſt the Eternal Succeſſion of Mankind; ſo the Reductives mentioned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter ſeemed with moſt Evidence of Senſe to weaken the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence upon that Obſervation, and by the Suppoſition of thoſe continual or interpolated Correctives to render the poſſibility of an eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of Propagations of Men, yet without an over-charging of the World with a multitude inconſiſtent with its reception.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now deſcend to the Examination of theſe ſuppoſed Correctives of the exceſs of the number of Mankind, and how far the ſame may be true; or if true, how far the ſame may be, or hath been effectual to that end.</p>
               <p>Wherein, firſt I ſhall ſet down what is to be agreed touching the ſame, and wherein we differ from that Suppoſition of the efficacy, or available<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or accommodation, or ſuitableneſs of theſe Reductives to the end propoſed, namely, to the containing of the Generations of Mankind in ſuch an equability and proportion as may be conſiſtent with an Eternal Succeſſion of them.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe things it muſt be agreed, 1. That there have been great Devaſtations and Decrements of Mankind by all or many of the Means mentioned in the former Chapter, namely, Plagues and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Diſeaſes, Famines, and Sterilities of great parts of the World; Wars and Internecions, not only in Battels and Fights, but even in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64147:118"/>
and Maſſacres, witneſs the great cruelty of the perſecuting Emperours againſt the Chriſtians, the cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> among the <hi>Indians,</hi> the violent bloodſheds of the Papiſts upon the Proteſtants, as the late and former Inſtances abundantly teſtifie: And alſo by Floods and Inundations, eſpecially that Univerſal Deluge in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> which probably did ſweep away as great multitudes of Mankind as are now exiſting upon the Earth, conſidering what a Product might ariſe in the compaſs of 1656 Years, the interval between the Creation and the Flood upon the ſhorteſt Account, though the <hi>Septuagint</hi> render it much longer: and it is not eaſie to judge to what a Sum Mankind might ariſe to in ſuch a Period, conſidering the great longevity of Man's Life in thoſe times; only it is plain that it muſt needs ariſe to a greater proportion than thrice ſo long a Period would yield, when Mens Ages were reduced to leſs than a tenth part of the ſame longevity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is certain, that were it not for ſuch Reductives as theſe above mentioned, though we ſhould ſuppoſe that the <hi>Capita humani generis</hi> were only <hi>Noah</hi> and his three Sons, and that the Generations of Mankind began ſince the Univerſal Flood, yet the multitudes of Mankind would in this Period ſince the Flood have riſen to ſuch an excreſcence, that according to the ordinary method of Propagation (though the Lives of Men were no longer than now they are) that the Earth would not have been able to have received its Inhabitants.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is alſo therefore evident, that the moſt wiſe and glorious God hath uſed theſe Means above mentioned for moſt wiſe and excellent Ends. For it is the high Prerogative and Advantage of his infinite Wiſdom, to bring about complicated and various excellent Ends in one and the ſame act of the diſpenſation of his Providence, by Plagues, Wars, Earthquakes and Floods (all which are at leaſt permitted if not inflicted, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever moſt wiſely and infallibly governed by him) he puniſheth the Sins and Enormities of Mankind, and reduceth the World to ſuch a due proportion as may be conſiſtent with their convenience and reception in this Earth: And for this cauſe, while the World was but thin and empty of Inhabitants, the Ages of Mankind were longer, and more accommodated to the peopling of the World; and as the World grew by that means fuller, ſo their Lives were ſucceſſively reduced to a ſhorter ſcantlet, till they came to that ordinary Age and time of Life which now they have, and for near 4000 Years have held.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore alſo it muſt be granted, that the apparent Multiplication of Mankind upon the face of the Earth ſingly conſidered, is not any Demonſtration or Apodictical Argument againſt the Eternity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: Since, as it is moſt evident, that there is a moſt wiſe and powerful God, who hath a care of the Inferior World as well as the Superior, and whoſe Providence (notwithſtanding the contrary Sentiments of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) reacheth below the Moon, and governs the World with much more Accuracy and Wiſdom than a Gardiner orders his Garden: I ſay, ſince the Regiment of the World, and eſpecially of Mankind, is ſo actually under the Care, Wiſdom, and Power of Almighty God, he that for near 6000 Years by thoſe Methods of his Providence above mentioned hath kept the World of Mankind in a due proportion and equability, which otherwiſe would have grown too great for its reception; could have
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64147:118"/>
interpoſed with the like Correctives for twenty thouſand Years as well as ſix, and for a million or other interminate duration for the time paſt or to come; and ſo have prevented that enormous excreſcence of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that in an infinite time or duration would have long ſince ſurchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the World; and upon a Suppoſition of a future Sempiternity would produce the ſame difficulty, without ſuch interpoſition of the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Providence.</p>
               <p>But all this while it muſt ſtill be remembred, that this Suppoſition ſtill takes in the Wiſdom, Providence and Regiment of the glorious God; for without an intelligent Rector of the World, that <hi>ex intentione</hi> thus orders the Affairs of Mankind, theſe Reductives either barely, as accidental, or contingent, or periodical and neceſſary, were not equal nor competent Reductives of the Generations of Men, but would be too much or too little, or unſeaſonable in time, place, meaſure, or other Circumſtances for ſuch a Buſineſs, as ſhall be ſhewn.</p>
               <p>We therefore are not enquiring what the wiſe and glorious God might or could do in order to the equable Reduction of the World, upon a Suppoſition of an Eternal Duration; but we are upon a Queſtion of Fact indeed, namely, What he hath done, and whether upon the Suppoſition of all thoſe Reductives inſtanced in the former Chapter, at leaſt without the wiſe and intelligent Regiment of God, they have been, or well could be: conſidering the nature and courſe of things of that efficacy to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the increaſe and exceſs of Mankind, that may render it competible with an Eternal Duration.</p>
               <p>I therefore ſhall now come to the things I oppoſe, and they are theſe two; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That theſe Means conſidered ſimply in themſelves (without the Conduct and Guidance and Interpoſition of the mighty God) are in themſelves incompetent and unſuitable to the Ends propoſed: and 2. That <hi>de facto</hi> they have appeared to be ſo; and notwithſtanding their admiſſion, yet <hi>de facto</hi> the World hath in all Ages increaſed.</p>
               <p>Touching the former of theſe, the Incompetency of theſe Expedients to the End propoſed (conſidered ſingly in themſelves) this will beſt appear by induction of particulars.</p>
               <p>For Famines, they are <hi>de facto</hi> incompetent to theſe Ends: for 1. There was never yet known a Univerſal Famine, but the defects of one Country ſupplied by another, as <hi>Canaan</hi> was by <hi>Egypt.</hi> 2. It is ordinarily not ſudden but gradual, and foreſeen before felt in the extremity, which gives People opportunity of tranſmigrations. 3. Though the ordinary ſupplies fail, yet neceſſity makes Men ingenious and hardy, and if they have but Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room or Sea-room, they find ſome ſupplies for their hunger which they did not before think of or uſe; though it be otherwiſe in a cloſe Siege, but that is but a narrow compaſs, and not of moment to be compared to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes abroad.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Plagues are indeed a ſharp and ſpeedy Viſitation, yet it hath theſe Allays: 1. Many there are that are able to eſcape it by Flights, ſome by Phyſick, and ſome by their Age and Complexion. 2. It is not ordinarily of long continuance, the ſtrength of the Diſeaſe ſeldom continuing longer than a Year. 3. Though the Deſolation be terrible while it laſts, yet it rarely conſumes one half of the Inhabitants. The late Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Number of the Inhabitants, Men, Women and Children in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64147:119"/>
the City of <hi>London</hi> and the 16 and 10 Out-Pariſhes are eſtimated at 384000, and about ſix Millions in the whole Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> 2. The greateſt Plagues in our remembrance have not ſwept away above 100000 at moſt in <hi>London</hi> and the Suburbs: Indeed that before mentioned by <hi>Walſingham,</hi> which was in a manner Univerſal, and ſucceſſively in ſeveral places of the World laſted about 15 Years, is ſaid to be ſo great, that ſcarce a tenth part of People ſurvived it; yet if it left a tenth part, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in <hi>England,</hi> it left near a Million of People, which in a little time would and did recover and increaſe conſiderably, as ſhall be ſhewn. 4. Again, ſuppoſe the Devaſtation by Plagues greater than Hiſtory gives us an Account, yet it is for the moſt part a Diſeaſe that reigns in ſome times and ſome places, it may fall in thoſe places where the numbers are already too ſmall, and need an Increaſe. And ſo taken ſingly by it ſelf, is incompetent and unſuitable to the Exceſs, unleſs managed by the wiſe Conduct of Almighty God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Touching Wars and Internecions. It is true, it hath been a great Conſumption of Mankind, but yet it is not an equal Corrective of the Exceſs of Generations: 1. Though ſuch have happened, and frequently, yet they ſeem againſt the nature and diſpoſition of Mankind, ordinarily and in a courſe of Humane Conſtitution: Naturally Mankind is a ſociable Creature, and more than Bees, as the Philoſopher obſerves; and though ſometimes Paſſions, Jealouſies and Politick ends produce Wars, yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Man is not a Creature of prey upon others, as Lions and Tigers are. 2. Ordinarily, though Wars are by one Kingdom or State upon another, yet they preſerve their own Societies with increaſe under Forein Wars; and therefore Civil Wars as they are more deſtructive, ſo they are more rare, becauſe they are more unnatural and deſtructive to that which Men uſually are careful to preſerve, namely, their own Societies. 3. It ſeems an improper and unſuitable Corrective, becauſe Accident and the Wills of Men have ſo great an Influence in the production of Wars; whereby it may fall out that Wars may happen in thoſe Ages, Times or Places, and conſequently, Devaſtations upon them where or when they need not to correct. And though it be true, that a Plethory or Exceſs of Numbers of Men, ſometimes by a kind of Natural or at leaſt Moral Conſequence cauſe Wars, yet we have hardly known any produced ſingly upon that Account; though it hath oftentimes occaſioned Tranſmigrations, deductions of Colonies, and new Plantations; and the World hath been never yet ſo full, but a weaker or oppreſſed Party have ſound room to retreat from the violence or inſolence of their Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Touching Floods and Conflagrations. It is true that Almighty God as he manageth the forementioned Reductives by his Wiſdom and Providence, ſo he hath done theſe eſpecially in that Univerſal Deluge: But as they are inſtanced in by the Philoſophers as Natural or Periodical Events whereby Mankind is reduced to an equability, we have no reaſon to believe them. Therefore I ſay, 1. That there doth not appear, either in Hiſtory or in the Obſervation of Nature, any ſuch Periodical Floods or Conflagrations; thoſe that we have Relations of happened indeed near together, and in the ſame Country, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> had they been Periodical or Natural, probably either by a continued Circulation or Rotation, or
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64147:119"/>
elſe by the interpoſition of ſome reaſonable intervals, the like would have happened before in <hi>Perſia</hi> or ſome Eaſterly parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> or ſince in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> or ſome other Weſtern parts of the World, which we have not obſerved to be. And therefore this Suppoſition of the <hi>Hyems magna,</hi> whereby parts of the Earth ſhould be ſucceſſively drowned, ſeems to be only an Imagination, or at leaſt it cannot be known with any tolerable certainty; in as much as the Periods are ſuppoſed to be vaſt, and not happening within any competent time to give us an Obſervation or Proof thereof. And therefore although we yearly ſee a reduction of the numerous increaſe of Inſects, by the Winter Froſt and Storms yearly happening; we have no warrant from thence to imagin that great Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that muſt make the like reduction of Men and Brutes; for every Year gives us Experience of the one, but never any Age gave us any reaſonable Obſervation, upon which to build an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the like Perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Revolution of the other: and the ſame I ſay touching Conflagrations. Indeed there have been accidental and particular Inſtances of both, but not any Periodical Return or Revolutions thereof, <hi>quaſi in quodam ambitu &amp; circuitu naturali.</hi> 2. If ſuch were ſuppoſed, yet unleſs they were very ſudden, and very general, they would not be ſufficient to make the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: Men would eſcape Floods by running up to Mountains and Hills, and though ſome might periſh through improvidence, or though the ſuddenneſs of a Deluge, many would eſcape. 3. Natural and Periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Floods or Conflagrations would not be ſutable nor commenſurate to the Increaſe, which depending either upon Accidents or the Wills of Men, would poſſibly be more in one place than in another: The Country of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> would be more peopled than the Sands and Deſarts of <hi>Arabia, Egypt</hi> than the Mountains of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and fruitful Countries, or Countries open to Trade, and ſafe from Incurſions and Invaſions; more populous than barren Countries, or ſuch as are out of the way of Trade, or ſubject to Inroads: But Natural and Periodical Floods or Conflagrations would probably keep ſome conſtant or ordinary Tract or Courſe, either from Eaſt to Weſt, or from North to South; and poſſibly keeping in ſuch a Climate or Latitude, poſſibly in another; whereby poſſibly theſe Plagues might be more fierce in thoſe places or Continents where the World wants People, and leſs vehement in thoſe places where there needs a Corrective for their exceſs: If theſe ſhould be Univerſal, they would deſtroy the Race of Mankind; if Partial, they would be perchance weak and inſignificant Reductives of the exceſs of Mankind.</p>
               <p>When all therefore is done, though it be plain that theſe and the like Calamities are certain Reductives of the exceſs of Mankind, yet they are incompetent of themſelves, and upon a bare Suppoſition of Natural or Accidental Effects. But it is true, as they are either brought and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, or managed and governed by a moſt wiſe and intelligent Being, they are uſeful, and wiſely applied to this End among others.</p>
               <p>But in the whole management and conduct of theſe Events and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences whereby Mankind hath been reduced and corrected, we ſhall obſerve very eaſily that Mankind hath ſtill increaſed, and the World grown fuller, even to manifeſt Senſe and Experience, which was the ſecond thing I propoſe to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore I do affirm, That notwithſtanding all theſe Ordinary
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64147:120"/>
and Extraordinary Occurrences that have afflicted Mankind, as ſhortneſs of Life, divers Caſualties and common Diſeaſes, loſs of Men by Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Intemperance and Luxury of Mankind, the Weakneſſes and deſtructive Sickneſſes incident eſpecially to Infancy, Childhood, and Youth, Abortions voluntary or accidental, and all thoſe ordinary Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incident to our nature. And notwithſtanding alſo thoſe great and vaſt Conſumptions by Famine, by Peſtilence, by ſtrange and Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſeaſes, by Wars and Battels, Sea-fights, Internecions, Maſſacres and Perſecutions, Earthquakes, Floods, Inundations, Conflagrations, or what other extraordinary or terrible and univerſal Accidents that have happened to Mankind in any or all the Ages paſt ſince the Flood of <hi>Noah;</hi> Mankind hath notwithſtanding all theſe increaſed and grown fuller, the Generations of Mankind have exceeded their Decays.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this is an Aſſertion of Fact, it is impoſſible to be made out but by Inſtances of Fact.</p>
               <p>And although it be impoſſible for any Man to give an Account of all the Nations of the World collectively, and ſo to make out the Fact; yet if the Inſtance can be made out in one or two Nations, whereof a true and clear Account may be given, it will be more than a common probability that the ſame may be concluded concerning the generality of Mankind.</p>
               <p>And therefore I ſhall ſingle out the Inſtances of two Nations, touching whom the cleareſt Account of their Original and Increaſe may be given, and ſuch alſo as had as great an Experience of the ſevereſt of theſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectives, and poſſibly much greater than any determinate People or Nation in the World beſides.</p>
               <p>The firſt Inſtance I ſhall give is the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and I chooſe this People for my Inſtance, 1. Becauſe their firſt Original, and the time wherein it began is moſt clearly, evidently, and unqueſtionably known, and the time wherein it was. 2. Becauſe their ſeveral Increaſes and Abatements and Succeſſions, with the ſeveral times thereof, even down to the laſt Diſſolution of their City under <hi>Titus,</hi> is moſt clearly by a continued Hiſtory plainly and authentically diſcovered. 3. Becauſe by the ſtrange and admirable Providence of God, even ſince the Diſſolution of their State and Republick they have been to this day continued a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated People from the reſt of the World; notwithſtanding their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable diſperſion among all Nations, among whom they have yet remained diſtinct as a ſignal Monument of the Divine Truth and Juſtice, and for what other ſecret ends and purpoſes, is beſt known to the Divine Wiſdom. 4. Becauſe this People hath been in all Ages exerciſed with as many Plagues and Slaughters and Devaſtations of all ſorts, as ever any People under Heaven were. And 5. Becauſe the particulars of theſe Devaſtations, and the ſeveral Times and Ages wherein they happened, and oftentimes the Numbers cut off thereby are Recorded by the ſeveral Authentical Hiſtories of that People, which are extant to this day. And 6. Becauſe their Increaſe even at this day, as in their ſeveral ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Periods, is ſignal and evident to all the World. So that what is verified touching the Increaſe of that People, may in all congruity of Reaſon be aſſumed and determined much more touching any other People, and all the People in the World: ſince none had ever greater Inſtances
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64147:120"/>
of Abatements or Correctives of the Exceſs of their Number than this People. Laſtly, Becauſe there can be no pretence that their decays or diminutions by thoſe Occurrences were ſupplied by the acceſſion and conjunction of others of other Nations to them: Since it was their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in which they gloried, and which they ſtrictly and religiouſly obſerved, To keep themſelves ſeparate and diſtinct from the reſt of Mankind.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not be ſcrupulous or curious in the Chronological niceties touching their ſeveral Periods, becauſe in this and other Computations that I have uſed I do not aim at curious or preciſe Computations, but only to ſhew the Order and <hi>Series</hi> of Things for the diſcovery of what I intend; and therefore ſhall take the Account of <hi>Helvicus,</hi> as being plaineſt and readieſt at hand for my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca</hi> were the two next immediate Parents of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Eſau</hi> and the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year of the World 2108 were <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> Born: I ſhall leave the Families of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and carry down that of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year of the World 2238 <hi>Jacob</hi> goes down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> having then 70 Perſons deſcended from him; which Increaſe was in the compaſs of about 130 Years after the Birth of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and about 70 Years after his Marriage with <hi>Leah. Gen.</hi> 46.27.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> increaſe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet not without a great deſtruction of them by their ſevere Bondage, and by the Slaughter of their Males. <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>In the Year of the World 2453 the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was about 215 Years after the going down of <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a ſhort time after the Migration of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> they were numbred, and the Number of their Males that were above 20 Years old then amounted to Six hundred and three thouſand, five hundred and fifty, beſides the <hi>Levites;</hi> from a Month old amounting to 22000. <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.46. and 2.32. and 3.39. and if we ſhould take into the number of the Eleven Tribes Women, and Children under 20 Years old, we ſhould reaſonably have more than triple the number, <hi>viz.</hi> above two Millions.</p>
               <p>From this time to the time of <hi>Phinehas</hi> we have no certain eſtimate of their Numbers, yet in this Interval they had very great Abatements and Diminutions, as will appear by theſe Inſtances.</p>
               <p>That all this number of People above 20 Years old, except <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> died in the compaſs of their 40 Years wandering in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Num.</hi> 26.65. yet ſome of them could not exceed 60 Years of age.</p>
               <p>Of the Plague 34000 in the Wilderneſs, beſides the Complices of <hi>Corah: Numb.</hi> 16.49. and 25.49. beſides thoſe that died of Fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>After the death of all that were before numbred, they were again numbred all except the <hi>Levites;</hi> and the Number of all the Males from 20 Years old and upwards, were Six hundred and one thouſand, ſeven hundred and thirty: among theſe was the Land after divided by <hi>Joſhua. Numb.</hi> 26.51, 53.</p>
               <p>I do not remember any Numeration of the People from this time till the time of King <hi>David,</hi> and in that Interval that People ſuffered very great detriments.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:64147:121"/>1. By the Wars with the <hi>Canaanites</hi> under <hi>Joſhua,</hi> wherein though they were victorious, yet it could not be without great loſs of Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After this they endured in the time of the Judges great diminutions under the Kings of <hi>Meſopotamia, Canaan,</hi> the <hi>Midianites,</hi> the <hi>Philistims,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> beſides about 65000 Men ſlain in the Civil Wars with the <hi>Benjamites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Wars in the time of <hi>Saul,</hi> wherein though he was often victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, yet at laſt he ſuffered a great Slaughter by the <hi>Philiſtims.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Wars of <hi>David,</hi> both with Foreiners and the Rebellious in his own Kingdom; wherein though he were victorious, yet thoſe Victories could not be obtained without great Loſſes: In the Buſineſs of <hi>Abſalom</hi> 40000 of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſlain and loſt in one Battel, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.7. in the latter end of the Reign of <hi>David,</hi> about the Year of the World 2925, which was 435 Years after the Numbring of the People by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eleazar, David</hi> again Numbers the People, and then the Account of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was 800000 valiant Men that drew the Sword, and of <hi>Judah</hi> 500000 valiant Men, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.9. in all 1300000 fighting Men: and if we ſhould take in Women, Children, and Aged, it is probable they were above five Millions.</p>
               <p>So that in the ſpace of 435 Years, notwithſtanding all theſe Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they were increaſed about three Millions.</p>
               <p>The next Account of the Numbers of the Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> only under <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.14. and though in the interval between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> theſe two Tribes received conſiderable Allays by Wars, Plagues, and Famines, yet the Number of the mighty Men of valour of <hi>Benjamin</hi> was 380000, and of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> 780000 mighty Men of valour. The Increaſe of <hi>Judah</hi> between that and <hi>David</hi>'s Numeration was 280000 fighting Men; and therefore the Increaſe of Women, Children, and Aged not fit for War, muſt needs be much greater and more conſiderable; and yet this was in a Period only of thoſe Years that intervened between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jehoſaphat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this the ten Tribes were carried away Captives by <hi>Salmanaſſer,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. and only <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> remained: ſo that now all our Account muſt run upon theſe two Tribes, the reſt being carried away, and probably confounded and mingled among the Gentiles. And if we conſider what Calamities theſe two Tribes endured by Wars and Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities from the time of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> until their deportation into <hi>Babylon,</hi> we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that they had as great a Reduction as ordinarily could befall a People: <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> carried Captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably was the iſſue of ſome great Siege or Battel; <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſlain in Battel by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt; Jeruſalem</hi> taken by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of <hi>Jehojachim,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.12. again in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the City again beſieged, and after two Years Siege and great Famine and Slaughter, taken. <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.12.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſevere Adminiſtrations of War could not be without great Deſolations, Slaughters and Mortalities, though their Number is not recorded.</p>
               <p>The People were carried away Captive to <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Year of the World 3362 or thereabouts, which was about 437 Years after the Reign of <hi>David;</hi> ſeventy Years after the Captivity, <hi>viz.</hi> about the Year of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64147:121"/>
the World 3420, there was a Return of the <hi>Jews</hi> under <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Partial Remigrations for ſome time after.</p>
               <p>The numbers of thoſe that returned firſt with <hi>Ezra</hi> were 42360, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.64. this ſeems to be the greateſt number: there were other Remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations in the time of <hi>Darius,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> both in the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year, though the certain number be not mentioned. We will therefore take ſcope enough, and ſuppoſe them in all 100000 Perſons, which is more than double to thoſe that came up with <hi>Ezra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe continued in a troubled condition from the time of the ceſſation of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy until the time of Chriſt, and rarely without Wars, as the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> gives us an account; eſpecially under <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who made great ſlaughter of them.</p>
               <p>After that, <hi>Pompey</hi> by Arms took <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and ſubdued <hi>Syria</hi> in general, not without great bloodſhed; and as they were naturally an unquiet People, ſo the Hiſtories tell us that the <hi>Romans</hi> and their Governours exerciſed great ſeverity and bloodſhed among them.</p>
               <p>And yet for all theſe Correctives and Decrements of this unquiet People, <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that <hi>Nero</hi> willing to take ſome Account and Eſtimate of them by their great convention and concourſe in their <hi>Paſchal</hi> Solemnity, found their number to be Seven and twenty hundred thouſand Perſons, <hi>Joſeph. de Bello Judaico, l.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 968. where Strangers might not be mingled with them in that Solemnity.</p>
               <p>The Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> under <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> is ſuppoſed to be under the 66<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year after the Birth of Chriſt, about the Year of the World 4006 which was about 586 Years after the Return under <hi>Cyrus: Joſephus</hi> gives us an Account of thoſe that were ſlain at the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem, viz.</hi> 110000, and Priſoners taken 90000, <hi>Joſeph. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap. penult.</hi> beſides the multitudes ſlain in <hi>Cyrene, Alexandria,</hi> and other places not eaſie to be remembred.</p>
               <p>By which we may reaſonably conclude, That in the Period of about 600 Years this Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> increaſed to 27 times more than when they returned under <hi>Cyrus;</hi> for then we allow the number of them that returned to be 100000, but now they were increaſed to 2700000.</p>
               <p>It is true, ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> eſcaped this Slaughter and Captivity, ſuppoſe we the number of thoſe that eſcaped were a Million of <hi>Jews,</hi> ſuch I mean as held rigorouſly to their <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law; for many became Chriſtians, and left much of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtrictneſs, and poſſibly mingled with other Nations.</p>
               <p>But if we ſhould now examin the multitude of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> we ſhall find vaſt numbers of them in all the Trading Cities' and Countries except <hi>England, France, Spain, Portugal, Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> from whence they were formerly baniſhed; yet even in thoſe Countries from whence they have been baniſhed, they are in great numbers, but yet under the diſguiſe of other Names and Nations: But if all the <hi>Jews</hi> (I mean thoſe deſcended from the <hi>Reduces captivitatis Babylonicae</hi>) which are in <hi>Germany, Bohemia, Poland, Lituania, Ruſſia, Venice, Rome</hi> and other parts of <hi>Italy;</hi> in the Dominions of the <hi>Turks, Perſia, Arabia, India, Africa,</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> and other parts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were collected into one Body, they would exceed in number any one of the greateſt Nations of the World, and yield an irreſiſtible Army, if they had Weapons and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64147:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Courage in any meaſure proportionable to their Wealth, Craft, Subtilty, and Numbers.</p>
               <p>So that notwithſtanding all the Abatements and Decrements they have had by Wars, Oppreſſions and Internecions, Plagues, Famines, and other Calamities, we find the Product of one Nation derived from only two Perſons, <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca,</hi> in the compaſs of about 5000 Years ſwoln into incredible numbers of Millions of Perſons now exiſting, and known to be of that Linage and Deſcent, and ſtill continuing unqueſtionably in that Diſtinction, beſides thoſe multitudes derived from the Line of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the ten Tribes, which are as it were leſt and confounded, without any diſtinction among other Nations. And thus far of the firſt Inſtance, concerning the Multiplication of the Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Inſtance that I ſhall give ſhall be nearer home; the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> I ſhall not give any Inſtance touching it before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, becauſe thoſe times are dark, and beſides, the Viciſſitudes and Succeſſions of various Nations in this Kingdom renders the diſcovery of the Progreſs of Generations of Men, or the Increaſes thereof, difficult; as <hi>Britons, Romans, Picts, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ancient Inhabitants were the <hi>Britons,</hi> the Body of which People hath been in a great meaſure ſhut up and contained within the Country of <hi>Wales;</hi> but what by the tranſplanting of many of the <hi>Welſh</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by tranſplanting of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> into <hi>Wales,</hi> it is not poſſible to ſay that all the <hi>Britons</hi> are confined to the Country of <hi>Wales,</hi> or that none but <hi>Britons</hi> are there: and therefore there can be no particular or evident Concluſion made touching their Increaſe or Multiplication. But I ſhall take a ſhorter Period or Compaſs of Time, namely, the laſt 600 Years or thereabouts ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>And although it may be true, that many Perſons of Forein Countries have come into <hi>England</hi> and planted themſelves here, ſo that the whole Increaſe of this Kingdom cannot be ſingly attributed to thoſe that were either Natives, or ſuch as came in with the Conquerour, but many <hi>Scotc<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, Iriſh, Dutch,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>French,</hi> either by Naturalizations or Tranſmigrations have increaſed the Inhabitants of this Iſland; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that probably the Migrations of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> into <hi>Scotland, Holland, France</hi> and other Countries, have made amends for their Migrations hither: We may make a reaſonable Conjecture, that the Deſcendents from thoſe that inhabited this Kingdom in the time of the Conquerour, have increaſed exceedingly above what they were in that time.</p>
               <p>And the Evidence thereof is this: King <hi>William</hi> the Firſt, after his Victory over <hi>Herald,</hi> did in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of his Reign over <hi>England</hi> caule a Survey to be made of all the Cities, Towns, Mannors and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited Lands in <hi>England, Northumberland, Cumberland, Durham</hi> and <hi>North-Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Survey was finiſhed in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of his Reign, and the Book it ſelf preſerved to this Day among the Records of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> not only a Tranſcript or Copy, but the very Original Book it ſelf, and is called <hi>Doomſday:</hi> In this Book are entred the Names of the Mannors or inhabited Townſhips, Boroughs and Cities, and the Owner of them, the Number of Plough-Lands that each contains, and the Number of the Inhabitants upon them, under the ſeveral Names appropriate to thoſe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64147:122"/>
Places: As for Inſtance, <hi>Ibi</hi> 12 <hi>Burgenſes,</hi> 5 <hi>Villani,</hi> 5 <hi>Bordarii,</hi> 5 <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivi,</hi> 5 <hi>Radiminches,</hi> 5 <hi>Cotterelli;</hi> and the like, according to the quality or condition of the Inhabitants: So that this Book in effect gives an Account not only of the Manurable Lands in every Mannor, Town, or Vill, but alſo of the Number and Natures of their ſeveral Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
               <p>To make a Calculation of the Number of Plough-Lands and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants through all <hi>England,</hi> as they are recorded, and to make therewith a Compariſon unto the preſent State and Number of Inhabitants at this Day throughout <hi>England,</hi> is a laborious piece of work, but it is not difficult to be done in any one County; I have tryed the Compariſon in the County of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> through ſome great Boroughs, as <hi>Glouceſter</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Thornbury, Tetbury</hi> and other places, and in effect through the whole County; and I do find,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are very many more Vills and Hamlets now than there were then, and very few Villages, Towns or Pariſhes then, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue not to this Day; but now there are as many as then, and many more. The 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 9 <hi>E.</hi> 2. there iſſued Writs to the Sheriffs of the ſeveral Counties, to return the Names of the ſeveral Vills and Land-Owners in their ſeveral Bayliwicks, which was accordingly done, and remains of Record in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> under the ſtile of <hi>Nomina Villarum;</hi> and the Sum of the Vills of <hi>Gloucesterſhire,</hi> together with the five Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs of <hi>Glouceſter, Briſtol, Berkley, Durſly,</hi> and <hi>Newenham</hi> amounted to 234, which I take it are more than are in <hi>Doomſday,</hi> and yet not ſo many as are at this day; and thoſe that continue to this day, are far more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than they were at the taking of either of thoſe Surveys.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is much more Tillage, and more Plough-Lands now than there were then; which happens by the reduction of many great Waſts and Commons into Tillage, or Meadow, or Paſture, which then were only Waſts, and therefore not particularly ſurveyed becauſe of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Value, and not taken notice of in that Survey.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the number of Inhabitants now are above twenty times more than they were at that time, as well in particular Towns, Boroughs, and Mannors, as in the general extent of the County; and yet that Survey, even as to the number and quality of thoſe that reſided in thoſe Towns or Mannors, at leaſt as Houſholders, is very preciſe and particular: I have not yet made an exact particular Calculation of the Number re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in that Book through the whole County, but I will give a few Inſtances of particular Towns, which may give an eſtimate touching the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glouceſter</hi> is now a very great and populous City, formerly before the time of <hi>H.</hi> 8. a Borough: In the Survey of <hi>Doomſday</hi> it is ſurveyed diſtinct from the <hi>Bertun</hi> of <hi>Glouc':</hi> the groſs of the Borough is ſurveyed together in the beginning of the County, but there are ſome other particular Burgages thereof mentioned under the Titles of particular Mens Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions; as, <hi>Terra Rogeri de Lacy, Terra Elnuffi de Heſding, &amp;c.</hi> The whole concretion of the City of <hi>Gloucester</hi> conſiſts partly of what was the ancient Borough, partly of acceſſions from the Mannors or Villages adjacent, as <hi>Barton</hi> and ſome others: I ſhall therefore caſt up the whole Number of all that were in <hi>Gloc'</hi> or <hi>Barton.</hi>

                  <hi>Thornbury,</hi> with the Hamlets thereunto belonging: the Account of <hi>Doomſday</hi> is of 105 Families of all ſores; there is now near ſix times ſo many.</p>

                  <hi>Aderly,</hi> a little Village at the time of making of that Survey, conſiſting not of above 17 Families of all ſorts; now above twice as many.</p>
               <p>The like Inſtances might be produced, with the like evidence of very great Increaſes in the Towns of <hi>Cirenceſter, Minchin, Hampton, Teuxbury, Campden, Winchcomb, Avening, Weſtbury</hi> near <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and generally through the whole County of <hi>Glouceſter;</hi> which I do not without juſt reaſon ſuppoſe hath more than twenty times the Inhabitants which it had at the time of the coming in of <hi>William</hi> the Firſt, which is not now above 604 Years ſince.</p>
               <p>And if we ſhould inſtitute a later Compariſon, <hi>viz.</hi> between the preſent time and the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which is not above 112 Years ſince, and compare the numbers of Trained Souldiers then and now, the number of Subſidy-men then and now, they will eaſily give us an Account of a very great Increaſe and Multiplication of People within this Kingdom, even to admiration.</p>
               <p>And let any man but conſider the Increaſe of <hi>London</hi> within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of 40 or 50 Years, we ſhall according to the Obſervations framed to my hands find, That the In-Pariſhes until the late Fire in that time have increaſed from 9 to 10, or a 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part; and that the 16 Out-Pariſhes have in that time increaſed from 7 to 12, and yet without any decrement or decay of the reſt of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>By which, and infinite undeniable Inſtances that might be given, it is apparent, that within the compaſs of the laſt 600 Years this Kingdom hath increaſed mightily in its number of Native Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>And yet it is moſt apparent, that it hath had as great Allays and Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Multiplication of Mankind in it, as any Kingdom in the World. For Inſtance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the nature of its Situation, which is all Maritim, and conſiſts much in Navigation, which exhauſts abundance of People by Diſeaſes and Caſualties at Sea.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath been as often viſited with ſore Peſtilences, Epidemical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and Mortality by reaſon thereof, as any Country: the experience of the laſt 60 Years gives us abundance of Inſtances thereof, and former Ages were as frequently viſited in this kind as later.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Forein Wars, both at Sea and Land, have devoured great multitudes of our Inhabitants; as thoſe formerly with <hi>Scotland, France, Spain,</hi> and lately with the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and <hi>French.</hi>

No Kingdom in <hi>Europe</hi> hath had greater Experience of Civil Wars, nor greater Conſumption of Men thereby, than <hi>England</hi> hath had ſince the time of <hi>William</hi> the Firſt: For not to inſtance in our Wars with the <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> let any man read but the Hiſtories of the Wars here in <hi>England</hi> between King Stephen, and <hi>H.</hi> 1. and his Mother, King <hi>John</hi> and his Nobles, King <hi>H.</hi> 3. and the Nobility; between King <hi>E.</hi> 2. and the Earls of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Mortimer;</hi> the Wars between the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and their Partizans, from the time of <hi>H.</hi> 4. unto the

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us alſo conſider the vaſt Evacuations of Men that <hi>England</hi> hath had by Forein Aſſiſtances lent to Forein Kingdoms and States, by Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers and Auxiliaries; as, to <hi>Scotland</hi> in the late Queens time, to <hi>France,</hi> to the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> to <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. To theſe alſo add the vaſt numbers of Men that have tranſplanted themſelves not only into <hi>France, Holland,</hi> and our neighbour Nations, but alſo to <hi>Virginia, Maryland, New England, Barbadoes, Bermudas,</hi> to <hi>Amboyna</hi> and other places in the <hi>Eaſt India,</hi> and laſtly, into <hi>Jamaica;</hi> we ſhall find upon theſe and other Accounts, that <hi>England,</hi> hath had as great Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives of the Exceſſes of their Generations within theſe laſt 600 Years, as any People in the World.</p>
               <p>Add to theſe the great Famines and Peſtilences which have happened within the compaſs of 600 Years, recorded in Hiſtory, and obvious to our own Experience.</p>
               <p>And therefore, if notwithſtanding all theſe Correctives the number of Men have continually increaſed, and that in ſo vaſt and obſervable a degree above their decreaſe; we have as much reaſon to conclude a parity in the reſt of Mankind: and poſſibly were we as well acquainted with the Concerns of other Kingdoms or States, eſpecially of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the Inſtances of this Increaſe would he as much, and poſſibly more conſpicuous than among us.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter therefore I conclude, That as the Correctives inſtanced in the laſt Chapter are not in themſelves likely to be ſufficient and ſutable to the Reduction of the Increaſe of Mankind to an Equability, eſpecially in an infinite ſucceſſion of Eternal Generations: So by plain Experience it is apparent and ſenſible, that <hi>de facto</hi> they have not done it in a finite limit of Ages; but Mankind have notwithſtanding them increaſed every Age, and the multitude of them that are born and live, over-ballance the number of them that dye, <hi>communibus annis;</hi> or being taken upon a <hi>medium,</hi> though poſſibly ſome one Year gave the advantage of Number to the Deſcendents, yet it is not common nor ordinary, but more than two or three Years for one give the advantage of Number to them that are born and live.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. XI.</hi> The Conſequence and Illation upon the Premiſſes, againſt the Eternity of Mankind.</head>
               <p>THe great Aſſertors of the Eternity of the World and of Mankind, have certainly gathered their Opinion principally from this, That they find that Mankind is propagated by ordinary courſe of Generation,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64147:124"/>
and this they ſee by Experience: And as they do ſo now, ſo they did a hundred or a thouſand Years ſince, and as far as thoſe Hiſtories they credit give them account, it was ſo in thoſe times, and in the times before them, as far as Tradition could inſtruct them. And although thoſe various Occurrences of Wars, Peſtilences, Migrations, Floods, Changes of Religion and Languages have obſcured the Hiſtories, Relations and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of former times before thoſe Hiſtories that are extant; yet they think it becomes them, as reaſonable Men, to believe that things have been always ſo as now they are; and that it were a fondneſs to ſuppoſe or believe things to be otherwiſe than they have appeared in the tract of all Times or Ages.</p>
               <p>And upon the ſame ground that theſe Men aſſert the Eternity of the World, the Inſtance and Argument now produced of the plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Increaſe of the numbers of Men upon the face of the Earth, ſeems much more forcibly to conclude againſt that ſuppoſed Eternity of Mankind. For it is plain and evident to Senſe, that the World grows every day fuller than formerly, notwithſtanding all thoſe Correctives and Reductives thereof: And we have reaſon to think it is ſo in all places, at leaſt one with another, and in all Ages, and among all People as we find it in <hi>England</hi> for theſe 600 Years, or among the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> for above 2000 Years: For among theſe People, and in theſe Periods of Time there have been as many and as great Diminutions and Abatements as ever were in ſuch Periods of Time: and yet though perchance in one Age they have diminiſhed, yet they have not been ſo diminiſhed, but that in the compaſs of four or five hundred Years their Increaſe above what they were before ſuch Diminution, is upon a <hi>medium</hi> always exceeding their Decay.</p>
               <p>And ſince we have reaſon to believe what we ſee, namely, the Exceſs of Generations above their Decays, we have reaſon to believe it was ſo always; and if it were ſo always, it is not poſſible the Generations of Mankind could be eternal.</p>
               <p>For if we ſhould ſuppoſe the Eternity of the World, an Increaſe of but one Man in the Period of Millions of Years would have filled more ſpace than all the Earth or the Concave of Heaven could receive: For in as much as in a Duration that never had a Beginning there muſt needs be infinite Millions of Years, the Increaſe of one Man in every Million above what was before, muſt needs produce an infinite coexiſting number, and an infinite <hi>moles</hi> of Mankind; much more if the Increaſe were in any meaſure proportionable to what our daily Experiences give us Inſtances of. Whereby we find, that although it be poſſible that ſeveral Families may be wholly extinct in a Kingdom in the Period of 5 or 600 Years, and though poſſibly in ſome one Age there may be a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the People of a Kingdom from what they were in the Age before; yet in the ſucceſſion of a very few Ages they again increaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the diminution, and neither ſucceſſively decreaſe, nor hold an equality; which we may reaſonably ſuppoſe to be the common condition of the World.</p>
               <p>And as to that Suppoſition, That even upon a Natural account, when the World grows too full of Inhabitants, they muſt break the Bonds of Society and Peace, and ſo diminiſh each other by Internecions and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64147:125"/>
Wars. As Air compreſſed, or expanded beyond the meaſure of the Veſſel containing it, breaks the Veſſel wherein it is compreſſed to give it ſelf room. I ſhall only ſay, that although the Pride and Ambition and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of neighbouring Princes or People, or the ſenſe of too much Oppreſſion and Hardſhip hath many times raiſed Wars, yet we never knew Wars to grow meerly upon the account of the Fulneſs of any Country: indeed that Plethory hath many times occaſioned Emigrations, and Tranſplantations, and Navigation, and increaſe of Trade or Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures and other induſtrious Employments; but Wars have always grown upon other Occaſions: though, as I before obſerve, the great, wiſe, and intellectual Governour of the World hath by his over-ruling Conduct of the Paſſions of Men, brought about ends for the convenience and benefit of Mankind in this reſpect alſo, as well as to puniſh their Exceſſes and Enormities.</p>

               <p>Thus it ſeems there hath been in all Nations, that have had any manner of Order among them, a common Opinion of the Origination of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; though they have dreſſed up the Suppoſition with various Fictions
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64147:126"/>
and Imaginations no leſs vain than the Poets, who ſuppoſed Men to grow of the Serpents Teeth ſown by <hi>Cadmus,</hi> or the Stones thrown over their Heads by <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This perſwaſion and opinion of Mankind of their Original, might be conveyed to the generality of Nations by ſome of theſe ways:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By ſome Tradition, derived down unto them from thoſe that lived before them; but then if we look after the original or firſt head of this Tradition, it may be hard poſitively to define from whence it began; but it ſeems probable, that it was from thoſe firſt Parents of Mankind, and ſo the Tradition founded in the Truth of the Fact, and originally delivered by them that perfectly knew it to be ſo: It is true, there are, and have been very many things entertained as true by Traditional Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which either have not any ſufficient evidence of their Truth, or it may be ſome things that do oppoſe the credit of it; and it were a piece of vain credulity to believe every thing, that either vulgar Tradition, or the Artifices of Men, have impoſed upon over credulous ſucceeding Ages and Perſons: And we ſee, that as the Origination of Man hath been traditionally received, ſo thoſe Adjuncts and Fables with which it hath been dreſſed up, have been alſo received and believed with it. But to this I ſay:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Origination of Man, as a Matter of Fact, could hardly be thought of, but either by very conſidering and thinking Men, whereof hereafter; or by ſuch, as being the firſt Parents of Mankind, knew their Original. And if it be ſaid, they could no more know their Original than a Child new born: It is true, if the Production of Mankind were ſuch at firſt as it is now, or as ſome of the miſtaken Heathen thought it, <hi>(viz. in Infantia)</hi> it may be ſo: But we ſhall ſee, that if Mankind had their Original <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> (as moſt certainly they had) then the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Mankind was in his full and perfect Conſtitution, and not by a gradual progreſs from Infancy as now.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Tradition of the Origination of Mankind ſeems to be univerſal, but the particular Modes or Methods of that Origination, excogitated by the Heathen, were particular, and not common; and therefore, though theſe be fabulous and deſerve not our credit, yet they do not abate the credibility of the univerſal Tradition. The common Tradition and conſent thereunto of the Exiſtence of a Deity, carries in it a great moral Evidence of the Truth thereof, although the particular ſuperadditions and multiplications of Deities, by the Fancies and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of particular Ages or Nations, are fabulous and untrue: <hi>Quod ab omnibus ubique &amp; ſemper creditum eſt pro veritate habendum eſt,</hi> though the various particular Modes, and Methods, and <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> are or may be fabulous.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Mankind had an Original might be known naturally, and without a Revelation to the firſt Individuals of Humane Nature, and conſequently might with evidence and certainty enough, even upon a moral account, be communicated by them to others, and to paſs into an univerſal Tradition: But the Manner of the firſt Production of Men, what gradations were antecedent to it could not poſſibly be known to the firſt Parents of Mankind without Divine Revelation, becauſe it muſt needs be antecedent to their Being, and therefore the particular Manner.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64147:126"/>
therefore could not, upon a bare natural or moral account, be any true Root or Foundation of ſuch a Tradition as according to the <hi>Moſaical Hypotheſis</hi> of the Origination of Mankind, whereby we underſtand that <hi>Adam</hi> was created out of the Duſt of the Ground, and then had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Soul put into him; <hi>Adam</hi> might upon a natural account know that now he was, and that before he was not; and he might upon a rational account know, that ſuch a Production of ſuch a Being as he found himſelf to be, could never have been effected without the agency of a moſt powerful and wiſe Being, which we call Almighty God: And this Tradition, both that he was made when before he was not, and that he was created or made by Almighty God, he might with as great evidence and certainty traditionally communicate to his Deſcendents, as any other matter of fact, or rational deduction: But he could never know the manner of his own Production, or the particular Preparations ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to ſuch his Being, without Revelation from God, or ſome intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Being that ſaw or knew the antecedents to his Conſtitution; neither could he without ſuch Revelation or Diſcovery, deliver the ſame over traditionally with any certainty of truth to his Deſcendents. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the general Tradition of his Origination hath a Rode of Credibility in it, to ſuch a Man as will believe that any matter of Fact may be true that he ſees not; though the particular manner of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is not with any certainty credible to him, that either believes not there is any Divine Revelation, or that believes not the particular Method propounded is in truth a Divine Revelation</p>
               <p>So that the general Tradition that Man had his Origination <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> is a greater Evidence that it was true, than that he was made out of Arrows ſtuck in the Ground; or, <hi>ex folliculis terrae innaſcentibus,</hi> as ſome Philoſophers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Ground of this Perſwaſion hath ſprung from ſuch of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and other conſiderate Men, who upon a ſtrict Enquiry and Examination have found it impoſſible that the ſucceſſive Generations of Mankind could be Eternal, and conſequently Infinite; and therefore have concluded with very great evidence of Reaſon, that it muſt needs have ſome other Origination in ſome one Period of duration, than what is now natural and common. But then being deſtitute of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or at leaſt not giving due credit thereunto, and being greatly in the dark, and not knowing well how to determin what that Method of the Origination of Mankind ſhould be, ſome took up one Fancy, ſome another, to ſalve the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> according as their Imaginations led them. And hence it was, that ſome thought their Origination was not altogether unlike the ſpontaneous Production of Inſects; only theſe being Annual, required no great contribution of Heavenly Influkes; but that of the Production of Men or more perfect Animals, <hi>Non ſine magna coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stium corporum conjunctione ſive mutatione:</hi> Others again, more ſoberly attributed it meerly to the Power and Wiſdom of the glorious God: Others, to the efficiency of Angels; whereof in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>And this Contemplation of ſuch Philoſophers and knowing Men coming abroad into the World, the generality of Mankind ſubſcribed to the truth of the grand <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it ſelf; namely, That Mankind had at one time or other, or by ſome means or other an Origination differing
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64147:127"/>
from the ordinary and natural method of Propagation now obſerved: And finding that the ſame held a ſingular congruity to the nature of things, and the general Conception and Reaſon of the Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; the generality of the World entertained, and by Tradition tranſmitted this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to their Poſterity.</p>
               <p>But finding the Philoſophers and Wiſe Men ſo uncertain and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing, <hi>de modo,</hi> and unable to give any ſatisfactory Reſolution thereof; every Nation, and almoſt every Perſon took up what particular <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> pleaſed them for the Method or Manner of ſuch Origination; and herein the Wantonneſs of Poets, and the Crafts of their Heatheniſh Prieſts and Hierophants abundantly gratified the Fancies of the People with Superſtructions and Inventions of their own.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is obſervable, that all thoſe ancient Traditions of things that were truly done, and ſo delivered over and received by Mankind, as they have for the ſubſtance and main of them been preſerved by the ſtrength of this Tradition; ſo where the Holy Scriptures have not been taught or known, theſe Traditions have been admirably dreſſed by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtications and Superadditions, introduced by the Phantaſies of Poets or the deceits of Heatheniſh Prieſts, or by the gradual corruptings of the Traditions themſelves. Thus the Hiſtory of the Creation, of the Flood, of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> of <hi>Noah</hi> and his three Sons; many of which are, for the ſubſtance of them, preſerved among the Barbarous People of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>West Indies</hi> at this day, as appears by thoſe that have written the Relation, eſpecially of the <hi>Americans,</hi> as <hi>Acoſta,</hi> and <hi>De Laet</hi> have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs been covered over with divers fabulous and deviſed Additions and Stories: and ſo it happened alſo among the ancient Heatheniſh Writers, as hath been at large demonſtrated, eſpecially by <hi>Bochart</hi> in his <hi>Phaleg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as touching the Opinion of the Learned Tribe, which, as before is ſhewn, fell into two Parties: The one holding the Eternal Succeſſions of Mankind, whereof in this Second Section: The other holding a Firſt Inception of Mankind, <hi>Ex non genitis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The latter Opinion far out-ballanceth the former, both in the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, and the multitude and great Learning of thoſe that ſo aſſerted it; and ſhould, according to the propounded Method, be here declared.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I intend in the next Section to examin the various Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of thoſe of the latter ſort, touching the Manner of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Man, I ſhall reſerve that Buſineſs to the next Section; wherein I ſhall at once conſider the Learned ancient Authors that hold the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of Mankind, and ſhall alſo deliver and examin their ſeveral Suppoſitions touching the ſame.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. I.</hi> The Opinions of the more Learned part of Mankind, Philoſophers and other Writers, touching Man's Origination.</head>
               <p>I Have in the former Parts of this Enquiry ſhewed, that there have been among Philoſophers and other Heathen, and ſome modern Writers, Two great Opinions touching Man's Origination: 1. Thoſe that thought it indeed to be without any Origination, but Eternal; and this Opinion they took up principally upon two Reaſons: 1. Becauſe the <hi>Medium</hi> or Clew by which they guided themſelves, was the common, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Method of Productions by ſucceſſive Generations; and they thought it more ſutable to take their Meaſures, and make their Concluſions conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the courſe of Nature, which they ſaw and obſerved, and judged to be always uniform, and like itſelf; which could not be ſuch, if Mankind had any other Method of Origination than now it hath: And in Natural Appearances, Cauſes and Effects, they thought it not becoming the <hi>Genius</hi> or Spirit of a Philoſopher to call in any other Aſſiſtant or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducent than what was and is the ordinary Rule, Courſe, and Law of Nature as they now find it. And by this means they thought that they proceeded conſonantly both to Nature, and to themſelves. 2. Becauſe that among thoſe ancient Philoſophers that either ſuppoſed the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Mankind to be either caſual, as <hi>Epicurus, Democritus, &amp;c.</hi> or to be natural, from the Earth, and conjunction of the Influences of Heavenly Bodies in ſome Periodical Aſpects; or partly natural, and partly fortuitous, or at leaſt ſpontaneous, as Inſects ariſe: I ſay, in and among theſe various Suppoſitions of an Origination of Mankind (yea and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Animals) <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> they found ſo much incertainty, improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and repugnancy, that they threw them all aſide, together alſo with the Beginning or Origination of Mankind; and took up that more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious, and more ſutable, as they thought, to the Laws which they obſerved in Nature; and concluded, That the Generations of Mankind and of perfect Animals were without beginning, but always obtained in the ſame manner as now they are. Of this Opinion was <hi>Ocellus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caenus,</hi> and likewiſe <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> though in ſome places he ſeems to be doubtful, and although <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus</hi> ſeems to aſſert an Origination of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet in ſome other places his Expreſſions are doubtful: and therefore <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> in his golden Book <hi>de Die Natali,</hi> reckons as well <hi>Plato</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle, Ocellus Lucanus, Architas Tarentinus, Xenocrates, Dicearchus, Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Theophraſtus,</hi> to be Aſſertors of the Eternity of Mankind.</p>
               <p>And this Opinion I have examined in the Chapters of the Second Section of this Book, and offered Reaſons Phyſical, Metaphyſical and Moral againſt it. The laſt Moral Reaſon which I offered was, The
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64147:128"/>
received Opinion of Mankind aſſerting the Origination of Man, and that as well of the common ſort of People as of the Tribe of the Learned Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>The former I diſpatched in the laſt Chapter, but the Suffrage of the <hi>Gens literata</hi> I reſerved to this Section, becauſe thereby at once I may with the ſame labour ſhew the Opinions of Learned Men among the Heathen, aſſerting the Origination of Mankind, and what their ſeveral Sentiments were concerning the manner of it: And therefore I ſhall be conſtrained herein to mention the Opinions of ſome of thoſe Learned Philoſophers above-mention, and to add ſome others of the contrary Perſwaſion, which out-ballance the former.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond general Opinion, was of thoſe Learned Philoſophers that held an Origination of Mankind <hi>ex non genitis;</hi> and the Reaſon moving them to this Perſwaſion was, not only the great Tradition that obtained generally in favour of it, and the great reaſonableneſs of the Suppoſition it ſelf; but alſo the many abſurd Conſequences, and indeed irreconcilable Contradictions that they found in the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of an Eternal Succeſſion of Humane Generations without beginning: Inſomuch that the Aſſertors themſelves of Eternal Generations were doubtful of the truth of their own Perſwaſions, as will hereafter appear.</p>
               <p>And thoſe of this latter ſort were even <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf, <hi>Anaximander, Empedocles, Parmenides,</hi> and <hi>Zeno Citicus</hi> the great Founder of the Sect of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> with thoſe that followed or favoured it. But above all, the great Law-giver <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was divinely inſpired; and yet if he had not that advantage of Divine Infallibility, but ſtood barely upon the great credibility both of his Perſon, his Learning, and the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it ſelf which he delivered, he hath as great a weight, even upon a natural, moral, and rational account as any, or all the reſt put together. But becauſe I intend a particular Explication of the <hi>Hypotheſis Moſaica,</hi> I ſhall not mingle this among the other Opinions, but reſerve it for the next Section.</p>
               <p>The Heathen Philoſophers that held the Origination of Mankind <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> have theſe things in general wherein they agree one with another, and with the Truth it ſelf; and ſome things wherein they differ among themſelves, and in ſome things from the Truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They herein agree both among themſelves, and with the Truth, and with that excellent and divine Relation of <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 1. That Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is not Eternal, but had a Beginning <hi>ex non genitis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They herein alſo agree among themſelves, and with the Truth, That it is moſt abſolutely neceſſary (if Mankind had a Beginning or Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) it muſt needs be in a differing kind and manner from that common courſe whereby Mankind is now propagated. This is aſſerted by thoſe that hold the Origination of Mankind by the Efficiency of Almighty God (conſonant to the <hi>Moſaical Hypotheſis</hi>) either immediately, or partly by the Inſtrumentality of Angels, as <hi>Zeno Citicus, Plato</hi> and others: it is alſo aſſerted by them that hold the Origination of Mankind to be at firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Democritus.</hi> And therefore as to theſe Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Suppoſitions, it is not only neceſſary that they ſhould ſuppoſe a differing manner of the firſt Origination of Mankind from what now obtains; but it is conſonant alſo to their Principles, and the grounds of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64147:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Suppoſition that it muſt be ſo: This is alſo aſſerted by thoſe that ſuppoſe the Origination of Mankind to be purely natural, and according to the conſtituted Rule of Nature. But yet this Suppoſition, though moſt neceſſarily true where an Origination <hi>ex non genitis</hi> is once ſuppoſed, yet it ſeems leſs ſutable to the Principles of thoſe Men that aſſert ſuch a natural Production of Mankind as is by them aſſerted, becauſe they mancipating all Productions and Effects to the Laws of Nature, and governing their thoughts, and taking their meaſures barely by it, have no reaſon to think or believe any other Method of Production of Mankind to have at any time been any otherwiſe than as they ſee it now to be; which, as is before ſhewn, was the reaſon why <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> inclined to the Opinion of the Eternity of Humane Generations, becauſe Nature is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be conſonant to it ſelf, and always to have been what once it was.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But in the Explication of the Cauſe and Manner of this Origination of Mankind, therein they differed very much among themſelves.</p>
               <p>This difference conſiſted principally in two great Conſiderations; 1. In the true ſtating of the efficient Cauſe of this Origination of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: 2. In the Manner, Method, and Order of ſuch Origination.</p>
               <p>As to the difference touching the Cauſe of ſuch Origination, and the nature of that Cauſe thereof:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some aſſigned a bare fortuitous Cauſe of the firſt Origination of Mankind, as <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and his Explicator <hi>Lucretius;</hi> for although in ſome places they are driven to aſſert ſome determinate <hi>Semina,</hi> of Mankind and perfect Animals, to avoid that indefinite and unlimited excurſion of Atoms; yet they that ſuppoſe theſe <hi>Semina,</hi> do ſuppoſe a fortuitous Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of Atoms to the Conſtitution of theſe <hi>Semina,</hi> and ſo upon the whole account it is fortuitous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some aſſign a natural determined Cauſe of the firſt production of Mankind, namely, the due preparation of the fat and ſlimy Earth after a long incubation of Waters, and ſome admirable Conjunction of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Heavenly and Planetary Bodies, in ſome certain Period of Time at a long diſtance from us; which as naturally and neceſſarily produced the firſt Couples of Mankind, and likewiſe of other perfect Animals, as neceſſarily and naturally as the return of the Vernal Sun produceth divers ſorts of Inſects, which though they are called <hi>ſponte orientia,</hi> yet they ariſe meerly from a Connexion of Natural Cauſes, and the various Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Diſpoſitions of the Elementary, and Poſitions and Influxions of the Heavenly Bodies: Thus ſome of the Ancients, and alſo <hi>Avicen, Cardanus, Caeſalpinus, Berogardus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Some of the Ancients, that moſt truly aſſign the Origination of Mankind to the moſt High, Intelligent, Powerful, Beneficent Being, <hi>viz.</hi> Almighty God, and the <hi>Beneplacitum</hi> and <hi>Fiat</hi> of his Omnipotent Will; as <hi>Zeno Citicus.</hi> And thus their differences aroſe touching the Cauſe of this Origination.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The Opinion of <hi>Anaximander: Videri ſibi ex aqua terráque calefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctos, exortos eſſe ſive piſces, ſive piſcibus ſimillima animalia, in his homines

               </p>
               <p>As to the Origination of brute Animals, he ſeems to aſcribe the ſame in effect as happens in the equivocal production of Inſects.</p>
               <p>But as to the Origination of Man, he ſeems to agree with the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> but gives thereof a fuller Explication; namely, 1. That it was a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Production, and not ſo fortuitous as that of Animals. 2. That theſe <hi>Semina humanae naturae</hi> were either the immediate Productions of the great <hi>Opifex rerum,</hi> or at leaſt were left in the Earth by the Celeſtial Nature, while it ſtood mingled therewith <hi>in maſſa Chaotica:</hi> By which means, it ſeems, he thought not that the production of Mankind was
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64147:129"/>
by a gradual proceſs and maturation in the Earth, and from it, like the ordinary courſe of the Formative proceſs <hi>in utero matris,</hi> in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Generation; but by a ſhorter and more compendious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: For, according to the ancient Mythology, <hi>Japetus</hi> ſignified the Heaven, and <hi>Japeti ſatus,</hi> or <hi>Prometheus</hi> the Son of the Heaven, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence which Almighty God exerciſed by the inſtrumentality of the Heavenly Motions: And the Ancients attributed the Formation or Configuration of the humane Body in its firſt original to this Divine Providence, whereby thoſe Seminal Particles before deſcribed being taken and included in convenient Elementary Matter, the whole Compoſition was by the Divine Providence moulded up into the humane Shape and Conſiſtency in its firſt Origination. This was that Notion that divers of the Ancients, and <hi>Ovid</hi> out of them had concerning the firſt Origination of Mankind; <hi>vide Caelium Rhodogin. l.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 19, <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. and ſeems to have ſome analogy with that <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>Thus we have an account of the Opinions, 1. Of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philoſophers: 2. Of the old <hi>Academicks:</hi> 3. Of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> all ſeeming to agree in the Suppoſition of the Eternity of the World: 4. Of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> under which I include that of <hi>Anaximander</hi> and <hi>Empedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> differing only in the <hi>modus:</hi> 5. Of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> which give a true Account both of the Origination of Mankind, and of the Manner of it: where I have been the longer, becauſe it is a Key to all that follows, and gives us a Scheme of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeveral Opinions, and the Authors and Aſſertors thereof, I ſhall here farther illuſtrate and examin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the Opinion of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> becauſe we have nothing extant of his writing, I can ſay little more touching his Opinion; though ſome ſuppoſe, he was not of Opinion that the World or Mankind was Eternal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Touching <hi>Plato,</hi> it is true, he ſeems very various and Poetical in his writing; and by reaſon of the Method of his Diſcourſes, by way of Dialogues, it is hard to determin what his Opinion was concerning the Eternity of the World, or of the Generations of Mankind.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of his third Book <hi>de Legibus,</hi> but eſpecially in the middle of his ſixth, under the Perſons of <hi>Athenienſis hoſpes,</hi> and <hi>Clinias,</hi> he intimates his Opinion of the Eternity of the World and Mankind: Athen. <hi>Scire omnes oportet, hominum generationem vel nullum prorſus unquam initium habuiſſe, neque terminum habiturum, ſed fuiſſe omninò ſemper &amp; fore; aut ſi coepit, inaeſtimabili ante nos temporis magnitudine incepiſſe.</hi> Clin. <hi>Plané.</hi> And again, in his <hi>Menexemus,</hi> under the Perſon of <hi>Socrates</hi> commending the Country of <hi>Attica; Altera ejus laus erit, quod eo tempore quo tellus omnia animalia omnigena producebat, feras &amp; armenta omnia; tellus duntaxat noſtra ad hoc ſterilis erat, agreſtibúſque animalibus vacua, propriè verò ex omnibus animalibus hominem genuit, qui caeteris intelligentia praestat, ſolúſque jus ac deos colit.</hi> And again, in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> in the Perſon of <hi>Timaeus</hi> he gives us an Account of the Original of Mankind, and the manner of it, to this effect; That when Almighty God had made and ſet in order the great World, and endowed it with a living Soul, and thereby it became a great Animal; and had alſo made a ſort of inferior Deities <hi>(dii ex Deo)</hi> and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64147:130"/>
endowed them alſo with Immortality, he brings in the great God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking theſe inferior Deities; <hi>Accedite vos ſecundùm naturam ad anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium generationem, ita ut vim imitemini meam, qua in ortu veſtro ſum uſus. Atque ejus quidem animalis quod in ipſis tale futurum eſt ut cum immortalibus appellatione conveniat, divinúmque vocetur, principatúmque teneat, &amp; juſtitiam ſimul ac vos ultro colat: Ego vobis ſemen &amp; initium tradam, vos caetera exequi par eſt, ut immortali naturae mortalem attexentes, faciatis generetíſque ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malia, ſubminiſtrantéſque alimenta augeatis, &amp; conſumpta rurſum recipiatis. Haec fatus, in eodem cratere in quo mundi totius animam permiſcens temperavit, ſuperioris temperationis reliquias miſcendo perfudit, &amp;c. Satis autem &amp; quaſi ſparſis animis, per ſingula ſingulis convenientia temporum inſtrumenta, fore ut animal naſceretur, quod omnium animalium maximè eſſet divino cultui de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he now gives us an account of the Creation of Man, namely, of his Soul by the great God. Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> ſeems not to be reckoned among the firm Aſſertors of the Eternity of Mankind, nor of the World; and accordingly his follower <hi>Proclus</hi> herein agrees with his Maſter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Touching <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> that were his followers, as <hi>Simplicius, Averroes,</hi> and others (except <hi>Philoponus</hi>) their Opinion ſeems to be for the Eternity not only of the World, but of Mankind, and of the perfect Animals: ſo that in <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>de Generatione Animalium, cap.</hi> 1. he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins, <hi>Quod non fuit primus leo, &amp;c.</hi> and in his way of reaſoning follows <hi>Ocellus Lucanus,</hi> who was a more ancient Philoſopher, and tenaciouſly aſſerted the Eternity of the World.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf ſeems not to be over-confident of this Opinion, but holds it as a Problem, and in ſome places ſeems to give Intimations to the contrary. 2. <hi>Politic, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Putandum est primos homines ſive ex terra geniti fuerunt, ſive ex corruptione aliqua ſervati, ignaros fuiſſe, &amp;c.</hi> and in his 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>de Generatione,</hi> upon the various Productions of the Earth and Water, <hi>Ut animae quodammodo plena ſunt omnia:</hi> and in his 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Problem, ſect.</hi> 15. <hi>Qui de natura diſſerunt, animantia in principio orta eſſe dicunt ingenti aliqua mundi universíque mutatione:</hi> and in his 64<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Problem</hi> of his 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Section, Quam ob cauſam animantium alia non ſolum coitu ſed etiam ſponte naturae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creantur, alia ex coitu duntaxat proveniunt, ut Homo &amp; Equus, etſi non ob aliam cauſam, tamen quod aliis gignendi tempus breve ſtatutum eſt. Itaque fieri non poteſt ut tempus quod vim obtinet generandi amplificetur prorogetúrque, ſed temporum viciſſítudine prorogationéque, ut prorogetur contingit; aliis multò generatio ampliari ſolet: etenim vel anno vel decem menſium ſpatio confici aſſolet, quo pacto vel nullo pacto, vel ex coitu procreari illa neceſſe est.</hi> So that he attributes the reaſon of the new production of Men and great Animals only to the time that they are to be perfected <hi>in utero.</hi> And <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Topicor. cap.</hi> 11. he ſtates the Queſtion, <hi>Whether the World had a Beginning, or not?</hi> to be a Problem; wherein probabilities are on either ſide.</p>
               <p>By theſe paſſages of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, he ſeems not to be ſo poſitive in his Opinion touching the Eternity of Mankind at leaſt; but rather inclines to that for the Eternity of Generations, upon theſe Reaſons: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not willing to ſuppoſe any other ſtate of things in the World than what he found; and ſince he never found any production of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or the perfect Animals, <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> he therefore concluded them to have been ever produced in that method that he found them in the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64147:130"/>
ordinary and ſetled courſe of Nature. 2. Becauſe, as he was not ſatisfied with the ſtrange and improbable <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of <hi>Empedocles, Anaximander,</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> touching the Production of Mankind; ſo he could not excogitate any of his own which had any clearneſs or certainty to him, being utterly unacquainted (for ought we know) with the <hi>Moſaical Hypotheſis.</hi> 3. Becauſe he being a great admirer of Nature, and the ordinary proceeding thereof, he was not willing to entertain any ſuch Suppoſition as was not evident, according to the ordinary method of Nature, which he ſo much venerated; eſpecially ſuch as might ſeem diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to his great <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Eternity of the general Frame of the reſt of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Generatione Animalium, cap.</hi> 11. upon a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a firſt Production of Men or Animals, he conforms his <hi>Theſis</hi> concerning them to his general Doctrine: <hi>Quamobrem de prima hominum atque quadrupedum generatione (ſi quando primum terrigenae oriebantur, ut aliqui dicunt) non temere exiſtimaveris altero, de duobus his, modo oriri; aut enim ex verme constituto primum, aut ex ovo: quippe cum aut intra ſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beant cibum ad incrementum neceſſe ſit, qui quidem conceptus vermis eſt; aut aliunde accipere, ìdque aut ex parente, aut ex parte conceptus. Itaque ſi alterum fieri non poteſt ut effluat ex terra, quomodo caeteris animalibus ex parente, relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur neceſſario, ut ex parte conceptus accipiatur. Talem autem generatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem eſſe ex ovo aut verme fatemur. Ergo ſi initium ullum generationis omnium animalium fuit, alterutrum de his fuiſſe probabile eſſe apertum eſt. Sed minus rationis eſt, ut ex ovo prodierint; nullius enim generationem animalem talem videmus; ſed alterum tum ſanguineorum quae diximus, tum exanguium, qualia ſunt inſectorum nonnulla, &amp; ea quae teſta operiuntur, de quibus agitur. Non enim ex parte aliqua oriuntur, ut ea quae ovo naſcuntur.</hi> Thus he conforms his Poſition to his general Doctrine, upon a Suppoſition of the ſpontaneous Origination of Animals.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I come to the general Doctrine of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> under which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that of <hi>Anaximander</hi> and <hi>Empedocles,</hi> who though they differ ſomething in the manner of their <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> yet they agree in the main for a kind of ſpontaneous production out of the Earth. 1. <hi>Empedocles</hi> ſeems to think that the Limbs or Members of Men grew here and there ſcattered and diſtinct, and that they were after concrete together by Heat and Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, into the ſtature, as it ſeems, of a full grown Man. 2. <hi>Anaximander</hi> thinks that they grew into the full ſtature of Men and Women in the <hi>involucrum</hi> of ſomething like Fiſhes, and then brake out into the World, as it ſeems, in their perfect ſtature. And that near unto this was the Opinion of <hi>Anaximander,</hi> appears by <hi>Plutarch, in Placitis Philoſophorum, l.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>Prima animalia in humore nata corticibus contenta ſpinoſis, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiora autem facta ad ſiccitatem deſciviſſe, ruptóque cortice non multum temporis ſupervixiſſe.</hi> Only in the recital of his Opinion by <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> they both ſeem to agree in this, that they were of full growth when they thus broke their Priſons. 3. <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſeem to think that they were hatched in theſe <hi>Folliculi</hi> or Terreſtrial Excreſcences, and then nouriſhed by a Juyce of the Earth, until they were able to ſhift for themſelves. <hi>Lucretius</hi> hath given us the Doctrine of <hi>Epicurus</hi> in Verſe, in his fifth Book, <hi>Pag.</hi> 665. which is rendred in Proſe by <hi>Gaſſendus, in Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagmate Philoſoph.

Cum verò in humidis calore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibito generatio fiat, &amp; noctu quidem circumfuſus aer humorem praeſtet, qui die Solis virtute conſolidetur: tandem putredines illae ad ſummum perductae, adveniente veluti partus tempore, exutis confractiſque pelliculis, omne genus educunt animantium: quorum ea quae majorem ſortita calorem ſunt, in ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem regionem volatilia effecta abierunt; quae verò plus terrae continebant, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentia, aliáque terreſtria evaſerunt animantia.

               <p>In theſe precedent Opinions of <hi>Anaximander, Empedocles, Epicurus,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> there is ſomething that agrees with that Truth that I have aſſerted, namely, The Origination of Mankind <hi>ex non genitis.</hi> And for this purpoſe theſe Inſtances are eſpecially given by me. But there is ſomething that I ſhall in what follows impugn, namely, The Method or Manner of ſuch Productions, which according to theſe Mens Opinions is either purely Caſual, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his followers held; or at leaſt Natural and Neceſſary, as <hi>Anaximander, Empedocles,</hi> and ſome of the looſe paſſages of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeem to import, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſome great Conjunction
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:64147:132"/>
of the Heavenly Bodies, and ſome great Natural Mutation in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary World.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I now come to the farther Examination of the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who alſo agree in this main Truth, That Mankind had an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <hi>ex non genitis:</hi> and the Founder of that Sect hath given a rational and true Method thereof, namely, That this Origination was by the Power and Will of Almighty God: But when thoſe of this Sect came to give a more particular Explication of the Manner of this Production, they ſeem to differ.</p>
               <p>

               <p>In his firſt Book <hi>de Legibus</hi> he hath this paſſage touching the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Man: <hi>Nam cum de natura omni quaeritur, diſputari ſolent nimirum iſta: perpetuis curſibus, converſionibus coeleſtibus extitiſſe quandam materiam ſerendi generis humani, quod ſparſum in terras, atque ſatum, divino auctum ſit animorum munere. Nam quod aliquibus cohaerent homines, è mortali genere ſumſerunt, quae fragilia eſſent, &amp; caduca: animum eſſe ingeneratum, à Deo: ex quo verè vel agnatio nobis cum coeleſtibus, vel genus vel ſtirps appellari poteſt. Itaque ex tot generibus nullum est animal, prater hominem, quod habeat notitiam aliquam Dei; de ipsísque hominibus nullagens est neque tam immanſueta, neque tam fera, quae non, etiam ſi ignoret, qualem habere Deum deceat, tamen habendum ſciat. Ex quo efficitur illud ut is agnoſcat Deum, qui unde ortus ſit, quaſi recordetur ac noſcat.</hi> By this he ſuppoſeth that there might be as it were a Proſemination of the Humane Fabrick by the Converſion of the Heavens, and then the ſame were ſtored with Souls immediately produced by Almighty God.</p>

               <p n="1">1. A Tradition which ſeems generally to have been derived unto Mankind from the firſt Parents thereof, and ſo generally believed and entertained.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A great congruity of Reaſon that attended this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and an extrication thereby of the Minds of conſidering Men from infinite diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which the Suppoſition of Eternal Generations doth neceſſarily produce.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. II.</hi> Touching the various Methods of the Origination of Mankind.</head>
               <p>HItherto I have endeavoured to ſhew thoſe Evidences both of Reaſon and of Fact, which ſeem to aſſert the Origination of Mankind; and I have concluded with that laſt in the two precedent Chapters, namely, The Opinion and Perſwaſion of the Unlearned and Learned part of Mankind that have ſuppoſed ſuch an Origination of Mankind, the weight or authority of which reſts in the conſideration of thoſe Means whereby this Opinion or Perſwaſion hath been ingenerated in Mankind: For the Opinions or Perſwaſions of Men, concerning eſpecially a Matter of Fact, have their weight or authority in argumentation from that Principle or Motive of ſuch a Perſwaſion: and this I have reduced to one or both of theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some Tradition that hath been derived, and derived in probability from the firſt Parents of Mankind, that beſt knew their own Inception, which hath ſince accordingly prevailed almoſt in all Places and Ages.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The congruity of ſuch a Suppoſition to Reaſon, and the Solution of thoſe Difficulties which muſt needs ariſe from an Eternal Succeſſion of Mankind. And this Motive of this Perſwaſion, though it began with the more thinking and conſidering ſort of Mankind, yet from them hath been inſinuated and derived unto the reſt of Mankind, and by them entertained, as conſonant to the common Reaſon of Humane Nature.</p>
               <p>I have laid the weight of my reaſoning touching the Origination of Mankind upon the Reaſons firſt given in the beginning of this Tract; and I have only ſubjoyned thoſe Reaſons of Fact that might probably bear teſtimony to the truth of the Suppoſition, and I have endeavoured
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64147:133"/>
to ſhew where the ſtrength, and where the deficiencies of thoſe Evidences of Fact do reſt; and which are moſt concludent, and which not.</p>
               <p>I have concluded all theſe Evidences of Fact, with this concerning the common or general conſent of the greateſt and learnedſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind therein; and I have concluded with this Evidence of Fact, not as if this were entertained by all: for 1. It is not without Oppoſers, as <hi>Ariſtotle, Ocellus Lucanus,</hi> and the <hi>Pythagoreans:</hi> and 2. Common Opinion or Perſwaſion of Mankind, eſpecially touching Matter of Fact, is very fallible and unſtable: 3. In this very Matter in queſtion, there are by common perſwaſion of many of theſe Men, ſuperadded certain fabulous, incredible and untrue Surmiſes touching the Manner and the Methods of this Origination, appearing in ſome of the Opinions delivered in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>But the reaſon why I conclude with that Inſtance touching the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Men, is, becauſe it lets me into that which is the Second prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Part of this Diſcourſe, namely, The various <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of thoſe that ſuppoſed, admitted, or believed this Origination, which are in effect all contained in the former Chapter, which I intend in the following Diſcourſe to examin.</p>
               <p>Therefore, having thus partly out of the common Perſwaſion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but principally by the other foregoing Reaſons made my Concluſion, That Mankind had a Beginning, now, as I think, delivered what may be ſaid for the proof of this Propoſition, That Mankind had their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> and in ſome good meaſure eſtabliſhed that Suppoſition; I now proceed to examin the truth or probability of thoſe ſeveral Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which are before delivered, touching the Means, Method or Manner of this Origination.</p>
               <p>And not to examin every particular Adjunct or Explication of theſe ſeveral Methods, I ſhall divide theſe general Suppoſitions of the Ancients touching the Origination of Mankind into theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Opinion, That the production of Mankind was <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> was fortuitous or caſual; ſuch was the Opinion of <hi>Democritus, Epicurus,</hi> and ſome others: the manner of the Explication thereof I ſhall hereafter conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Opinion, That the production of Mankind was <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> was natural, and was founded upon a natural concourſe of Cauſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the diſpoſition of the Earth and Water, and the Influx of the Heaven. This was the Opinion of ſome of the Antients, but much improved by ſome later Philoſophers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Opinion, That the production of Mankind <hi>ex non genitis</hi> was by the immediate Power, Wiſdom, and Providence of Almighty God, and his meer <hi>Beneplacitum.</hi> This was the Opinion of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and differs but very little from the Divine Truth touching Man's Creation, as it is delivered by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that which is ſaid either for or againſt theſe Methods of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Mankind, will be alſo applicable to the production of the perfect Animals that have their ordinary production <hi>ex conjunctione maris &amp; faeminae,</hi> and not otherwiſe; though what is ſaid concerning thoſe Animals will be more evident touching Man, which is a far more perfect nature than other Animals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:64147:133"/>Firſt therefore I begin with the Opinion of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> which was in ſubſtance this; That there were eternally an infinite number of ſmall imperceptible Bodies, that floated up and down in a vaſt infinite <hi>Inane;</hi> and theſe were the <hi>Principia</hi> of all other Beings beneath Almighty God: theſe they call Atoms. That thoſe Atoms were eternally and caſually moved in this infinite <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and by their mutual percuſſions the great Syſtems of the Heavenly and Elementary Bodies were framed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted: That beſides that concourſe of Atoms that conſtituted the greater Integrals of the World, there was a certain coalition of Atoms that conſtituted certain <hi>Semina</hi> or Seminal Bodies, for the ſtoring and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the greater Integrals of the Univerſe, eſpecially the Earth and Seas: That though the coalition of thoſe <hi>Semina</hi> were caſual, and by an accidental or fortuitous aggregation of ſome Atoms; yet theſe were the immediate, primitive, productive Principles of Men, Animals, Birds and Fiſhes, and that determined them in their ſeveral <hi>Species:</hi> That thoſe Primordial Seeds thus fortuitouſly coagulated out of the <hi>Prima principia,</hi> or Atoms, were ſcattered by their Motion into the Earth and Seas: That by reaſon of the ſtrength of the newly coagulated Bodies of the Earth and Water, and the heat of the Sun, theſe <hi>Semina</hi> did bring forth Man, and Brutes, and Birds, and Fiſhes; but that by the decay of the ſtrength of the Earth and Waters, that Method of production of Men and perfect Animals is ceaſed, and their production now delegated ordinarily to Propagation: though in ſome places, and at ſome times, eſpecially between the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> ſuch a Pullulation of Men and Beaſts may be ſuppoſed to be: That yet to this day the ſpontaneous production of ſome ſort of Vegetables and Inſects continues ſtill in force, the Earth and Waters being furniſhed with a ſufficient ſtore of ſuch <hi>Semina</hi> either of old or daily production; and with a ſufficient ſtrength, by the help of the Solar or Ethereal Heat, to perfect their productions: That the firſt ſpontaneous production of Men and the perfect Animals was in certain <hi>Folliculi</hi> or Bladders, excreſcent from the Earth; and the growth of theſe Men and Animals gradual, being firſt <hi>Embryones,</hi> then grown ripe for Birth, then breaking out of thoſe <hi>Folliculi,</hi> and furniſhed with nouriſhment from the Earth, <hi>inſtar lactis,</hi> till they were able to ſhift for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Touching this Suppoſition, although it contain in it that Truth that I have hitherto contended for, namely, That Mankind had an Original <hi>ex non genitis;</hi> or, That the Generations of Mankind in that order which now it holds, was not Eternal: yet the Manner or Method of this <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean</hi> Origination of the World, and particularly of the perfect Animals, but eſpecially of Mankind, is meerly fictitious, untrue, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Principia</hi> or Atoms of infinite number floating in <hi>Vacuo infinito,</hi> is a thing meerly invented, and hath neither truth, nor evidence, nor probability in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Motion of theſe Atoms in this great <hi>Vacuum,</hi> unleſs firſt excited or put into Motion by ſome intelligent active Principle, is fabulous and incredible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Coalition of theſe Atoms by fortuitous ſtrokes or motions, and their Coalition into that admirable Order and Conſtitution which
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64147:134"/>
we ſee in the Univerſe, or greater Integrals of this <hi>Mundus aſpectabilis,</hi> is utterly incredible, and indeed impoſſible. But theſe things being beſide my preſent purpoſe, and deſerving a large proſecution, I ſhall diſmiſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Touching theſe <hi>Semina,</hi> and the Coagulation of them by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous coalition of Atoms, they were driven to this Suppoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they found themſelves at a loſs, if they ſhould have ſuppoſed, that <hi>per ſaltum</hi> their Atoms had been the immediate Conſtituents of Men and Animals; they could never have ſalved that ſpecification of things in their ſeveral kinds, and the continuation of them in that conſtancy and order which is evidently found in the natures of Men and Animals; but either there would be an utter incertainty in the firſt Conſtitution of them, <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet;</hi> or at leaſt it were impoſſible that they ſhould continue their Propagation of their kind, but the conſtituent Atoms that ſhould make up a Man, might have fallen into the Conſtitution of a Horſe, or a Lion. <hi>Lucret. ubi ſupra.</hi>

                  <l>Seminibus certis certa genitrice creata.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And again, it were never explicable by the various concourſe of Atoms, that there could be ſuch an orderly, conſtant, and admirable accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the parts of the Body to their uſe, or one to another. It is truly ſaid by <hi>Galen</hi> in his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book <hi>De Hipp. &amp; Platonis decretis, l.</hi> 9. <hi>Quippe cum artem raro fine ſuo fruſtrari, fortunam raro eundem aſſequi, nemo ſit qui neſciat; quocirca temerariam &amp; fortuitam, neque artificialem cauſam fabricae noſtri corporis exiſtimare, abſurdum.</hi> And again, in that divine Book <hi>De Uſu Partium,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Lib.</hi> 11. that excellent Philoſopher ſhews the groſs abſurdity and impoſſibility that any happy concourſe of Atoms can ever fit and ſettle that congruity in the Parts of the Humane Body that is there. There needs no other Confutation of the vanity of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, than that excellent Expoſtulation in that Book, fit for the matter, but too long for the tenth of it to be here tranſcribed.</p>
               <p>And therefore to avoid that inſuperable abſurdity, they have ſubſtituted a <hi>Medium</hi> between the Atomical Principles and the conſtitution of the ſpontaneous Birth of Men; namely, theſe <hi>Semina,</hi> made up to be the immediate Principle of theſe ſpontaneous Productions of Mankind, as alſo of perfect Animals in their firſt production.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Semina</hi> there were in the firſt Conſtitution of Mankind, I ſhall have occaſion at large to examin in the next Chapter: But at preſent it ſhall ſuffice to ſay and prove, That there is as great an abſurdity and impoſſibility to ſuppoſe a caſual production of ſuch <hi>Semina,</hi> as there is to
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64147:134"/>
ſuppoſe an immediate caſual production of any Man or Animal <hi>omnibus numeris perfectum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this <hi>Seminium humanae naturae</hi> muſt have in it the Vital Nature, the power of attracting to it ſelf that ſubſtance which muſt ſerve to make up the Individual: It muſt have the power and energy of that formative act, whereby the Matter is conformed to its ſpecifical Nature; it muſt have potentially at leaſt the whole Syſteme of Humane Nature, or at leaſt that Ideal Principle or Configuration thereof, in the evolution whereof the complement and formation of the Humane Nature muſt conſiſt; and beſides this, it muſt have in it at leaſt potentially all the Faculties of the Humane Soul, not only the <hi>vim altricem,</hi> but the <hi>vim ſenſitivam &amp; intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectualem,</hi> and all this drawn from a fortuitous coalition of ſenſeleſs and dead Atoms. Whereby theſe two grand Abſurdities would enſue:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a ſort of dead, ſenſeleſs, unintelligent Particles of Matter, ſhould by their Coalition be advanced into a Being, that at leaſt potentially hath all the Faculties of Life, Senſe, or Intellect, and ſo ariſe to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection beyond the Sphere and Circle of their own Nature or Power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That though it might be poſſible, that by skill and the wiſe conduct of an Intelligent Being, theſe Atoms might be ſo marſhalled or qualified, that they might advance to be a fit <hi>Seminium</hi> of a reaſonable Creature, yet it is not poſſible to ſuppoſe, that meer Chance or Fortune ſhould make up theſe Seminal Rudiments of the Humane Nature, becauſe the Actions of this Seminal Principle muſt be ſo noble and high, and yet ſo various and complicated, ſo curious and choice, that it is never poſſible for Chance to make it up, and yet if the leaſt <hi>ſtamen</hi> of this Compoſition be out of order, the whole office and uſe thereof is diſappointed: And therefore the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> makes the <hi>proceſſus formativus foetus</hi> to be no leſs admirable than the goodly ſtructure of the Humane Body, and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be the work of Chance as the other: And therefore in his Book <hi>de formatione foetus</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Ego vero, ſicut fabricam noſtri Corporis oſtendi ſummam Opificis &amp; ſapientiam &amp; potentiam prae ſe ferre; ita demonſtrari à Philoſophis velim, utrum is Opifex Deus aliquis ſit, &amp; ſapiens &amp; potens, qui &amp; prius intellexit quale uniuſcujuſque animalis corpus eſſet fabricandum, &amp; deinde quod propoſuerat potentia fuerit aſſecutus; an Anima aliqua à Deo diverſa. Neque enim naturae quae appellatur ſubſtantia, ſive corporea ſive incorporea ea ſit, ad ſummum ſapientiae dicent perveniſſe, quam ne ulla ſapientia eſſe praeditam inquiunt, unde eam tam artificioſe in foetuum formatione ſe geſſiſſe credendum non eſt: Hoc enim ab Epicuro aliiſque qui ſine providentia omnia fieri opinantur audientes, nullam fidem adhibemus.</hi> And in the Concluſion of that Book he as well blames the <hi>Platonicks, Dicentes Animam mundi foetus formare: nunquam tamen adduci potui ut crederem Scorpiones, Phalangia, Muſcas, Culices, Viperas, Vermes, Lumbricos, Pytalas ab eadem fingi &amp; formari, prope ad impietatem accedere hanc opinionem ratus.</hi> So far was he from thinking it poſſible for the Nobler Natures of Mankind, or perfect Animals, to be the work of the <hi>Anima mundi</hi> (much leſs of Fortune) that he could not ſuppoſe it a ſufficient Cauſe of the Generation of Inſects.</p>
               <p>And beſides all this, although a Man that hath received the Principle of Believing, that Almighty God might indeed <hi>ad beneplacitum</hi> mould up certain <hi>ſemina humanae naturae,</hi> and endue them with that admirable
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64147:135"/>
Formative Power: Yet ſurely for a Man that (as <hi>Epicurus</hi> did) pretends to be guided by the Conduct of Nature only, to ſuppoſe a thing ſo ſtrange to the nature of things, as they now appear, that there ſhould be another kind of <hi>ſemen humanum</hi> or <hi>animale</hi> than what is moulded in the Bodies of Men or Animals, and elicited from them by a coincidence only of ſtupid, dead, and ſenſeleſs Atoms, ſeems below the <hi>Genius</hi> of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher. <hi>Oportet enim Phyſicum ſimiliter ſe habere in omnibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And as his Suppoſition of theſe <hi>Semina,</hi> thus caſually produc'd, ſeems unconſonant both to the Reaſon and Courſe of Nature, ſo his Suppoſition of the Manner of the Generation, and Production, and Nouriſhment of this <hi>Foetus,</hi> ſeems a Fiction utterly inconſonant to the whole Method of Nature, in relation to Mankind: For what Perſon, or what Age or Country, ever ſaw any ſuch kind of Production as this? any ſuch <hi>folliculi humani foetus?</hi> Or that ever credibly heard of any Man conceived <hi>niſi in utero muliebri?</hi> abating ſome of thoſe Fables that <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Licetus</hi> delivers in his Firſt Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 28. or ſuch as have been begotten by an abominable conjunction.</p>
               <p>Again, how is it poſſible, that an Infant, whoſe Nature cannot be kept alive one moment <hi>ſine calore uterino,</hi> ſhould be preſerved in Bladders adhering to the cold Earth? Or that that Infant, who by the very courſe of Nature cannot be ſupported without the care and overſight of others for divers Months, nay ſome Years after his Birth, ſhould be able <hi>ſub dio &amp; Jove frigido</hi> to preſerve it ſelf? Again, who ever ſaw, or credibly heard of thoſe <hi>venae lacteae</hi> ariſing in the Earth, and yielding a ſutable nutriment to a new born <hi>Foetus?</hi> Theſe Suppoſitions muſt withall ſuppoſe a total Inverſion of the Courſe and Nature of Things quite from what they now are, and in all Ages have been; which, though it is true, thoſe that admit a higher Principle than Nature, do and may with ſufficient warrant and conſonancy to their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> admit, yet is utterly unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for ſuch a Philoſopher, who not only with ſome of the ancient <hi>Peripateticks</hi> excludes any Divine Providence below the Moon, but wholly exterminates it, <hi>ultra flammantis moenia Coeli.</hi>

               <p>And this is all I ſay at preſent, touching that Opinion which ſuppoſeth a meer caſual Production of Mankind.

                  <hi>CAP. III.</hi> Touching the Second Opinion of thoſe that aſſert the Natural Production of Mankind <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> or the poſsibility thereof.</head>
               <p>THe ſecond Opinion is, that by a certain kind of natural Connexion of Cauſes, Mankind not only may be, but in their firſt Origination were produced <hi>ex non genitis:</hi> Which though for diſtinctions ſake from the ordinary courſe of Generation we may call ſpontaneous or accidental, yet the ſame, if it were true, were truly natural, and deduced by a
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64147:135"/>
certain Chain of Natural Cauſes; as the yearly production of Inſects, <hi>ex putri materia,</hi> or, as the Mice or Rats in <hi>Egypt</hi> are ſuppoſed by <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> to be produced after the decreaſe of <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſeems to be the Opinion of ſome of the Ancients, that yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed not to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Epicurus</hi> touching the caſual production of things by the uncertain concourſe of Atoms, as of <hi>Anaximander</hi> and ſome others, which I ſhall not need here again to repeat; and the ſame Opinion hath been aſſerted by others, but with theſe two Correctives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the ſame is no caſual and fortuitous Production, by the meer caſual conjunction of Atomical Bodies, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> would have the firſt <hi>Semina,</hi> at leaſt of Men and Animals, to be made up; but by an ordinary, natural, and neceſſary connexion of Natural Cauſes and Effects.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That yet many of them blame the Ancients, as being too venturous in telling us the particular Method or Order of theſe Productions out of <hi>Folliculi,</hi> or <hi>Cortices ſpinoſi,</hi> or Fiſhes, becauſe that is not a thing diſcoverable by Experience, or Natural Light; yet herein they agree, That this Production may be, and hath been a Natural Production <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> though the particular Manner of it is not ſo eaſie to be certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the great Phyſician ſeems to have inclined to this Perſwaſion; for, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>de Carnibus,</hi> he writes to this purpoſe; <hi>Quod Calidum vocamus, id mihi immortale eſſe videtur; cunctáque intelligere, videre, &amp; audire, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiréque omnia tum praeſentia tum futura, cujus pars maxima cum omnia pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata eſſent in ſupremum ambitum ſeceſſit, quod mihi veteres videntur Aethera appellaſſe: altera pars locum infimum ſortita Terra quidem appellatur, frigida &amp; ſicca, multáſque motiones habens in qua multum ſanè calidi inest: tertia verò pars medium aeris locum nacta est, calidum quid exiſtens: quarta pars, terrae proximum locum obtinens, humidiſſima &amp; craſſiſſima. His igitur in orbem agitatis, cum turbata eſſet calidi pars magna, alias in terra relicta eſt, partim quidem magna, partim verò minor; &amp; alias etiam valde parva, ſed in multas partes diviſa, &amp; temporis ſucceſſu reſiccata terra iſta, in ea tanquam in mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branis contenta circum ſe putredines excitans, &amp; longo tempore incaleſcens, quod quidem ex terrae putredine pinguedinem ſortitum eſt; &amp; minimum humidi habens, id citiſſimè oſſa produxit:</hi> And then aſſigns the Methods of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Nerves, Veins, Arteries, and the reſt of the Body in conformity to this Suppoſition. So this great Phyſician and Naturaliſt delivers his Opinion. Wherein we may obſerve, that he takes the Hot or Fiery Nature to be God, knowing and underſtanding all things; which ſeems to be the ancient Error of the Eaſtern Countries, eſpecially the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this is obſervable, 1. That he ſuppoſeth an Origination of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind after the Formation of the World. 2. Though the Formative Proceſs of Mankind ſeems in his Opinion to be in a ſort Natural, yet he ſuppoſeth it not purely ſo, but a Production by thoſe fiery Particles which were Particles of a Divine Intelligent Nature. And though he be miſtaken in the Method of the Origination of Mankind, as ſhall be ſhewn, yet he ſuppoſeth it, <hi>Opus intelligentis Naturae agentis per ſcientiam.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cardanus,</hi> in his ninth Book, <hi>de Animalibus quae ex Putredine generantur,</hi> diſcourſing about Locuſts, hath this paſſage; <hi>Et non ſolum ea minuta, ſed &amp; majora animalia è putredine, imo omnia credendum est originem ducere; cum jam de Muribus conſtet, &amp; Piſces in aquis recentibus ſponte generentur:</hi> but his ſevere Corrector, <hi>Julius Scaliger,</hi> in <hi>Exercit.</hi> 193. calls it, <hi>Illa impia &amp; nefaria vox; Si Bos aliquando ex putri ortus eſt, cur poſt hominum memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam ex ejuſmodi procreatione nullus exſtitit? Caeſalpinus,</hi> in his fifth Book <hi>Quaeſtionum Peripateticarum, cap.</hi> 1. undertakes an entire Defence of the Poſition of <hi>Cardanus,</hi> and contends not only that it is poſſible, but that <hi>de facto</hi> it is true. The ſum of his Opinion ſeems to be this,</p>
               <p>That although the Soul of Man be of a higher nature and extraction, yet the Body, and theſe Powers or Faculties of Life and Senſe may be, and have been formed <hi>ex putredine,</hi> without the conjunction of Sexes; as Weeds, Vegetables, and Inſects.</p>
               <p>And that he meaneth ſuch a Production to be by an ordinary courſe of Nature, he largely inſiſts upon that Axiom of <hi>Ariſtotle, Sol &amp; homo generant hominem;</hi> which he underſtands <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> and that there is in the heat of the Sun an active, generative Principle, which in Matter prepared for its operation, commonly called Putrefaction, produceth a Seminal Formative Seed, ſufficient of it ſelf for the production of the Humane Nature, as alſo of the nature of other Animals.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Species</hi> of Animals are eternal, not upon the account of an eternal ſucceſſion by ordinary propagation, but by that ſucceſſion that would ariſe in certain great Conjunctions of the Heavens, and the heat of the Sun, which would be productive of the Individuals of the ſeveral <hi>Species;</hi> though all the <hi>Species</hi> of Animals were deſtroyed by Floods or other accidents, as poſſibly they might be.</p>
               <p>That although the ordinary Method of preſerving the <hi>Species</hi> of Men and Animals by ordinary Generation, be fitted for the ordinary conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the <hi>Species;</hi> yet without this Method of production out of prepared Earth, Nature were defective, and wanted a ſufficient Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the preſervation of <hi>Species</hi> upon great Occurrences.</p>
               <p>That although this production of Men and perfect Animals <hi>ex putri</hi> be not obvious to our ordinary Experience, it is not becauſe the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition wants truth, but becauſe 1. Every place is not fit for ſuch a production, but where there is a conſtant and ſufficient heat, duly to prepare and digeſt the Matter. But the likelieſt place for ſuch production is ſome unknown place between the Tropicks, where the heat is great and conſtant. 2. Becauſe the maturation and ripening of ſuch Productions require longer time than that which is ſufficient for the production of Inſects: for we ſee greater Animals, even with all the advantages of the <hi>calor uterinus,</hi> require a longer time for their formation and maturation; as, a Man nine months, an Elephant two years; and conſequently, their productions without this <hi>auxilium uterinum</hi> muſt require longer time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:64147:136"/>Then he gives us a large account touching Inſects, that ariſe <hi>ex pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tredine,</hi> and yet are of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> with thoſe that are produced <hi>per coitum;</hi> and that when they are produced <hi>ex putri materia,</hi> yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate ſucceſſively Individuals of the ſame kind: and that if greater Animals were thus produced, they would be of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> with the like Animals propagated <hi>per generationem ordinariam,</hi> and would accordingly propagate their kind; as many Herbs and Trees ariſe ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly, yet are of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> with others that are <hi>per ſeminationem,</hi> and produce Seed, and thereby continue their <hi>Species</hi> as well as others that ariſe <hi>per proſeminationem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I take to be the effect of his Poſition and his Reaſons, which are very learnedly and ſmartly refuted by <hi>Fortunius Licetus,</hi> in his firſt Book <hi>de Spontaneo Ortu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet there was one difficulty which <hi>Caeſalpinus</hi> doth not at all, as I remember, obviate, which yet renders his Suppoſition utterly inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; namely, ſince the Heat and Influences of the Heavens, even in their ſuppoſed extraordinary Conjunctions, muſt needs be uniform at thoſe times, and in or near thoſe Climates wherein they happen, how comes it to paſs that the ſame univocal Heat doth produce at that time any variety of Animals? why ſhould it not produce only Men, as the beſt of Animals, rather than Horſes, Tigers, Lions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again on the other ſide, ſince the diſpoſition of all the parts of Terreſtrial Matter is ſo divers, and qualified with infinite combinations of Qualities and Particles, how it comes to paſs, that in theſe great Conjunctions there are not infinite varieties of things produced, but they are determinate in certain Ranks and <hi>Species</hi> of Being; whereas the modifications of the Matter are ſo various and infinite, that the <hi>Species</hi> of things would be infinite, irregular, <hi>Humano capiti cervicem equinam.</hi> So that there ſeems neceſſary ſome ſuperintendent Intellectual Nature, that by certain election and choice determined things in thoſe determinate Ranks, and contained them within it: For the heat and influence of the Heavenly Conjunctions and of the Sun being common and univerſal, and the various Particles of the Earth variouſly modified and qualified, there could never only by theſe means be any determining or containing the <hi>Species</hi> of Animals within any determinate conſtant figures or bounds: And this we ſhall hereafter find neceſſary, when we come to conſider the determination of Inſects alſo in their ſeveral <hi>Species.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, he gives us not any reaſonable Explication by this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> how the diſcrimination of Sexes happen, how all things thus produced come to propagate their kind, and to contain their Productions within the ſpecifick limits of the natures of ſuch Animals; all which were neceſſary to be done, to render his Suppoſition of this natural production of Men or Animals <hi>ex putredine</hi> to be any way tolerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beregardus</hi> therefore in his 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Circulus Piſanus</hi> hath refined and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Caeſalpinus,</hi> and of <hi>Pomponatius</hi> that went before him; and though he can never make out the truth or probability of his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, yet he hath rendred it more tolerably explicable, eſpecially in relation to the forementioned deficencies; I will give the ſum of his Suppoſition briefly, as I underſtand it: And it ſeems thus;</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Calidum innatum</hi> is that <hi>Altrix anima,</hi> and <hi>Princ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64147:137"/>
ſine quo nihil gignitur,</hi> and is the <hi>Baſis</hi> of Life in all things that have it; but yet it is never ſingle, and by it ſelf, but is the firſt Rudiment of Life, and determined by the particular <hi>Species</hi> of Life in every Individual that hath Life: for there is no <hi>vivens</hi> that is not either <hi>Equus,</hi> or <hi>Canis,</hi> or <hi>Vitis,</hi> or ſome other determinate Vegetable or Animal.</p>
               <p>That there are three kinds of this Life wherein it is ſpecifically deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, <hi>viz.</hi> Vegetable, Senſible, and Rational.</p>
               <p>That at leaſt the two former (he means the latter alſo, if he durſt ſpeak out) are raiſed out of certain Seminal Principles, whereby the <hi>Calidum innatum</hi> is ſpecifically determined to this or that Specifical Life.</p>
               <p>That theſe <hi>Semina</hi> are not eternal, becauſe made up of things or <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipia</hi> that are pre-exiſting: this ſeems perfectly to agree with the Doctrine of <hi>Epicurus</hi> before mentioned, whoſe Patronage he ſeems to take in the Perſon of <hi>Ariſtaeus,</hi> yet with ſome Correctives, as is hereafter ſhewn.</p>
               <p>That there were in Nature various kinds of <hi>Calida,</hi> or Fiery Particles, or <hi>Spiritus ignei,</hi> and various kinds of <hi>Humida</hi> and <hi>Frigida;</hi> theſe were eternally floating up and down in ſmall Particles, and variouſly agitated and mingled, which made up by this mixture the conſtituent <hi>Semina</hi> of Vegetative and Senſitive Natures.</p>
               <p>That in this Conſtitution of the various kinds of the <hi>Spiritus ignei</hi> were the conſtituent <hi>Animae vegetabilium &amp; ſenſibilium,</hi> and the various kind of <hi>Humores</hi> were the <hi>Oleum</hi> and <hi>Balſamum vitae;</hi> and according to the variety of theſe <hi>Spiritus ignei,</hi> which were as it were <hi>Seminium naturae,</hi> were the various <hi>Species</hi> of theſe <hi>Semina,</hi> and the various ſpecifical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Vegetable and Senſible Natures aroſe from them.</p>
               <p>That the Compoſition of theſe <hi>Semina</hi> was not meerly fortuitous, as <hi>Epicurus,</hi> but he gives us a more gentle Explication thereof; <hi>Praecipua verò &amp; planè divina est permiſtio iſta, quae in particulas diffringuntur minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimas, &amp; quantum ſatis est ad componendum ſemen misti alicujus aptiſſime coagmentantur, ut non magis quam par eſt, neque minus illud efficient; quippe ſunt naturae ad hoc determinatae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That theſe are the Seeds of all living things, and they were ſcattered up and down in the Earth and Waters; and that therefore every living Being had its proper <hi>Semen</hi> for his Origination there lodged.</p>
               <p>That yet till the Matter wherein theſe Seeds were lodged were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently prepared, there would be no production of Animals by theſe Seeds.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Semina</hi> of Mankind, and of the greater Animals required a greater and more effectual preparation of the Matter, or a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> for their production put of thoſe <hi>Semina,</hi> and therefore required the greater Conjunctions of the Heavens for their production; though ordinary Conjunctions ſerve for the production of Inſects and Vegetables, namely, the regreſs of the Sun.</p>
               <p>That by theſe <hi>Semina</hi> of all living Beings, though the World were eternal, there might be ſucceſſive Supplies and Reparations of Animals and Men; and though the whole <hi>Species</hi> of Men and Animals were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, yet upon the returns of theſe great Conjunctions and Poſitions of the Heavens requiſite for a due preparation of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> in the Earth for theſe <hi>Semina,</hi> their <hi>Species</hi> would be reſtored out of theſe <hi>Semina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:64147:137"/>That the <hi>Terrigenae</hi> might either be produced <hi>adulti,</hi> and ſo able to ſhift for themſelves; or elſe be furniſhed with a convenient nouriſhment from the Earth; or that they might be in their firſt production not like Infants new born, but able to get their livelihood, as ſome young Brutes are.</p>
               <p>Thus we have the Suppoſition of this witty Man alſo, who by the ſuppoſition of theſe antecedent <hi>Semina,</hi> made up of the divers <hi>Spiritus ignei</hi> and <hi>Humores,</hi> hath ſupplied what was wanting in <hi>Caeſalpinus,</hi> or at leaſt better explicated it; and by ſuppoſing this mixture of theſe <hi>Spiritus igneì</hi> and <hi>Humores</hi> in their ſeveral proportions, by ſomething more than a fortuitous means, hath ſomething rectified the exorbitancy of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> though ſtill he ſuppoſe thoſe <hi>Spiritus ignei,</hi> which were as it were the various Souls of thoſe various Seeds, and afterwards of the ſeveral Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals produced by them, were natural and eternal.</p>
               <p>That which ſeems to have given the original ground-work of all theſe Opinions, hath been,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some Expreſſions that fell from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which are before mentioned, that ſeem to give countenance to this Opinion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A proud vanity in Men of Wit, to reſolve all things into Nature and pure natural and neceſſary Cauſes, unwilling to recognize the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Almighty God, and his <hi>Beneplacitum</hi> in the Origination of things, and yet finding too many abſurdities accompanying the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of Eternal Generations of Mankind, <hi>ex ſucceſſivis genitis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But principally the Obſervation of the ſpontaneous production of Inſects and little Animals <hi>ex putri materia,</hi> whoſe ſtructure nevertheleſs is as admirable as the ſtructure of greater Animals; and that they alſo being thus originally produced, yet propagate their kind by ſucceſſive Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, have diſtinction of Sexes and Faculties: This, it ſeems, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally gave ſtart to this Opinion touching the like Origination of Mankind and greater Animals by a natural ſpontaneous production.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this Inſtance of the natural production of Inſects is that, which as it probably gave the riſe to this Opinion for the like production of Mankind or other Animals, and ſeems to be the only experimental Inſtance that is given to aſſert the poſſibility or probability of the other, I ſhall conſider it largely under theſe ſeveral Examinations.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. IV.</hi> Concerning Vegetables, and eſpecially <hi>Inſecta Animalia;</hi> whether any of them are <hi>ſponte orta,</hi> or ariſe not rather <hi>ex praeexiſtente ſemine.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are ſeveral Ranks of Being in this inferior World, which have various ſpecifical Degrees or Ranks of Perfection one above an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>The firſt diviſion of them is into things Inanimate, and things that are Animate; wherein the latter have another, and a nobler Form, or (if that Word be diſliked) Nature than the former.</p>
               <p>Of things Animate there are three diſtinct natures, the latter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtill not only in degree but in kind, perfection, and excellence of nature the former; namely, things vegetable, that have ſimply Life, with thoſe operations incident to Life. The ſecond ſenſible, that have not only a Life of vegetation, but a Life of ſenſe, and faculties, and operations correſponding to it. The third rational or intellectual, that hath not only a Life of vegetation and ſenſe, but an intellectual Life, and faculties and operations ſubſervient and ſuitable to that Life.</p>
               <p>Among Vegetables, as to the purpoſe in hand, there ſeem to be two kinds or degrees: Some are the more perfect, which do not ordinarily ariſe but from Seminal Particles immediately derived from the Vegetable, either the Root, or the Branch, or the <hi>Semen formatum</hi> of theſe Vegetables; as an Apple-tree, or a Roſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others ſeem to be leſs perfect, becauſe they ſeem oftentimes to ariſe equivocally neither from Seed, Root, or Branch of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> as well as from it.</p>
               <p>But even in all theſe there are none but ariſe from a vegetable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and not barely from what is inanimate; and for the moſt part, if not altogether, from a vegetable Principle or <hi>Semen</hi> of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſeems that the upper ſuperficies of the Earth at leaſt, is plainly a Vegetable Nature; and that it is no more forcible Argument to ſay that the Graſs of the Earth, Nettles, Docks, Thiſtles, and ſuch like common excreſcences are no more ſpontaneous productions in the Earth, than the Feathers upon Birds, or the Hair upon Beaſts or upon the Heads of Men are a ſpontaneous production: for though theſe are excrementitious, and not really parts of the Bird, Animal, or Man, but growing in the Pores of the Skin, and having the Roots there as the Graſs or the Thiſtle hath in the ſuperficies of the Earth; yet they grow, and are nouriſhed from that vegetable power that is in the nature of Animals: ſo that they are but vital Excreſcences from a vital portion of the Earth, namely, its Superficies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, it ſeems that there is ſcarce, if at all, any Vegetable that is in the Earth, but it ariſeth <hi>ex praeexiſtente ſemine ſpecifico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Semina</hi> of Vegetables are of two kinds, according to their ſeveral natures; ſome are formally Seeds, thoſe <hi>Moleculae ſeminales,</hi> that are the choiceſt ſpirituous parts of the Vegetable moulded up into a ſpecifical
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64147:138"/>
Seed: And hence it is, that ſome ſmaller ſorts of Herbs that yield a natural Seed dye the Winter after they have produced; partly, becauſe they have as it were performed their truſt that Nature committed to them for the preſervation of their kind; but principally, becauſe they have delivered up into the Seed that Vital Particle which maintained their own Life when they had it: And therefore ſuch Herbs, if their ſemination be prevented by being cut, ſurvive to the next Year.</p>
               <p>And theſe Seeds are very numerous and various, and many times very ſmall, whereby they are many times accidentally tranſplanted into great remote diſtances: for Inſtance, ſometimes by Floods of Water and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Winds, ſometimes by Birds, ſometimes by Beaſts, who taking them in among groſſer nutriment, and by reaſon thereof, and of their ſmalneſs, eſcaping without maceration, they retain their ſeminal nature in their very Dung; and ſometimes by Exhalations, for the Exhalations will ſometimes lift up things of ſome bulk, together with the watry Vapours: we have ſeen it rain little grains like Rye, which upon ſearch have been found Seeds of Ivy: and therefore thoſe ſmall <hi>Moleculae,</hi> that are almoſt imperceptible, may with much more eaſe be raiſed, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted as it were by the motion of the Clouds into other places or Countries, which may be conjectured to be fortuitous, and yet are truly and really univocal. This <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 19. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. of the Herb <hi>Laeſerpitium,</hi> whoſe Seed was tranſported, and ſowed in a ſtrange Country by a ſtorm of Rain.</p>
               <p>Again, there be ſome Seminal Parts of Herbs and Trees which produce their kind, though without that formal Seed whereof we have ſpoken; and commonly ſuch Seminal Parts are either of the more imperfect ſorts of Herbs or Trees, or elſe a very great coacervation of the Parts of thoſe that otherwiſe require a more regular Seed.</p>
               <p>There is ſcarce any Tree but theſe three parts are actually prolifick of of its kind; 1. The Seed: 2. The Root: 3. The Branch or Buds, with inciſion into another Tree or Stock: the Branch of an ordinary Apple will not grow being ſet in the ground, but the Branch of a Willow, Codling-Tree, or Vine will take root being ſet in the ground. The Oak will not ordinarily grow but by the Seed or Root implanted; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience ſhews us that a woody ground of Oak, or any other Wood which hath ſtood long, and is after felled, will run to Oak again, though the Root be dead; a great quantity of the Leaves, Wood, <hi>Cortex</hi> or Rind putrified in the ground will leave a <hi>Seminium</hi> in it, which will after turn to a Wood of Oak again. And many Plants have all their Parts Seminal, though not ſo vigorous as the regular <hi>Semen</hi> of thoſe Plants; the Branches and Leaves, nay if we believe thoſe that pretend to have tryed it frequently, the Decoction, Infuſion, Aſhes of ſome Herbs ſcattered in good Mould and well watered, will produce their proper <hi>Species. Vide Kircher. in Mundo ſubterraneo.</hi> And I do perſwade my ſelf, that the common Dew exhaled from ſome ſorts of Herbs or Weeds, but eſpecially from the common Graſs, carries with it the Seminal Tincture of the Herb, which being again deſcended by Dews or Rain upon the bare and naked Earth, re-produceth the ſame <hi>Species;</hi> and hence it is that Graſs, which is the ordinary fruit of the Earth, and therefore moſt viſited with the Dew of Heaven, and re-exhaled again, doth moſt
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64147:139"/>
ordinarily re-produce Graſs. And therefore Virgin-Earth taken out of the bottom of a Well and kept in a Houſe, will, if at all, be very long before it will gain that Veſture; but expoſed to the Air, where the Dew or Rain falls, it will ſoon be green, as thoſe that have tryed it affirm; Sir <hi>Francis Bacon's,</hi> Nat. Hiſt. <hi>Cent.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 117. and upon the ſame reaſon it is, that (as the ſame Author there obſerved) forein Earth will incline to bring forth Herbs of the ſame Country whence it was brought, becauſe probably impregnated with the Seminal Particles of the Country whence it came.</p>
               <p>It is true, many times Plants and Herbs, though ariſing by a ſpecifical <hi>Seminium</hi> of their own Herbs or Plants, will ſeem to change their figure, and become of another kind; as by tranſplanting wild Flowers or Herbs into Gardens where the mould is better, or <hi>è converſo,</hi> the poorneſs or richneſs of the Soil varies the ſhape or extent: Thus ſome ſay Corn will degenerate into Tares; Fruits will degenerate, being fown: And again, mixture of Seeds, or Seeds impregnated with Tinctures of other Seeds or things may change their ſmell, colour, taſt, or figure. But in all theſe Tranſmutations, whether for the better or the worſe, ſtill the Seminal Specifical Principle remains.</p>
               <p>So that it may ſeem that we are too haſty and inconſiderate, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that all Trees and Herbs not produced <hi>ex ſemine formato,</hi> are therefore <hi>ſponte nata:</hi> for there be infinite means of tranſplantation of real Seeds, and very many <hi>Seminia</hi> or Seminal Particles of Vegetables that we know not. I do remember, many Years ſince, I found in a Ground that had no Oaken Trees in it, nor very near it, yet every Year abundance of young Oaks growing up ſome two, ſome three Inches high; and I thought them to be all <hi>ſponte nata,</hi> and concluded an Oak to be of another nature than I formerly thought: But Obſervation cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my miſtake; for I found the Crows fetching the Acorns from a Wood not far off, and when they had eat what they pleaſed, they hid the reſt for their future ſupply, but forgot them, and the next Spring they proſpered into young Oaken Plants. We are not therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to conclude every Vegetable <hi>ſponte natum,</hi> becauſe we ſee not its proſemination.</p>
               <p>But the Conſideration of Inſects is that which is of more congruity to this preſent purpoſe, becauſe they are ſenſible Beings, and have in their little Model almoſt, if not altogether, all the Organs and Faculties of the greater Animals; yea and Phantaſie and Imagination, and Memory, as appears eſpecially by Bees and Ants, who find their ways home from a great diſtance. But yet we muſt ſay, that their Faculties and Organs, though admirable, yet are not of equal perfection with thoſe of the nobler kind of Animals, as will appear more hereafter.</p>
               <p>They alſo that ſeem to have their Origination <hi>ex putrido,</hi> or ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly, yet it is evident to Experience that they do propagate their kind; contrary to what was thought by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Book <hi>de Gen. Animal. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. who ſuppoſeth, <hi>At verò quae non ex coitu ſed ex putri materia oriuntur, ea generant quidem, ſed genus diverſum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And touching theſe Inſects, though they ſeem to be <hi>ſponte orta,</hi> yet there is much may be ſaid that their Original is not ſpontaneous, but that even thoſe Inſects that ſeem <hi>ſponte orta,</hi> ariſe one of theſe ways:
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64147:139"/>
1. Either immediately, <hi>ex ſemine prioris Inſecti ejuſdem ſpeciei;</hi> 2. Or mediately, <hi>ex hujuſmodi ſemine;</hi> Or, 3. <hi>ex vivo animali diverſae ſpeciei;</hi> Or, 4. <hi>ex mortuo animali diverſae ſpeciei, ſeu cadavere:</hi> For ſome think that it is not eaſily grantable, that a Being endued with Senſe can by the courſe of Nature ariſe from a Being without Senſe, or at leaſt without Life. <hi>Vide Kircher. l.</hi> 12. <hi>Mundi ſubterranei; Fortunium Licetum, de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe; many of thoſe Inſects that ſeem to be <hi>ſponte orta,</hi> do indeed immediately ariſe from the <hi>Semina</hi> of Inſects of the ſame kind: for theſe Inſects for the moſt part <hi>ex coitu</hi> do produce an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable multitude of little Eggs or <hi>Semina,</hi> that ſometimes in the ſame Year grow to Animals of the ſame kind; and ſometimes their <hi>Semina</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in ſome Cranies or Coverts of the Earth, or Trees Leaves, or other Receptacles that ſerve for the <hi>Seminium</hi> or Store of the next Spring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Malpighius,</hi> that hath made a curious diſquiſition touching the Silk-Worm, tells us, that the uſual product of that Worm in one Year is never leſs than 300, but moſt often 500 Eggs, moſt of which <hi>foecunda;</hi> and the like is viſible in Caterpillers, Flies, Worms, Frogs, Locuſts, Waſps, and all other Inſects.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Winter deſtroys moſt of theſe Inſects, and many of their <hi>Semina,</hi> and therefore the colder the Winter is, the leſs the next Spring is infeſted with them: But many of theſe <hi>Semina</hi> are preſerved till the next Spring, and then they aſſume their ſpecifick Life by the heat of the approaching Sun.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Semina</hi> being very ſmall and light, are many times diſperſed into other places by the Winds, ſometimes carried away to other places by Waters and Floods, ſometimes exhaled into the Air with the groſs Vapours drawn up by the Sun, and poured down by Rain again on other places. And this multitude of theſe little <hi>Semina</hi> thus diſperſed, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming in the Spring their natural kinds, give Men occaſion to think them <hi>ſponte orta;</hi> whereas in truth they do as really ariſe <hi>ex ſemine ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifico,</hi> as the greater Animals.</p>
               <p>And therefore credit is hard given to the Story of <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> or of the Poet out of him, concerning the Mice ariſing in <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the Slime of <hi>Nilus;</hi>
                  <q>Altera pars vivit, manet &amp; pars altera tellus.</q>
Neither to the confident <hi>Helmont,</hi> in his Tract <hi>De Imagine Fermenti im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praegnante maſſam Seminis, pag.</hi> 113. who tells us, that if a foul Shirt be put within the mouth of a Veſſel where there is Wheat, that in the ſpace of 21 days it will turn the Wheat into Mice; nor that other Relation of his in the ſame place, that the Herb Baſil being bruiſed, and expoſed to the heat of the Sun ſome days, will breed Scorpions.</p>
               <p>And as concerning the productions of Inſects out of Vegetables, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe little Animals that are bred in Flowers and Herbs, there are ſome that think they are not the natural production of the Vegetables, but that they are the ſmall <hi>Semina</hi> of thoſe Flies that are lodged in the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of them; ſuch as are in the Leaves of Elms, or in the Leaves or Fruits of other Herbs or Trees, as in the Oak-apple, the Haſel-nut, and ſome others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:64147:140"/>And beſides theſe formal Seeds, the ſeveral parts of Inſects have alſo their Seminal Nature in them, and produce often Inſects of the ſame kind; ſee for this the whole Tract of <hi>Kircher</hi> in his <hi>Mundus ſubterraneus, lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; ſeqq.</hi> wherein he gives us the Solution of the <hi>ortus ſpontaneus</hi> of the Barnacles in the <hi>Orcades</hi> and other Parts, by the Eggs of the Sea-Fowls that are driven upon this Shore; and many Inſtances of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial production of Inſects out of the macerated Materials of Worms, Frogs, Locuſts, Shell-Fiſh, Scorpions: whereby it appears that all their Parts are ſeminal, though not ſo active and formative as their Formal Seeds are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the mediate production of Inſects, yet out of the Seminal Natures of others of the ſame <hi>Species:</hi> Thus out of the <hi>Fimeta</hi> of Horſes, Oxen, and Sheep ariſe <hi>Scarabei</hi> or Beetles, and according to <hi>Kircher, ubi ſupra,</hi> Bees have their production out of the <hi>Stercus Bovis;</hi> which yet he attributes to thoſe <hi>Moleculae ſeminales</hi> depoſited in thoſe Flowers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Cows do feed, but not ſo macerated in the digeſtion but that they retain their primitive Seminal Nature; though perchance this may be too remote and laborious a reduction, and poſſibly it were better to be reduced to that which follows, namely, from the <hi>Animal vivum;</hi> upon which account he ſuppoſeth, that Ants are <hi>Humanae urinae proles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore the third Original of Inſects is from the living Body of another Animal, whoſe excrementitious parts do naturally breed Inſects, as Lice, Fleas, Worms; yea and according to the Author's Obſervation, there is ſcarce any noyſom Diſeaſe in the Body but it breeds Worms: yea and according to a late curious Anatomiſt, <hi>Kirkringius,</hi> there are ſcarce any <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the Body of Man, but hath many ſorts of Worms in it. And the Solution of theſe Productions ſeem to be thus:</p>
               <p>That the Senſitive Nature being diviſible, communicates it ſelf in various degrees unto all that is united to the Body; the Chyle, the Humors, nay the very Excrementitious Parts, the natural Excrements, the Urine, the Hair, the excrementitious Sweat and Evaporations carry along with them the mean and low <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Senſible Nature or Animal Spirits.</p>
               <p>That theſe <hi>Effluvia,</hi> when they are cloſed up in any viſcous Continent that may contain and keep them together from being preſently diffuſed and waſted, aſſume the form of an Animal, though not of the ſame nature, nor worth, nor excellence, nor perfection of the Animal it ſelf that produceth it: for the meaneſt and baſeſt <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Animal Soul accompany theſe mean and baſe <hi>connexa</hi> of the Animal Body, namely, the foul Humours and Excrements. And hence it is, that thoſe naſty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, as Lice, Fleas, Cimices, the Worms in the Inteſtines or Ventricle, nay in the Heart, Liver, Ears and other parts of Men are bred: and from this participation of thoſe baſer <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Animal Spirits, the Hairs of Horſes lodged in ſtanding Water will gather life, and the form of an Inſect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the <hi>Animal vivum</hi> thus communicates a Senſible Nature to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects produced from it, ſo doth the <hi>Cadaver</hi> or dead Body: Hence come generally Worms, which in the heat of the Sun ſometimes turn into Flies; and according to the Tradition of the Ancient and Moderns, Bees grow out of the dead Bodies of Cows, Waſps and Hornets of Horſes;
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64147:140"/>
which nevertheleſs ſome attribute to a <hi>refiduum</hi> of thoſe Seminal Particles of the very Inſects which theſe Beaſts devour, with the Flowers and Herbs where they are lodged.</p>
               <p>And to maintain that general Suppoſition before inſiſted upon, That <hi>Viva &amp; ſentientia non generantur ex non vivis &amp; ſentientibus;</hi> they ſay, That even in the <hi>Cadaver</hi> there remain certain Animal Spirits, <hi>tanquam in vaſe,</hi> which ſerve for the production of Animal Natures of this baſe and low allay.</p>
               <p>And ſo in all thoſe productions of Inſects <hi>ex animale vivo vel cadavere,</hi> the <hi>Semen</hi> of that Inſect is a Vital and Animal Principle, though it be not, immediately at leaſt, of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p>And becauſe theſe Productions are not immediately of the Seminal Particles of the Inſect, but of a living nature of another kind, therefore always the <hi>Productum</hi> or Inſect is of a different, baſer, and more imperfect nature than the Producent.</p>
               <p>And this is the Sum of what is obſerved by <hi>Licetus, de Sponte ortis,</hi> and <hi>Kircherus, ubi ſupra, viz. Lib.</hi> 12. <hi>Mundi ſubterranei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet though much of this be very true, and that Inſects are not therefore <hi>ſponte nata,</hi> as people think, yea they are never <hi>ſponte nata ex non viventibus;</hi> yet I do doubt that it may be found by experience, that ſome ſorts of Inſects do ariſe from Vegetables, at leaſt of a very exalted nature: for the truth is, that ſome ſort of Vegetables ſeem to be in the next degree to the loweſt ſort of Inſect Animals, as may appear in the Plant called the Senſitive Plant and ſome others: And therefore it is not impoſſible but ſome ſort of Inſects may ariſe immediately out of ſome ſort of Vegetables, as the <hi>Gurgulio,</hi> that ariſeth in the Wheat; the Wivel, that riſeth in the Malt; and the <hi>Hippuris</hi> or Horſe-tail, and the <hi>Liburnus</hi> or White Vine, that <hi>Kircher</hi> himſelf mentions in the ſame 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Book, Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. to grow into an Inſect in the Water; and thoſe Inſtances in the ſame Chapter of <hi>Franciſcus Corvinius,</hi> that in every Vegetable had obſerved a proper Inſect bred in it, and living upon it; and the experience of the growing of Moths out of the Seeds of Lavender, and Worms in Roſe-Cakes: theſe experimented Obſervations ſeem to correct the univerſality of the Aſſertion, that <hi>Non naſcuntur Inſecta animalia ex non animalibus;</hi> though I think it may be univerſally true, that they are not produced <hi>ex non viventibus,</hi> they are always the production of the <hi>Semen</hi> or Seminal Particles of an Inſect, or of the Parts of an Animal or <hi>Cadaver animalis,</hi> or of that which is or was vegetable.</p>
               <p>Yet ſome there are, that think that theſe <hi>Inſecta animalia</hi> that ſeem to be produced immediately <hi>ex herbis, ſtirpibus, arboribus, &amp; vegetabilibus,</hi> or Animals of another kind; yet the firſt <hi>Seminium</hi> of theſe <hi>Inſecta</hi> are either the <hi>Semina,</hi> or the Seminial Particles of Inſects of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> percolated through the various parts of Vegetables or Animals: In ſo much that <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> that inquiſitive Naturaliſt ſeems to think, that the very Lice and Fleas and Worms in a Man, are but the Productions of the ſeveral Seeds of Animals of the like kind; <hi>Cum in eodem homine ex ſordibus capitis Pediculi, ex ſordibus barba Alae, inguinis Ricini, ex intercutaneo humore Cyrones oriantur, &amp; ita de caeteris; quonam alio id referamus quam ad diverſa ſemina quae à diverſis ſive plantis ſive animalibus proliciantur, &amp; ſeſe ad diverſas partes quatenus congruunt, recipiant, accommodántve inter nutriendum?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:64147:141"/>I do not here take upon me a diſtinct and exact Diſcourſe touching production of Inſects, it is one of the moſt abſtruſe, curious, and various Inquiries in Nature: There be many that have buſied themſelves on purpoſe in it, to which any one may have recourſe, as <hi>Cardanus</hi> in his Book <hi>de Subtilitate,</hi> and <hi>ſcaliger</hi> his Animadverſions thereupon; <hi>Gaſſendus in Phyſicis, ſect.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Kircher. l.</hi> 12. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1, <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Aldrovandus, per totum; Fortunius Licetus,</hi> his Book <hi>De Ortu Sponte naſcentium; Voſſius, De Origine Idololat. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 65. <hi>&amp; ſeqq.</hi> All that I ſhall ſay farther in it, is but this:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it is moſt certain that many of thoſe productions of Inſects which Men ordinarily take to be ſpontaneous, are yet in truth univocal from Inſects of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> their formal Seeds or Seminal Particles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it is not certain that any production of Inſects is ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous, or not from the Seed of other Animals that were of the ſame <hi>ſpecies:</hi> for we are not certain, but that the <hi>ſeminia</hi> or Seminal Particles of theſe Inſects may be percolated or derived by divers <hi>Maeanders</hi> and long obſcure paſſages into or through the Bodies of Vegetables or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of another <hi>ſpecies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that it is very probable that they are ſo traduced by theſe experimental Aſſays that have been either experimented by Obſervation, or by Art; whereby it is rendred evident to Senſe, that their production at this day may be, and often is of the <hi>ſemina</hi> or Seminal Particles of Inſects of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence whereof is, That the production of all theſe little Particles of Senſitive Life, as well as of the greater Animals, though at the firſt it were <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> by the Power and <hi>Fiat</hi> of Almighty God; yet ſince that time it may be probable they have their propagations uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal, <hi>Ex ſemine vel ſeminio praeexiſtentis Inſecti ejuſdem ſpeciei, vel formato vel analogo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Conſideration may aſſure us, That the production at leaſt of the generality of Inſects which ſeem to be ſpontaneous, is truly ſeminal and univocal; though poſſibly upon a ſevere diſquiſition it may be found, that ſome are meerly ſpontaneous and equivocal Productions <hi>ex putri,</hi> whereof I ſhall give a farther account in ſomething that follows, eſpecially in the next Section.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. V.</hi> If it be ſuppoſed that any of thoſe Inſects at this day have their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> or <hi>ſpontaneè;</hi> whether yet the ſame may be ſaid a Natural or Fortuitous Production.</head>
               <p>I Come now to the Second Particular, which is this; That admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there were any ſuch production of Inſects at this day, whether the ſame were purely Natural: Wherein I ſhall briefly ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it ſeems very probable, that the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Inſects were at firſt in their firſt Creation determinate and certain; and although ſince partly
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64147:141"/>
by degeneration, partly by various mixtures their <hi>ſpecies</hi> are changed and multiplied, even as the perfect Animals in <hi>Africa,</hi> are by a mixture of <hi>ſpecies,</hi> yet they were at firſt determinate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it ſeems the production of the firſt Inſects was like to that of perfect Animals: they were not produced <hi>ex ſemine,</hi> or <hi>per proceſſum ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalem,</hi> whether <hi>ex Ovo</hi> or <hi>ex Verme,</hi> but were produced in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of their ſpecifical and individual exiſtence. For it is much more ſuitable to Reaſon, and to the nature of things, that the Animal ſhould have an antecedence to the Seed, and that the <hi>ſemen</hi> ſhould be rather the effect of an Animal at firſt than an efficient; or according to <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>'s Diſcourſe, that the Hen ſhould be before the Egg, rather than the Egg before the Hen.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That yet if we ſhould ſuppoſe that in the firſt production of Inſects at leaſt, they ſhould ariſe <hi>ex praeexiſtente ſemine,</hi> or that at this day they ſhould ariſe <hi>de novo;</hi> yet bare Matter were not poſſibly ſufficient for its production, without ſome Seminal Principle that might determin the Inſect to its kind, and advance in it that formation and organization of Parts, and effect thoſe admirable Faculties of Senſe and Imagination which we ſee in them: For it were exceedingly above the bare activity of Elementary qualities, though the moſt active, as that of Heat, to raiſe ſo curious and admirable a Fabrick as the Bodies of thoſe little Animals, much leſs the Faculties of Life, Senſe, and Imagination. And if it were poſſible that ſome of the qualities and diſpoſitions, or modifications, or temperament of Matter could arrive to the production of any ſuch little ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Being; yet it could never be contained, nor contain it ſelf within any determinate <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kinds, but as the modifications, temperaments and qualities of Matter are infinite and various, according to its various Mixtures and Combinations, ſo the Productions would be ever irregular, monſtrous, and never colligated or contained in any certain <hi>ſpecies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remains therefore that in the firſt production of Inſects, whether at this day, or in the firſt eduction of their <hi>ſpecies,</hi> if they were not produced in the complement of their individual and ſpecifical nature, they muſt neceſſarily be produced <hi>ex aliquo ſemine congruo, &amp; determinante mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly the Conſtitution of ſuch a <hi>ſemen</hi> is, as I have before obſerved, a work of great Wiſdom, Intelligence, and Power, no way leſs than ſuch a Power that muſt have made an Individual of the ſame kind in his complete exiſtence. For the <hi>ſemen</hi> of every thing contains in it the ſmall <hi>idea</hi> of that Nature which it is to produce; which is as it were minted and ſtamped upon it, and contains an admirable power of evolving and dilating it ſelf, and bringing forth that admirable Fabrick, and that ſingular Conformation of Parts, and thoſe wonderful Faculties of Life, Senſe, and Imagination, and the ſeveral Organs and Operations belonging to it.</p>
               <p>Some there are that have ſaid, and with very great truth, That the ſmalleſt Animal in the World ſets forth the Wiſdom and Excellence of the great Architect of the World more conſpicuouſly than the Fabrick of the greateſt Whale or Elephant: as the ſmaller an excellent Watch is (if it have all its parts, motions, order, and conſtancy) it more ſets forth the skill of the Artiſt than a greater Fabrick. When a Man ſhall ſee in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64147:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Animal that well near eſcapes his ſight by reaſon of its ſmalneſs, as the <hi>Acarus,</hi> the <hi>Cyro</hi> or Hand-worm, yet he ſhall plainly by the help of a Microſcope behold in it all the conformation of its little Limbs uſeful for its being; all the Operations of Senſes and Organs thereof; the ſeveral Faculties, Offices, and Parts ſubſervient to it; the ſeveral <hi>Viſcera</hi> that ſerve for the exerciſe of Life and Senſe, it muſt needs render the Skill of the Author thereof admirable. But yet again, when poſſibly the Seminal Principle of this little Animal bears it may be as ſmall a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to it as the Inſect it ſelf doth to greater Animals, it may be a little imperceptible Egg; and yet in that little Body all the Ideal parts of this Animal and that Principle that immediately conforms the ſeveral Faculties and Organs of this little Animal: The Power and Wiſdom that conforms ſuch a little <hi>ſemen</hi> is no leſs wonderful, than if it had immediately conformed the <hi>Animal</hi> without the intervention of ſuch a Seminal Particle.</p>
               <p>And therefore moſt certainly the Conformation of theſe little <hi>Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae ſeminales,</hi> if any be antecedent to the production of theſe Inſects, is a work of intelligence, choice, election, deſign, and that of a moſt wiſe and intelligent Being; and cannot be the production either meerly of Chance, as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> would have it; nor of that which little differs, namely, an ignorant, unknowing, unelective Principle, for ſuch is barely Nature, unleſs they that uſe that denomination mean by it Almighty God.</p>
               <p>And when I aſſert that theſe <hi>Moleculae ſeminales</hi> antecedent to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of any living or ſenſible nature, if there be any ſuch, are produced by Almighty God; it is not my meaning, that they are therefore imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately created, or immediately put together or compounded (by the immediate Finger of God) if I may uſe that Expreſſion to render the ſenſe I intend: But it is ſufficient, that the great and ſupreme intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Being having in his infinite Wiſdom the Proſpect of all things, hath ſo ſet and ordered the Motion of Second Cauſes, to bring together and mingle the conſtituent Materials of theſe <hi>ſemina,</hi> and he by his Almighty <hi>Fiat</hi> hath annexed to ſuch Compoſitions, and imprinted upon them the ſtamp and efficacy of a Seminal Principle; it will be equally the Work of Almighty God if theſe Compoſitions be brought together by the Motion and Heat of the Sun, or by the powerful Motion and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of various kinds of Ferments; ſome poſſibly originally created, and diſperſed in the Earth, Air, and Waters; others accidental, ariſing from the corrupted and mingled Matter of diſſolved Animals and Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, whereof I ſhall in due time, God willing, give a more diſtinct Account; as if they were immediately created out of nothing: But the Mint, the Stamp, the Signature, the Seminal Efficacy of this <hi>Molecula ſeminalis</hi> is the Intention, Election, and <hi>Fiat</hi> of the glorious God, and can never be the bare production of a ſurd unintelligent nature. So that although it ſhould be granted, that the excreſcence of thoſe <hi>Inſecta ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malia</hi> is not at this day from the <hi>ſemina inſectorum,</hi> but that both in the firſt production of them in Nature, and the yearly or daily production of them now, they were <hi>ex ſeminibus non ex inſectis deciſis;</hi> yet thoſe <hi>ſeminia</hi> or <hi>ſeminales moleculae</hi> were not meerly natural, as Nature imports a ſurd production of things, but were the Work and Intention of the great and glorious God of Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:64147:142"/>So then we may hereby ſee what would be purely natural in theſe <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,</hi> what not. 1. It were thus far natural that the material Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles thereof poſſibly might have an exiſtence in Nature before their Compoſition; whether theſe Particles were partly thoſe <hi>Ignei ſpiritus;</hi> and partly thoſe <hi>Humores primogenii</hi> that were interſperſed in Nature, or poſſibly the conſtituent Eſſentials both of the <hi>ſemina</hi> themſelves and of the Individuals produced by them. Again, 2. They might be thus far natural, that the immediate Inſtruments of the conjunction of theſe <hi>Particulae ſeminales</hi> might be the Heat, or Influence, or Motion, or Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Heavenly Bodies, or what other natural Inſtrument the Divine Power might employ in their Coagmentation. 3. They would be thus far natural, that when theſe <hi>Particulae ſeminales</hi> were conjoyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made up into their <hi>Moleculae ſeminales,</hi> and when they had received their Signature, their Energy by the Divine <hi>Fiat,</hi> they would naturally produce their Effect, <hi>viz.</hi> the production of an Inſect, when they had obtained a convenient <hi>Menſtruum</hi> to lodge it, and the kindly Heat to ripen them; this would be as natural as any Operation of Heat or Cold, or other things are natural; which though they had their firſt exiſtence by the Supernatural Power and Will of God, yet when they are in their exiſtence they move and act according to that nature which is put into them, which is the Law of their Being, given them by Almighty God.</p>
               <p>But the Virtue that gives theſe <hi>Moleculae ſeminales</hi> their Energy of Productiveneſs, of Life and Senſe, their Determination in their ſeveral <hi>ſpecies</hi> and Ranks, that mints and ſtamps them as it were with their <hi>Eſſe ſpecificum ſeminale,</hi> is the Inſtitution and <hi>Fiat</hi> of the Divine Will and Ordination.</p>
               <p>So that if there be at this day any <hi>ſemina</hi> of <hi>Inſecta animalia ex non inſectis</hi> which gives them their ſeveral determinate <hi>ſpecies</hi> and natures, though I am not of the mind of <hi>ſcotus,</hi> that they have an immediate Creation by God, yet I am not of the mind of <hi>Beregardus,</hi> who thinks they are meerly natural, and made up and put together without the Pre-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, Ordination, or Signature of the God of Nature; as the firſt power communicated to the primogenial natures of Animals and Men, to have a <hi>Vis Seminativa</hi> and <hi>Prolifica</hi> was in the firſt Creation of Mankind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them by virtue of the Divine Inſtitution and Benediction, though the way of exerting that Power, when produced, was natural.</p>
               <p>But poſſibly much of what is in this Chapter is needleſs, if in truth the individual natures of Inſects were at firſt created by God, without any pre-exiſting <hi>ſemen</hi> (as we are ſufficiently taught, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.20, 25.) and that the Seminal and Prolifick Power was given to them as other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and conſequently the <hi>ſeminia viventium</hi> were ſubſequent, and not antecedent to the firſt Inſtitution of the Animal Nature, and an effect thereof.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. VI.</hi> Suppoſing the Production of Inſects were totally ſpontaneous, equivocal, and <hi>ex putrido,</hi> whether any Conſequence be thence deducible for the like Production of perfect Animals, but eſpecially of Men.</head>
               <p>IT is true, that Inſects, and thoſe equivocal Generations, have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable perfection in their kind, not much unlike to thoſe that we find in the more perfect Animals, and indeed they are ſo much the more admirable, becauſe their little and almoſt imperceptible <hi>moles</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders their diſtinction of Faculties and Organs the more curious and artificial.</p>
               <p>They have their ſeveral Faculties, the Senſes of Sight, Hearing, Touch and Taſte; they have the digeſtive, egeſtive, and other parts of the Nutritive Faculty; and though their individual production may ſeem equivocal, and of no univocal Seed of the ſame kind, yet they have the Generative Faculty, and propagate their <hi>ſpecies</hi> as well as perfect Animals, and have therein diſtinction of Sexes, as appears by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent experience, notwithſtanding the doubt or contrary Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and although their Phantaſie is more lubricous and ſickle than perfect Animals, yet it is evident that they have a Phantaſie, as appears by their Motions and little Operations; and as they have Phantaſie ſo they have Memory, as appears by the Returns of Bees and Piſmires to their homes from great diſtances: And as they have theſe Faculties of Life and Senſation, ſo they have Organs accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate and admirably fittted to thoſe ſeveral Faculties, namely, to Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Augmentation, Generation, Senſe, Local Motion, Phantaſie, Appetite, which are ſo far from being contemptible, in reſpect of the ſmallneſs and petiteneſs of theſe little Animals, that indeed in ſome reſpect they are the more admirable, as a ſmall Watch is an evidence of greater skill and artifice than a greater, or as a ſmall Picture drawn to the Life commends the skill of the Painter ſometimes more than a great Draught. But yet for all this, we muſt not think that theſe little Animals are of an equal perfection with the greater and nobler: <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Image drawn upon a Cherry-ſtone is a piece of great curioſity, but not of an equal perfection to his lively Statue in Braſs, or that a Fly is of an equal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with an Eagle. Therefore I ſhall not fetch Arguments againſt the like ſpontaneous Productions of the greater Animals from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible valuation of theſe ſmaller, and theſe little Models of ſenſible Life; for certainly they are curious and elaborate <hi>automata,</hi> in reſpect of their admirable minuteneſs and accuracy: But yet upon other Reaſons it ſeems utterly inconſequential, that becauſe theſe ſmaller Particles of ſenſible Nature may be thus ſpontaneouſly produced, therefore theſe greater Animals may be ſo; for it is apparent, that in things of an equality of perfection, there is by the Laws and fixed Rules of their ſeveral Natures ſeveral manners of their productions. If we ſhould compare Vegetables among themſelves, ſome will ariſe <hi>ex ſurculo</hi> as well as <hi>ex radice</hi> or <hi>ex ſemine,</hi> others will not; if we compare Senſible Natures among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64147:143"/>
that ſeem to have an equality of perfection, as ſome ſorts of Brutes and Birds, it will be hard to ſay which have the perfecter Nature, yet the production of the latter are <hi>ex ovo,</hi> the former <hi>ex verme;</hi> the former oviparous, the latter viviparous in the ordinary courſe of their natural production; and as at this day the former is not producible <hi>ex Ovo,</hi> ſo the latter not producible without it. The ſeveral natures of things have diſtinguiſhed them, as in their kinds, ſo in the manner of their production; and whatſoever the perfection of Inſects <hi>ſponte orientia</hi> may be, there is no Conſequence to be drawn from the ſame to other more noble Animals.</p>
               <p>But again, as there is no Conſequence to be drawn from the one to the other, ſo there is in the very nature of the one kind and the other, and in the natural order of their production a great diſparity and diſproportion: ſo that in truth by the very Conſtitution and Frame of their Natures, the perfect Animals that we ſee only produced by the conjunction of Sexes and univocal Generation, cannot by any courſe or conſiſtency in Nature (without the Suppoſition of Divine Power and Ordination) ariſe ſpontaneouſly: And that appears 1. In the diſparity of the natural Productive Principle of the one and the other; 2. In the diſparity of the natural Method of the perfecting of the one and the other; 3. In the diſparity of the Natures of the Animals of the one kind and the other, having arrived to their complement and perfection.</p>
               <p>Firſt, touching the diſparity of the natural Productive Principle of the one and the other; although it be admitted that Inſects and <hi>ſpontaneè orta,</hi> do or may ariſe from a <hi>Semen</hi> or Principle that is not univocal or formal; yet it muſt needs be agreed that the Natural Principle of ſuch their production muſt be ſome analogal <hi>Semen,</hi> or ſome Seminal Principle that is ſuitable to ſuch a Production, otherwiſe <hi>quidlibet orietur ex quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet;</hi> there muſt be ſomething that muſt determin the Matter to be an apt <hi>Seminium</hi> for ſuch a Production, or elſe the Matter muſt determin it ſelf; either there muſt be ſome determinate Vital or Spiritual Principle that is determined in it ſelf, and determins the Matter (which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſeems to hold, that Bodies were firſt Spirits; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, when he tells us, that <hi>Animarum omnia plena,</hi> and when the Matter is fitly prepared, there is an illapſe of this Vital, Formative, Spirital Principle into it) or elſe the inherent qualities or diſpoſitions of Matter it ſelf muſt be of force to mould it ſelf up into theſe <hi>Moleculae ſeminales,</hi> the Formative Principles of theſe <hi>ſponte orta,</hi> (I ſpeak in the Language of thoſe that erroneouſly hold no higher Principles but ſuch as are purely Natural.) But although ſuch Seminal Particles as theſe may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the production of Inſects, yet they are not naturally accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated for the perfection of the perfect Animals: For the <hi>Semen prolificum</hi> for the production of perfect Animals muſt receive its ſpecifical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Principle, either by the Supernatural Power of Almighty God, or from the Specifical Nature of the Individuals of both Sexes; and if we could ſuppoſe an <hi>Anima vaga</hi> of the Senſible Nature, not confined to any Individual of the ſame nature, nothing could be a Matter fitly prepared for its reception but the <hi>Materia ſeminalis ex individuis elicita:</hi> neither is there any Matter, <hi>extra compoſitum animale,</hi> capable to advance it ſelf to the nature of ſuch a perfect Animal; for if either of theſe could
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64147:144"/>
be done, we had as much reaſon daily to expect the like ſpontaneous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Horſes and Sheep, as we find of Frogs and Worms.</p>
               <p>Again, the <hi>Vis conformatrix</hi> and Seminal Particles of Inſects is moſt plainly in Inſects not confined to the <hi>ſemina formalia utriuſque ſexus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixta,</hi> for we ſee almoſt all their parts are ſeminal, and will by putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction advance to the production of their kind: Their productive power is not ſo ſtrictly and ſeverely bound to the <hi>ſemen utriuſque ſexus:</hi> Many have told us by experience and obſervation, that the Excrements of Flies, without any mixtion, will produce immediately Flies; that the Reſolution or Maceration of Frogs and Worms will reproduce Individuals of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> as <hi>Kercher, lib.</hi> 12. <hi>Mundi ſubterranei,</hi> tells us.</p>
               <p>But there are no parts of perfect Animals that are productive of their <hi>ſpecies,</hi> but the ſame is confined by the Laws of their Nature to a <hi>ſemen formale ex utroque ſexu deciſum.</hi> It is true, that their parts corrupted, as their Blood, Fleſh, or Veins, will produce Inſects and living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a different and baſer kind than themſelves, as Worms, Lice, Fleas, Flies, but they can never advance to the production of their own kind.</p>
               <p>And the Reaſon is, becauſe there is not poſſibly any tranſmiſſion of that ſpecifical vital formative Principle to any other part but the <hi>ſemen formale</hi> of the Individuals of that <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and that <hi>Vis formatrix activa vitalis &amp; ſenſibilis</hi> muſt be communicated either by virtue of a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of all the parts of the Producents, or by a kind of a ſpecifical Idea, naturally produced by that Nature from whence it is derived, which evolves and expands it ſelf being produced, or (which is more intelligible and probable than either of the former) by a participation of the vital and ſenſible Soul to the <hi>ſemen prolificum</hi> from the Producents, and there is no way of communication thereof in perfect Animals, but only to that natural and genuine <hi>Semen</hi> conſtituted, mixed, and ordered according to the Law of its Being; ſo that we cannot ſuppoſe any ſeminal Principle of perfect Animals, but this <hi>ſemen prolificum utriuſque parentis,</hi> unleſs we ſhall <hi>gratis,</hi> and without either Reaſon or Example, wholly invert the natural order of things, and ſubſtitute a <hi>Semen</hi> contrary to the nature of the things that muſt be produced, or admit that which thoſe great Aſſertors of Nature think below them to grant, and will rather ſuppoſe a thouſand Abſurdities than admit, namely, the Interpoſition of the Divine Power.</p>
               <p>And 2. As the <hi>Semen formativum</hi> of perfect Animals is greatly differing from that of Inſects, and therefore not capable of a ſpontaneous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction as theſe, ſo it is apparent, that at leaſt <hi>in animalibus viviparis</hi> it is impoſſible to be preſerved, <hi>ſine receptaculo naturae congruo, ſcilicet utero foemineo.</hi> The vital particles thereof are more fiery and volatile, and higher advanced than that <hi>Semen</hi> that is or may be ſufficient for Inſects, <hi>&amp; ſine convenienti receptaculo avolabunt ſpiritus vitales, &amp; ex interventu vel minimi frigoris mortuum &amp; infoecundum evadet;</hi> but the <hi>Semina</hi> of Inſects are more viſcous and leſs volatile, in ſo much that their <hi>Semina</hi> will remain all the Winter in caverns and holes, and yet be fruitful the next Spring.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, the <hi>Semen Inſecti</hi> being ſo ſmall a Particle, and having as I may ſay ſo ſmall a portion of Soul in it, is ſoon formed and brought to maturity: We may learn this in their univocal productions, or <hi>ex coitu,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64147:144"/>
Scaliger</hi> tells us, <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 191. <hi>l.</hi> 2. that the Gloworm brings forth his Eggs <hi>poſtridiè poſt coitum; Malpighius</hi> in his curious Diſquiſition touching the Silkworm tells, that <hi>quarto post coitum die</hi> the Female brings forth ordinarily above 300, ſometimes above 500 Eggs, and theſe will lie all the Winter, and with the warm heat of the Spring and ſome other aſſiſtance will prove vital, the next Spring; and <hi>Ariſtotle, Hiſt. Animal. l.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. tells us, that <hi>Araneae statim poſt ova parta incubant, &amp; triduo peragunt, &amp; quatuor ſeptenis diebus juſta accipiunt incrementa; &amp; ibid. l.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. tells us, that <hi>Mures ſi ſalem lambunt pariunt ſine coitu,</hi> and that even their young have been found with young before they ſaw the light. By all which it is evident, That although theſe little <hi>Moleculae ſeminales</hi> will retain their fecundity longer than the Eggs of Birds, even a whole Winter, and poſſibly longer; yet when they have obtained a convenient <hi>Matrix,</hi> and the warm cheriſhing heat of the Spring, the formation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and maturation of Inſects, and of that <hi>Semen prolificum</hi> which they univocally yield in their regular production is ſpeedy and haſty; and conſequently, that ſpontaneous Seed by which they may be produced, and the ſpontaneous production it ſelf is ſoon diſpatcht and perfected, a ſmall portion and continuance of heat and time may perfect the whole proceſs.</p>
               <p>But it is otherwiſe in the perfect Animals, eſpecially in thoſe that are <hi>Vivipara,</hi> a long time is required for their formation and maturation, notwithſtanding the great advantage of the place, and heat, and ſupplies of their formation and ſupport, namely, the <hi>Uterus foemineus.</hi> Thus the ſame <hi>Ariſtotle, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Hiſtor. Animal.</hi> gives us an account, whereof ſome go above 18 Months, as the Elephant; ſome 10 Months, as Cows and Mares; ſome 5 Months, as Sheep and Goats; the leaſt about 2 Months, as Dogs and Wolves: and this is one Reaſon that <hi>Ariſtotle, Problemat. ubi ſupra,</hi> gives, why theſe perfect Animals are not producible <hi>ſpontaneè,</hi> nor <hi>ſine conjunctione maris &amp; foeminae, vel ſine utero foemineo.</hi> Theſe <hi>Uteri terreſtres</hi> fabled by <hi>Lucretius</hi> would never be warm or cloſe enough for the production of thoſe Animals who naturally are producible <hi>in utero foemineo,</hi> and the intervening Winter would ſoon make them abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, eſpecially on either ſide of the Tropicks, where the heat and cold have their viciſſitudes: And therefore it was providently, though ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly ſuppoſed by <hi>Ciſalpinus,</hi> that <hi>Ethiopia</hi> muſt be the only native Country for ſuch ſpontaneous productions of the greater Animals and Men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the Earth was not a fit or competent <hi>Arvum genitale</hi> for vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous Animals, ſo the nouriſhment, increaſe, and ſupport of theſe vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous Animals, <hi>dum in uteris morentur,</hi> according to the very exigence and formation of theſe <hi>Embryones,</hi> cannot conſiſt with any ſuch ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Productions: for beſides the ſoft and warm <hi>involucra</hi> of the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios,</hi> we know the very fabrick of their nature hath given them a means and Inſtrument of Nutrition, <hi>per venam umbilicalem ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem maternum attrahentem &amp; dirigentem:</hi> This could never be ſupplied from any Terreſtrial Veins, unleſs we ſhould ſuppoſe that <hi>Succus mutritius</hi> of the Earth to become menſtruous, and converted into Blood or other ſuitable conſiſtence for the nouriſhment of the <hi>Embryo,</hi> or without any Reaſon or Experience warranting it, ſo ſuppoſe that ſome other way of nouriſhment ſhould be <hi>in Embryonibus terrigenis.</hi>

Again, <hi>poſt partum viviparorum, praecipuè generis humani,</hi> it is evident that naturally the <hi>foetus</hi> is weak, unable to ſupport it ſelf without the ſupplemental helps; care and ſuperintendence of their Dams or Parents: ſome are blind, as Whelps or Kitlins; ſome are deſtitute of thoſe tegu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are neceſſary to defend them againſt the cold, as many kinds of Birds, that ſtand in need of the hovering of their Dams Wings for a conſiderable time after they are hatched, and are utterly unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their own food, but are hourly ſupplied by their Dams, without which they muſt neceſſarily periſh: and generally all viviparous Animals that are of univocal production are for a long time fed by their Dams Milk, without which, or ſome other artificial proviſion ſubminiſtred to them by the help of others, they could not ſupport themſelves after their production; as young Horſes, Dogs, Calves, Lambs: But this is much more conſpicuous in Humane Infants, who from the time of their Birth for many Months can neither go nor ſtand, nor procure their own food, but ſtand in need of the care of others to keep them warm, provide them covering, and preſerve them from being deſtroyed with their own Excrements. But on the other ſide, thoſe ſmall Animals which are ſuppoſed to be ſpontaneouſly produced, ſtand in need of no other means for their preſervation, being produced, but that heat and circumjacent <hi>menſtruum</hi> by or in which they are produced: and although theſe ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous productions, being produced, ſeem to propagate their <hi>Species</hi> by the coition of their Sexes, yet for the moſt part theſe generated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, Mice excepted, retain ſtill that natural <hi>indoles</hi> to preſerve themſelves, without any other ſupervenient aſſiſtance than what was at firſt ſufficient after their equivocal production; this we daily ſee in the Eggs of Silkworms, of all ſorts of Flies, Caterpillers and Worms, which though in their ſecondary productions by Generation, yet being ripen'd to foetation by the heat of the Sun, they live upon Leaves and Graſs, and take their food without the care or aſſiſtance of thoſe Parents that produced them; and carry along with them the indication of that Method of Life which might be conſiſtent with the condition of a ſpontaneous production, which is no way competible to the condition of greater Animals after their production.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again, though the Faculties and Organs of a ſenſible as well as a vegetable Life appear in the ſmalleſt Inſects, yet it is but a weak and imperfect Life of Senſation, and very little advanced above the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Nature. And this appears by very many Inſtances, as namely, in their generation many Inſects do ſeem to ariſe from Vegetables without any other production; and they ſeem to be little elſe but the <hi>Flos vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilis naturae,</hi> the more pure, active, lively <hi>Effluvia</hi> thereof; as the Flies that grow in the little <hi>Veſiculae</hi> of the Leaves of Elms and Currants, the Worms in the Galls of Oaks and the Burrs of Wild Roſe, the Worms and Flies which grow in the husks of Burrs; yea many times the Parts of Vegetables divided from the Stock will turn into Animals, as the Seeds of Lavander kept a little warm and moiſt, will turn into Moths; the Plant called the Horſe-tail laid into Water, will grow into an Inſect. 2. This alſo appears, that as the ſeveral parts of Vegetables, the Leaves, the Branches as well as the <hi>formatum ſemen,</hi> are ſeminal, and productive of their <hi>Species;</hi> ſo many times the parts of Inſects carry with them a
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64147:145"/>
Seminal Nature effectual enough to produce their <hi>Species,</hi> as hath been aſſerted by the Experience of many; which no way happens in perfect Animals. 3. This alſo appears in the manner of their Life; for we often ſee in Inſects divided each part keeps its motion, as the ſeveral parts of Vegetables keep their animation; a Fly or Waſp whoſe Head is cut off, yet the reſidue of his Body will live a conſiderable time; Flies that ſeem dead either with Water or Cold, and continue ſo for ſome conſiderable time, by the Heat of the Sun or warm Embers will revive and return to Life and Motion; as a Branch torn from a Tree, that hath been ſevered from it three or four days or more, will reſume Life by re-implantation and the Solar Heat: And whereas the Eggs of a perfect Animal, as of Hens, Geeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will loſe their Animatick Faculties being frozen or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete with Cold, or being kept two Months or thereabouts: the Seeds of Inſects will continue fruitful a whole Winter or more, and poſſibly as long as the Seed of Corn, Oaks, or other Vegetables; as is apparent in the Eggs of Flies and Silkworms, which though excluded in the laſt Summer will remain fruitful, and produce the Inſect this Spring, and poſſibly ſome time after; ſo that they are in the next degree above Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, and have a nature very analogal to them. But theſe things are not ſo in greater Animals of an univocal generation; this alſo appears in the great diſparity of theſe degrees at leaſt of perfection in the perfect Animal, above that of Inſects of a ſpontaneous production: For though, as before is ſaid, theſe little Animals have Faculties conformable to the Senſitive Life, ſo that we may plainly diſcover, at leaſt in many of them, the Faculties as well as the Organs of Senſe, Phantaſie, Memory, Common Senſe, Appetite, Paſſion, Local Motion; yet the more perfect and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal Animals have greater ſtrength and perfection in theſe Faculties, their Phantaſie and Memory more exact, their Appetite more perfect and free; if I may ſo call it, they are capable of Diſcipline, which theſe ſmaller Animals are not: There is greater variety, complication, and curioſity in the ſtate, frame and order of their Faculties, and a greater diſtinction and variety of operation in them than in the ſmaller Pieces of Nature. There are more Wheels, more variety and curioſity in their motions, more variety of ingredients into the Conſtitution of the <hi>Automata</hi> of the more noble Animals, than in the Inſects that are <hi>ſponte orta:</hi> ſo that for the Conſtitution of their Souls (the Principle of their Faculties and Motions) there is required a more curious, elaborate, and elevated Compoſition and Fabrick than in theſe minute Animals. And hence it is, that though it be not only poſſible but frequent that theſe Inſects and minute Animals may thus ſpontaneouſly ariſe, yet it hath never been known ſo according to the ſetled Laws and Order of Nature: It is impoſſible theſe greater and nobler Animals can ariſe ſpontaneouſly, nor otherwiſe naturally than by the mixture of both Sexes, and a <hi>Semen formatum</hi> and <hi>prolificum,</hi> received and united <hi>in utero foemineo,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated as it were with that Specifical <hi>Idea</hi> and Formative Power derived from the Parents, and thoſe other acceſſions which may elaborate, rectifie, and advance the Soul and its Faculties, and the Body and its Organs to their due proportion and perfection. And therefore there is no parity Reaſon in the production of Inſects and perfect Animals, nor any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to be drawn from the ſpontaneous production of one, to the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:64147:146"/>
like production of the other in any natural courſe, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a Supernatural free Cauſe effecting the ſame beſides and out of the road and courſe of Nature. And what may be ſaid upon this account againſt the Conſequence of the ſpontaneous production of other Animals from the ſpontaneous production of Inſects, may with much more advantage be ſaid againſt the Conſequence of the production of Mankind by any natural ſpontaneous production; becauſe the perfection of his nature, and the ſpecifical excellence thereof, doth exceed the greateſt excellence of other Animals far more than the nobleſt Animals exceed the Inſects. And therefore as the ſpontaneous production of theſe Inſects no way concludes the like production naturally poſſible in greater Animals, ſo if it were naturally poſſible, and <hi>de facto</hi> true that the greater Animals themſelves were <hi>ſponte producibilia &amp; producta,</hi> it were not at all concluſive, nor deducible from thence that Mankind were producible naturally upon the like account. The nobleneſs of the ſtructure of the Humane Body, the great curioſity and uſefulneſs of moſt of his Organs, eſpecially of his Tongue and Hand; the curious and uſeful configuration and diſpoſition of his Nerves and Brain, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable variety and quickneſs of his Phantaſy, the great retentiveneſs of his Memory, but eſpecially the admirable power of his Intellect, Reaſon and Will give him a far greater ſpecifical perfection above the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Brutal Nature, than that hath above the meaneſt Inſects: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly, according to the ordinary Obſervations in Nature, and the Rules and Methods obſervable therein, requires the nobleſt and moſt advanced Method to produce it that Nature can afford.</p>
               <p>But againſt theſe Reaſons it may be, and is urged, That all theſe Obſervations and Inferences are bottomed upon the ſtate and courſe of Nature, wherein we ſee things are in the ſtate of things already ſetled; but in the firſt production of things it might be otherwiſe, and muſt be otherwiſe, if we admit an Origination of Mankind <hi>ex non genitis.</hi> And though in the ordinary courſe of Nature, as now things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, the production of Mankind is <hi>ex ſemine formato ab utroque parente deciſo,</hi> that his nouriſhment is <hi>per venam umbilicalem,</hi> that it cannot be otherwiſe now but <hi>in utero foemineo,</hi> that the ſtate of Infancy now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires thoſe adventitious helps that are above remembred: Yet in the firſt ſtate of Humane Production all theſe Suppoſitions muſt be laid aſide, as unaccommodate to that ſtate; another Seminal Principle, another method of Nutrition, another ſtate and habit of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> muſt be and may be ſuppoſed in the firſt production of Mankind than now is to be found in the World, wherein the order of things is ſetled in a regular Method. If it ſhould be ſuppoſed that a Mouſe or a Rat were produced <hi>ex putri,</hi> we cannot ſuppoſe any ſuch <hi>Semen,</hi> or <hi>Vena umbilicalis,</hi> or that it lived upon the Dams Milk; all which are notwithſtanding ſuppoſable and neceſſary, when that equivocal Animal afterward propagates its kind.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That as it is true that Mankind and other Animals had an Original, and an Original in quite another way than now it is, and <hi>ex non genitis;</hi> ſo it is unqueſtionably true, that thoſe Proceſſes, Principles, and Methods which now ſerve in the production of Humane Nature or other perfect Animals, are no way conceptible, or applicable unto the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64147:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firſt production of Man or Animals. And therefore I muſt not only grant that theſe Modes of Production, Nutrition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are utterly inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and unapplicable to the firſt Origination of Humane Nature: But I muſt ſuppoſe quite contrary, that in truth it is impoſſible they ſhould be the Modes or Order of that firſt Origination.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be remembred whom it is that I am here contending againſt, namely, not againſt thoſe that do, and that truly referr the Origination of Man to the Divine Power and Will, and a Supernatural production: but againſt them that are the great Venerators of eſtabliſhed Nature, that think it below their Gravity and Wiſdom to recognize any other Efficient but what they find in Natural Cauſes and Effects; nor any other Rule of things but what they ſee, that take their Meaſures of their Conceptions and Sentiments from what is obvious to Senſe, and the common Obſervation of things as they now appear, and for the moſt part frame all their Concluſions accordingly. And therefore that which I herein contend for by theſe Arguments is this, That a Man that duly conſiders the natures of things, and makes the courſe of Nature and the Obſervation thereof to be the Rule and Guide of his Sentiments, though he be drawn by the neceſſity of Reaſon, to grant and conclude that Man muſt needs have an Origination, and that in another way than now he hath, namely <hi>ex non genitis;</hi> yet it is not reaſonable for him to conclude that he had this Origination upon a bare natural account, as the Inſects and <hi>ſponte orta</hi> have, becauſe it quite thwarts and croſſes all the appearances of Nature, and is wholly incongruous to the nature of things as they now ſtand.</p>
               <p>And a Man that makes ſuch a Concluſion muſt needs offer violence to his own Reaſon and Experience, and depart from thoſe Laws and Rules of Nature, which he makes his Guide, and the Compaſs by which he ſteers his Judgment touching things; and ſuppoſe that natural which is wholly different from what it ſeems: And conſequently, if the reaſon and nature of things compel a Man to aſſert that Mankind had their Origination another way than that in which it now is, the ſame reaſon and nature of things duly and impartially conſidered, muſt needs evince that it had not its Origination from any either caſual or meer natural courſe of things: But by the Power and Will of a moſt wiſe, intelligent, bountiful, free, and powerful Being; who according to his Wiſdom and Goodneſs firſt gave being to Man, yea and all other things, <hi>ſecundùm intentionem &amp; beneplacitum ſuae voluntatis.</hi> And ſince it is apparently neceſſary for any Man that will admit the firſt production of Mankind to be totally in another Method than now, and ſince they that will ſuppoſe a natural production of Man at firſt, muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe a different production from that which now obtains: And ſince no more is aſſerted by thoſe that ſuppoſe its Origination by the Will, Power, and Inſtitution of Almighty God; this latter Suppoſition is much more reaſonable and explicable than theirs that ſuppoſe the firſt Origination natural, yet totally different from what now it is, which is the great thing I intend in this long proceſs touching the Origination of Man.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. VII.</hi> Touching the Matter of Fact it ſelf, whether <hi>de facto</hi> there hath been any ſuch Origination of Mankind, or of any perfect Animal; either Natural or Caſual.</head>
               <p>THis I propounded as a diſtinct Inquiry at the firſt, namely, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or how far forth we have any Evidence of Fact touching any ſuch caſual or natural production of perfect Animals, but eſpecially of Man. But the truth is, that this is but an Appendix to the former Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter; for if there be any credible Inſtance of any ſuch Production, all or any reaſoning againſt the poſſibility thereof is but vain; for what hath been naturally or caſually, may be again.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, if in all the Succeſſions of the Ages of the World there hath not been any Experience or credible Inſtance of any ſuch Production; but contrarywiſe, ſince Mankind was firſt upon the Earth, both Mankind and all perfect Animals have had their being by natural Procreation and Generation, by conjunction of Sexes; it is a frenzy for any Man that pretends to Reaſon, to ſuppoſe a natural poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of that to be either from a caſual or meer natural Cauſe; which never had any Inſtance of its being or exiſtence in ſuch a manner.</p>
               <p>The World hath now upon the ſhorteſt Account laſted above 5600 Years, and within the compaſs of theſe Ages of the World there have been in many Nations, eſpecially among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> Men of great Wiſdom and Underſtanding, and ſingular Induſtry to ſearch into the Hiſtory of Nature, and many of them have had great opportunities to know very much therein: and ſince their times, eſpecially the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the wiſer and more inquiſitive ſort of Men being allarmed by the Writings of thoſe that went before them, have made it their buſineſs to ſearch yet farther, and the Learned in all Ages have left the Eſſays of their Learning, Reaſon and Obſervation to ſucceeding Ages, and if any Prodigy or conſiderable Production hath happened in their times, they have ſent us the News of it: But never in all the Ages of the World ſince thoſe 5600 Years hath there been any credible Relation either of the caſual or natural production of a Horſe or a Dog, much leſs of a Man or a Woman happening within the compaſs of that time, abating ſome Poetical Fictions and Fables that have no colour of any Authentick Hiſtory or Authority: And therefore <hi>Scaliger</hi> well ſaith, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 193. <hi>Si bos aliquando ex putri ortus, cur poſt hominum memoriam ex ejuſmodi pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatione nullus extitit?</hi> and therefore <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the wiſeſt Pagan Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher that ever wrote, and the ſtricteſt obſerver and ſearcher into Nature, even upon the account of Experience and Reaſon tells us, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Gen. Animal. cap. ult.</hi> that there never hath been, nor can be, according to the Rules of Nature, any ſuch Production; though by way of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that it ſome times had been, he gives us that <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of it that ſeemed to him moſt likely: And upon this very account, and partly becauſe he was not acquainted with the Truths of God, or at leaſt becauſe he was not willing to acknowledge any other Original of things
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64147:147"/>
but by Nature, he took up the Opinion of his Predeceſſor <hi>Ocellus,</hi> touching the Eternity of the World, and of Mankind in it, and ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the difficulty of the Manner of the Origination of Mankind by denying it.</p>
               <p>And therefore we have no reaſon to believe any ſuch thing, ſince we find nothing in any Authentick Hiſtory of any Man, or perfect Animal, ſince the firſt Being of Man upon the Earth hath been thus produced, abating the Fables of Poets touching the production of Men and Women out of Stones, by <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> caſt over their heads; the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents Teeth ſowed by <hi>Cadmus,</hi> the production of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> out of an Egg, and thoſe forlorn Fables of <hi>Beregardus;</hi> of the Green Man found in <hi>England</hi> in the Den of a Wolf 500 years ſince; the Blew and Red Men of <hi>Rabbi Elcha,</hi> that came out of the Mountains of <hi>Armenia:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for want of any credible or particular Inſtances of any ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, <hi>Caeſalpinus</hi> ſuppoſeth, that they are in ſome unknown Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains between the Tropicks, where the Heat of the Sun is more conſtant, fervent, and equable, than in Climates remoter from the <hi>Equinoctial;</hi> though he neither doth, nor can give any Inſtance of ſuch a production there or elſewhere. To excuſe this unexperienced Notion, and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of aſſigning any Inſtance thereof, they allude theſe enſuing Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That theſe Productions cannot be but under ſome notable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or Poſition of the Heavenly Bodies, which may be accommodate to ſuch Productions; which Poſitions or Conjunctions not happening but after vaſt and diſtant Revolutions, the Experiment it ſelf can rarely happen; and by length of time, before the like Revolution return, it is forgotten.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That thoſe Productions could not be but in Matter excellently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and fitted for this production, which could not be but after ſome great and long continuing Flood or Inundation, that might prepare and diſpoſe the Matter for the Activity of that great Revolution, and if theſe ſhould not meet together, or in ſome convenient nearneſs, the production of Mankind and perfect Animals would be fruſtrated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in as much as provident Nature hath had for many Ages, and yet hath a ſufficient <hi>Seminium</hi> and ſtock, for the preſervation of the <hi>Species</hi> of Men and perfect Animals raiſed by propagation and the mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Sexes, Nature is not neceſſitated to have recourſe to this extraordinary way of peopling and furniſhing the World, and therefore it cannot be expected but after ſome vaſt devaſtation, that may endanger at leaſt the extinguiſhing of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of things.</p>
               <p>To theſe things I ſay firſt in general, That if Men ſhall upon ſuch a Method of Arguing go about to eſtabliſh a Suppoſition, that neither they nor any elſe have ever known or experimented, and make a Concluſion of a thing as natural, upon ſuch Suppoſitions as never any Man knew or heard, to produce ſuch effects, Men may aſſume any thing to be natural, which yet hath not footſteps in Nature bearing any analogy to it. But to the particulars:</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, it is unreaſonable to make ſuch a Suppoſition, for ſince it is not poſſible for any Man to know whether there be any ſuch Influence of the Heavens to effect ſuch productions, unleſs by Experience and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:64147:148"/>
Obſervations of ſome Men, or ſome other way the notice thereof were given to Mankind, it being a Matter of Fact, that can no other way be known but by Experience or Revelation; and ſince the bare beholding of thoſe Heavenly Bodies, being of that diſtance, can never without Obſervation of Events give us any natural eſtimate of their Effects, what they are, or may be; and ſince it muſt needs be granted, that ſuch imagined Conjunctions, as may be effectual for ſuch productions, are at vaſt unknown diſtances, and ſuch as no Age before hath, or indeed can leave us any Memorial of; it muſt needs be a vain and precarious aſſumption, to attribute any natural Efficacy to any Conjunction what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever for ſuch a production. The Ancient and Divine Hiſtorian <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us indeed an account of the Origination of Man, and all other Animals, but not upon any natural cauſation or activity of the Heavens or Heavenly Bodies; but as he gives us the Hiſtory of the Things, ſo he gives us the true Reſolution of the Cauſe, not a natural but a ſupernatural Cauſe, namely, the Intention and Volition of the Great and Wiſe God; and to exclude any imagination of a natural or neceſſary Cauſe of theſe productions; doth not only tell us in expreſs terms, that the production of them was by the Energy of the Divine <hi>Fiat,</hi> but alſo that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction even of Vegetables themſelves, that ſeem to have the greateſt dependance upon Celeſtial Influences, was antecedent to the Conſtitution of thoſe Heavenly Bodies. 1. As the Suppoſition of ſuch a Natural Cauſality in the Heavens is meerly precarious, ſo it ſeems even to our Senſe apparently falſe; for we ſee every year, without any other than an ordinary Conjunction by the Acceſs of the Sun, Inſects and Plants, <hi>ſponte naſcentia,</hi> do ariſe; and we know, that ordinarily in the compaſs or revolution of 800 or 1000 years, very great and conſiderable mutations happen in the Poſition and Conjunction of the Heavenly Bodies; and we know, that within the compaſs of Authentick Hiſtory theſe Revolutions have happened above thrice, and ſince the lateſt <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Worlds Inception above five times; yet none of theſe great Revolutions have for any thing we ever knew or heard produced any one Horſe, or Lion, or Wolf, much leſs any one Man, as a <hi>Terrigena.</hi> And therefore Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience (the beſt means to ſettle ſuch an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi>) doth not only not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it, but is evidently contrary to it, and denies it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond, the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Hiſtory gives us an account of an Univerſal Deluge, about 4000 years ſince, which lay long upon the whole Earth; and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Hiſtory gives us an account of two very great Floods, namely, the <hi>Ogygian</hi> and the <hi>Deucalian</hi> Floods; and every Year gives us an account of the Inundation of <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> a moſt fruitful Continent, and near the Sun, whereby the Soil is made admirably fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and there is ſcarce any Age but ſome great portions of Land are laid dry, by the receſs of ſome parts of the Ocean, which had lain covered for many thouſands of years before with the ſea. And as the univerſal Deluge was as great a preparation of the whole Earth, ſo theſe particular Inundations and Receſſes of the Sea left particular Spots of Land as well prepared for ſuch productions as can well be imagined; and yet in no Age have we any Inſtance of any ſuch production, abating the Story of the <hi>Egyptian Mice</hi> which concrete after the receſs of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which yet of moſt hands are agreed to be Inſects, and <hi>ſponte naſcentia ex putredine.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64147:148"/>
                  <hi>Beregardus</hi> tells us, <hi>ubi ſupra,</hi> out of <hi>Camerarius,</hi> that about <hi>Cayro,</hi> after the reflux of <hi>Nilus</hi> there are often ſeen divers Limbs or Parts of Mens Bodies; whether this be true or no, or if true, whether they are not only relicks of ſome Bodies ſwept away by the Inundations of <hi>Nilus</hi> out of their Graves or Sepultures, and torn aſunder by the furious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts of <hi>Nilus,</hi> is not clearly evident: But be they what they will, or whether the <hi>Luſus naturae,</hi> yet they make nothing to this matter, unleſs <hi>Camerarius</hi> or ſome other had ſeen thoſe <hi>divulſa membra</hi> come together, and configured into an humane Shape, and animated with a humane Life, which neither he nor any other have yet affirmed or pretended.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the Third, I ſay, 1. If by Nature they intend the great and glorious God, that moſt wiſe, intelligent, powerful Being, they do indeed in effect affirm what I have deſigned to prove, but do not make good their Suppoſition of ſuch a Natural Cauſe as they declare in their <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> wherein they mean only that natural connexion and <hi>ſeries</hi> of Cauſes whereby Natural Effects are naturally produced. And if they intend by Nature that unintelligent <hi>ſeries</hi> or order of Natural Cauſes, or the blind and determinate Cauſe of Natural Productions; How comes that Nature to know when and where this neceſſity of Spontaneous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions doth happen, or in what proportion, meaſure, limits or place it is neceſſary to be done? Such a proviſional care requires a knowing and perfectly intelligent Being, that operates <hi>ex cognitione, intentione, &amp; voluntate;</hi> which is not to be affirmed of Agents purely natural, who do therefore act according to a Law of neceſſity and determination; <hi>non ex conſilio &amp; cognitione.</hi> 2. It is plain, that Inſects and Vegetables ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly produced, are produced every Year, and their production is as natural as the acceſs of the Sun and the conſtitution of the Earth: Theſe are procured every Year, whether there be any need of them or not, and poſſibly ſometimes in greater numbers than is convenient for this inferior World. And although it be true, that the Divine Power doth intend, or remit, or manage theſe Productions <hi>ſecundùm regimen &amp; conſilium vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis,</hi> yet it is moſt evident theſe Productions are ordinary, animal, and natural, without choice or deſign in inanimate Nature: If therefore theſe Productions be natural and periodical every Year, why ſhould there not be as well productions of Men or perfect Brutes, if it were purely natural, as well as Frogs and Flies; ſince the former may be of more uſe, eſpecially in many deſolate places, than always the latter? How many great and vaſt Iſlands and Continents are there, eſpecially in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> which have no conſiderable number of Inhabitants, if any at all to people them? In <hi>Ireland</hi> there are great ſtore of Wolves, and ſo there were anciently in <hi>England,</hi> till they were deſtroyed by the Induſtry of the Inhabitants: in <hi>Ireland</hi> their increaſe is by propagation, without any new production; in <hi>England</hi> they cannot increaſe by propagation, becauſe here are none: How comes it to paſs that Nature doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce new Wolves in <hi>England,</hi> as well as Frogs, Adders, Hornets and Waſps? If it be ſaid, that Nature neglects it becauſe they are noxious; as this is to make Nature an intelligent Agent, ſo it anſwers not the difficulty: For why doth ſhe then not deſtroy the <hi>Species</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the ſame account? But this is but a vanity: Nature as well intends the exiſtence of a Wolf as of a Sheep, where the means of its production is
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64147:149"/>
equal, though Mankind prefer the latter, as more uſeful to him. If any thing therefore of this deliberative nature be to be found in the voluntary and intentional Regiments of things of this kind, it is to be attributed to the great and ſupreme Rector of the World, who doth work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Counſel, Wiſdom, and Will.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter therefore I conclude, That as well by the reaſon of the thing, and upon true natural congruity, as alſo <hi>de facto</hi> and upon experimental Obſervations, Mankind, no nor the perfect Animals are not produced, nor producible by any meer natural Cauſe, as at this day, or in any Age or Time ſince their firſt Creation, otherwiſe than by a natural production; which is the Truth aſſerted by the Great <hi>Verulam,</hi> in his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century, <hi>in fine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Heathen Opinion, which was, That upon great Mutations of the World perfect Creatures were firſt ingendred of Concretion, as well as Frogs, Worms and Flies, and ſuch like, we know it to be vain; but if any ſuch thing ſhould be admitted (diſcourſing according to Senſe) it cannot be, except you admit a <hi>Chaos</hi> firſt, and a commixture of Heaven and Earth: for the Frame of the World once in order, cannot effect it by any Exceſs or Caſualty.</p>
               <p>And as thus neither Caſualty nor bare Nature cannot originate Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind or any perfect Animal <hi>ex putri,</hi> ſo much leſs can Art. The Chymiſts tell us, that by re-union of ſeparate Principles of Vegetables they will in a Glaſs revive a Vegetable of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> at leaſt in figure and effigies; this hath been pretended, but I could never hear any Man ſpeak it that ſaw it done.</p>
               <p>But never was any ſo mad, except <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> that could ever pretend to make up a Senſible Being, much leſs the Humane Nature: <hi>Paracelſus</hi> vainly and falſly pretended to the raiſing of an <hi>Homunculus,</hi> but yet not without the help of thoſe <hi>Naturales geniturae utriuſque ſexus;</hi> wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he lyed, as he did in many things elſe, which he never could effect notwithſtanding his vain boaſting of his Skill.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter therefore I conclude, That the Origination of Mankind, or of the inferior perfect Animals, neither was nor could be the Effect of Humane Art or Skill, as <hi>Paracelſus;</hi> nor of Chance or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualty, as <hi>Epicurus;</hi> nor of Nature, as <hi>Cardanus, Caeſalpinus,</hi> and ſome other Recreants in Religion and Philoſophy: But it was the free, powerful, and wonderful Work of the God of Nature, who made all things by his Power and Wiſdom; and having made them, lodged in them and for them that pre-ordained Law of their Creation and Exiſtence, which we commonly call Nature: That Nature indeed is the Law or Rule inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and implanted by the wiſe and glorious God in things when made; but in the firſt Effection of Mankind God Almighty, not Nature, was the Author. As in my Watch, the Law and Rule of its Motion is the Conſtitution and Poſition of its Parts by the Hand and Mind of the skilful Artiſt; but the Author or Efficient of my Watch is the Artiſt himſelf, and not that Motion that is as it were the Law or Rule of the Engin.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. I.</hi> Concerning the laſt Opinion, attributing the Origination of Mankind to the immediate Power and Will of Almighty God.</head>
               <p>IN the foregoing Section and Chapters I have performed theſe things: 1. I have removed the Suppoſition of an Eternal Exiſtence of the Humane <hi>Species,</hi> as altogether incredible, and indeed impoſſible. 2. I have eſtabliſhed conſequently this Truth, That the <hi>Species humana</hi> had a beginning; and this I have done principally upon natural Evidence of the incompoſſibility of an Eternal Exiſtence of ſucceſſive Generations. 3. I have conſidered thoſe Evidences of Fact, or Moral Evidences of the Inception of Mankind, and removed ſuch as ſeem more fallible and leſs concludent, and ſubjoined ſuch as ſeem to be of greater weight. 4. Among theſe of the latter ſort, I have conſidered the general Tradition thereof, both of the unlearned and learned part of Mankind, wherein among others I have conſidered the Opinion of thoſe Famous Sects of Philoſophers, the <hi>Platoniſts, Epicureans, Peripateticks,</hi> and <hi>Stoicks.</hi> 5. Though I have made uſe of their common Suffrage, in order to the Proof of the Origination of Mankind, yet I have not allowed all their ſeveral Notions, or <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> touching the Method or Manner of their admitted Origination of the Humane Nature. And therefore, 6. I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus eſtabliſhed the <hi>Theſis</hi> in general, I have deſcended to the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the particular <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> taken up by various Philoſophers, touching the ſame Origination: And thoſe I have diſtributed into theſe three Ranks; 1. Thoſe that ſuppoſe an accidental or caſual Production of Mankind, which was principally the Opinion of the <hi>Epicureans:</hi> This Opinion I have examined, and rejected as vain. 2. Thoſe that ſuppoſe this Production to be Natural, or by the bare Concurrence of Natural Cauſes, as <hi>Avicen, Cardan,</hi> and ſome others; which I have likewiſe examined, and rejected as utterly inevident and falſe. 3. There remains therefore the third Opinion, that attributes the Origination of Mankind to the immediate Power and <hi>Beneplacitum</hi> of the Supreme Intellectual Being, namely, Almighty God; and this was the Opinion of divers of the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> and <hi>Stoicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Opinion is in the general true, and agreeth not only with the Divine Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but with the exacteſt Meaſure and Rule of Reaſon, and the Light of Nature it ſelf; and as it is utterly impoſſible, that Mankind ſhould be without a beginning, ſo it is utterly inconceptible, that he ſhould have any other Original but this.</p>
               <p>But although this general Suppoſition be thus conſonant to Truth and the Light of Reaſon, yet ſince the Manner of this Origination of Mankind by the Power of God depends meerly upon His own <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placitum,</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:64147:150"/>
which might put forth and exert this Act of His Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, in the production of Mankind according to His good Pleaſure, and the <hi>Arbitrium</hi> of His own Will. And ſince Mankind, having their Exiſtence after this production, could never by his own Senſe perceive or underſtand perfectly the Manner of his own production, and conſequently the particular Method or Manner thereof could neither be attained by Humane Experience nor Ratiocination; we muſt neceſſarily either be utterly ignorant of the Manner and Order of the Divine Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in the Origination of Mankind, or we muſt know it only by Divine, or at at leaſt Angelical Revelation, and not otherwiſe. So that though the general <hi>Theſis</hi> of the Origination of Mankind by Almighty God, be a Concluſion deducible by Reaſon, partly by the remotion of all other means as incompatible and inſufficient for ſuch a production, and partly by the obſervation of the Events and Effects in Nature; yet that this production of Mankind was in this or that particular manner, is a Truth diſtinctly cognoſcible only by Revelation.</p>
               <p>And hence it came to paſs, that thoſe great Searchers into Truth among the Heathens, being either not acquainted with the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or not acquainted with the Divine Authority by which it was written, either delivered their <hi>Theſis</hi> generally, that Almighty God produced Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by His Power and Will, not explicating the particular manner thereof; or if they attempted a particular Explication of the manner, they ran out into very uncertain, various, and contradictory Explications thereof; which muſt neceſſarily be the conſequence of ſuch particular determinations, where Man hath not ſufficient light to guide and direct him. <hi>Zeno Citicus,</hi> the Founder and Prince of the Sect of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> a wiſe and a good Man, contented himſelf with this general Aſſertion touching this matter, as it is delivered us by <hi>Cenſorinus, in Die natali, cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Zenon Citicus Stoicae ſectae conditor, principium humano generi ex novo mundi conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum putavit, primoſque homines ex ſolo adminiculo Divini ignis, id eſt, Dei providentia, genitos. Plato,</hi> as far as we can collect his Opinion out of his <hi>Timeus,</hi> attributes the Origination of Mankind to the immediate Cauſality of an Intelligent Nature: But going further into particulars, falls into conjectures, attributing the Effection of the Soul unto the Great God, but the Fabrication of the Body to the <hi>Dii ex Deo,</hi> or Angels, it ſeems according to the Tradition of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> And this hath been ordinarily the unhappineſs of Mankind, without the light and guidance of Divine Revelation, that if they have at any time happened upon ſome ſound and ſubſtantial Truth, they commonly fix unto it Explications and Additions of their own, which many times, by their inevidence, abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, or incongruity, draw in queſtion the Truth it ſelf to which they are appendicated: Therefore to ſettle, and fix, and quiet the Minds of Men touching their own firſt Origination, and the Origination of this World, it hath pleaſed the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs by the Hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> to reveal unto Mankind, not only that the World and Mankind had their Original, and that they had their Original from Almighty God, as its Efficient both of the Matter and Form thereof; but alſo he hath therein declared the <hi>Series,</hi> Order, and Method of the production of all Things.</p>
               <p>It is true, the two former, namely, That the World had an Inception,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64147:150"/>
and had an Inception from God, is a Truth that by the diligent Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of natural Light and Reaſon is attainable; but the Manner and Order of this Effection is, as before is ſaid, diſcoverable only by Divine Revelation: But yet though the Manner thereof is not diſcernable barely by the light of Nature or Reaſon, without the help of Divine Revelation; yet that Method and Manner once revealed, as it ſtands ſo revealed to us by <hi>Moſes,</hi> carries a very great congruity to Reaſon; which though it cannot at firſt diſcover the Method or Order, yet it cannot chooſe but ſuffragate to the reaſonableneſs and convenience thereof, being ſo diſcovered.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore in what follows do theſe things; 1. I ſhall give an Account of that Method of the Formation of all things, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of Mankind, as it is rendred to us by <hi>Moſes.</hi> 2. I ſhall ſhew the reaſonableneſs and congruity of the Scheme of <hi>Moſes</hi> touching the Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Mankind, both in the general and particular notion thereof, and the prelation that it juſtly hath above all other the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of other Men. 3. I ſhall deduce from the whole certain evident and neceſſary Concluſions, againſt thoſe that deny the Exiſtence and Providence of Almighty God. 4. I ſhall alſo deduce ſome Concluſions evincing the Reaſonableneſs of an intended End for Mankind, or the Deſign of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God in his Creation, and what may be reaſonably concluded touching the ſame.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. II.</hi> The <hi>Moſaical</hi> History touching the production of the World and of Mankind, and the Congruity and Reaſonableneſs of the <hi>Moſaical Hypotheſis.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN that ſhort yet admirable Hiſtory of the Creation delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he gives us an exact Account of the Origination both of Mankind and of the whole World, and therein and thereby he reſolves all the Doubts and Difficulties which troubled the Heads of the wiſe and learned Heathen touching the ſame, and reſolves and extricates all thoſe inconveniences and perplexities under which the various <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the Heathen World infinitely laboured.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He reſolves us, That the World in that Conſtitution as now it is, was not Eternal, no not that part to which the Ancients attributed Eternity moſt, namely, the Heavens; whereby all the Foundations of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, Ocellus Lucanus,</hi> and others touching the ſame, and all their ſubtilties and ſtruglings to ſupport that Eternity, and to deliver themſelves from thoſe inconveniences that attended that Suppoſition are in a few words rendred vain and frivolous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He reſolves us, That as the World in its preſent form and ſtructure was not eternal, ſo neither was the matter thereof eternal; which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>Plato</hi> ſo much, who though he ſuppoſed an inception of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of things into their preſent order, yet could not digeſt an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Matter.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:64147:151"/>3. He gives us an account, That Time or ſucceſſive Duration was not eternal, but had a beginning; and that Motion, whoſe Meaſure Time was, had a beginning, before which it was not; becauſe no <hi>Mobile</hi> was more ancient than the beginning of Time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He gives us an account of a kind of production that the learned Philoſophers knew not, a production <hi>ex nihilo,</hi> by Creation, by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; which breaks and tears in pieces all thoſe petite Axioms and ſuperſtructions thereupon, which they had been long time in weaving, and by which they formed much of their Philoſophical Speculation: As the neceſſity of eternal Matter, becauſe nothing is made of nothing; the neceſſity of eternal Motion, becauſe every Motion muſt have ſome Motion anteceding the nature of poſſibilities; which, and many more being deſumed from Generation as it ſtood in the ſetled courſe of Nature, and fitted and appropriated to it, are no way applicable to the firſt Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Production of Being by Creation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He gives us the true Efficient of Being, and the manner of his Operation, namely, Almighty God, a moſt wiſe, intelligent, and free Efficient; and one that in the firſt production of things did not work <hi>per modum naturae,</hi> or neceſſarily, or as a natural or neceſſary Cauſe, as the Sun produceth Light; but <hi>per modum intentionis, volitionis, &amp; electionis;</hi> for he was before he created his Creation of the World, was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, namely of Time, and created Nature; but he was before that beginning, namely, without all beginning. But to purſue a little more diſtinctly the order of the Creation of things poſitively, and not barely negatively, the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Hiſtory touching the Creation ſeems to be as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in the beginning, the firſt <hi>Apex</hi> of Time which began with the Being of Matter, Almighty God created in one indiviſible moment the firſt and common Matter of all this <hi>Mundus aſpectabilis,</hi> the Heaven and Earth. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in that firſt Creation, and for ſome continuance of time or duration after this common Matter of all things lay indiſtinct and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed together, without any order or diſtinction, expreſſed by thoſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. <hi>And the earth was without form and void, and darkneſs was upon the face of the deep:</hi> And in this common Maſs and <hi>Chaos</hi> were contained the conſtituent Matter of the Celeſtial and Elementary World.</p>
               <p>Which ſalves the Diſpute touching the diſparity of the Matter of the Heavenly and Elementary World, which appears here to be the ſame in kind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this common Matter had theſe deficiencies in it, in and for ſome time after its production.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was without Form and Order:</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was without Light:</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was without Activity, Life, or Motion: and</p>
               <p n="4">4. All that Superficies which it had, bore the greateſt analogy to Water, though in that vaſt Abyſs there was a confuſed mixture of other Matter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Spirit of God moved upon the face of this great Abyſs,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64147:151"/>
                  <hi>[incubavit ſuper abyſſi faciem:]</hi> What this Spirit of God was, whether the eſſential Spirit, the Third Perſon in the Holy Trinity; or whether it were a created Spirit, the Spirit of Nature, or as ſome will have it, the <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> created by God to digeſt, inſpire, and communicate an active nature to this confuſed <hi>Moles,</hi> as ſome earneſtly contend; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Spirit of God were any other than the emanation of his Power, I ſhall not determin: But whatever it was, this Motion of the Spirit upon the face of this Abyſs had theſe great Intentions and Effects upon this confuſed <hi>Moles:</hi> 1. It derived into it motive Powers or Energies, whereby the parts of it were agitated or moved, or at leaſt rendred more obſequious to the agitation and motion of that active nature which was afterward created, namely, Light or Fire. 2. It did gradually digeſt and ſeparate its parts, whereby they became more capable of diſpoſition and order, according to their ſeveral deſigned and deſtined places, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and uſes. 3. It did transfuſe into this ſtupid, dead, and unactive <hi>Moles</hi> certain activity and vital influence, whereby it did in general affect that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls the common Life of Bodies, namely, Motion; and the ſeveral parts thereof were impregnated with ſeveral kinds of vital influence, varied and diverſified according to their ſeveral parts and uſes: As the gentle heat of the Hen ſeems to communicate a vital in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to the Egg, only with this difference, that the heat of the Hen ſeems to excite a pre-exiſting vital principle in the Egg, rather than to give it: But the incubation of this Spirit of God did not ſo much excite, as give a new vital power to the ſeveral parts of the <hi>Chaos;</hi> as the vital Soul in Nature communicates vitality and activity to the Seminal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: And this gives us an account how Activity and active Forms, Powers or Qualities were derived into Matter, namely, not from Matter it ſelf, or ſuch which is meerly unactive and paſſive; but from another Principle, namely, the vigorous influx of this Spirit that moved upon the face of the Water. Whereby it is apparent that the <hi>Vis,</hi> Vigor, Activity or Energy that is in Natural Bodies and in the Univerſe, as it came from no other Principle than Matter; ſo it is an Entity of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct nature from Matter or material Subſtance ſimply as ſuch, and indeed an Entity of a nobler extraction and nature than bare Matter or material Subſtance. So that in this Deſcription hitherto containing the firſt <hi>Stamina</hi> or Rudiments of the Univerſe, we have 1. The Efficient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Almighty God: 2. The manner of his efficiency herein, namely, Creation <hi>ex non praeexiſtentibus:</hi> 3. The Matter of the Univerſe thus by Creation produced, the confuſed <hi>Moles,</hi> containing in it ſelf the Matter of all things: 4. The diſpoſition, or rather indiſpoſition of this Matter, dark, ſtupid, and unactive: 5. The plaſtick, formative, digeſting Principle that pervaded it, the Spirit of God moving upon the face of the Waters.</p>

               <p>The firſt Rudiments of the World being thus laid, and thus prepared and influenced by the powerful Energy and Incubation of this Spirit of God; this divinely inſpired Hiſtorian gives us in the next place the next ſucceeding order of Almighty God, producing and effectually raiſing
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:64147:152"/>
out of this Matter the greater Integrals of the Univerſe, namely, the Etherial and Elementary Nature. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>As in the order of Reaſon, it was but fit and convenient that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and influencing of the Matter ſhould precede the diviſion, and diſtribution, and orderly diſpoſing thereof; ſo it was equally reaſonable and convenient, that the greater and more extenſive parts thereof ſhould be firſt laid out and diſpoſed into their ſeveral ſtations and orders, before the ſmaller and leſſer portions of Nature ſhould be either produced or ſetled; and that the ſimple parts of this great <hi>Chaos</hi> ſhould be firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, before the mixed and compounded Exiſtences ſhould be ſetled. For as the <hi>Chaos</hi> and common Lump of Matter was as it were the firſt Matter of all things, ſo the more ſimple and uncompounded parts thereof, the Etherial and Elementary Natures were as it were the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria ſecunda,</hi> or <hi>proxima</hi> of the enſuing Productions; and in conformity to this firſt Divine Ordination of things, the inſtituted nature of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Beings, he did obſerve the ſame method or order ſtill in the Generation of things. Wherein we may obſerve, that the greater and more comprehenſive Rudiments and <hi>Stamina</hi> are laid, and in ſome good meaſure formed, before the leſſer and derivative parts are formed and compleated; as we ſhall have occaſion to obſerve when we come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>proceſſus generationis</hi> of Man and Brutes.</p>
               <p>And now to come to thoſe greater Productions, which are principally theſe; the Light, the <hi>Aether,</hi> the Air, the Water, the Earth. Firſt therefore touching the Light, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>And God ſaid, let there be light, and there was light; and God divided the light from the darkneſs, and the light he called day, and the darkneſs he called night: and the evening and the morning were the firſt day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herein it might be fit to examin, 1. What this Light was: 2. How it was produced: 3. How it was diſpoſed or ordered; 4. In what order and character of time it was ſo produced and ordered.</p>
               <p>Touching theſe briefly, and firſt touching the nature of this Light. We may obſerve in Fire two great operations or effects, firſt, Heat, ſecondly, Light: It ſhould ſeem that active Element, as it is commonly called, or rather, that powerful, vigorous Entity, or <hi>Vis ignea lucida &amp; calefactiva</hi> was produced by the Incubation of the Spirit of God upon the face of the Abyſs, and diffuſed through the confuſed Particles of the <hi>Materia Chaotica;</hi> and that it was the great Inſtrument which that Spirit did both communicate and uſe for the preparation, digeſtion, and agitation of that Matter: but this fiery nature being mingled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through the Matter, though it had one of its uſeful effects, namely, Heat; yet it neither had nor could have Light, at leaſt till it were in ſome meaſure diſintangled and ſevered from the <hi>Moles</hi> of groſs Matter, with which it was confounded and mingled; and till the lucid and flammeous particles, or rather <hi>Vis ignea &amp; lucida</hi> were lodged in a fit Vehicle for its emiſſion. So that in the work of this day Light was not created, but only a conſiderable part thereof ſeparated from the groſſer Matter, and diſpoſed into an apt Vehicle to contain it. 2. And this anſwers partly the ſecond Inquiry, namely, How it was produced: not, as it ſeems, by Creation; but the powerful <hi>Fiat</hi> of Almighty God called the Light out of Darkneſs, that is, ſeparated and ſevered the moſt lucid
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64147:152"/>
fiery nature, and inveſted them with fit Vehicles deſumed out of the <hi>Materia Chaotica,</hi> whereby great part of that flammeous and lucid fiery nature which was created by the Incubation of the Spirit of God, was in a great meaſure diſcharged from the bond and incumbrance of the groſſer Matter, and rendred uſeful for the beauty and ſervice of the Univerſe; but yet ſo, that there remained ſtill in the parts of the <hi>Moles</hi> a ſufficient ſtock of connatural Fire and fiery Particles for the heating, agitating, and digeſting of their ſeveral parts for their ſeveral uſes and ends. As to the Third, it ſhould ſeem, that 1. This luminous nature was lodged in a ſuitable Vehicle to derive its Light and Influence to the exteriour Superficies of this <hi>Moles Chaotica.</hi> 2. That it was put into a circular Motion, whereby in the ſpace of a Natural Day it viſited the whole <hi>Expanſum</hi> by ſucceſſive rotation; ſo that as by its preſence in any part of the Chaotical Horizon it made Day, ſo by its abſence there-from it cauſed Night, as the Sun doth at this day. And this diurnal Rotation of this luminous Body was really ſuch, becauſe there could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that which the Text ſuppoſeth, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeparation of the Light from the Darkneſs, and thereby the diſtribution of Day and Night; ſo it was convenient, for the better digeſtion and preparation of the remaining indigeſted parts of Nature. For doubtleſs that Light was of a very great and penetrating Influence, being as it were the <hi>Flos</hi> and Elixir of that moſt active and powerful Element. 4. The Time and Order wherein this production of Light was, is ſaid to be the firſt Day: what portion of duration the diſorderly <hi>Chaos</hi> had before this firſt production is utterly uncertain, becauſe not revealed; poſſibly it might be a very long time, but the perfecting of the World in its formal order and <hi>conſtitutum</hi> ſeems to be in the compaſs of ſix Natural Days, and the firſt Days Work is this of Light.</p>
               <p>And although we muſt finally reſolve the ordering and methodizing of all things to the <hi>Divinum beneplacitum,</hi> whoſe Wiſdom and Ways are unſearchable and paſt finding out, farther than he is pleaſed to reveal them; yet it ſhould ſeem to be very conſonant to the reaſon of things, that this eduction and circulation of the Light ſhould begin and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at leaſt for the firſt three Days of the World, without parcelling or diſtributing into thoſe Luminaries of the Sun and Stars: For doubtleſs the collection of this lucid, fiery, active nature into ſo great a Body as probably it was, had even naturally a moſt forcible energy, influence and penetration into the ſubjected <hi>Chaos,</hi> and ſtrangely prepared it for its enſuing offices and uſes. Although we muſt ever with all humility acknowledge, that the Great and Omnipotent God needed not the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary Inſtrumentalities of Nature to compleat his Work, but could do all things immediately, as he did moſt evidently in many of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Nature; yet if he were pleaſed to uſe this order in things, we have reaſon to believe, that though he needed it not, yet when we ſee it done, it was certainly ſo done with moſt exquiſite Wiſdom and Reaſon: He could in the firſt moment have produced the whole World compleat in all particulars, but he choſe not ſo to do, but did things in a ſucceſſive order of ſix Days, and in ſuch a Method as was moſt agreeable to his good pleaſure and infinite Wiſdom. What became of this Fiery Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Nature and Body, we ſhall ſee in the fourth Days Work.</p>

The Second great Integral ſeems to be that great and vaſt Body, conſiſting of the Air and <hi>Aether,</hi> called the Firmament; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>And God ſaid, Let there be a firmament in the midſt of the water, and God made the firmament, and divided the waters which are above the firmament from the waters that are under the firmament, and it was ſo; and God called the firmament heaven: and the evening and the morning were the ſecond day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word that is tranſlated in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> [Firmament] is rendred by Linguiſts underſtanding the propriety of the word, to be <hi>Expanſum</hi> or <hi>Expanſio;</hi> and much controverſie hath been, what is meant by the Waters above the Heavens; ſome ſuppoſing a real exiſtence of Waters above the Starry Heavens, to cool the heat contracted by them or their rapid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; others conjecturing it to be the Clouds, which are above the middle region of the Air: both improbable enough, the former a meer imagination, the latter little more; for, at this time, it is apparent there were no Clouds, neither had it rained upon the Earth. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>It ſeems therefore that this <hi>Expanſum,</hi> rendred here Firmament, is nothing elſe but that limit or boundary between the more refined, liquid nature which we uſually call Air and <hi>Aether,</hi> and the groſſer or fluid Element properly called Water. So the Firmament was nothing elſe but that <hi>Expanſum</hi> of Air and <hi>Aether</hi> that are contiguous to the Superficies of the Water. The Reaſons that induce me ſo to think (which alſo expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Notion of the Suppoſition) are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe frequently both in the Language of the Holy Scripture, and of divers of the ancient Heathen Authors, the whole <hi>Diaphanum</hi> of the Air and <hi>Aether</hi> is in one common appellation called Heaven; which is the denomination here given to this <hi>Expanſum,</hi> (God called the Firmament or <hi>Expanſum,</hi> Heaven:) thus we have frequent mention of the Fowls of the Heavens, the Clouds of Heaven, which yet are ſituated in that part of Heaven, which is the Aiery Region. And again here, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. the Sun and Moon are ſaid to be great Lights placed in the Firmament of the Heaven, which are yet placed in a Region of the <hi>Aether,</hi> though above the Atmoſphere and the region of the common Air, yet are far below that liquid region of the <hi>Aether</hi> wherein the Stars move: and <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. the Fowls habitation is ſaid to be in the open Firmament of Heaven, which yet fly no higher than the lower region of the Air. So that the Heaven, and the <hi>Expanſum</hi> here called the Heaven, ſeems to be that great <hi>Expanſum</hi> of the <hi>Diaphanum</hi> including the more ſublime and pure part thereof called the <hi>Aether;</hi> and the groſſer and lower part thereof called the Air, and the Waters above the Firmament were that refined, rarified, liquid Matter, which was <hi>Aether</hi> and Air; and the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Waters below the Firmament were thoſe groſs and fluid parts of Nature called ordinarily Water.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it appears, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. that the Waters which were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Conſtitution of the Air, were the Waters under the Heavens, Waters that were next contiguous to that common <hi>Expanſum</hi> conſiſting of Air and <hi>Aether</hi> called Heaven, there was nothing interpoſed between that fluid Water which conſtituted the Sea, and that common <hi>Expanſum</hi> called Heaven, conſiſting of Air and <hi>Aether.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſeems that the great <hi>Moles Chaotica</hi> was in its appearance and external conſiſtency of a wateriſh nature; for it is ſaid that the Spirit of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64147:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God moved upon the face of the Waters, which though it contained the confuſed Maſs of all things, as well thoſe that grew into a more ſolid conſiſtence, as the more reformed or ſubtil Matter; yet in its firſt defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med exhibition of its appearance it had the ſhape of Water, and therefore <hi>Plutarch, de placitis Philoſophorum, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. tells us, that <hi>Thales Mileſius</hi> held that Water was the common Principle of all things; which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he learned partly by the Analogy that he found therewith in things exiſting, whoſe firſt Rudiments and laſt Reſolution ſeems to be a watry or fluid ſubſtance; and partly by Tradition from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or rather from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> whoſe firſt habitation was in that Country.</p>
               <p>And the manner of the reſolution of this Aqueous appearance into <hi>Aether</hi> and Air ſeems to be this: This great aqueous Chaotical Maſs contained in it Particles of various natures, ſome more feculent and groſs, as the Earthy Particles, which floated up and down in it till they were driven down by the Fire and Heat, or otherwiſe by ſome diſpoſition <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> or agitation of that Incubation of the Spirit of God, were diſpoſed and ſubſided in the middle of this Aqueous ſubſtance, which became in time the <hi>Moles terrestris:</hi> Other parts leſs feculent than theſe reſided in a Region or Circle next to that groſſer and more feculent Sediment; but by virtue of the Divine Diſpoſal the Incubation of the Spirit and the Energy and Efficacy of that great circulating Fiery Nature, which was maintained in a continued rotation about the <hi>Maſſa Chaotica,</hi> called Light; and that internal, hot, and fiery Nature that ſtill reſided within the Body of the <hi>Maſſa Chaotica,</hi> the more ſubtil and pure particles of this Watriſh Matter were ſeparated, divided, and exhaled from it, and conſtituted that Conſiſtency that is called the Air and <hi>Aether,</hi> here called Heaven.</p>
               <p>And this diaphanous Body of the Air and <hi>Aether</hi> thus extracted from the Water varied in degrees of Subtilty or Rarity, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of its elevation; the more high and elevated parts being more pure, according to the degrees of their aſcent; and the lower more fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and thick, and filled with more groſs Exhalations and Vapours ariſing from the contiguouſly ſubjected parts; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.6. <hi>There went up a miſt from the earth, and watered the face of the ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I am farther induced to think, that thoſe Waters above the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament or <hi>Expanſum</hi> were no other than this <hi>Aether</hi> and Air raiſed and ſeparated from the <hi>Maſſa Chaotica,</hi> upon theſe Reaſons; 1. Becauſe there ſeems to be a great congruity between the Water and the Air, in their quality of liquidity or moiſture. 2. Becauſe there ſeems to be a more connatural Tranſmutation of either into other; the Air, and for ought I know, the <hi>Aether,</hi> which is but a purer ſublimated Air, by condenſation eaſily re-aſſuming the nature of Water, and the Water by heat and rarefaction eaſily aſſuming the nature of Air, and by the continuance and conſtancy of that heat containing it ſelf in that conſiſtency. And from hence it is that the Waters were the common material Principle of both the Fiſhes and Fowls. And if we may conjecture, that great Inundation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1. was not by a new Creation of Water, but by the wonderful and powerful Condenſation of the Region of the Air; which ſeems to be that opening of the Windows of Heaven, whereby great portions of the Aerial and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64147:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Etherial Matter diſcovered themſelves to be Water. 3. Becauſe we have no other part of Holy Hiſtory that gives us an account of the production of that vaſt Continent of the Air and <hi>Aether</hi> out of the Chaotick Maſs but this place. And here we muſt obſerve once for all, That there was no Creation of Matter after the Beginning; it was all created in that moment of Beginning. 2. That from that Creation till the firſt Day, wherein Light was produced, there was that continued preparation, impregnation, diſpoſition, and agitation of Matter by the Spirit of God. 3. That all the Productions of the Six Days (except the Creation of the Soul of Man, and Angels) were not by any new Creation, but by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the parts of that pre-exiſting Matter, formation of them, and compoſition and effection of Beings out of the firſt created, diſpoſed, and ordered Matter, by the Power of Almighty God, and the influencing them with thoſe active Principles which we uſually call Forms, Energies, and Active Qualities.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Third great Integral of this lower World, eſpecially in the Work of the third day, was the dividing of the Earth and Waters, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>And God ſaid, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together, and let the dry land appear, and it was ſo; and God called the dry land earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called ſeas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Divine Hiſtorian herein brings us to the Formation of this lower Globe of Water and Earth, and the diſtinction thereof.</p>
               <p>This portion of the lower World ſeems to be the whole reſidue of the viſible Chaotical Maſs, which by the former Rectification was reduced to a ſmall portion, like the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> after Diſtillation; for out of it had been before drawn thoſe two mighty and large portions of Matter, namely, the Fiery, and Flammeous, and Lucid Nature imbodied in a Vehicle ſufficient to contain and receive it in the Work of the firſt day; and ſecondly, the <hi>Expanſum,</hi> the vaſt Body of the Air and <hi>Aether</hi> in the Work of the ſecond Day.</p>
               <p>So that this Elementary portion of Earth and Water ſeems to be as it were the ſediment and relique of the <hi>Maſſa Chaotica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thoſe other two vaſt Extractions being drawn from it, it ſeems this lower Region of Nature conſiſting of an aggregation of Water and Earth by the Divine Diſpoſition of things, either immediately, or partly by the inſtrumentality either of the ambient Fire, or by the implanted tendency of the groſſer Particles to one common Center of this reſidue of a Chaotick Maſs, the groſs Terreſtrial parts ſubſided into the middle of the Water; and though it was in bulk far greater than the Water, yet it had there two concomitants with it: 1. The Water by reaſon of its fluidity and penetration mingled it ſelf, as far as it could at leaſt, with the ſuperficies of the Terreſtrial Sediment, to ſome conſiderable depth into it, ſo far as it could pierce, until it were excluded by the denſer coagulation of the Earth. 2. The Water did encompaſs the whole Terreſtrial Globe to ſome proportionable depth or thickneſs, though not equal to the quantity of the Earth. So that as the circular Scales of a Pearl incompaſs one another, ſo did the ſeveral ext<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>racted great Integrals cover one another.</p>
               <p>The firſt extracted Nature was the Light, the Fiery or Luminous Body; which muſt needs be uppermoſt, becauſe firſt drawn off from the Chaotick
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:64147:154"/>
Maſs. The ſecond, the <hi>Aether</hi> and Air drawn off, encompaſſing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of the Chaotick Maſs. The third, the Watry Conſiſtence, left in a circular ſubſiſtence by the ſubſiding of the Ball of Earth into the common Center of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>And by this means the Earth was not at all conſpicuous, but involved in an <hi>involucrum</hi> of Water; ſo that it muſt neceſſarily be, 1. That hereby the whole Superficies of the Earth was covered with Water. 2. That the upper part of it muſt needs be a moiſt muddy ſubſtance, fluid and lubricous, like Slime or Mud.</p>
               <p>The appearance therefore of the dry Land was by the excavation of certain <hi>Sinus</hi> and Tracts of the Earth, and exaggerating or lifting up other parts of the Terreſtrial Matter; and by this means the Water ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided into thoſe Caverns and Valleys prepared for its reception: Whether this excavation of the Terreſtrial Body, or elevation of other parts thereof whereby the Water ſubſided, were immediately by the immediate Power of God; or whether he did it by the inſtrumentality of the Water, working room for it ſelf in the more ſoft and penetrable part of the Earth, and exaggerating and raiſing Iſlands and Continents in other parts by ſuch exaggeration; as we ſee is done at this day by the Ocean, producing Iſlands, and enlarging Continents: Or whether by the inſtrumentality of the Fire, either ſubterraneous or ambient, raiſing up the Earth, or what other immediate way it was done; moſt certainly it was done by the Will, Direction, and Regiment of the Divine Wiſdom and Power: ſo that it is truly ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 38.10. <hi>He brake up for it its decreed place: Prov.</hi> 8.28. <hi>He gave the ſea its decree, that the waters ſhould not paſs his commandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto the Divine Hiſtory hath given us an account, 1. Of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria prima</hi> of all Corporeal Beings, the <hi>Maſſa Chaotica:</hi> 2. The <hi>Materia proxima</hi> or <hi>ſecunda</hi> of all other Corporeal Beings being the ſimple Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the next Matter of all Mixtions or Compoſition: 3. The <hi>Natura ignea;</hi> calefactive, lucid, and penetrating the Elementary Matter: 4. The <hi>Natura aetherea</hi> and <hi>aerea,</hi> the <hi>Expanſum:</hi> 5. The <hi>Natura aquea,</hi> or the Water: 6. The <hi>Natura terreſtris,</hi> or the Earth. And then he proceeds to thoſe mixed or compounded Natures, drawn out of thoſe or ſome of thoſe ſimpler Exiſtences, the Furniture of the Earth and Heaven.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore now proceed to his Deſcription of the Production of Mixt Natures and Vegetables, in part of the third day; Celeſtial Bodies in the fourth day; Fiſh and Fowls in the fifth day; Brutes and Man in the ſixth day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore touching the production of Vegetables, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>And God ſaid, Let the earth bring forth graſs, the herb yielding ſeed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind, whoſe ſeed is in it ſelf upon the earth; and it was ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have the beginning of the Vegetable Nature; and mark, what I ſay concerning this, will be applicable with ſome variation to the Brutes and Fiſh. We have three ſorts of Vegetables here deſcribed, 1. Some that ſeem to be of the loweſt rank, and ſuch as we do find often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>ſponte orta,</hi> the Graſs. 2. Thoſe Herbs that are of a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nature, which as they bear Seed, ſo they do not uſually ariſe but by it. 3. Trees bearing Fruit and Seed, being the nobler ſort of Trees;
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64147:155"/>
but this includes all kind of Vegetables, as well Trees that bear not Fruit or Seed, as thoſe which do.</p>
               <p>In the production of theſe Vegetables, theſe things are obſervable:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Supreme Efficient, the Word of Command of the Divine Will was that which was the Supreme productive Efficient.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſubordinate Inſtrument <hi>[germinet terra]</hi> wherein we have theſe two great Truths delivered, 1. That the Earth yielded the Matter of Vegetables. 2. That the Earth was now impregnated to be an active Inſtrument to this production, and concurred therein, at leaſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, with the Supreme Efficient, and that Activity that was in the Earth did not ariſe meerly from the Matter, for that in the beginning was purely paſſive, but 1. by the Fecundating Principle, the Spirit of God moving upon the Face of the Chaotick Matter; 2. by the powerful Energy of the Fiery and Luminous Principle, that partly reſided in the Earth, partly incompaſſed it; 3. but principally by the Efficacy of the Word of the Divine Command, which was no other but the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of His Efficacious Will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But though the more ſolid Matter of theſe Vegetable Productions was the Earth, yet it was the Earth conjoined with that vigorous Fire, which was mingled with that active Air or <hi>Aether</hi> that was interſperſed in it, and that fruitful Water which remained conjoined with it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this Production was not by any formed antecedent Seed diſperſed in it, but immediately, the Vegetable Individuals were ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to any <hi>Semina</hi> that might be productive of it; and according to the true Method of Exiſtence of Things in their firſt Origination, the Herb and Tree were the Cauſe, the Original of the Seed, the Seed was not the Original of the Herb or Tree, though in the ſecondary production by generation the <hi>Semen</hi> precedes the thing generated, according to the Order ſettled after the firſt production of things, which doth reaſonably ſolve the Diſpute of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> Whether the Hen were before the Egg, or the Egg before the Hen?</p>
               <p>And as the Suppoſition, that the firſt Principle in the Origination, either of Vegetables or Senſitives, to be <hi>ex praeexiſtente ſemine</hi> ſeems incongruous and unreaſonable, I mean as to perfect Vegetables or Animals, ſo it is idle and needleſs: For certainly the ſame Infinite Power, that could form a <hi>Semen univocum,</hi> to be the immediate Principle of an Animal or Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, in the primordial Origination of them, could with equal facility form perfect Individuals of the ſeveral <hi>Species,</hi> and endue them with a prolifick power of propagation of their kinds, by ſeminal Principles deciſed from them; and no leſſer Power and Wiſdom was required to mold up a ſpecifical operative <hi>Semen,</hi> than to frame the Individual or <hi>Species</hi> to be produced by it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Supreme Power of the Great Efficient of Vegetables, as well as Animals, was ſeen in this, in that it determined their <hi>Species,</hi> which, Matter alone, nor any Univerſal Cauſe purely natural, could never have done, in reſpect of their univerſal common indeterminate Nature, which could never fix nor ſettle in any determinate ſpecifick production. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in that the Individuals of Vegetables, Fiſh, Fruits, and Birds, as well as Men, were made after their kinds, it aſcertains us, that this Origination of things was by a Wiſe, Free, Intelligent Being, full
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:64147:155"/>
of Power and Wiſdom, acting <hi>ſecundum intentionem electionem, &amp; volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. By virtue of this Divine Intention, Ordination, and Command, theſe three things were ſettled touching Vegetable Natures, (which is alſo true concerning Animals, as to the two latter of them at leaſt) 1. The Earth was endued with prolifick vital Energy, whereby it was enabled with the vigorous aſſiſtance of the Fiery Nature included in it, and accompanying it, to put out many ſpontaneous productions of ſome ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Vegetables, and probably of ſome Inſects, and to exhibit a <hi>ſuccus nutritionis</hi> to ſupport all kind of Vegetables and many Animals in their vital exiſtence, 2. The Individuals of Vegetables of all ſorts, as alſo of Animals, Fiſhes, Fowls, Inſects, and Man, were in a moment of time produced in their full and perfect complement, laden with their Fruit and Seed, without ruining the natural gradual proceſs of Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which was to enſue in the courſe of future Generations; and this could not be done, either by force of any natural fecundity that was then in the Earth, or the bare ſtrength of the formed natural accommodation of Light or Heat; for though it be true, that the natural fecundity and heat of ſome Climates, and alſo artificial fecundations of Matter, may conduce much to the acceleration of Maturity, yet it is hot imaginable, that theſe could be ripened into the full growth and burden of Fruit in the period of a Day, but by virtue of a ſupernatural Efficient and Power, namely, the Energy of the Divine Command, <hi>[Germinet terra, &amp;c.]</hi> 3. The third admirable Demonſtration of the Immediateneſs of the Divine Power, Wiſdom, and Ordination, is this, That Vegetables, as alſo Animals and Mankind, were endued with a Power, Faculty, and a certain Law fixed and radicated in them, to tranſmit their ſpecifical Nature to ſucceeding Individuals by propagation and ſeminal traduction, whereby their <hi>Species</hi> might be preſerved, and this was done by force of the Divine Inſtitution and Benediction; the Vegetables were produced with their various <hi>Semina</hi> in them, ready formed for their ſeveral ſpecifical productions, in their full and perfect ſtature, <hi>quaſi per ſaltum,</hi> and endued with a prolifick power of multiplication of their kind, by virtue of that Soveraign Inſtitution and Commiſſion <hi>[Be fruitful and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, and repleniſh the Earth,] Gen.</hi> 1.22, 28.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I come now to the Fourth Days Work, <hi>Verſe</hi> 14, 15, 16, <hi>[And God made two great Lights, the greater Light to rule the Day, and the leſſer to rule the Night, and he made the Stars alſo.].</hi> It is true what I before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that firſt Matter of all things corporeal was made, and this only was properly Creation or making out of nothing, and all corporeal things, that were made within the compaſs of the Six Days, was Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only <hi>per analogiam,</hi> for it was only ſeparation and diſtribution of that Matter which before exiſted in the <hi>Materia Chaotica,</hi> or elſe an elevation or rectification of ſome parts of that Matter, or a compoſition out of it or of ſome parts of it; it was <hi>effectio</hi> or <hi>creatio ſecunda,</hi> not <hi>creatio prima;</hi> and though the Word <hi>[Create]</hi> be applied to ſome things that were thus effected, as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. yet it is not purely <hi>creatio prima,</hi> or <hi>ex nihilo,</hi> but <hi>creatio ſecunda ex praeexiſtente materia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, What was the Matter of theſe Heavenly Bodies, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, for in this Fourth Day all the Matter of the <hi>Chaos</hi> was
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:64147:156"/>
before diſtributed into theſe four Simpler Natures, Light or Fire, Air or <hi>Aether,</hi> Water, and Earth?</p>
               <p>The firſt Matter of theſe Heavenly Luminaries therefore was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Chaotica materia;</hi> but the <hi>Materia proxima</hi> out of which they ſeem to be conſtituted, were principally thoſe two great Natures which were ſeparated from the <hi>Chaos</hi> the firſt day, <hi>viz.</hi> The Fiery Nature imbodied in a ſuitable Vehicle, and the ſecond day the <hi>Aether</hi> or Aery part: theſe two great Integrals of the firſt Univerſe were far greater than all the reſt of the Chaotick Matter, and therefore might very well ſubminiſter the principal and predominant Matter for thoſe great and vaſt Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries the fixed Stars, the moſt whereof are far greater than the Globe of Earth and Water: But to the Conſtitution of the Planetary Bodies, which ſeem to be more groſs than the Stars, there was a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of more groſs and feculent Matter added to the Fiery and Aerial Particles in their coagulation, though in ſome of them more, in ſome leſs, according to the various degrees of ſubtilty and groſneſs of their conſtitution.</p>
               <p>And theſe goodly Bodies being formed and molded, it ſhould ſeem that that great and mighty flaming Light which was made or produced the firſt day; and for the two enſuing days had rolled about the reſt of the Chaotick Maſs, was by the Glorious God diſtributed into thoſe ſeveral Heavenly Veſſels of the Sun and Stars, who ſucceeded unto, and as it were inherited that primitive Light now divided among them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral meaſures and uſes.</p>
               <p>For although the Almighty Wiſdom and Power could have made all this Fabrick of the World in its full complement and perfection in one moment, and although he produced and perfected Vegetables, Brutes, and Man in one moment, without the gradual procedures through thoſe ſeveral ſtations and degrees which Nature now obſerveth; and ſo he could have done in the production of all other the Integrals of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; yet he ſeems in ſome parts of this <hi>Proceſſus formativus</hi> of the Univerſe to uſe ſometimes ſuch Methods, Means, and Inſtruments, and ſuch Times, Periods, and Orders as might ſeem to bear in ſome meaſure a congruity to a Natural Procedure; thus he uſed that Motion or Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Spirit for the ripening and influencing of the vaſt Maſs; he firſt begins with the production of thoſe more ſimple conſtituent Particles of Matter which might yield Matter ſuited and prepared to Mixt Natures.</p>
               <p>And it is not unreaſonable for us to think that this great flaming Light in the firſt three days of the Creation was uſed as a moſt ſuitable Inſtrument for the Rarefaction, Digeſtion, Separation, and Diſtribution of the remaining part of the Chaotical Matter in thoſe greater Agitations that it had in the production of the <hi>Aether,</hi> the ſeparation of the Water, and the arefaction of the Earth; which Proceſſes required a more ſevere and violent, active Inſtrument than was neceſſary, or indeed ſuitable to thoſe ſmaller Mutations which were after made; and probably if that piercing and great Lucid Nature had continued its Revolutions about the World, it would have been too ſtrong and violent either to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, or conſervation of thoſe Animals and Mankind that were now to be produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:64147:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>And ſo the diffuſed Light that circulated about the Univerſe, is now this fourth day diſtributed into theſe ſeveral Heavenly Bodies; 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now its uſe in that former ſtate and method of its exiſtence ceaſed. 2. It was now for the uſe of the Univerſe to have it diſtributed and ordered into thoſe ſeveral Veſſels, the Sun and Stars, that might with a gentler and better regulated Heat and Motion influence the World. 3. It was now more for the Beauty, Order, and Ornament of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, for the Glory and Honour of the Divine Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs to diſtribute this Light into ſeveral Veſſels, and according to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meaſures and proportions, and accommodated with ſeveral Motions; than to keep it in one vaſt and terrible Body circulating the Univerſe, which unrefracted might have been too penetrating and violent to the other parts of Nature.</p>
               <p>And this ſeems to be the Method of the Origination of the Heavenly Bodies: For though the firt Verſe tells us, that <hi>In the beginning God made the heavens and the earth,</hi> we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe that the Etherial Bodies and the Heavenly Luminaries were completed in the moment of Time, (whatever may be conjectured touching the <hi>Coelum Empyraeum;</hi>) for it is evident that Light the firſt-born of the Univerſe was not made till the firſt day; the <hi>Expanſum</hi> or <hi>Aether</hi> till the ſecond day; nor the Heavenly Hoſt, the Planetary and Fixed Stars till the fourth day.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here contend much touching the Syſtem of the Univerſe, whether the Earth be the Center thereof, or the Sun, whether it conſiſt of ſo many ſeveral Syſtems or <hi>Vortices,</hi> whether every Fixed Star hath its <hi>Vortex,</hi> and the Sun the Center of the Planetary <hi>Vortex;</hi> only thus much I ſhall ſay, 1. That this Diving <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> delivered to us by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems wholly to contradict the Suppoſition of Solid Orbs, and ſtrongly concludes that the Heavenly Bodies are moved <hi>in liquido Aethere.</hi> 2. It ſeems rather to countenance that Syſtem of the Univerſe that ſuppoſeth the Earth to be the common Center thereof, than <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the imaginary <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Copernicus, Galileus, Kepler,</hi> or <hi>Des Cartes.</hi> 3. That it utterly contradicts the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Ocellus,</hi> and the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> touching the Eternity of the World, or of the Heavens; and likewiſe the Fiction of <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> of the caſual Coalition of the Univerſe by the motion or interfering of Atoms.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I come to conſider of the Fifth Days Work, touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Fiſh and Fowls; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>And God ſaid, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven; and God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly after their kind and every winged fowl after its kind; and God ſaw that it was good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great Engin of the Heavenly Bodies being now conſtituted in that excellent ſtate and order for the uſe and conſervation of animal Life, God Almighty proceedeth in a moſt exquiſite order for the production of Animals; and becauſe the Waters were in themſelves a more ductile, and poſſibly a more fertil Body than the Earth; and alſo, becauſe <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the Fowls and Fiſhes are not of an equal perfection in their natures to the Brutes or Terreſtrial Animals; for theſe have certainly a more digeſted conſtitution, greater variety and curioſity in their bodily
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64147:157"/>
texture, and a higher Spirit and Soul, of nobler Inſtincts, and more capable of Diſcipline than the Fowl or Fiſhes. Therefore, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Vegetables anteceded the production of Animals; ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Animals aquatil and volatil preceded the production of terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Animals.</p>
               <p>What may elſe be ſaid in relation to this Days Work, I ſhall deliver in the Conſideration of the next firſt Part of the ſixth Days Work. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">4. The firſt Part of the ſixth Days Work comprized the production of Terreſtrial Animals; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>And God ſaid, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, and cattel, and every creeping thing and beaſt of the earth after his kind; and it was ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſons why Terreſtrial Animals had their production after the Fowls and Fiſhes, have been partly before intimated, and ſhall be here ſomewhat farther conſidered: And they are theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Although Almighty God be not bound or ſtraitned in his Operation to the ſequaciouſneſs of the Matter, yet it is not improper for us to ſuppoſe that he may purſue the Laws of his own making, where it conſiſts with his deſign and intention: The production of Vegetables by the Earth was indeed earlier; but then the energy of his Inſtrument the Light, perchance was ſtronger than after the diſtribution thereof into the Receptacles of the Heavenly Luminaries.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Ad plurimum,</hi> the nature of Terreſtrial Animals was a more refined nature than that of Fowls and Fiſhes, and therefore as the Matter might reaſonably expect a longer <hi>mora</hi> for its Concoction, ſo the Method of Creation, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> proceeded from the leſs elaborate Integrals of Mixt Bodies to the more elaborate, concluding with Man.</p>
               <p>And this preference of the Brutes above Fowls and Fiſhes, appears 1. In the manner of their natural procreation, the Brutes being <hi>ad plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimum vivipara,</hi> the others ariſing <hi>ad plurimum ex ovo.</hi> 2. In the great variety of their bodily compoſure; the texture of the Bodies of Brutes being far more curious, and fuller of variety than others. 3. <hi>Ad pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> the animal Faculties of the brutal Soul are far more perfect than thoſe of others, their Phantaſies and Memories refined, they have greater and more lively Images of Reaſon, and more capable of Diſcipline than either Fowls or Fiſhes.</p>
               <p>Now touching the production of Animals, whether Terreſtrial, Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, or Volatil, we may obſerve that they are in the ordinary courſe of Nature of two kinds: Some, which ariſe among us no otherwiſe, nor in any other manner than <hi>ex ſemine,</hi> which we uſually call perfect Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and ariſing by univocal generation; others there are that be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, ariſing ſpontaneouſly in the Earth, Air, and Water, as Worms, Flies, and ſome ſort of ſmall Fiſhes and watry Inſects.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, I ſhall now ſet down ſome Suppoſitions which ſeem to me truly to explicate the production of theſe Animals, which are theſe that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Although the predominat Matter in the conſtitution of Fowls and Fiſhes were Water, and in the conſtitution of Terreſtrial Animals were Earth; yet that Water nor that Earth were not ſimply ſuch, but were mixed and impregnated with the other Elementary Principles.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:64147:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. That all the <hi>Species</hi> of perfect Animals of all kinds were conſtituted in their ſeveral Sexes in the fifth and ſixth day of the Creation, but yet we muſt not think that all thoſe kinds which we now ſee were at firſt created, but only thoſe primitive and radical <hi>Species:</hi> How many ſorts of Animals do we now ſee, that yet poſſibly are not of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> but have accidental diverſifications, as we may obſerve in the ſeveral Shapes and Bodies of Dogs, Sheep, Pyes, Parots? which poſſibly at firſt were not ſo diverſified; ſome variation of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> happen by mixt Coition, ſome by diverſity of Climates, and other accidents.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the firſt Individuals in their diſtinction of Sexes were not produced according to thoſe Methods of Nature which they now hold, nor <hi>ex aliquo praeexiſtente ſemine,</hi> but by the immediate efficiency of Almighty God, out of the Matter prepared or deſigned for their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That they were made in the firſt inſtant of their Conſtitution in the full perfection and complement and ſtature of their individual and ſpecifical nature, and did not gradually increaſe according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure of animal augmentation at this day: and the reaſon is, becauſe thoſe gradual augmentations ariſe from the Seminal Principle which gradually expands it ſelf to the full growth; but here they aroſe not from any ſuch Seminal Principle, but the Hen was before the Egg.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There was no mean portion of Time between their Formation and Animation, but both were together, they were living Beings, and living Souls, and living Creatures as ſoon as they were formed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That conſequently the Formation of the Body of theſe Animals was not as now it is, by the Formative Power of the Soul, which muſt needs be gradual and ſucceſſive, as we ſee it is, and muſt be at this day in all natural Generations; but the Formation and Information of them was by virtue of the immediate <hi>Fiat,</hi> Determination, or Ordination of the Divine Will.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That in their Origination, the <hi>Species</hi> of theſe Animals were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined neither from the Matter, nor from the univerſal Cauſe, the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Heat; but by the Divine Intention and Ordination.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That by the ſame Divine Ordination and Intention, the Faculties ſpecifically belonging to every Individual were annexed and alligated to it, eſpecially the power, <hi>conficiendi ſemen prolificum, &amp; ſpeciei propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandae ex mutua utriuſque fexus conjunctione.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. That although by the Divine Power and Ordination all theſe perfect Animals did ariſe from the Earth, yet that Prolifick Power of propagating of them was never delegated or committed to the Earth, or any <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> other Caſual or Natural Cauſe; but only to the Seminal Nature, derived from their Individuals, and diſpoſed according to that Law of propagation of their kind, alligated as before to their ſpecifical and individual nature.</p>
               <p>And therefore it its perfectly impoſſible that any of theſe perfect Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals can be caſually, or naturally, or accidentally produced by any Preparation of Matter, or by any Influence of the Heavens, without the miraculous interpoſition of Almighty Power; becauſe the Earth, or thoſe Influences have not this power concredited to them, but their production is irreſiſtibly alligated to the <hi>Semen innatum</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:64147:158"/>
and conjunction of Sexes; the Earth can as naturally produce a Sun or a Star, as it can a Man, or a perfect Animal.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Whether thoſe imperfect or equivocal Animals were created or no, it is not altogether clear;, poſſibly ſome might be then produced, whoſe kinds were likewiſe producible ſpontaneouſly after; but it ſeems beyond contradiction that all were not.</p>
               <p n="11">11. As by virtue of that general Commiſſion or intrinſick Prolifick Power given to the Earth to produce ſpontaneous Herbs, as Graſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it doth naturally produce ſuch Herbs; ſo by virtue of that common Commiſſion given by Almighty God to the Earth and Water, and to that Spirit of Nature diffuſed in it, it doth naturally produce thoſe equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal inſect Animals which ariſe out of them.</p>
               <p>The ſame Law of the Creator that hath eternally excluded, or rather not committed to the Earth or Water the power of producing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Animals, hath given and committed to them by concurrence of that Vital Heat of the Sun and the common Spirit of Nature reſiding in them, a Productive Power of ſome equivocal inſect Animals in Matter fitly prepared.</p>
               <p>Touching therefore the Origination of Inſects I ſhall declare my thoughts as followeth; 1. That by virtue of the Divine <hi>Fiat</hi> the Earth at firſt did produce ſome Individuals of ſeveral kinds, which is imported under the words <hi>[Every creeping thing after its kind.]</hi> 2. That as I have before ſhewn, the greateſt part of the Inſects that are commonly produced, and ſeem to be ſpontaneous productions, are yet the univocal and ſeminal productions of Inſects of the ſame kind. 3. That yet it is a certain Truth, that ſome Inſects are, and have an Origination ſince the firſt Creation without any formal, univocal, ſeminal production; ſome out of Putrefaction, ſome out of Vegetables, ſome by very ſtrength and <hi>fracedo</hi> of the Earth and Waters quickned by the vigorous Heat of the Sun, which infuſeth into ſome Particles of Matter well prepared and digeſted a kind of Vital and Seminal Principle. Some have thought the very Sun and Earth are endued with a Vital, yea and with a kind of Senſitive Nature, and thereby enabled as it were to ſpin ſome prepared Matter into vital and ſentient <hi>Semina</hi> for thoſe inſect Animals: But we ſhall not need to trouble our ſelves with that incertain Speculation; we are ſure that the greateſt part of the Superficies of the Earth being daily and hourly impregnated with the corrupted and diſſolved Particles of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables and Animals, is at leaſt highly prepared for the ſpontaneous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Inſects and Vegetables of ſome kinds; and the benevolent Heat of the Sun hath a great influence thereupon to be the Inſtrument of Almighty God in theſe Productions: but it is his Sovereign Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution that committed to the Sun, the Earth, and the Waters and their Particles to produce ſome inſect Animals, and therefore they produce them, as Worms, Flies, Frogs; but he hath not concredited or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them that primitive Productive Power of perfect Animals, nay not of ſome noble Vegetables, <hi>fine praeexistente ſemine univoco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have conſidered the Hiſtory of the Worlds production, and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:64147:158"/>
the reaſonableneſs thereof. Now to the production of Terreſtrial Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, (for of the Creation of Man I ſhall ſpeak in the next Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.)</p>
               <p>It is true that there are two ſorts of natural Integrals whoſe Hiſtory is here omitted, and yet that omiſſion not without great reaſon; becauſe it ſeems their production was in a manner accidental and ſpontaneous, depending upon the various mixture of Materials formerly created, namely, Meteors and Minerals: the former conſummated in the Aery Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the appoſition and mixture of divers Excretions and Exhalations of the other parts of Nature; for we neither find, nor have any cauſe to look for Clouds, Comets, or Meteors in the compaſs of the firſt ſix Days. The latter ſeem to be Concretions and Digeſtions in the Bowels of the Earth, either altogether or for the moſt part begun and perfected after the Six Days Work, by the energy of the external, and Celeſtial, and internal, and connatural Fire and Heat.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> there have been that have ſuppoſed thoſe ſix Days to be of different length and extent from theſe Natural we are acquainted with, and that thoſe ſix Days, eſpecially the three firſt and three laſt thereof, differed exceedingly one from another, and that as the three laſt were of a far greater length and extenſion than our ordinary day or night; ſo the three former were exceedingly larger than the three latter of the ſix, and the computation of the whole by Six Days was only by a kind of Analogical Expreſſion to give Mankind a diſtinction of the Order of Production; and they ſuppoſe, 1. That the Divine Author by this diſtribution of Days did not intend any determinate portion of Time, much leſs days or times conformable to the length of our days, but certain Myſterious Numbers of Times; and therefore <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> in his firſt Book <hi>Allegoriarum Legis,</hi> tells us, <hi>Ruſticanae ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitatis eſt putare ſex diebus aut aliquo certo tempore mundum conditum, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plevit ſexto die opera, intelligere non debes de diebus aliquot, ſed de ſenario perfecto numero;</hi> and then takes a great deal of pains in illuſtrating the Myſtery of that Number. 2. Becauſe they would willingly introduce a kind of natural production of things according to a natural method, and gradual and ſucceſſive procedure, without the Suppoſition of an immediate concurrence or interpoſition of a Supernatural Influx or Cauſation; and therefore becauſe the ſeparation of Light, the firſt Days Work, naturally required a great time; as alſo the rarefaction and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Expanſum,</hi> the ſeparation of the Bodies of Earth and Water, and likewiſe the maturation and production of Vegetables out of it might require a longer time than ſome of the ſubſequent days Works, therefore the three firſt days were much longer than thoſe that follow: And again, ſince each of theſe great Works attributed to the three latter days were great Works, required great digeſtion, and ſeparation, and maturation of the Matter for the Heavenly Bodies; as alſo for the matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of living Animals, and their production: that even thoſe days might be conceived of a dimenſion or computation much larger than our Days, and poſſibly than our Months, or Years, or Ages. But theſe ſeem to be vain Conjectures, introduced meerly to exclude an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of a ſupernatural concurrence in the ſpeedy production and formation of things, and not warranted by the Holy Hiſtory, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64147:159"/>
it: For we have no reaſon to imagin that the ſixth day was of any other dimenſion than the ſeventh day, wherein God Almighty reſted; nor the fifth any longer than the ſixth; neither was it at all neceſſary the days ſhould be protracted to that length of time for two Reaſons: 1. Becauſe if we ſhould be ſo vain as to ſuppoſe a long proceſs, ſomewhat ſutable to what we now ſee in Nature, for the ſeparation, diſpoſition, and production of the Six Days Work; yet certainly there was a time intervening between the firſt Creation of the <hi>Materia Chaotica</hi> and the very inception of its complement into that Order that the Six Days Work exhibit to us; and although that time is not determinately ſet down, yet we may juſtly think it a long time: And again, in that long interval there was a powerful Agent ſubacting, diſpoſing, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing the <hi>Maſſa Chaotica,</hi> expreſſed by the Spirit of God moving upon the face of the Waters; whereby if it were neceſſary to have ſuch a preparatory proceſs towards the formation of the World antecedent to ſuch formation, it was not wanting here, and every Particle might thereby be ſo ripened and prepared that they might ſucceſſively give their apparences in thoſe portions of time wherein they are ranged by the Sacred Hiſtory. 2. Although in the Creation of the World and the Integrals thereof, Almighty God ſeemed ſomething to conform to the reaſonable Order of Cauſes ſutable or congruous to Effects, and did not put forth ſuch an immediate Activity in the Production of things as he did in their firſt Creation; this being done in an inſtant, that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, gradually, and yet <hi>per moram:</hi> Yet he was not bound to obſerve all the Ceremonies and Formalities of Natural Effects; neither did he, but by his own immediate Power gave a greater expedition to the firſt production of things, than that which he inſtituted for the ſtanding, fixed, and ordinary Method of future production and maturation of things to be generated after their firſt Origination: And as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible without the appoſition of a Supernatural Being and Cauſation, that the Matter of things ſhould be created out of nothing; or being ſo created, could without the Operation of a Supernatural Intelligent Being raiſe it ſelf up to the admirable Fabrick wherein it was finally perfected; ſo it is not reaſonable to deny to ſuch a Supreme, Supernatural, and Infinite Power an effectual maturation and compleating of things in thoſe portions and orders of times that beſt pleaſed him, and which his Wiſdom judged moſt agreeable to his Works and Ends. We find every Command of the Divine Will in the Creation of things anſwered by an immediate <hi>obſequium</hi> in the created Matter: If He ſay, <hi>Let there be Light; Let the Waters be gathered into one place; Let the Earth bring forth,</hi> &amp;c. the obſequious Matter preſently anſwered the Command with a <hi>Fuit ita,</hi> It was ſo. Not as if there were any Vocal Command given out to the Matter, but the ſecret Command and Determination of the Divine Will governed the Matter into an immediate conformable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, according to the <hi>Idea</hi> reſiding in the Divine Underſtanding; <hi>He ſpake and it was done, be commanded and it ſtood faſt.</hi> This beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Majeſty and Sovereignty of the Lord of all things.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. III.</hi> Concerning the Production and Formation of Man.</head>
               <p>HAving taken the former brief Survey of the Hiſtory of the Creation and Formation of the reſt of the Univerſe, I ſhall now proceed to what I principally intended in the diſcuſſion of that Hiſtory, namely, the Formation of Mankind, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>And God ſaid, Let us make Man in our own image, after our likeneſs, and let him have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the fowl of the air; and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; ſo God made man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them; and God bleſſed them, and ſaid unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and repleniſh the earth and ſubdue it, and have dominion over the fiſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the Creation of Man I ſhall obſerve theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Efficient of this firſt Production of Mankind was Almighty God, by the counſel and determination of his own Will: The Creation of Man is uſhered in with a Prologue unlike the Creation of other things, <hi>viz.</hi> by a kind of deliberation; not as if the Divine Wiſdom ſtood in need of counſel, advice, or concurrence of others, or of a <hi>mora delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva</hi> with himſelf; for known unto him were all his Works from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and by one ſimple, inſtantaneous, and indiviſible Act he foreſees what is fit to be done, and judgeth and determineth the ſame: but it is added as a Mark of Attention, and an Elogy of Prelation of this Work of the Creation of Mankind above the reſt of the viſible Creatures.</p>
               <p>Some of the Ancients have thought this Deliberation was real, and to have been made with the ſuperior World of Heavenly Intelligences; <hi>Nec (ſi fas ſit ita loqui) Deus quicquam fecerit, donec illud expenderit in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia ſuperiori:</hi> and it ſhould ſeem that the Opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> That Almighty God did adviſe with the <hi>Dii ex Diis,</hi> or the Intelligences or Angelick Natures, and uſed their aſſiſtance in the Creation of the Bodies of Men, though he himſelf formed their Souls; ſeems to be derived from the inſpection of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Hiſtory or Tradition of it, whereof he gave us his Senſe or Expoſition, that this <hi>[faciamus hominem]</hi> was by the concurrence or ſubordinate cooperation of Angels.</p>
               <p>Others, with far greater evidence, do think it was the Deliberation and Concluſion of the Three Perſons of the Holy Trinity.</p>
               <p>And ſome again interpret it to be only a Majeſtick Expreſſion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Almighty God, <hi>more regali,</hi> in the Plural Number; but touching theſe Conjectures I ſhall ſay no more but only this, That the firſt Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Production of Man was by the immediate Efficiency of Almighty God, not as if God Almighty uſed any Manual or Phyſical Plaſmation of a Man, as the Statuary makes his Statue, or as the Poets feign <hi>Prometheus</hi> moulded up his <hi>molle lutum</hi> into the Humane Shape, and animated him by diffuſion of Fire into him fetcht from Heaven; but by the Word, or Determination, or <hi>Fiat</hi> of his Omnipotent Will Man was formed and made.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The conſtituent Components out of which he was made were of

two kinds, 1. His Corporeal and Animal Nature was the ſame with the Matter of other Terreſtrial Animals, namely, the Elementary Matter, whereof Earth was the predominant. 2. His Spiritual Conſtituent as I may call it (though in union with the Senſible Power it be his conſtituent Form) was a Spiritual Subſtance, created and infuſed by Almighty God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>And God formed man of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, and man became a living ſoul.</hi> This Text gives us briefly, 1. The Matter of his Corporeal and Animal Conſtitution, the Duſt of the Ground, or as elſewhere, Red Clay. 2. The Nature or Kind of this other conſtituent part, the Breath of Life, a Vital, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Intellectual Subſtance or Nature. 3. The Union thereof to the Body, and Animal Nature breathed into him. 4. The reſult from that Union, Man became a living Soul, the whole Compoſition taking deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from his nobler eſſential Conſtituent. And this ſhort Hiſtory gives us the beſt account that can be of the true Nature of Man, namely, that he conſiſts of two eſſential conſtituent Parts, 1. His corporeal and animal nature, which though it were not only gradually but ſpecifically different from, and advanced above the Brutal Nature both in the Elegance, and Uſefulneſs, and Majeſty of his corporeal Fabrick, and in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and perfection of his animal Faculties, as in due time ſhall be ſhewn: Yet in his eſſential part he ſeemed to have a nature in ſome way common with them, both being material, and both their Faculties of the Animal Nature directed and ſubſervient to a Life of Senſe, and therefore cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and mortal in it ſelf. 2. His Intellectual Nature, which is ſpiritual, immortal, created immediately by Almighty God; that as in his Animal Nature<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I have before obſerved in the Order of Natural Beings with which we are acquainted, that there ſeems to be an admirable gradation in things, and the lower rank of Natural Exiſtences have ſome rough draughts, and ſtrokes, and ſhadows of thoſe perfections which are in the ſuperior: Minerals are a degree below Vegetables, yet they ſeem to have ſome ſhadow of the Vegetable Life in their growth, increaſe, and ſpecifick configurations. The loweſt degree of Life ſeems to be the Vegetables, yet in many of them and their Faculties, they ſeem to have ſome kind of rough ſtrokes or draughts of the Senſitive Nature, and the higheſt advances of the Vegetable Nature ſeem to come up to the confines and borders of the loweſt Form of Senſible Beings, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of ſomewhat of Senſe; which appears not only in the natural production of Inſects out of the fineſt parts and effluxes of moſt Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Natures, but alſo that ſome ſuch things there are that ſeem in their very nature of Plants to have a kind of lower connexion of the Animal Nature in them; as appears in the Senſitive Plant or <hi>Planta modesta,</hi> and thoſe Canes in the Kingdom of <hi>Angola,</hi> that are filled with a Worm growing from and continuous with it, called <hi>Trombe.</hi> Again, in the Animal Province there are divers ſenſible Inſects, both aquatil, volatil, and terreſtrial, that ſeem to be in the very next Rank of Nature to Vegetables: and again, ſome of the ſuperior ſort, eſpecially of Terreſtrial

Animals have <hi>quandam imaginem &amp; umbram rationis,</hi> and are advanceable by Induſtry and diſciplinable Acts to a great perfection, and ſeem to be the next rank of natures below the animal nature of Man, as Elephants, Horſes, and ſome others; but the nature of Man, though in the animal part of him he is the higheſt rank of viſible Animals; yet in his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual nature he ſeems to participate of the angelick nature, and is next below them in the ſpecifical exiſtence of Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.5. <hi>He was made a little lower than the Angels,</hi> and participates of the higheſt degree of Animals and the loweſt degree of Intelligences; participating of both natures, to keep as it were a continuity between the upper World and the lower, and to maintain a communion with them and between them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have here alſo the <hi>Idea</hi> or Model according to which the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature was framed, namely, after the Image and Similitude of God; wherein we are to take in Man conſtituted in his full and compleat nature, namely, in the union of his two Eſſential Parts, his Animal Nature, and his Intellectual. What this Image and Similitude of God was, or wherein it conſiſted, is variouſly diſputed, I ſhall firſt conſider what it was, and then what it is and was.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was not <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> any corporeal Similitude or Image; for the Divine Nature is incorporeal and inviſible, and therefore hath no Image or ſimilitude of that kind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was not any Image adequate to the Divine Perfection and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, as the Impreſſion in the Wax is the adequate Image or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Seal, and as large as it: for God's Perfections are infinite both in extention and intention, and no finite Being can be an adequate Image of an infinite Being or Perfection.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was not an Image that takes in all the reſemblance of the Parts of Divine Perfections or Excellences, as the little Image upon <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Coyn reſembled <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Effigies, or a new born Infant reſembles a full grown Man; for neither the Perfections nor the Being of God do <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire in uno aliquo genere univoco,</hi> with thoſe of Man: the Perfections of God are not repreſentable by any created Being in a true propriety of their nature, no more than in their degree of intention or perfection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Neither do I take it, that this Image or Similitude is only meant of that <hi>Idea</hi> of the Humane Nature in the Divine Underſtanding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to which Man was made; for though this be true, yet it is not all it ſays, nor all that is meant; becauſe it would give Man no greater preference than the very Vegetables that were made the Third Day, which were made according to the Ideal Image thereof in the Divine Intellect.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Neither do I think it was meant of the Second Perſon in the Trinity, who was the expreſs Image of the Father, the brightneſs of his Father and the expreſs Image of his Perſon; for although Chriſt aſſumed Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Fleſh, yet it was many Ages after: and in the Language of the Scripture and the Ancients, in the Creation Man was made like unto God, but in the Work of Redemption the Son of God became like unto Man: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Made in the likeneſs of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Neither do I think that the Image of God here meant was the greater World, the Univerſe, which though it be an excellent Image of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:64147:161"/>
the Divine Excellency, namely, of his Majeſty, Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, and ſets it out far more than any ſingle created Nature can; eſpecially if we take the Univerſe in its full comprehenſion both of the viſible and intellectual World. And though it be true that Man is a kind of Abridgment, a little Abſtract of that greater World in his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Nature, reſembling in his Soul the <hi>Mundus intelligibilis</hi> of created In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences, and in his Animal Nature bearing an admirable Analogy to the <hi>Mundus aſpectabilis;</hi> and ſo in both Natures conjoyned, being the little Image or Portraiture of the great and univerſal World: for though this is a Truth, yet it ſeems it was not the Truth intended.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Neither do I think it was intended of that reſemblance which in his Intellectual Part he bore to the good Angels, who of any particular created Natures beſt reſemble Almighty God; being pure, immaterial, intellectual, powerful, immortal, wiſe, and benevolent Beings: though this be alſo a Truth, that the Soul of Man ſeems to be the loweſt rank of Angelical Natures, yet it ſeems not the Truth that is here intended: for it is plain that the Image of God here meant, is ſpoken with reſpect to the intire Humane Nature, and of the whole <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> as appears in the reaſon after given by God, upon the interdiction of Murder, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. which had been an improper reaſon if applied to the Soul, which is immortal, and uncapable of death.</p>
               <p>But the meaning of this Image of God ſeems to be this: That as all Excellency comes from that moſt Excellent Author of all Beings; in whom all Excellencies are lodged formally, or eſſentially, or virtually; ſo this Excellent Author did theſe things in relation to the Humane Nature: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. He gave him a capacity greater than any other viſible, ſingle, created Being to receive the nobleſt Excellencies: 2. That he gave him as great a Capacity as poſſibly might be conſiſtent with ſuch a nature to receive Divine Excellencies: 3. That he filled that Capacity with all thoſe Excellencies that he was thus capable of, ſaving only that of a neceſſary immutability in the fruition of all thoſe Excellencies.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Excellencies with which the Humane Nature was filled, and which made him, as much as was poſſible for ſuch a created Being, to reſemble his Maker were theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the ſtructure of his Body and Animal Nature, moſt ſingular Majeſty, Beauty, Strength, and Uſefulneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his Soul a whole Conſtellation of Divine Excellencies, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Nature of it, Immortality and Spirituality; in the Faculties of it, a light and clear Intellect, a free and incoacted Will: in all which he highly reſembled the moſt intellectual and freeſt Being in the Habits of it, Knowledge in the Underſtanding, enabled by the nobleſt Object, God himſelf, and all other Objects of uſe and conveniency to him: in his Will, rectitude.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his whole <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> perfect fruition of all that ſutable good to his nature, wherein he conſiſted in Happineſs, Immortality, or a poſſible perſevering in Life without dying, Power and Authority over this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior World and all things therein, as God's Vicegerent upon Earth, in which reſpect Governours are ſaid to be Gods: a ſufficient power and ſtrength as well in the Frame of his Animal Life, as in the ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and advantage of his Underſtanding, to exerciſe that Dominion
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:64147:161"/>
and Sovereignty; and laſtly, a due Order, Subordination, and Regiment of all his Faculties.</p>
               <p>Of theſe Perfections ſome were accidental or adventitious to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature by the Benignity of Almighty God, and concredited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto upon condition of his Obedience to the Command of God; and upon the breach of that Condition were either utterly loſt, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolubility of the Union of the <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> by one Man's Diſobedience Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin: Others were abated, as the Excellency of his Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, the fruition of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, the Perfection of his Sovereignty over the Creatures, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs and Beauty, and much of the Vigour of his Body, the exquiſite Order and Subordination of his Faculties; but his Eſſentials, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of his Soul, the Faculties of Intellection and Will, and the Natural Beauty and Uſefulneſs of his Body remains, notwithſtanding that terrible Concuſſion; whereof ſomewhat more hereafter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We have the Method of this Production of Man; it was not by or from any meer Natural Cauſe, but by the immediate Command of the Divine Will, Wiſdom, and Power: it was not from any <hi>Semen</hi> naturally, accidentally, or intentionally formed, and ſo by a gradual maturation and growth <hi>ex uteris terreſtribus,</hi> or as the <hi>foetus humanus</hi> is perfected at this day: For it was not poſſible that any ſuch Seminal Principle ſhould be formed caſually, or by any meer Natural Cauſe, as hath been already ſhewn: And although the Divine Power could have perfected all, as well Man as the other Animals, by firſt forming ſuch a <hi>Semen,</hi> and giving it either a gradual or ſpeedy production, as Inſects are at this day produced; yet 1. It was utterly ſuperfluous to have uſed ſuch a <hi>proceſſus formativus ex ſemine,</hi> becauſe it required no leſs than an Almighty Power to have moulded and faſhioned, or actuated ſuch a <hi>Semen</hi> as to have produced Man by an immediate Supernatural Formation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction: and therefore ſince the ſame Power was requiſite in both, it is not at all neceſſary nor reaſonable to ſuppoſe ſo long a proceſs as firſt to form a <hi>Semen,</hi> and by a Seminal Proceſs to have perfected the Humane Nature, and the Holy Hiſtory expreſly imports the contrary. 2. If we ſuppoſe a <hi>Semen</hi> prepared by the Divine Power, that Production that muſt ariſe thereupon muſt either be immediate and ſudden, if not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inſtantaneous; or it muſt be gradual, and paſs through all theſe ſpaces of Time, gradual Formation, and acceſſion of Growth and Increaſe, as we ſee <hi>in embryone &amp; foetu nuper nato:</hi> We cannot ſuppoſe the former but we muſt ſuppoſe it to be otherwiſe than natural, and call in the Divine Power to effect it, as much as in an inſtantaneous formation, <hi>ſine praecedente ſemine:</hi> And we cannot ſuppoſe the latter, becauſe it is expreſly contrary to the deſcription of the Humane Production, for it was done within the compaſs of the Sixth Day; and the formation and perfecting of the Humane Nature was immediately finiſhed after the Omnipotent Command and Determination of the Will of God, it was no ſooner ſaid <hi>[faciamus hominem, &amp;c.]</hi> but it was done.</p>
               <p>It is true, in that ordinary Law which Almighty God hath inſtituted in Nature already eſtabliſhed by him, there are regular, and ſucceſſive, and gradual procedures, and it is convenient it ſhould be ſo: and it is true alſo, in this ſhort period of the Six Days Work, within which the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64147:162"/>
Univerſe was finiſhed, Almighty God obſerved a certain convenient Order, making that to precede which was fitteſt and moſt uſeful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede in order to the production of things; but as to the ſpeed and diſpatch of Productions, the Almighty God uſed the Majeſty that became the Excellency of his Greatneſs, and obſequious Matter preſently yielded to the Power of his Command, <hi>Fiat, &amp; factum eſt;</hi> Pſal. 33.9. <hi>He ſaid and it was done, he commanded and it stood faſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore although now in ſettled Nature, and according to the ſtanding Laws of the Divine Wiſdom Man is firſt conceived <hi>ex ſemine,</hi> then lodgeth 10 Months <hi>in utero muliebri,</hi> wherein during that time he is gradually formed and perfected; and then after his Birth gradually increaſeth, paſſeth through the impotency of Infancy, the weakneſſes of Childhood, and the follies of Youth before he comes to a ripe and full age, yet it was not ſo here; in the ſame moment the Body is formed in its full and perfect nature, and the Animal Soul and Faculties together with it and the Rational Soul infuſed in the ſame moment, without any priority of Time, but only of Order and Nature: So that Man was at the very ſame moment a perfect Organical Body, with all his Nerves, Veins, <hi>Viſcera,</hi> Bones, and Parts conformed, a Vital and Senſitive Nature joyned with it, and a Rational Soul infuſed, without firſt living the Life of a Plant, then of an Animal, then of a Man; the whole Scene was performed in one moment, and ſo it became both the Greatneſs of the Divine Majeſty and Power; and ſo it was neceſſary to be in the firſt production of Man, although in the ſucceeding procedure of natural Generations it muſt be and was otherwiſe, becauſe the ſupreme Wiſdom and Will judged it ſo.</p>
               <p>And although to any Man that will duly conſider almoſt any thing, there muſt of neceſſity be another Rule or Law for the firſt production of things, than there is or may be in the ordinary regiment and governing of Generations when Nature is once eſtabliſhed; yet the want of this Conſideration hath bred all thoſe vain Errors of thoſe Philoſophers that aſſerted the Eternity of the World; and of thoſe others, who being not ſatisfied with that <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> but driven by a kind of neceſſity of Reaſon to acknowledge an Origination of Mankind, yet could not deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from fancying that Humane Productions muſt needs be as like thoſe they now know, as they could well frame them: And therefore according to theſe Men the Earth muſt be conceited to be <hi>Mater,</hi> and the Sun <hi>vice Patris,</hi> and the Earth muſt have her <hi>Uteri</hi> and <hi>Succus nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and the Increaſe of Mankind muſt be by ſome ſuch gradual proceſs as we ſee in natural productions or <hi>ſponte nata;</hi> and they cannot eaſily bring their Minds to believe the inſtantaneous production of Man by the immediate Power of God, becauſe it hath a gradual proceſs in ordinary natural Generations: and yet the ſame Men can give themſelves leave to imagin, <hi>Hominem oriri poſſe ſicut blitum;</hi> though never Experience of former Ages ſince the exiſtence of Men upon the Earth give us any Example of it, bating only the Fictions of ſome Poets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maimonides, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. hath obſerved this Miſtake, and ſingularly confutes it, by evincing, That if Men go by this Rule of Judgment the nature of things in their Original, as they find them in their Conſtitution, being conſtituted, they will disbelieve the moſt certain Truths. <hi>Neque

               <p>It is true, Men muſt be wary and conſiderate before they conclude againſt the Frame and Order of things as they appear in Nature, becauſe otherwiſe Men may take liberty to conjecture any thing, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly unbecoming a Philoſopher, eſpecially who pretends to govern himſelf by the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, and it is that which we have before condemned. But on the other ſide, to ſuppoſe that impoſſible in the Origination of things which we find not in things already ſetled, is too haſty and raſh a Concluſion; eſpecially when we are driven to confeſs another kind of Origination of Mankind than now is, and do not find any ſo probable and ſo free from abſurd Conſequences, ſo ancient, ſo convincingly delivered, as that by the Divine Hiſtorian <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is ſo much the rather credible, becauſe it is impoſſible to conceive that Man could have his firſt Origination but from an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, moſt wiſe and powerful Efficient, unleſs a Man ſhall offer violence to his own Reaſon; and certainly to ſuch an Efficient ſuch a Production is not only poſſible, but ſutable to be ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We have here preſcribed and determined the Law and Means of the natural production of the Individuals of Mankind in their future production, according to that Method and Mode which hath in all Ages ever ſince by the courſe of Nature been obſerved, namely, by Propagation by mutual Conjunction of their Sexes, though this could not be the Method of their firſt production.</p>
               <p>And this Prolifick Power of production of Mankind by ſucceſſive natural generation, was by the Virtue and Efficacy of the Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and Benediction given to Mankind in his firſt Creation, and by
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:64147:163"/>
virtue thereof that Power and Faculty is continued in them, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the ſucceeding Individuals to this day; and accordingly, <hi>Virtute divinae ordinationis &amp; inſtitutionis uterque ſexus appetitum illum procreandi innatum habent, membra &amp; vaſa huic facultati ſubſervientia hucuſque obtinent, &amp; diverſitate ſexuum eidem officio neceſſariâ gaudent, quod non vel cafuſ, vel stupida &amp; coeca natura obtinere potuerunt, ſine ordinatione, appropriatione, inſtitutione ſummi &amp; ſapientiſſimi numinis, ejúſque volitionis &amp; determination<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis:</hi> And as this Law of future Generations was thus given to Mankind, and <hi>quaſi alligata</hi> to them, ſo it is excluſive of any other either caſual or natural way of Generation, except it be by Miracle; and therefore we muſt now ſuppoſe a poſſibility of an utter abrogation of this natural Law, if we ſhould ſuppoſe any other kind of natural production of Mankind ſhould after this firſt production of the Humane Nature be poſſible: We may with as fair a Suppoſition imagin that a Man ſhould be produced by the natural conjunction of Sheep or of Lions, or a Star be produced <hi>ex putri materia terreſtri,</hi> as to ſuppoſe a Man to be produced accidentally, caſually, or naturally in any other Method than this Divine Law of Nature fixed in the Humane Nature by the Divine Inſtitution hath determined, unleſs as great a ſupernatural Miracle ſhould happen by the Divine immediate Power, as did in the Conception of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. As ſubſervient and neceſſary to this Law of future Generation, we have here the diſtinction of Sexes, <hi>[Male and female created he them.]</hi> This diſtinction and conjunction of Sexes in order to the propagation of Mankind, was part of that Law and Order that the Wiſe God inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for this end.</p>
               <p>And certainly there needs not any clearer Argument that the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Mankind was not a Work of Chance or blind neceſſary Nature, but a Work of a moſt Wiſe, Intelligent, Powerful Being, that adapted the diſcrimination of Sexes to the propagation of Mankind; either Sex without the other being in Nature utterly unprofitable and unuſeful to that end, without which the ſucceſſion of Mankind muſt have been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the firſt Individual.</p>
               <p>And it is no leſs evidence of the continual active Providence of that Great and Wiſe God, that the ſucceſſion of both Sexes is continued in that equal proportion, as that there is no grand diſparity in the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Individuals of either Sex.</p>
               <p>This diverſity of Sexes was not in the ſame Individual, as if <hi>Adam</hi> had been <hi>Androgyna,</hi> or one double Perſon conjoyned or continued, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of both Sexes (till they were after divided and ſevered) as <hi>Plato in Sympoſio,</hi> and many of the ancient and modern <hi>Jews</hi> have thought; but the firſt Creation of <hi>Adam in virili ſexu</hi> being perfected, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Eve ex latere Adami</hi> was the very ſame Day of his Creation miraculouſly performed by Almighty God; for the Words <hi>[Male and female created he them]</hi> referr to the whole entire complement of the Creation of Man, which was not till the Formation of <hi>Eve.</hi> There may be ſomething myſterious in this buſineſs of the Manner of <hi>Eves</hi> Formation which may be hard to unriddle.</p>
               <p>It is enough, that God Almighty before the end of the Sixth Day formed both Sexes of Mankind in order to the common help of each
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64147:163"/>
other, and the propagation of the future Generations of Mankind: the Hiſtory therefore of the Formation of <hi>Eve,</hi> though mentioned in the ſecond Chapter, and after the Benediction of the Seventh Day, muſt neceſſarily be referred to the Sixth Day, wherein it is expreſly affirmed that both Sexes in diſtinct Perſons were then created, <hi>[Male and female created he them;]</hi> and ſuch tranſpoſitions are not unuſual, neither in the Holy Hiſtory nor in other Hiſtories.</p>
               <p>The firſt Chapter gives the brief and orderly Relation of the whole <hi>Series</hi> of Times, and Things done in them; and the ſecond Chapter is only a fuller and more explicit Declaration of ſome things that are briefly and compendiouſly delivered in the firſt Chapter, as appears not only by the Relation of the Formation of <hi>Eve,</hi> but divers other paſſages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to what was tranſacted in the firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Formation of Man was the laſt Work of the Creation, the laſt Work of the laſt Day: and the Reaſons of this Order ſeem to be theſe; 1. Becauſe in the Method of the Creation of Sublunary Natures Almighty God proceeded from the leſs to the more perfect and curious Parts of the viſible Creation: as firſt he made Vegetables, then Fiſhes and Birds, then Brutes, and Man in the laſt place, as the moſt perfect, and containing not only the Faculties of Vegetables and Animals, and that in a more perfect nature, but alſo a ſuperadded, intellectual, ſpiritual Soul. So he was the nobleſt part of the Creation, at leaſt of this lower World. 2. Becauſe Mankind ſhould be furniſhed to his hand with all things convenient and uſeful to his exiſtence and operation, as the Graſs was provided before the Brutes were created, ſo before the Creation of Mankind Fruits of the Earth were provided for his food and delight, a Paradiſe for his entertainment and employment of his Senſes and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, Idleneſs being not indulged even in Paradiſe; and the goodly Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of the viſible World both Celeſtial and Sublunary, to raiſe his Admiration, Contemplation, and Delight. 3. Becauſe God Almighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him a liberal Patrimony, which he would furniſh and compleat in all its numbers before Man was created, and as ſoon as he had created him, gave him this inferior World, as his Uſufructuary and Steward at leaſt; but yet withall gave him a ſubordinate dominion of that whereof he made him his Steward: and this great Benefactor prepared this Gift of this inferior Terreſtrial World to be ready for his Creature Man's reception as ſoon as he had a Being, and accordingly gave it him with all its Furniture. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28, 29.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That Man was by Almighty God in his firſt Creation in a ſtate of perfect Felicity and Immortality, but under a condition of Obedience to the Divine Will, Command, and Law; that he had implanted in his Mind and Conſcience certain Principles of Moral Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs, which are the Original of thoſe common Notions of Good and Evil, as ſo many ſecret Byaſſes and Inclinations to the obſervance of the Good and avoidance of the Evil. And as even the inferior Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals have implanted in them ſecret Inſtincts and Tendences for the preſervation and advance of their ſenſible, individual, and ſpecifical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſo theſe implanted Notions and Moral Inclinations in the Mind of Man, were therein lodged to guide and lead him in a conformity to his excellent Conſtitution, and for the attainment of an intellectual

and eternal Good; and theſe, though the vigour and brightneſs of them were much abated by his Fall, yet were tranſmitted with his nature to his Deſcendents.</p>
               <p>And this is the Original of thoſe common Notions which yet remain in the Humane Nature, though refracted and abated by the Fall of Man; this is that common Light and Law of Nature which to this day in ſome meaſure prevails in the generality of Mankind, to the Acknowledgment, Adoration, and Reverence of a Deity and Moral Righteouſneſs; this is that Law of Nature mentioned by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. written in the Hearts of Men, wherby they do by Nature the things contained in the Law: But of this I ſhall write ſomewhat fuller in the enſuing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Beſides this Moral inſcribed Law, God Almighty for the tryal of Man's Obedience, gave him a poſitive Law prohibiting the eating of the forbidden Fruit, under pain of temporal and eternal Death and Curſe; and Man was left in the hands of his own liberty, to obey or diſobey it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That Man being left to the free liberty of his own Will, though furniſhed with ſufficient abilities to have obeyed Almighty God, yet by the temptation of Satan, his own ſenſual appetite, and ambitious affectation, violated his Maker's Law, and broke that Condition upon which much of his Perfection and Happineſs was conferred upon him; and although he retained his Eſſentials, namely, his Eſſential Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, this Spirituality and Immortality of his Soul, his Faculties of Underſtanding and Will, he thereby incurred theſe unhappy depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>

               <p n="2">2. A very great abatement of that temporal Felicity he had in this Life, and obnoxious to the everlaſting ſeparation from God, with the Death of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An abatement and diminution of thoſe Habits of Knowledge and Rectitude of Soul, and a great weakning and decay of the vigour and activity of connatural implanted Notions or Inclinations.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. IV.</hi> The Reaſonableneſs of this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Origination of the World, and particularly of the Humane Nature, and the great Advantages it hath above all other <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> touching the ſame.</head>
               <p>THat the World had a beginning of its Being, at leaſt in that order and conſiſtence that it now holds, I have ſhewed in the beginning of this Book; Again, if there could be any imaginable doubt or queſtion, whether the great Integrals of the World were eternal, and without beginning, yet I have ſhewed, that Mankind, or the ſucceſſive Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations thereof, <hi>ex ante genitis,</hi> is in Nature and Reaſon impoſſible, and in Fact and Experience apparently improbable, and therefore that there were ſome common Parents of Mankind, who had their beginning of exiſtence, and that in ſome other way than they are now produced.</p>
               <p>All that have ſuppoſed an Origination of Mankind <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> have admitted ſomething either of Matter analogous to it, out of which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath had ſuch his Origination (which we alſo admit as to all his Conſtituents at leaſt, but his Soul) and therefore the great Debate hath been touching the Efficient, or that Being, or Nature, (or whatever we ſhall call it) that firſt compounded, formed, and conſtituted the firſt Parents of Mankind in that eſſential and individual ſtate, conſonant to that ſpecification of Humane Nature which we daily now ſee.</p>
               <p>Every thing that hath a beginning of Being, muſt either have it from it ſelf, or from ſome other active, efficient, and conſtituent Power or Nature, antecedent to it in time, or at leaſt in Nature, or both.</p>
               <p>To ſuppoſe that the Humane Nature at firſt conſtituted it ſelf, were to ſuppoſe it to have a propriety of exiſtence to it ſelf, which were a palpable abſurdity and contradiction, for then it ſhould be before it was. Therefore it is neceſſary, that the firſt Origination of Humane Nature ſhould be from ſome other beginning or cauſe antecedent to it, beſides the Matter out of which it was conſtituted.</p>
               <p>And whatſoever the Being or Cauſe originating Humane Nature was, it muſt be in nature of an Efficient, namely, ſomething that did actively put together the conſtituent parts thereof, and formed it into that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence and exiſtence whereby he became Man.</p>
               <p>We cannot by any means ſuppoſe any ſuch Efficient or Being, or thing that did <hi>ſubire rationem efficientis,</hi> but one of theſe four: 1. An uncertain caſual conflux of Particles of Matter that caſually compounded a <hi>Semen humanae naturae,</hi> and ſo though the immediate <hi>Semen,</hi> thus conſtituted, may obtain the Name or Notion of the immediate Efficient, yet the true Efficient of that <hi>Semen</hi> (if we may be allowed to call it by that name) was Chance or Fortune. 2. An implanted blind determinate ſomething, which we call Nature, which by a fatal and neceſſary connexion of ſurd and irrational Cauſes and Effects produced the firſt Parents of Mankind, as the like Nature by the like neceſſity produceth yearly Worms and Flies, and other Inſects that have not their exiſtence by univocal Seed: Both theſe two Suppoſitions have been before examined and rejected, as <hi>impares huic
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64147:165"/>
negotio.</hi> 3. The illapſe of ſome pre-exiſtent or animating formative Principle, which we may well call the Soul or <hi>Anima,</hi> that as in the Generation of Mankind by ordinary procreation we ſee the formative power is ſome refined active Spirit or Soul <hi>in ſemine deliteſcens,</hi> that faſhions the Matter, and actuates it with vital ſenſible Faculties and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; ſo the illapſe of ſome ſuch active ſubſtance or powerful Being, illapſing into Matter and united to it, might form it into that conſtitution which it enjoyed. 4. and Laſtly, Or ſome ſuperior, powerful, wiſe, and intellectual Being, that did form, faſhion, actuate, and conſtitute the firſt Parents of Mankind.</p>
               <p>The two former being as before laid aſide, I ſhall uſe a few words touching the third Suppoſition, of which little hath been before ſaid, and ſo pals to the fourth and laſt and true Suppoſition of the Firſt Efficient of Humane Nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore touching the third Suppoſition, concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Mankind by virtue of ſuch Illapſe of Forms, we may ſuppoſe it to be intended one of theſe two ways: 1. Either that with <hi>Origen</hi> we ſhould imagin a <hi>Mundus animarum</hi> that had real and individual Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtences: Or 2. that there were ſome common Element of animate Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, not divided into individual Exiſtences, but one common rational and vital Nature, whoſe Particles illapſing into Matter might produce ſuch firſt Exiſtences of Mankind, and ſo though in their union to Matter they do <hi>ſubire rationem formae,</hi> yet they do likewiſe <hi>ſubire rationem efficientis,</hi> as to the formation of Mankind, as the vital Principle in the Egg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not only the form of the Chick, but alſo in the firſt formation thereof is the diſpoſer of its Organs and exerciſe of its Faculties, and ſo doth <hi>ſubire rationem efficients immediati</hi> in the formation of the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to both theſe in general, I ſay, 1. That they are precarious Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, without any juſt reaſon to evidence, either that there were ſuch pre-exiſting individual Souls, or a common reaſonable Spirit. Again, 2. The Suppoſition that theſe ſhould be the immediate Efficients of the Humane Nature, is likewiſe precarious and inevident. 3. Even they that ſuppoſe either ſuch an individual or common pre-exiſting Nature, muſt be forced to ſuppoſe them eternal independent Beings, and this will have as many difficulties in it as the Eternity of Mankind; or elſe if they be ſuppoſed created Beings, yet ſtill there will be a neceſſary recourſe unto an infinite uncreated eternal Being that muſt create them. And 4. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Framers of theſe Suppoſitions do with much more difficulty and laboriouſneſs form intermediate Principles of the Origination of Mankind, which with leſs difficulty and greater congruity may be reſolved into the immediate Efficiency of Almighty God, according to the Divine Hiſtory. 5. And beſides all this, if Men will needs ſuppoſe a Formation of Man by the illapſing of Souls into prepared Matter, becauſe they ſee this is the Method of Formation in the ordinary courſe of Generation now, they muſt alſo ſuppoſe the progreſs of the Formation and Maturation of the Humane Nature: This way muſt be gradual and ſucceſſive, which will be attended with all thoſe difficulties which are before obſerved in the Suppoſition of caſual or natural production of Man in his firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But in particular to thoſe ſeveral Suppoſitions, and Firſt, touching the firſt of theſe: The Opinion of the pre-exiſtence of Souls
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64147:165"/>
of Men, and their deſcent into Bodies, though it hath been countenanced by <hi>Plato</hi> and ſome that follow him, hath chiefly as it ſeems been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſome of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſome few <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> both recognizing the true God, the Immortality of the Soul, and future Reſurrection: For the ancient Jewiſh Opinion <hi>vide wiſdom</hi> 8.19, 20. <hi>[For I was a witty Child, and had a good ſpirit, rather being good I came into a Body undefiled.]</hi> Among Chriſtians, <hi>Origen</hi> much aſſerted this Opinion. But whatever may be ſaid touching the truth or falſhood of the Opinion it ſelf, it can no way ſupport the primitive Origination of Mankind by the illapſing of ſuch Souls into elementary Matter.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It exceeds the power and activity of ſuch imagined, pre-exiſtent Souls, to form and animate Matter into the conſiſtence of a Man without the intervention either of the immediate power of God, or at leaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that inſtituted Method fixed by God in the Generation of Mankind <hi>ex ſemine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it doth ſo exceed the activity of Souls thus to do, appears in this, that although there is according to that Suppoſition of a <hi>Mundus animarum</hi> a ſufficient ſtock of exiſting Souls, and if there were not, yet thoſe that once informed humane Bodies ſurvived after the <hi>diſſolutio com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiti,</hi> and yet we never heard ſince the firſt formation of Man that any ſuch new formation hath been made, nor any illapſe of any ſuch Soul into any other <hi>Foetus,</hi> but what hath been formed according to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Law of the ſucceſſive production of Mankind <hi>ex mixtione ſeminis utriuſque ſexus.</hi> Nay the more conſiderate <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that held the Tranſmigration of Souls, never ſuppoſed any tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into any ſpontaneous production of Man or Animal, but only into ſuch as proceeded <hi>ex univoca generatione;</hi> and what hath never been done, yea never ſuppoſed to have been done, we have no reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe poſſible to be done by any natural and finite Efficient, for ſuch theſe Souls muſt be whether they pre-exiſted or not.</p>
               <p>And therefore though in the Reſurrection the ſeparated Soul is ſuppoſed to reaſſume his own Body again, yet this ſeems not to be by any natural power reſiding in the Soul to form the Body and reunite it ſelf to it, but muſt be attributed to that Almighty Power of the Glorious God, and to the working of His Mighty Power, whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf; and by the very ſelf-ſame exceſs of power, whereby he firſt created Man upon the Earth, ſhall he form, raiſe, and reunite the Humane Nature in the Reſurrection, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. Chriſt the Son of and raiſed himſelf; but in the Reſurrection the Dead ſhall be raiſed by the Power and Command of the Glorious God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is not ſuppoſed by thoſe, that the Souls of perfect Brutes had any exiſtence antecedent to their firſt production; for their Souls are not of a ſelf-ſubſiſting nature, they cannot exiſt out of them, but begin with them, and dye with them; ſo theſe in their firſt production could not ariſe by any ſuch <hi>illapſus animarum</hi> into elementary Matter, but we muſt attribute their primitive Formation or Creation to the Command of the Divine Will; and ſo if we give them any Origination, we ſhall upon this Suppoſition give them a nobler Origination, and by a more immediate interpoſition of the Divine Power and Will, than to that of Man, which ſeems unreaſonable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:64147:166"/>As to the Second, It is true the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> attributed an Univerſal Soul to the Univerſe, the <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> which though they ſometimes ſuppoſe it a created Intelligent Nature, yet in other places we ſhall find them attributing ſo great power and energy to it, that it ſeems they made it to be no other than God himſelf. But when they held their Suppoſition of an <hi>Anima mundi</hi> as a created Exiſtence ſubordinate to Almighty God, although they attribute many of the great Appearances of Nature, both in their production and government to this Univerſal Spirit, yet they dare not aſſert unto it the Efficiency of the firſt Original of Humane Nature by it; and if they ſhould, yet this their Suppoſition would have this flaw in it, that they take greater pains, and run the hazard of more difficulties, by ſuppoſing the Origination of Man from this <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> than if they ſhould with us ſuppoſe the immediate Origination by the Divine Power; neither do they gain any thing by it. But this I may poſſibly reſume again hereafter.</p>
               <p>But the Suppoſition whereof we took notice before is this, That there is a threefold created Univerſal Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Natura mentalis,</hi> common to Men and Angels; a <hi>Natura ſenſitiva,</hi> common to Animals; and a <hi>Natura ignea,</hi> which is the common Principle of Vegetation.</p>
               <p>And therefore as the <hi>communis natura ignea</hi> is diſperſed through the Univerſe, and by participation thereof to particles of Matter gives an exiſtence to the Vegetables of ſeveral natures, ſo the communication of the <hi>communis natura ſenſitiva</hi> might at firſt give an original to perfect Senſitives, as perchance it now doth to <hi>inſecta ſponte naſcentia;</hi> ſo the participation of the <hi>Natura mentalis</hi> to ſome portions of elementary Matter may alſo give the origination of the firſt Men and Women in the World.</p>
               <p>Two things I ſhould ſay to this:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Although it be true, that the abſtraction of the Underſtanding, ranging the Souls of living things under theſe Diſtinctions and generical Notions, hath given us the Notion of one common <hi>Mentalis natura,</hi> and one common <hi>Senſitiva natura,</hi> and one common <hi>Ignea natura;</hi> yet it will be hard to prove, that there are any ſuch real common Natures really exiſting, but in the Individuals thereof. We have the common Notion of <hi>Natura animalis,</hi> and yet never any Man could make out, that there was any <hi>Animalis natura</hi> but what exiſted in the Individuals, or that here ever was or can be really exiſting any Animal with it, not determined in ſome more contracted exiſtence than an Animal.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I muſt needs confeſs there is a fair probability of Reaſon offered by many Learned Men of this triplicity of exiſting common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and it carries a great analogy with many other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Nature, and therefore I dare not generally deny it, though the explication of the manner of their Exiſtences, their particular Natures and Uſes, be difficult. But if it be admitted (as poſſibly it may be) that there is ſome common Element of Mental Nature, another common Element of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Nature, and another common Element of <hi>Ignea Natura,</hi> and that the ſeveral Ranks of Beings, Rational, Senſitive and Vegetable, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of theſe reſpective Natures, as their common Store or Element from whence they are derived, and therefore for inſtance the Rational Soul in Man were a participation of that common Element or Stock of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:64147:166"/>
the <hi>Mentalis natura;</hi> yet ſtill we muſt go higher for the Origination of Mankind, for this would be no other than as it were the <hi>Materia prima</hi> or <hi>communis</hi> of the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either this <hi>Natura mentalis</hi> is indiviſible, and communicated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely without any diſtribution of ſeveral divided parts of it to all Men, as the common Heat of the Sun is communicated to a thouſand Men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then all Men will have one common Soul, and there will be no individuation nor principle of individuation between Mankind, for the ſame univerſal indiviſible Soul reaſons and wills in every Man, which would be unintelligible and abſurd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or to uphold Individuation in the Perſons and Souls of Men, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Natura mentalis</hi> muſt be either truly ſeveral divided Souls, with <hi>Origen</hi>'s <hi>Mundus animarum;</hi> or elſe, though this common Nature be actually one at firſt, yet it is diviſible, and potentially many: and ſo the ſeveral Souls of ſeveral Men muſt be ſo many ſeveral Particles or <hi>Ramenta</hi> of this <hi>Univerſalis natura;</hi> and either this portion thereof muſt be by the ſuperior Activity of Almighty God, or elſe it muſt have a kind of natural diviſion of it ſelf, according to the diviſion of Matter qualified and organized to receive it: If the former, ſtill there is <hi>dignus vindice nodus;</hi> for God Almighty muſt be called in to diſtribute and participate the portions of this Mental Nature: if the latter, then what ſhall become of the Individuation of the Soul after Death? It will return back, and be drowned as it were in the <hi>Natura mentalis,</hi> or be annihilated; and if it keeps its Individuation, it muſt be by the Power and Interpoſition of Almighty God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But be it what it will, ſuppoſe it be the common Matter as it were of the Souls of Men, and therefore now in the ordinary courſe of Propagation, by a kind of ſetled Law in Nature may communicate it ſelf or any portion of it ſelf, to the natural productions of Mankind; yet where do we find, that either it ever did, or can of its ſelf form a Body out of Elementary Nature, and unite it ſelf unto it? Or how could that be done without the ordinary method of Generation, to diſpoſe and organize the Recipient or organized Body, or the interpoſition of a ſuperior Intelligent Nature, that muſt form and unite it; and if it ever did, or could do the ſame by its own immediate Activity, why do we not ſee the ſame thing done daily without the courſe of ordinary Generation <hi>ex Semine,</hi> ſince this <hi>commune Elementum mentale</hi> ſtill is ſuppoſed to exiſt, and of the ſame efficacy as ever it was?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is obſervable, that in all theſe kinds of Suppoſitions either of one <hi>Mundus animarum individualium</hi> with <hi>Origen,</hi> or of a common <hi>Elementum mentale,</hi> whether diviſible or indiviſible, nothing can be done without taking in the Power of an Omnipotent God, either in the firſt Creation of theſe Souls or Elements, or in the direction, ordering and governing of their illapſes into Matter, or of the preparing and organizing of Matter in the firſt Origination of Men, or in the ſeparating or individuating of theſe Elements, or in the uniting of them to Matter, or in giving the Law, and Rule, and Inſtitution of their future Regiment, or indeed in all of theſe: And ſo Men have needleſly, and without ſufficient evidence multiplied <hi>Entia,</hi> and yet ſuch as are not effectual to the ſolution of the <hi>Phaenomena; niſi Deus interſit;</hi> and all this plainly expedited with the ſame eaſe, and leſs perplexity and multiplicity, by the immediate Command of the Divine Will and Power in the firſt production of Things, according to the plain, explicable, and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:64147:167"/>
intelligible Syſtem given us by God by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> namely, an immediate Formation of Man, an immediate Creation of an Immortal Intellectual Soul, and an immediate Union of both Parts of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum</hi> by Almighty God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Indeed if it be ſuppoſed that one common Mental Nature may be ſpecifically appropriate to the Humane Nature, (not taking in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical) the difficulty of the ſpecification of Humane Nature by that common Mental Principle may be removed, becauſe the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is but one <hi>Species;</hi> yet the Suppoſition of one common Senſitive or Vegetable Nature, as the common Conſtituent of Animals and Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, leaves us under this perplexity and difficulty, namely, How from that common Senſitive Nature there ariſeth diverſity of <hi>Species</hi> of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals and Vegetables; or ſince the Principles are but of one kind, how comes the <hi>Species</hi> to be ſeveral: And on the other ſide, if the variety of <hi>Species</hi> ariſe from the different modification or qualification of the Matter, How comes it to paſs that there is any fixedneſs and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Species</hi> of Animals or Vegetables, or that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and conſerved in the ſame <hi>Species;</hi> ſince the modifications and qualifications of Matter are various, and irregular, and infinite, neither do they keep in one fixed modification or qualification, but the ſame is hourly changed. It remains therefore, that although we ſhould admit ſuch a <hi>Natura ſenſitiva</hi> or <hi>ignea,</hi> either in ſome common Maſſes, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed and diffuſed through the whole Maſs of Elementary mixed Matter, we muſt be fain to ſuppoſe ſomething elſe that muſt determin theſe common and Homogeneal Principles into determinate <hi>Species;</hi> or at leaſt, that there are as many Senſitive Natures ſpecifically diſtinct as there are <hi>Species</hi> of Animals in the World. Theſe Suppoſitions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not ſufficient to explicate the firſt productions of perfect Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, at leaſt without multiplication of inevident and unexplicable Suppoſitions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I therefore come to that true, and plain, and neceſſary Concluſion, That the firſt production of Mankind, yea and of perfect Animals, was wrought immediately by the Efficacy of an Intelligent, Wiſe, and Powerful Being, diſtinct from the things produced: and this is the great Truth that in all this Diſcourſe I aimed at, and am now arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at.</p>
               <p>And I ſhall not need go any farther for the evidence of this Truth, than the Contemplation of the Thing it ſelf, (Man,) in which we ſhall find ſo many clear Evidences of an Intelligent Efficient, that we need no other, and the common Inſtances will evidence the Reaſonableneſs of ſuch a Conſequence. If I ſhould behold a Houſe with ſeveral Rooms and Stories, excellently contrived with all Offices and Conveniences for Uſe, Doors, Windows, Chimneys, Stairs, and every thing placed and digeſted with Order, Uſefulneſs, and Beauty, a little Logick will induce me to conclude that it was the Work of an intelligent and skilful Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, though I did not ſee him building or finiſhing it. If I ſhould ſee a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Watch, curiouſly wrought, graved, and enameled, and ſhould obſerve the exact diſpoſition of the Spring, the String, the Wheels, the Ballance, the Index, and by an excellent, orderly, regular Motion deſcribed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Hour of the Day, Day of the Month, and divers other

regular and curious Motions: Or if I ſhould ſee ſuch a goodly <hi>Machina</hi> as ſome aſcribe to <hi>Archimedes,</hi> whereby in diſtinct Spheres or Orbs the ſituation of the Elementary and Celeſtial World were repreſented, and all theſe put into their ſeveral Motions, conſonant to that we ſee in the Heavenly Bodies, by the means of Springs or Weights artificially placed, I ſhould moſt reaſonably conclude, that theſe were neither Caſual not ſimply Natural Productions, but they were the Work of ſome intelligent curious Artiſt, that by deſign, intention and appropriation wrought and put in order and motion theſe curious <hi>Automata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly, if I or any Man of Reaſon ſhould in this moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a parcel of red Clay, and in a moment ſhould ſee that ariſe into the Figure of a Man, full of Beauty and Symmetry, endued with all thoſe Parts and Faculties which I ſee in my ſelf, and poſſibly far more glorious, exquiſite, and beautiful; and I ſhould obſerve him preſently after this Formation uſe all the Operations of Life, Senſe and Reaſon, and this kind of production never ſeen before: That common Reaſon which ſhould tutor me to think that that Watch, that <hi>Machina</hi> before mentioned was the Work of an Intelligent Nature, would much more enforce me to believe that this admirable and ſtupendious production of ſuch a Nature unexampled before, would enforce me to believe and confeſs that this were the immediate Work not only of an Intelligent Being, but of a moſt Wiſe and Powerful Being, that could thus in a moment frame, animate, and endow ſuch an excellent Creature as this.</p>
               <p>And yet certainly the firſt created Parents of Mankind were conſtitute in a Nature ſpecifically conformable unto that Nature which Mankind now hath, and as we have no reaſon to believe they were any way inferior to the preſent Perfection of Humane Nature, ſo we have very great reaſon to ſuppoſe them conſtituted in a greater degree of Beauty and Perfection than the moſt perfect Man that hath been ever ſince their Formation, (except the incarnate Son of God.)</p>
               <p>Although I do not intend in this place to take a large Survey of the Perfection of the Humane Nature, becauſe it is in part done already, and I ſhall reſerve it, God willing, for its proper place and ſeaſon; yet becauſe my Scope here is to evince, that the Suppoſition of the firſt production of Mankind is an unqueſtionable Evidence of the Exiſtence of a moſt Wiſe and Intelligent Being; and that the ſtrength of that Evidence reſts in the due Contemplation of the Excellence of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature and Faculties, and thoſe other Appendices thereunto; and that it is not poſſible to conceive any other but an Intelligent Efficient (working by Choice, Wiſdom, and Appropriation) ſhould be the firſt Producent, Former, and Conſtituent of ſuch a Nature. I ſhall take a ſhort Survey of the Humane Nature, Perfections, and Appendices, which may give any Man a handle to improve it farther to the ſame end; leaving the fuller Diſcourſe of the Humane Nature as a Reſerve, alſo whereupon a fuller Improvement may be made of this Conſideration and Concluſion.</p>
               <p>And upon the diligent Obſervation of this Argument it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, That the modelling, framing, compounding, ordering, and endowing the firſt Prototype and firſt Copy of the Humane Nature
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64147:168"/>
was neither an Act or Event of Chance, or of a Surd, Inanimate, Unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Nature, but was a Contrivance and Work of Deſign, Skill, and Intention, a Tranſcript of that <hi>Idea</hi> which reſided in an intelligent Being, a Work of a wiſe and powerful Being; yea ſuch a Work as could never have been made by any leſs than the moſt intelligent, wiſe, and powerful Being, exceeding the more ſingle Wiſdom and Activity of any created Intelligence at leaſt, unleſs acting in and by the Commiſſion, Virtue, and Strength of the Almighty God.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Excellencies in Man that demonſtrate an Intelligent Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient are of two kinds, 1. Such as immediately concern his nature: 2. Such as are diſtinct from it, but relating to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore concerning thoſe Excellencies that concern immediately his Nature; and theſe diſcover themſelves and the Wiſdom of their Efficient. And theſe Excellencies are conſidered either ſimply in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or 2. <hi>Compoſitè,</hi> and with the ſeveral Subſerviences and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations to their Ends and Uſes.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt Conſideration, there are many Excellencies in the Humane Nature which manifeſt a far more eminent Excellency in his firſt Efficient.</p>
               <p>The Symmetry, Beauty, Majeſty, and admirable Compoſure of his Body, to which there can be nothing added, nor detracted, without a blemiſh to it.</p>
               <p>The admirable Faculties of his Soul, thoſe that concern him in his loweſt rank of Life, the Faculty by which he is nouriſhed; thoſe that concern him in his middle rank of Life, Soul and Senſation, Memory and Appetite; thoſe that concern him in his ſupreme rank of Life, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect and Will; thoſe that concern him in his whole <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> the Generative Faculty.</p>
               <p>The admirable Union of his Soul to his Body, whereby he becomes one Intellectual Being, though conſiſting of Principles of differing natures.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch as theſe would be largely proſecuted, for they do evidence an intellectual, moſt wiſe Efficient, that could thus erect, and thus endow ſuch a Fabrick. But that which I moſt reckon upon, is that admirable Accommodation that is found in the nature of Man, which doth moſt undeniably demonſtrate an intellectual and wiſe Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, working by Intention and Deſign: for inſtance, It is indeed a very great evidence of an Artiſt that can make the Wheel of a Watch, or the Spring, or the Ballance, but the deſtination of the Spring to the String, and the String to the Fuſee, and the accommodation of every Wheel, and their poſition and fabrick one to another, and the Ballance to correct and check the exceſs of the Motion, and the Index to the Table, and to fit the Table with Diviſions ſuitable to the Hours, and to put all into ſuch a regular Motion as demonſtrates the Hour of the Day: This adaptation of things of various and ſeveral Natures and Structures one to another, and all to ſome common End or Deſign, is ſo great an evidence of an Intellectual Being that works by Intention, by Election, by Deſign and Appropriation; that nothing can be oppoſed againſt it: And therefore I rather chooſe to proſecute this compound Conſideration of the Humane Nature, the adaptation and appropriation
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:64147:168"/>
of things therein one to another, and to common Uſe; which is the moſt evident Argument of ſuch an Efficient as I have before deſcribed in the firſt Fabrication of Humane Nature.</p>
               <p>It were the buſineſs of a Volume to purſue all the Particulars of this kind, I ſhall only inſtance in ſome.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The admirable accommodation of the ſeveral Parts of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body to make up one <hi>Continuum,</hi> yet conſiſting of divers Parts diſtinct in their individuals and kinds, the mortiſing of the Bones one into another, the binding them together by Nerves and Muſcles and Tendons, the Veins and Arteries for the carrying of the Blood diffuſed by ſeveral Ramifications from their Roots to the uttermoſt extremities of the Body, their differing Coats, <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi> and means of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication for the Circulation of the Blood, the diſtributions and ramifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Nerves; indeed the whole Frame of the Humane Body is an Engin of moſt admirable contrivance and mutual accommodation of Parts, which is ſo much the more admirable, becauſe many of the Parts are diſtinct not only in the Roots and Numbers, but in their Nature and Conſtitution; yet make up one moſt beautiful <hi>Continuum,</hi> by the mutual accommodation and admirable contignation of the ſeveral Integrals thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The admirable accommodation of Faculties to the convenience and uſe of Humane Nature, for Inſtance, the Digeſtive Faculty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Life, the Generative Faculty to preſerve the <hi>Species;</hi> his Faculties of Senſe are accommodated to a Senſible Being, for as much as he is to converſe in a Corporeal World, and with Corporeal Beings, there is no one quality of Corporeal Nature that he hath occaſion to uſe or converſe with, but he hath a Faculty by one of his five Senſes to receive and diſcern. Again, in his Intellective Faculty it admirably ſerves him for the Ends and Uſes of his Being; he was appointed to govern, direct, and rule other Animals, and therefore he hath the advantage of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Faculty above them, whereby he is able to exerciſe that Direction and Government: He was made to be the Spectator of the great Work of God, to conſider and obſerve them, to glorifie and ſerve that God that made them; and he is accordingly furniſhed with an Intellective Faculty anſwerable to his condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The admirable accommodation of Faculties with ſubminiſtring Faculties, and Organs ſubſervient, appropriate, and convenient for their exerciſe: For Inſtance, Local Motion is neceſſary to Mankind, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he is furniſhed with Animal Spirit, Nerves, Muſcles, Tendons, and Limbs admirably contrived, and deſtined, and fitted to Local Motion. The Intellective Faculty is furniſhed with the organical Fabrick of the Brain, and the ſubordinate Power of Senſe, Phantaſie and Memory, to aſſiſt it in its exerciſe while it is in the Body: <hi>Facultati generativae &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſicae ſubministrans facultas ſeminificationis, ac organa eidem deſervientia, appetitus naturalis, voluptas quaedam alliciens organa generationi dicata, &amp; diſtinctio ſexuum, ſine qua juxta legem in natura poſt primam humanae naturae formationem inſitam, hujuſmodi ſpeciei propagatio fieri nequivit.</hi> The Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive Faculty, furniſhing the Blood, the Blood increaſing the Body, and ſupplying the Treaſuries of the Spirits, the Spirits again ſupplying and maintaining the Offices of the Faculties. So that not only the Blood,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:64147:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but the whole Corporeal and Animal Nature is in continued motion and mutual ſubſerviency.</p>
               <p>I might be endleſs in this Contemplation, but becauſe it is evident to any Man that conſiders, and I deſign a larger diſcuſſion of this Buſineſs when I come to conſider the Parts and Faculties of the Humane Nature, I ſhall not give farther Inſtances therein.</p>
               <p>And the Uſe that I make of it is this, That although it might be ſuppoſed poſſible, that either Chance or Nature might in ſome ſimple narrow things produce very curious Appearances, as the Configurations of <hi>Aſterites,</hi> of Cryſtals, of Salts in their ſeveral ſhapes; yet when in ſuch a complicated Nature as Man is, conſiſting of ſo many various Parts, various in their poſition, nature, and uſe, there ſhall be found ſuch an exact adaptation of every thing one to another, as to ſerve the whole and every part; this in the primordial Conſtitution and Formation muſt needs be the Work of a moſt wiſe, intelligent, powerful Being, that operates <hi>ſecundùm intentionem, appropriationem, &amp; intelligentiam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us come then to thoſe Appendices and relative Reſpects of other things to the Humane Nature, we ſhall eaſily find in it this Conſideration alſo, the Footſteps and Evidences of an Intelligent Nature in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of him, by that admirable accommodation of things without him of different nature from him, to his uſe and convenience.</p>
               <p>In the Operations or Works of Intelligent Agents we may eaſily ſee, that according to the degree or perfection of ſuch Intelligence there is variety in their Work or Production: An Intelligent Agent that is but of a narrow Intelligence, as his Proſpect is commonly ſhort and weak, ſo his Work ſeldom attains more than a narrow and ſingle End. But if the Agent be of a large and comprehenſive Intelligence and Wiſdom, his ends are great, and moſt times various and complicated, and the ſame Operation or Work may have divers many <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Ends and Uſes.</p>
               <p>Almighty God therefore being of infinite Wiſdom and Power, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees and effects great and various Ends in one and the ſame Work or Operation: Take for Inſtance that goodly Creature the Sun, What a complication of excellent Ends and Uſes there are in that glorious Body? It is the Fountain, communicating Light to the Earth, the Air, and all the Planetary Bodies; it is that which derives Heat, and is the great Inſtrument of deriving Fruitfulneſs and Fertility to the inferior World; it diſtinguiſheth Times and Seaſons by its Motion; it raiſeth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth, and diſtributeth the Watry Meteors for the benefit of this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior World, and infinite more advantages of this kind. And therefore it is the narrowneſs of our Underſtanding, that when we ſee one excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent End or Uſefulneſs in any thing, to conclude, that God Almighty intended no other.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is too haſty and vain a Concluſion, to think that the glorious Bodies of the Celeſtial Hoſt were made meerly for the ſervice of Man; and it is alſo folly and preſumption to conclude, that even the things of this inferior World, though principally deſigned for the uſe of Man, were meerly and only deſtined for the ſervice of Man: Almighty God hath the Glory of his own Greatneſs, and the Communication of his own Goodneſs, as the great End of all his Works: Yea and we have reaſon to think, that even in theſe inferior Beings of this lower World
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:64147:169"/>
which are delivered over to the uſe and ſervice of Men, God Almighty had other Ends that poſſibly we know not, nay poſſibly in the Effection of the leaſt minute Animal Almighty God intended a Communication of ſo much of his Goodneſs and Beneficence to it, as might give it a kind of complacency and fruition ſuitable to the capacity of its Exiſtence, though ſubordinate to other Ends.</p>
               <p>And yet not only in theſe inferior Exiſtences of this lower World, but even in the Fabrick, Order, and Oeconomy of the ſuperior World there is to be found an admirable accommodation of them one to another, and to this Steward and Tenant of Almighty God of this inferior World, called Man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we look upon the Celeſtial World, we have an admirable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation thereof to the convenience of Mankind; it preſents to his View, and thereby to his Underſtanding, the moſt noble Spectacle of the Celeſtial Bodies, their Order, Beauty, Conſtancy, Motion, Light, conducting to the knowledge and acknowledgment of the Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of God: it gives him an account of the progreſs, and parts, and ſucceſſion of Time; theſe are advantages that no Irrational Nature can make uſe of.</p>
               <p>But the Influence of the Heavens are a common Benefit to Man and all Sublunary Natures; but yet the inferior World ſeems in a great meaſure directed for the benefit of Mankind; ſome in common to him and the Brutes, as the Air for Reſpiration, the Fire for Warmth, the Water for Drink, the Earth for Fruit and Habitation.</p>
               <p>But in this lower World there ſeems many things directed to the ſpecial uſe of Mankind; for beſides Domeſtick Animals eſpecially allowed for his Food, there are ſome that ſerve for his Employment, Motion, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and Food, as the Tillage and Planting of the Earth for his Food; ſome for his Medicine, as Herbs, and Gums, and Minerals; ſome for his Clothing, as the Furrs, Wool, and Skins of Beaſts; ſome for his Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as the Timber and Stone; ſome for his Fewel, as Wood, Coals, and Turf; ſome for his Defence and Manufacture, as Iron and Steel; ſome for Commerce, as the Metals of Silver, Gold, Copper, the very Situation of the Seas, the <hi>Magnes;</hi> ſome for his Ornament, as Silk and Jewels; ſome for his Journey and Labour, as Horſes, Oxen, Camels; ſome for his Neceſſity, ſome for his Delight: Infinite more Inſtances may be given, whereby it will evidently appear that this lower World is accommodated to the uſe and convenience of Mankind in a ſpecial and remarkable manner; whereby it may be evident to any conſiderate Man, that the Formation of the World and of Mankind was by the ſame wiſe and provident Power; and that as the Humane Nature is accommodated to it ſelf, ſo this World is accommodated to the exigence and convenience of the Humane Nature.</p>
               <p>When I have conſidered the admirable Congruity of all the Parts of Chriſtian Religion, and how it correſponds, and is adapted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and condition of the Humane Nature, and how thoſe antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Propheſies, Promiſes, and Directions of Religion in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bear an admirable congruity to the Model of Religion in the New Teſtament, notwithſtanding the vaſt diſtances between the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of them, and how all the Scheme of Divine Diſpenſations
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:64147:170"/>
from the beginning of the World bear an admirable accommodation each to other, and to the Evangelical Doctrin; it gives us a ſtrong Moral Evidence that the ſame one God was the Author of this Religion, that although there ſeem a diverſity and variety in the Adminiſtrations, yet when I look upon them together, compare the congruity of what goes before to what follows, it ſeems one moſt beautiful Piece, fitted and accommodated in every part to the other; and hereby I ſatisfie my ſelf that it is the true Religion, that it is all of one piece, and one common Author of it, namely, the God of Truth.</p>
               <p>And ſo when I conſider the Humane Nature, and the admirable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation that one part thereof hath to the other, and alſo look upon the <hi>Mundus aſpectabilis,</hi> eſpecially this lower World, wherewith we are by reaſon of its vicinity beſt acquainted, and obſerve how admirably the ſame is accommodated to the Animal Life of Man: And although the Parts thereof are diſtinct, various, diſtant, yet there are drawn from it Lines of Accommodations and Communication to the Uſe of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, ſo exactly and appoſitly, that I cannot chooſe but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one common Author both of the greater and leſſer World, and ſuch an Author, as made and diſpoſed all things by the higheſt Wiſdom and the wiſeſt Choice. If there had been divers Authors of the greater and leſſer World, there could never have been an accommodation of things ſo diſparate one to another, unleſs both had acted in ſubordination to one common third Being, or by one common Counſel.</p>
               <p>Again, it was not poſſible that Caſualty or Chance could have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated things of various kinds one to another: If Chance could make a Beam of a Houſe, and could have made Tenents at either end, yet it is not poſſible to conceive that Chance could caſt it to be juſt of a fit length to anſwer the congruity of its contignation to another piece of Timber, or fit the Mortiſes of other pieces of Timber to thoſe Tenents, or fit the particles and ſcantlets to anſwer juſt one another; this muſt of neceſſity require a Workman that works by Underſtanding, Choice, and Appropriation, becauſe it requires accommodation of ſeveral things of ſeveral kinds to one End by ſeveral Means.</p>
               <p>Thus therefore when I ſee the admirable accommodation of Humane Nature to its own exiſtence and conveniences, the admirable accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation therein of things of different natures one to another, as Organs to Faculties, Sinews to Bones, Nerves to Muſcles, Spirits to Nerves; when I ſee the excellent accommodation of this lower World, eſpecially to the Humane Nature, although they are in themſelves ſeveral and hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneal, I cannot (without violence to my own Obſervation, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and Reaſon) I ſay I cannot but attribute the firſt Formation of Humane Nature, yea and of all the Univerſe, to one moſt Wiſe, Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, Powerful Being; who did all things according to the counſel of his Will, after the moſt wiſe and excellent <hi>Idea</hi> of his unſearchable Underſtanding.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CAP. V.</hi> Concerning the Nature of that Intelligent Agent that first formed the Humane Nature; and ſome Objections against the Inferences above made, and their Anſwer.</head>
               <p>HAving in the foregoing Chapter reduced the Origination of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to an Intelligent Efficient, effecting it <hi>per modum efficientis voluntarii, &amp; per intentionem,</hi> I ſhall in this place inquire what kind of Intelligent Efficient this was, for among Intelligent Beings there is one <hi>Primum,</hi> the Glorious God, whoſe Underſtanding, Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is infinite; there are alſo acknowledged by the Heathen, <hi>Intelligentiae à primo,</hi> thoſe which <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls by the Name of Separate Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, <hi>Plato</hi> calls <hi>Dii ex Diis,</hi> and we commonly call Angels, very glorious and powerful Creatures, which <hi>Plato</hi> takes into the Buſineſs of the Creation of Man, as to the Corporeal Frame.</p>
               <p>And it ſeems to be, that the Effection of the Humane Nature in any part thereof, is not attributable to the Angels, neither as inſtrumental, much leſs as principal Cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Soul of Man it ſeems beyond diſpute, for that was a created Subſtance, and Creation of any new Subſtance being an infinite Motion, is not within the power of any Finite Nature: the Pretence therefore reſts only as to the Corporeal, or at leaſt Animal Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore I ſay that the Formation of the Bodily, much leſs the Animal Nature of Man, in order to the reception of the Soul, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coordinately nor inſtrumentally the Work of Angels. And the Reaſons that ſeem ſufficient to make out this Truth, are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſeems utterly above an Angelical Power to organize the Body of the Humane Nature: for though it is true, that in the eſtabliſhed way of Generation, the Parents, who are inferior in nature to Angels, do organize the Body, at leaſt <hi>mediante ſemine,</hi> yet that is done in the virtue and ſtrength of the Ordination and Inſtitution of Almighty God: So that as well Man as the <hi>Semen genitale</hi> are the Inſtruments deputed by Almighty God in virtue of his Supreme Power to propagate the Humane Nature. And therefore ſince the firſt Formation of the Humane Nature was a new Formation, not according to the Laws eſtabliſhed after in Nature, the firſt Production of Mankind was immediately by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, and not by the Power of any ſubordinate Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, it could not poſſibly be, but that the Humane Nature muſt be completed in an inſtant: For how is it conceptible, that firſt there ſhould be <hi>Corpus formatum,</hi> with all the Organs, Veſſels, Blood, and Spirits diſpoſed and ordered in their ſeveral Cells and Motions, unleſs Man had been then at the ſame time animated as well as organized? For the outward ſhape or ſtature of a Man is no more a fit Receptacle of an Animal, much leſs of a Rational Life, than a Statue of Wax or Stone. The ſame Hand therefore that animated; formed and faſhioned alſo the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:64147:171"/>
ſame Humane Body in the ſame moment, by virtue of the Volition, Determination, or <hi>Faciamus</hi> of the Divine Will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As we have no manner of evidence of the Angelical concurrence or inſtrumentality in the Formation of Man or of any of the lower Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals ſo there is no neceſſity at all of ſuch a Suppoſition. And we are not to multiply Cauſes without neceſſity, for as the bare determination of the moſt powerful and efficacious Will of God was ſufficient to bring Being out of Nothing, ſo the like determination of the ſame Will was ſufficient to form Man out of the Duſt of the ground, without taking in a ſubordination or inſtrumentality of Angels.</p>
               <p>Again, if we ſhould ſuppoſe the cooperation of Angels in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Body of Man, it muſt be in the ſtrength, virtue, and efficiency of the firſt Cauſe; which as it gave the Angels their Being, ſo it muſt give them the efficacy power, and virtue to be inſtrumental in this Formation; which as we have no warrant, ſo we have no probable reaſon to admit, ſince the firſt Cauſe was all ſufficient for this Effect without their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The admirable Structure of the Body of Man, the accommodation of it to Faculties, the furniſhing of it with Faculties accommodate to it, even as its Animal Nature (though we take not in the reaſonable intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Soul) imports in it a Wiſdom, Power, and Efficacy above the Power of any created Nature to effect: If it ſhould be in the power of an Angel, by applying actives to paſſives, to produce an Inſect, nay a perfect Animal, yet the Conſtitution and Frame of ſo much of that in Man that concerns his Animal Nature were too high a Copy for an Angelick Nature to write, unleſs thereunto deputed and commiſſionated by the Infinite God, which Commiſſion we no where find, and I am very ſure a bare Naturaliſt will not ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, there is that neceſſity of a ſuitableneſs and accommodation of the Parts of the Body to the Faculties of the Soul, and <hi>è converſo,</hi> that any the leaſt diſproportion or diſaccommodation of one to the other would ſpoil the whole Work, and make them utterly unſerviceable and unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable one to the other. It was therefore of abſolute neceſſity that the ſame skill and dexterity that was requiſite to the firſt Formation of the Soul, muſt be uſed and employed in the Formation of the Body; and if an Angel were unequal to the making up and ordering of the Soul, he could never be ſufficient to make a fit organical Body exactly ſuitable to it.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter I therefore conclude, That not only the Soul, but the very Animal Nature in Man, and not only that, but the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Deſtination of his Bodily Frame, was not only the Work of an Intelligent Being, but of the Infinite and Omnipotent Intelligent Being, who in the ſame moment formed his Body, and organized it with immediate Organs and Inſtruments of Life and Senſe, and created his Intellectual Nature, and united it to him, whereby Man became a living Soul.</p>
               <p>And this, as the neceſſary Evidence of Reaſon, doth firſt drive us to acknowledge a Being, or firſt Formation of the Humane Nature <hi>ex non genitis;</hi> and ſecondly, to acknowledge that this firſt Formation of the Nature of Man was not by Chance, Caſualty, or a meer Syntax of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:64147:171"/>
Natural Cauſes, but by an Intelligent Efficient; ſo we are upon the very ſame and a greater Evidence of Reaſon, driven to acknowledge that Intelligent Efficient to be the Great and Wiſe and Glorious God, no other Cauſe imaginable being <hi>par tali negotio.</hi>

               <p>And indeed, if once we can bring Men but to this one Conceſſion, That the original Efficient of the Humane Nature was an Intelligent Being, any Man pretending to Reaſon will with much leſs difficulty admit that Efficient to be the Almighty God, than any other inviſible, intelligent Efficient, which we uſually call Angels or Intelligences: And the Reaſons are theſe, 1. Becauſe though we that are acquainted with the Divine Truths do as really believe that there are Angels as well as Men, yet the Natural Evidences of the Exiſtence of Almighty God are far more evident and convincing, even upon a Rational and Natural account, than that there are Angels; for the former being a Truth of the higheſt moment and importance to be believed by all, hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable weight and clearneſs of evidence, even to Natural Light, more and greater than any other Truth: And hence among the <hi>Jews</hi> the Sect of the <hi>Sadduces</hi> believed the Exiſtence of God, yet denied or doubted the Exiſtence of Angels or ſeparated Intelligences. 2. Becauſe the very Suppoſition of an Angelical Nature doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe the Exiſtence of a Supreme Being, from whom they derive their Exiſtences. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the great occaſion of Infidelity in relation to Exiſtence of Almighty God is, that ſenſual Men are not willing to believe any thing whereby they have not a ſufficient Evidence, as they think, to their Senſe: The Notion of a Spiritual and Immaterial Being is a thing that they cannot digeſt, becauſe they cannot ſee or by any Senſe perceive it, nor eaſily form to themſelves a Notion of it. He therefore that can ſo far maſter the ſtubborneſs of Senſe, as to believe ſuch a Spriritual Intelligent Being as an Angel, hath conquered that difficulty that moſt incumbers his belief of a God, and we that can but ſuppoſe or admit the former, cannot long doubt of the latter. He therefore that can once bring his thoughts to carry the firſt Origination of Mankind to the efficiency of an Angel, muſt needs in a little time ſee a greater evidence not only to believe a Supreme Deity, but to attribute the Origination of Mankind and of the goodly Frame of the Univerſe to the Supreme Being; as neceſſarily beſt fitted with Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs to accompliſh ſo great a Work, and that without the help or intervention of Angels or created Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, who muſt needs derive their Being, Power, and Activity from him.</p>
               <p>There remains two or three Objections againſt the force of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the Exiſtence of Almighty God, and his Efficiencies in the production of Mankind in their firſt Individuals, which I ſhall propound and anſwer.</p>

                  </label> What need there be laid ſo great a ſtreſs upon the Primitive Formation of Man, as that it could not be done but by the Power and Wiſdom of an Almighty Intelligent Being? ſince every day's experience lets us ſee, that by the mixture and coition of Man and Woman, <hi>Et ex ſemine ab utroque deciſo, in utèro muliebri per ſpatium decem menſium ad plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimum producitur hujuſmodi natura humana, quem tot elogiis magnificamus;</hi> that which we every day ſee to be an effect of finite Creatures in the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:64147:172"/>
daily production of Individuals of Humane Nature: Why muſt we needs call in no leſs than the Wiſdom and Power of God himſelf, to be the immediate Efficient of the firſt Formation of the Individuals of that nature, which we ſee every day produced by the common efficacy of Nature and efficiency of the Parents; <hi>Vel ad minus, ſeminis utriuſque ſexus in utero foemineo concluſi?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Anſwer hereunto, I ſhall not at this time or in this place enter into the diſpute how far the Divine Efficiency concurrs immediately in the ordinary Generation of Mankind, nor how far the entire Humane Nature, as well his Rational Soul as his Body and Animal Nature, is attributable to Parental Generation, theſe will be proper for another place: but for a full Anſwer hereunto I ſay, 1. That there is not the ſame meaſure to be taken of the competency or ſufficiency of an Efficient in the production of the Humane Nature, as it ſtands now eſtabliſhed, and in the firſt formation of the firſt Individuals of that nature <hi>ex non genitis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, it is in ſetled and eſtabliſhed Nature, within the compaſs of the immediate efficiency of both Sexes, <hi>&amp; ſeminis prolifici ab eiſdem deciſi,</hi> to form the Humane Nature in that gradual proceſs and method that is now conſonant to Nature; but if all the Men on Earth and Angels in Heaven ſhould now go about to form the Humane Nature <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> either out of the Elementary Material, or by the help and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Celeſtial Influences, or by any Irradiation even from an Angelick Nature, it could not be done; It was therefore a vain piece of madneſs <hi>Paracelſus</hi> to pretend to the formation of a <hi>Homunculus,</hi> when by all his pretended Skill he could not protract his own Life, being already conſtituted to the common period of an ordinary old age. But 2. This <hi>Poteſtas generativa</hi> in the Humane Nature is part of that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Efficiency which Almighty God exerciſed in the firſt Formation of Mankind and of other perfect Animals; and this Faculty is performed in the Humane Nature, and traduced from one to another by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate efficacy, virtue, and energy of that firſt Divine Efficiency. In this Generative Faculty therefore though the Parents are not ſimply paſſive Inſtruments, the <hi>Semen prolificum</hi> is not meerly a paſſive Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the production of Humane Nature, yet both are Inſtruments, and <hi>Efficientes vicariae &amp; ſubordinatae,</hi> in reſpect of Almighty God; and the activity that either of theſe Inſtruments have, they have from that God that firſt formed the Humane Nature, and implanted and alligated this activity to them. In the firſt formation of the firſt Individuals of Humane Nature this <hi>Vis prolifica</hi> was immediately conſtituted in them by Almighty God, with power not only to produce their kind, but to tranſmit this <hi>Vis prolifica</hi> to thoſe they ſo produced: and although the immediate production now ſeems to be by the immediate efficiency of the Parents, and their prolifick <hi>Semen,</hi> yet it is done by virtue, and in the power of the firſt efficiency of Almighty God; <hi>Qui cum hanc indidit primis individuis in eorum prima formatione, ac perpetua quadam lege ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivis individuis quaſi alligavit &amp; connexit.</hi> So that as when I behold a Man at this day, his corporeal Figure, his Faculties, I ſee but as it were a Copy or Tranſcript of the firſt created nature of Man in the firſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, I mean as to their Eſſentials; ſo I look upon the ſucceſſive
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:64147:172"/>
Generations of Mankind, to be but a continuation of that firſt generative Faculty concreated with the firſt Man, and protracted or extended unto all ſucceeding deſcendents from him: And therefore I have all the reaſon imaginable, when I behold the ſucceſſive Generations of Men, and the actuating of that Faculty, <hi>retro trahere ad primam originem;</hi> and to acknowledge it to be no leſs the Efficacy of the Divine Efficiency in the thouſandth Generation from <hi>Adam,</hi> than it was in <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf: Juſt as if I ſhould take a Wedge of Silver of one Inch ſquare, and gild it over with Gold, and ſhould after draw it by Art into a Wire as ſmall as a Hair, to a Mile in length, every Inch of that ſilver Wire hath the very ſame tincture which the firſt Wedge had: Though this reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance holds not in all things, it ſerves to explicate what I mean, namely, the <hi>Facultas generativa,</hi> which was by God Almighty given to the firſt Parents of Mankind, and was bound to their <hi>Species.</hi> And though it be now at a remoter diſtance from its firſt efficiency, yet it hath its continuance and efficacy by virtue of that Firſt Efficiency, and the Inſtitution and Ordination of that moſt Wiſe and Powerful Being. So that even at this day the univocal generation of Man (yea and of all perfect Animals) is no leſs the Efficiency of Almighty God than it was in the firſt production of it, though it be more remote in reſpect of the intervenience of more ſucceſſive inſtrumental Cauſes. And therefore we are miſtaken, if we think that the generation of Men or Animals is purely by virtue of the inſtrumental Cauſes, without regard to the firſt Efficiency of Almighty God; which though it perpetuates it in a ſetled regular way, now called therefore Natural, yet it is by the Force, Virtue, and continuing Energy of the firſt wiſe, powerful, and efficacious Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Almighty God. And ſo nothing is gotten by this Objection, but to re-mind us to acknowledge and admire the admirable Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs of God, in the firſt eſtabliſhment and continued protraction of this Law of Seminal Propagation.</p>
               <p>And this is the true reaſon of the conſtancy and fixedneſs of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Generation, and why they do not <hi>tranſire ultra limites;</hi> why thoſe Animals that are produced <hi>per ovum,</hi> do not, cannot produce vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous, as Birds, and ſome ſorts of Fiſhes; and why thoſe that produce <hi>vivipara,</hi> or <hi>per vermem,</hi> do not produce <hi>per ovum;</hi> why without extreme accidents all perfect Animals produce Individuals conformable to their own ſimilitude, and ſpecifick nature and likeneſs; namely, this is the true reaſon, In the firſt formation of the Individual of theſe <hi>Species,</hi> the moſt Wiſe God, who foreſaw what was moſt fit and convenient, did engrave theſe ſeveral Laws and inviolable Conſtitutions in the natures of the things firſt produced, and chained and connected them to their <hi>Species</hi> by an inviolable Law, not regularly changeable by any Power but by his Power that Enacted them: And therefore it is not in the power of an Angel to alter the eſtabliſhed Method of the Generation of things, becauſe it is a Law inſtituted by the Supreme Lord. And although Monſtrous Births may caſually ariſe, as in due time may be obſerved, yet the production of <hi>vivipara per ovum,</hi> or of <hi>ovipara per vermem,</hi> or of Men or perfect Animals, <hi>aliter quam per conjunctionem maris &amp; foeminae,</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the ſetled and fixed Laws eſtabliſhed by the God of Nature in the firſt formation of Individuals.</p>

                  </label> You lay much ſtreſs upon the admirable Fabrick not only of Man but of perfect Animals, the regular and excellent order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of their Parts, the accommodation of their Organs to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and of their Faculties to the convenience of their Nature: and yet there is ſcarce the ſmalleſt Inſect but hath the ſame Faculties and Organs as exquiſitly accommodated to their uſe as the greateſt Animal, nay they are ſo much the more curious, and the Art of the Artificer ſo much the more commendable by how much the ſmaller they are. If a Flea or a Fly hath as exact a ſymmetry, organization, and diverſity of Faculties as an Oſtridge or an Elephant; the curioſity of the Art is more admirable by the ſmalneſs of the Volume: And yet theſe do every day ariſe ſpontaneouſly, and it may be propagate their kind after their ſpontaneous production, or it may be have only the exiſtence of a Day; neither is it reaſonable to think that all theſe Inſects thus ſpontaneouſly ariſing, were firſt produced in the fifth or ſixth Day; or that the <hi>Semina formata</hi> of every Worm or Fly that hath ariſen this day or yeſterday, were created in the firſt Creation of things, and lay concealed and unactive for above 5000 Years; and yet in theſe <hi>ſponte nata</hi> we ſee no neceſſity nor evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of any immediate Divine Efficiency, for ſome are every day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>ex putri, ſine praeexiſtente ſemine.</hi> Why therefore is ſo much weight laid upon the firſt Origination of Man or perfect Animals, as if it muſt needs require the immediate interpoſition of Almighty God, when we are content to referr the Origination of Works poſſibly of as wonderful a fabrication as many at leaſt of perfect Animals, to a lower Cauſe?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, It is true that there is a great curioſity in the Texture and Faculty of Inſects, and that there are very many that ariſe not <hi>ex prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtente ſemine,</hi> but either of Vegetables, or of that which we uſually call <hi>Materia putris;</hi> and it will be too hard a task for any to maintain that all Inſects do ariſe of univocal Seeds derived from their own <hi>Species,</hi> or that all the <hi>Species</hi> of Inſects were created the fifth or ſixth Day; neither ſhall I with <hi>Scotus</hi> affirm that the Forms of ſuch Inſects are derived from Heaven, and diffuſed into Matter, whereby they mould themſelves into their diſtinct Exiſtences.</p>
               <p>But as the God of Nature gave a ſeminal prolifick power to perfect Animals and unto Men, and did bind and connex this Method of their future Generations unto their Nature, without which though they had been conſtituted otherwiſe in a moſt perfect Conſtitution, they could never have multiplied their kind. So as to the production of many Inſects, Almighty God hath given ſuch a prolifick nature to the Earth and Waters, in a certain due mixture irradiated and influenced by the Sun to produce divers ſorts of Inſects by virtue of theſe two great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions given to the Water, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.20. and to the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.24. as the two great prevailing Elements in ſpontaneous generations; and as by virtue of the Divine Benedictions given to Animals and Men, <hi>[Increaſe and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth and the Waters;] Gen.</hi> 1.22, 28. ſo by virtue of that firſt Command to the Waters and Earth, <hi>[Let the Waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life; and let the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, and the cattel and creeping thing, and the beast after his kind.]</hi> The ſpontaneous propagation of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:64147:173"/>
Inſects by the Earth is by virtue of this Command as effectual, and in its kind as natural by virtue of this eſtabliſhed Law, as the production of Animals <hi>per mixtionem,</hi> though not ſo perfect.</p>
               <p>And from the Efficacy of this Divine Inſtitution it comes to paſs, 1. That their Textures and Faculties are curiouſly diſpoſed; for the Elementary Nature in conjunction with the Heavenly Influence doth produce them as Inſtruments, and in the virtue of the firſt Inſtitution of the Glorious God. 2. That though there is a great variety and multiplicity in their <hi>Species,</hi> yet they are not infinite, but determinate. 3. That according to the variety of Climates and various diſpoſition of Matter, Inſects are variouſly produced: this Climate produceth that Inſect that another doth not; and this Herb, this Wood, this Fleſh, that Inſect that another doth not; and the ſame is obſerved in Herbs and ſpontaneous Plants.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that all the Art in the World can never make the meaneſt Inſect out of any other Matter, or any otherwiſe diſpoſed, or any otherwiſe irradiated, than what would of it ſelf naturally produce an Inſect of that kind: But this ſhall be farther illuſtrated in the Anſwer to the next Objection.</p>
               <p>But although it be true that theſe little Inſects diſcover the wonderful Wiſdom and Power of God, in their vicarious productions by the commiſſionated and influenced Elementary Nature, yet they come exceedingly ſhort of thoſe perfect Animals who have a nobler and more elaborate production by univocal generation, and infinitely ſhort of the excellency of the Humane Nature: And therefore there is no parity of Inſtance in the firſt formation of an Inſect <hi>ex non genitis,</hi> and the firſt formation of the Humane Nature: Every Year gives us Inſtances of a new ſpontaneous production of Inſects, and this by virtue of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive commiſſion and vital vigour thereby concredited to the Earth and Waters irradiated by the Sun. But never any Age gives ſo much as a ſhadow of an Inſtance of the production of any perfect Animals, much leſs of Man by any ſuch ſpontaneous Method; and that the latter gives a greater and more eminent <hi>Specimen</hi> of a Divine Power in its primitive formation, than the former in its ſpontaneous production.</p>
               <p>3. <label>Object.</label> It is evident that the malignant Spirits have power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Inſects, as appears by the Magicians producing of Frogs in <hi>Aegypt</hi> by their Enchantments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.7. and therefore the reſolution of the ſpontaneous productions of Inſects into the Energy of the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſeems unwarrantable. And if he may produce thoſe which are really endued with an Animal Life, why not thoſe Animals that have their ordinary production by univocal Generation, and why not alſo Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>And the Satyrs and Fauns whereof ſome of the Ancients write, ſeems to be productions out of the common road of humane production.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, 1. Touching the ſuppoſed Fauns and Satyrs, they were either Fables or Illuſions, and no credit to be given to the Hiſtories of them. 2. Admitting it ſhould be within the power of good or evil Angels to produce Inſects, yet it would be no conſequence from thence to their efficacy of producing perfect Animals, much leſs Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is in another ſuperior rank of Being above the nobleſt
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:64147:174"/>
Brutes, and exceſſively above the rank of Inſects: We might as well conclude, becauſe a Man can make a Candle he can make a Star. But 3. As to the efficacy of good or evil Angels in effecting of Inſects, 1. It is of no great difficulty to ſuppoſe that good or evil Angels may bring or tranſport the <hi>Semina</hi> or Spawn of Inſects to other places, and poſſibly thus it might be done by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Magicians. 2. It is very true, that the Angelick Natures have a very great knowledge of Natural Efficacies and Virtues, and a great power of tranſporting, uniting, and applying Actives to Paſſives; whatſoever therefore is effectible by the moſt congruous and efficacious application of Actives to Paſſives, is effectible by them. And ſince there are many Inſects that ariſe by the connatural efficacy of Elementary Matter, and by the due preparation of the ſame, and by the due application thereof unto the incidence of Celeſtial Heat and Influxes; it may be in the power of theſe knowing and active Spirits, by a tranſportation and application of ſuch Matter, and by the poſition of them in ſuch an Influence as is natural for their production, to be inſtrumental not only to the acceleration of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, but to the productions themſelves: But though ſtill the efficacy of the production is not applicable to the efficiency of theſe Spirits, but to the natural vigour of thoſe Natural Actives and Paſſives that are by them brought together, and they cannot produce a Fly or a Frog beyond the activity and efficacy of Elementary Matter and Celeſtial Heat: (And hence it was, that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Enchanters could produce Frogs out of the Rivers of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the aſſiſtance of evil Spirits, becauſe the Waters and temperament of the Soil and Climate was able to have done it, if thoſe parts thereof were tranſported and united unto one place, where being brought they would probably without the help of a Magician have been formed into that Inſect:) Yet when the ſame Artiſts were trying to produce Lice out of Duſt, a Matter ſimply unſuitable for ſuch a production, they could not effect it, but acknowledged it was the Finger of God: <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.18, 19. We ſee that Man by his little nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row skill and power, by applying Actives to Paſſives, may do things of not unlike a nature; as the acceleration of the growth of Seeds by Mineral Preparations, the production of Mites in Cheeſes by infuſing Wine; and many tell us of a ſtrange production and multiplication of ſome Inſects by the juxta-poſition of ſeveral Aſhes and Solutions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, and by other means: none of which ways are eſtranged from the knowledge of thoſe experienced Spirits.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems utterly beyond the power of any Created Nature to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any Inſect, but by the juxta-poſition and application of that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Body and Celeſtial Heat that is natural and proper for ſuch a production: and much more is it impoſſible for any Created Power to produce any Animal, though never ſo ſmall or inconſiderable, whoſe production is by the ſtanding and fixed Laws of Nature mancipated and chained to that common Method of Production ſetled in Nature, by the Conjunction of Sexes.</p>
               <p>And therefore, though an evil Angel may produce a Frog or Snake by the due application of Actives to Paſſives, as before is declared, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with all his power and skill produce a Dog or a Cat, or any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that by the Laws and Inſtitution of Nature is only producible by the Conjunction of Sexes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:64147:174"/>And the reaſon is, becauſe theſe Laws which are inſtituted and ſetled in Nature when it is fixed and eſtabliſhed, are no other than the Laws of the Sovereign Lord of Heaven and Earth; and although he may diſpenſe with, alter, or ſuſpend his own Laws, yet no created Being hath that power of it ſelf to ſuſpend or alter theſe Laws ſetled by the God of Nature, no not in any one individual thing; and therefore it is not poſſible for Angel or Devil, without the immediate Commiſſion from the God of Heaven, to make any ſpontaneous production of ſuch an Animal as by the eſtabliſhed Law of Nature is to be produced by natural propagation, and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But herein I do not underſtand, 1. Such Inſects as though producible by Propagation, yet are naturally likewiſe producible, <hi>ex putri,</hi> as Frogs, and many other Inſects; for Nature hath allowed them both ways of production. 2. Neither of Incubation; for many Animals that are <hi>ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>para,</hi> and cannot produce <hi>ovum foecundum ſine utriuſque ſexus natura,</hi> yet may be excluded by artificial Incubation as well as natural; this is not only within the power of Angels, by applying an artificial Heat, but even of any elſe. The Eggs in <hi>Egypt</hi> are hatched in the Sun, or by the heat of Ovens or warm Aſhes.</p>

               <p>UPon a diligent Obſervation of the various Suppoſitions and ſpecial Methods of the ancient Philoſophers, touching the Origination of Mankind and of the Univerſe in general, theſe improbabilities of their truth and ſufficiency will appear to any conſiderate Man. Firſt, They are deſtitute of any ſatisfactory Evidence, to any perſon that is not ſtrangely and impotently engaged to them, either becauſe they are his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, or the Conceptions of ſome perſons of whoſe Learning or Wit their Diſciples or Followers are too fond admirers. There are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly two Ingredients that make Men fond of a pre-conceived Opinion: 1. Self-love and admiration; when a Man hath faſhioned a Fancy or Imagination to ſome height, he falls in love with it becauſe it is his own, and is with great difficulty drawn from it. 2. Affectation of Eſteem, which hath a double effect upon Men, namely, the affectation of Praiſe and Vain-glory, as having found out ſome Conception ſingular, novel, or that may give a Man a name of a high Mercurial Wit; and on the other ſide, a ſhame and diſdain to retract that which he hath once publickly aſſerted.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that many of the ſeveral <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the <hi>Aristotelians, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans,</hi> and of divers of the other Ancients touching the original or funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſtate of the Univerſe and Mankind, are meer Inventions and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, having no other foundation or evidence of their truth, than meerly
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:64147:175"/>
their own Fancies and Conceptions. And it is not reaſonable to think it ſhould be otherwiſe; for ſince the Manner of the Origination of Things muſt in common Reaſon be thought to be of ſome other Mode or Order than what we ſee now in Nature, and ſince the particular Manner or Method of this Origination of Things is ſuch a Matter of Fact as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly lye in the compaſs of humane diſcovery meerly by the ſtrength of Ratiocination or a bare humane Tradition, (for it is a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact that precedes the ſuppoſed exiſtence of Memory, at leaſt of any Man) it muſt neceſſarily be that Mankind muſt be ignorant of it, unleſs it be revealed unto him by ſome that might certainly know the Fact it ſelf; and therefore the Conceptions of Men touching it muſt needs be as confuſed, roving, uncertain, and inevident, as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes or Conceptions of a blind Man that never ſaw, touching Light or Colours.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Medium</hi> of the diſcovery of the firſt Formation of things deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> is that which can only give us a true Notion of them, namely, Revelation to a Man that converſed with Almighty God face to face, and the Communication thereof to Mankind by this Man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired, and informed touching this Fact by him that alone could give him the true account thereof, namely, God himſelf. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I do not doubt, but beſides this Divine Revelation to <hi>Moſes,</hi> there was a Divine Manifeſtation thereof to the firſt created Man in that fulneſs of his firſt illuminated and perfect ſtate of created Nature, and from him that Tradition was derived, and preſerved in that Line of the Patriarchs in which the moſt important Divine Truths were conſerved, and traduced from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which may illuſtrate my meaning, in this preference of the revealed Light of the Holy Scriptures touching this matter, above the Eſſays of a Philoſophical Imagination, may be this: Suppoſe that <hi>Greece</hi> being unacquainted with the curioſity of Mechanical Engins, though known in ſome remote Region of the World, an excellent Artiſt had ſecretly brought and depoſited in ſome Field or Foreſt ſome excellent Watch or Clock, which had been ſo formed, that the original of its Motion were hidden, and involved in ſome cloſe contrived piece of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm, that this Watch was ſo framed that the Motion thereof might have laſted a Year, or ſome ſuch time as might give a reaſonable Period for Philoſophical Conjectures concerning it, and that in the plain Table there had not been only the deſcription and indication of Hours, but the configurations and indications of the various <hi>Phaſes</hi> of the Moon, the Motion and Place of the Sun in the Ecliptick, and divers other curious indications of Celeſtial Motions; and that the Scholars of the ſeveral Schools of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> of <hi>Plato</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Sects, had caſually in their walk found this admirable <hi>Automaton,</hi> what kind of work would there have been made by every Sect, in giving an account of this <hi>Phaenomenon?</hi> We ſhould have had the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Sect have told the by-ſtanders according to their pre-conceived <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that this was nothing elſe but an accidental concretion of Atoms, that haply faln together had made up the Index, the Wheels, the Ballance, and that being haply faln into this poſture, they were put into Motion. Then the <hi>Carteſian</hi> falls in with him, as to the main of their Suppoſition,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:64147:175"/>
but tells him, that he doth not ſufficiently explicate how this Engin is put into Motion; and therefore to furniſh this Motion there is a certain <hi>Materia ſubtilis</hi> that pervades this Engin, and the moveable parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of certain globular Atoms apt for Motion, they are thereby and by the mobility of the globular Atoms put into Motion. A third, finding fault with the two former, becauſe theſe Motions are ſo regular, and do expreſs the various <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the diſtribution of Time, and of the Heavenly Motions; therefore it ſeems to him, that this Engin and Motion alſo, ſo analogical to the Motions of the Heavens, was wrought by ſome admirable Conjunction of the Heavenly Bodies, which formed this Inſtrument and its Motions in ſuch an admirable correſpondency to its own exiſtence. A fourth, diſliking the Suppoſitions of the three former, tells the reſt that he hath a more plain and evident Solution of the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,</hi> namely, the Univerſal Soul of the World, or Spirit of Nature, that formed ſo many ſorts of Inſects with ſo many Organs, Faculties, and ſuch congruity of their whole Compoſition, and ſuch curious and various Motions as we may obſerve in them, hath formed and ſet into Motion this admirable <hi>Automaton,</hi> and regulated and ordered it with all theſe congruities we ſee in it. Then ſteps in an <hi>Ariſtotelian,</hi> and being diſſatisfied with all the former Solutions, tells them, Gentlemen, you are all miſtaken, your Solutions are inexplicable and unſatisfactory, you have taken up certain precarious <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> and being pre-poſſeſſed with theſe Creatures of your own Fancies, and in love with them, right or wrong you form all your Conceptions of things according to thoſe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied and pre-conceived Imaginations. The ſhort of the buſineſs is, this <hi>Machina</hi> is eternal, and ſo are all the Motions of it; and in as much as a Circular Motion hath no beginning or end, this Motion that you ſee both in the Wheels and Index, and the ſucceſſive indications of the Celeſtial Motions, is eternal, and without beginning. And this is a ready and expedite way of ſolving the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> without ſo much ado as you have made about it.</p>
               <p>And while all the Maſters were thus controverſing the Solution of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> in the hearing of the Artiſt that made it, and when they had all ſpent their philoſophizing upon it, the Artiſt that made this Engin, and all this while liſtened to their admirable Fancies, tells them, Gentlemen, you have diſcovered very much excellency of Invention touching this piece of Work that is before you, but you are all miſerably miſtaken, for it was I that made this Watch, and brought it hither; and I will ſhew you how I made it; firſt, I wrought the Spring, and the Fuſee, and the Wheels, and the Ballance, and the Caſe, and Table; I fitted them one to another, and placed theſe ſeveral Axes that are to direct the Motions of the Index to diſcover the Hour of the Day, of the Figure that diſcovers the <hi>Phaſis</hi> of the Moon, and the other various Motions that you ſee; and then I put it together, and wound up the Spring, which hath given all theſe Motions that to ſee in this curious piece of Work: and that you may be ſure I tell you true, I will tell you the whole order and progreſs of my making, diſpoſing, and ordering of this piece of Work, the ſeveral materials of it, the manner of the forming of every individual part of it, and how long I was about it: This plain and evident diſcovery renders all theſe excogitated <hi>Hypotheſes</hi>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:64147:176"/>
of theſe Philoſophical Enthuſiaſts vain and ridiculous, without any great help of Rhetorical Flouriſhes or Logical Confutations.</p>
               <p>And much of the ſame nature is that diſparity of the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the Learned Philoſophers in relation to the Origination of the World and Man, after a great deal of duſt raiſed, and fanciful Explications and unintelligible <hi>Hypotheſes.</hi> The plain, but Divine Narrative by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> full of ſence, and congruity, and clearneſs, and reaſonableneſs in it ſelf, doth at the ſame moment give us a true and clear diſcovery of this great Myſtery, and renders all the Eſſays of the generality of the Heathen Philoſophers to be vain, inevident, and indeed inexplicable Theories, the creatures of Phantaſie and Imagination, and nothing elſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This therefore is the firſt Advantage of the <hi>Moſaical Hypotheſis</hi> of the Origination of things above the Philoſophical Theories touching the ſame; the latter are inevident, conjectural, and indeed apparently falſe; the former contains an Evidence of it ſelf, by its conſonancy, to the only manner that can be ſufficient for ſuch a Diſcovery, and the plain, evident; and congruous relation of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the Philoſophical Theories (except that which carries the Origination of things up to Almighty God) are full of infinite intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, difficulties, and inconſiſtencies, that ever and anon break out and diſcover themſelves; whereby they are enforced by a continual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of new Suppoſitions, to piece up and mend the breaches that ariſe upon ſuch inconſiſtencies, and ſo avoid thoſe intollerable abſurdities that their Suppoſitions do neceſſarily occaſion. And again, ſometime are fain utterly to lay aſide ſome of their former Poſitions, as utterly undiſciplinable and ungovernable by any ſubſidiary Explication, by reaſon of their groſs abſurdities and apparent impoſſibilities. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by ſome of the former Debates touching the <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Aristote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Suppoſitions, and many more may be given in this matter.</p>
               <p>But the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as it is perfectly conſonant to it ſelf, ſo it labours under no difficulties or abſurdities, but all parts thereof are eaſily and apparently reconcilable one with another, and with the common reaſon of the things delivered upon the account of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Suppoſition upon which the whole is bottomed, namely, the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the moſt Wiſe and Powerful Intelligent Being.</p>
               <p>Since therefore it is evident that Truth is ever conſiſtent with it ſelf, and that which contains any irreconcilable abſurdity or contradiction with it ſelf or any other Truth, can never be true: we have all the reaſon imaginable to give the preference to the <hi>Moſaical Hypotheſis,</hi> as conſonant to it ſelf, and to all other Truths that are; and on the other ſide, to reject the <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Theories in this matter, each of which contains irreconcilable difficulties in themſelves, and contradictions to evident and demoſtrable Truths.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third obſervable is this, That the Holy Hiſtory gives us ſuch an Efficient, and ſuch an Efficiency of things that gives us a plain, and clear, and evident Solution of all thoſe admirable <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that we ſee both in the Univerſe, in the Motions, Orders, Poſitions, Influences, and Conveniences of the whole Univerſe, and of the ſeveral great Integrals thereof, and likewiſe of that admirable Beauty, Order, Symmetry, Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:64147:176"/>
of Parts, and Organs of Faculties and Powers that are to be found in Animals, and eſpecially in Man: of theſe admirable congruities of Powers, Motions, and Inſtincts not only in the Animal and Vegetable Province, but alſo in the very inanimate Bodies; by giving us the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, moſt Wiſe, moſt Bountiful God to be the firſt Author of the World and of Mankind, and to be the Contriver and Inſtitutor of that Law in things created, which we uſually call the Law of their Nature, which is nothing elſe but the Will, the Rule, the Inſtitution of the moſt Wiſe, Powerful, and Intelligent Being. And let Men toyl themſelves till their Brains be fired, and ſtudy and invent from Age to Age, to give us any other Explication of moſt of the obſervable <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> in Nature, they will toyl in vain, and ſubſtitute unto us nothing but empty, watriſh, and unſatisfactory Solutions, or meer Whimſies, <hi>Chimaera</hi>'s, and Falſities, inſtead of Truth and Reality: And this is the admirable preference of the Divine Hiſtory of the Origination of Things, that it gives us a ſolid, plain, evident, congruous Solution of all the admirable <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in univerſal and particular Beings, wherein our Minds may reſt, and quiet themſelves; which thoſe Philoſophers neither do nor can do, that uſe any other Method of the Origination of Things. What reaſon can there be aſſigned of the poſition of the Elementary and Heavenly Bodies in that moſt convenient poſition and ſituation, the uſefulneſs, order, and regularity of their Motions, Heat, and Influence? Why the Motions of every thing are directed with the moſt ſuitableneſs to the convenience of the Univerſe, and to its own? Why a Stone or a Bar of Iron moves downward, what is within it, or without it, that excites or directs it? What reaſon can there be aſſigned of that admirable accommodation of Meteors, the Wind and Rain, nay the very Thunder and Lightning, to the uſe and benefit of the Elementary World? What reaſon can be aſſigned of the admirable Fabrick of the Body of Man, that ſingular beauty, deſtination, and ſymmetry, and convenience of Parts and Organs, that admirable conſtitution and ordination of his Faculties, eſpecially that of his Intellect? What reaſon can be aſſigned of the wonderful order and procedure of the generation of Men, yea and of common Animals: All done with that order and uniformity, with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and regularity, that it exceeds the imitation, and even the the comprehenſion of the wiſeſt Man in the World? Touching theſe and infinite more of theſe admirable Appearances in Nature, the firſt of <hi>Geneſis</hi> gives us a plain, reaſonable, evident Explication, by letting us know that theſe were the Works of the moſt Intelligent Being, the Works of the moſt Wiſe and Glorious God: And the reaſon why they are ſo admirably, wiſely, and excellently framed and ordered, is becauſe they were made and ordered by the great Skill, Wiſdom, Power, and Deſign of the Glorious God.</p>
               <p>But now if we come to demand of theſe wiſe Philoſophers a Solution of the admirableneſs of theſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> we ſhall have ſuch Solutions as muſt make us firſt unreaſon and unman our ſelves, before we can ſubſcribe to them, or at leaſt we ſhall have ſuch a Solution as no way countervails the value of the Work, or elſe ſhall give a Solution of <hi>Idem per idem,</hi> or elſe by ſomewhat elſe that is utterly unintelligible.</p>
               <p>Ask <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and by their favour, ſome of their late
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:64147:177"/>
the Atomiſts will tell us, that all or the greateſt part of this is by chance, caſual poſition, and mode, and motion, and figure, and texture of Atoms: and he that believes this whiles he hears it or ſays it, is in a full capacity of believing any thing, though never ſo unreaſonable. Let any Man but ask his own Reaſon fairly, whether he can believe this that he thus ſaith, I appeal to that Man, whether he doth or can really believe himſelf when he ſays it. Ask another ſort of Philoſophers for their Solution of it, they will tell you that Nature is the Cauſe, and a ſufficient Solution of all theſe things: But what is that Nature, where is it, is it the nature or diſpoſition of the things themſelves? Then it explicates it no otherwiſe but thus, That things have this excellency and order, becauſe it is their nature to be ſo, or, they are ſo becauſe they are ſo: But if by Nature they mean ſome ſeparate Exiſtence, what then is it? Is it a Body or Spirit, is it a reaſonable, an intelligent Being, or is it a ſurd and ſtupid Exiſtence, or elſe is it a Law or a Rule ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſiſting? If it be a reaſonable, intelligent Exiſtence, we differ but only <hi>de nomine;</hi> that which I call God they will call Nature, at leaſt unleſs they ſuppoſe it an inferior intelligent Being, and then the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is only made ſomewhat more; that a ſubordinate intelligent Being was able to produce ſuch Effects which appear to all Men to be Works of the greateſt Power, and Wiſdom imaginable. On the other ſide, if they ſuppoſe it to be a meer ſurd unintelligent Being, how comes it to paſs that they carry in them the greateſt evidence imaginable of the moſt perfect, and conſequently of the moſt intelligent efficient Agent? Again, will they ſuppoſe it a <hi>Norma,</hi> Rule, or Law of a moſt excellent frame and order, (and indeed in ſo conceiving, they conceive truly that Nature is ſuch a Law or Rule) but ſtill this doth not explicate the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of Nature, without ſuppoſing ſomewhat more: A Law or Rule is not in it ſelf effective or active, neither can it ſubſiſt or exiſt without an Agent that either gave it, or works by or according to it. The Laws of a State are the Rules of its Government, but this Law muſt be given by ſome Power, and ſome Power there muſt be that muſt act according to it, otherwiſe a Law is a ſtupid, dead, unactive, and unconceivable thing: And therefore a Law or Rule ſingly explicates not any the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of Nature without a Being that gives this Law to things, or acts, or makes things act according to it; and then we are in a great meaſure where <hi>Moſes</hi> brings us, only with this difference, the Law by which this great World was made, was no other but the Determination and <hi>Beneplacitum</hi> of the Divine Will, determined or qualified (if we may uſe that improper word) with the higheſt and moſt ſovereign Wiſdom and Power: And the Law by which things thus made were for the future to be governed, was that inſtituted Rule and Order which this Sovereign Lord contrived and placed in created Beings; and thus indeed, <hi>Opus naturae eſt opus intelligentiae.</hi> Nature therefore may have theſe various acceptations, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As it ſignifies that <hi>Principium activum</hi> that gave every thing its Being; and thus it imports no other than Almighty God, that Supreme Intelligent Being, though improperly called Nature; <hi>viz. Natura na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As it imports the Things or Effects principated or effected by this
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:64147:177"/>
intelligent active Principle, or the Effects or Creatures of God, or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura naturata,</hi> and this hath a double import, <hi>viz.</hi> i. For the firſt and immediate Productions of that Principle, namely, not only created Matter, which was the <hi>Productum primo primum,</hi> but alſo the things firſt produced in their ſeveral kinds or natures, or <hi>Producta ſecundo prima,</hi> as the firſt Vegetable, Animal, and Humane Individuals: or 2. For thoſe Mixtions and Productions which afterwards had their productions in the World by ſucceſſive mixtions and generations, which include all Productions, which though in relation to their dependence and firſt production of their kind, are ſtill the Creatures of God; yet in relation to their immediate Cauſes, are productions of ſecond Cauſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As it imports the Law and Rule and Method and Order, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and government and proceſs of created Beings; and this of two kinds, 1. The Law and Rule of the firſt Creation or Production of Beings; as the production of the firſt Individuals of Animals, Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Men: and herein though Almighty God proceeds with admirable Wiſdom and Order, yet he uſed no other Law or Rule than the immediate Determination of his own moſt wiſe and perfect Will, ſuitable to the Buſineſs he had in hand, wherein there was neceſſary and fit another kind of Regiment and Order than was afterwards inſtituted. 2. The Laws or Rules inſtituted and appointed by the ſame moſt wiſe God to things already conſtituted; this is the common and ordinary and regular Law of inſtituted Nature: and theſe two Laws or Rules were different, and neceſſary that they ſhould be ſo. In the firſt Conſtitutions of Beings God Almighty proceeded by a Law ſuitable to that Work, namely, according to the wiſe Counſel of his own Will, that was beſt and fitteſt for that Work; he proceeded more ſuddenly, and by the immediate interpoſition of his own Power the Vegetables conſtituted in a moment, or very ſpeedily, and within the compaſs of a Day came to their full and perfect maturation and growth: ſo alſo did the Fowls, and Fiſhes, and Brutes, and Man, without any conſiderable <hi>mora</hi> between their firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and complement or individual perfection: But the Law inſtituted for things already formed and ſetled was of another kind; Vegetables, Animals, and Men are in the Laws of their future exiſtence to paſs through thoſe gradations and ſteps and methods which we ſee now in uſe, for the formation, production, increaſe, and perfection thereof. Again, in the firſt production of things, though ſometimes the wiſe God uſed in ſome meaſure the order of ſecond or inſtrumental or effective Cauſes, yet he bound not himſelf to that Rule; though, as we have formerly obſerved, the inſtrumentality of Heat might be uſed in ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the <hi>Expanſum,</hi> and the arefaction of the Earth, and the production of Vegetables; and though the inſtrumentality of the perfected Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Bodies might be ſome way inſtrumental towards the maturation of Nature, towards the production of Animals: and though he uſed the Matter which he had created to be the <hi>ſubſtratum</hi> of the Corporeal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, even of Man himſelf; yet the great Energy and Power whereby he compleated all things, was above and beyond the activity of ſecond Cauſes; yea when he uſed the inſtrumentality of ſecond Cauſes, his own Powerful and Omnipotent Hand was engaged in the advancing of the efficacy of the ſecond Cauſes, which he uſed beyond their natural
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:64147:178"/>
ſtrength and efficacy, there was much that was ſupernatural and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, as well in the firſt ſeparation, diſtribution, and formation of things, as in the firſt Creation of the Corporeal Matter out of nothing. But in the ſucceeding proceſs and procedure of created Nature he fixed and eſtabliſhed certain powers and activities in things, and a certain order and connexion between them and their effects, and governed and regulated the motions and productions of things according to thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted powers and connexions; and this we call the inſtituted Law of Nature, namely, the activities and powers placed in created Beings, and the mutual connexions and concatenations of things to ſuch activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers: which Law was at firſt inſtituted by the God of Nature to be the common and ſtanding ordinary Rule for things, ſetled and fixed in their created ſtation. And therefore we are far from denying a Law of Nature or Calling in the immediate efficiency of the great God, or a miraculous interpoſition in all the ordinary procedures of things already fully ſetled and ſtatuminated by the firſt Divine Efficiency. That which we only ſay in relation to Nature already ſetled is but this, that 1. The primitive and fundamental powers and activities of things were placed in them by the immediate Will and Efficiency of God; it is this that gives the power to Heat and Fire to diſſolve, diſſipate, rarifie, and conſume; to Cold to condenſe; to heavy Bodies to deſcend; to all the Celeſtial Bodies their Motions, Influences, and Poſitions; that gave the Generative Faculty to Men, to Brutes, to Fiſhes; the Productive Faculty to the Earth and Waters; the Receptivity to <hi>Semen</hi> and Intellection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. That he by a continuing Influx doth ſupport and preſerve all things in their being, order, and activity. 3. That this which we call the Law of inſtituted and ſtatuminated Nature, is his Law and his Inſtitution, and the connexion of natural Effects to their natural Cauſes is his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, his Law, his Order.</p>
               <p>And therefore we do neither deny a Law of Nature, or a connexion between natural Cauſes and Effects, but that which we juſtly blame in theſe Men that pretend themſelves to be the great Prieſts of Nature, and admirers and adorers of it, is, 1. That they do not ſufficiently conſider and obſerve, that this which they and we call Nature, and the Law of Nature, and the Power of Nature, is no other but the wiſe inſtituted Law of the moſt wiſe, powerful, and intelligent Being, as really and truly as an Edict of <hi>Trajan</hi> or <hi>Juſtinian</hi> was a Law of <hi>Trajan</hi> or <hi>Juſtinian; Sic parvis magna:</hi> and 2. That they do not warily diſtinguiſh between that firſt Law, <hi>in rebus conſtituendis;</hi> and this ſecond Law of Nature, <hi>in rebus conſtitutis;</hi> but inconſiderately miſapply that Law and Rule and Method which is ordinary and regular, conſtituted, and fitted, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to Nature already ſetled; as if the ſame were and ought to be neceſſarily the Rule and Law in the firſt formation and ſetling of things: which is an Errour that proceeds from the over-much fixing of our Minds to that which in the preſent courſe of things is obvious to Senſe, and not adverting, that the firſt Conſtitution and Order of things is not in Reaſon or Nature manageable by ſuch a Law, which is moſt excellently adequated and proportioned to things fully ſetled.</p>
               <p>Therefore, beſides that Law which the Divine Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs hath fixed in Nature fully ſtatuminated, we muſt alſo ſuppoſe a
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:64147:178"/>
Law and Order of the Divine Wiſdom, not rigorouſly bound either to ſecond Cauſes or preſent ſtated Methods in the firſt production of things. And this the due Conſideration of the different nature of the ſtate of things <hi>in fieri</hi> and <hi>in facto eſſe,</hi> will eaſily perſwade, that the moſt wiſe God that hath eſtabliſhed a fixed, regular, ordinary Law in things already ſetled, which he rarely departs from; yet uſed another kind of order, namely, the regiment of his own Will and Wiſdom, and if I may with humility ſpeak it, a dictatorian power, more accommodate to the firſt production of things. And thus much for the compariſon between the <hi>Moſaical</hi> and Philoſophical Theories touching things, and the great advantage and preference of the former, as moſt ſuitable to the true nature, ſtate, and reaſon of things. And now I draw towards a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this long Diſcourſe, and ſhall therefore in the laſt place give an account of thoſe Conſectaries, Conſequences, and Corollaries which are evidently deducible from this Conſideration of the Origination of Mankind by the immediate Efficiency of this Supreme Intelligent Being, Almighty God: and indeed, principally for the ſake of theſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and Corollaries hath all been written that precedes in this Book, and it is the Scope, End, and Uſe of the whole Book, which I ſhall abſolve in the next Chapter.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CAP. VII.</hi> A Collection of certain evident and profitable Conſequences from this Conſideration, That the firſt Individuals of Humane Nature had their Original from a Great, Powerful, Wiſe, Intelligent Being.</head>
               <p>I Now come to that upon which I had my Eye from the firſt Line that was written touching this Subject, namely, the Conſequences and Illations that ariſe from this great Truth contained in theſe Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Mankind had an Original of his Being <hi>ex non genitis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Origination of Mankind was neither caſual, nor meerly natural.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Efficient of Man's Origination, was and is an Intelligent Efficient of an incomparable Wiſdom and Power.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, we have here a moſt evident, ſenſible, and clear conviction of a Deity, and a confirmation of Natural Religion, which conſiſts principally in the acknowledging of Almighty God to be a moſt perfect Eternal Being, of infinite Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Power, and a due habitude of Mind, Life, and Practice, ariſing from that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
               <p>It hath been commonly obſerved, that the particular or inſtituted Religions ſince the Creation have had their Proofs by Miracles, which were as it were the Credentials to ſubdue the Minds of Men to aſſent to it. Thus the inſtituted Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> given by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was confirmed by the great Miracles done by God by the hand
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:64147:179"/>
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> and in the Wilderneſs: and the Chriſtian Religion had its Confirmation by the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who did wonderful things, beyond the reach and power of created Agents or Activities, which were therefore Miracles; ſuch as were governing of the Winds and Seas, healing of the Sick by a touch or word, raiſing the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is farther ſaid, That Almighty God never uſed Miracles to evidence the truth of his own Exiſtence, Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs; or for the eſtabliſhing of Natural Religion, or the confuting of Atheiſm.</p>
               <p>But I take it, that there are really as many Miracles for the evincing of the truth of Natural Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Exiſting of Almighty God, as there are Works in Nature: For although it be a great truth, that the Laws of Nature, as the Poſitions of the Heavenly and Elementary Bodies, their Motion, Light, Influence, Regularity, Poſition, propagation of Vegetables, Animals, Men, and the whole Oeconomy of the Univerſe is by the Divine Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs ſetled in a regular courſe; ſo that now we call things Natural, and Works and Laws and Order of Nature; and being ſo ſetled and fixed, ceaſe to be Miracles: yet in their firſt Inſtitution and Conſtitution, they were all, or many, Miracles, Works exceeding the activity of any created or natural power, and accordingly ought to be valued, and really are ſo; and it is nothing elſe but their commonneſs, and our inadvertence and groſs negligence, that hinders the actual eſtimate of them as great and wonderful Miracles: As I have often ſaid, if at this moment all the Motions of the Heavenly Bodies ſhould ceaſe, or there ſhould be a general ſtop of the Propagation of Animals, Vegetables, or Men, if Mens Reaſon ſhould generally fail them, and for the moſt part they ſhould become like Brutes, if the Light of the Sun were darkned, or the great Luminous or Planetary Bodies ſhould bulge and fall foul one upon the other, or that diſorder or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion ſhould generally fall upon the Works of Nature, and break that excellent Order that now obtains among them, we ſhould be full of admiration of ſuch a Change, and account them Miraculous: And the reaſon is, becauſe the ſenſe of the Change is at preſent incumbent upon us, and we cannot chooſe but take notice of them as ſtrong, unuſual, miraculous Prodigies: When all this while Natures courſe holds regularly, the Wonder and Miracle is ten times greater in the ſtate of things as they now ſtand, than it would be in ſuch a diſcompoſure of Nature. The Motion, and Light, and Poſition, and Order of the Heavenly and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Bodies is a greater Evidence of the Divine Power that put them and keeps them in Motion, than if they all reſted. And it is a greater Miracle that a Man was conſtituted upon the Earth, that he hath a power given him to propagate his kind, that he lives ordinarily ſuch a portion of time in the World, that he hath the uſe of Reaſon and Underſtanding; I ſay there is more of Miracle in it, than in the want of it: Only there are theſe three things that abate the value of it among Men, 1. The commonneſs of the benefit and wonder renders the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation thereof little. 2. Mankind is negligent in improving his Obſervation, he never rubs the Corn out of the Ear, and ſo by inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, ſupineneſs, and negligence, ſuffers things of this nature to ſlip away without notice. 3. We rarely carry things to their Original, but
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64147:179"/>
take them as we find them; whereas if we did as by a Clew follow the Works of Nature to their Original, we ſhould find the Divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and infinite Wiſdom at the upper end of the Chain, and the Worms themſelves no other than Miracles in their firſt conſtitution. He that conſiders the admirableneſs of the Frame of Humane Nature, eſpecially of his intellectual power, and that is but acquainted with himſelf, will without arrogance or vain-glory conclude that Man is the moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Creature that this lower World affords, a Creature to which all the viſible Creatures of this lower World ſeem in a great meaſure to point at, as their End. And therefore if the firſt Individuals, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Parents of Mankind were at ſome one time conſtituted, there was a very great deal of Power, Wiſdom, and Intelligence employed to the making up of ſuch a Piece as this: If we ſee an excellent Picture to the Life, or a Statue, there will not need much Rhetorick or Logick to perſwade or evince, that ſurely it was not done without an excellent, knowing, and intelligent Artiſt. And certainly that Efficient, who ever he was that did at firſt compoſe and make up the admirable Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Humane Body, all the Organs, Nerves, Veins, Arteries, <hi>Viſcera,</hi> Bones and other Integrals thereof; that endowed it with the Faculties of a vegetable and ſenſible Nature, that gave him a reaſonable, intellectual ſelf-moving Soul, with all its ſubordinate Faculties; that ſo ſtrangely and ſtupendiouſly united two ſuch different Eſſentials of a reciprocal and intellectual nature, was ſome intelligent Being, and ſuch an intelligent Being that was not only of a far more admirable Wiſdom and Power than Man, now the beſt of the viſible Creatures, appears to be; but of ſuch an exceſs of Wiſdom and Power, as cannot be found in any known Being, beſides him that we call Almighty God.</p>
               <p>And if any Man ſhall ſay, as needs he muſt, that ſurely it muſt be granted, that he was of a Power and Wiſdom far more excellent and perfect than that Work he thus made; but how are we ſure that he muſt be God? May it not be ſome Being that admirably ſurpaſſeth the perfection of Humane Nature, and yet may it not be ſomething leſs than infinite, ſomewhat inferior to God, may it not be ſome Angel, ſome ſeparated Intelligence? To this I ſay, 1. That Man that can be forced by this Work to acknowledge an Intelligent Being tranſcendently beyond the Power and Wiſdom of a Man, a Power that he never ſaw, but only collected from the eminence of an Effect which ſurpaſſeth the activity of any Being that he hath ever ſeen with his Eyes; a Being that acts by choice, election, and intention: I ſay, that Man that can once admit an inviſible Being of an efficiency equal to ſuch a Work, hath broken the ſtrength of Atheiſm; ſince whatſoever can be alledged to evince ſuch an Exiſtence, as the Objection ſuppoſed doth, may be alledged efficaciouſly to prove the Exiſtence of a God; ſince all that can be ſaid for the Exiſtence of the former, that and much more may and muſt be ſaid and granted for the Exiſtence of the latter, namely, God. 2. But again, ſince the meaſure of any Man's conception touching, the infinite, ſovereign ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of an Efficient muſt needs be the excellence of the Work; if therefore a Man doth not, cannot know any more admirable created Exiſtence than himſelf, he cannot expect a greater Evidence of a more tranſcendent Power, Wiſdom, or Goodneſs, than he that was the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:64147:180"/>
Efficient of ſuch a Being as himſelf is: 'Tis poſſible he may ſuppoſe ſome more excellent Inhabitants of the Heavenly Bodies than he himſelf is, but this is more than he knows; and 'tis true the Sun and Stars are goodly beautiful Bodies, but he doth not know that they are any more than fiery Balls, that naturally give light and heat: but as he hath no evidence, ſo he hath no evident reaſon to ſatisfie, that they are animate, much leſs intellectual; and conſequently, for any thing a Man knows he himſelf is incomparably a more excellent Being than they: it is true, they laſt longer, and ſo doth a piece of Marble, I ſpeak not to diſparage thoſe beautiful Beings, but to enforce the Argument <hi>ad hominem;</hi> that to the firſt formation of a living Intelligent Nature there is as great a Power requiſite and conſpicuous, as to the formation of the nobleſt Creature that we ſee or know: And I ſhould not queſtion, but that that Power and Wiſdom which were equal to the firſt formation of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Nature, were equal to the formation and efficiency of the Sun or the brighteſt Star in Heaven. Since therefore I can judge of the meaſure or exceſs of the Power and Wiſdom of any Efficient by the nobleneſs and value of the Effect, and I know not any ſenſible Being of greater worth, value, and wonder than Man; I have reaſon to believe that he that firſt formed Man is a Being of the greateſt and moſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs that is imaginable; and that Being which I have reaſon to believe to be of the greateſt Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs, I have reaſon to believe to be Almighty God, who is <hi>Optimus Maximus.</hi> And if it be ſaid that the conviction by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo much the more infirm, becauſe I ſee daily that Man begets a Man, and ſo the efficiency no more proves the Exiſtence of God, than it proves the Father to be God that begets a Son of his own likeneſs and <hi>ſpecies;</hi> I ſay the Inſtance is ſo far from weakning the Inference, that it rather enforceth it: For the firſt formed Parents of Mankind were alſo endued with this generative power, by virtue of that firſt efficiency upon the firſt individual pair of Mankind; ſo that the generative power in Man is but an effect of that redundance of Power that was in the firſt Efficient of the Humane Nature: Indeed if any Man, or all the Men in the World could conſtitute a Man in any other way than by natural propagation, it were an Inſtance that would ſufficiently confute the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. But the generative power and faculty being but a part of that admirable effect that was wrought in the formation of the Humane Nature, it rather advanceth, than any way depreciateth the Power and Wiſdom of the firſt Efficient of Mankind, that he was formed together with ſuch a power of propagating his kind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From hence we learn not only that there is a God, but in ſome meaſure we learn what he is. As this Work, the primitive Effection of the Humane Nature, could never be effected but by an Intelligent Being, ſo when we ſee ſuch a Work as this, we cannot chooſe but acknowledge that he is tranſcendently wiſe, tranſcendently powerful, tranſcendently good; that ſuch was his Power and Wiſdom, appears by his Work, and that ſuch was his Goodneſs, appears, in that freely without any motive or advantage to himſelf he formed this excellent creature Man; it was but to communicate his abundant Goodneſs, and to give Being to an Intelligent Nature that might be capable of the participation of his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64147:180"/>
Goodneſs and Bounty commenſurate to his nature. We alſo learn, that as he made an Intelligent Being, ſo he is a Tranſcendent Intelligence; <hi>He that made the Eye, ſhall he not ſee?</hi> It is very true, the perception of Senſe is the loweſt kind of perception, and the perception of rational and diſcurſive Intellection is of a higher rank than the perception of Senſe; the Intuitive perception is nobler than that of Ratiocination; but the perception, if I may uſe that word, in Almighty God is of a tranſcendent perfection above all theſe, and includeth them all, but not under thoſe allayes that render other kind of perceptions leſs perfect: He ſees and hears and knows, without an Eye, without an Ear, without an Object. He that could create an Intellectual Being, doth moſt perfectly underſtand and know, for he could not be deſtitute of any perfection whereof an incorporeal Being could be capable; and ſince he made a Being capable of Intelligence, certainly he had a greater and more perfect Intelligence. And here I cannot chooſe but re-mind ſome things again that I have formerly intimated, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That thoſe that go about to attribute the Origination of Mankind to a bare Order or Law of Nature, as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Effector thereof, ſpeak that which is perfectly irrational and unintelligible: for although a Law or Rule is the Method and Order by which an Intelligent Being may act, yet a Law or Rule or Order is a dead, unactive, uneffective thing of it ſelf, without an Agent that uſeth it, and exerciſeth it as his Rule and Method of Action. What would a Law ſignifie in a Kingdom or State, unleſs there were ſome Perſon or Society of Men that did exerciſe, and execute, and judge, and determin, and act by it, or according to it? And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the Books <hi>de Mundo</hi> attributed to him, though in the deſcription of God, as to the conſtancy of his working, he ſtile him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Lex aequabiliter in nos fuſa, nec tranſpoſitionem nec correctionem ullam recipiens, praestantior &amp; firmior omnibus quae in tabulis deſcriptae contineantur.</hi> Yet he reſts not in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, but tells us that he is a Being, that acts by Empire and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Will: <hi>Quod in navi guhernator, in curru auriga, in choro praecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in civitate lex, in exercitu imperator, hoc idem in mundo Deus.</hi> So that to the effecting of the Humane Nature a bare independent Law is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent, but there muſt be an Intelligent Being, whoſe Will that Rule and Law which we call Nature is. 2. That although the Manner and Method that the Divine Power and Wiſdom uſed in the firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and effecting of the Humane Nature, is not cognoſcible by the Light of Nature, without Divine Revelation, becauſe none but Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God was acquainted with or preſent at that Work, and his Power and Wiſdom might uſe various Orders or Methods in its firſt effection: yet the Concluſion, that this Work, whatever particular Method it had for its effection, was the Work of a moſt powerful, intelligent, wiſe Being, acting by Intellection, Will, and Intention, is a Truth apparently evident to the Light of Nature and Reaſon, and as infallible a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of a Deity, as if a Man could have been preſent and ſeen the Work done; as I do moſt rationally conclude an excellent Watch or other <hi>Automaton</hi> was the work of an intelligent Artiſt, though I do not know the particular manner how he made it, unleſs I am particularly informed thereof by him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From hence we learn, that the Divine Providence extends to this
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:64147:181"/>
lower World and all the things therein, and is not only confined to things above the Moon, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have it.</p>
               <p>He that condeſcended to the effection not only of Man, but of all the Animals of this lower World, certainly had a regard to them, and would not leave them without the regiment of his Providence, which were the Works of his own immediate Power and Will.</p>
               <p>It is true, the ordinary regiment of the Divine Providence in things natural is ordinarily managed by this regular and ordinary Law of Nature whereof we have ſpoken before. But yet he deals not by the World, as I deal by my Watch; when I have wound it up I take no more care of it, but it moves according to the regular compoſure of it; but he communicates a general Influence to it, whereby it is ſupported in its Being and Order; and as he manifeſted a more ſpecial care in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioning of Man, ſo he affords him a ſpecial Providence in his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From hence we learn, not only the Original of thoſe admirable Faculties in Man, eſpecially of the light of his Underſtanding and the liberty of his Will, whereby he reſembles his Maker; but alſo from whence he had that Intellectual Soul, not out of the Matter whereof his Corporeal and Animal Nature was conſtituted, but of a higher and nobler extraction, namely, by Creation he breathed into him the breath of Life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From hence we learn to be confirmed not only in the Notion of the Immortality of the Soul, but in ſome meaſure the reaſon of it: It was a created Spiritual Nature, infuſed into him by the Almighty effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and infuſion of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. From hence we learn, that Mankind is of kin to both Worlds, the Celeſtial and Elementary, <hi>nexus utriuſque mundi,</hi> capable of a felicity beyond the extent of this inferior World.</p>
               <p n="7">7. From hence we alſo learn from whence theſe common Notions, eſpecially of the Exiſtence of a God, and theſe anticipations of ſome Moral Principles of the Veneration of God, Righteouſneſs, and Juſtice are evidently to be found in the generality of Mankind; (but where they are impaired by corrupt Cuſtoms or Education) from whence thoſe Operations of the natural Conſcience are diſcernible in moſt Men ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to any Inſtruction or Education, the original of thoſe common Notions that more immediately concern the Intellective Faculty, and Moral Inclinations that more immediately concern the Volitive Faculty, ſeem to be two; the firſt more primitive and radical in the Soul, the ſecond not altogether ſo radical and primitive, yet ſuch as have alſo a natural connexion with and to the Soul. Firſt therefore as to the firſt of theſe: The Soul of Man, as it came out of the hands of the Glorious God, ſo it had engraven in it theſe Impreſſions and Characters of ſome great and intellective Principles and rational Propenſions, that ſerve ſecretly to direct and incline him to theſe common Notions and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So that whether the Souls of the Deſcendents from <hi>Adam</hi> were traduced from him, or whether they are immediately crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and infuſed by God, (a Diſpute not ſeaſonable in this place) yet thoſe real Characters, Impreſſions, and rational <hi>Noemata</hi> and Inſtincts (though weakned by the Fall, and the contracted Corruption of Humane
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:64147:181"/>
Nature) are brought with us into the World, and grow up with us; whereby Mankind hath not only thoſe great excellencies of his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Underſtanding and Will, but a certain congenit ſtock of Rational Tendencies and Sentiments engraven and lodged in his Soul, which if duly attended and improved, are admirable helps to the perfecting and advancing of a Rational Life. And therefore, as the Divine Goodneſs did not only give the Faculties of Senſe and Perception to the Senſitive and Animal Nature, but alſo lodged in their ſenſitive Souls certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and congenit ſenſitive Inſtincts (not acquired by Experience, but congenit with them) whereby they are directed and inclined to what is conducible to the ſenſitive good of their Senſitive Nature; ſo the Rational Nature is furniſhed with certain congenit Notions, Inclinations, and Tendencies born with him, but improved and perfected by the exerciſe of Reaſon and Obſervation, whereby he is inclined and directed antecedently to the good of a Reaſonable Life or Nature.</p>
               <p>Theſe differences ſeem to be in thoſe congenit Inclinations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts of Animals and Men, 1. In the nature of them, thoſe antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations that are in Animals are meerly ſenſible; thoſe in Men intellectual, moral, and ſuitable to the Operations of a reaſonable Being. 2. In their end, thoſe of Animals are only in order to a ſenſible good, and the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſenſual Life; thoſe in Men are directed to the uſe and benefit of a rational Life, and not only ſo, but in order to the acqueſt of a ſupernatural and eternal Life. 3. In as much as the Senſible Nature is not endued with Intellection and Will, and therefore not properly capable of a Law in the true and formal nature of a Law; therefore thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts that are lodged in their nature, are meerly Inclinations, or natural Propenſions, or Biaſſes; But the Humane Nature being endued with Intellection, Reaſon, and Liberty, and therefore capable of a Law in its true propriety and formal nature; thoſe rational Propenſions and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in the Humane Nature, are lodged in him by the great Governour and Law-giver of Heaven and Earth, <hi>per modum legis obligantis;</hi> and the inſition and engraving of thoſe Notions, Propenſions, and rational Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies are in nature of a promulgation of that Law, the inſcription thereof in their Hearts, and means, helps, and aſſiſtances to their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance thereof. And herein lies the true Root of the Obligation of the natural Law and natural Conſciences, ſo excellently decyphered by the Apoſtle in the two firſt Chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and this I call the primitive and radical Inſition of the Law of Nature in the Soul. 2. But beſides this primitive Inſition, there is a ſecondary yet natural Inſition of the Law of Nature in the humane Soul, which expands and improves it ſelf as the exerciſe of Reaſon increaſeth; which is a certain congruity between the Faculties of the Soul, the Intellect and Will, and thoſe Truths of indiſputable importance in the Underſtanding, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of the Exiſtence and Regiment of Almighty God, and thoſe moral Sentiments of Good and Evil that in their diſcovery concern immediately the Underſtanding or <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> but in their exerciſe concern more immediately the Will: That as we ſee by a certain connatural congruity between the viſive Faculty and the viſible Object, and as we taſt by a connatural congruity between the Faculty and the Object of Taſt; ſo there is a connatural congruity between the intellective and volitive
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:64147:182"/>
Faculties in the Soul, and thoſe <hi>communia noemata</hi> of theſe great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truths both intellective and moral, whereby the Soul perceives, and reliſheth, and taſteth true and good, and inclines to it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. From the Conſideration of this Effection of Man by the Power and Goodneſs and Wiſdom of the glorious God, we have the diſcovery of that infinite obligation of Duty, Love, and Gratitude of all Mankind unto Almighty God. To give a benefit to a Being already exiſting, carries in it an Obligation of the perſon benefited to his Benefactor, <hi>juxta modum &amp; menſuram beneficii.</hi> But God Almighty is the Benefactor of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the greateſt imaginable amplitude and comprehenſion: he gave him Being, the vaſteſt and moſt unlimited Gift, and he gave him ſuch a Being, ſo advanced, ſo excellent, and perfect, and accommodate with all the conveniences that his nature was poſſibly capable of; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Man wilfully threw away a great meaſure of his Happineſs, yet he hath ſtill ſo much left as binds him to an eternal Gratitude and Duty to God, both as his Maker and as his Benefactor: and the Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> hath ſtill continued upon them the ſame reaſon of Duty and Gratitude: I ſhall not here, as I ſaid, enter into the Conſideration of the propagation of the Humane Nature. If the Soul of every perſon propagated be created and infuſed by God, then every perſon ſeems related unto Almighty God in a way little different from that of the firſt formed Man: But if the Soul be alſo propagated as Light or Fire from Fire or Light, by a kind of Irradiation from the Soul of the firſt Man, yet ſtill we are all his Off-ſpring, every Man owes more of his Being to Almighty God than to his natural Parents, whoſe very Propagative Faculty was at firſt given to the Humane Nature by the only virtue, efficacy, and energy of the Divine Commiſſion and Inſtitution, and the Parents of our Nature are but <hi>vicaria inſtrumenta Numinis,</hi> in the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and formation of our Nature.</p>
               <p n="9">9. From hence we learn the true Foundation, and Root, and Extent of that Subjection that the Created Nature owes to Almighty God, namely, on the part of Man there is dependence upon God, as the root and ſupport of his exiſtence, there is the obligation of love, gratitude, and duty, as to his greateſt and moſt ſovereign Benefactor: But this is not all the foundation of Subjection on the part of Man, and Authority on the part of God, but there are certain radical foundations of the Divine Authority and Sovereignty over Man; namely, 1. A right of Propriety, nothing can be more a Man's own than that which he gives a Being to: But the propriety that any Man can have in what he makes, is ſtill limited and qualified; firſt, becauſe he is not himſelf his own, he owes his Being to God, and therefore without the help of Divine Indulgence his acqueſts are like the acqueſts of a Servant, <hi>acquirit domino.</hi> And beſides, the Matter is not his own, whatſoever he makes, he makes out of that Matter that was not his own: But the propriety that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God acquires in his Creatures is abſolute, becauſe he himſelf is a Supreme and Sovereign Efficient, none is above him; and becauſe the Matter out of which he effected Man and all Corporeal Exiſtences was perfectly his own, it was Matter of his own making. 2. A right of abſolute Dominion and Sovereignty over his Creature; where the property is circumſcribed, limited, or qualified, the dominion is ſo too; but an
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:64147:182"/>
abſolute ſovereign property carries with it an abſolute ſovereign domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Proprietor. 3. An infinite irreſiſtible power to exert the right of his Dominion according to his Will: The two former Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations give him a ſovereign authority over his Creature, a right, <hi>jus diſponendi;</hi> but authority or right being divided from power to execute that authority and exact obedience to it is lame, but the glorious God hath not only an abſolute right of propriety and dominion over his Creature; but an infinite irreſiſtible power to rule, order, and diſpoſe it according to his Will: Almighty God tells us, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 18. that as the Clay is in the Potter's hand, ſo are Mankind in his hand, yea and in a far greater ſubordination and ſubjection to his Power; the power of the Potter over his Clay is a finite limited power, we ſee in the ſame place it reſiſted and diſappointed his intention by its untractable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But the power of God over his Creature is an infinite power, he that by his power made him in an inſtant, can in an inſtant diſſolve or annihilate him: And yet this infinite Power of God is under the management of a moſt wiſe, and holy, and pure, and gracious Will; and therefore though his Propriety be abſolute, his Dominion boundleſs, his Power infinite, yet the exerciſe of his Dominion and Power is full of Goodneſs, ſuitable to the moſt perfect nature of God: <hi>I am God, and not man, therefore ye ſons of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi> Here therefore we have that great Queſtion among ſome of the Ancients ſatisfactorily anſwered, namely, What is the Root of all Obligation in Mankind, whence comes the Obligation in the Conſciences of Men, what is it that binds Men to keep their Faith, their Promiſes? It is the Law and Command of him that hath ſovereign Authority to command, and infinite Power to exact Obedience, and to puniſh the want of it; all other foundations of Obligation are but weak and deficient without this, or in compariſon to it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In this Hiſtory of the primitive ſtate of Man, and his defection, we have the Solution of that great <hi>Quaeſitum</hi> that troubled the ancient Philoſophers, eſpecially the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> namely, Whence or how came it to paſs, that not only that great diſorder happens in things of this World, eſpecially in the nature and practices and cuſtoms of Mankind, ſome would have it from Matter, ſome from one thing, ſome from another; we ſee here a plain Solution of the <hi>Quaere,</hi> That it came not from God, no nor from Matter, but by the defection and diſobedience of the firſt Man, which brought Death into the World, and Sin and Corruption and Depravation and Diſorder into the Humane Nature, and brought diſorder and diſcompoſure upon the greateſt part of this lower World; which as it was principally made for the ſervice of Man, ſo it ſuffered a great Concuſſion and Breach by the Diſobedience and Apoſtacy of Man: and from this unhappy root ariſeth all the Diſorders and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the humane World; for although the Fall of Man did neither alter the eſſential Conſtituents of Mankind, nor wholly raze out the Engravings of thoſe common Notions, Sentiments, and rational In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts that were in them; yet it did in a great meaſure impair and weaken them, and brought in a very great deordination and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, ſetting up the lower Faculties in rebellion againſt the ſuperior; ſo that the wiſer and more morate part of Mankind were forced to ſet up
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:64147:183"/>
Laws and Puniſhments, to keep the generality of Mankind in ſome tolerable order.</p>
               <p n="11">11. This reaſonableneſs, congruity, and conſonancy to common Light and Reaſon in the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Formation of the World and Mankind, and the great preference that it hath above thoſe Inventions of the ancient Philoſophers touching the ſame; the admirable Solution of many of thoſe difficulties which are hereby ſolved, doth give a very great valuation and eſteem to the truth and Divine Authority of the Scriptures. It is true, their Authority is above the contribution of Humane Reaſon, or any Supplies it can bring either to its Truth or Authority: but yet when a Man ſhall ſee ſo great a clearneſs and plainneſs and reaſonableneſs in the Holy Scripture touching this great Truth, ſo many difficulties and abſurdities thereby avoided, ſo great a ſuffrage and atteſtation of Reaſon and common evidence bearing witneſs to this Truth, and to ſuch a Truth as could never be at firſt particularly diſcovered without Divine Revelation, yet being diſcovered, carries in it nothing of abſurdity, but a ſingular congruity both to it ſelf in the ſeveral parts of it, and to the common Reaſon.</p>
               <p>It is true, a great though a Miniſterial and Humane Suffrage to the truth and excellency of the Holy Scriptures, ſtrengthens our Faith, which God knows ſtands in need of all the contributions that may be, to bear up our Souls againſt that root of Infidelity that is in us; and may be inſtrumental and preparative to bring thoſe to the belief and veneration of the Scriptures who are without, and hardly perſwadible, but by thoſe <hi>media</hi> that bear a congruity to their natural Light and Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And therefore we have infinite reaſon to bleſs and magnifie the gracious God, that hath lent us his Holy Scriptures to inform us in things to be believed and to be done, and to contain and preſerve us <hi>infra cancellos certitudinis.</hi> The Lord knows, and we cannot chooſe but daily obſerve in our ſelves a ſtrange mobility and inſtability in our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Intellective Faculty, roving after every thing and in many things that we know, and much more in things we know not, framing ſtrange <hi>Chimaera</hi>'s, finding out many Inventions, was the firſt effect of the departure of Mankind from a revealed Truth, and ſearching after un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and forbidden Knowledge.</p>
               <p>And this hath been the courſe and walk and diſeaſe of our reſtleſs, moveable, unſtable, Mercurial Brains ever ſince in matters of Philoſophy, in matters of Religion: The merciful and wiſe God therefore, to keep in and regulate the extravagant and witleſs Spirit of Man, and to give us the clear knowledge of things neceſſary and uſeful, and to preſcribe and fix bounds, and banks, and limits to our moveable, unſtable, and unfixed Minds, hath given us theſe Sacred Oracles both to enlighten and inform us, and to fix and contain us within the bounds and limits of Truth and Sobriety.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I have before touched ſomething concerning a common Tradition that might obtain in the generality of Mankind, concerning the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the World and Man; and here we may find a reaſonable diſcovery of ſomething touching the root of this Tradition, namely, the Holy Scriptures, eſpecially that of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> for we find very much, among the ancient Heathen eſpecially, touching the Creation of the World, the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:64147:183"/>
Obſervation of the Seventh Day, the Flood, <hi>Noah</hi> and his three Sons, though by other Names; and divers other things, wherein though they mingle ſome of their own wild Notes, yet they bear a great analogy to the Relations in the Scriptures, and ſeem borrowed from them, or from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to whom that great Treaſure of the Scriptures was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And if a Man conſider how many Opportunities there were for the communication of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Learning to the reſt of Mankind, even in the ancient times, eſpecially to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> with whom they long dwelt, and with whom <hi>Solomon</hi> was joyned in affinity; ſo the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> during their Captivity there to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe they had with them after the breaking of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy: it will render it an eaſie Suppoſition, that much of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Learning was derived to many of the learned Heathen, though they oftentimes mingled with it ſome Conceptions of their own: <hi>Plato</hi> and divers other <hi>Grecians</hi> borrowed much of their traditional knowledge from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and they from the <hi>Hebrews. Vide Selden. de Jure Gentium, &amp;c. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Since Man in his firſt Original is the Work of the moſt wiſe intelligent Being, it is evident that Almighty God in this effection of Man did intend an end and ſcope of this Work: an intelligent Agent acts <hi>ex intentione &amp; volitione,</hi> and therefore propoſeth in his Work an end or purpoſe in it, and the deſignation of an end in working is the great perfection of an intelligent Agent: Agents that are ſimply Natural, or that are directed but by implanted Inſtincts, act by a kind of neceſſity of Nature, their activity and vigour putting it ſelf forth not by choice or election, but driven by the activity of their nature. And although it is viſible that all, even the moſt neceſſary operations of unintelligent Cauſes in the World, are directed unto certain excellent ends, yet the election of and direction to theſe ends is not in thoſe neceſſary and natural Cauſes themſelves; but is in that intelligent Efficient that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and deſigned that end, and endowed the natural Agent with thoſe active Faculties or Powers which might be proper and ſerviceable to ſuch ends, and mancipated or bound to them certain Inſtincts and natural Motions ſubſervient to thoſe ends. As in things that are artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, my Watch gives me an account of the Hour of the Day, that is the end thereof; but it is an end not deſigned or intended by the Watch, but of the Artiſt that made it.</p>
               <p>And although in ſenſible Creatures there ſeems to be an Image of Intelligence, and they move more perfectly to their ſeveral ends of their ſeveral operations; as in choice and eating of their food to preſerve their individual nature, in generation to preſerve their ſpecifical nature, yet the truth is, thoſe deſignations of the ends of theſe operations, and the furniſhing them with inſtincts in order thereunto, is due ſtill to that Intelligent Being, namely, the glorious God, which hath by his Wiſdom determined theſe ſenſible Creatures to theſe ends, and by theſe means, in the firſt inſtitution of their natures.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And upon the ſame reaſon it follows, That ſince Almighty God is the Maker and Efficient of Man, it is not only reaſonable and juſt, but natural, and in a manner neceſſary, that the deſignation of Man to his end ſhould belong to him that was his Efficient. And therefore
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:64147:184"/>
although the ſupreme intelligent Being, that Efficient of Mankind hath made Man an intelligent Being, endued him with Will, whereby he is in a manner <hi>Dominus ſuarum actionum,</hi> and a kind of Image of his Maker, yet he is not the Lord and diſpoſer of his own end; for though Man be made an intelligent and free Agent, and therefore in thoſe actions that move from himſelf he hath the priviledge of an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Agent, and propounds his end to himſelf in thoſe actions: yet he was not the Efficient of himſelf, and therefore cannot proportion to himſelf the end of his Being, but that belongs only to that intelligent Efficient that gave him his Being; and therefore that Efficient can only be the Propounder of that end which is commenſurate to his Being.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Since Almighty God is not only an Intelligent Agent, but the higheſt, moſt wiſe, powerful, and perfect Cauſe; and ſince it ſeems to be moſt ſuitable to ſuch a wiſe Being to proportionate the ends of his Works in ſome meaſure ſuitable to the worth and value of the Work. And ſince Man is the work and effection of God, and nobleſt work of his that we ſee in this inferior World, we have juſt reaſon to conclude, That Almighty God made Man for ſome end, and for ſome ſuch end as may bear a proportion to the nature, condition, and quality of the Work it ſelf.</p>
               <p>There ſeem to be but two ways to know the end that an intelligent Agent propounds in any action or work, 1. The firſt is plain, explicit, and clear, <hi>viz.</hi> When that Agent reveals and diſcovers what is the end he intends in the work he doth: and thus it hath pleaſed the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God to acquaint us in the Holy Scriptures, that his intent in making Man was his own Glory, and to make Man a Veſſel of everlaſting Happineſs. But becauſe in this place we are only making natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions from the effection of Man by God, I ſhall refer the conſideration of the former to its proper place. 2. Therefore the ſecond is by col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of natural and reaſonable Conſequences from the nature of the Efficient, and the worth, value, or condition of the Effect; and this <hi>medium</hi> though it be not ſo clear, particular, and explicit as the former, yet it doth give us ſome account touching the nature and kind of the end that is probably propounded by the Efficient: but touching the ſame in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>VVE may eaſily obſerve in general in the Works of Nature, and in every particular thereof, three kinds of admirable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, the Accommodation of every thing to the common beauty and integrity of the Univerſe: As in a curious piece of Landskip there
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:64147:184"/>
are orderly interſperſed Clouds, and Trees, and Flowers, and Rivers, and Houſes, and Arches, and Ships, and Fiſh playing, and Birds of ſeveral kinds, ſome flying, ſome ſwimming, ſome perching, yea various Flies and Worms and Inſects, and all contribute to the beauty and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and variety of the entire piece, though each hath a particular beauty of its own: So in this great and glorious Frame of the Univerſe not only the Celeſtial Bodies, but all the Animals and Vegetables, even to the leaſt Fly, or Worm, or Flower, or Herb, contribute to the beauty, glory, ornament, and variety of the whole; and make up one common demonſtration of the admirable Wiſdom of that great God, that made it <hi>valde bonum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly under this Conſideration it is apparently evident, that Man contributes no ſmall portion of beauty and ornament to this goodly Frame of the Univerſe: For if we ſhould ſuppoſe that all the Integrals of the inferior World were as now they are, only deſtitute of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called Man, it would ſoon appear that it wanted much of that beauty, and comelineſs, and perfection which it now hath by the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this excellent Integral of the Univerſe; which though it hath its reſidence in the lower region thereof, yet in the common compute and eſtimate of the whole it contributes to its beauty and integrity.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Accommodation of every thing, is to ſome other part or parts of the Univerſe; and this though it may be ſingle, or a reſpect only between ſome one ſingle part and ſome other ſingle part of Nature, yet for the moſt part we ſhall find every thing in Nature hath an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation unto very many other things; the Wiſdom of Almighty God being <hi>multifaria ſapientia,</hi> hath admirably evidenced it ſelf, in giving almoſt every thing in its nature a complexed and complicated accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to various other things of differing kinds and natures. This is more eminently conſpicuous in the Heavenly Bodies; for Inſtance, the Sun is accommodated to the uſe and convenience of the Planetary Bodies, and of this inferior World and of every part thereof, by his Poſition, by his Light, by his Heat, by his Motion it procures Generation for the reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of the Earth, raiſeth Clouds and Vapours to irrigate and water it, it occaſioneth Winds to move and communicate thoſe Irrigations, it gives variety of Seaſons, meaſures of Times, and infinite more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations to other things. If we come lower, to the Elementary World, the Air is accommodated as a fit <hi>medium</hi> for the derivation of Light and Influence from the Celeſtial Bodies; it is the vehicle of the Meteors, the means of Reſpiration, the food and life of the vital and animal Spirits, and many the like accommodations. If we conſider of Animals, we ſhall find admirable accommodations in them one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and eſpecially to Man: the Horſe, high-ſpirited, yet very docible, fitted for ſwiftneſs, carriage, and agility, by the make of his Body, his Neck, his Mouth, his Back, his Hoof; the Ox patient, painful, ſtrong, fitted for draught; the Camel fitted for ſtrength, and a natural Saddle for Burthen; the Cow for yielding Milk; the Sheep for Cloathing; the Beaſts and Birds of greateſt uſe being moſt commonly made tame, and affecting a ſpontaneous ſubjection to Man: among the Vegetables ſome are for Food, ſome for Medicines, ſome for Smell, ſome for Taſt: nay that ſeemingly moſt abject part of Nature, the Inſects, even the worſt
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:64147:185"/>
as well as the beſt of them, have their accommodation to other things; ſome for Food to the more perfect Animals, as Flies, Worms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome for Medicines both for Men and Animals; nay the very venemous Inſects are accommodated to the ſalubrity of the Earth and Waters, collecting the unwholſom Juyce of either into their own conſiſtency; and many that are poiſonous and hurtful, yet carry with them Antidotes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, as Vipers, Scorpions, and divers others.</p>
               <p>Although in the lower World there are various accommodations of things one to another, yet the chief and ultimate accommodation of things ſeems principally to terminate in Man. The Graſs of the Field is accommodate to the uſe of Animals for their food, and ſo are the Inſects for the food of Fiſh and Fowl, but theſe in their laſt particular accommodation are for the food or other uſe of Man. On the other ſide, Man is accommodate to the convenience and uſe of the Vegetables and Animals, but not in a way of Subſervience or Service, but in a way of Regiment, Order, Empire, and Protection, which he is enabled to exerciſe over the Creatures of greater ſtrength and bodily force, by the advantage of his Faculties wherein he exceeds them: Thus he is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to the Vegetable Nature, by Planting and Husbandry; to the Animal Nature by ſubduing the unruly and hurtful, by the diſciplining and managing the docible; by protecting the domeſtick, by providing for their wants. The accommodation of Brutes to Men is an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of an Inferior to a Superior; the accommodation of Man to Brutes is an accommodation of a Superior to an Inferior, an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Regiment and Protection.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of Accommodation is of every thing unto it ſelf; either in relation to its proper <hi>Species,</hi> by propagation of its kind; or in relation to its individual nature, which is that which I principally mean to ſpeak of. We may obſerve at leaſt in every Animal, 1. An accommodation of Faculties ſuitable to his nature, uſe, and convenience, which are principally theſe; Cogitation, Senſation, Phantaſie or Imagination, Appetite and power to Move it ſelf, though in various degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. 2. That all theſe Faculties are terminated in a ſenſitive Life, or Life of Senſe, and go no farther. 3. That all thoſe Faculties are exactly fitted with Organs proportionate to their Faculties, and the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical perfection of them: the Organs ſubſervient to the Faculties of the meaneſt Inſect, are as exquiſitly accommodated and fitted thereunto, as the Organs of a Horſe or an Elephant are accommodate to the ſpecifical Faculties of that Animal. 4. That the wiſe God hath proportioned Objects of the Appetites of every Animal exactly ſuitable to thoſe Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and a connatural proſecution and dexterity in the aſſecution of them: ſo that no natural Deſire or Appetite is in vain, or notional only, but really fitted and accommodated with an Object proportionable to it. 5. That every Animal hath its higheſt complacency and contentment in the attainment of the ſuitable Object of its Appetite, and this is its commenſurate Happineſs; the Fox, or the Lion, or the Otter hath no greater dexterity in the getting of his Prey, nor greater contentation in his acqueſt; than the Bee hath in getting Honey, or the Spider in catching his Fly.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed, we have therein generally included
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:64147:185"/>
the natural Method whereby we may by the Light of Nature ſearch out the true and ſpecial End for which we have reaſon to believe the great and wiſe Efficient made Man.</p>
               <p>It is true, that ſome things Man hath in common with the reſt of created viſible Beings, as that he is a corporeal Being, hath Life and Senſation, and is a beautiful Piece of the Furniture of this lower World. In theſe things therefore, or by them, we are not to ſeek that ſpecial End for which man was made; becauſe under theſe and the like Conſiderations he ſeems to have a common parity with other created Beings.</p>
               <p>But our ſearch muſt be, 1. Whether there be not ſome peculiarities in the Humane Nature, ſome Faculties and Powers, ſomething in his Conſtitution, and ſome adaptations and appropriate accommodations therein peculiar to his nature, and of a far more advanced uſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection than thoſe of the beſt of other inferior Animals; For if we find ſuch in Man, we have juſt reaſon to believe that the moſt wiſe Efficient of the Humane Nature, as he raiſed Man to a greater eminence not only of gradual but of ſpecifical perfection above the common Animal Nature, ſo he deſigned a more excellent and noble End for this more excellent and noble Work: For thus it became the greateſt Wiſdom, to deſign a more noble End to that which he conſtituted a more noble Being. 2. We are alſo to ſearch wherein this excellency and preference of the Humane Nature above the Animal conſiſts: For as the former Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration gives us a general Concluſion, That becauſe the Humane Nature is more excellent than the common Animal Nature, therefore the End or Deſign of the Conſtitution of the former is of a nobler kind than the Deſign of the Conſtitution of the latter; So this particular Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the excellencies of the Humane Nature above the Animal, gives us ſome Eſtimate, <hi>Criſes,</hi> or Indications what thoſe Ends may be which the wiſe Creator intended in the making of Man, namely, ſuch Ends as hold proportions to thoſe eminencies and excellencies wherein the Humane ſpecifically exceeds the Animal Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato,</hi> though a great Aſſertor of the Creation of Man by the Wiſdom and Power of Almighty God, yet in his 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book <hi>De Legibus</hi> ſeems to have too light an Expreſſion concerning the End of the making of Man, and of thoſe many excellencies in the Humane Nature, namely, <hi>Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Dei ludo eſſe fictum, atque id verè ipſius optimum eſſe.</hi> It is below the Dignity of the Divine Wiſdom, to think that he made Men, and endued them with thoſe excellent Faculties, only to behold them as a Play or a Scorn; or as the inconſiderate part of Mankind pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with beholding of Interludes, or Cock-fighting, or Bear-baiting: the Comical part of the Lives of Men are too full of Sin and Vanity, and the Tragical part thereof too full of Sin and Miſery to be a delightful Spectacle unto the pure and wiſe God, who certainly propounded more ſerious Ends than ſuch for ſo noble a Structure.</p>
               <p>The Saying therefore of <hi>Plato</hi> muſt be underſtood only analogically, and <hi>Epictetus</hi> may be his Scholiaſt, who wiſheth every Man to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Te eſſe actorem talis fabulae qualis Magistro probata fuerit; ſi brevis, brevis; ſi longa, longa: ſi mendicum agere te voluerit, fac eam quoque perſonam ingenioſè repraeſentes; ita ſi claudum, ſi principem, ſi plebeium: hoc enim tuum eſt, datam perſonam benè effingere, eam autem eligere, alterius.</hi> Teaching
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:64147:186"/>
us by the ſimilitude, that every Man's Station is ſubject to the Divine Providence, and every Man's Duty is to be contented with it.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Conſideration of the ſpecifical Excellence of the Humane Nature above the Animal Nature, and the deduction of thoſe Ends which we may from thence reaſonably conclude to be ſpecifical to him, and intended by his wiſe Creator.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is apparent that Man is the nobleſt of all the viſible Creatures, at leaſt of this inferior World, the Complement and chiefeſt Ornament thereof, without which it would be deſtitute of the moſt glorious Integral thereof: that all the viſible Creatures of this inferior World as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center in him, and are directed to him or his uſe, as their immediate End: that he is an Abſtract or <hi>Compendium</hi> of the greater World, as might eaſily be evidenced by the induction of particulars: that he hath complicated in him all the excellencies of the Elementary, Vital, and Animal Natures; that he hath ſuperadded thereunto a ſingular beauty, and majeſty, and uſefulneſs in the Structure of his Body, the admirable Faculties of Intellect, Reminiſcence, and Ratiocination, the Faculty of Speech, inſtitution of Signs to expreſs his inward Conceptions, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and Habits, Intellectual and Moral liberty and empire of Will, whereby he may, if he pleaſe, govern his ſenſitive Appetite, Paſſions, and inferior Faculties: So that he is <hi>nexus utriuſque mundi,</hi> the common Angle wherein the higheſt and nobleſt of Material and Corporeal Nature is joyned to the Spiritual and Intellectual. By all which, and many more Perfections, he is the nobleſt Inſtance of the Divine Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs in this inferior World.</p>
               <p>The Univerſe indeed is the great and goodly Type and Image of the Excellency and Glory of its Creator, but it is a vaſt and comprehenſive Volume, not comprehenſible by any Underſtanding but his that made it: But this leſſer World Man is a more compendious Abridgment, nearer unto us, and more diſcoverable by us; and though yet it hath exerciſed the inveſtigation of moſt induſtrious Minds and Searches without a full and perfect diſcovery of the leaſt part of all its Eminencies, yet in reſpect of its vicinity and obviouſneſs to Obſervation it yields a diſtinct and perceptible Evidence to us of the Wiſdom of its Maker. Thus the Humane Nature objectively and paſſively exhibits unto intelligent Beings a wonderful and admirable manifeſtation of the incomparable Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Power, and Excellency of him that firſt created it; and this was one End of Almighty God in the Creation of Man. And although it be true, that ſuch is the Self-ſufficiency and Happineſs of Almighty God, that it is not capable of any acceſſion by all the Inſtances of his Wiſdom and Goodneſs in the Works he hath made, nor by any Glory or Praiſe that from them can return unto him; yet it is not an End unworthy of the moſt perfect Being, to render his Magnificence and Goodneſs conſpicuous, and to receive that deſerved Honour and Praiſe of his Works that is the juſt Tribute due unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Divine Eſſential and Eternal Goodneſs is inſeparable from him, and this is the root of the Divine Beneficence, which latter though in its effluxes and emanations it be under the regiment of his own moſt holy and wiſe Will, yet it is diffuſive and communicative. That the World was at all made, is the Effect of this Divine Beneficence, which
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:64147:186"/>
when it had nothing beſides it ſelf unto which it might communicate it ſelf, it made all things, that according to their different natures and receptivities might participate of the Divine Beneficence: To things vegetable he hath given the Faculty of Life, Vegetation, and Growth; this is one participation of the Divine Goodneſs, <hi>per modum elſe viventis:</hi> and again, he communicates to theſe Faculties ſuitable Objects anſwering thoſe Vital Faculties; to Senſitive Nature his Beneficence hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated thoſe Faculties of Senſe as well as Life, and then communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to them a farther efflux of his Beneficence, by communicating to them the Objects grateful and uſeful both for Life and Senſe: thus his Beneficence is communicated to them <hi>per modum boni ſenſibilis;</hi> but to Man his Beneficence is communicated not only <hi>per modum boni vitalis &amp; ſenſibilis,</hi> which yet he enjoys as other Creatures, but <hi>per modum boni intellectualis &amp; voliti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, by giving him thoſe nobler Faculties of Intellection and Will, and then by communicating to thoſe Faculties Objects ſuitable to thoſe Powers or Faculties, namely, Intellectual Truths to his Underſtanding, and Moral, Rational, and Divine Good to his Will; and among all thoſe, <hi>vera &amp; bona,</hi> that are communicated to theſe Faculties by the Divine Beneficence, God himſelf, his Goodneſs, Truth, Will, Perfection, are the chiefeſt <hi>verum</hi> and the chiefeſt <hi>bonum.</hi> So that no Creature below Man is capable formally to know, to love, to enjoy God, as the chiefeſt Truth and chiefeſt Good: And this alſo ſeems to be another End of the Creation of Man, that being made a Creature endued with Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will, he might be receptive of the <hi>Effluxus</hi> of the Divine Beneficence in a nobler way than the other viſible Creatures of this lower World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As under the firſt Conſideration Man is more eminently an objective manifeſtation of the Divine Glory, than other viſible Creatures; and as under the ſecond Conſideration Man is more receptive of the Divine Beneficence than other viſible Creatures: So upon farther examination we ſhall find, that Man was made in a capacity to be a more active Inſtrument to ſerve and glorifie his Maker than other viſible Creatures, which was another End of his Creation ſpecifically different from the End of other viſible created Natures, which will appear by the farther conſideration of thoſe two great diſtinguiſhing Faculties, his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not go about to make a large Deſcription of thoſe Faculties, or the Operation, but only obſerve ſo much touching them as may reaſonably evidence the preference that Man hath therein above the inferior Animals, and the Inferences that ariſe thereupon touching the End of Almighty God in the making Man.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the Intellective Faculty: As in Animals the Faculties of Senſe internal and external, eſpecially the Viſive Faculty, placeth Animals in a rank of Being far above the inſenſible Creatures, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates them exquiſitly to a Life of Senſe; ſo the Intellective Faculty placed in Man puts him into a rank of Beings far above the moſt perfect Animals, and accommodates the Humane Nature to an Intellectual Life. And the preheminence of this Faculty above the Faculty of Senſe, will appear if we conſider the Operations thereof; I ſhall inſtance but
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:64147:187"/>
in two, namely, intellective Perception and intellective Ratiocination or Diſcourſe: 1. For the intellective Perception; the Underſtanding perceives many things which are not perceptible by Senſe or ſenſitive Phantaſie or Imagination; for Inſtance, it hath the perception of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or Being abſtracted from all ſenſible qualities: it hath the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the truth or falſity of a Propoſition, it perceives the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and the Evidence thereof in the Premiſes, and many more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Objects which never did nor can fall under the perception of Senſe or Imagination: And although we cannot clearly underſtand all the Operations of the Brutal Phantaſie, becauſe we are diſtinct from them, and they have not the inſtrument of Speech intelligible by us to expreſs their perceptions; yet we may know that this is true by our ſelves, for we may perceive that we do perceive theſe Objects not to be perceptible by our Faculties of Senſe, but by ſome other Faculties diſtinct from that of Senſe or ſenſitive Imagination. Again, in thoſe Objects that are objective to Senſe, the intellective perception diſcovers ſomewhat that is apparently unperceived by the Senſe or ſenſitive Imagination; for Inſtance, the Heavenly Bodies, the Sun, Moon, and Stars are equally objected to the view as well of Animals as Men; but yet by the help of intellective perception Man perceives that in thoſe Objects which neither the Brutes, no nor Man himſelf by the bare perception of Senſe or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Phantaſie doth not, cannot perceive: The perception of Senſe gives us the Sun no bigger than a Buſhel, and the Stars than a Candle, cannot diſcover an inequality of their diſtance from us; judgeth the body of the Moon to have as many changes in figure and quality as it hath various <hi>Phaſes</hi> or Appearances, the Sun really to ſet, the Limb of the Heavenly Horizon to be contiguous to the Earth: but the intellective perception finds the quantity of the Sun and Stars bigger than the Earth, and by the Parallaxes and Eclipſes finds the Stars more diſtant from us than the Sun, and that than the Moon; perceives diſtinctly their ſeveral Motions, Orders, Poſitions, and makes diſtinctions and computations of Time and Duration by them, and over-rules and confutes the perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Senſe and Imagination by another kind of perception, above the perception of Senſe. 2. Touching Ratiocination or Diſcurſive Operation, the precedure thereof is above the reach of the ſenſitive Phantaſie, though this ſeems to carry ſome weak and imperfect Image thereof: For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſometimes not only the <hi>media diſcurſûs</hi> and the <hi>proceſſus diſcurſivus</hi> are out of the reach of Senſe, but the very <hi>ſubjectum diſcurſûs</hi> is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to Senſe: ſuch are that <hi>proceſſus diſcurſivus</hi> of the Underſtanding touching complexed Notions or Univerſals; touching the abſtracted Notions of Being, Subſtance, Entity, and tranſcendents in Metaphyſicks; ſuch are alſo the diſcurſives of moral good and evil, juſt, unjuſt, which are no more perceptible to Senſe than Colour is to the Ear; and yet touching theſe Subjects the Intellect forms Diſcourſes, deduceth Illations and Concluſions. Again, in matters Mathematical and Phyſicall, though in the concrete, and in their ſubjects they are objective to Senſe, yet the <hi>media</hi> and <hi>proceſſus diſcurſivus</hi> whereby the Underſtanding makes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, and Inferences, and Illations touching them, are of a range and kind quite above the range of Senſe or ſenſitive Imagination; thus upon certain <hi>data</hi> or <hi>poſtulata</hi> in Geometry, the Intellect forms Concluſions,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:64147:187"/>
which though Mechanically and Experimentally true, yet are elicited by a <hi>Proceſſus diſcurſivus,</hi> quite above the activity of ſenſitive Phantaſie. And though matters Phyſical, Bodies, and Tangible qualities, and their ſeveral powers, manner of production, and divers other things relating to them are ſenſible Objects; yet the Intellect uſeth a <hi>Proceſſus diſcurſivus,</hi> whereby it inveſtigates Truths, and draws Concluſions that are quite above the ſcantlet of Senſe or Phantaſie, aſcending up from the Effect to the next Cauſe, and thence to the next, and thence gradually to the Firſt Cauſe of all things. So that though oftentimes the foot or root of the <hi>Diſcurſus intellectivus</hi> be bottomed in ſome ſenſible Object, perchance of no great moment and importance, yet by this <hi>Proceſſus diſcurſivus</hi> the Intellect riſeth higher and higher, and quickly taketh a flight out of the ken or reach of Senſe, in Conſequences, Diſcurſive Inferences, and Concluſions; and follows the Chain higher and higher, till it come to the uppermoſt ring thereof, faſtened, as the Poets wittily feign, to the Throne of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>And thus far of theſe two excellent Operations of this Intellective Faculty, namely, Intellective Perception and Diſcourſe. But beſides theſe operations and active exertions of the Underſtanding, there ſeems to be two kinds of accommodations to it, which are admirably ſerviceable to the improving and perfecting of its operations; the one internal, the other external.</p>
               <p>The internal is this; As we find in the Senſitive Nature certain congenit or connatural Inſtincts, whereby they are ſecretly and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully biaſſed, and inclined, and carried to their proper ſenſitive Good, either individual or ſpecifical; ſuch as are their inclination to that Food that is ſuitable for them, their <hi>Appetitus procreativus,</hi> their care for their Young, and infinite more; ſo there ſeems to be lodged in the Intellective and Rational Nature certain Rudiments and Tendencies, whereby they are carried to the good of an intellectual Life, certain <hi>communes notitiae,</hi> lodged and connaturally implanted in the Intellect, which ſerve as a kind of connatural inward ſtock for the Underſtanding to work upon, and alſo as a ſecret biaſs and inclination to carry him on to the good of an intellectual Life: Such as are a ſecret inſcribed Notion that there is a God, that he is to be worſhipped, honoured, ſerved, and obeyed; and certain inſcribed common Notices of Moral Good and Evil, that make him propenſe to Juſtice, Honeſty, to do as he would be done by, and the like. And although evil Cuſtoms, and the prevalence of the ſenſual Appetite may in a great meaſure weaken and impair thoſe common Notions when they come to particulars and particular applications, yet it is evident in all Ages and Nations, by a kind of connaturality Mankind hath ever retained theſe two great, and noble, and diſcriminating deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, namely, firſt to be <hi>Animal religioſum,</hi> ariſing from the energy of thoſe <hi>infinitae notitiae</hi> relating to God; and to be <hi>Animal politicum &amp; ſociale,</hi> ariſing from theſe <hi>inſitae notitiae</hi> of Moral Good and Evil, and thoſe connatural inſitions of Morality implanted in his nature, which are the great and chief ſupport of humane Society.</p>
               <p>The external accommodation of the Intellective Faculty, is that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, that hath ſo ordered things, that firſt of all Mankind is accommodated with thoſe Faculties of Senſe,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64147:188"/>
eſpecially that of Sight, whereby he may perceive all ſenſible Objects that arrive within the diſtance of their activity: And ſecondly, in that he hath expoſed a very conſiderable part of his admirable Works to that Senſe of his. Had Man been born blind, though his intellective Faculty had been excellent, yet that Faculty had been very unactive, in this Life at leaſt, becauſe the <hi>Baſis</hi> or Root of much of its operation depends upon the reception of ſenſible viſible Objects: and had he been endued with Senſe, yet if the excellent Works of God had been at ſo great a diſtance that they had not been perceptible by him, he had wanted a great contribution to the perfecting of his intellective Faculty. The Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs hath ſo ordered things, that he hath not only that receptive Faculty of Senſe, eſpecially that of Sight, but hath alſo preſented to his view a great and conſiderable part of the Univerſe with great advantage, beauty, and clearneſs, the inferior or Elementary World with all its variety and ſtore, and the proſpect of the goodly Celeſtial Bodies, their poſitions, motions, beauty, order, and excellence. And this goodly <hi>Apparatus</hi> of the Univerſe thus objectively derived to his Underſtanding, furniſheth it with an outward Stock, upon which it may trade and exerciſe it ſelf with great delight and advantage; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The knowledge of things Phyſical and Natural, the State, Order, and Oeconomy of Nature; the Virtue, Efficacy, and Energy of Second Cauſes, and their Effects: herein he hath a vaſt extent of the Inferior and Celeſtial World to exerciſe himſelf in, and certainly this bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a thing of excellent improvement and contentation of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, and far exceeds all ſenſible Delights; in ſo much that many wiſe and knowing Men have choſen to ſequeſter themſelves from the common Employments and Contents of Mankind, for the ſake of a Life of Philoſophical Speculation: But this is the loweſt part of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is hereby acquirable, there is yet a more noble and excellent knowledge acquirable hereby, that advanceth and improveth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Nature to a very great and high perfection. 2. Therefore that knowledge that is hereby acquirable is the knowledge of the Glorious God, the firſt Creator, and great Conſerver and Governour of all things. I have before ſaid, that the Goodneſs of God had lodged an inward Stock in Man whereby to improve his Intellectual Nature, namely, thoſe <hi>communes notitiae</hi> of the Exiſtence of a God, and that he is to be worſhipped, ſerved, and obeyed, the common Root of Religion in Mankind; theſe are in him like the firſt Rudiments of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> the <hi>Embryo</hi> of Religion, or the Egg as it were out of which it is hatched. The contemplation of the admirable Works in the World doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fortifie and improve thoſe firſt Rudiments of Natural Religion, digeſts them into their juſt formation. In theſe we ſee, and admire, and glorifie the Power, the Wiſdom, the Goodneſs, the Preſence of God; from theſe we learn his Unity, his Eternity, his Immenſity, his Providence, his Juſtice, his Mercy: And as thus <hi>aſcendendo</hi> we learn to know God by his Works, ſo again <hi>deſcendendo</hi> we learn our duty to praiſe, glorifie, magnifie, honour, love, fear, and obey him, to depend upon him, to delight in him: and by this means Natural Religion arrives to a great advance, and the Intellectual Nature mightily perfected and improved; and Man becomes not only a paſſive, a receptive Inſtrument to glorifie
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:64147:188"/>
his Maker, but an active Inſtrument of his Glory; which was, as is premiſed, another End of Almighty God in the making of Man, namely, That he might be an active intellectual Inſtrument to glorifie God, and in glorifying him, the more fully to enjoy him, and his favour, love, and goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As thus the Intellective Faculties render Man fit actively to ſerve and glorifie his Maker, ſo alſo that other Faculty of his Will contributes alſo in like manner to render him fit for that employment. We ſhall for this purpoſe only conſider theſe two Properties in the Will.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The liberty of the Will, whereby it hath power to determin it ſelf, and is free from all force and coaction; and upon this account, namely, that Man is not only an intellectual Creature, but alſo hath liberty of Will, he becomes a Creature properly ſuſceptive of a Law, and capable of Rewards and Puniſhments; that which acts out of coaction, as bare Inſtruments, or out of neceſſity, as bare Natural Cauſes, or a determined Inſtinct, as Brutes, are not properly capable of a Law but only analogically, and what they do is not properly an act of Obedience, becauſe they cannot ordinarily do otherwiſe. Therefore as his Intellective Faculty gives him the power to know his duty, ſo the liberty of his Will is that which gives him the power truly to obey.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond property of the Will is, that it is moved and drawn to that which is good, or at leaſt what appears to be ſo. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Appetite is a power ſubſervient to a ſenſitive Nature, and carried to a ſenſible Good; but the Will is a rational Faculty, a Faculty of an intellectual Nature, and carried to an intellectual Good as its proper Object, and therefore with moſt earneſtneſs, to the moſt noble and ſupreme Good, which is Almighty God. So that as by the liberty of his Will Man is capable to be an active Inſtrument to ſerve and obey his Maker, ſo by this property of his Will he is by a juſt ſuitableneſs drawn to will and deſire, and in enjoyment to delight in God as the chiefeſt Good, the moſt noble and ſuitable Object of its choice and motion: And we may obſerve, that the Divine Goodneſs and Wiſdom, to promote and advance this act of the Will, in chooſing and loving Almighty God as his chiefeſt Good, hath exhibited himſelf unto Mankind in all the manifeſtation of Goodneſs and Beneficence imaginable, hath made him Lord of this inferior World, provides for him, ſupplies him, and endears him to himſelf with all thoſe manifeſtations of Mercy, Goodneſs, and Bounty that his nature is capable of, whereby he may be won to love God not only as the chiefeſt Good, but alſo as his chiefeſt Benefactor. And thus by the due conſideration of both theſe Faculties of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will, we may reaſonably conjecture, that the End of Almighty God in creating Man, was to make ſuch a Creature as might actively know, ſerve, glorifie, love, and obey his Creator, and in that his Service, and Obedience, and Love, enjoy the Love and Favour of that God whom he thus loves and obeys, becauſe we find his Faculties admirably fitted for ſuch an end and uſe; and certainly the wiſeſt Agent muſt needs be ſuppoſed to deſign ſuch an End to any Work as is ſuitable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to the thing he makes: And theſe ſeem to be thoſe Ends for which the wiſe God created this noble Creature Man, which do more ſpecially relate unto God.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:64147:189"/>5. I ſhall now conſider the Ends of Man as they mutually relate one to another. There are theſe particularities in the Humane Nature that ſingularly commend Man each to other; namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A great love and propenſity to Communion and Society; <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> ſomewhere in his <hi>Politicks</hi> tells us, that among Animals Bees ſeem to be the moſt ſociable, but that Man is by nature more ſociable than Bees.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there are implanted certain connatural tendencies, or moral Principles that do moſt naturally ſuit with humane ſociety; ſuch as the firſt Rudiments of natural Juſtice, Charity, and Benignity, without which it is impoſſible that humane ſociety can be upheld. And this appears hereby, that though it is apparent that evil Educations and Cuſtoms have much defaced and weakned the Principles of Morality among Men, yet they could never extinguiſh it, but even among the Briars and Thorns the Rudiments of natural Juſtice and Morality have ariſen, and all the Order, and Government, and common Regiment of Societies have been maintained and preſerved by it:
<q>Naturam expellas furca licet, uſque recurret.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That the benefit of Speech, and thoſe other inſtituted Signs pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar only to Mankind are of great and principal uſe in maintaining and upholding Society and Communication between Mankind: by theſe each Man communicates his Thoughts and Conceptions to another; each Man inſtructs, directs, and adviſeth another, and makes another partaker of his own Knowledge, Wiſdom, Counſel, and Advice; by this, Contracts and mutual Commerce are upheld, the mutual Faith of each other given and taken, and infinite other advantages: by all which particularities and accommodations of Humane Nature ſubſervient to mutual Society and Love, it ſeems reaſonable to conclude, That the wiſe God intended as one of his Ends of the Creation of Man, that Man ſhould be beneficial to Man, ſhould be inſtrumental for the good of humane Society.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There appears in Man, beſides the ſpeculative power of his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, a certain admirable ingeny and dexterity in diſcovering and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting divers Arts as well Mechanical as Liberal, for the benefit, delight, and convenience of the Humane Nature: The great Arts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Political, Civil, and Oeconomical, the Arts of Husbandry, and Improvements of Nature for Food, Clothing, Medicine; the Arts of Geometry, Arithmetick, and artificial Meaſuring and Partition of Time; the Arts of Architecture, Navigation; the Art of contriving Letters, Writing, Printing; the Arts of Muſick, and Obſervations of the Laws, Orders, and Rules of the Motions and Poſitions of the Celeſtial Bodies, or Aſtronomy; and infinite more, which by the Ingeny and Induſtry of Man have been invented, diſcovered, or perfected in all ſucceſſion of Ages, for the uſe, benefit, and delight of Mankind.</p>
               <p>And although we may obſerve an admirable ſagacity and dexterity in many Animals, in certain kind of artifices convenient for their uſe and the uſe of Mankind, as in the nidification of Birds, Bees, Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, and divers others, yet Man hath ſtill the prelation; 1. In reſpect of the variety and multiplicity of his Artificial Inventions and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:64147:189"/>
Effections: commonly the Artifices of Irrational Natures are ſingle and determinate, but the Arts invented and effected by Man are multifarious, various, and almoſt infinite. 2. Beſides, his rational Faculty is more excellent and perfect than the Faculties of other Creatures in relation to Arts, and more fruitful in it. 3. That one Inſtrument his Hand, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> well calls <hi>Organum organorum,</hi> is admirably ſuited and fitted to all variety of Artificial effections more than any of the Organs of other Creatures, as our own Experience without the induction of many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars may eaſily demonſtrate and evince. By all which, and many other peculiar and diſtinguiſhing adaptations and accommodations of the Humane Nature, we may reaſonably conclude, That the wiſe God in lodging of theſe particularities in the Humane Nature, had one End and Deſign to make Humane Nature beneficent and uſeful to Mankind and to humane ſociety. And therefore that Precept ſo often inculcated by Chriſt and his Apoſtles of Love, Charity, and Beneficence from Man to Man, was no other than the re-enacting of that old Commandment, and directing Man to one of thoſe Ends for which he was made, and which hath ſo many Indications of it ſelf by the peculiar Conſtitution, Make, and Accommodations of our Faculties.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But yet farther, the Creation of Man ſeems to have a farther End even in relation to this inferior World, and the Animals and Vegetables themſelves, which deſerves to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We may eaſily obſerve among the Creatures of this lower World inferior to Man, that there are ſeveral Ranks of Beings, like ſo many ſeveral Provinces, but eſpecially the Animal and Vegetable Province. Among Animals ſome are fierce, ſtrong, and untameable, as Lions, Tigers, Wolves, Foxes, Dragons, Serpents; and theſe ſtand in need of ſome coercive power over them, that they deſtroy not the <hi>Species</hi> of more profitable, and yet weaker Animals. Again, there are ſome Animals that are more uſeful and ſerviceable to Man, which are more obnoxious to be preyed upon and depredated, and their <hi>Species</hi> to be utterly deſtroyed by the invaſion of the more fierce, voracious, and unruly Animals, as Sheep, Cows, and divers others, which ſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more in need of protection and preſervation; and thoſe of the more voracious and fierce nature are leſs ſubject to be diſciplined, tamed, and brought into ſubjection; the other are by their very nature more domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, domeſtick, and ſubject to be governed: and the like we may obſerve in many kinds of Fowls; as there are Beaſts of prey ſo there are Birds of prey, and others more manageable and obnoxious to injury.</p>
               <p>Again, if we look into the Vegetable Province, ſome Herbs and Plants are more tender and delicate, and ſtand in continual need of cultivation, and their very Seeds ſtand in need of a more than ordinary care both in reference to their preſervation and proſemination, without which in a little time their very <hi>Species</hi> would be loſt, or at leaſt ſtrangely degenerate; ſuch are many ſorts of Fruit-Trees, Herbs, and choice Flowers. Again on the other ſide, there are multitudes of ſpontaneous productions of Vegetables, or ſuch as are ſo hardy and prolifick, though leſs profitable or uſeful, that without a ſuperintendent induſtry to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their exceſs, would uſurp the whole face of the Earth, and make it a Wilderneſs, as ſome ſorts of hardy Trees, Weeds, Thorns, Briars,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:64147:190"/>
and other more unprofitable excreſcences; nay the very Superficies of the Earth without a ſuperintendent Cultivation would grow either marſhy and boggy by the defluxion of Waters, or altogether weedy and over-grown with exceſſive excreſcences: And though much of this either infertility or unprofitable excreſcence might be the fruit of the Sin of Man, yet the Wiſe God that foreſaw this Sin and the Effect thereof, was not wanting in providing a fit proviſional Remedy againſt it; that ſo this part of the Work of his Creation might retain its beauty and uſe. And though after the Fall of Man this difficulty of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was greater, by reaſon of the Curſe that thereby befell the Earth, yet even before the Fall the nature of his Employment was the ſame: <hi>He put the Man into the garden of Eden, to dreſs and to keep it. Gen.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>In relation therefore to this inferior World of Brutes and Vegetables, the End of Man's Creation was, that he ſhould be the Vice-Roy of the great God of Heaven and Earth in this inferior World; his Steward, <hi>Villicus,</hi> Bayliff or Farmer of this goodly Farm of the lower World, and reſerved to himſelf the ſupreme Dominion, and the Tribute of Fidelity, Obedience, and Gratitude, as the greateſt Recognition or Rent for the ſame, making his Uſufructuary of this inferior World to husband and order it, and enjoy the Fruits thereof with ſobriety, moderation, and thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>And hereby Man was inveſted with power, authority, right, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, truſt, and care, to correct and abridge the exceſſes and cruelties of the fiercer Animals, to give protection and defence to the manſuete and uſeful, to preſerve the <hi>Species</hi> of divers Vegetables, to improve them and others, to correct the redundance of unprofitable Vegetables, to preſerve the face of the Earth in beauty, uſefulneſs, and fruitfulneſs. And ſurely, as it was not below the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God to create the very Vegetable Nature, and render the Earth more beautiful and uſeful by it, ſo neither was it unbecoming the ſame Wiſdom to ordain and conſtitute ſuch a ſubordinate Superintendent over it, that might take an immediate care of it.</p>
               <p>And certainly if we obſerve the ſpecial and peculiar accommodation and adaptation of Man, to the regiment and ordering of this lower World, we ſhall have reaſon, even without Revelation, to conclude that this was one End of the Creation of Man, namely, To be the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent of Almighty God, in the ſubordinate Regiment eſpecially of the Animal and Vegetable Provinces.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Earth, and Vegetables, and Animals ſtand in need of ſuch a Superior Nature to keep them in a competent order: an ordinary Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation lets us ſee how ſoon thoſe Regions uninhabited by Mankind become rude Foreſts and Wilderneſſes, how deſtitute they are of thoſe manſuete Animals, being expoſed without a protector to be the prey of ſavage Beaſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Man, by the advantage of his intellectual ſagacity and contrivance, is fitted for this Regiment: For although there be many Beaſts much ſtronger than he, as Lions, Tigers, Wolves, and others, yet he is by the advantage of this Faculty enabled to avoid, and over-match, and ſubdue them, and by the advantage of this Faculty hath power to reclaim
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:64147:190"/>
thoſe that are reclaimable, though of greater ſtrength than himſelf; as Horſes, Elephants, Camels, and to protect and provide for the ſafety and food of thoſe that are either by Art or Nature rendred manſuete, as Horſes, Sheep, Oxen, and to make them ſubſervient to his ends and uſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though of all other viſible Creatures Man ſeems the leaſt provided with natural offenſive Organs, yet by the advantage of his intellectual Faculty and that admirable <hi>Organum organorum</hi> his Hand, he is infinitely advantaged with artificial helps to defend himſelf, and ſubjugate the moſt contumacious and furious Brute: The Lion, the Bear, the Tiger, the Wolf, the Horſe, the Elephant, the Bull are furniſhed with natural offenſive and defenſive Munition; but by the advantage of the Hand, Man is able to provide himſelf more ſerviceable Artillery, as Swords, Pikes, Arrows, Darts, Nets, Trapps, Toyls, and to uſe them with greater ſecurity and advantage.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may alſo obſerve a kind of connatural neceſſity impoſed upon Man to exerciſe this Oeconomy and Regiment over Animals and Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, for his own preſervation and defence; without the exerciſe of this Regiment he would be over-run with ſavage and noxious Animals, he would want the ſpeed of the Horſe, the induſtry of the Ox, the Clothing of the Sheep, the Milk of the Cow: without this Regiment he would be without Corn to feed him, Wine to refreſh him, Medicine to recover him, the Earth would become a barren Foreſt or Wilderneſs, over-run with Bryars and Thorns. And it is obſervable, That as the wiſe God hath put all things in motion and action, the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Elementary Natures, the Meteors, the Animals; ſo it is his Wiſdom to preſerve Man alſo in bodily as well as mental motion, and by a kind of neceſſity driven him from ſloth and idleneſs; if he will live he muſt eat, and if he will eat he muſt labour. Though by the Fall of Man his labour is fuller of toyl and vexation, yet labour and induſtry was part of his duty and employment in the very ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
               <p>As he hath a buſie office and employment committed unto him, namely, to be God's Vicegerent and ſubordinate Officer in the Regiment of the Vegetable and Animal Provinces, ſo he is under a neceſſity for his own preſervation, and under an advantage for his own profit and convenience, induſtriouſly and vigilantly to exerciſe the Province com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him.</p>
               <p>Thus the infinite Wiſdom of Almighty God chains things together, and fits and accommodates all things ſuitable to their uſes and ends.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And yet farther, there ſeems to be found in the Humane Nature certain Affections that carry it on effectually to this employment, his love to himſelf, his ſafety, his convenient ſupplies, wealth, and plenty, invite induſtry and pains, and a complacency and delight attends the acqueſts of honeſt induſtry and pains.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hitherto we have ſeen this part of the End of Man's Creation, namely, to be a ſubordinate Rector of this inferior World, a Tributary King thereof by Inveſtiture from God himſelf, which Inveſtiture was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon Man in his firſt Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.29. and again renewed after the Fall and Flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Thou haſt made him to have
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:64147:191"/>
dominion over the works of thy hands, thou haſt put all things under his feet.</hi> But there is yet another Office, another End in the Creation of Man, with relation to this inferior World and the Furniture thereof.</p>
               <p>Almighty God in the goodly Frame of this World hath manifeſted the exceeding greatneſs of his Wiſdom and Power, as in the Heavenly Bodies, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Elements, the Meteors, the Minerals, the Vegetables, the Animals, they all make up a moſt magnificent and ſtately Temple, and every Integral thereof full of wonder, and bears the Inſcription of the infinite Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Power of the Glorious God; yet ſtill all theſe are but paſſive, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive, and objective reflections of the Goodneſs and Glory of God: there is not a Graſs in the Field, not a Tree in the Foreſt, nor the ſmalleſt inſect Animal, the Fly, the Worm, but bear an Inſcription of the incomparable Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs of the Glorious God. But yet theſe cannot actively glorifie their Maker, they underſtand not their own original nor their own excellence; the nobleſt Cedar in the Field, nor the vaſteſt Elephant in the <hi>Indies,</hi> nor the goodlieſt Whale in the Ocean have not the ſenſe of their own excellence, nor from whom they had it, nor can actively and intentionally return Praiſe and Glory to their Maker, for they want an intellective Principle to make thoſe diſcoveries or returns.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Glorious God therefore ſeems to have placed Man in this goodly Temple of the World, endued him with Knowledge, Underſtanding, and Will, laid before him theſe glorious Works of his Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that he might be the common Procurator, the vicarious Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, the common High Prieſt of the inanimate and irrational World, to gather up as it were the admirable Works of the Glorious God, and in their behalf to preſent the Praiſes, Suffrages, and Acclamations of the whole Creation unto the Glorious God, and to perform that for them, and as their common Procurator, which they cannot actively, intellectually, and intentionally perform for themſelves. It is true, the whole Creation doth objectively and according to their ſeveral capacities ſet forth the Honour and Glory of their Creator, and cry, <hi>Bleſſing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, glory, and power be unto him that ſittteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever;</hi> Revelat. 5.13. and the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. calls upon them all to perform that duty: But Man above all viſible Creatures is able to perform that duty intellectually and intentionally, and fitted to be the common Procurator and High Prieſt of unintelligent Creatures, intelligently on their behalf to preſent all their Praiſes and Acclamations to their common Creator, Lord, and Sovereign.</p>
               <p>I have now done with thoſe Ends for which we may reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture Man was made; Firſt, in relation to Almighty God; that he might actively Know, Love, Serve, Honour, and Obey Him: Secondly, in relation to others of Mankind; mutual Beneficence, Juſtice, and Charity: Thirdly, in relation to the inferior Creatures; to be their ſubordinate Regent under God, and to be the common Prieſt for the reſt of the viſible Creation, to preſent their Recognitions and Praiſes to their Maker.</p>
               <p>I now come to conſider what we may reaſonably conjecture might be the End of the Wiſe and Glorious God in the Creation of Man in
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:64147:191"/>
relation to himſelf. The former Ends were ſuch as were terminated without him, either to God, the reſt of Mankind, or the unintellectual Creatures; but this Enquiry is touching that End that is terminated in himſelf; the former were Ends of Office or Duty, this of Fruition or Enjoyment.</p>
               <p>And in this Enquiry I ſhall firſt proceed Negatively, to ſhew what this End is not; and then Affirmatively, as far as the Light of Nature and natural Reaſon will dictate (for in this Diſcourſe at preſent I go no farther) what it is, or may be reaſonably concluded to be.</p>
               <p>As to the former, or Negative Procedure,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore I ſay the proper, peculiar end of Man in point of fruition is not a ſenſible fruition, or a Life of Senſe, but ſomewhat that is higher, nobler, and of another nature. It is true, that as Man agrees in the animal Nature with other Animals, and conſequently hath a Life of Senſe as well as they, therein they participate of one common end: but that which we are enquiring concerning, is, the ſpecifical peculiar End of Man, appropriate to, and deſigned for him as ſuch; and therein it is that we affirm the end of his fruition is not the end of a ſenſible Being, but of a Nature ſpecifically and vaſtly different from it. And this I ſhall prove, and alſo illuſtrate by theſe following Reaſons and Concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As I have before obſerved the Method of ſearch and enquiry into the ſpecifical or peculiar end of any Exiſtence, is by obſerving the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical and peculiar exiſtence of Faculties of that Being; for we have reaſon to think, that the ſpecifical and peculiar end thereof is ſomewhat that bears a ſpecifical proportion to thoſe Faculties and Excellencies: thus we reaſonably conclude, That ſince the Animal Nature hath a ſpecifical and peculiar excellence and faculty above Vegetables, namely, the faculty of Senſe, that therefore its proper end of fruition is not a bare fruition of a vegetable Life or the commenſurate Good thereof, but a Good that is ſuperior, and accommodate to the Life of Senſe. And upon the ſame account we may conclude, That ſince the Excellence and Faculties of the Humane Nature are of a higher Make and Order than that of Senſe, namely, an intellectual Faculty; therefore the peculiar end of the Humane Nature is not terminated in a Life of Senſe, or a fruition of that Good which is not only proportionate or accommodate to a ſenſible Life or Nature, but in a fruition of ſomething anſwerable to the eminence and nature of an intellective Faculty. Now it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to any conſiderate Man, that the Operations, the Objects, the Delight of the intellectual and rational Faculties of Underſtanding and Will, lye higher than the Faculties of Senſe, and have little communion with them: The very contemplation of natural Cauſes and Effects, if we went no higher, are not in order to a ſenſitive Good, but often deprive us of it: the contemplation and action of moral Virtues are above the reach of Senſe; tranquillity of Mind, peace of Conſcience, perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and fruition of the favour and love of God, the ſatisfaction of the Underſtanding in that contemplation, the motion and tendency of the Will towards it as its chiefeſt Good: Theſe are things that delight and pleaſe the Intellectual Nature, (if not baſely and groſly immerſed in, and proſtituted to the Animal Nature) are more grateful, ſapid, and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:64147:192"/>
delightful to the Mind, than the beſt <hi>Apparatus</hi> or Proviſions of a ſenſible Good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, it is apparent that the very excellency and preference of the Intellectual Nature doth render the fruition of the Good of Senſe leſs good, leſs ſatisfactory, than it is to the Brutes: the Good of Senſe is ſo far from being the ſpecifical or peculiar end of Man, that the very Make, Texture, and Order of his nobler Faculties renders it not only incomplete, but deficient, and leſs competent to him, than if he had not this excellency of Faculties which are ſpecifical to his Nature. And therefore certainly it can never be that Good that is the appropriate end of fruition in Man, for it is leſs good to the Beaſts, and that even upon the very account of the excellencies of his Faculties: I ſhall give many Inſtances hereof.</p>
               <p>The fruition of the delights of Senſe in the Beaſts are more entire, ſimple, and unallayed than they are in Men; becauſe it is apparent, that in the Intellective Nature there is ſomething that checks, controls, and ſowrs the fruition of Senſe, namely the Conſcience, which hath often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a contrary motion, and checks the inferior Faculties of Senſe, even when it oftentimes cannot control it, it chides and allays the contentation of ſenſual Delights; ſo that even in Laughter the Heart is ſorrowful: but the Brutes have no ſuch correction of their Delights in fruition of Senſe, but are entire in their enjoyments.</p>
               <p>Again, it is a great perfection of the Humane Nature, that it hath a more fixed, ſtrong, and compact memory of things paſt than the Brutes have: A Brute forgets his fruitions when they are paſt, hath not the ſenſe, much leſs the memory of any faults or follies committed by him; and therefore his preſent fruitions are not ſowred with the remembrance of thoſe better ſeaſons of delight that he once had: But Man hath ever a remembrance of what is paſt, he remembers his faults and follies, and what ſenſible advantages he loſt by this or that inadvertence, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, or folly; if his proſperity or fruition were formerly greater, it depreciates his preſent enjoyment: ſo that the excellence of his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Faculties makes his preſent enjoyment faint, weak, and taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>Again, Man hath a more exquiſite ſenſe of preſent incumbent evils than the Beaſts have: as his fruition of the ſenſible Good he enjoys is not ſo entire as the Beaſts, ſo his ſenſe of any incumbent evil is more ſharp, quick, and galling than that of the Beaſts, and thereby his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſenſible contentations are ſowred and allayed. When <hi>Haman</hi> had all the ſenſible Honours, Wealth, Affluence, that the Court of the greateſt Monarch in the World could yield him, yet the want of a bow from <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſowred all his enjoyments, and made him ſick for the want of it. And when <hi>Ahab</hi> had all the Honours and Proviſions that a Kingdom could afford him, yet the want of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s little Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard rendred all his enjoyments taſtleſs. And this Conſideration is eaſily improveable, if we conſider that the very ſtate and condition of our ſenſible Life hath many more diſtaſtful and ſharp ingredients than the brutal Life hath; and the greateſt ſenſual Contentments in Man are commonly haunted with more than one of theſe diſpleaſing Gueſts: The Beaſts have no ſenſe of reproach, diſhonour, diſgrace, which yet ſit
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:64147:192"/>
cloſe upon Men, eſpecially of great Spirits and Enjoyments. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and Diſtempers in Man are ten to one more in number, and ſharper or longer than in Beaſts: and any of theſe render the beſt ſenſual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments either taſtleſs or vexing.</p>
               <p>Again, and moſt principally of all the reſt, the Brutes have little proſpect to the future, if any at all; their proviſions for things to come, as for the Winter, for their Young, and the like, ſeem not ſo much acts of diſtinct knowledge or foreſight of the future, as certain conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inſtincts alligated to their nature by the wiſe and intelligent diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their moſt wiſe Creator. And hence it is, that they have no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration or fear of death till they feel it; and if they have a good Paſture at preſent, they are not ſolicitous how long it will laſt, or what they ſhall do after: they are not tormented with fears of what may come, becauſe they have no anticipations or ſuſpitions of what may be in the future; and by this means their enjoyments are ſincere, unallayed with fears or ſuſpitions, they fear not death, becauſe they are not ſenſible of their own mortality till they feel themſelves dying: But the caſe is quite otherwiſe with Man, the excellency of his Faculties, and the impreſſion of Experience and Obſervation gives him a foreſight of many things that will come, and a ſtrong ſuſpition of many more that may come; and by this means he anticipates Miſeries, and becomes twice miſerable: firſt, in fears, pre-apprehenſions, and anticipation, and then again in the actual undergoing of it; and if thoſe ſuſpected and feared evils never overtake him, yet he is equally if not more miſerable than if they did: For his pre-apprehenſions and ſuſpitions renders them as ſharp as if they were felt, and many times ſharper, by the appoſition of the moſt hideous and aggravating circumſtances that his thoughts and fears can faſhion. And this very advantage of anticipation and foreſight, which is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and excellence in Man above the Brutes, ſaddens his Joy, galls and frets his ſenſual Contentment, and upon the very account of his own excellency and perfection renders the fruition of a ſenſible good utterly incompetible to be that end of fruition which the wiſe God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for him: Thus when he hath Wealth and Plenty he is under a thouſand cares and fears, ſometimes of falſe Accuſers, ſometimes of Thieves and Robbers, ſometimes of Fire and Caſualty; and while he is rich and plentiful in fruition, he is poor and miſerable by anticipation: If he be in Health and Strength, whereby ſenſual Goods have their proper guſt and reliſh with him, yet he is under the fear of Sickneſs, Pain, and Diſcompoſure, which fear renders the Diſeaſe in a manner preſent before it comes, and ſo gives a diſtaſt and diſreliſh to even his preſent fruition.</p>
               <p>And now if it be ſaid, That as this ſagacity and foreſight ſometimes gives a diſadvantage under Enjoyments by the Paſſion of Fear, ſo it makes an amends under ſenſible Inconveniences by the Affection of Hope: I anſwer, It is true, it doth make ſome amends, but yet it is not anſwerable.</p>
               <p>For firſt, the anticipations of Fear are ever more vigorous than the anticipations of Hope. 2. The objects, means, and occaſions of our fears in relation to ſenſuals, are ever more and greater than the objects of our hopes; becauſe we are obnoxious more to dangers, and thoſe of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:64147:193"/>
divers kinds, than we are to deliverances and recoveries from ſenſible evils. 3. But that which is <hi>inſtar omnium</hi> is this; Death puts a period to all ſenſual Comforts, and this Death is certain will overtake us, and we know not how ſoon; and this foreſight of Death is a certain fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and a continual object of certain fear. And this fear of Death, and the anticipation thereof is always preſent with us, and we cannot deliver our ſelves from the fear and foreſight of it, no more than we can deliver our ſelves from the thing it ſelf; and commonly the antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and fear of Death is more terrible, and dreſſed up in a more hideous proſpect than Death it ſelf. And this one proviſion and antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Death, is that which makes all ſenſual Goods utterly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible to be a ſuitable end of fruition to a Man, upon theſe two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that this preſenſation and anticipation of Death doth ſadly allay all ſenſible enjoyments, makes them weak, and renders them ungrateful. The Expreſſion is excellent, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Who through fear of death were all their life time ſubject to bondage:</hi> the delicacies of a Man in Bondage loſe their taſt and reliſh. Again ſecondly, it preſents all our enjoyments as determined or determinable in a ſhort time, which takes off the value of any ſenſible enjoyment. It muſt needs be, that ſenſual enjoyment muſt be abated, when he that enjoys it doth in the very enjoyment thereof know it muſt not laſt long: a Beaſt enjoys his full Paſture with greater contentment, that yet ſhall be taken from him, or he from it to morrow; than any Man can enjoy the ſweeteſt Proviſion for his Senſe, while he is under the actual ſenſe that he muſt dye to morrow. The advantage of the anticipation of Death is that which renders it impoſſible that a ſenſual good can be the ultimate good of fruition to Man, ſince it is by that very advantage rendred a leſs good to him than to the Beaſts that periſh.</p>
               <p>The Proof of the Immortality of the Soul of Man belongs to ſome of the following Diſcourſes, I ſhall not now launch out into that Deep. But to me this very Conſideration, that the very excellence of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faculties, eſpecially that whereby he hath a proſpect and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate anticipation of Death, renders the good of Senſe leſs good, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and pleaſant to this excellent Creature Man than it is to the very brute Beaſts; hath been a ſtrong Moral Evidence, that there is an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul in Man, for which an immortal Good is reſerved: Becauſe it ſeems not ſuitable with Divine Wiſdom and Oeconomy, that the Brutes ſhould have a greater felicity than Man; yet ſo it muſt be, if the end of Man's fruition were only a ſenſible Good, or a Good ſuited only to the Life of Senſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And ſurely if the good of Senſe be not the adequate end of humane fruition, then much leſs can thoſe things be the end of fruition intended for Man, which are but proviſional and ſubſervient only to the good of Senſe; and ſuch are Honours, Grandeur, Power, and Wealth, they are but ſo many ſubſervients to the acquiring or performing of the good of Senſe, or the fruition of a ſenſible Life to him that hath them, and therefore lower and leſs valuable than thoſe things for whoſe ſake and uſe they ſerve.</p>
               <p>And thus far I have gone in the Negative, whereby I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to evince that the good of Senſe, the fruition of thoſe good
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:64147:193"/>
things that ſerve for a ſenſible Life, Meat, Drink, Clothing, the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Delights of the Senſes, the expletion of the Faculties of the Senſible Nature; their motions are not the peculiar end of fruition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the wiſe God to the Intellectual Nature of Man. I come to conſider it Poſitively, That there is an end of Fruition, and what we may reaſonably conjecture it may be.</p>
               <p>That Man was created for an end of fruition appears, 1. From the nature of the Efficient: It is, as before is obſerved, the property of every intelligent and wiſe Efficient in all his Works and Actions to intend an End, and an end ſuitable to the value of the work, but that is not always an end of fruition to the work it ſelf; it is ſufficient, that there is an end in the work: Many times a wiſe Agent produceth a work or effect in order to ſomething elſe, an inſtrument ſubſervient to ſome other thing; and thus he might have made Man only to ſerve, glorifie, and honour his Maker, as a Man makes a Saw or a Watch as an Inſtrument for his own uſe, without any communication of a Good of fruition to the thing thus made. But as Almighty God is a moſt wiſe Efficient, ſo he is a moſt benign and bountiful Efficient; He made all things not only for the glory of his Wiſdom, but for the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Goodneſs to the things He thus made, according to the meaſure and capacity of their participation. He made the inferior Animals for the glory of his Wiſdom and Power, and for the ſervice of Man, and yet he communicated to them ſo much of fruition and enjoyment, and of ſuch a Good as was ſuitable to their nature, namely, a ſenſible Good. There is not the meaneſt Inſect in the World but hath a Good of fruition proportionate to its nature, namely, of a ſenſible Good in which it delights, and which it endeavours to preſerve. And thus as the Wiſdom of this great Efficient made Man the moſt excellent of Viſible Natures, for an end, and ſuch an end as was ſuitable to the excellence of the Nature he thus made, namely, actively to ſerve and glorifie his Maker; ſo the Goodneſs and Beneficence of this bountiful Efficient deſigned an end of fruition to this Creature, and deſigned unto him alſo ſuch a fruition, and of ſuch a good as is proportionate to the excellence of that Nature he thus made: And otherwiſe he ſhould have been proportionally leſs beneficent to the nobleſt of ſublunary Creatures, than he is to the meaneſt of living Animals, which together with the end deſigned in them <hi>in ordine ad aliud,</hi> have an end of fruition of ſuch a Good as is proportionate to their being, nature, and capacity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as thus the contemplation of the Efficient, and his Beneficence to other created Beings, induceth us to conclude an end of fruition deſigned to Man, ſo the contemplation of the Work it ſelf concludes the ſame. Man hath in the peculiarity of his nature theſe two great Powers and receptive Faculties, whereby he is rendred amply capable of a great enjoyment, namely his Underſtanding, whoſe proper Object is Truth, and the nobleſt Truth that is, and its proper action is directed to that Object, namely, Intellection and Will, whoſe proper Object is [Good,] and the greater and more ſovereign the Good is, the more ſuitable it is to this power, and the proper act of this power is to reach after, and deſire, and embrace, and delight in its Object: and the filling of theſe two receptive powers with the chiefeſt intellectual Truth, and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:64147:194"/>
with the chiefeſt and intellectual Good, is that which perfects, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, and enableth theſe Faculties or Powers.</p>
               <p>And this doth lead us to a juſt diſcovery of what that end of fruition is, for which Man was deſigned by his beneficent Creator, namely, ſuch as is ſuitable, anſwerable, and proportionate to thoſe Powers or Faculties in Man whereby he excells all inferior Animals, his Underſtanding and his Will; and herein conſiſts his happineſs, his end of fruition or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to his Underſtanding, the great and general fruition of Good therein is Knowledge: Now I ſhall diſtinguiſh theſe Objects of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or <hi>Scibilia</hi> into two kinds; 1. The <hi>Scibilia ſubordinata,</hi> which being united to the intellective Power by that act or habit which we call Knowledge, do advance and perfect this Power or Faculty in a ſubordinate way, meaſure, or degree; ſuch is the knowledge of Natural Cauſes and Effects of Arts Liberal or Manual, of Rules of <hi>juſtum</hi> and <hi>decorum,</hi> of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Truths, and the like: this gives a ſubordinate perfection and fruition to this Power varied and diverſified according to the worth of the Objects, and the perfection or clearneſs of their perception. 2. The <hi>Scibile ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> which is the ever-glorious God, his Perfection, Attributes, Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, his Will, and Commands, ſo far forth as that infinitely perfect Being is cognoſcible by our finite Underſtanding: This is the ſupreme Truth, the higheſt fruition of the intellective Power, and the greateſt perfection of an intellective Nature as ſuch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, as to the power of the Will, it hath likewiſe Objects of Good anſwerable to the former diſtribution. 1. The ſubordinate Good of Moral Virtues, Honeſty, Sobriety, Juſtice, Temperance, and all the train of Moral Virtues; theſe being united to the Will in their acts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant habits, the Will enjoys a great Moral Good, tranquillity of Mind, complacency and delight. 2. The Sovereign Good, which is the glorious God, reached after by the Will as the chiefeſt Good, and enjoyed in the manifeſtations of his Love, Favour, Preſence, Influence, and Beneficence: this fills the vaſteſt motions of the Will, fills it with Peace, Contentation, and Glory, and keeps it nevertheleſs in a perpetual motion, by returns of Gratitude, humble Love, Obedience, and all imaginable extenſion of it ſelf for the Service, Honour, and Glory of that God that hath thus boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully given to the Soul a power in ſome meaſure receptive of his Infinite Self, and fitted that power with a proportionate Good, even the Goodneſs and Bounty of the ever-glorious God.</p>
               <p>And now becauſe Man hath a double ſtate, namely, a ſtate in this Life in conjunction of the Soul with the Body, naturally diſſolvible, and a ſtate of Immortality after this Life, either in the Soul alone, or in the Soul in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with an immortal Body, as ſhall be ſhewn in its due time: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proportionable to this double ſtate is that fruition which Almighty God deſigned for his End.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this Life, the proportionable fruition of Man is that which is compatible to the ſtate he hath here, namely, the knowledge of God and his Works in a meaſure ſuitable to the intellectual Capacity in this Life, the ſenſe of the Divine Love, Favour, Goodneſs, and Protection, the ſenſe of his own Duty to God, to Man, to himſelf, with a cheerful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obſerve it: And from theſe ariſe dominion over his Paſſions and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:64147:194"/>
inferior Faculties, and the due placing, ordering, and moderation of them; a reſignation of his Will to the Divine Will, and a dependance upon his Goodneſs, Power, and All-ſufficiency: and from all theſe ariſe peace of Conſcience, contentation and tranquillity of Mind, in which even the wiſeſt of Heathens placed the greateſt Happineſs acquirable in this Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After this Life an immutable ſtate of everlaſting Reſt and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Beatifical Viſion of God, and fruition of ſo much of his Goodneſs and Beneficence as a glorified Soul is capable of: for it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that the end of fruition of an Immortal Nature ſhould be an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Good, commenſurate in its intention and duration to ſuch an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Nature.</p>
               <p>And now if any Man ſhall enquire if this be the End of Almighty God in the Creation of Man, How comes it to paſs that all Men attain not this End, or how comes it to paſs that Almighty God comes to be fruſtrated of the End which he thus deſigned, as well in relation to his own Glory, as the Good of Mankind?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, firſt in general, That this Enquiry belongs to another way of Examination, namely, herein we muſt have the aſſiſtance of Divine Revelation, both to anſwer this Enquiry and to guide us in it, which in this place is not deſigned to be proſecuted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet more particularly thus much I ſhall ſay, 1. That the wiſe God hath as it were twiſted his own Honour and Glory with Man's Felicity and Happineſs; if Man decline to honour, glorifie, love, and obey his Maker, and caſts off the primary and chief End of his Being, it is juſt and neceſſary that he be deprived of the End of his own Fruition and Happineſs, which is the Reward of his Duty. 2. The Liberty of the Will was the great Prerogative of the Humane Nature, and Almighty God having furniſhed that Nature with all conducibles to enable him to obey, and to continue him in that Obedience, Man by the abuſe of his own liberty deprived himſelf of his own felicity: When we ſpeak there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the End of Man we ſpeak of it as God made him, not as Man made, or rather unmade himſelf.</p>
               <p>But of this End of the means of his Reſtitution by Chriſt, and the admirable Syſtem and Connexion of the Divine Providence in relation to Man in his Redemption, belongs to another Diſcourſe: We are in this preceding Diſcourſe but in the outward Court of the Temple, where the Gentiles came, or might come by natural Light or Ratiocination.</p>
               <p>Therefore to conclude all,</p>
               <p>Almighty God out of his abundant Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence as he hath made Mankind, ſo he hath fitted him for a double End, namely, to glorifie his Maker, and everlaſtingly to enjoy him, and in order hereunto hath given him a double ſtation, and in each of theſe a differing kind of fruition of his Maker, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſtation in this lower World, and a ſtation in the glorious Heavens.</p>
               <p>His ſtation in this lower World, is during the time of his mortal Life here below; and in this ſtation the glorious God hath furniſhed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind with all conveniencics and accommodations ſuitable to it, as the comfortable Accommodations of his ſenſible Life, the Comforts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, the Uſe and Dominion of his Creatures, the admirable Faculties of his Mind, the Books and Inſtructions of his Word and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:64147:195"/>
Will, the goodly Works of Creation and Providence, the Tenders and Ayders of his Grace and Guidance, the Effluxes and Manifeſtations of his Favours and Love, the Anticipations and Hopes of Eternal Happineſs; theſe and many more ſuch as theſe, the Bountiful God affords to Mankind, even in this ſtate of Mortality, which may and do render it in a great meaſure very comfortable.</p>
               <p>But withall he lets us know, and we muſt know, That theſe are but as ſo many Bounties to render our paſſage through this Life the more eaſie and convenient to our ſelves, and the more ſerviceable to our great Lord and Maſter: This is not to be the place of our reſt or final happineſs, but a place of exerciſe and probation, a place of preparation for our future and more durable ſtate; we are here as it were but put to School to learn our Duty and our Leſſons, we are but as young Plants planted in a Nurſery, till we come to a convenient ſize and fitneſs to be removed, and then we are to be tranſplanted into another and a richer Soil. In this World we are as it were Seeds ripening upon the Trees or Stalks till they are fully digeſted and ripe, and then as the Seeds drop into the Ground and become the Seminary of a new Plantation: ſo by Death we drop into Eternity, and become the Children, the <hi>Embryones</hi> of the Reſurrection, and then we come into that ſecond and bleſſed ſtation, the Country of our Reſt and Happineſs, our Home, and the End of our Being; where we ſhall ever behold the Glory of the Glorious God, and glorifie him for ever; where we ſhall have the perpetual, ſenſible, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, ſatisfactory Manifeſtation and Influences of his Love to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and enjoy that Bleſſedneſs which Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath entred into the Heart of Man to conceive: And this is the great End of the Glorious God in making this great goodly Creature called Man, whoſe Body is but the Husk, the Shell of that vital, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Beam of Light, Life, and Immortality, that Seminal Principle of Eternal Life, the Soul, irradiated and influenced by the Sacred Spirit of Life and Love, and if God lend me Life and Strength, ſhall in my next be handled.</p>
