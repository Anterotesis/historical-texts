            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

dwelling in the boundes of <hi>Lowthian,</hi>
which is a principall shire or parte of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
where the Kings Maiestie vseth to make his

their detestable wickednes which they priuilye
had pretended against the Kings Maiestie, the
Common-weale of that Country, with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
and subiects of the same, should come to

to make knowne vnto the worlde, that their
actions were contrarye to the lawe of God, and
the naturall affection which we ought general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
to beare one to another: the manner of the
reuealing wherof was as followeth.</p>
            <p>Within the towne of <hi>Trenent</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there dwelleth one <hi>Dauid Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
who being deputie Bailiffe in the saide
Towne, had a maide seruant called <hi>Geillis Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane,</hi>
who vsed secretly to be absent and to lye
foorth of her Maisters house euery other night:
this <hi>Geillis Duncane</hi> took in hand to help all such
as were troubled or greeued with any kinde of
sicknes or infirmitie: and in short space did
perfourme manye matters most miraculous,
which thinges forasmuch as she began to doe
them vpon a sodaine, hauing neuer doon the like
<pb facs="tcp:21332:4"/>
before, made her Maister and others to be in
great admiracion, and wondred thereat: by
meanes wherof the saide <hi>Dauid Seaton</hi> had his
maide in some great suspition, that she did not
those things by naturall and lawfull wayes, but
rather supposed it to be doone by some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and vnlawfull meanes.</p>
            <p>Whervpon, her Maister began to growe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inquisitiue, and examined her which way and
by what meanes she were able to perfourme
matters of so great importance: whereat she
gaue him no answere, neuerthelesse, her Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to the intent that he might the better trye
and finde out the trueth of the same, did with the
helpe of others, torment her with the torture of
the Pilliwinckes vpon her fingers, which is a
greeuous torture, and binding or wrinching her
head with a corde or roape, which is a most cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
torment also, yet would she not confesse any
thing, whereupon they suspecting that she had
beene marked by the Diuell (as commonly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are) made dilligent search about her, and
found the enemies marke to be in her fore crag
or foreparte of her throate: which being found,
she confessed that all her dooings was doone by
the wicked allurements and inticements of the
Diuell, and that she did them by witchcraft.</p>
            <p>After this her confession, she was committed
to prison, wheee she continued for a season,
<pb facs="tcp:21332:5"/>
where immediatly she accused these persons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
to be notorious witches, and caused
them foorthwith to be apprehended one after an
<figure/>
other, vidz. <hi>Agnis Sampson</hi> the eldest Witch of
them al, dwelling in Haddington, <hi>Agnes Tomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
of Edenbrough, Doctor <hi>Fian, alias Iohn
Cunningham,</hi> maister of the Schoole at Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pans
<pb facs="tcp:21332:5"/>
in Lowthian, of whose life and strange
actes, you shall heare more largely in the ende of
this discourse: these were by the saide <hi>Geillis

dwelling in Saltpans, <hi>Robert Griersonn</hi> skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and <hi>Iennit Bandilandis,</hi> with the Porters
wife of Seaton, the Smith at the brigge Hallis
with innumerable others in that partes, and
dwelling in those bounds aforesaide: of whom
some are alreadye executed, the rest remaine in
prison, to receiue the doome of Iudgement at the
Kings maiesties will and pleasure.</p>
            <p>The said <hi>Geillis Duncane</hi> also caused <hi>Ewpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Meealrean</hi> to be apprehended, who conspired
and perfourmed the death of her Godfather, and
who vsed her art vpon a gentleman being one
of the Lords and Iustices of the Session, for
bearing good will to her Daughter: she also cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be apprehended one <hi>Barbara Naper,</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
to death <hi>Archibalde,</hi> last Earle of
Angus, who languished to death by withcraft
and yet the same was not suspected, but that he
died of so strange a disease, as the Phisition
knew not how to cure or remedy the same: but
of all other the saide witches, these two last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
recited, were reputed for as ciuill honest
women as any that dwelled within the Citie of
Edenbrough, before they were apprehended.
Many other besides were taken dwelling in
<pb facs="tcp:21332:6"/>
Lieth, who are detayned in prison, vntill his
Maiesties further will and pleasure be knowne
of whose wicked dooings you shall particularly
heare, which was as followeth.</p>
            <p>This aforesaid <hi>Agnis Sampson</hi> which was
the elder Witch, was taken and brought to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liriud
house before the Kings Maiestie and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
other of the nobility of Scotland, where she
was straitly examined, but all the perswasions
which the Kings maiestie vsed to her with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest
of his counsell, might not prouoke or induce her
to confesse any thing, but stood stiffely in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
of all that was laide to her charge: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
they caused her to be conueied awaye to
prison, there to receiue such torture as hath been
lately prouided for witches in that country: and
forasmuch as by due examination of witchcraft
and witches in Scotland, it hath latelye beene
found that the Deuill dooth generallye marke
them with a priuie marke, by reason the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
haue confessed themselues, that the Diuell
dooth lick them with his tung in some priuy part
of their bodie, before hee dooth receiue them
to be his seruants, which marke commonly is
giuen them vnder the haire in some part of their
bodye, wherby it may not easily be found out or
seene, although they be searched: and generally
so long as the marke is not seene to those which
search them, so long the parties that hath the
<pb facs="tcp:21332:6"/>
marke will neuer confesse any thing. Therfore
by special commaundement this <hi>Agnis Sampson</hi>
had all her haire shauen of, in eache parte of her
bodie, and her head thrawen with a rope accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the custome of that Countrye, beeing a
paine most greeuous, which she continued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
an hower, during which time she would
not confesse any thing vntill the Diuels marke
was found vpon her priuities, then she immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atlye
confessed whatsoeuer was demaunded of
her, and iustifying those persons aforesaid to be
notorious witches.</p>
            <p>Item, the saide <hi>Agnis Tompson</hi> was after
brought againe before the Kings Maiestie and
his Counsell, and being examined of the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and detestable dealings of those witches,
she confessed that vpon the night of <hi>Allhollon</hi>
Euen last, she was accompanied aswell with
the persons aforesaide, as also with a great
many other witches, to the number of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth:
and that all they together went by Sea
each one in a Riddle or Ciue, and went in the
same very substantially with Flaggons of wine
making merrie and drinking by the waye in the
same Riddles or Ciues, to the kerke of North
Barrick in Lowthian, and that after they had
landed, tooke handes on the land and daunced
this reill or short daunce, singing all with one
voice.</p>

            <p>At which time she confessed, that this <hi>Geilles
Duncane</hi> did goe before them playing this reill
ordaunce vpon a small Trump, called a Iewes
Trump, vntill they entred into the Kerk of north
Barrick.</p>
            <p>These confessions made the King in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
admiration, and sent for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said <hi>Geillis Dun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cane,</hi>
who vpon the like Trump did playe the
said daunce before the Kings Maiestie, who in
respect of the strangenes of these matters, tooke
great delight to bee present at their examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Item, the said <hi>Agnis Tompson</hi> confessed that
the Diuell being then at North Barrick Kerke
attending their comming in the habit or likenes
of a man, and seeing that they tarried ouer-long,
he at their comming enioyned them all to a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which was, that they should kisse his
Buttockes, in signe of duetye to him: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put ouer the Pulpit barre, euerye one did as
he had enioyned them: and hauing made his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
exhortations, wherein he did greatlye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighe
against the King of Scotlond, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
their oathes for their good and true seruice
towards him, and departed: which doone, they
returned to Sea, and so home againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21332:7"/>
At which time the witches demaunded of the
Diuel why he did beare such hatred to the King,
who answered, by reason the King is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
enemy he hath in the worlde: all which their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nfessions and depositions are still extant vpon
record.</p>
            <p>Item, the saide <hi>Agnis Sampson</hi> confessed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Kings Maiestie sundrye thinges which
were so miraculous and strange, as that his
Maiestie saide they were all extreame lyars,
wherat she answered, she would not wishe his
Maiestie to suppose her woords to be false, but
rather to beleeue them, in that she would disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
such matter vnto him as his maiestie should
not any way doubt off.</p>
            <p>And therupon taking his Maiestie a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
she declared vnto him the verye woordes
which passed betweene the Kings Maiestie and
his Queene at Upslo in Norway the first night
of their mariage, with their answere eache to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
whereat the Kinges Maiestie wondered
greatlye, and swore by the liuing God, that he
beleeued that all the Diuels in hell could not
haue discouered the same: acknowledging her
woords to be most true, and therefore gaue the
more credit to the rest which is before declared.</p>
            <p>Touching this <hi>Agnis Tompson,</hi> she is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
woman, who by the Diuels perswasion
should haue entended and put in execution the
<pb facs="tcp:21332:8"/>
Kings Maiesties death in this manner.</p>
            <p>She confessed that she tooke a blacke Toade,
and did hang the same vp by the heeles, three
daies, and collected and gathered the venome as
it dropped and fell from it in an Oister shell, and
kept the same venome close couered, vntill she
should obtaine any parte or peece of foule linnen
cloth, that had appertained to the Kings Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
and shirt, handkercher, napkin or any other
thing which she practised to obtaine by meanes
of one <hi>Iohn Kers,</hi> who being attendant in his
Maiesties Chamber, desired him for olde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
betweene them, to helpe her to one
or a peece of such a cloth as is aforesaide, which
thing the said <hi>Iohn Kers</hi> denyed to helpe her too,
saying he could not help her too it.</p>
            <p>And the said <hi>Agnis Tompson</hi> by her depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
since her apprehension saith, that if she had
obtained any one peece of linnes cloth which the
King had worne and fouled, she had bewitched
him to death, and put him to such extraordinary
paines, as if he had beene lying vpon sharp thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and endes of Needles.</p>
            <p>Moreouer she confessed that at the time when
his Maiestie was in Denmarke, she being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the parties before specially na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
tooke a Cat and christened it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bound to each parte of that Cat, the chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
partes of a dead man, and seuerall ioynes of
<pb facs="tcp:21332:8"/>
his bodies, and that in the night following the
saide Cat was conueied into the midst of the sea
by all these witches sayling in their riddles or
Ciues as is aforesaide, and so left the saide Cat
right before the Towne of Lieth in Scotland:
this doone, there did arise such a tempest in the
Sea, as a greater hath not beene seene: which
tempest was the cause of the perrishing of a
Boate or vessell comming ouer from the towne
of Brunt Iland to the towne of Lieth, wherein
was sundrye Iewelles and riche giftes, which
should haue been presented to the now Queen of
Scotland, at her Maiesties comming to Lieth.</p>
            <p>Againe it is confessed, that the said christened
Cat was the cause that the Kinges Maiesties
Ship at his comming foorth of Denmarke, had
a contrary winde to the rest of his Ships, then
being in his companye, which thing was most
strange and true, as the Kings Maiestie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth,
for when the rest of the Shippes
had a faire and good winde, then was the winde
contrarye and altogither against his Maiestie:
and further the saide witche declared, that his
Maiestie had neuer come safelye from the Sea,
if his faith had not preuailed aboue their enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Moreouer the said Witches being demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:21332:9"/>
how the Diuell would vse them when he
was in their company, they confessed that when
the Diuell did receiue them for his seruants, and
that they had vowed themselues vnto him, then
he would Carnallye vse them, albeit to their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pleasure, in respect of his colde nature: and
would doo the like at sundry other times.</p>
            <p>As touching the aforesaide Doctor <hi>Fian, alias
Iohn Cunningham,</hi> the examination of his actes
since his apprehension, declareth the great sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltye
of the diuell, and therfore maketh thinges
to appeere the more miraculous: for being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by the accusation of the saide <hi>Geillis
Duncane</hi> aforesaide, who confessed he was their
Regester, and that there was not one man suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to come to the Diuels readinges but onlye
he: the saide Doctor was taken and imprisoned,
and vsed with the accustomed paine, prouided
for those offences, inflicted vpon the rest as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaide.</p>
            <p>First by thrawing of his head with a roape,
wherat he would confesse nothing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he was perswaded by faire means
to confesse his follies, but that would preuaile
as little.</p>
            <p>Lastly he was put to the most seuere and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
paine in the world, called the bootes, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:21332:9"/>
he had receiued three strokes, being enquired
if he would confesse his damnable acts and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
life, his tung would not serue him to speak,
in respect wherof the rest of the witches willed
to search his tung, vnder which was found two
pinnes thrust vp into the head, whereupon
the UUitches did laye, <hi>Now is the Charme
stinted,</hi> and shewed that those charmed Pinnes
were the cause he could not confesse any thing:
then was he immediatly released of the bootes,
brought before the King, his confession was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and his owne hand willingly set ther-vnto,
which contained as followeth.</p>
            <p>First, that at the generall meetinges of those
witches, hee was alwayes preasent: that he
was Clarke to all those that were in subiection
to the Diuels seruice, bearing the name of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that alwaye he did take their othes for
their true seruice to the Diuell, and that he wrot
for them such matters as the Diuell still pleased
to commaund him.</p>
            <p>Item, he confessed that by his witchcrafte he
did be witch a Gentleman dwelling neere to the
Saltpans, where the said Doctor kept Schoole,
onely for being enamoured of a Gentlewoman
whome he loued himselfe: by meanes of which
<pb facs="tcp:21332:10"/>
his Sorcerye, witchcraft and diuelish practises,
he caused the said Gentleman that once in xxiiij.
howres he fell into a lunacie and madnes, and so
<figure/>
cotinued one whole hower together, and for the
veritie of the same, he caused the Gentleman to
be brought before the Kinges Maiestie, which
was vpon the xxiiij. day of December last, and
<pb facs="tcp:21332:10"/>
in his Maiesties Chamber, suddenly he gaue a
great scritch and fell into a madnes, sometime
bending himselfe, and sometime capring so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
vp, that his head did touch the feeling of the
Chamber, to the great admiration of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
and others then present: so that all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
in the Chamber were not able to holde
him, vntill they called in more helpe, who toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bound him hand and foot: and suffering the
said gentleman to lye still vntill his furye were
past, he within an hower came againe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
when being demaunded of the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
what he saw or did all that while, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he had been in a sound sleepe.</p>
            <p>Item the said Doctor did also confesse that he
had vsed means sundry times to obtain his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and wicked intent of the same Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and seeing himselfe disapointed of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
he determined by all waies he might to
obtaine the same, trusting by coniuring, witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
and Sorcery to obtaine it in this manner.</p>
            <p>It happened this gentlewoman being vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
had a brother who went to schoole with the
said Doctor, and calling his Scholler to him,
demaunded if he did lye with his sister, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
he did, by meanes wherof he thought to
obtaine his purpose, and therefore secretlye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to teach him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out stripes, so he would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
for him three haires of his sisters priuities.
<pb facs="tcp:21332:11"/>
at such time as he should spye best occasion for
it: which the youth promised faithfullye to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme,
and vowed speedily to put it in practise,
taking a peece of coniured paper of his maister
to lappe them in when he had gotten them: and
there vpon the boye practised nightlye to obtaine
his maisters purpose, especially when his sister
was a sleepe.</p>
            <p>But God who knoweth the secrets of all
harts, and reuealeth all wicked and vngodlye
practises, would not suffer the intents of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilish
Doctor to come to that purpose which he
supposed it would, and therefore to declare that
he was heauilye offended with his wicked en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
did so woorke by the Gentlewomans owne
meanes, that in the ende the same was discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and brought to light: for she being one night
a sleepe, and her brother in bed with her, sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
cryed out to her mother, declaring that her
Brother would not suffer her to sleepe, wherev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
her mother hauing a quick capacitie, did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
suspect Doctor <hi>Fians</hi> entention, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
she was a witche of her selfe, and therefore
presently arose, and was very inquisitiue of the
boy to vnderstand his intent, and the better to
know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, did beat him with sundry stripes,
wherby he discouered the trueth vnto her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21332:11"/>
The Mother therefore being well practised
in witchcrafte, did thinke it most conuenient
to meete with the Doctor in his owne Arte, and
therevpon tooke the paper from the boy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee should haue put the same haires, and
went to a young Heyfer which neuer had borne
Calfe nor gone to the Bull, and with a paire of
sheeres, clipped off three haires from the vd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Cow, and wrapt them in the same pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which she againe deliuered to the boy, then
willing him to giue the same to his saide Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
which he immediatly did.</p>
            <p>The Schoolemaister so soone as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
them, thinking them indeede to bee the
Maides haires, went straight and wrought
his arte vpon them: But the Doctor had no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
doone his intent to them, but presentlye the
Hayfer or Cow whose haires they were indeed,
came vnto the doore of the Church wherein
the Schoolemaister was, into the which the
Hayfer went, and made towards the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister,
leaping and dauncing vpon him, and
following him foorth of the church and to what
place so euer he went, to the great admiration
of all townes men of Saltpans, and many
other who did beholde the same.</p>
            <p>The reporte whereof made all men imagine
<pb facs="tcp:21332:12"/>
that hee did woorke it by the Diuell, without
whom it could neuer haue beene so sufficientlye
effected: and thervpon, the name of the said Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<hi>Fien</hi> (who was but a very yong man) began
to grow so common among the people of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
that he was secretlye nominated for a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Cuniurer.

               </gap> which although in the beginning he denied,
and would not confesse, yet hauing felt the pain of
the bootes (and the charme stinted, as aforesayd)
he confessed all the aforesaid to be most true, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
producing anie witnesses to iustifie the same,
&amp; thervpon before the kings maiesty he subscribed
the sayd confessions with his owne hande, which

            <p>After that the depositions and examinations
of the sayd doctor <hi>Fian Alias Cuningham</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
as alreadie is declared, with his owne hand
willingly set therevnto, hee was by the master of
the prison committed to ward, and appointed to
a chamber by himselfe, where forsaking his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wayes, acknowledging his most vngodly lyfe,
shewing that he had too much folowed the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

his conclusions by coniuring, witchcraft, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment,
sorcerie, and such like, hee renounced
the deuill and all his wicked workes, vowed to
leade the life of a Christian, and seemed newly
conuerted towards God.</p>
            <p>The morrow after vpon conference had with
him, he granted that the deuill had appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him in the night before, appareled all in blacke,
with a white wand in his hande, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
demaunded of him if hee would continue his
faithfull seruice, according to his first oath and

<pb facs="tcp:21332:13"/>
sayd) he vtterly renounced to his face, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayde

<hi>That once ere thou die thou shalt bee mine.</hi> And
with that (as he sayde) the deuill brake the white

            <p>Thus all the daie this Doctor <hi>Fian</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
verie solitarie, and seemed to haue care of his
owne soule, and would call vppon God, shewing
himselfe penitent for his wicked life, neuerthelesse
the same night hee founde such meanes, that hee
stole the key of the prison doore and chamber in
the which he was, which in the night hee opened
and fled awaie to the Salt pans, where hee was
alwayes resident, and first apprehended. Of
whose sodaine departure when the Kings maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
had intelligence, hee presently commanded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
inquirie to bee made for his apprehension,
and for the better effecting thereof, hee sent pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
proclamations into all partes of his lande
to the same effect. By meanes of whose hot and
harde pursuite, he was agayn taken and brought
to prison, and then being called before the kings
highnes, hee was reexamined as well touching
his departure, as also touching all that had before
happened.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21332:13"/>
But this Doctor, notwithstanding that his
owne confession appeareth remaining in recorde
vnder his owne hande writing, and the same
therevnto fixed in the presence of the Kings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
and sundrie of his Councell, yet did hee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
denie the same.</p>
            <p>Wherevpon the kinges maiestie perceiuing
his stubbourne wilfulnesse, conceiued and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that in the time of his absence hee had entered

his master, and that hee had beene agayne new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
marked, for the which hee was narrowly sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
but it coulde not in anie wise bee founde, yet
for more tryall of him to make him confesse, hee
was commaunded to haue a most strannge tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was done in this manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>His nailes vpon all his fingers were riuen and
pulled off with an instrument called in Scottish
a <hi>Turkas,</hi> which in England wee call a payre of

in two needles ouer euen vp to the heads. At all
which tormentes notwithstanding the Doctor
neuer shronke anie whit, neither woulde he then
confesse it the sooner for all the tortures inflicted
vpon him.</p>
            <p>Then was hee with all conuenient speed, by
commandement, conuaied againe to the torment
<pb facs="tcp:21332:14"/>
of the bootes, wherein hee continued a long

hee would not confess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> anie thing, so deepely had

               </gap>ecution of iustice vppon such detestable

a terrour to all others heereafter, that shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to deale in the lyke wicked and vngodlye
actions, as witchcraft, sorcery, cuniuration, &amp; such
lyke, the sayde Doctor <hi>Fian</hi> was soone after araig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
condemned, and adiudged by the law to die,
and then to bee burned according to the lawe of
that lande, prouided in that behalfe. Wherevpon
hee was put into a carte, and beeing first strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
hee was immediatly put into a great fire,
being readie prouided for that purpose, and there
<pb facs="tcp:21332:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
burned in the Castle hill of <hi>Edenbrough</hi> on asa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdaie

            <p>The rest of the witches which are not yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted,
remayne in prison till farther traill, and
knowledge of his maiesties pleasure.</p>
            <p>This strange discourse before recited, may perhaps
giue some occasion of doubt to such as shall happen to
reade the same, and thereby coniecture that the Kings
maiestie would not hazarde himselfe in the presence
of such notorious witches, least therby might haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
great danger to his person and the generall state
of the land, which thing in truth might wel haue bene
feared. But to answer generally to such, let this suffice:
that first it is well knowen that the King is the child &amp;
seruant of God, and they but seruants to the deuil, hee
is the Lords annointed, and they but vesselles of Gods
wrath: he is a true Christian, and trusteth in God, they
worse than Infidels, for they onely trust in the deuill,
who daily serue them, till he haue brought them to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
destruction. But heereby it seemeth that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
caried a magnanimious and vndanted mind, not
feared with their inchantmentes, but resolute in this,
that so long as God is with him, hee feareth not who
is against him. And trulie the whole scope of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
dooth so plainely laie open the wonderfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of the Almightie, that if he had not bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by his omnipotencie and power, his Highnes
had neuer returned aliue in his voiage fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Denmarke,
so that there is no doubt but God woulde as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him on the land as on the sea, where they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their damnable practise.</p>
