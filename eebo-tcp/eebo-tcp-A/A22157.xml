            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Proclamation declaring His Maiesties pleasure concerning Sir Walter Rawleigh, and those who aduentured with him.</head>
            <p>WHereas We gaue Licence to Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> Knight, and others of Our Subiects with him, to vndertake a Uoyage to the Countrey of <hi>Guyana,</hi> where they pretended great hopes and probabilities to make discouery of certaine Gold Mines, for the lawfull enriching of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and these Our Kingdoms: Wherein We did by expresse limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Caution restraine, and forbid them and euery of them, from attempting any Acte of hostility, wrong, or violence whatsoeuer, vpon any of the Territories, States, or Subiects of any forraine Princes, with whom Wee are in amitie: And more peculiarly of those of Our deare Brother the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in respect of his Dominions and Interests in that Continent.</p>
            <p>All which notwithstanding, We are since informed by a common fame, that they, or some of them haue, by an hostile inuasion of the Towne of <hi>S. Thome</hi> (being vnder the obedience of Our said deare Brother the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>) and by killing of diuers of the inhabitants therof, his Subiects, and after by sacking and burning of the said towne, (as much as in them for their owne parts lay) malitiously broken and infringed the Peace and Amitie, which hath beene so happily established, and so long inuiolably continued betweene Us and the Subiects of both our Crownes.</p>
            <p>Wee haue therefore held it fit, as appertaining neerely to Our Royall Iustice and Honor, eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones to make a publique declaration of Our owne vtter mislike and detestation of the said inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, and excesses, if any such haue beene by any of Our Subiects committed: And for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter detection and clearing of the very trueth of the said common fame, Wee doe heereby straitly charge and require all Our Subiects whatsoeuer, that haue any particular vnderstanding and notice therof, vpon their duety and alleagiance which they owe Us, immediately after publication of this Our pleasure, to repaire vnto some of Our Priuy Counsell, and to discouer and make knowne vnto them their whole knowledge and vnderstanding concerning the same, vnder paine of Our High displeasure and indignation; that Wee may thereupon proceede in Our Princely Iustice to the exemplary punishment and coertion of all such, as shal be conuicted and found guilty of so scandalous and enormous outrages.</p>
            <p>Giuen at Our Mannor of Greenwich, the ninth day of Iune, in the sixteenth yeere of Our Raigne of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the one and Fiftieth.</p>
            <p>God saue the King.</p>
