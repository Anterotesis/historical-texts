            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>William Penn's ANSWER TO JOHN FALDO's PRINTED CHALLENGE.</head>
            <p>IT would ſeem <hi>Strange,</hi> as well as <hi>Unreaſonable</hi> to me, that <hi>J. Faldo</hi> ſhould of all Times and Places chuſe the <hi>Barbican</hi> Meeting of the <hi>28th</hi> of the <hi>6th</hi> Month, ſo ſurreptitiouſly gotten and partially mannaged, to divulge his <hi>Challenge</hi> againſt me, did I not give off <hi>Wondering</hi> at the <hi>Injuſt Carriage</hi> of ſome men towards us.</p>
            <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> He could not but know, I was at a <hi>great Diſtance</hi> from the Place; that I had twice <hi>defended our Belief</hi> in Print againſt him; and that a <hi>conſiderable Book</hi> lieth at his Door unanſwered. To make then that <hi>Swagger</hi> in my Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and yet be <hi>Debtor</hi> to my Deſences; to come ten Miles to tell the World, he would do great Things againſt me, and when he had done, to print, and as I may ſay, ſpit in our Faces at our Entrance into the laſt <hi>Barbican-</hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before he had ſent me a Copy, or atleaſt to know of my Receipt of it, and Anſwer to it, who am as near a Neighbour to his Reſidence as the <hi>Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can-</hi>Meeting, I think cannot be reputed fair by Indifferent Perſons: How <hi>Unfair</hi> then is the Complaint, that he hath had no Anſwer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> Was I not then, and am I not ſtill engaged againſt other Perſons, and that moſtly about the ſame things? Why did he not ſend me word he intended to be there, and exhibit a Charge publickly againſt me? The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Cuſtom</hi> as to Common Right. Is this to prove <hi>Quakeriſm no Chriſtianity;</hi> or himſelf <hi>No Chriſtian?</hi> I cannot believe he did to me herein, as he would be done by.</p>
            <p>But that I may acquit my ſelf of that Duty incumbent on me <hi>for the Truth,</hi> I do hereby ſignifie, That inaſmuch as the Controverſie depending between <hi>T. H. &amp;c.</hi> and us, takes in the moſt of the Particulars of his Charge, we freely conſent, that he ſhould come in with them for a Share as <hi>Confederate</hi> in the ſame Work, and uſe his utmoſt Abilities to maintain his Accuſations; And if in any Thing his Charge is ſingular, we ſhall be ready to hear and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debate it at the ſame Meeting or Meetings, to avoid freſh and unneceſſary Conteſts, as much as juſtly may be: Though ſtill let it be remembred, theſe very Things are at large diſcourſed in my <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to him; our <hi>Faith</hi> relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his Unworthy <hi>Miſrepreſentations,</hi> and confirmed by <hi>Scripture, Reaſon,</hi> and a Cloud of Honourable Ancient and Modern <hi>Witneſſes.</hi>
