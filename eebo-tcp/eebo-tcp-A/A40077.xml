            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Right Reverend Father in God,
ROBERT,
Lord Bishop of
GLOUCESTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>LITTLE did I think, when I <hi>made</hi> these
plain <hi>Sermons</hi> of <hi>Offences,</hi> that <hi>they</hi>
would have <hi>made me,</hi> in any Place
within His Majestie's Dominions, so
High an <hi>Offender,</hi> as the <hi>former</hi> of them <hi>hath,</hi>
in <hi>your City.</hi> But whether the Offence that is
so <hi>strangely</hi> expressed, and <hi>without President</hi>
(of which way of doing it, I thank the <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
heartily, for being the <hi>first</hi> Publisher) be Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<hi>given</hi> or merely <hi>taken,</hi> I leave it to your
Lordship to judge, when you have given your self
the trouble of reading it over, together with the
<hi>Second</hi> part on the same Subject. And it is the
<pb facs="tcp:49332:3"/>
onely favour, I have <hi>now</hi> to beg of your Lordship,
that you would give your self this <hi>little</hi> trouble.
I wish your Lordship had been present at the
<hi>Hearing</hi> of these Sermons, which if you had, you
had <hi>heard</hi> every syllable of what I took the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to deliver in your Absence.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, <hi>your Lordship</hi> hath had as Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Representations made of the Sermon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
the Act of <hi>Common Council,</hi> as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
were sent to the <hi>Observator:</hi> And, no doubt,
a no whit better Character of the <hi>second</hi> had been
given you (for I am sure it <hi>deserves</hi> no better)
had not those that were offended, obliged themselves
to be out of the Hearing of it, by that sudden Act of
theirs, the very next day after the <hi>first</hi> was preach'd.
I solemnly profess to your Lordship, that this whole
Discourse is neither better nor worse in <hi>Print,</hi> than
it was in the <hi>Preaching;</hi> Each part of it being
published, without the <hi>least</hi> Addition, Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Alteration, of any thing. So that by this
most <hi>fair Play,</hi> the <hi>Act-Makers</hi> have all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
imaginable given them, of going a much
<hi>more Terrible</hi> way to work with me, if any thing
either Seditious or Factious be to be found in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these Sermons. And I assure you Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
there is as much such Stuff in <hi>these,</hi> as in
any I ever preached, either in <hi>Gloucester,</hi> or else
<pb facs="tcp:49332:3"/>
where in my whole Life. And therefore, if your
Lordship shall find me guilty of any such Crimes,
I need not put you in mind that you can doe no
less, than procure to the COVNTENANCER
of SEDITION and FACTION, or (which is the
same thing, without <hi>mincing</hi> the matter, like these
modest Gentlemen) to the <hi>Seditious</hi> and <hi>Factious</hi>
Preacher, the severest Punishment that either the
<hi>Laws</hi> or the <hi>Canons</hi> can inflict upon so high an
Offender: That so an ORTHODOX and LOYAL
Person may fill his <hi>Stall</hi> in the <hi>Quire,</hi> and take
his turns in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> for the time to come: And
the Innocent City may be saved Harmless from the
Penalty now imposed upon them, of <hi>hiring</hi> such a
Preacher. I am in great earnest, My Lord, for
I had a thousand times rather fall into a <hi>Bishop's</hi>
hands, than into the hands of any New <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of Tryers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am sorry for the <hi>trouble</hi> that my Preaching
at <hi>Gloucester</hi> hath occasioned to your Lordship,
but I should have been <hi>more</hi> sorry to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it, by <hi>Dawbing with untempered Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and being Meal-mouth'd, and partial (for
fear of displeasing a very <hi>few,</hi> though never so
<hi>powerfull)</hi> in exposing of that, which we are all
obliged to take all opportunities to expose. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I am sure, will bear me witness, that <hi>imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49332:4"/>
is one of the worst faults, I have ever been
guilty of, in any of the Sermons that have made
Men angry; but, by the grace of God, <hi>this</hi> fault
I will <hi>never mend:</hi> And all that know your
Lordship will easily believe, that you'll never like
me one jot the worse for't. Some of the <hi>other</hi> sort of
People in <hi>London,</hi> I hear took such Offence at the
<hi>same</hi> Sermon, as to declare they would never
hear me more. And this Fate of being Censured
and Reproached by the bad or weak of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
those must make full account of undergoing,
who are resolved to doe the Work of their great
Master with all Faithfulness. And this, by God's
help, is <hi>my</hi> sincere Resolution, whatsoever it costs
me; and in the doing of my duty, to have always
in my Eye <hi>that</hi> advice of the Apostle, <hi>Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you doe, doe it heartily, as to the Lord
and not as to men; knowing that of the Lord
you shall receive the Reward of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
for you serve the Lord Christ.</hi> I hope
you will pardon this Freedom to,</p>

            <p>Now an <hi>Offence</hi> or <hi>Scandal</hi> is commonly distinguished
into <hi>Datum</hi> &amp; <hi>Acceptum, Given</hi> and <hi>Taken.</hi> An Offence
<hi>given</hi> is, when such things are said or done as have a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
tendency to the drawing of men into sin. An Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49332:5"/>
               <hi>taken,</hi> or <hi>taken</hi> and not <hi>given,</hi> is, when words or
actions that are <hi>well intended,</hi> and in themselves either
<hi>good</hi> or <hi>lawfull,</hi> are so construed as to be made an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sinning. And in <hi>this</hi> acceptation of the word <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi>
the best <hi>actions</hi> that ever were done may <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi>
become <hi>Offences,</hi> or <hi>Scandals;</hi> and the best <hi>men</hi> that
have ever lived may happen to be <hi>Offenders,</hi> or <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizers.</hi>
Our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself (as appears from the now
cited Text) was one <hi>from whom Offence came,</hi> and that
<hi>mighty</hi> Offence too; He <hi>there</hi> being said, <hi>to be made a
stone of stumbling, and rock of Offence, even to them which
stumble at the word.</hi> And this was predicted concerning
him by Old <hi>Simeon,</hi> Luk. 2. 34. <hi>This Child is set for the
fall, and rising again of many in</hi> Israel: As for the <hi>rising</hi>
of many, so for the <hi>fall</hi> of many; but not <hi>so</hi> set for
their <hi>fall,</hi> as for their <hi>rising;</hi> for he was <hi>designedly</hi> set
for the <hi>rising</hi> of many, but he <hi>accidentally</hi> became an
occasion of the <hi>fall</hi> of many, through the offence they
causelesly took at him, upon several accounts.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>both</hi> these sorts of <hi>Offences, viz.</hi> those <hi>given</hi>
and those onely <hi>taken,</hi> are to be understood in <hi>this</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Text, <hi>Woe to the world because of Offences;</hi>
and in <hi>this</hi> too, <hi>for it must needs be that Offences come.</hi>
But that <hi>Offence</hi> onely which is <hi>given, Scandalum datum,</hi>
is to be understood in the <hi>last</hi> words, <hi>but woe to that
man by whom the Offence cometh.</hi> For no woe can justly
be pronounced against <hi>him</hi> from whom an Offence co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
upon the accout thereof, if he be but a mere
<hi>accidental</hi> cause of the Offence; and it be wholly the
fault of the <hi>Offended</hi> that Offence is taken at him:
which, as we said, was the case of our Blessed Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And indeed no one that ever appeared in the
world was ever so great an <hi>accidental</hi> cause of Peoples
being offended, as <hi>He</hi> was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49332:6"/>II. I proceed to shew, <hi>from whence the Vnavoidable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Offences doth arise.</hi> Our Text saith, that <hi>it must
needs be that Offences come, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
there is a necessity of the coming of Offences.</hi> And St. <hi>Luke</hi>
Chap. 17. 1. doth <hi>thus</hi> express this Passage, <hi>It is impossible
but that Offences will come.</hi> So that there is no prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, as unhappy things as in both these places we
understand they are, by the <hi>Woes</hi> pronounced on the
account of them.</p>
            <p>But we are now to enquire, from <hi>whence</hi> the unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dableness
of them, <hi>the necessity of their coming, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of their not coming</hi> doth proceed.</p>
            <p>And to <hi>this</hi> I answer, that it proceeds from these <hi>two</hi>
causes conjunctly.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From the World's being so full of Folly and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
as it is; and every part thereof.</item>
               <item>2. From God's determination for great ends not to
prevent by his Omnipotency the natural effects of <hi>these.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. From the world's being so full of Folly and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
as it is; and <hi>all</hi> parts of it. I need not go about
to convince you, that the Generality of men in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are far from being Wise; are Rash, Heady and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerative;
acted by Prejudice and blind Passions:
And that the number of those who are calmly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dately
considerative, in their <hi>own</hi> actings, and in passing
judgment upon the actions of <hi>others,</hi> is exceeding small.
And consequently, most men must needs be extremely
prone to <hi>give</hi> Offence, and no less liable to the <hi>taking</hi> of
Offence, when Offence is <hi>given,</hi> and when also it is
<hi>not</hi> given.</p>
            <p>Nor need I go about to convince you, that all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
abound with Wickedness as well as Folly. <hi>The
whole world,</hi> saith St. <hi>Iohn, lieth in wickedness.</hi> 1 Ep. 5.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49332:6"/>
v. 19. So it was in <hi>his</hi> time, and so it hath done, ever
since the first Apostasie, to <hi>our</hi> times. <hi>Moses</hi> gives a
lamentable account of the Depravedness of the <hi>Old</hi>
World; which provoked God Almighty to overflow it
with a Deluge of Waters; <hi>Gen. 6. 5. There</hi> he saith that
<hi>God saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the
Earth, and that every imagination, and the thoughts of his
heart, were onely evil continually.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives a
like sad account of the <hi>New</hi> World, both <hi>Gentile</hi> and
<hi>Iewish, Rom.</hi> 3. from the 9<hi>th</hi> verse. He <hi>there</hi> setteth
forth the <hi>General</hi> fearfull depravation, both of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
and <hi>Iews,</hi> as if it were <hi>Vniversal.</hi> And I need not
tell you that, though the business of Christ's coming
into the world, was <hi>to destroy the works of the Devil;</hi>
and <hi>to Redeem us from all iniquity,</hi> yet his <hi>Grace is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in vain,</hi> and <hi>turned also into wantouness,</hi> by the
<hi>generality</hi> of those that profess faith in him. So that
the <hi>Iews</hi> could not more vie with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
than the <hi>Christians</hi> may vie with both <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles.</hi> And, to our great grief and shame be it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
this may too truly be affirmed, of those that pass
under the name of <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Reformed,</hi> as well as
of <hi>Popish</hi> Professors of Christianity. And although all
Ages have not been <hi>alike</hi> wicked, nor all Countries in
<hi>any</hi> Age, yet the far greater part of all Societies of men
in all Ages have hitherto greatly <hi>corrupted their ways.</hi>
And, which is never sufficiently to be laid to heart, this
<hi>Present</hi> Age is in divers respects more debauched than
<hi>many,</hi> if not than <hi>all,</hi> the foregoing: And <hi>this Nation</hi> is
more so, than it hath been known to be in <hi>formey</hi>
times; notwithstanding the blessed means of Grace we
have enjoyed, above most other People in the World;
and notwithstanding too the very heavy judgments,
which have come for <hi>fourty</hi> years past so thick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49332:7"/>Now then, considering the great wickedness of the
world, and how full all places are of wicked men, <hi>it
must needs be that Offences come:</hi> And 'tis impossible but
that very many in all Ages and Places will be Scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and fall into Sin, by the means of them. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
but all places must be full of Stumbling-blocks,
and 'tis impossible too but that many will fall over
them, and break their Necks; as will be shewn anon.
We add hereunto that,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>It must needs be that Offences come,</hi> because God
Almighty hath, for great Ends, determined, not to
prevent these natural effects of Folly and Wickedness;
not to interpose by his Omnipotency in hindring the
folly and wickedness, which are in mens <hi>hearts,</hi> from
being the causes of Offences. Upon which account we
reade in the Prophesie of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 3. 20. of <hi>God</hi>'s
laying a Stumbling-block <hi>before him that turns from his
righteousness and committeth iniquity.</hi> And it is an idiom
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, which we find often in the
Holy Scriptures, to express that as <hi>done</hi> by another,
which is onely <hi>permitted</hi> to be done. To give but <hi>one</hi>
instance of this, <hi>God</hi> is said in <hi>one</hi> place, to <hi>move</hi> David
<hi>to number the People,</hi> whereas 'tis said in <hi>another,</hi> that
<hi>Satan</hi> moved <hi>David</hi> hereunto; so that the meaning of
<hi>God</hi>'s doing it, must be that he <hi>permitted Satan,</hi> for
great and wise reasons, to doe it. Now,</p>
            <p>1. One Reason wherefore God hath determined not
to hinder the folly and wickedness of men from being
the causes of <hi>Offences,</hi> is the same that is given, why
there must be <hi>Heresies,</hi> or why he will <hi>permit</hi> Heresies
to be. The Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19. There <hi>must be also
Heresies among you, that they which are approved, may
be made manifest among you.</hi> Even so, there must be <hi>Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and Scandals, that there may be a manifest diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and discrimination made, between the <hi>sincere</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49332:7"/>
the <hi>insincere</hi> Professors of Religion: For <hi>this</hi> reason hath
God determined not to restrain foolish or wicked men,
from the laying of Stumbling-blocks. The cause of this
Necessity is far from being his immutable Decree, that
men shall doe foolish or wicked things, and so cause Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals;
God forbid we should entertain so impious a thought:
But the cause thereof is the folly and wickedness of men,
occasioned by the abuse of their Liberty, and God's deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
not to prevent their causing Scandals; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating
<hi>this</hi> for <hi>great reasons:</hi> One of which, I say,
is, that by <hi>them</hi> a Tryal may be made, who are Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right-hearted,
and who Hypocritical, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Religion. Who have the Power of Godliness
and who the External Form onely. That a difference
may be made, between those <hi>Wise</hi> Builders, who have
founded their houses upon a <hi>Rock,</hi> and those <hi>Foolish</hi>
ones, who have built them upon the <hi>Sand:</hi> Between
those who have embraced Religion for its <hi>own</hi> sake, and
those who have embraced it for the sake of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<hi>interest;</hi> and are engaged in the ways thereof,
from corrupt Motives and carnal Principles.</p>
            <p>Thus did God Almighty permit False Prophets to
work wonders by the Power of the Devil, to draw the
People to Idolatry, in order to the making of <hi>this</hi> discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
as may be seen <hi>Deut. 13. 1, 2, 3. If there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
among you a Prophet, or a Dreamer of dreams, and
giveth thee a Sign or a Wonder, and the Sign or the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let
us go after other Gods, which thou hast not known, and let
us serve them: Thou shalt not hearken unto the voice of
that Prophet, or that Dreamer of dreams: For the Lord
your God proveth you, to know whether you love the Lord
your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.</hi> That
is, the Lord your God permitteth this stone of stumbling
to be laid in your way, that it may be as it were, a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49332:8"/>
Touch-stone, for the Tryal of your love to him; that a
discrimination may be hereby made, between those who
<hi>sincerely</hi> love him, and those who only <hi>pretend</hi> to love him.</p>
            <p>For the same reason likewise, did not God restrain <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,
Ahab,</hi> or the other wicked Kings, <hi>Who made
Israel to sin,</hi> from laying before their People the great
Offences and Scandals of the Golden Calves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
temptations to Idolatry by their Precepts and Examples:
And by this means, an apparent difference was <hi>actually</hi>
made, between those who were onely <hi>Iews outwardly,</hi>
and those who were <hi>Iews inwardly.</hi> By this means were
those seven thousand, who hated Idolatry, distinguished
from the rest of the People. <hi>I have,</hi> saith God by the
Prophet, <hi>reserved unto me seven thousand, who have not
bowed the knee to</hi> Baal.</p>
            <p>2. Another Reason, why God hath determined the
not restraining of men from giving <hi>Offence,</hi> or being the
Causes of Scandals, is, that by <hi>them</hi> the Obdurate may,
in his just judgment, be more hardned. For instance,
He permitted <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and his Followers, to be
the Authors of such mighty Scandals, for <hi>this</hi> reason;
as we reade 1 <hi>Thess. 2. 11, For this cause God shall send
them strong delusions</hi> (or shall <hi>permit</hi> them to be sent)
<hi>that they may believe a lie</hi> (or that the hypocritical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of Christianity may believe a lie) <hi>that they all
might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we may be assured, that for <hi>both</hi> the Reasons
now given, God hath permitted the <hi>Roman Hierarchy</hi>
to bring so horrible a Scandal upon the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for so many Ages past; by debauching it with
such corrupt and damnable Principles and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To make a difference between the Sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and Hypocrites; which, I need not tell you, hath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49332:8"/>
by this means been made, in innumerable instances:
Many thousands having chosen the loss of <hi>all,</hi> and even
the most Cruel <hi>deaths,</hi> rather than to embrace those
Principles, and comply with those Practices; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than not to <hi>Protest</hi> against both. And,</p>
            <p>2. In his just judgment to harden <hi>such</hi> more in their
wickedness, as <hi>turn the grace of God into lasciviousness.</hi>
For 'tis well known, nothing is better known than, that
the whole Systeme of Popery is so contrived, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
<hi>light with darkness,</hi> the <hi>thickest</hi> darkness with the
most <hi>glorious</hi> light; gross <hi>Idolatry</hi> of several kinds (such
Idolatry as that grosser is not to be found among the
Pagans) unsatiable <hi>Covetousness</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
<hi>Cruelty,</hi> with true <hi>Christianity;</hi> and a careless and
dissolute life in <hi>this</hi> world, with the hopes of Happiness
in the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for both these reasons hath God, we may be
sure, permitted also fearfull <hi>Offences</hi> and Scandals to
come by <hi>Protestants;</hi> by those who make a <hi>Profession</hi>
of this our holy Religion (of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>genuine</hi> Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
purged from all Popish mixtures) which unto all
sincere and pious Protestants, are matter of most bitter
Lamentation: Particularly the <hi>Drunkenness, Vncleanness</hi>
and <hi>Profaneness</hi> of Multitudes that profess the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion, and the Scandal of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Conspiracies,</hi> that some of them have incurred
the guilt of; and <hi>that</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Kingdome, now very
<hi>lately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though all good Protestants do bless God heartily,
for the Discovery of such Conspiracies, and for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating
of open Resistences of the Higher Powers, and
secret Plots against them; yet 'tis a heart-breaking Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
to <hi>such,</hi> that there should be such Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
doings found among us; by which a woefull
Blot is cast upon our Religion, and particularly by this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49332:9"/>
               <hi>last</hi> wicked Conspiracy of some Mad Desperate People,
who call themselves Protestants.</p>
            <p>Now, I say, for <hi>both</hi> the forementioned reasons, we
may be assured God Almighty hath permitted such fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Offences</hi> and Scandals, to come by professed <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
Viz.</p>
            <p>1. To make a discrimination between those who are
well Grounded in our Religion, and those that are not
so. Those who are well Grounded in our Religion, and
embrace it like Wise and Understanding men, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the excellency of its Principles, will not be
tempted to think one jot the worse of it, in regard of
these <hi>Offences.</hi> Such will consider that if <hi>these</hi> can make
a <hi>reasonable</hi> objection against the truth of the <hi>Protestant</hi>
Religion, the <hi>same</hi> objection lies every whit as <hi>strong,</hi>
against the truth of <hi>Christianity:</hi> For even in the <hi>First</hi>
and <hi>Purest</hi> Ages of Christianity, there were as wicked
people found among the Professors of it, and men that
did as wicked things, as ever were before or since to be
found in the World. Such will consider too, that the
<hi>Protestant</hi> Religion is no more to be charged with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
or any other Licentious Principles, than is
<hi>Christianity:</hi> For <hi>this</hi> Religion is nothing else but Pure
and Uncorrupted Christianity. Nay they will consider,
that Rebellion and Treason, and whatsoever hath any
<hi>tendency</hi> that way, and all kinds of immorality whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
are expresly <hi>forbidden</hi> by our Religion, under pain
of Damnation. They being so forbidden, as by the
Precepts of the Gospel, and the Doctrine of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, so <hi>especially</hi> by the Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as by Law established, derived
from the Gospel. And therefore <hi>these Offences</hi> are no
objection to Understanding and well Grounded Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
against the truth of their Religion; whilst
those that have embraced it onely because it is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49332:9"/>
of their <hi>Countrey,</hi> or on such like weak and sleight
Grounds, do often find <hi>this</hi> Objection too strong for
them; and it frequently occasions <hi>their</hi> Apostasie. And
then especially are such in danger of Apostatizing, by
means of this Scandal of <hi>Treasons</hi> and <hi>Rebellions</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
(as often as these sins are found among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants)
when the Adversaries of our Religion do assault
them with the Sophistical Argument drawn from this
Scandal, with all the Advantage of <hi>their</hi> Sophistry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you may say, If the <hi>Popish</hi> Treasons and
Conspiracies are used by <hi>us,</hi> as an Argument against
<hi>that</hi> Religion; why should not the <hi>Papists</hi> make use of
the Treasons and Conspiracies of <hi>Protestants,</hi> as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
against <hi>our</hi> Religion? This seems to be Fair
Play.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer, that <hi>Popish</hi> Treasons and Conspiracies
may <hi>not</hi> be used by <hi>us,</hi> as an Argument against the
<hi>Popish Religion</hi> (nor are they so used by any wise man,
that I know of) because, for the reason already given,
this is a <hi>fallacious</hi> Argument. But <hi>our</hi> Argument against
<hi>them</hi> is, that their Treasons and Conspiracies are suitable
and agreeable to the allowed <hi>Principles</hi> of Popery;
provided at least, that they be levelled against Heretical
Princes. And if <hi>those</hi> committed among <hi>us</hi> can be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be suited to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Principles, and by
<hi>them</hi> encouraged, then will not I, for <hi>my</hi> part, ever
more open my mouth for the Protestant Religion. But
<hi>this</hi> can <hi>never</hi> be shewed, but the perfectly <hi>contrary</hi> who
cannot shew? And as for the Principles that some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
have imbibed, they are not <hi>Protestants</hi> in imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
them, nay they are <hi>Papists</hi> in so doing: For 'tis
very well known, they at least <hi>Originally</hi> received
them from <hi>their</hi> Books: Particularly from the Books
(as I can shew) of these Jesuits, <hi>Suarez, Lessius, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> with divers others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49332:10"/>Again Secondly, God also permits these grievous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
to come by Protestants (as for the making the
forementioned discrimination between Protestants and
Protestants, so) for the farther hardening, in his just
judgment, of wicked people: For the farther harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of irreligious people against <hi>all</hi> Religion, and of
obstinate Papists against <hi>our</hi> Religion. In <hi>Rom. 2. 21,
22, &amp;c.</hi> the Apostle saith, <hi>Thou that teachest another,
teachest thou not thy self? thou that preachest a man
should not steal, dost thou steal? thou that sayest a man
should not commit Adultery, dost thou commit Adultery?
thou that abhorrest Idols, dost thou commit Sacrilege?
thou that makest thy boast of the Law, through breaking the
Law, dishonourest thou God?</hi> then it follows, <hi>For the
name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles, through you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To keep to the instances of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Treason,</hi> the
Papists, when they see such doings among Protestants,
(willingly overlooking the innumerable instances of
this nature which <hi>themselves</hi> are so infamous for through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world: And seeming not to know what <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
they have to encourage them in such Practices)
they immediately cry out, <hi>These are your Protestants,
and this is their Religion; 'tis good for nothing but to make
men Rebels and Traytors. Princes can have no security
from these Protestants.</hi> And they urge the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for <hi>the utter destruction of the Protestant Religion,</hi>
that was used by <hi>Bishlam,</hi> and his Company, to King
<hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> against <hi>the Rebuilding of Ierusalem,</hi> viz.
<hi>This City is a Rebellious City, and hurtfull unto Kings and
Provinces.</hi> And, no doubt of it, our Adversaries will not
be wanting in improving <hi>this</hi> Argument to the utmost,
at <hi>this</hi> time: Though there are no sort of men in the
world, but might with a <hi>better</hi> face doe it. And so,
by this means, they more harden <hi>themselves</hi> (if they
can be <hi>more</hi> hardened) in their Enmity to <hi>our</hi> Religion,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49332:10"/>
and more harden <hi>others.</hi> And, as I said, for <hi>this</hi> reason,
no doubt, God permitteth in his just judgment, <hi>this</hi>
sort of Offences, as well as <hi>others,</hi> to come by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.
I mean still, by <hi>Professors</hi> of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
for the Authors of such Offences cannot be
more than in <hi>Profession</hi> Protestants: Nay, considered as
guilty of such Offences, they are truly <hi>Papists; so far
forth</hi> they deserve that name.</p>
            <p>I may apply to this discourse, those words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>Iohn 9. 39. For judgment am I come into this world,
that they which see not, might see, and that they which
see might be made blind.</hi> That those which sit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
may have the light; and that those who have the
light, but wilfully shut their eyes against it (as one
would think those Papists do who live among <hi>us)</hi> and
will not be convinced by the strongest and most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Arguments, <hi>may be made blind.</hi> And <hi>Offences,</hi> or
Scandals, are great instruments in the hand of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice, for <hi>this</hi> purpose.</p>
            <p>III. I come to shew that <hi>Offences are of woefull conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi>
We learn from our Text, that they are so to
the <hi>world,</hi> or to men in <hi>general; Woe unto the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of Offences:</hi> And likewise, to those <hi>particular</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<hi>by whom they come; but woe to that man by whom the
Offence cometh.</hi> Now,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As to their being of woefull consequence to the
<hi>world,</hi> or to the <hi>generality</hi> of men. It hath been intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
already, that such is the <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi> of the
Generality, that when these Snares are laid before
them, they occasion their <hi>falling into Sin;</hi> and also Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
in all places are mightily <hi>hardened</hi> in sin, by the
means of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49332:11"/>1. They occasion their <hi>falling into sin,</hi> to the great
endangering of their Souls; and, as we see very ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
to the ruining of themselves and their Families, as
to all the concerns of <hi>this</hi> world. Wicked men are the
most Pernicious instruments, the Devil can make use of,
in the carrying on his great work, of drawing men into
<hi>Sin,</hi> and, by that means, into <hi>Misery</hi> both here and
hereafter, both temporal and eternal. As <hi>they are of
their Father the Devil,</hi> so <hi>his works they doe,</hi> as our Lord
said of the <hi>Pharisees;</hi> they doe <hi>this</hi> work which is most
properly and peculiarly the work of the Devil, with
strange success. And <hi>then</hi> do offences prove the most
fatal stumbling-blocks, when those by whom they come
are men in circumstances to work forceably upon the
<hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> of others: Or when they are such as
have laid great <hi>Obligations</hi> on those whom they tempt to
evil. To be under a great Obligation to a wicked man
is a mighty Snare. The Principle of Ingenuity, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
a Principle as it is, doth too frequently, in <hi>this</hi>
circumstance, prove infinitely mischievous. A great
Benefactor is with the greatest difficulty in the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
any thing he will demand, by a good natured man;
by a man that hath much of Gratitude in his temper,
and a quick sense of kindnesses: And this man offers
great violence to himself, whensoever he refuseth to doe
that which his Benefactor putteth him upon, or which
he knoweth will please him.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>then</hi> are <hi>Offences</hi> very fatal stumbling-blocks,
when those by whom they come, are in great repute
for <hi>Wisdom.</hi> Men are apt to give up themselves to be
led blindfold by those whom they take to be mighty
Wise. But of <hi>more</hi> force are those <hi>Offences</hi> to draw men
into Sin, which come by Sly <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> who have
deceived people into a wonderfull opinion of their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.
Now by such means, and upon such accounts as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49332:11"/>
               <hi>these</hi> (to which may be added divers others) we find
by woefull experience, that but few comparatively,
when the Snares of <hi>Offences</hi> are laid before them, are so
happy as to <hi>escape</hi> the danger of them.</p>
            <p>2. Multitudes also in all places are grievously <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
in sin, by the means of <hi>Offences;</hi> as when they
come by <hi>great Professors of Religion</hi> especially. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
people, and such as have little <hi>kindness</hi> for Religion,
be they never so <hi>knowing,</hi> are too apt to conclude from
thence, that either Religion is a mere <hi>Cheat,</hi> and hath
nothing of <hi>reality</hi> in it; or, if it hath, that it may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of certain <hi>evil practices,</hi> in order to certain <hi>good
ends:</hi> Or that the miscarriages they behold in those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
men, are such as a man may be guilty of, and
yet be <hi>truly</hi> Religious: and that they are but the <hi>Spots
of God's Children:</hi> All which Conclusions, though they
be not errors of a <hi>like hainous nature,</hi> yet are of much a
<hi>like dangerous consequence.</hi> And though it cannot but be
observed, that there are many noted Professors of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that live Extraordinarily good lives; yet men that
have no mind to be good, and that encourage themselves,
as much as they can, to live wickedly, will not inferr
from hence, that these do excell the <hi>Scandalous</hi> Professors
in real Goodness, but rather in <hi>Slyness.</hi> They will
perswade themselves, to conclude nothing more from
hence, than that these have a better faculty at <hi>hiding</hi>
their sins from the Eye of the World. And they hope
that many of <hi>these</hi> in due time, may make their vicious
inclinations as publick as <hi>others</hi> have done. And thus,
I say, are wicked men rendered more <hi>Obdurate,</hi> are more
<hi>hardned</hi> in their sins, by the means of <hi>Offences;</hi> and by
the <hi>Offences</hi> especially of those who have been noted <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of Religion.</hi> The horrible <hi>Offence</hi> that <hi>David</hi> was
guilty of, in those <hi>two</hi> fearfull Sins, caused (as <hi>Nathan</hi>
told him) <hi>the Enemies of the Lord to blaspheme;</hi> and <hi>so</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49332:12"/>
greatly <hi>hardned</hi> them in their Irreligion. For which
reason, though <hi>David</hi> was so forgiven upon his true
Repentance, as not to be punished for them in the World
to <hi>come,</hi> yet he paid most dearly for them in <hi>this</hi>
World.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>I</hi> now <hi>come to the Woefull Consequence that
Offences are of to those</hi> Particular <hi>persons</hi> by whom they
come. But woe to the man by whom the Offence cometh.</p>
            <p>That the case of such is most deplorable, will be seen
by what our Saviour saith, immediately before the
words of my Text, <hi>viz. But whoso shall offend one of these
little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that
a Millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were
drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi> And St. <hi>Mark</hi> relateth
the same words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 42. and so doth St. <hi>Luke</hi> too,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 2. that the <hi>greater</hi> regard may be given unto
them. And <hi>this</hi> is the meaning of these words: He that
shall either by words, or deeds, discourage the very <hi>meanest</hi>
of Christ's Disciples, from holding on in his Christian
Practice; shall cause him to fall into Sin; it will be
better for him to have a great heavy weight hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his neck, and to be therewith cast into the Sea;
whereby he will be hurried to the bottom of it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
suffered to rise again. What an Emphatical expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is <hi>this,</hi> of the most woefull state, which that Person
is in by whose means <hi>Offences,</hi> or Scandals, come! And
mark, the Condition of <hi>that</hi> man is declared to be thus
dreadfull, who hath caused to offend any <hi>one,</hi> and that
of the <hi>meanest</hi> and <hi>weakest</hi> of those <hi>that believe in Christ.</hi>
How unexpressibly sad and dismal <hi>then,</hi> shall his Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be, who in this sense hath <hi>Offended many!</hi> I mean
upon supposition, he prevents it not, by timely Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49332:12"/>And what reason have those of us, who are in a <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Station, whether <hi>Magistrates</hi> or <hi>Ministers,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<hi>this</hi> well, and lay it to heart, and to have an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>
care of <hi>our</hi> lives! For <hi>our</hi> Example will have
a <hi>much larger</hi> influence on <hi>others,</hi> than the Example of
<hi>Private</hi> Persons: And if by any Evil Practice or Advice,
we cause <hi>any</hi> to offend, we are like to cause <hi>many</hi> to offend.
And, consequently, how extremely miserable must <hi>our</hi>
Condition then necessarily be in the World to come!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will conclude the Doctrinal part with</hi> those <hi>words,</hi>
Deut. 27. 18. Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
out of the way <hi>(or that</hi> shall put a stumbling-block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the blind, <hi>contrary to the Law of God.</hi> Lev. 19. 14.)
and all the people shall say Amen.</p>
            <p>I now come to make <hi>Application</hi> of what hath been
discoursed, and our Application shall be <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How Infinitely are we all concerned, as we would
not have the <hi>Woe</hi> pronounced against those <hi>by whom Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
come,</hi> for <hi>our</hi> Portion, to look to it that we be not
found of that number! And if at present any of us <hi>are,</hi>
to Repent immediately, to bewail in the bitterness of
our Spirits our having caused Offences, and to doe all
that lies in our power, for the time to come, not onely
<hi>to give no Offence in any thing</hi> (according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3.) but also to <hi>Repair</hi> the injury we have
done to <hi>Religion,</hi> and to the <hi>Souls</hi> of men, by whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Offences we have occasioned. And that we may
so doe, it will be necessary to consider the <hi>Several Ways</hi>
whereby Offence may be taken, that so we may avoid
it in those instances: And if we are Conscious to our
selves of having been guilty in any of them, we may
Repent and Reform for the Future.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="sermon">
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49332:13"/>
            <head>Here begins the second Sermon.</head>
            <p>I. One way of Offending is the Drawing of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
into Erroneous Opinions. I mean <hi>such</hi> as have an ill
influence upon mens Lives and Natures. I don't mean
such as are merely <hi>not true;</hi> for, there being divers
points relating to Religion so disputable, as that no man
can certainly tell, whether he be not mistaken in them:
if I should make <hi>him</hi> guilty of this sin of <hi>Offending,</hi> who
happens to lead his Brother into any false Notion, I
should be forced to assert, that a man may be guilty of
<hi>giving Offence,</hi> and not be able to know he is so. But it
is not to be imagined, that a Sin which hath so great a
Woe attending it as <hi>this</hi> in the Text, can possibly be a
Sin of Unavoidable infirmity, or invincible Ignorance.
So that I say, by Erroneous Opinions I mean, such as
are apt in their own nature to lead men into Sin; to
make men irreligious, or to encourage to any <hi>particular</hi>
Sin, or to the neglect of any necessary Duty. And all
<hi>such</hi> we are certain are erroneous, and contrary to the
true sense and meaning of God's word, <hi>because</hi> they
have such a tendency. I will give a few <hi>instances</hi> of
such false and corrupt Principles, <hi>viz. That God is the
Author of Sin, That he not onely</hi> foreknows <hi>all the sins of
men but hath also</hi> decreed <hi>them:</hi> Which in <hi>other</hi> words
is the same with the former. <hi>That all mens Fates are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
absolutely:</hi> that is, without respect to their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
obedience or disobedience. <hi>That 'tis lawfull to doe
evil that good may come. That Good works are not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Salvation. That the Covenant of Grace is Vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional.
That Religion is a mere passive thing; not our
work at all, but wholly God's in us. That mere Attrition</hi>
(or Sorrow for sin for fear of Hell) <hi>is able to bring a
Sinner to justification, if accompanied with the Sacrament
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49332:13"/>
of Penance.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sess. 4. cap. 4.</note> Which is a Doctrine plainly
delivered in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All <hi>these,</hi> to which I might add abundance more of
like nature, wherewith mens minds have been corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
do manifestly encourage to a careless, loose and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious
Life.</p>
            <p>And to <hi>these</hi> I might add instances of such Principles
as encourage to certain <hi>particular</hi> Sins, of Commission
and Omission. In the number of which are all those
<hi>Popish</hi> ones, that lead to <hi>Idolatry</hi> of divers kinds; that
encourage <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Treasonable practices,</hi> with
which <hi>latter</hi> too many corrupt and spurious Protestants
have declared themselves to be infected, to the great
scandal of our holy Religion; as hath <hi>already</hi> been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
Who,<note place="margin">See <hi>Dr. Hicks</hi> his Spirit of Popery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> while they profess to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr
<hi>Popery,</hi> have been found to be the
genuine Off-spring of the <hi>Iesuite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of <hi>this</hi> Rank are also those Doctrines, both <hi>Popish</hi>
and <hi>Fanatical,</hi> that tend to make men <hi>Fierce</hi> and <hi>Bitter,
Proud</hi> and <hi>Selfish;</hi> that destroy Charity, and spoil mens
tempers.</p>
            <p>Now those that propagate any such Principles, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>directly,</hi> or by <hi>manifest</hi> and <hi>plain consequence,</hi> tend
to make the Embracers of them irreligious, or that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
to any <hi>particular</hi> sins, are great Offenders of their
Brethren: Nor are there any <hi>greater</hi> destroyers of Souls
than Corrupters and Debauchers of mens <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi>
nor any <hi>so</hi> great. The Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> charged
<hi>Timothy</hi> to beware of being found in the number of <hi>these,
2 Ep.</hi> 2. ch. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Study to shew thy self approved
unto God, a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed,
rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun prophane
and vain bablings</hi> (the wretched Doctrines of Seducers)
<hi>for they will encrease unto more ungodliness</hi> (or greatly
encouage wickedness.) <hi>And their words will eat as doth a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49332:14"/>
Canker, of whom is</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Philetus, <hi>who concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the truth have erred, saying, that the Resurrection is
past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</hi> And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they be, that are guilty of this kind of Offences;
that are guilty of causing men to <hi>sin</hi> by corrupting their
<hi>judgments,</hi> may (till they become true Penitents) look
upon themselves as greatly concerned in those words of
our Saviour, <hi>Matt. 5. 19. Whosoever shall break one of
these least Commandments, and shall teach men so</hi> (shall
teach men to evacuate and destroy the force of any <hi>one</hi>
Commandment of the Moral Law) <hi>he shall be called the
least in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Or, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
interprets it, <hi>He shall be thought unworthy of having his
name written, in the Catalogue of Christians</hi> here, <hi>or of
Saints</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude the Argument I am now upon,
I think my self obliged to add, that I would not for a
World, have had a hand in possessing mens minds with
those Principles, which have administred to our Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and most Unchristian <hi>Divisions;</hi> and, while they
are entertained, will make all endeavours for the Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them ineffectual: <hi>viz.</hi> such as <hi>these,</hi> That <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Churches are no Churches of Christ.</hi> That <hi>the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church by</hi> Bishops <hi>is Antichristian.</hi> That <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,
or Set Forms of Prayer, are a Stinting of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and therefore 'tis unlawfull to join in them.</hi> That
<hi>nothing is to be done in the Worship of God, but
what is expresly commanded.</hi> That <hi>indifferent things,
when they come once to be Commanded, become sinfull; and
the Commanding of them is a violation of our Christian
Liberty.</hi> That <hi>Infant Baptism is no Baptism; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
those that have no other, are no Church Members;
and therefore not to be Communicated withall.</hi> That <hi>it is
Lawfull and a Duty to Separate from a Church, upon the
account of Promiscuous Congregations, and Mixt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49332:14"/>
That <hi>there is no such tie between Ministers and
their People, but that the People may cast them off, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they think they can Edifie more by any other: And
are obliged to betake themselves to those by whom they
think they can most Edifie.</hi> That <hi>an inward Call</hi> (that is,
a strong impulse of Phancy) <hi>is a sufficient warrant to any
man, to be a Publique Preacher.</hi> I say I, would not for a
<hi>World,</hi> have had a hand in the Propagating of <hi>these,</hi> and
many the like Notions, which of <hi>late</hi> years have strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevailed among us: For, as they have no warrant
or <hi>Countenance</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi> so have they been woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
mischievous to the Church of God, and to this
<hi>our</hi> Church. They are good for nothing, but to cause
Schisms and Factions; but to destroy all good Order,
and bring in Confusion; as we too well know by sad
Experience. And by this means, they have done our
Common Adversary mighty Service, and the Souls of
men infinite prejudice. And I earnestly desire, that
those who are, or have been, promoters of such Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
may be before it be too late convinced, how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are involved in the guilt of <hi>Offending;</hi> or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
people to Offend: Of making them strangely <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious</hi>
and <hi>Vncharitable,</hi> mighty <hi>Vnmanageable</hi> and <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable,</hi>
extremely <hi>Conceited, Vain</hi> and <hi>Wanton,</hi> and
most <hi>Vnfixed</hi> and <hi>Vnsettled:</hi> Innumerable of those who
have entertained <hi>such</hi> Principles, having been known to
run from one Sect to another, till they have at last set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
in Quakerism, or turned mere Scepticks, or cast
off <hi>all</hi> Religion: Have been <hi>tossed to and fro, and carried
about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men,
and the cunning craftiness of those, that lie in wait to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray take notice that what I have now said, hath
not proceeded from the least pique at <hi>Persons,</hi> but from
pure <hi>good-will</hi> to those who are herein concerned: From
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49332:15"/>
hearty love and charity to their Souls, and a solicitous
concern for the interest of our Religion, and the welfare
of the <hi>Publique.</hi> And having solemnly declared <hi>this,</hi>
I hope I shall not need to use St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Expostulation, <hi>Am
I therefore become your Enemy, because I tell you the
truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Another way of <hi>Offending,</hi> or making people to
Offend, is inticing them to Sin by wicked <hi>Advice</hi> and
<hi>Solicitations;</hi> which is an horribly bad way <hi>indeed:</hi>
But, as bad as it is, it is very <hi>common.</hi> Particularly, as
to <hi>intemperate Drinking,</hi> how common is it grown in
this most dissolute Age, not onely to <hi>intice,</hi> but even to
<hi>force</hi> men to <hi>this</hi> Sin! notwithstanding the <hi>woe</hi> that is
pronounced against him <hi>who giveth his Neighbour drink,
and putteth his Bottle to him, and maketh him drunk,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 15. And there is a fine device of Good-Fellows,
to force down Drink <hi>Civilly</hi> and <hi>Gentily,</hi> namely, <hi>that</hi>
of multiplying Healths; which not to pledge, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to pledge them in <hi>full</hi> Glasses, and those <hi>large</hi> ones
too, is to be mighty Rude, and at <hi>least</hi> deserves a <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.</hi>
But I will trouble my self no longer with these
wicked men, than while I conjure you to fly their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and all their Haunts, as you would do the Dens
of the most Salvage Beasts.</p>
            <p>I might add, to this sin of inticing to <hi>Drunkenness,
that</hi> of inticing to <hi>Vncleanness,</hi> and several other sorts of
Wickedness, not <hi>much less</hi> Common: Particularly (to
name no more) to <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Conspiracies</hi> against the
King and his Government; which, of late years, to our
Amazement have been practised, by <hi>more</hi> among us,
than have been known to adventure upon so fearfull a
sin, in some whole Ages heretofore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now these Tempters of others to Wickedness, are
Daring Sinners</hi> indeed, Who, <hi>as the Apostle saith,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49332:15"/>
Rom. 1. 32. knowing the judgment of God, that they which
commit such things are worthy of death, not onely <hi>doe</hi> the
same, but have <hi>pleasure</hi> in them that doe them: Which
<hi>Pleasure excites them to doe their utmost, to make</hi>
others <hi>as wicked as</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p>What <hi>name</hi> shall I give to <hi>these</hi> Sinners? They deserve
no <hi>better,</hi> than that of <hi>Devils</hi> in <hi>Humane</hi> Bodies. These
one would think, are affraid of being damned with <hi>too
little</hi> Company; and they are not content to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for their <hi>own</hi> sins onely, but must have their Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
inhaunced by the Sins of <hi>others,</hi> which they
make their <hi>own.</hi> And therefore they seem not to be
satisfied with the <hi>same</hi> damnation for <hi>kind,</hi> with that of
the <hi>Devils,</hi> without the <hi>same</hi> damnation for <hi>degree</hi> too.</p>
            <p>III. Another way of <hi>Offending,</hi> and laying Stumbling-blocks
before others, is that of <hi>Affrighting</hi> or <hi>Discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi>
others, from being Religious, or from the doing
of their duty in <hi>particular</hi> instances.</p>
            <p>1. The highest Offence of <hi>this</hi> kind is that of <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
for <hi>Righteousness</hi> sake: Which is a great <hi>Offence</hi> and
Scandal, to those that are <hi>actually</hi> persecuted, or in <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
of Persecution. And Persecution for <hi>Well-doing</hi> is
such a Stumbling-block as hath occasioned the <hi>Falling
away</hi> of Multitudes of Professors of Religion. And 'tis a
thousand to one that <hi>he</hi> who is not well confirmed in his
Religion, or, if he <hi>be,</hi> is not a Conscientious Practicer
of the duties thereof, will not stand his ground; <hi>especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
when he meets with, or finds himself in <hi>danger</hi> of,
the <hi>Sharpest</hi> sort of Persecutions: When he meets with
a <hi>Fiery Tryal</hi> or is in <hi>danger</hi> of it. See what our <hi>Lord</hi>
saith of the <hi>Stony ground</hi> Hearers, <hi>Matt. 4. 17. These are
they which are sown on stony ground, who when they have
heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; and
have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49332:16"/>
Afterwards, when Affliction or Persecution ariseth for the
word's sake, immediately they are offended:</hi> or fall away.
And the danger Christ's Disciples are in, of falling off
from him, when they cannot adhere to him, but they
must suffer <hi>Persecution,</hi> is intimated in <hi>those</hi> words
<hi>Matt. 11. 6. And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not tell you that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
guilty of this kind of <hi>Offence;</hi> but so is not our <hi>own</hi>
Church, God be thanked. Her <hi>terms of Communion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none of them such, as contradict <hi>any</hi> Law of <hi>God;</hi>
as abundance of the <hi>Best</hi> of people are verily persuaded:
And not a <hi>few</hi> of our <hi>Divines,</hi> and other <hi>Learned men,</hi>
have with <hi>great,</hi> and, I think, <hi>irresistible</hi> strength de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</p>
            <p>2. Another <hi>Offence</hi> of <hi>this</hi> nature is Representing the
ways of Religion as very Rugged and Difficult, and the
duties thereof as over Harsh and Severe; and at least
<hi>next</hi> to impossible. Representing the Yoke of Christ as
an <hi>Vneasie</hi> Yoke; and his Burthen as an <hi>intolerably</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Burthen. <hi>This</hi> hath ordinarily been the Practice of
Sensual People, of people who are wedded to their
Lusts and Vile Affections. And by this means, I fear,
not a few poor Souls have been utterly ruined, who
have given more credit to these <hi>Wretched People,</hi> than
to their <hi>Saviour,</hi> or to those Good men who assure
them, that <hi>such</hi> Representations are most <hi>false</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,</hi>
from their own <hi>Experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Another Offence under <hi>this</hi> Head is, <hi>that</hi> which
was charged by our Blessed Saviour upon the <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
viz. <hi>Binding of Heavy Burthens;</hi> and <hi>Teaching for Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
the Commandments of Men:</hi> Or, making a great
number of <hi>Additions</hi> of their own to the Laws of <hi>God;</hi>
and imposing them as <hi>necessary to Salvation.</hi> And <hi>so</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Religion to be <hi>indeed</hi> a mighty burthensome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49332:16"/>And of <hi>this</hi> Offence the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
guilty, than were those <hi>Pharisees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I must again doe that right to our <hi>own</hi> Church, as
to pronounce Her <hi>Guiltless,</hi> as to <hi>this</hi> Offence also: She
having not made any thing a <hi>Part</hi> of Religion, but what
is plainly contained in the Holy Scriptures; nor enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing of her <hi>own</hi> as <hi>necessary to Salvation;</hi> but
onely in order to the more Solemn Administration of
Divine Worship, according to <hi>general</hi> Rules laid down
in Scripture: Which hath not determined, as all sober
men will grant, the <hi>particular</hi> circumstances of Worship,
but prescribed Rules in <hi>general,</hi> whereby the Governours
of Churches may determine them.</p>
            <p>4. Another Offence, under this <hi>third</hi> Head, is Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those who have fallen into Errours of Judgment
or Practice, with too great <hi>Harshness</hi> and <hi>Severity.</hi> I
mean, continually inveighing against them, with migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Heat and Fierceness; and taking all Opportunities to
expose them, and to make them the Objects of Hatred,
or of Contempt and Scorn.</p>
            <p>It is found by Experience, that <hi>this</hi> is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the way, to convince men of their Mistakes, and to
bring them to Repentance for their Miscarriages, that it
stops their Ears against our Arguments, and fills them
with Prejudice against our Admonitions; and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
endeavours we use, for the Reclaiming of them.
We must first satisfie Offenders that we are their Friends,
before we can hope to work any good upon them. But
<hi>this</hi> kind of Behaviour is never like to convince them,
that we love them. I am sure <hi>this</hi> is not to follow
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Admonition, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 24, 25. The Servant of
the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men; apt
to teach, patient: In meekness instructing those that oppose
themselves; if God peradventure will give them Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
to the acknowledging of the truth.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49332:17"/>
Paraphrase upon <hi>these</hi> words, <hi>in meekness instructing those
that oppose themselves,</hi> is <hi>this; Dealing with those who are
of different Opinions from us, with great temper and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
though in opposing us they oppose the truth.</hi> Nor again,
is this angry passionate way of dealing with <hi>such</hi> Persons,
to follow the counsel of the <hi>same</hi> Apostle, <hi>Gal. 6. 1. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
if any man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
restore such a one in the Spirit of Meekness; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
thy self lest thou also be tempted:</hi> Considering that
<hi>thou</hi> art no less liable both to Errours of Judgment and
Practice, than is thy <hi>Brother;</hi> and art not kept by thine
<hi>own</hi> strength, from falling into <hi>his</hi> Errours.</p>
            <p>And let me take this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to mind you likewise,<note place="margin">A Complaint brought to me in my own Parish, where I first Preached this Sermon, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that which follows.</note>
that it is yet <hi>more</hi> Unchristian, to
be severe upon those whom we
perceive to be sensible of their having been in an Errour,
and are <hi>returned</hi> or <hi>returning</hi> to their duty; to be still
upbraiding <hi>these</hi> with what is past; and to load them
with heavy Censures, as if the change that is observed in
them hath proceeded, <hi>not</hi> from any <hi>good</hi> Principle, <hi>not</hi>
from Conviction of judgment, but from the <hi>mere Fear</hi>
of the lash of the Law. But how contrary are these
Doings to that Charity, which the Apostle tells us, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
all things, and Believeth all things;</hi> and makes the
best Interpretations and Constructions! And this Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
towards such is mightily discouraging, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a great <hi>Offence,</hi> Scandal and Stumbling-block, both
to <hi>them,</hi> and to those who still persist in their Errours.
The <hi>Former,</hi> by this means, are shrewdly tempted to
repent of their change, and to go back again: And the
<hi>Latter</hi> to take warning by their Usage, and are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being made more Obstinate, and confirmed in
their resolution to stand their ground, and to keep
where they are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49332:17"/>Now I intreat such as are guilty of <hi>this Offence</hi> to
consider,</p>
            <p>1. That it is a great Rashness, and a great Wickedness
too, <hi>thus</hi> to judge of Peoples <hi>hearts.</hi> What is <hi>this</hi> but
to assume to <hi>our selves</hi> the peculiar Prerogative of God
Almighty?</p>
            <p>2. Consider that the <hi>Execution of the Laws</hi> may be
the <hi>occasion</hi> of fallen persons rising again, and returning
to their duty, and yet notwithstanding they may <hi>so doe</hi>
from the Conviction of their Judgments. That is, the
<hi>Execution of the Laws</hi> may awaken those to more serious
and impartial consideration, which by <hi>other</hi> means could
not be brought to it; and who can say of such as are
now reduced, either <hi>wholly</hi> or in <hi>part,</hi> that this is not
<hi>their</hi> case?</p>
            <p>3. If we could certainly know that <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> are
reduced by mere <hi>bye</hi> respects; that no <hi>inward</hi> change is
wrought in them, but that they are onely become <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally</hi>
conformable; yet <hi>such</hi> a treating of them as I
am now blaming, would be a <hi>mighty</hi> fault for all that.
For in due time these <hi>insincere</hi> Converts may become as
<hi>sincerely</hi> affected towards our National Establishment,
as the <hi>best</hi> of <hi>our selves,</hi> if they be but <hi>well</hi> dealt with:
But if they find us an <hi>ill natured</hi> sort of People, given to
Upbraiding and Censuring, Gibing and Flouting, we shall
tempt them, while they continue <hi>with</hi> us, to resolve
never to be <hi>of</hi> us; and still to hold up an Aversation to
our <hi>Church,</hi> for <hi>our</hi> sakes. But this is no very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Consideration; for 'tis not impossible that <hi>False
Friends</hi> may <hi>again</hi> become more mischievous to our
Church, than <hi>Professed Enemies.</hi> And <hi>this</hi> leads me to
entreat you to Consider,</p>
            <p>4. That an unkind treating of <hi>those</hi> who <hi>now</hi> come
over to our Communion, is a plain demonstration, that
we have as little <hi>true</hi> love for our <hi>Church,</hi> as we have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49332:18"/>
for the <hi>Souls</hi> of those we thus discourage. You shall
not find an <hi>Hearty Papist,</hi> I'll warrant you, bestowing
an <hi>unpleasing word,</hi> or a <hi>sour look,</hi> upon any that go over
from <hi>us</hi> to <hi>their</hi> Church; but he immediately embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
them with <hi>both</hi> his Arms, and bids them Wellcome:
Nor, surely, can any <hi>sincere</hi> Lovers of <hi>our</hi> Church and
Religion, be so much mistaken in their true interest, as
to discourage any from <hi>Returning,</hi> that have <hi>Departed</hi>
from our Communion, or from <hi>Continuing</hi> therein, that
are <hi>Returned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, To give these discouragements, is to put an
Effectual Affront upon our <hi>Governours.</hi> For those that
doe so, do as good as plainly tell the World, that they
look upon their Design in the Execution of the Laws,
to be mere <hi>Revenge,</hi> and not the <hi>Reformation of Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
Or if they would be thought not to have such a
base opinion of their Governours, they must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that they doe what they can, to render their <hi>true</hi>
Design therein Unsuccessfull. But I know not <hi>which</hi>
of these is the <hi>greater</hi> Affront to them. And therefore
I hope, that all who hear me this day, will carefully
avoid this very scandalous practice of <hi>some</hi> People; as
they would approve themselves <hi>Good Churchmen,</hi> and
<hi>truly Loyal Subjects;</hi> and, much more, as they would
approve themselves <hi>Good Christians,</hi> who dread to fall
under the Sad <hi>Woe</hi> pronounced in my Text, against
those by <hi>whom Offences come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. Another way of <hi>Offending</hi> is by an evil <hi>Example.</hi>
This is the <hi>last</hi> I shall name, as wanting time to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of divers others, with which I might present
you. Evil <hi>Examples</hi> are extremely Scandalous and <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive,</hi>
by the means of the great inclination of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to <hi>Imitation.</hi> 'Tis a known saying, <hi>Plus docent
Exempla quam Praecepta, The most powerfull way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49332:18"/>
is by Examples, and these signifie more than Precepts.</hi>
There is no <hi>small</hi> force in <hi>good</hi> Examples, but <hi>much
greater</hi> in <hi>bad,</hi> by reason of the Universal depravation of
Humane Nature. And let a man Prescribe to <hi>others</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so Excellent Rules of Life, if he <hi>himself</hi> be observed
not to <hi>walk</hi> by those Rules, he had e'en as good hold
his peace, for any <hi>good</hi> he is like to doe. This man's
<hi>Example</hi> is a Confutation of his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Advice;</hi>
and he ought to expect no <hi>other</hi> Reply to it but <hi>this,
Cur verba audio, cum facta videam, What regard is to be
had to thy</hi> Words, <hi>when they are so contradicted by thy</hi>
Practice? And, above all, the bad Examples of <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi>
and <hi>Ministers, Parents</hi> and <hi>Masters of Families,</hi>
and <hi>Instructers of Youth,</hi> and of People that are noted for
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> or for the <hi>Profession of Religion</hi> (as hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
been shewed) have the <hi>most</hi> Malign and Fatal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.</p>
            <p>I will single the bad Example of <hi>Parents</hi> out of all
<hi>these.</hi> It is a plain case, that the Wickedness of the
World is <hi>mostly</hi> owing to the Examples of <hi>Drunkenness,
Swearing, Profanation of the Lords day,</hi> and of a <hi>Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and Irreligious life,</hi> that are given by Parents to
their Children. And 'tis very rare when Parents are
<hi>bad,</hi> but their Children take after them; and imitate
them especially in <hi>those</hi> Vices, which they observe <hi>them</hi>
to be most addicted to. By <hi>which</hi> means, by that time
they are grown up to years of Discretion, they are so
<hi>habituated</hi> to Sinning, that though they afterwards
should be so happy, as to light into the Families of <hi>Pious</hi>
people, and <hi>so</hi> want neither good <hi>Advice,</hi> nor good <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi>
they are found to be generally Unreclaimable:
And <hi>so,</hi> when <hi>these</hi> too come to have <hi>Children, their</hi>
Example proves likewise <hi>as</hi> Pernicious to <hi>them;</hi> and by
this means Wickedness is still Propagated and Encreased,
from Generation to Generation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49332:19"/>But let all <hi>such</hi> Parents know that, as none are <hi>more</hi>
concerned than themselves, in the fearfull <hi>Woe</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in my Text, against those <hi>by whom Offences come,</hi> so
may they expect the bitter <hi>Curses</hi> of their dear <hi>Children,</hi>
sooner or later in <hi>this</hi> World, but especially in that <hi>to
come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall conclude all with a few words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
               <note place="margin">This was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament-day.</note>
This being an Ordinance most <hi>plainly,</hi> and in most <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi>
terms, instituted by our Blessed Lord, it must needs
be a great <hi>Offence</hi> and Scandal, in those that Profess the
Religion of our Saviour, to live in the <hi>constant</hi> neglect
of it. And by the same reason that any man doeth <hi>this,</hi>
he may cast off, with the mad <hi>Ranters,</hi> all <hi>other</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
And I must add, that to come to the Lord's
Table, but <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice</hi> in a <hi>Year,</hi> or very <hi>seldom,</hi> is a
great <hi>Offence</hi> and Scandal too. And a man may every
whit as well, but <hi>seldom</hi> attend upon the <hi>other</hi> Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as omit, without apparent necessity, the Receiving
of the <hi>Lord's Supper, whensoever</hi> he is presented with an
<hi>Opportunity,</hi> and is <hi>invited</hi> thereunto. If <hi>Communicating</hi>
be a Duty, <hi>Frequent</hi> Communicating is so too; and
there is the <hi>same</hi> reason for doing it as often, as <hi>well</hi> we
can, that there is why we should doe it <hi>at all.</hi> The
<hi>First</hi> Christians were very <hi>sensible</hi> of <hi>this,</hi> and therefore
'twas their practice to Receive the <hi>Holy Communion,
whensoever</hi> they <hi>met</hi> to Worship God. And <hi>he</hi> that shall
think that <hi>once</hi> in a <hi>Month</hi> is too often to perform this
Duty, whensoever he is perswaded to doe it, I think it
no breach of Charity to say, he is far from being <hi>duly</hi>
Qualified for it. An Affecting Sense of the Infinite
Love of God in Christ, and Holy Resolutions to Walk,
by the assistance of his Grace, <hi>Worthy</hi> of that Love, are
<hi>necessary</hi> Qualifications for this Ordinance: But how is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49332:19"/>
it possible, that <hi>he</hi> who hath <hi>this Sense,</hi> and <hi>these Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,</hi>
can think he can too often <hi>Express</hi> this <hi>Sense</hi> at
the Lord's Table, or <hi>there</hi> get these <hi>Resolutions</hi> more
and more <hi>Confirmed, where</hi> Grace is received for that
purpose, by all those that seriously, and with a sincere
Design, come unto it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But whereas there are those very Honest People, who
are neither wanting in good Resolutions, nor in good
Endeavours, that are discouraged from coming to the
Lord's Table, as often as they would; because they find,
to their grief,</hi> their Thoughts much disordered oftentimes,
and ther Affections dull and heavy; and their Power fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
mightily short of their Will and Desires, <hi>I will leave
with</hi> them <hi>what is said to the Christian that makes</hi> these
<hi>Complaints, in the</hi> Meditation before the
Sacrament, <hi>in the</hi>
               <note n="ast;" place="margin">For the Month of <hi>August.</hi>
               </note> Christian Sacrifice, <hi>viz.</hi>
Be assured that Christ pitieth thee, that,
notwithstanding this, he will kindly entertain thee; and
receive the poorest Oblation thou art able to make him at his
Table. Eat and be satisfied and Bless the name of the
Lord. He hath invited thee, He expects thee; He
loves to see thee there; and will make thee know that he
loves thee, and delights to doe thee good.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>God of all Mercy</hi> give us all his Grace, so to
demean our Selves in <hi>all</hi> our Relations, as that no damage
may accrue to the Souls of <hi>any,</hi> by <hi>our</hi> means; nor any
Dishonour to our Holy Profession: But that all that <hi>know</hi>
us, may have cause to Bless God for us; and we may <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things:</hi> To
whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be all Honour
and Glory, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
