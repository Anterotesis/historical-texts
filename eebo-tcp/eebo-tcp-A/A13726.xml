         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus it appeareth, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most an ilande, closed on the east side with the sea <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aticum,</hi> and on the southe and weast with the sea <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhenum,</hi> whiche is a parte of the great sea <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum.</hi> And from the North it hath the mightiest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of all Europe called <hi>Alpes,</hi> whiche diuideth it from all other regions.</p>

And I thinke verilie, that in one region of all the worlde againe, are not halfe so many straungers as in Italie: specially of gentilmen, whose resorte thither is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie vnder pretence of studie. For there are diuerse

Besidꝭ excellent maisters of musicke to syng and plaie on all maner of instrumentes, and the beste maisters of fence at all weapons that can be founde. So that all kyndes of vertue maie there be learned: and therfore are those places accordyngly furnisshed: not of suche studentes alone, as moste commonly are brought vp in our vniuersitees (meane mens children set to schole in ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>¶Fyrst, to reherse the conformitee of speeche that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest theim selfes (consideryng what a noumbre of diuersitees they haue in theyr tounge) it is a merualle, that in maner all gentilmen dooe speake the courtisane.

But this is out of doubt, a straunger can not be better entreteigned, nor more honourablie entreated than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the Italians.</p>
               <p>¶Thei are very modest in their apparaile, fine in trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of theyr houses, and excedyng nete at theyr table. But aboue all other they are sobre of speeche, enemies of ill reporte, and so tendre ouer their owne good name (whiche they call theyr honour) that who so euer spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ill of one of theim, shall die for it, if the partie sklaundered maie know it, and finde tyme and place to doe it. Wherof there is a vse growen amongest theim, that few gentilmen goe abroade vnarmed. And though some in this case dooe discommende theim, yet mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion dooeth rather allow than blame theim. For the feare of suche daungers maketh men so ware of theyr tounges, that a man maie goe .xx. yeres through Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie without findyng reproche or villanie, vnlesse he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke it hym selfe.</p>
               <p>¶And if one gentilman happen to defame an other, many tymes the defamed maketh his defiaunce by a writte called <hi>Cartello,</hi> and openly chalengeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famer to fight in campe: so that there are seen some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme woorthy trialles betwene theim.</p>
               <p>¶And it is true, that many yeres agoe, suche contenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:18978:8"/>
hath growen amongest theim, that almost the whole nacion hath been diuided into parttakynges, as <hi>Guelfi</hi> and <hi>Ghibellini</hi>: imperiall and frenche, with other lyke: whiche hath been occasion of muche manslaughter, and consequentlie of theyr foresaied continuall vse in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of armure. But at this daie those open conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions are wonderfully abated, whether it procede of werinesse or of wysedome I can not tell.</p>
               <p>¶Finally in one thyng I can singlerly commend them, that they woull not lightly meddle with other mens mattiers, and that whan they heare ill report, thei doe theyr best to couer the sklaunder, saiyng that no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth without fault: or with some other suche reason. But like as I coulde recken in the Italians commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion many thynges more than are here rehersed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen so on the other side if I were disposed to speake of vice, I might happen to finde a noumbre as ill as in any other men: whiche are better vntouched than spoken of. For wheras temperance, modestie, and other ciuile vertues excell in the numbre of the Italian nobilitee, more than in the nobilitee of any other nacion that I knowe: so vndoubtedly the fleshely appetite with vnnaturall heate and other thynges in theim that be viciouse, dooe passe all the termes of reason or honestie.</p>
               <p>¶And yet it is not to be forgotten, that these gentilmen generally professe three thynges: the fyrst is armes, to mainteigne withall his honour: the seconde is loue, to shew him selfe gentill and not cruell of nature: and the thyrde is learnyng, to be hable to know, to vnderstand, and to vtter his opinion in mattiers of weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note>¶The principall merchauntꝭ are for the most part gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilmen.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18978:8"/>
For whan there be of one house .iii. or .iiii. bretherne: lightly one or two of theim dispose them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes to merchaundise. And if they happen not to diuide theyr fathers patrimonie and substaunce (as many ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes thei dooe not) than dooe the merchauntes trauaile aswell for the wealth of theyr bretherne as theyr owne: for all renneth in common, be it gaine or losse. In deede theyr outwarde profession agreeth not with the gentilmen before rehersed. For they carie nother wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon nor armure, but dooe what thei can to liue in peace: not onely serching the trades of all countreis with their merchaundise, but also occupiyng at home the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanciall fermes and possessions by theyr factours, as hereafter more plainely it foloweth. And because these merchauntes haue nothyng the lesse reputacion of nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litee, for theyr trade of merchaundise, therfore it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there be suche numbres of wealthy men in that countrei, as the like is not to be founde any other where. For in diuerse citees of Italie it is no meruaile to see .xx. persones in a citee woorthe .100000. crownes a peece and vpwardꝭ.</p>
               <p>¶As for the artificers I haue nothyng to saie:<note place="margin">Artificers.</note> sauyng that for the most part thei are the finest woorkemen and best inuentours of all other, and are so well paied for it, that many of theim liue as well as they that haue stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng liuinges: and grow sometimes vnto great wealth and richesse, but not lightly in two or thre descentes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any reputacion of nobilitee.</p>
               <p>¶The housbandmen are of all handes oppressed.<note place="margin">Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> For in the countrey there dwelleth no man of substaunce. All the gentilmen and other that are wealthy, dwell in
<pb facs="tcp:18978:9"/>
the walled citees and townes: leauyng the villaiges, fieldes and pastures in theyr tenauntes handes, not to ferme at certaine rent as we dooe in Englande, but to the halfes, or to the thyrde of all graine and fruite as the grounde is fertile or baraine. And the poore te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt is bounde to till, sow and housbande the ground at his owne cost and charge. So that the landelordꝭ parte cometh clere without disbursyng of a penie. And at the haruest and vintaige the landelorde sendeth a man of his for his parte, who fyrste taketh his choise of the graine, wine, oyle, and fruite: and than leaueth the reste to the tenaunt as his parte ariseth to. And many tymes if the landelorde be cruell, whan he can not sell his thynges at his owne price, than forceth he his tenaunt to vtter it for hym: and to paie for it, not as he can sell it, but as the landelorde woull. By reason wherof the poore man is brought so low, that he is not hable sometyme to finde breade of <hi>Zorgo</hi> (a verie vile graine) to feede his poore children withall.</p>
               <p>¶And because I haue here named <hi>Zorgo,</hi> me thinketh it meete to tell, that in Italie groweth many sortes of graine, as this <hi>Zorgo, Meglio, Segala,</hi> and .xx. suche other, whiche can not be expressed by any englishe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, because in Englande there is no kynde of suche graine. All whiche serue to make course breadde for the poore people, and also for the staple of vitailes in stronge holdes. For the breadde made therof (speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of <hi>Meglio</hi>) woull endure a noumbre of yeres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted. And in like maner thei haue certaine kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of other graine, that in generall are called <hi>Legumi</hi> (as we were wonte to call peasen, lenten stuffe) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18978:9"/>
they vse all the yere longe to make theyr potages.</p>
               <p>¶Finally in the villages are many faire houses made onely for the owners passetime against the heate of the sommer. For than dooe thei habandon the citees and goe vnto those houses for a moneth two or three, where vnder the fresshe herbers, hedges and boowes, amongest the delicate fruites they triumph in as muche pleasure as maie be imagined. And for the most parte eche man hath his make: with some instrumentꝭ of musicke, and suche other thynges as serue for his recreacion. And if euer the tenaunt haue good daie, than lycketh he his lippes of his maisters leauynges.</p>

               <p>¶But in good earnest the gentilwomen generally, for gorgeouse atyre, apparaile and iewelles, excede (I thynke) all other women of our knowen worlde. I meane as well the courtisanes as the maried women. For in some places of Italie, speciallie where churche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe reigne: you shall finde of that sorte of women in riche apparaill, in furniture of householde, in seruice, in horse and hackeney, and in all thynges that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne

In deede many gates of the citee are of square stone, wrought after the most antike facion: so that it is not incredible, as <hi>Liuie</hi> writeth, that the walles haue been of square stone, but it should not seeme so, because that in makyng of a newe wall in the same place, it is to be supposed, the builders would haue vsed the olde square stone, rather than bricke.</p>

               <p>IT shalbe necessarie to declare, that there be .iii. kynde of pyllers, rounde, square, and stryped.

Of whiche bases there be .iiii. sundrie facions, <hi>Ionici, Dorici, Italici,</hi> and <hi>Corinthij,</hi> or <hi>Tusculani,</hi> as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> writeth. These kyndes of pyllers were so common amongeste the Romaynes, that almost he was no man, that had not a numbre of pyllers in his house, of white, red, or diuers coloured marble, or of porphyrie, or other like riche stone: for the graie is not accoumpted marble in Italie, but graie stone. So that to consider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite numbre of these pyllers that were in Rome, and that yet amongeste the olde ruines are to bee seene, it seemeth a wonder where they should be had, and what a treasure they coste.

               <p>¶The lyke cerymonies were vsed vnto all the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles that came, whether one came alone or many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gethers. And there taried more than .ii. houres har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenyng to this gunneshot and mery pipyng, and rekened aboue .40. Cardinalles that came thus rydyng, sometime one alone, and sometime .iii. or .iiii. together.</p>
               <p>¶There was no Cardinall that came without a great traine of gentilmen and prelates, well horsed and apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, some had .40. some .50. and some .60. or mo, and next before euerie of theim rode .ii. henchemen, the one cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng a coushin and a riche clothe, and the other a piller of syluer, and the Cardinalles theym selfes aparayled in robes of crymsen chamlet, with redde hattes on theyr heades, rode on moyles.</p>
               <p>¶Whan they were all come to the palaice, and had
<pb facs="tcp:18978:44"/>
waited awhile in the chaumbre of presence, the bysshop him selfe with the .iii. crowned miter full of iewelles, in a veraie riche cope, with shoes of crimsen veluette, secte with preciouse stones, and in all his other pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal apparaile, came foorth, and at the chambre dore sate him downe in a chaier of crymsen veluet, through the whiche reuneth two staues couered with the same. Thus beyng sette, the prelates and clergy, with the other offycers passed on afore hym. Whiche are suche a numbre, as were able to make the muster of a battail, if they were well ordred in the field, <hi>Dataries, Threasorers, Clerkes of the Chambre, Penitentiaries, Prebendaries, Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Protonotaries,</hi> and a thousande mo, eche order of theim in his diuers deuise of parliamente robes, all in skarlet, and for the moste parte finely furred. Than came the double crosse, the swoorde and the imperiall hatte, and after that the Cardinallꝭ by two and two, and betwene euery two a great route of gentilmen. Than came the ambassadours, and next theim the bishop hym selfe blessyng all the waie, and caried in his chayre by .viii. men clothed in longe robes of skarlet: and on either side of hym wente his garde makynge Rome, and criyng <hi>abasso abasso,</hi> for they that woull not willyngly kneele, shalbe made kneele by force. And I thynke verily the foremost of this ordre was distant from the hindermost more than a quarter of a myle.</p>
               <p>¶Thus whan he came into the middest of the churche against the sacrament of the aulter, he turned hym selfe towardes it, and bowyng his heade a little, seemed to make a certaine familiare reuerence.</p>
               <p>¶Than was he caried into the chapell, brought behind
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18978:44"/>
the aulter (for the aulter standeth in the middest open e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie waie) and there in a trone of wonderfull maiestee was set vp as a god.</p>
               <p>¶The Cardinallꝭ then bestowed them selfes after their auncientees in certaine stalles, somewhat lower about the queere. Than sate the Ambassadours, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prelates at theyr feete. And so whan they were set, the chapell beganne the offitorie of the masse, and sange so sweetely, that me thought I neuer heard the lyke. At the communion of the masse the Cardinall that celebrated, brake the host in .iii. peeces, wherof he eate one hym selfe, and the other two he deliuered vpon the paten to a Cardinall appoincted, that brought it to the bishop, and in his presence (for feare of poysonyng) toke assaie of the seconde peece: and deliuered hym the thyrde.</p>
               <p>¶Whan the masse was finisshed, the bishop gaue his benediction, with many yeres of pardon, and than retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the palaice in lyke ordre as he came.</p>
               <p>¶As for the pompe he vseth whan he rideth abroade, I nede not to speake of it, consideryng what I haue saied, sauyng that you shall vnderstande, how <hi>Corpus domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> is alwaies caried in a tabernacle before hym on a white hackeney, that is taught to kneele both at the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng vp, and also at the takyng downe of it.</p>
               <p>¶In dede the bishop for his owne ordinarie kepeth no great house, but his traine excedeth all that I haue seen. For euery Cardinall and prelate kepeth house accordyng to his habilitee, and some of theim are so precise, that if one of theyr retinewe be myssyng, whan they goe out of theyr dores, be it gentilman or other, he forfeiteth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb facs="tcp:18978:45"/>
peece of money, which he is constreigned forthwith to paie. And lightlie there is none of theym without iii. or .iiii. paiges trymmed like yonge prynces, for what purpose I wolde be loth to tell.</p>
               <p>¶If I shoulde saie, that vnder theyr longe robes they hyde the greattest pride of the worlde, it might happen some men wolde beleue it, but that thei are the vaynest men of all other, theyr owne acres doe well declare. For theyr ordinarie pastime is to disguise them selfes, to go laugh at the Courtisanes houses, and in the shrouyng tyme, to ryde maskyng about with theym, whiche is the occasion that Rome wanteth no iolie dames, speciallie the strete called <hi>Iulia,</hi> whiche is more than halfe a myle longe, fayre buylded on both sydes, in maner inhabited with none other but Courtisanes, some woorthe .x. and some woorthe .xx. thousande crownes more or lesse as theyr reputacion is. And many tymes you shall see a Courtisane ride into the countrey, with .x. or .xii. horse waityng on hir.</p>
               <p>¶Briefelie by reporte, Rome is not without .40000. har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lottes mainteigned for the moste parte by the clergy and theyr folowers. So that the Romaines theim selfes suffer theyr wifes to goe seldome abrode, either to chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che or other place, and some of theym scarcelie to looke out at a lattise wyndow, wherof theyr prouerbe saieth, <hi>Jn Roma vale piu la putana, che la moglie Romana,</hi> that is to saie, In Rome the harlotte hath a better life, than she that is a Romaines wife.</p>
               <p>¶In theyr apparaile thei are as gorgeouse as maie be, and haue in theyr goyng suche a solemne pace, as I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sawe. In conclusion to liue in Rome is more costly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18978:45"/>
than in any other place, but he that hath money maie haue there what him liketh. But now remaigneth to speake of the new buildynges.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18978:47"/>
Christes Apostles, after that he had sufficientlie confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the churche in <hi>Asia,</hi> and confuted the errour of those Christians that allowed circumsicion, came to Rome the seconde yere of Claudius Empire, and there was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the congregacion as bishop. In whiche office he ministred .25. yeres, and at last was crucified with the heade downewardes, the same daie that <hi>Paule</hi> the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle was beheaded, the laste yere of <hi>Neros</hi> reigne, and the 37. yere after Christes death.</p>
            <p>¶Contrariwyse manie learned men at these daies are of opinion, that <hi>Peter</hi> neuer came in <hi>Rome,</hi> groundyng them selfes vpon diuers reasons, as this. If <hi>Peter</hi> had commen thither, it coulde not haue been vnwriten in the holie scriptures, either by <hi>Luke</hi> in the actes of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelles, or elles by <hi>Paule</hi> in some of his epistelles. Or if Peter were of that age, that it shoulde seme he was at Christꝭ death, and after continued in <hi>Antioche</hi> and other places so manie yeres as is to be proued, it semeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possyble he shoulde come to Rome, and there liue .25. ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. Wherfore they saie, the ambiciouse bishops of Rome, to couer theyr vsurped auctoritee, haue feygned this comyng of <hi>Peter</hi> thither.</p>
            <p>¶But this is clere, that from Peter to <hi>Siluester</hi> they recken .33. bishops: whiche for the moste parte were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, and many of theym martyred by the emperours officers. So that in maner they alwaies kept theim selfes out of sight, preachyng and ministryng secretlie without pompe astate or solemne ceremonie. But from the tyme of <hi>Siluester</hi> hitherwardes, as they grewe in wealthe, so encreased theyr worldely maiestee and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, as hereafter more plainely appeareth.</p>

               <hi>SIluester</hi> the fyrst of that name, after he had been a certaine space in the hill <hi>Soratto,</hi> now called <hi>Monte di San Siluestro,</hi> where for feare of persecucion, he hydde hym selfe, hearyng of the good inclinacion that the emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the fyrst was of, towardes Christian religion, came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and so discretely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued him selfe that the emperour was conuerted to the right faieth, and baptised.</p>
            <p>¶Some write, that the occasion therof proceded of a myracle doen on <hi>Constantine,</hi> in recoueryng his health from the leaprie. But <hi>Platina</hi> thynketh that to be a fable, and in maner proueth it, thynkyng rather it proceded of the signe of the crosse, that <hi>Constantine</hi> did see in the firmament, vnder whiche he was promysed victorie, and so cariyng a redde crosse in his standarde before hym, he ouercame his enemie <hi>Maxentius,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he gaue eare to <hi>Siluesters</hi> preachyng, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted. But what so euer the occasion was, it is agreed, that <hi>Siluester</hi> baptised Constantine, who being christened, turned many of the gentiles temples to Christian chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: enduyng theim with ornamentes and possessions.</p>
            <p>¶Not longe after, leauyng <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Siluester</hi> and his successours, as the clergie saie, <hi>Constantine</hi> wente to dwell at <hi>Bizantium,</hi> whiche he had than newly reedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, callyng it <hi>Constantinople</hi> after his owne name. So that from thensfoorth the Christian faieth began to

flourishe ouer all the worlde: and therfore most part of all Christian churches sent to the bishops of Rome to learne of them the cerimonies and ordres necessary to be vsed in the churche, by reason wherof the emperours beyng residente elswhere, the Romayne bishops grewe in such reputacion, that at lengthe they became empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours theym selfes.</p>

            <p>¶This <hi>Damasus</hi> was afterwardꝭ accused of adultery: and therfore called .40. bishops together, and cleryng him selfe of the cryme, not onelie punished his accusers, but also made a decree, <hi>Sub poena tallionis,</hi> that none of the clergie from thensefoorth shuld be accused: whiche
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18978:49"/>
               <hi>Poena tallionis</hi> condemneth the accuser to the payne of the accusacion, in case he prouet it not.</p>

            <p>¶Than came Edmonde sonne of Charles the .iiii. em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to Rome, and there with great solenmitee and pompe receiued the imperiall crowne of Eugenie, and retourned into his countrey without attemptyng any thyng of importaunce.</p>
            <p>¶Not longe after the Duke of Mylaine made warre against the bishop, and sent <hi>Nicolas Fortebraccio</hi> with a great noumbre of chosen men to Rome: who arriued there with so muche diligence, that he passed <hi>Ponte Molle,</hi> and came to the gate <hi>Flaminia,</hi> ere euer the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop was ware of hym.</p>
            <p>¶This <hi>Nicolas Fortebraccio</hi> had serued the bishoppe before in a certaine enterprise that was made at <hi>Vetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> and <hi>Ciuita Vecchia</hi>: and because he had gotten there
<pb facs="tcp:18978:71"/>
many fayre booties, therfore at his retourne the bishop refused to paie hym his wages, saiyng, that his fayre gayue ought to suffise hym. For the whiche Nicolas departed: and now retournyng vnder the Duke of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, with helpe of the <hi>Colonnesi,</hi> encouraged the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines so to chalenge theyr libertee, that Eugenie was faine to disguise hym selfe in a monkes habite, and to take his bote towardes <hi>Ostia.</hi> And yet ere he were farre onwardes on his waie, the people hearyng of his departure folowed hym downe the riuer, with hurlyng of stones and shotte of arrowes: and than created new magistrates after theyr owne maner, deposyng and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng awaie all suche as had ought to doe in the bishops name: and laied siege vnto <hi>Castel Sant' Angelo,</hi> whiche was all theyr vndooyng. For the capitaine therof wrought this policy, he sent his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foorth daily to skyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe, and ordeined certaine of them to suffre them selfꝭ to be taken: who for theyr libertee and money withall, shoulde promyse to slea theyr capitaine, and to betraie the castell. It came to passe as it was deuised, so that after theyr returne to the castell,<note place="margin">A wittie policie.</note> thei shewed out a dead mans head, and requyryng theyr money offered to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vp the castell. Whervpon certaine of the principall Romaines entred, and so beyng taken, were occasion that within the space of .v. monethes after the Romai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes returned to theyr former obedience: the bishop than beyng at Florence.</p>
            <p>¶This meane while the princꝭ and prelates of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome beganne to assemble for kepyng of the generall counsaile at Basile: and by one agreement cited .iii. ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Eugenie to come thither, with his Cardinalles.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18978:71"/>
And because he came not, they threatned to depose hym. Wherfore he sent his apostolicall bulles thyther with certaine Cardinalles to confyrme all thynges there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</p>
            <p>¶Than sent he the Patriarke <hi>Vitelesco</hi> to Rome, who there vsed many cruell tourmentes and deathes against the enemies of Eugenie: and after went into the realme of Naples: pretendyng title therunto in the churches right. In whiche quarell he fought with the prince of <hi>Taranto,</hi> and toke hym prisoner with two thousand horse: and missed little of takyng the kyng Alfonse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of truese.</p>
            <p>¶In his retourne to Rome he vtterly destroied <hi>Prene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,</hi> the chiefe towne belongyng to the house of <hi>Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>: but at last his chaunce was to be betraied and slain hym selfe.</p>
            <p>¶After this Eugenie called a counsaile in <hi>Ferrara,</hi> wherunto <hi>Iohn Paleologo</hi> emperour of Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with the principall of the greeke churche came, and disputed certaine articles of religion, whiche were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon in the counsaile folowyng at Florence. And all be it, that Eugenie had great assemblies at both these counsailes, yet were there a noumbre of bishops, that sate still at <hi>Basile,</hi> alwaies sommonyng Eugenie to repayre thither: and at last for lacke of apparance (part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through instaunce of Philip Duke of Mylaine, than enemie to Eugenie) the counsaile of <hi>Basile</hi> deposed him, and created in his place one <hi>Amideus,</hi> than beyng an heremite, that before had been Duke of Sauoie: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng hym Felix. By reason whereof Christendome was diuided into .iii. partes: Two helde with these .ii.
<pb facs="tcp:18978:72"/>
bishops, and the .iii. with nother of bothe.</p>
            <p>¶Than retourned Eugenie vnto Rome, where he was ioyfully receiued of the people, and lodged the fyrste night at the gate <hi>Flaminia</hi>: but the seconde daie, as he went in <hi>Pontificalibus</hi> towarde sainct Peters, because the custome of the citee was reysed double, the people beganne to crie, downe with the customes, and with the inuentours of theim: so that the bishop was faine to promyse theim it should be no more leuied.</p>
            <p>¶Shortly after he made warre in the Marke of <hi>Anco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and recouered it out of the handes of <hi>Francesco Sforza</hi>: and finally prouoked <hi>Charles</hi> than Dolphin of Fraunce, by plaine force to driue awaie the bishops that helde the counsaile at <hi>Basile</hi>: and so remaigned in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state till he died.</p>

that came on the frenche parte, shotte of his artillerie amongest the thickest, and slewe a multitude aswell of his friendes as enemies: but thei were all straungers to hym.</p>
            <p>¶In conclusion the Frenchemen toke <hi>Rauenna,</hi> with diuers other citees of the bishops, whiche they enioyed not longe.

            <p>¶Some ill was suspected of hym for his to muche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licatenesse in bringyng vp of children, and for his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of immortalitee.</p>
            <p>¶Adrian the .vii. by contencion amongest the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles happened to be elected,<note place="margin">Adrian .7.</note> reputed of theim for an ignoraunt man, though some other had a good opinion bothe of his vertue and learnyng. But because his life was nothyng courtely, or agreable to the Cardinalles, either through gods visitacion, or (as most men thinke) thoroughe theyr poyson practises, he was soone dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched.</p>
            <p>¶Clement the .vii. brother,<note place="margin">Cleme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> vnto Leo the .x. immediately after his election, toke parte with the Frenche kyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the emperour. So that, whan the frenche king was taken before <hi>Pauia,</hi> the family of <hi>Colonna,</hi> which hath ben alwaies imperiall, through helpe of <hi>Don Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Moncada,</hi> beganne to warre with the bishop: and after diuers subtill practises and persuasions, so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the mattier, that they entred into Rome, and missed but a little to haue taken the bishop: who hearyng the rumour, sodeinly fled to <hi>Castel Sant' Angelo.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the bishop had drawen <hi>Don Hugo Monca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> to his parte, the <hi>Colonnesi</hi> endured cruell warre to theyr great domage.</p>
            <p>¶Than came the Duke of Bourbone, who was slaine with the shotte of an handgun from the wallꝭ of Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the emperours armie, wherof he was capitaine, toke the citee by assault, sacked, spoyled, and burned it: and for the space of .xv. daies vsed suche triumph, that for theyr passetyme thei woulde make suche Cardinallꝭ and prelates as were theyr prisoners, ride scornefully about the towne vpon asses, with theyr faces to the tayle: and so streictly besieged Clement, that he was faine to geue
<pb facs="tcp:18978:77"/>
theim .400000. dukates for his raunsome, and to yeld the castell into the emperours handes.</p>
            <p>¶But within lesse than .iii. yeres after, the emperour came him selfe into Italie, and hauing made peace with the bishop, receiued of hym the imperiall crowne in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi> with so great triumph and pompe, that the like hath not been hearde of in our daies. Duryng the whiche there came ambassadours to Clement with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from Preter Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great commendacions, desyre of amitee, and vnion of religion.</p>
            <p>¶Before theyr departure from <hi>Bononia,</hi> the emperour graunted the bishop his armie against the Florentines, and concluded the mariage of his bastarde daughter to Clementes nephiew, <hi>Alexander di Medici,</hi> that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes was Duke of Florence. But ere the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines would lose theyr libertees, they susteigned a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble warre for the space of .xii. monethes.</p>
            <p>¶And lyke as by force he oppressed the Florentines, so by treason he subdued <hi>Ancona.</hi> For vnder pretence of amitee and counsaile, persuadyng them that the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes armie by sea, was comyng against theim, he sent a capitaine of his, called <hi>Bernardin,</hi> who with certaine men of warre was receiued into the citee, and so vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the dominion for the churche.</p>
            <p>¶In this bishops tyme happened suche a sodeine rage of water in Rome, that the high toures were drowned, and a great numbre of people, with infinite richesse lost: so that the bishop hym selfe had muche adooe to escape it: whiche maie well be thought a plage of god, sent for the abhominacion that reigneth there.</p>
            <p>¶Finally Clement mette with the frenche kynge at
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18978:77"/>
Marseiles in Prouaunce, and there concluded the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage that folowed betwene Katherine Clementꝭ neece, and Henrie now frenche kyng, than but secounde sonne to the frenche kynge. Shortly after whose mariage Clement died.</p>
            <p>¶Paule the .iii. that now is bishop,<note place="margin">Paulus .3.</note> before the tyme of his election, helde hym selfe so indifferent betwene the factions imperiall and frenche, that no man could know to whether part he was most inclined.</p>
            <p>¶In the beginnyng of his tyme he procured all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian princes to warre against the Turke, so that the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that Uenetians, and he made an armie by sea vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leadyng of <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> who mette with <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barossa</hi> besydes <hi>Corfu,</hi> but they foughte no battaile, though the Christians were more in noumbre and better furnisshed than the Turkes: whether <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> were blame woorthy I can not tell. But ones the Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian <hi>Galeon,</hi> a notable shippe, was lefte alone in the middest of the Turkishe nauie, that assaulted hir .iiii. or v. houres, and yet at length came cleane awaie in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite of theim all.</p>
            <p>¶This bishop went to <hi>Nisa</hi> in Prouaunce, where by his procurement the emperour and frenche kyng mette, and concluded a peace, whiche dured not longe.</p>
            <p>¶Than died the Duke of Urbine. Incontinently v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon whose death, the bishop made warre to the younge Duke <hi>Guido Vbaldo</hi> for the state of <hi>Camerino,</hi> and constreigned him for a little summe of money to geue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the astate. In in whiche the bishoppe establisshed his owne sonne <hi>Pietro Aluigi</hi> Duke.</p>
            <p>¶After this vppon a light occasion the bishoppe made
<pb facs="tcp:18978:78"/>
warre to <hi>Ascanio Colonna,</hi> thiefe of that familie: and <hi>Peter Aluigi,</hi> beyng generall of the bishops army, handled <hi>Ascanio Colonna</hi> and his adherentes so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly, that they were faine to abandone theyr owne tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and castelles, and to liue in exile as banished men, till by the emperours meanes they were restored to the bishops fauour and absolucion.</p>
            <p>¶This Paule, to exalte his owne bloudde, by consent of his Cardinalles exchaunged the Duchie of <hi>Cameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> with the churche, for the citees and territories of <hi>Placentia</hi> and <hi>Parma.</hi> Wherof he inuested his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named son as Duke: whose behauiour was suche, that he continued not fully two yeres: for the nobilitee of the same, detestyng his wicked life and tyrannie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyred against hym, and slew hym in his owne house in <hi>Placentia</hi>: yeldyng that citee the next daie into the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours handes.</p>
            <p>¶The bishop sent a fayre armie bothe of horsemen and footemen, to succcour the emperour in his enterprise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Germaines: and made his sonnes sonne, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Duke <hi>Ottauio</hi> generall.</p>
            <p>¶Finally he is a great astronomer, and so olde a man, that (as thei saie) for the most part he is nourished with the sucke of a womans breastꝭ: and to helpe his colde nature, hath two younge girles to lie by hym in his bedde a nightꝭ.</p>

And yet men (constreigned of necessitee) haue brought this marishe to suche a passe, that it is now not onely excedyng full of people, and riche of treasure and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynges: but so holesome withall (throughe the muche haunte of people and the great noumbre of continuall fyres) that I thynke none other citee hable to shewe so

many olde men. But were it not, that as it seemeth nature hath of purpose made a banke two or thre miles of, betwene it and the sea, it were impossible to be enha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited: Because the citee standyng equall with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the floudde by reason should passe through the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at euery full sea.

For euerie chanell (as who woulde saie euery streete) is full of water, and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels are so many, that you maie row through all partes of the citee: though there be waies also, to goe on land if you list.

And in the marisshe, betwene the citee and the maine lande, whan the water is low, the most parte of the chanels are so shalow, that the botes haue muche a dooe to passe to and fro. For the mudde encreaseth daiely, by reason of the lande flouddes, that a noumbre of riuers fallyng into the same, dooe carie with theim.

               <head>Of buildynges.</head>
               <p>NExte vnto the situacion, the maner of theyr buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng is most to be meruailed at. For almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man that buildeth an house, maketh his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion lower than the water: and er euer he set in hand withall, is constreigned to make suche a stronge pale of pyles and mudde betwene his buildyng and the water, as shall be hable to defende his woorke, whan (after he hath closed it well) the water and mudde that resteth within, is clensed and emptied out. Than causeth he stronge pyles of timber of a great length, to be driuen in, and therupon with stone and grauell beginneth his foundacion. So that whan he hath brought it to the full sea marke, he rekenneth to haue furnished one halfe of his buildyng: notwithstandyng that aboue water I thynke no place of all Europe, hable at this daie to compare with that citee for numbre of sumptuouse hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, specially for theyr frontes. For he that woull rowe throughe the <hi>Canale grande,</hi> and marke well the
<pb facs="tcp:18978:84"/>
frontes of the houses on bothe sydes, shall see theim, more lyke the doynges of princes than priuate men. And I haue been with good reason persuaded, that in Uenice be aboue .200. palaices able to lodge any kyng.</p>
               <p>¶But now to the particuler of theyr notable buildyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: The new Castell, at the mouthe of the hauen <hi>Lio,</hi> for strengthe and beautie is one of the rarest thynges dooen in these daies.</p>
               <p>¶The churche of S. Marke is a verie antike thyng, furnisshed with goodly pillers of fine marble, to the noumbre of .900. (as they saie) besides the floore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote of small marble stones, wrought in knottes of diuers colours, and foure faire brasen horses ouer the fronte.</p>
               <p>¶The Dukes palaice is a verie sumptuouse buildyng, and not yet finished.</p>
               <p>¶The streete called, <hi>La Piazza di San Marco,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fayre and large, and the one syde is built of harde stone, all vniformely with faire glasen wyndowes, and the streete by low, paued ouer with bricke.</p>
               <p>¶Saincte Markes steeple is a veraie hyghe and fayre toure of bricke, so well built, that within foorth an horse maie be ledde vp vnto the bellfroy.</p>
               <p>¶The <hi>Rialto</hi> is a goodly place in the hert of the citee, where the merchauntes twyse a daie assemble.</p>
               <p>¶The schooles of S. Rocke and S. Marke, are two notable thynges: the frontes wherof are the fayrest and costliest that euer I haue seen.</p>
               <p>¶Finally, the <hi>Arsenale</hi> in myne eie excedeth all the rest: For there they haue well neere two hundred ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys in suche an ordre, that vpon a verie small warnyng
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18978:84"/>
they maie be furnisshed out vnto the sea. Besydes, that for euerie daie in the yere (whan they woulde goe to the cost) they shoulde be hable to make a new galey: hauyng suche a staple of tymber (whiche in the water within <hi>Th'arsenale</hi> hath lien a seasonyng, some .20. yere, some .40. some an .100. and some I wote not how longe) that it is a wonder to see it. And euery of these galeys hath his coueryng or house by hym selfe on the drie lande: so that the longe liyng vnoccupied can not hurt theim. Their mastes, cables, sailes, ankers, roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ores, and euery other thyng are redy in houses of offices by theim selfes, that vnseen it is almost incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: with suche a quantitee of artillerie, bothe for sea and lande, as made me to wonder, besides the harneyse and weapons, that suffise (as they saie) to arme an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>00000. men. Finally the noumbre of woorkemen waged for terme of life about those exercises, is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull. For by all that I could learne, theyr ordinarie is neuer lesse than .600. woorkyng in the <hi>Arsenale,</hi> be it peace or warre. And because thei haue suche a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of botemen, that continually liue by gaine vpon the water within the citee: they neede not to seeke further for mariners to furnishe their galeys withall. For it was crediblie tolde me, that there are no lesse than 12000. botes daiely seruyng in those theyr chanelles: and almost no bote rowed, but of a sufficient mariner. So that if the Uenetians had ben men, as the Romains were, geuen as well vnto chiualrie by lande, as vnto the exercise on the water: no doubt thei might many yeres agoen haue subdued the worlde. But sure theyr power hath been more warely gouerned, than valiantly enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
<pb facs="tcp:18978:85"/>
For sens Constantinople was gotten by the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, theyr dominion hath decreased, bothe by reason (as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame gothe) they rather practise with money, to bie and sell countreys, peace and warre: than to exercise deedes of armes: and for that moste Uenetians are at these daies become better merchauntes than men of warre.</p>
               <p>¶And now methynketh it conuenient to speake in this place, of the armorie that is in an hall of the Dukes pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, called <hi>La Sala del Consiglio d'i dieci,</hi> whiche sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a verie notable thyng.</p>
               <p>¶There be (as thei recken) a thousande cotes of plate, parte couered with clothe of golde and veluette, with gilte nayles so fayre, that princes myght weare theim: besides diuers other fayre harneyses made of late, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are bestowed in so fayre an ordre, with theyr dyuers kyndes of weapons, furnisshed of the beste sorte, that a great while lookyng on, could not satisfie me. This hall is diuided into diuers seuerall porcions, as the hous dooeth geue it, and euery porcion hath his sorte by him selfe verie handsomely.</p>
               <p>¶Finally for prouision of fresshe water it is a wonder to see theyr noumbre of costly welles, made onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the raine that falleth from the houses. I call theim costly, because fyrst euery well hath his bottome as low as the salt water, and must therfore be so surely walled and stopped with sande on the vtter syde, that it defende the salte water from sokyng in. And on the inner side it must haue his vent to receiue the water, that falleth from the houses, grauell within to passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and last of all a fayre pauyng of bricke or stone
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18978:85"/>

                  </gap>e, to preserue the purged water.</p>
               <p>¶And though they haue a great noumbre of those wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and plentie of raine, yet the poore men, that dwell in the countrey, doe gaine yerely aboue .20000. crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by bringyng theyr botes laden with fresshe water from the riuers to Uenice. Yet all this notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, you shall many tymes heare muche lamentacion amonge the poore folke for lacke of water.</p>

               <p>AS I haue been crediblie enformed by some gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilmen Uenetians, that haue had to dooe therin, they leauey of theyr subiectes little lesse than .4. millions of golde by the yeere, whiche (after our olde reckenyng) amounteth to the summe of tenne hundred thousande poundes sterlyng. A thyng rather to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at than beleeued, consideryng they reyse it not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon landes, but vpon customes after so extreme a sorte, that it would make any honest herte sorowfull to heare it. For there is not a graine of corne, a spoonefull of wine, a corne of salte, egge, byrde, beast, foule, or fisshe bought or solde, that paieth not a certaine custome. And in Uenice specially the customers part in many thyngꝭ, is more than the owners. And if any thyng be taken by the waie vncustomed, be it merchaundise or other, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so great or small, it is forfeited. For those custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers kepe suche a sorte of prollers to serche all thyngꝭ as they come to and fro, that I thynke Cerberus was neuer so greedie at the gates of hell as they be in the chanelles about Uenice. And though thei in serchyng a bote, finde no forfeiture, yet woull they not departe without drinkyng money. And many times the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest labourer or craftesman throughout all theyr domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, paieth a rate for the Poll by the moneth.

               <p>¶There be about .200. families of name, as <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini, Morosini, Donati, Badoeri, Foscari,</hi> and suche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: of whiche families be welneere the noumbre of 2500. gentilmen. And all they that are of the age of 25. and vpwardes, dooe entre into the great counsaile: the ordre of whose admission into the same is: Whan a gentilman is growen vnto .20. yeere olde, his father or friendes dooe present him vnto the <hi>Auogadori,</hi> who taketh his name, and with other names of the same sort, putteth it into a boxe, vntill the .iiii. of Decembre: beyng the daie appoincted, that all they of that age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorte vnto the Duke, vnto whom (besides this boxe) there is brought an other boxe, with so many balles, as the names amount vnto: of whiche euery fifte ball is golde, and all the rest siluer. Than taketh the Duke a bill out of one boxe, and a ball out of an other, and if the bill meete with a golden ball, than is that gentilman allowed: and if he meete not, than must he abide a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter chaunce the next yere, orels the age of .25.</p>
               <p>¶This foresaied great counsaile maie be lykened to our parliament: For vnto it manie mattiers of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce are appealed, and that that it dooeth, is vnrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable. By it all offices are geuen. And into it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18978:88"/>
the Duke, and all the other officers. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there passe so many thyngꝭ through that great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile (specially offices) that ordinarily euerie holidaie, and many times the worken daies, the same sitteth from diner till nyght. The ordre beyng this.</p>
               <p>¶Thei haue an hall verie fayre and large, in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parte wherof, at the tone ende, sitteth the Duke with certaine counsailours. And ouer against hym at the other ende the <hi>Cai</hi>: and on the sides the <hi>Auogado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> with the other magistrates. Than in the body of the hall there be tenne longe benches from the one ende therof vnto the other, and so made, that the gentilmen maie sitte by two rewes on a benche backe to backe. And so euery man beyng set, in what place it shal please him to take at his comyng in, the doores are shutte: and the chauncellour standeth vp, and readeth the office that is voide, with the names of theim that desyre it: and he that in the election hath most ballottes (so that they passe the halfe noumbre) is admitted officer. If there be none that hath more than halfe the voices as of a 1000. to haue .501: than is the election put ouer till an other daie. This maner of geuyng theyr voices by ballotte, is one of the laudablest thynges vsed amongest theim. For there is no man can knowe what an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dooeth.</p>
               <p>¶The boxes are made with an holow place at the top, that a man maie put in his hand, and at the ende of that place hange .ii. or .iii. boxes, into whiche he will, he maie let fall his ballot, that no man can perceiue hym. If there be but two boxes (as commonly it is in electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the one saieth yea, and the other saieth naie: And
<pb facs="tcp:18978:89"/>
if there be .iii. boxes (whiche for the most part hapneth in cases of iudgement) the one saieth yea, thother saith naie, and the thyrde saieth nothyng: and they are all well enough knowen by theyr dyuers colours. By this ordre of ballottyng they procede in iudgement tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all offices, vpon all maner of causes: beyng re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a soueraigne preseruacion of iustice. For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes the iudges maie graunt theyr voyces, and neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse (whan thei come to the hearyng of the mattier) dooe as theyr consciences shall leade theim: aunswea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng afterwardes, that thei did theyr best, but thei could not preuaile.</p>
               <p>¶Finally in the disposyng of theyr offices thei vse this ordre: that all offices of preeminence, as of the <hi>Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> that are before rehersed, or the beeyng <hi>Potestate, Capitaine,</hi> or <hi>Gouernour</hi> of any citee, castell, towne, or countrey, maie be geuen to none other, but vnto gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilmen Uenetians. All offices, that be vnder comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, as chauncellour, secretaries, and suche others, are bestowed amongest theyr best knowen citesins. For though there be many of those offices of commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment verie profitable, yet can no gentilman haue the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite therof. Either because they woull mainteyne in theyr personages a certeine maiestee, with theyr ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertee, or els because they woull aduoide the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that maie growe of perpetuitee. For all maner of gentilmens offices, from the highest to the lowest (the Dukes dignitee onely excepted) ar remouable, some fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yere to yere, some euery .ix. monethes, some more, some lesse (for no gentilman maie longe enioie one office): So all offices, that appertaine vnto theyr citesins, are dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18978:89"/>
for terme of liue without any chaunge.</p>
               <p>¶Amongest all other, this notable ordre thei haue, that two gentilmen of one familie can not be in one magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate or hygh office together at ones. By reason wherof those gentilmen, that of one name are fewest in numbre, grow a great deale sooner and oftner to autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritee, than they that be of the most: whiche is thought a wonderfull helpe of their vnitee and concorde. For if many of one name shoulde rule at ones, they might happen so to agree, that it should be an vndoyng of their common wealthe.</p>

               <head>¶Of the proctours and treasure.</head>
               <p>THere be certeine principall officers, whiche shulde seeme exempted from theyr common wealth, and be neuerthelesse headꝭ of the same, that is to were xii. of the principallest called <hi>Procuratori di San Marco,</hi> out of whiche numbre the Duke is alwaie chosen: and those haue theyr offices for terme of life, with a certeine stipende of an hundreth dukates a yere, or there about. Theyr charge is, seme to gouerne the reuenewes and treasure of the common wealth, and some the rentes and treasure of saincte Markes churche.</p>
               <p>¶As for the treasure of theyr common wealth I could neuer fynde the meane to see it: but I haue been credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie enformed, that it is a great summe of readie money locked vp in chestes, (that no man maie come at) whiche is sometyme more and sometyme lesse, as theyr wealth or charges encrease. And thoughe theyr reuenewe be
<pb facs="tcp:18978:90"/>
verie great, yet consideryng the often warres that they haue, the great wages that the senatours and officers receiue, the noumbre of straunge capitaines that they wage for terme of life, the noumbre of castels and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses that they maintaine, fortified with watche and warde, theyr continuall costly buildynges, and finally the vnreasonable charge of theyr <hi>Arsenale,</hi> and of their galeys abrode, I thynke they can not laie vp any great some at the yeres ende.</p>
               <p>¶The other treasure of sainct Markes churche, I haue seen: the principall thing wherof is a table on the high aulter, plated ouer with siluer, grauen and enameled, and set full of preciouse stones of all sortes. And than in a little stronge corner on the southsyde of the churche are certeine plates of golde muche lyke womens parte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes set full of riche stones, a goodly imperiall crowne for theyr Duke, two fayre vnicornes hornes, and diuers other thynges, the value wherof consisteth onely in the preciouse stones: For the golde that is about theim is but small in quantitee, but the stones are many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre, excellent great and fayre, and almost inestimable of price.</p>
               <p>¶Finally to retourne vnto the Proctours, theyr repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion is the greatest next the Dukes, and there is none can clymbe vnto that dignitee, but either he must be so woorthy, auncient and notable a man, as fewe lyke are to be founde amongest theim: or els so riche, that in time of neede he hath before his election releaued the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth with the lone of a notable summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Whiche seconde sort of election is also commen vppe of late, sens money (as some saie) hath entred in more reputacion than vertue.</p>

               <head>¶Of lawes.</head>
               <p>THeyr aduocates (as we shoulde saie our men of law) studie principally the ciuile lawes, and besy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that the statutes and customes of the citee: whiche are so many, that in maner they suffise of theim selfes. But he that substancially considereth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of theyr procedynges, shall plainly see, that all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers are determined by the iudges consciences, and not by the ciuile, nor yet by theyr owne lawes. For in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery office there be dyuers iudges, and that parte that hath most ballottes, preuaileth euer: be it in mattier of debt, of title of lande, vpon life and death, or otherwise. And in euery triall of thefte, murder, or suche other, the partie hym selfe is neuer suffred to speake. But there be certeine aduocates waged of the common reuenewe, whiche with no lesse studie pleade in their defence, than the <hi>Auogadori,</hi> in the contrarie. One daie the <hi>Auo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gador</hi> cometh into the courte, and laieth against the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon that, that either by examinacion, by torture, or by witnesse hath been proued: And an other daie cometh in th'aduocate, and defendeth the felon with the best aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare he can deuise: so that many tymes the prisoner tarieth .ii.iii. and sometyme .iiii. yeres, er euer he come vnto his triall of life and death.</p>
               <p>¶This ordre they obserue in Uenice onely. For out of Uenice the gentilman Uenetian, that is <hi>Potestate</hi> of the citee, towne, or place, hath absolute power to iudge vpon all mattiers hym selfe alone: how be it euery of theim, hath a counsaile of learned men, to aduise hym what the law commaundeth. Besides that, euery .v.
<pb facs="tcp:18978:91"/>
yeres there be certaine inquisitours, called <hi>Sindici,</hi> sent foorth to refourme extorcions, and all other thyngꝭ that they finde amisse, throughout theyr whole dominion.</p>
               <p>¶Finally there is a law in Uenice, that no gentilman Uenetian maie speake with any ambassadour, without licence of the <hi>Signoria,</hi> for feare of intelligence, or of daungerouse practise. And because they feare, least ciuile sedicion might be the destruction of their common wealth, as of dyuers other it hath been, therefore thei haue prouided an ordre, that whan any two gentilmen happen to fall out, either they dooe so dissemble it, that theyr malice neuer appeareth to the worlde, or els they agree within theim selfes. For if it come to the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorias</hi> knowlage, it can not be chosen, but he that is most faultie receiueth a great rebuke, and many tymes in those cases diuers are banished, or sharpely punished. As for theyr other lawes, though I were sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in theim, yet partly for briefenesse, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thei are not so muche necessarie to my purpose, I passe theim ouer. But this is cleere, there can be no better ordre of Iustice in a common wealth than theirs, if it were duely obserued. How be it corrupcion (by the aduocates meanes) is so crept in amongest the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that poore men many times can want no delaies in the processe of theyr mattiers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Finde two sortes of warre, one by sea, an other by lande.</p>
               <p>¶By sea the Uenetians theim selfes gouerne the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18978:91"/>
whole, and by lande they are serued of straungers, both for generall, for capitaines, and for all other men of warre: because theyr lawe permitteth not any Ueneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to be capitaine ouer an armie by lande. (Fearyng I thynke Caesars example) Neuerthelesse with theyr ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie by lande, they sende foorthe dyuers of theyr gentil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, some as legates, some as paiemaisters. So that theyr generall, (what noble man so euer he be) hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a counsaile of the Uenetians about him: by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in maner all thynges are dooen.</p>
               <p>¶And by sea euery Galey hath one gentilman Ueneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an for capitaine, by the name of <hi>Sopracomito</hi>: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a noumbre of galeys one <hi>Legate</hi> (as it were an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myrall) that maie hange and punisshe at his pleasure. This is ordinarie both in peace and warre. For though the peace be neuer so sure and quiet, yet faile thei not to send forth yerely certaine armed galeis to kepe the seas against <hi>Corsales,</hi> and <hi>Pyrates</hi>: not onely because their merchaundise maie passe saufely to and fro, but also for the honour that they claime in the dominion therof. For yerely on the ascension daie, the Duke, with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, in theyr best araie vse to goe into the hauen at <hi>Lio,</hi> and there by throwyng a rynge into the water, to take the sea as theyr espouse.</p>
               <p>¶Finally whan they happe to haue any daungerouse warre by sea or lande, they create a <hi>Proueditore,</hi> who (out of Uenice) is of no lesse authoritee, than the <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi> was wont to be in Rome: specially by sea.

               <p>¶They haue also certaine schooles or felowships ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together for deuocion, as one of sainct Marke, an other of sainct Rooke, one of this sainct, an other of that: which (beyng for the most part substanciall men) dooe releeue a noumbre of the poore after this sorte.</p>

               <head>Of customes in their lyuyng.</head>
               <p>TO speake of the gentilman Uenetians priuate life and customes, I wote not whether it be best to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the common reporte: or to dissemble the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier. And yet me seemeth I can not dooe more indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
<pb facs="tcp:18978:93"/>
than recite what is vsed to be said on both sidꝭ.</p>
               <p>¶If any man woulde saie, there were no woorthy men amongest the Uenetians, he shoulde greatly erre. For (as I beleue) there be some, and specially of those olde fatherly men, as wyse, as honest, as faiethfull, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and as vertuous, as in any place can be found. Lykewise some of the younge men, as gentill, as libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as valiaunt, as well learned, as full of good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litees, as maie be. But to speake of the greatter num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre, straungers vse to reporte, that the gentilman Uene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian is proude, disdeinfull, couetouse, a great nygarde, a more leachour, spare of liuyng, tyranne to his tenant, finally neuer satisfied with hourdyng vp of money. For though (saie they) he haue .viii.ix. or .x. thousand duckates of yeerely reuenew, yet woull he kepe no moe persones in his house, but his wife and children, with ii. or .iii. women seruauntes, and one man, or two at the most, to row his <hi>Gondola.</hi> He woull goe to the market hym selfe, and spende so miserablie, that many a meane man shall fare better than he. Of his .10000. duckates a yere, if he spend three or .iiii.C. in his house, he estemeth it a wonderfull charge. Besides all this, he hath .ii. or .iii. Iewes, that choppe and chaunge with him daiely: by whose vsurie he gaineth out of measure. And yet woull be rather see a poore man statue, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue hym with a penie. It is true, he woul haue his wife goe gaie and sumptuously apparailed, and on his woman besides, if he be a louer (as in maner thei be all) he woull sticke for no coste. To the mariage of his daughter .30.40. or .50. thousande duckates is no meruaile. Finally his greatest triumphe is, whan
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18978:93"/>
saincte Marke hath neede (for vnder that name is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended theyr common welth) to be hable to disburse an huge summe of money in lone, to receiue yerely till he be repaied .10.12. or .15. of the .hundreth.</p>
               <p>¶This kynde of prest the <hi>Signoria</hi> vseth to take (bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowyng of all them that are hable to lende) whan thei happen to haue warres. And they that maie, doe the more willyngly lende: because they are not onely well paied againe with the vsurie, but also the more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fauoured as long as theyr money is out of their handes.</p>
               <p>¶This is theyr trade, saieth the straunger. But the Uenetian to the contrary defendeth hym selfe on this wyse.</p>
               <p>¶Admitte (saieth he) that this report were true, If I be proude, I haue good cause, for I am a prince and no subiecte. If I be spare of liuyng, it is because my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth alloweth no pompe, and measure is hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. If I kepe few seruantes, it is because I nede no moe. If I bie my meate my selfe, it is because, I woul eate that, that I loue, &amp; that (hauing little a do) I woul exercise my selfe withall. As for my tenaunt, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by me, and I am no tyranne for husbandyng myne owne. If I gaine, I gaine vpon my money, and hide not my talent in the grounde. If I loue, I hate not: if she be fayre, I am the more woorthie. If I spende little, I haue the more in my purse. If I spend large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with my daughter, it is because I woull bestow hir on a gentilman Uenetian, to encrease the nobilitee of myne owne bloudde, and by meane of suche aliaunce to atteine more habilitee to rule and reigne in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:18978:94"/>
wealth: Besydes that, my money: if hir hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande die, is hirs and no mans els. If my wyfe goe gaie, it is to please myne eie, and to satisfie hir. In kepyng my money to lende vnto sainct Marke, it is both an helpe to my common wealth, and a profite vnto my selfe.</p>
               <p>¶And thus defendeth the Uenetian it, that in maner all the worlde laieth vnto his charge.</p>
               <p>¶But surely many of theim trade and bringe vp theyr children in so muche libertee, that one is no sooner out of the shell, but he is hayle felow with father and friend, and by that time he cometh to .xx. yeres of age, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as muche lewdnesse as is possible to be imagined. For his greatest exercise is to goe amongest his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to this good womans house and that. Of whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in Uenice are many thousandes of ordinarie, lesse than honest. And no meruaile of the multitude of theyr common women, for among the gentilmen is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine vse, that if there be diuers brethern, lightly but one of theim dooeth marie: because the numbre of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilmen shoulde not so encrease, that at length their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth myght waxe vile: wherfore the rest of the brethern dooe kepe Courtisanes, to the entent they maie haue no laufull children. And the bastardes that they begette become most commonly monkes, friers, or nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: who by theyr friendes meanes are preferred to the offices of most profite, as abbottꝭ, priours, and so foorth. But specially those Courtisanes are so riche, that in a maske, or at the feast of a mariage, or in the shrouyng tyme: you shall see theim decked with iewelles, as thei were Queenes. So that it is thought no one citee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18978:94"/>
hable to compare with Uenice, for the numbre of gorgeouse dames.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I saie, that the Padoanes (moste of auctoritee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the rest) after this fyrste buildyng of the citee, ordeined certaine consules for the gouernyng thereof: who for a few yeres, now one, now other ruled the same: vntill the citee beganne to waxe great and populous: and that (because the situacion of the places in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, woulde not suffre the citee to be one whole thyng to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but diuided into diuers ilandes, as the water did geue) they were faine to appoincte yerely ouer euery i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande one Tribune to gouerne theim: and for mattiers concernyng the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, thei ordeined a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall counsaile, wherunto all the Tribunes, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine of the chosen citesins, should repayre.

But principally the diligence of theyr fisshers yelded
<pb facs="tcp:18978:96"/>
theim no small gayne, by reason that theyr saltfishe, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into other places, was bought as a speciall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundise. So that in processe of tyme theyr repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion, wealth and force began so muche to grow: that in the defence of Italie, and fauour of the emperour Iustinian (whose capitaine Bellisario had besieged the Gottishe kyng Uitige in Rauenna) they made out cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ships and botes, and vpon the riuer of <hi>Pò,</hi> mette with parte of the Gottisshe armie, fought with theim, and discomfited them. Againe, in company of <hi>Valeria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> gouernour of Rauenna, thei were part of those .40. ships, that discomfited other .40. saile of the kyng Toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la before Aucona: taking and drowning the most part of them. For the whiche doynges they were both embraced of themperour, &amp; also much honored of his capitains: in so muche that the famous Narses, being sent of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to defend Italy against the foresaid Gotes, what to thanke the Uenetians, and to see the maner of theyr citee, went in person vnto Uenice, where he commended muche the diligence of theyr goodly buildyng: and in that meane while sent his armie by lande to Rauenna: in whiche iourney at the passage of the <hi>Pò,</hi> the Uene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian shippes did hym great seruice.</p>
            <p>¶Thus whyle Narses was in the <hi>Rialto</hi> of Uenice, the Padoanes sent ambassadours vnto hym, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, how the Uenetians had vsurped vpon theim those ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>¶And so vnder the fauour of diuers emperours those ilandes of Uenice, as <hi>Grado, Eraclea, Equilo,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamoco</hi> were gouerned of priuate Tribunes, &amp; by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall counsaile for the space of .200. yeres and more, without any great incident, woorthie to be mencioned: excepte that betwene the bishoppes (afterwarde made Patriarkes) of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> whiche standeth in the maine lande: and of <hi>Grado,</hi> that lieth in the marisshes, there was muche warre, strife, and feyghtyng for the interest of theyr iurisdictions.</p>
            <p>¶Finally in the tyme of Constantine the .iiii. after I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie through diuers warres had been sore afflicted, and that from all partes the persones that were of power (for theyr sauegarde) fledde thither: Uenice encreased so muche, that <hi>Luipandro,</hi> Duke of <hi>Friuli,</hi> either for enui, or for feare of their towardnesse, prouoked cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine of his neighbours to oppresse Uenice. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly on a night made out a certeine noumbre of botes downe the water, and sodeinely assaulted <hi>Grado, Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea,</hi> and <hi>Rialto</hi>: where they toke certeine shippes, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with merchaundise, lately comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:18978:97"/>
people continued, and specially the lamentacion of them that had lost theyr friendes or goodes. Wherfore in <hi>Eraclea</hi> they called a counsaile, and muche adooe there was through diuersitee of opinions: because the people laied all the fault in the ill gouernaunce of the officers. But at last the Patriarke of <hi>Grado,</hi> an ancient learned man, of auctoritee, was praied to saie his minde. Who with a longe oracion persuaded, that without concorde it was impossible to liue surely or quiet, and that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as were dyuers heades, there coulde be no concorde. Wherfore his opinion was, that they should chose them one onely prince, to gouerne theyr common wealth, and preserue theyr vnitee. For where any astate (saied he) is not gouerned with one consent and will, there nother haboundaunce of money, strength of place, noumbre of people, woorthinesse of capitaines, nor helpe of friendꝭ or neighbours can auaile. So the whole counsaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeyng to his opinion, resolued vpon the election of a Duke: that shoulde haue auctoritee and charge ouer all mattiers of importaunce, to call the counsaile, and to haue priuate thynges referred vnto hym by the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: that the counsaile of the clergie shoulde not assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but by licence of the Duke: and that the benefices geuen by the people and clergie, should be confyrmed by hym.</p>
            <p>¶To whiche dignitee they fyrst elected a woorthy cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin <hi>Paolo Lucio</hi> of <hi>Eraclea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Paolo. Lucio.</note> geuyng hym an othe for the administracion of iustice, and for the quiete rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer theim without tyrannie.</p>
            <p>¶Thus whan <hi>Paolo</hi> had taken the gouernaunce into his handes, he beganne to agree those persons, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18978:97"/>
contended: whiche was so muche the more easie to dooe, by as muche as at that time there was almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall warres betwene the Lumbardes, and some of the Dukes, either of <hi>Friuli, Spóleti,</hi> or <hi>Beneuento</hi>: that in maner all theyr neighbours were in armes.</p>
            <p>¶Whan he had thus well quieted his citesins, he ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned watche and warde to be kept at the mouthes of the riuers: fortifiyng some of theim with castles, as tyme and place would serue hym.</p>
            <p>¶He commaunded euery towne to haue a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of botes in a readinesse, whan the Duke shoulde geue theim any token: and restored the Uenetian dominion vnto his olde lymites, now called <hi>La piaue Secca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶He maynteined amitee with the kynge <hi>Ariperto,</hi> and made peace with <hi>Luipandro,</hi> with condicions of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vauntage. But amongeste all his other doynges the worthiest of memory, was, that he refourmed the lawes,<note place="margin">Lawes.</note> and broughte theim into suche a playne and briefe order, that eche man mighte be his owne lawyer: Affirmyng, that nothyng can more hynder a man, than the folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of longe suites and greedy lawyers. Wherfore in those daies they vsed none imperiall lawes: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those theyr fewe lawes written, if there happened any doubte, incontinentely they resorted vnto the lawe of nature, chosyng that, whiche semed vnto theim moste iust and honest.</p>
            <p>¶After <hi>Paolo,</hi> an other citesin of <hi>Eraclea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Marcello.</note> named <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cello,</hi> a very sobre and wise man, was elected Duke, but in diligence he was nothyng comparable vnto <hi>Paolo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶In the tyme of this Marcello (except the stryfe and contencion betwene the patriarkꝭ of <hi>Aquileia</hi> and <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>

            <p>¶He firste vsed to bryng vp the youthe of Uenice in the exercise of armes. He augmented the numbre of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours in the shippes of warre, and thorough his valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntnesse restored Paolo, one of the Grekish emperours capitaines, vnto the astate of Rauenna. In whiche enterprise <hi>Perendio,</hi> Duke of <hi>Vicenza</hi> was slayne, and <hi>Ildepandro,</hi> nephew of Luipandro taken prysoner: who by commission of the same Luipandro, had (by syege) gotten the saied citee from the foresaied Paolo.</p>
            <p>¶This victorie was one notable thyng that firste exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Uenetian name.</p>

            <p>¶After this they recouered <hi>Zara</hi> also, and semblablie rased the walles therof to the earthe, in so muche that many of the inhabitantes (beyng fled before) with the helpe of the Hungariens, renewed an armie, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron all <hi>Dalmatia.</hi> But at lengthe they were constreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make peace with the Uenetians, geuyng theyr children in ostaige, submittyng theyr churche vnto the Patriarke of <hi>Grado,</hi> and bindyng theim selfes to geue yerelie three thousande conie skinnes to the Duke for a present.</p>

                  </gap> Gradeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go .1290.</note>¶After <hi>Dandolo, Peter Gradenigo</hi> was elected Duke. At whose entryng the truce with the Genowaies expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: so that a new armie, vnder the leadyng of <hi>Roger Morosini proueditore,</hi> was sent into the east partes: Where thei toke <hi>Pera,</hi> and <hi>Castello delle foglie vecchie</hi>: and abode there so longe, that the yere folowyng <hi>Iohn Zoranzo,</hi> with .25. fresshe galleis, was sent thither:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18978:110"/>
who toke the citee of <hi>Cafa</hi> in <hi>Chersonesso.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶The Genowaies this meane while prepared an army of .70. galeys, and vnder their capitaine <hi>Lampado d' oria,</hi> entred into the Adriatike seas, entendyng to come to Uenice. But the Uenetian armie (beyng the greatest that euer they made) caused them to retyre: yet metyng together vpon the coste of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> they foughte, and the Uenetians were discomfited, and <hi>Andrea Dandolo Proueditore</hi> taken prisoner, who so muche despaired, that beatyng his head against the galey bordes, he slewe him selfe. And albeit that the losse of this armie was of great importaunce and peryll vnto the Uenetians, yet incontinently they renforced theyr power, and in the streict of <hi>Gallipoli,</hi> sometime called <hi>Hellespontus,</hi> mette with the Genowaies againe, and were there again ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comen. But the Genowaies for all their victories were so weried, that they graunted the Uenetians peace, and laied warre aside for a season.</p>
            <p>¶Thus the thynges ferre of, beyng appeased, their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse at home beganne to awake. For one <hi>Marino Bocconio</hi> conspired against the Duke and Senate, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che beyng discouered, he and dyuers of his complices, were put to death betweene the pillers of. S. Marke.</p>
            <p>¶The Padoanes began than also to fortifie at a certain place, betwene <hi>Chiozza,</hi> and <hi>Albano,</hi> called <hi>Petabubula,</hi> whiche was no littell trouble vnto the Uenetians, for the tyme, howe beit at length they remedied it.</p>
            <p>¶After this they made out an other armie by sea vnder <hi>Belletto Iustiniano,</hi> who prospered muche in Greece. For after he had ouerronne all those costes, he returned home with .15000. prisoners, and with a great summe of
<pb facs="tcp:18978:111"/>
money recouered of the Greekish emperour, that before tyme the Uenetians had lente him. Whiche was no small coumforte to the common wealth that longe time had suffered.</p>
            <p>¶Shortely after Clement bishop of Rome excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Uenetians, for aydyng of <hi>Azo da Este</hi> vnto the astate of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and wrote his letters thoroughout all Europe, condemnyng theim as enemies of the churche, and geuyng their gooddes as a laufull praie vnto all men, whiche caused theim to susteine great losse.</p>
            <p>¶Besides this, <hi>Baiamonte Tiepolo,</hi> their owne citesin, entendyng to make him selfe lorde of Uenice, enterprised to assaulte the Duke and Senate in the palaice, where after muche bloud shed, at laste he was slayne, and his parttakers accordynglie punysshed, parte in Uenice, and part at a place there besides, called <hi>Malpasso.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶<hi>Zara</hi> about this tyme rebelled againe, and shortelie after this Duke died.</p>

            <p>¶Than folowed <hi>Iohn Soranzo,</hi> who recouered <hi>Zara,</hi> and brought <hi>Noua,</hi>

            <p>¶This meane tyme <hi>Fraunces Dandalo,</hi> ambassadour with bishop Clemente, vsed suche humilitee, that Uenice was not onely assoiled, but also priuileged to be no more on that wise accursed.</p>
            <p>¶These thynges finished, they sente out .50. galleys against the Genowaies, because they had taken the Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians goodes. But after thei had besieged <hi>Pera,</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:18978:111"/>
and were promised amendes and restitucion of theyr goodes, the armie retourned without other expedicion.</p>
            <p>¶Than was <hi>Iustiniano,</hi> that had been capitaine therof, sent <hi>Proueditore</hi> into <hi>Candia,</hi> where with his wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he quieted the countrey, that beganne to rebell.</p>
            <p>¶Finally, after the Uenetians had preserued the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doanes from the furie of <hi>Mastino della Scala,</hi> that wold haue oppressed theim, this Duke <hi>Soranzo</hi> died.</p>

            </p>
            <p>¶He caused <hi>Thomas Viaro Proueditore</hi> of the armie against the Genowaies, to die in prison: because he had not borne hym selfe prudently in that enterprise.</p>
            <p>¶He sent <hi>Peter Zeno</hi> with an armie against the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that than had newly chased the Christians out of <hi>Soria.</hi> Whiche Turkes were foughten with, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally discoumfited.</p>
            <p>¶Than beganne the warres against the <hi>Signori della Scala,</hi> the chiefe wherof was <hi>Mastino</hi> before named: who chasyng the <hi>Rossi</hi> from <hi>Parma,</hi> gotte <hi>Feltro, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luno,</hi> and <hi>Ceneda,</hi> before tyme taken by the saied <hi>Rossi</hi> from kyng Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Boeme.</hi> This Mastino thus growyng great, attempted to trouble the Uenetians with buildyng of fortresses and bastilions about <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bubula.</hi> Wherfore the Uenetians entred in league with the kynge of Boeme, and with the most parte of all the

               <note place="margin">Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meo Gradeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go .1340.</note>¶Than Bartholomeo Grandenigo, succeded, in whose tyme, the water in Uenice for the space of three daies, did swell foure yardes higher than his wonted course: so that they thought to haue been all drowned: but at laste sainct Nicolas, sainct George, and sainct Marke came into a poore fisshers bote, and in the mouthe of the hauen drowned a shippe of diuels that wrought all this mischiefe. For proufe wherof, this poore fissher the next mornyng after the water ceased, presented vnto the Duke and senate a golde rynge that sainct Marke had geuen hym. This was taken there for a myracle, though I thinke no man woulde beleeue it.</p>
            <p>¶The feare of this water was no sooner ceased, but newes came, that the Candians rebelled. Wherfore a power sent thither, assaulted theim on three sydes, and with the correction of the principall rebelles, reduced
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18978:112"/>
theim to their former obedience.</p>
            <p>¶Shortely after happened a great dearth of corne, and <hi>Gradenigo</hi> died.</p>
            <p>¶Than folowed <hi>Andrea Dandolo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Andrea Dandolo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1343.</note> a man for his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ciuilitee muche commended of <hi>Petrarcha.</hi> In whose time <hi>Peter Zeno</hi> (in company of other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian princes) was sent with an armie againste the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, whom at the firste they discomfited, and toke Smir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: but afterwardes the Turkes assembled againe, and with great slaughter ouercame the Uenetians, the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priotes, and the Rodianes.</p>
            <p>¶This Duke procured licence of the kynge of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that Uenetian merchauntes might freely traffic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que in Aegypt, and sent an army vnto <hi>Zara</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than yelded vnto the kynge of Hungarie, who beyng come thither with .120000. men, was fought with by the Uenetians discomfited, and <hi>Zara</hi> recouered.</p>
            <p>¶This duke ordeined the office of the three <hi>Auditours,</hi> for the better expedicion of matters, because the <hi>Auo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadori</hi> had to muche charge on theim to dispatche well: and he him selfe wrote a worthie historie of the Ueneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an astate and lawes for the tyme than passed.</p>
            <p>¶He sente .vi. shippes into Sicilia for corne, wherof two peerished by the waie, the other .iiii. releeued the citee in their great dearth. After folowed such an earthquake, that .iii. or .iiii. steples, with diuers other buildynges in Uenice were shaken to the earth: and than suche a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that in maner Uenice became voyde. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse a newe armie was made out against the Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, that fought with theim at <hi>Caristo</hi> besides <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groponte,</hi> where firste the Genowaies were discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:18978:113"/>
than the Uenetians, and thirdelie in <hi>Sardegna</hi> the Genowaies againe: and therby brought so lowe, that they became subiectes to <hi>Iohn Visconti,</hi> archebishop and Duke of Myllaine, who sente the famouse <hi>Petrarcha</hi> ambassadour to Uenice, to obteine peace for him and the Genowaies. But the Uenetians wolde not graunte it. Wherfore the <hi>Visconti</hi> sente his armie into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> sacked the townes of <hi>Faro</hi> and <hi>Corfu,</hi> toke <hi>Parenzo</hi> in <hi>Istria,</hi> and spoiled a Uenetian shippe, goyng into Candia, of value (by reporte) of .800000. duckates.</p>
            <p>¶Thus while the Uenetians for ease of this trouble were makyng a leage with the kyng of Boeme, to bryng him against the Uisconti, this Duke <hi>Dandolo</hi> died.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Marino. Falerio .1354.</note>¶<hi>Marino Falerio</hi> succeded him, in whose daies the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth lacked littell of vtter vndoyng.

            <p>¶Finallie this <hi>Beltrame</hi> for his rewarde, was made a gentilman of Uenice, with a thousand ducates of yerely reuenew. But after a certaine space, thinkyng his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ouer littell in respecte of so great a seruice, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented him selfe vnto the senate, and was so importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that they not onelie toke from him his foresaied reuenew, but also depriued hym of the gentilmans dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitee,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18978:113"/>
and made hym a skinner againe, as he was before.</p>
            <p>¶After this <hi>Marco Cornaro</hi> as <hi>Vice Doge,</hi> ruled for a certeine space.</p>
            <p>¶Than <hi>Iohn Gradenico</hi> was elected Duke,<note place="margin">Iohn Gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>denico .1355.</note> who sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng out .vii. galleis against the Genowaies, was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the peace, that immediately folowed betwene theim.</p>
            <p>¶In his time Lewis kyng of Hungarie entred in leage with certeine princes and nobles of Lumbardie against the Uenetians: so that after he had been before <hi>Zara, Spalato, Trau,</hi> and <hi>Nona,</hi> with other places in <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>: he besieged <hi>Treuiso</hi>: duryng whiche siege <hi>Grade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico</hi> died.</p>
            <p>¶Than <hi>Iohn Delfino</hi> was chosen,<note place="margin">Iohn Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fino .1356.</note> who being that time besieged within Treuiso, and aduertised of his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, requyred the kynges saueconducte to passe: whiche woulde not be graunted. Wherfore at last in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of certeine men of armes, he secretly departed, and came to Uenice: and was no sooner in the auctoritee, but he reuoked the <hi>Potestate</hi> of <hi>Padoa,</hi> and toke from the Padoanes the trade of salte. A mattier vnto them of great importance. This did he to be reuenged on <hi>Carraro,</hi> a principall of the Padoanes, who was entred into intelligence with the Hungariens.</p>
            <p>¶Finally this king prospered so muche against the Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, that thei were constreigned for a peace to grant hym all <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> from the goolfe <hi>Fanatico,</hi> to <hi>Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo,</hi> with certeine other townes about <hi>Ceneda</hi> and <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiso,</hi> that he had than newly gotten.</p>

            <p>¶Finally the Candiottes were so oppressed, that they were constreigned to aske peace, and with sharpe puny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shementes were broughte to their wonted obedience.</p>

            <p>¶Than beganne a new bickeryng betwene the <hi>Carrari,</hi> lordes of Padoa, and the Uenetians, for the interest of certeine confines, betwene whom were many skirmishes with variable fortune on both sides. But the Uene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians had euer the better, vntill the <hi>Carrari</hi> had gotten in leage the kynge of Hungarie, the Duke of Austria, the Genowaies, and the Patriarke of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> who on all sides by lande and sea, oppressed the Uenetians sore. For notwithstandyng that in this meane while, with helpe of the kyng of Cyprus on the one side, they fyrste discomfited <hi>Andronico</hi> sonne of the emperour <hi>Caloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anni</hi> with the Greekes in the Ile of <hi>Tenedo,</hi> and after that diuers of the Genowaies by sea.

               <note place="margin">Fertilitee of Naples</note>¶Some thinke the fertilitee of the realme shoulde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede muche of the heate that this sulfure geueth the ground (seyng there is more plenty than elswhere) but whereof so euer it cometh the countrey is surely reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of all thynges necessary for mans life, and so ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt withall, that <hi>Pandolfo Collenuccio</hi> (a notable writer of the Neapolitane histories) thinketh, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull mutacious that haue happened in the same, to procede of the desire that men had vnto the pleasers and commoditees of the countrey. And further speakyng of the inconstancie of the people, he saieth these woordes: It seemeth, that the realme of Naples is predestinate to haue in it continuall tyrannies, sedicions, falshead, rebellions, warres, destruction of citees, rauishementes, and flambe, with all the other calamitees that of aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18978:125"/>
and ambicion (true mothers of suche plages) maie grow. And allegeyng the auctoritee of diuers aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente writers, affirmeth, that the prouinces of the realme, whiche he calleth <hi>Regnicoli,</hi> doe perseuer without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion as longe as thei finde none to rebell against. Neuerthelesse <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> and the auncient Romaine histories shewe, that Naples it selfe was of all other citees moste constante in their faieth towardes the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, aswell in tyme of daunger as of prosperitee.

And you shall yet to this houre see, that the Neapolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are scarcely trusted on their wordes. Not that I thynke thei deserue lesse credite than other men, but because the wonted generall ill opinion of their vnsted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse, is not taken out of mens hertes. Yet is the Neapolitane for his good enterteimente reckened to be the varaie courtesie of the worlde, thoughe moste men repute him to be a great flatterer and full of crafte. What woll you more? Thei are riche, for almost euery gentilman is lorde and kynge within hym selfe, they haue veray fayre women, and the worlde at will, in so muche as Naples contendeth with Uenice, whether shoulde be preferred for sumptuouse dames. Finally the court about the <hi>Vicere,</hi> was wont to be very prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

            <p>¶After the deth of Drogone,<note place="margin">Hunfredo.</note> folowed his brother Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredo, who continued .vii. yeres in the astate without any notable thyng that happened in his tyme.</p>
            <p>¶Than succeded Godfrey an other brother,<note place="margin">Godfrey.</note> in whose tyme the prince of Salern happened to be slayne of his owne men, and <hi>Gisulfo</hi> a Normaine made prince in his place. This <hi>Gisulfo</hi> had diuers tymes attempted the gettyng of Beneuento, and now of newe made prepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion for the same, wherfore Leo the .ix. than bishop of Rome, required succours of Henry the .ii. emperour of Almaine than beyng in Rome.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Robert Guiscardo</note>¶This Robert was a man strong, hardy, and wise, who perceiuyng the great contencion betwene the Romaines and Nicolas the secounde their bishop (the better to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisshe his dominion) he sente his ambassadours to the bishop, who in company of those ambassadours came to the citee Aquila, and there mette with Robert: and had suche communicacion to gethers, that Robert was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to restore to the bishop, the citees of Beneuento and Troia, with those other landes, that he before had taken from the churche,<note place="margin">Roberte created Duke.</note> for the whiche the bishop crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him laufull Duke of Puglia and Calabria, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uested him in the same duchy, with gifte of the standarde of the churche, so that Robert became liege man and vassaile of the Romain see, and by the bishops commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement broughte his armie to Rome, where he so chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Romaines, that they gladlie obeied theyr holie Romaine father.</p>
            <p>¶Not longe after, leauyng his brother Guglielmo in Puglia, he passed into Calabria, and fortified the towne of S.

consented wholy to call him from thensfoorth Duke of Calabria and Puglia.</p>

And wonder it was to see the speede of these victories, for Robert Guiscardo and his brethren, had brought all these dominions before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersed vnder theim within the space of .xviii. yeres.</p>
            <p>¶Not longe after, Gregorie the .vii. bishop of Rome, fyrste fell out with Robert, but afterwarde beeyng sore persecuted by Henrie the .iii. emperour of Almaine, he agreed with Roberte, and receiuyng of hym onely the marke of Ancona, he confyrmed to him all that Nicolas the .ii. had before graunted with rather more.

            <p>¶Thus Robert, after many woorthie feates dooen in Italie and Sicile, by occasion at last minded to driue A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessio, emperour of Constantinople out of his astate, and to be emperour hym selfe, so that he passed the sea with an huge armie, conquered <hi>Durazo, Valona,</hi> and dyuerse other citees in <hi>Dalmatia, Albania</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>: fought by sea with the Greekishe and Uenetian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies bothe, and ouercame theim: and was lyke to haue preuailed in his enterprise, had not death preuented him.</p>

            <p>¶But see what folowed.

Wherof yet vnto this daie, the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18978:137"/>
Sicilians euensonge, is vsed as a prouerbe in Italie.</p>
            <p>¶And than by accorde came the kynge of Aragone and receiued Sicile vnto his dominion,<note place="margin">Peter kynge of Aragone.</note> the rather because he had a certaine title thervnto, as in the right of his wyfe Constance, daughter to the late kyng Manfredo.

            <p>¶And for as muche as some holde opinion, that this Charles was the fyrst Neapolitane kyng,<note place="margin">Title of the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Ierusalem 1276.</note> that obteined the title of kynge of Ierusalem, it is necessarie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, by what meane.</p>
            <p>¶The ladie Marie, doughter of the prince of Antioche,
<pb facs="tcp:18978:138"/>
resigned into the handes of this kynge Charles all hir tytle to the realme of Ierusalem, whervpon be caused him selfe to be crowned kynge of Ierusalem, and with helpe of the Uenetians, sente Roger <hi>Di San Seuerino</hi> to be gouernour, to receiue feaultee and homage of the christen barons there. Thus and not by the interest of Federike, the kynges of Naples vsed the title of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem: though I fynde not who was Maries father, by name, nor yet by what reason that realme shoulde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine to hir.</p>
            <p>¶Whan kynge Charles was deade, his onely soonne and heire,<note place="margin">Carlo 2.</note> Charles prince of Salerne remained prisoner in Sicile, vnder the kepyng of quene Constance, wife to kyng Peter of Aragone: and was by consente of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons condemned to die, as it were for a full reuengement of Corradinos death: but the noble hert of Constance, woulde not suffre it: Excusyng the mattier, that before she knew hir housbandes mynde, she would not attempt so great a thyng. Wherefore she sent hym into Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,<note place="margin">Prince Edwarde of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande.</note> where he continued prisoner till kyng Peter died: and than by procurement of prince Edwarde, lorde of Gascoygne, he was deliuered and restored to his realme of Naples.

            <p>¶Here is to be noted, that within the space of one yere died .iii. kynges and a bishop of Rome, that is to we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>¶After Peter succeded in the realme of Aragon his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sonne Aufus, in Sicile his sonne Iames, that helde

in prison the forenamed Charles the secounde.</p>
            <p>¶Finallie Aufus the elder brother beyng dead, Iames, to haue the kyngdome of Aragon in peace (sore vexed at that time by the Frenche kyng) fell at composicion with Charles, to renounce Sicile vnto hym, and so did. But Federike yonger brother to Iames,<note place="margin">Federike kyng of Sicile.</note> assoone as he heard therof, gotte a certain power, went into Sicile, and gatte it to hym selfe: by reason wherof betwene Charles and Federike was continuall warre manie yeres, till at last Charles to haue Calabria in peace (the most parte wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Federike had gotten by force) consented, that Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike duryng his life, shoulde quetlie enioy Sicile.</p>
            <p>¶So Charles bringing all his thinges to a quiet,<note place="margin">1309.</note> reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned .24. yeres, and died, leauyng issue by his wife (Mary doughter of kyng Stephen of Hungarie) ix. sonnes and v. doughters. The eldeste named Charles Martell, afterwardes kynge of Hungarie by the mothers title, Lewis the secounde sonne bishop of Tolouse in Spaine, Robert the thirde sonne kynge of Naples. As for the reste, though they were princes, Quenes and princesses, yet I passe theim ouer, and will onely speake of Lewys Duke of <hi>Durazzo,</hi> because Charles <hi>Da Durazzo</hi> (who was next kyng after the firste quene Iohan) descended of him.</p>
            <p>¶At the death of Charles,<note place="margin">Robert.</note> Robert his .iii. sonne beyng in Auignion, was called from thens to the dominion of Naples, and confirmed kyng by Clemente the .v. than bishop of Rome, howebeit not longe after Caronumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to kynge of Hungarie, and sonne of his elder brother Charles, pretended title thervnto: but after longe deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng therof, the lawiers finallie determined, that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert

shoulde continue, and Caronumberto shoulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente hym with the realme of Hungarie. And though Robert was muche troubled by the comyng of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Henry the .vii. into Italie, yet (after the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was poisoned by a blacke frier, in ministryng hym the sacrament of communion at Bonconuento besides Siena, by order (as thei saie) of the Romish legate, king Robert prospered so well in Italie (by reason he was taken as heade of the Guelfi) that he subdued Genoa: and the Florentines with their whole astate submitted them selfes vnto him, and accepted his sonne <hi>Carlo sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za terra</hi> to be their lorde. Whiche Charles not longe after his establishment in that dominion, retourned to Naples and died.</p>
            <p>¶Finally Robert hym selfe sickened and died, without heyres males.<note place="margin">1342.</note> And so the inheritance remained in the iii. daughters of his forenamed sonne Charles. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eldest named Iohan, he by his testament lefte the realme, vpon condicion, that she shoulde marie with his nephew Andrew, younger son of the abouenamed Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numberto.

            <p>¶Accordyng to the testament of kyng Robert, his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiew Andrew came out of Hungarie,<note place="margin">Giouanna prima. Quene Iohans.

            <p>¶Than maried she Lewys prince of <hi>Taranto,</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

beautifull man. But Lewys kyng of Hungarie, elder brother to Andrew, to reuenge his brothers deathe, came with a puissaunt armie into the realme, insomuch that the Queene and hir husband bothe fledde to Auig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Prouance, leauyng Charles <hi>da Durazzo,</hi> sonne of Lewys <hi>da Durazzo</hi> beforenamed, theyr lieuetenant to defende: but the Hungarien so muche prospered, that in short space he gatte the whole realme, and toke this Charles <hi>da Durazzo,</hi> with his son Charles prisoners. The father was beheaded, as giltie of the death of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, being of secrete faction in armes with the Quene: the sonne was ledde prisoner into Hungarie. Finally kynge Lewys, after he had been .iii. monethes in the realme, leauyng a stronge garrison of Hungariens at Naples, retourned into his countrey.</p>
            <p>¶Than Clement the .v. bishoppe of Rome entreated a peace betweene kyng Lewys and the Queene, in suche wyse, that Iohan retourned into hir state, with coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt, that hir housband shoulde in no wyse beare the title of kyng.

            <p>¶Finally Lewys conducted an army out of France, and augmentyng it with the Florentine and bishop of Romes powers, entred the realme: where in plaine battaile he so discomfited Ladislaus, that if Lewys had knowen howe to vse his victorie, he mighte haue had Ladislaus in his handes, and also the whole realme: as Ladislaus,

And though fortune for a tyme was fauourable to Duke Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wys, yet at length through practise and lacke of money, Sforza became the Queenes man: so that Lewys was fayne to leaue the enterprise, and drawe to Rome: by reason wherof the Queene with Alfonse remained in peace:<note place="margin">Discorde</note> till discorde fell betweene theim. The fyrst oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion was because the proclamacions were made in the Quenes name, without any mencion of Alfonse: which moued the barons of Aragone to conceiue a great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that a kyng of suche reputacion, shoulde lie there in that astate. So muche grew this mattier, that at last kyng Alfonse toke the Quenes best beloued steward prisoner, and besieged the Queene. How be it, Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za hauyng receiued hir letters, came streight to Naples, fought with Alfonse power, had the better hand, entred into Naples, and conueighed the Queene awaie with hym: Wherfore kyng Alfonse augmented his power, and after harde feight with Sforza, recouered Naples, streignyng the realme so muche, that by counsaile of

Thus ended the successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Charles of Angio first king of that hous.</p>
            <p>¶Whether the Queenes testamente were feygned or true, it was vncerteine: For incontinently vppon hir death, the citee of Naples, ordeined amonge theim a common wealth, and made no mencion of any testament, vntill they saw plainely, that the bishop of Rome went about to bringe theim vnder hym.

that it was doubted, whether of the two partes were the better. Raynolde defied Alfonse bodie to bodie, whiche Alfonse refused not.

            <p>¶Thus Alfonse, obteignyng the quiet possession of the realme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vsed newe meanes of amitee with Eugenio than bishop of Rome: and did so muche, that Eugenio confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him in the astate, and inuested his bastarde sonne Ferdinando successour to the crowne.

            <p>¶Finallie, after a generall leage made in Naples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene all the astates of Italie, excepte the Genowaies, Alfonse made an armie, and besieged Genoa for breache of certaine articles concluded longe before at the making of a peace betwene theim: whiche the Genowaies were bounde to geue to the kynge yerely in maner of a tribute a bason of golde, and the cause of their witholdyng, was for that the kynge woulde neuer receyue it otherwyse than sittyng in his maiestee, as thoughe he triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer theim.</p>

            <p>¶It is manifest, that from the auncient citee of <hi>Fieso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> (the olde rewines wherof are yet to be seen, on the toppe of an hill two myles from Florence) the citee of Florence had hir beginnyng principally.

            <p>¶And albeit, that some haue contended vpon the name, affyrmyng, that it was fyrst called <hi>Fluentia,</hi> and after corrupted <hi>Florentia:</hi> yet myne opinion agreeyng with <hi>Macchiauegli,</hi> is, that from the beginnyng it was called <hi>Florentia.</hi> Under the Romaine empyre, and about the beginnyng of themperours, it semeth to take fyrst name
<pb facs="tcp:18978:152"/>
and reputacion. For whan the empyre beganne to be afflicted of barbarouse nacions (as the Italians calle theim) than was Florence also destroied by Totila king of the east Gotes .250. yeres after it was reedified by Charlemaine,<note place="margin">Florence destroied and reedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> and so continued as one of the principall citees of Italie, vnto the yere of our lorde .1215. alwaies as subiectes, fyrst to the succession of Charlemaine, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Berengarii, &amp; lastly to themperours of Almaine, by whiche tyme the Florentines coulde dooe nothyng woorthy of memorie, for the power of them whose sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes they were: Neuerthelesse in the yere .1010. they toke Fiesole and destroied it vtterly, either by the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours consent, orels betwene the death of the one empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and the election of the other.</p>
            <p>¶But whan the bishoppes of Rome beganne to growe great, and the emperour littell, moste parte of the citees of Italie ganne to gouerne theim selfes with smalle regarde towardes their prince:<note place="margin">1080.</note> so that in the tyme of the emperour Henrie the .iii. all Italie was deuided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene him and the churche.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Guelfi and Ghibelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes faction</note>¶Here is to be noted, that in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tencion betwene the emperour and the bishop of Rome, the whole Italian nacion was so diuided in two partes, that in many hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses you should haue the father against the sonne, brother against brother, and commonlie one neighbour and one house against an other. And to encrese the mischiefe, ii. brethern Dowchemen dwellyng in Pistoia (20. miles from Florence) fell out for this matter, and oftentimes openlie fought in maintenaunce of their diuision. Wherupon it folowed, that all the imperiall named theim selfes Ghibellini, after the name of Ghibell, one of those brethern, and the churche part Guelfi, after the name of Guelfe the other brother. So that the parte of Bondelmonti were Guelfi parte: and they that were with <hi>Vberti</hi> were Ghibellines. Betwene whom not onely the nobilitee of Florence, but also the moste parte of the commons were deuided. Thus by the emperours fauoure the Guelfes were chased out of Florence, and lyued in theyr fortresses and castelles in the vale of Arno, defendyng them selfes as well as they coulde against their ennemies, vntill Federike died: and than by meane of certayne of the citee that were new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, both parties were reconsiled, and the Ghibellines brought home to Florence. Where (laiyng all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion aparte) they framed theim selfes to procure a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertee vnto their citee, ere the newe emperour shoulde haue power to oppresse theim.<note place="margin">Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tines common wealthe constituted</note> And so deuided the citee into .vi. partes, appointyng .xii. citesins (ii. vnto
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18978:153"/>
euerie parte) to gouerne the same, namyng theim <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani</hi>: chaungeable euerie yere. And to eschew occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of variaunce, that might happen betwene the parties for iudgment geuyng, they chose two straunge iudges, one named capitaine of the people, and the other named <hi>Potestate,</hi> to iudge all mattiers bothe ciuile and crymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. And because there is no certaine order, where no defendour is, they ordeyned .20. standardes or ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in the citee: and .76. in the countie, wherein were written all the youthe and able men to be readie in his appoincted kynde of armure whan so euer they shoulde be called, either of the capitaine, or of the <hi>Antiani.</hi> And the better to establishe the thynge, they deuised a carte drawen of two oxen. to carie their baners and ensignes, couered with white: vnto whiche, as to the maiestee of their common wealthe, or as it were to the generall of their armie, the men of warre shoulde alwaies resorte. For whan so euer thei set forth any army into the field, than was this carte or chariote drawen foorthe into the strete called <hi>Mercato Nouo,</hi> and there by the people committed to the charge of the chiefe gouernours of the armie. Besides that they had a bell called <hi>La Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinella,</hi> whiche before the settyng foorthe of anie armie shoulde rynge a monethe, to the intente their ennemies mighte prepare to defende theim selfes. This bell did thei also carie into the fielde with theim, to set their watche, and to call the souldiours together.</p>
            <p>¶Theyr procedynges herein were so commendable and so well handled, that in short space they grew to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull auctoritee, so that Florence became the head of all Tuscane: and had (no doubte of it) atteined suche
<pb facs="tcp:18978:154"/>
reputacion, that it myght haue been well compared to the notable citees of the world, if the new and often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions within theim selfes had not hyndered theyr pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritee.</p>
            <p>¶After this maner they endured .x. yeres, in whiche tyme they enforced the citesins of <hi>Pistoria, Arezzo</hi> and <hi>Siena</hi> to entre in league with theim: and in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne of theyr campe from before <hi>Siena,</hi> thei toke <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terra,</hi> and destroyed certaine other Castelles, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitauntes wherof they caried with theim to Florence. All this was dooen throughe counsaile of the Guelfes, whiche were of greater power in Florence than the Ghi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellines, as well because the Ghibellines through theyr proude and ill gouernaunce had prouoked the hate of the people, whan they ruled in tyme of the emperour Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derike: as also because the commons fauoured more the churche parte than the imperiall, trustyng with the helpe therof to haue theyr libertee mainteined, whiche at the emperours handes they feared to lose.</p>
            <p>¶Wherfore the Ghibellines, seeyng theyr reputacion decaied, disposed them selfes to recouer it, thinking their occasion to be good: whan Manfredi sonne of Federike: had taken the realme of Naples vpon him, and had sore troubled the churches power. Than practised they secretly with hym, to recouer theyr libertee. But their practises were discouered to the <hi>Antiani,</hi> who inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently sent for the <hi>Vberti</hi> to appeare before them: and they not onely disobeied, but also fortified theim selfes in theyr houses, and so prouoked the furie of the people, that at laste the commons arose, and with helpe of the Guelfes chased the Ghibellines out of Florence, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streigned
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18978:154"/>
theim to withdraw to Siena. From whense they sent to kynge Manfredi for succours, and through the diligence of <hi>Maister Farinara delli Vberti</hi> obteined suche ayde, that the Guelfes shortly after were discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited vpon the riuer of <hi>Albia</hi>: with so great a losse, that they whiche escaped, fledde not to Florence (thynkyng it to be lost) but vnto <hi>Lucca.</hi> The generall of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges men in this iourney was one <hi>Conte Iordano,</hi> a man in armes muche renoumed, who folowyng his victorie wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e streight to Florence, and reduced it to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the kynge Manfredi, adnullyng all magistrates and lawes, with euerie other thyng that semed to serue the citees libertee: the iniury wherof bredde double ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice agaynst the Ghibellines in the hertes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and was occasion of theyr vndoyng, as after shall appeare.</p>
            <p>¶The <hi>Conte Iordano</hi> setlyng Florence after his owne facion, was reuoked by the kynge to the seruice of the realme: and therfore appoincted as lieuetenaunt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall there, the <hi>Conte Guido Nouello,</hi> lorde of <hi>Casen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino,</hi> who immediatelie called a counsaile of Ghibelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes at <hi>Empoli,</hi> and there concluded, that (to mainteine theyr parte in Tuscane) it was necessary to destroy Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: but <hi>Maister Farinata Delli Vberti</hi> principall of the Ghibellines, onely amongest all the reste withstode this opinion, allegeyng the perilles that he had suffered were in hope to enioy his countrey, and thinkyng hym selfe no lesse hable to defende it than to gette it, as he had dooen, he professed openly to become no lesse enemy to theim that shoulde take the contrary, than he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to the Guelfes: and so with his onely reason and
<pb facs="tcp:18978:155"/>
auctoritee dissuaded the rest from theyr purpose.</p>
            <p>¶This meane while the Guelfes, whiche were fledde to Lucca, were commaunded thense by the citesins, who feared sore the thretnynges of the Conte: and so went to <hi>Bolognia,</hi> and from thense vnto <hi>Parma</hi> to helpe the Guelfes of Lumbardie against the Ghibellines there. Where after dyuers victories, they grewe to so muche wealth and reputacion, that the bishoppe of Rome toke theim as his, and gaue theim the ensigne of the churche, whiche they vse in Florence to this daie.</p>
            <p>¶Than went the Guelfes with Charles of Angio a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Manfredi, and were partetakers of the victorie, whyche soo muche encreased theyr reputacion that the Conte, with the reste of the Ghibellines, that than ruled Florence, deuised how to gratifie the commons, to gette theyr fauour (whiche before they had vtterly lost) and therfore diuided the citee into artes, appoinctyng officers of the commons vnto euerie arte, so that in all there were .36. citesins called to rule againe, and to make new lawes as before. And where the Conte with the Ghibellines thoughte by these meanes to drawe the peoples fauour towardes theim, the contrarie immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately folowed. For whan the Conte Guido had set a taxe vpon the people, for paiement of his souldiours, they not onely refused the paiement, but also withstode his force and the Ghibellines bothe, in suche wise, that with losse of dyuers men slaine in the bickeryng, the Conte with the Ghibellines (through cowardise of the Conte) forsoke the citee, and went to <hi>Prato</hi>: and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng to retourne, was more easily kepte foorth, than he coulde haue been expelled, in case he had fortified hym
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18978:155"/>
selfe whyle he was within. Thus the people recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red libertee vnto theyr citee, and (in hope to make all thynges well) reuoked aswell the Ghibellines againe as the Guelfes. But all in vaine, for the Ghibellines rested still in the auncient mortall hate of the Guelfes, for dyuers iniuries, and the people loued theim not, as ofte as they remembred theyr passed tyrannie: besydes that the Ghibellines, whan they heard of the puissaunt comyng of <hi>Corradino</hi> out of Almaigne, to winne the realme of Naples, began to deuise how to recouer theyr astate againe. Wherfore the Guelfes sent to the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Charlꝭ than king of Naples for helpe to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfes, whilest <hi>Corradino</hi> shuld passe. And vpon the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of ayde from the kyng, the Ghibellines .ii. daies before fled. And so had the Guelfes libertie to make new lawes and new magistratꝭ, which thei did immediatly. Fyrst deuidyng the Ghibellines goodes in .iii. partes, one to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, an other to the chiefe magistrates, and the .iii. to theim selfes, in recompence of theyr owne hurtes. And the bishop of Rome the better to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine Tuscane Guelfe, made kyng Charles imperiall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care of Tuscane.</p>
            <p>¶After this Gregorie the .x. passyng through Florence towardes Fraunce, deuised with the Guelfes for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siliacion of the Ghibellines, and did so muche, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine men for the Ghibelline parte came into the citee, and after longe communicacion agreed therupon. But because the thing toke no effect, therfore Gregory excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the citee. Whiche Innocent the .v. his next successour assoyled againe.</p>
            <p>¶Thus the Guelfes forgettyng theim selfes in theyr
<pb facs="tcp:18978:156"/>
prosperitee, became so proude, that they regarded ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther magistrate nor people, but for euery lyght occasion woulde feyght, and many tymes kyll without abidyng any iustice: whiche moued the people to murmour, and gaue occasion to the bishop of Romes legate to practise the reuocacion of the Ghibellines vnder pretence of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitee, and brought it to passe in deede: and than was there new orders of magistrates appoincted, and the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesins so vnited, that for verie werinesse of longe striefe bothe abroade and at home, the names of diuision began to decaie, so that Ghibellines and Guelfes were almost forgotten, whan there beganne a new diuision, betwene the nobilitee and the commons, in suche wyse that they armed them selfes, and had tried the mattier with the swoorde, if certaine religiouse and other indifferent men had not taken vp the mattier.</p>
            <p>¶In effecte the pride of the nobilitee was abated, and parte of the commons will bridled, so that they agreed again, and were quiet a while.</p>
            <p>¶There were two notable families in Florence <hi>Cerchi</hi> and <hi>Donati,</hi> betwene whome had ben an olde grudge, but no fightyng of a longe tyme. In Pistoia also two yonge gentilmen <hi>Lore</hi> and <hi>Geri</hi> at plaie fell out and foughte: so that <hi>Lore</hi> hurte <hi>Geri.</hi> The father of <hi>Lore</hi> beyng offended therwith, and thinkyng to pacifie the mattier gentillie, sent his sonne to the father of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> to submitte him selfe and aske forgeuenesse: But the father of <hi>Geri</hi> toke hym and cutte of his hande, saiyng, that woundꝭ were healed with yron, and not with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. This mattier so grew, that the whole citee of <hi>Pistoia</hi> was deuided in two partes, the one callyng them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18978:156"/>
selfes Bianchi, that is to saie, the white, and the other <hi>Neri,</hi> that is to saie the blacke. After longe strife within them selfes being weried, the blacke bande went to Florence, and fell in fauour with the <hi>Donati</hi>: the like wherof did the white bande with the <hi>Cerchi</hi>: so that the aunciente grudge betwene those two families en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and at laste vpon a lighte occasion fell out and foughte in Florence. By reason whereof the whole citee aswell nobles as commons were deuided, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes armed, so that the rulers (as newters) were faine to streigne their power, and partely by force, parte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by auctoritee, causyng the parties to vnarme theim selfes, they banished certaine of the chiefe, speciallie of the <hi>Neri</hi>: whiche beyng exiled, resorted to the bishoppe of Rome: and obteined of hym that Charles of Ualois, brother to the Frenche kynge (than beyng in Rome for certaine practises of the realme of Naples) shoulde be sent to Florence: by whose meane the <hi>Neri</hi> recouered the citee, and by force expulsed the Bianchi. And like as the <hi>Neri</hi> were firste by the bishops meanes restored, so also the Bianchi at the bishops intercession were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued home, but not to rule: whiche greued theim so muche, that vpon newe contencion (their intente beyng discouered) they were vtterly expulsed.</p>
            <p>¶Thus Charles of Ualois (atcheiuyng his purpose in Florence) departed thense, leauyng the <hi>Neri</hi> in quiete possession. But it endured not longe: for <hi>Corso Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i,</hi> chiefe of that parte (thinkyng his astate very small to remeigne as a priuate man, of the common wealthe) moued businesse in the citee, in hope to haue all the rule him selfe. Wherin he preuailed not, for the commons
<pb facs="tcp:18978:157"/>
sente for the Lucchese to succour theym, and by theyr helpe did so ouermatche Corso and his partetakers, that thei remaigned still in their libertee: and procured a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from Rome, to stablishe an order amongeste theim. Who in stede of order (thinkyng to brynge certain pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses to passe) sette theim further out than euer they were, and departyng in great anger exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated the citee.</p>
            <p>¶Thus as the Florentines were daylie at stryfe and warre within them selfes, there chanced so great a fyre, that it burned .1300. of theyr houses: so that what through the wonderfull blouddeshed, and great losse of the fire, for veray werinesse thei laied downe their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and though the legate had craftely gotten .xii. of the chiefe citesins to Rome, in whose absence he so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the Ghibellines and Bianchi (that than were in exile) that folowyng his aduise, they sodeinelie entred the citee. Yet the commons so resisted them, that thei were repulsed. Not longe after perceiuyng the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of <hi>Corso</hi> prepensed against their libertee assaultes his house, put hym to flighte: and in fleyng toke and slewe hym.<note place="margin">1308.</note>
            </p>
            <p>¶After that the Florentines lyued in quiet tyll the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of Henrie the emperour, who comyng from Rome (where he was crowned) besieged Florence on the one side, and at length departed without doyng muche hurt, the rather because the Florentines had receiued suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours from Robert kyng of Naples, to whom they had submitted their citee for .v. yeres.</p>
            <p>¶Not longe after <hi>Vguicione della Faggiola,</hi> with helpe of the Ghibellines, became lorde of <hi>Pisa</hi> and of <hi>Lucca,</hi> so
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18978:157"/>
that the Florentines for dread of hym, requyred kynge Robert of Naples to sende his brother Peter to succour theim. Betwene whom and <hi>Vguicione</hi> was a battaill stricken in <hi>Vale di Nieuole,</hi> where the Florentines were discomfited, loste .2000. men, and the kynges brother slaine in the fielde.</p>
            <p>¶And though the kynge did his beste to succour theim, yet of their naturall inconstancie, thei beganne a newe diuision amonge theim selfes, parte with and parte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the kynge. And for lacke of other the kynges aduersaries gatte one <hi>Lando d' Agobio</hi> to be theyr ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaine, who with the multitude folowyng hym, wolde kyll and murder as he wente by the stretes suche as the people appointed: so that the citee was no lesse afflicted with bloudshedde within, than scourched without by <hi>Vguicione,</hi> that euen than ouerranne all the countrey about.</p>
            <p>¶Net longe after <hi>Castruccio Castracani,</hi> a citesin of <hi>Lucca,</hi> gatte the dominion of <hi>Lucca</hi> and of <hi>Pisa,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so great, that he was made chief capitain of al the Ghibellines in Tuscane, so that folowyng his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he attempted to gette <hi>Prato,</hi> which the Florentines prepared theim selfes to defende, so makynge out an armie, and promisyng reconsilement to their banished men, <hi>Castruccio</hi> retired to <hi>Lucca</hi>: wherof folowed two inconueniences: one, the commons and rulers were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the people woulde haue pursued the ennemie, but the rulers wolde not: the other, by reason their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise toke small effecte, they refused their promyse concernyng their banished men, who therfore diuers tymes attempted by force, to haue their promise kepte.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18978:158"/>¶Finallie makyng out a newe armie against <hi>Castruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> vnder the leadyng of <hi>Raimondo da Cardona,</hi> the Florentines a little besides <hi>Alto Pastio</hi> were discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Raimondo slaine: in suche wise that the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines were no more able to holde vp their heades, but suffered <hi>Castruccio</hi> to ouerronne all their countrey, spoilyng and burnyng what he wolde. Wherfore the Florentines were faine to sue to king Robert of Naples for helpe: who enforced them to take his sonne Charles, Duke of Calabria, to be their lorde, and consequentelie sent the Duke of Athens, as his liuetenaunt to gouerne the citee,<note place="margin">

            <p>¶And like as the coming of Charles was a stay against <hi>Castruccio</hi>: euen so it was in maner as painefull to the citesins. For within lesse than a yere, he leuied of the citee .400000. Florines, notwithstandyng he had coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted before, not to take of them aboue .200000. besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that, after thei had gotten <hi>Pistoia, Castruccio</hi> laied siege therunto, so longe, that at last he gatte it from the Florentines: how be it, he immediately therupon died. and about the same tyme, the forenamed Charles, lorde of Florence died also. So that the citee was at ones deliuered bothe of the tyranne (as they call hym) and of the enemie: and therupon recoueryng theyr libertee, thei retourned to a new ordre of theyr common wealth.</p>
            <p>¶Not longe after themperour returnyng from Rome, and passyng towardes Lumbardie .800. horsemen of his retinue taried behind him, and sodeinly toke <hi>Lucca,</hi> whiche they offred to sell to the Florentines for .20000.

that they made open warre to gette it, but all in vaine, though they spent yet a great quantitee of money more than the summe that quietely they might haue had it for.</p>

siege to it. That notwithstandyng the Florentines went foorth with theyr bargaine, and bought it duryng the siege. Wherin the <hi>Pisani</hi> perseuered with suche force, that in despite of all the Florentines succours, at last they gatte it: so that the Florentines not onely lost theyr money, but also purchased theim selfes dishonour.</p>
            <p>¶This meane while the Florentines, seyng theyr owne debilitee and ill fortune, procured succours of the kyng of Naples, who sent the Duke of Athenes to be theyr capitaine. But he in steede of a capitaine that should defende and preserue theyr common wealth, contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse to get into fauour with the commons, and by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasyng and persecutyng of the nobilitee, toke vppon hym selfe the absolute power, and vsed the whole as his owne. He prohibited the rulers any more to assemble in the palaice, toke the ensignes from the <hi>Gonfaloners,</hi> brake the orders of iustice, deliuered all prisoners, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consiled them that were exiled, ordeined new taxes, and waged straungers, so that the citee was full of Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemen, who forbare not to violate all sortes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>¶Thus he continued .x. monethes, encreasyng daiely in tyrannie, to the hygh offence of the chiefe, and great hate of the people (who before fauoured hym) that at last the whole citee in .iii. dyuers partes, nobles, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and artificers conspyred against hym, and in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion assaulted and discoumfited his men, and besieged hym in the palaice. Out of the whiche they enforced him to sende <hi>Guglielmo da Scesi</hi> and his sonne. Whom they hewed and gnawed to pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ces in the market place.</p>
            <p>¶Finally the Duke fell to accorde, and renouncyng his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18978:159"/>
astate and title to the dominion, departed with bagge and baggage. Whervpon not onely Florence but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Arezzo, Volterra, Pistoia,</hi> and other citees therabou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes toke on theim theyr libertees: though they within short space after, yelded to Florence theyr wonted obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Than the citesins deuised a new ordre in their common wealth, wherin the nobles had so great aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritee, that they vsed theyr libertee in all thynges ouer the people: but that endured not longe: for the people rebelled, and by force depriued theim, erectyng magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of theim selfes. And though the nobles openly practised with theyr frendes abroade for succours, and fortified theyr houses withinfoorth, in suche wise, that Florence was full of armes: whervpon thei attempted to recouer theyr astate. Yet at length after many skyrmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, muche bloudsheed, and fyre, the people preuailed, and brought the nobilitee so low,<note place="margin">Nobilitee suppressed.</note> that they neuer durst arme theim selfes more, but became in maner vile and abiecte: so that from that tyme foorth Florence decaied bothe in courtesie and chiualrie.</p>
            <p>¶Thus they rested in quiete, till the yere .1353. In whiche tyme happened that notable plague, that Iohn Boccaccio so pitifully mencioneth in the beginnyng of his Decamerone, thoroughe whiche died in Florence 96000. persones. And thoughe the nobilitee was than oppressed, yet fortune wanted not meane to reyse new discencion amongest theim againe.</p>
            <p>¶Two families in Florence, Albizi and Ricci, fell at variaunce, betwene whom the whole citee was no lesse deuided, than it was firste betwene <hi>Bondelmonti</hi> and <hi>Vberti</hi>: or betwene <hi>Donati</hi> and <hi>Cerchi.</hi> And where
<pb facs="tcp:18978:160"/>
as longe before this time the names of Guelfe and Ghi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belline was in maner extincted and forgotten, <hi>Vguici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one de Ricci</hi> (thynkyng to abate the reputacion of the <hi>Albizi</hi>) renued the olde law,<note place="margin">1357.</note> that no <hi>Ghibelline</hi> should enioie magistrate within the citee. But the purpose of Ricci was cleane disapoincted. For where he thought to proue the Albizi to be Ghibellines, they contrary wise not onely proued them selues Guelfes, but chiefe of the Guelfes: and became so great in the citee, that at length they determined to vsurpe the dominion, whiche beyng discouered to the people, was occasion, that their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were sacked, and some burned, and they for the moste parte fledde: and those lawes, that the Guelfes had made before in preiudice of the other citesins, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked. So that those whiche were noted for Ghibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, findyng them selfes recouered in credite, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be partetakers, but rather desiryng to rule their whole common wealthe, practised a newe meane, howe by force they myghte a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>chieue their enterprise: and persuadyng the multitude to rebell against the lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, they did so muche, that (notwithstandyng the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was discouered before) yet the people so assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled out of all order, rennyng vp and downe here and there, spoilyng and burnyng, where as liked theim beste, that the power of the rulers coulde not refourme the mattier, and at length it grew to so great inconuenience, that the lordꝭ wer constreigned not onely to habandone the palaice, but also the whole dominion vnto the peoplꝭ furie, so that <hi>Michell di Lando</hi> a carder of woull, bare legged and all to torne, mounted vppe in to the hall of the palaice, with the standarde in his hande, and findyng
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18978:160"/>
no man there, tourned hym towardes the people, saie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng: Now you see this palayce, with the whole citee at your commaundement, what woull you due? wherunto the multitude aunswered, they wolde haue hym theyr Gonfalonere and lorde: whiche incontinentlie he toke vpon him: and disposyng him selfe to quiet the rumour, to finde the people occupied, he sente theym straighte to seke one Nuto, that had been minister of iustice before: whom he caused to be hanged by the legge in the market place, and there torne to peeces: and consequentelie proceded to other reformacions and lawes, as it seemed beste to him. But because the commons perceiued, that he preferred the chiefe men to dignitees and offices, and dyd not so muche regarde the commons as they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, thei rebelled againe against him, and drew them together to the churche of <hi>Santa Maria di Nouella,</hi> where they beganne to erecte newe officers, and to make newe lawes after their owne maner. The meane while Michell makyng him selfe stronge, departed out of the palaice to mete theym: but missyng one an other by a wronge waie, Michell at his retourne founde theym in the high streete: assaultyng of the palaice. Where he sette on theim, and so discomfited them, that part he constreigned to flee out of the citee, and part to caste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie their weapons. And (notwithstandyng his vile birthe) he was a man him selfe of a righte good nature, wise, and able to gouerne, yet coulde not his auctoritee so muche bridell the communaltee, but that thei deuided theim selfes in partes, the one of men of estimacion, whiche called theim selfes the people, and the other of the meane craftes, whiche called theim selfes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18978:161"/>¶Thus as thei liued fightyng and braulyng togethers, newes came to the counsaill, that <hi>Giannozo da Salerno</hi> (a capitaine of Charles of Duras, than bente to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere Naples) liyng at Boloigne, determined, with helpe of the banished men, to assaulte the citee beyng promised by theim of the citee to haue a gate deliuered vnto theim. Wherupon diuers were accused, amongest whom <hi>Piero,</hi> the chiefe of the <hi>Albizi</hi> was taken and put to execucion, and Charles <hi>Strozi</hi> fledde.</p>
            <p>¶The Florentines the better to mainteine theim selfes, reteigned Iohn Sharpe (surnamed Acuto by them) an english capitaine,<note place="margin">Iohn Sharpe.</note> than abidyng in Italie with a great retinewe, whose reputacion was suche, that well was that prince in Italie, that mighte haue his seruice in tyme of neede. For his power was so great, that whan he was out of wages, he woulde take one citee or an other, and vse it as his owne for the tyme, till occasion of seruice happened againe, and than wolde he sell it to that prince or common wealthe, that wolde geue moste for it.</p>
            <p>¶About this tyme two the chiefest citesins in Florence, <hi>George Scali</hi> and <hi>Thomas Strozzi,</hi> with their auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritee and credite amongest the people, dyd what they wolde righte or wronge, so that whan the capitaine of iustice wolde haue put to execucion a certaine offender their friende, they by force assaulted and sacked the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaines palaice, and deliuered the giltie: whiche acte offended not the capitaine alonelie, but also the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, so that <hi>George Scali</hi> was therfore taken, and against the common opinion (notwithstandyng the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

was beheaded: and diuers of his deerest frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des with him. Upon occasion of whose death moste parte of the citee was armed to strengthe the iustice. But whan he was deade, thei were not so soone vnarmed again. For the parties betwene the people of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and the commons did so kendle, that for the space of a whole yere, there was daielie fightyng betwene theim: in suche wyse that at lengthe by agreement of bothe partes, the Guelfes were reconsiled and restored to their wonted honour and rule ouer the citee,<note place="margin">138<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>¶Thus the Guelfes being in auctoritee, and fearing no man but <hi>Benedetto d' Alberti</hi> (a good man, riche, and of great auctoritee) because he was not of their secte, they found the meane to banish hym, and dyuers others that they thoughte contrarie to theim: and so settled the common wealth after their maner, and kepte it in quiet till the yere .1387. At whiche time <hi>Giangalcazo Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conti,</hi> Duke of Millaine toke his vncle <hi>Bernabo</hi> priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and made sharpe warres to the Florentines,<note place="margin">1390<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> so that (notwithstandyng their valiaunte resistence) gettyng all the countreis about, as Bolognia, Pisa, Perugia, and Siena, he was in so great towardenesse to winne Florence, that he caused a crowne of golde to be made, to the intente to crowne him selfe kyng of Italy, and had done it in dede, if death had not preuented him.</p>
            <p>¶Not longe after the commons vpon light occasion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled of new, and in great noumbre ranne to the house
<pb facs="tcp:18978:162"/>
of <hi>Veri di Medici,</hi> offeryng hym the rule of the astate: but he leadyng theim with hym to the high streete, and leauyng theim there, ascended into the palaice amongest the lordes, excusyng him selfe, that the people made him to come by force, and so with thankes of theim returned to the people, and persuaded them, that thei should haue theyr willes, so that thei woulde laie downe theyr wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. Whiche at his request they did.

            <p>¶Not longe after certaine of theim that were banished, beyng at Bolognia, determined vpon hope of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples inconstancie, to attempt the recouerie of theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to alter the astate of theyr citee: and so tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughe coumforte of one Piggiello, and of <hi>Barroccio Cauicci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But for all that, there was none that woulde assist theim. Wherfore they withdrew into a churche, and there some in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng were slaine, and the rest taken, examined and put to execucion.</p>
            <p>¶Besides this the Duke of Myllaine, whilest he war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the citee, practised secretly by meane of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished men, to winne it, but the thyng beyng discouered, was occasion of the banishement of a noumbre of cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins,<note place="margin">1400.</note> and than within two yeres died Giangaleazzo, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

he had warred with the Florentines .xii. yeres. So that the Florentines being peaced outwardely, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different quiete within theim selfes, made out theyr po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer against <hi>Pisa,</hi> and valiauntly gatte it.<note place="margin">1409.</note>

Where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with his power to proue his fortune. So that the death of these two princes, the Duke of Myl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine and the kynge of Naples, was more auailable to the Florentines, than theyr owne force. But they (whose nature coulde not well beare any rest) liued not fully .viii. yeres in peace, but that not onely the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties within them selfes renued theyr wonted contencion againe, but also the citee attempted warre against Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, than Duke of Myllaine: in whiche warre theyr ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie at <hi>Zagonara</hi> was discoumfited, and consequently all theyr holdes in <hi>Romagnia</hi> lost, <hi>Castracaro</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digliana</hi> excepted. Whervpon they made suite to the Uenetians, and obteined them in leage against the Duke. By whose meane at length they recouered theyr townes in <hi>Romagnia</hi>: notwithstandyng the charges of that warre had ben so great (amountyng to the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of thre millions and .500000. duckates) and that the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
<pb facs="tcp:18978:163"/>
fell out amongest theim selfes about the paiement thereof, whiche they called <hi>Catasto</hi>: and the citee of Uolterra rebelled against theim, though thei were soone brought to obedience againe.<note place="margin">1428.</note>
            </p>
            <p>¶After this beganne the Florentines to make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the towne of <hi>Lucca,</hi> whiche endured .iii. yeeres with wonderfull domage on bothe sides: specially on the Florentines, whose armie was discomfited by <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Piccinino,</hi> sent by the Duke of Myllaine to succour the Lucchese.</p>
            <p>¶Than beganne contencion within the citee betweene <hi>Cosmo de Medici</hi> and <hi>Rinaldo degli Albizi.</hi> Not that <hi>Cosmo</hi> (who was a iuste and a vertuouse man) gaue any occasion thereof. But vpon a consaite that <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi> suspected: seeyng that <hi>Cosmo</hi> with his liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee and vertue had gotten the loue of the people, he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined streight waie, that he went about to be lorde of al. Wherfore he so conspyred, and wrought against hym, that <hi>Cosmo</hi> was taken, laied in prison, and in daunger of death. But finally he was confined vnto <hi>Padoa</hi>: where he remaigned the space of a .xii. moneth, till by meane of his friendes he was reconsiled home, and his enemies some put to death, and the reste banisshed, and finally the whole astate of the common wealth refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med after his owne maner. Duryng whose tyme the Florentines endeuoured theim selfes muche to conquere the citee of <hi>Lucca,</hi> to the entreprise wherof they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined Francesco Sforza (that afterwardes was Duke of Myllaine) to be theyr generall. But because he than practised mariage with the daughter of Myllaine (whose father Duke Philip was enemie to the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18978:163"/>

            <p>¶Not longe after folowed the counsaile of Florence: at whiche the emperour of Greece, with the chiefe of the Greekishe churche assembled, and agreed with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine churche, though they stode not by it longe.</p>
            <p>¶Than arose Nicolo Piccinino, and without any iuste grounde moued warre to the Florentines, wherin he did theim no small displeasures. But finally he was discoumfited at <hi>Anghiari</hi>: and immediately after the <hi>Conte di Poppi</hi> (who before had assisted <hi>Piccinino</hi>) was besieged in his owne towne: and his whole astate, with the towne of <hi>Poppi</hi> taken from hym by the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines.</p>
            <p>¶And though the warre, whiche Piccinino made, was as well against the churche as the Florentines, so that the bishop of Rome, of the victorie of <hi>Anghiari,</hi> enioied as well his parte as the Florentines: yet the charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the cost that the bishop was at in pursuyng the victorie, was suche, that for verie neede of money: he solde <hi>Borgo san Sepolchro,</hi> vnto the Florentines for 25000. duckates. All this whyle were the Florenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in league with the Uenetians against the Duke of Myllaine, in suche wyse that the better to disburdeine his owne charge, the Duke steered kyng Alfonse of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples against the Florentines, who entred vpon Tuscane and did theim muche hurt, though at last laiyng siege to the towne of <hi>Piombino</hi> (through sickenesse that fell in
<pb facs="tcp:18978:164"/>
his armie) he was constreigned to remoue his siege, and vtterly to habandone his enterprise. But after Duke Phillip of Millaine was deade, and <hi>Francesco Sforza</hi> in possession of the astate, the Florentines (by meane of <hi>Cosmo di Medici</hi>) did enter in amitee with hym: for whiche occasion, whan the Uenetians were out with <hi>Francesco,</hi> they procured kyng Alfonse to warre of new on the Florentines, whiche warre was not so sharpe, but that the Florentines at length did passe it ouer with out any great losse.</p>
            <p>¶Than died <hi>Cosmo di Medici,</hi> whan he had gouerned the citee about .31. yeres.<note place="margin">1464. Cosmo di Medici.</note> He in his tyme was one of the notablest men of the worlde, the richeste priuate man that hath ben hearde of manie yeres, and so lyberall withall, that he relieued a number of his citesins, not onely with lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, but also with the gifte of large summes of money: and many times he wolde him selfe consider who had neede, and helpe them vndesired. His wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was suche (and was vnlearned) that he ruled the vnruliest citee of the worlde in peace without ciuile se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion, whiche before his tyme was neuer in quiete. And though he might haue taken on him selfe the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power without difficultee, beyng in suche auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, yet ledde he still a priuate life: nor for all his great richesse, neuer soughte other mariage for his doughters, than amongest his owne citesins. He builded .v. prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houses, one within the cite, and .iiii. without, besides iiii. monastaries .ii. churches, and dyuers chappelles: so that he that well considerith his doynges, shall iudge theim rather mightie kynges than citesins.</p>
            <p>¶Finally his factions were suche in Uenice, in Naples,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18978:164"/>
in Rome, and in other chiefe citees of trafficque, that whan he was so disposed, he wolde make them all bare of money: so that with his onely reputacion many times he wroughte suche quietnesse and commoditee to his citee, that all the Florentine power was not able to doe.</p>
            <p>¶The rule that he bare was not grounded on force or tirannie, but vpon suche a loue to the people, that whan he died, the commons bewailed hym as a father of the countrey. The profe wherof was well seen, what tyme through the yll procuremente of <hi>Diotisalui</hi> (one that he helde as his dere and secrete friende) a conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie was made against his sonne Peter.</p>
            <p>¶Whan the olde Duke Francesco Sforza was deade, and his sonne Galeazo established in the astate, the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours of Millaine came to the Florentines for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmacion of their former amitee, which Peter the sonne of <hi>Cosmo,</hi> persuaded, was necessary to be mainteigned. In debatyng of whiche mattier Peter beganne to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the intente of his aduersaries, and at length fully ascertained therof, he wrought so, that all the citee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med theim selfes in his fauour, in suche wise that beyng verie weake of bodie, and sicke on his bedde, the chiefe magistrates of the citee were faine to resorte to hym, and to offer theim selfes at his pleasure. Wherupon it folowed, that the pryncipall of his ennemies were some banished and some slaine, and his reputacion suche, that (though he ruled not in office him selfe) yet might be at all times commaunde and doe what he wolde, and folowyng alwaies the steppes of his father in the same reputacyon died.</p>
            <p>¶After whose deathe Italy happened to be deuided,
<pb facs="tcp:18978:165"/>
betwene the kynge of Naples and the bishop of Rome on the one parte, the Uenetians, the Duke of Millaine, and the Florentines on the other parte: and amongest all the reste the bishop of Rome hated the Florentines, speciallie the house of <hi>Medici,</hi> whereof two vertuouse yonge men, Iulian and Laurence, sonnes of the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Peter, were than rulers, and in maner (though thei liued priuately) princes of Florence, and this hate was not secret, for the bishop openlie in Rome fauoured the <hi>Pazi,</hi> and hindered the <hi>Medici,</hi> so that after the death of Phillip <hi>D' i Medici,</hi> archebishop of <hi>Pisa,</hi> the bishop of Rome placed in his steede <hi>Francesco Saluiati,</hi> a mortall ennemie to the house of <hi>Medici,</hi> who notwithstandyng the Romish election, coulde not be receiued of the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines.<note place="margin">Practise of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</note> Wherfore with the holy fathers consente this newe archebishop beganne a practise, to alter the astate of Florence, and consultyng on the mattier with diuers of his friendes, speciallie of the families of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiati</hi> and <hi>Pazi,</hi> concluded, that without the deathe of Iulian and Laurence <hi>D' i Medici,</hi> it was impossible to bryng the mattier to passe. Wherfore they procured the Cardinall of saincte George (nephewe vnto the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome) to come to Florence, to the intente that in visityng of him, they mighte haue bothe the brethern to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gethers, and so slea theim. Of this their purposed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente twise they missed. The therde tyme they deuised a solemne masse to be songe before the Cardinall, vnto the which bothe the brethern came, and at the eleuacion tyme Iulian was slaine, and Laurence hurte, but he es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped.</p>
            <p>¶This meane while the archebishop crately gotte into
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18978:165"/>
the palaice with certaine men with him, priuily armed, in hope that whan the rumour shoulde ryse he mighte haue not onely the palaice but also all the chiefe rulers of the citee in his handes: but his purpose beyng espied er he coulde atchieue it, he with certaine of his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were immediately hanged and throwen out at the wyndowes of the palaice. This foule ende had theyr cursed conspiracie: for whan Iulian was slayne, and Laurence returned to his house, it was a wonder to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> howe soone the people were armed, rennyng vp and downe the stretes, and criyng, <hi>Medici Medici,</hi> killyng and drawyng as many as they coulde know of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie parte. And almost there was no citesin of any reputacion, that came not vnto the house of Laurence, to offer him selfe and his goodes to succour him, in case he neded.</p>
            <p>¶Finallie the tumulte beeynge quieted, as manie as coulde be founde of the <hi>Saluiati</hi> and <hi>Pazi,</hi> and of the other conspiratours, were put to execucion: and the rest that fledde, were banished.</p>
            <p>¶But for all this theyr trouble ceased not. For whan the bishop of Rome sawe that this pryuie treason toke not effect in alteracion of the astate, he attempted open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the destruction of the citee, not vnder pretence of hate to the Florentines, but to the house of <hi>Medici</hi> onely. Fyrst he exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated the citie, and after sent an army of his owne againste theim, and procured the kynge of Naples to inuade them with an other armie: protestyng alwaies, that he desired no more, but to haue Laurence <hi>D' i Medici</hi> in his handes; whiche done, he offered to be at peace. Wherfore Laurence, to be the better assured
<pb facs="tcp:18978:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his citesins, called .300. of the best of them togethers, and resonyng the mattier with theim, founde theim wholy bent to his defence, and therupon made prouision of resistence, doyng all Italie to vnderstande, that the bishop of a shepherde, became a wolfe, and not onelie practised this secrete treason, but also openly mayntei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned it.</p>
            <p>¶These warres continued so longe, that the Florenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes beeyng destitute of all succour, and werie of theyr great charge and losse of men, determined to fall into the armes of the tone of theyr enemies, and esteemyng the kynges amitee more auailable and more durable of the bothe, Laurence <hi>Di Medici</hi> went hym selfe to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and so behaued him towardes the kyng, that where most men suspected, he should neuer retourne, he not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retourned, but also brought a perfite conclusion of peace with hym. Wherat the bishoppe of Rome was out measure wroth, but at last the Florentines sent their ambassadours to hym. Who beyng brought to audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Pontificalibus, at length obteined his absoluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The rather because euin than newly the Turke had assaulted and taken <hi>Otronto</hi> in <hi>Puglia,</hi> and mynded to conquere Italie: whiche occasion caused all the princes of Italie to vnite theim selfes together, more for feare than loue, as afterwardes did well appeare. For the Turke was no sooner dead, and the feare of his inuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paste, but they fell out againe as farre as euer they were. For betwene the bishop and the kynge grew hote warres, and the Florentines in helpe of the kynge as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted the bishop on the other side, and besides that the cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By meane wherof the Florentines with theyr more ease warred vpon the Genowaies, and gatte <hi>Pietra Santa,</hi> with other townes from theim, and gaue them a notable discoumfiture besides <hi>Serezana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶Finally the moste renoumed priuate man of his tyme Laurence <hi>D' i Medici</hi> died,<note place="margin">Laurence d' i Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> leauyng one of his sonnes a Cardinall (who was called therunto beyng not fullie 13. yeres old) and his eldest sonne Peter in great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion, and his doughters also verie well maried.</p>
            <p>¶He fauoured cunnyng men, specially theim that were learned: he was eloquente in reasonyng, quicke of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, wise in determinyng, and hardie in doyng. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the conspiracy wrought against hym, whan his brother was slayne, he was twyse in peryll of death by treason, and yet preuented theim bothe to the confusion of the conspiratours. All the princes of Italy honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hym, the kynge Mathew of Hungarie shewed hym great signes of loue, the Soldan of Aegypt sent hym presentes and ambassadours, the Turke deliuered <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo Bandini,</hi> that slewe his brother Iulian, into his handes: and his owne citesins so muche loued him, that I thynke of his tyme died no man happier than he. Contrary wise his sonne <hi>Peter di Medici,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng his gentle enterteigment of all men at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng (whiche made the worlde to hope well of him) did at length proue so ambiciouse, so wilfull and so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discrete in his procedynges, that neither the magistrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
<pb facs="tcp:18978:167"/>
the citesins, nor yet the people could well beare him, to the encrease wherof,<note place="margin">1495.</note> whan Charles the .viii. Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che kynge, passed by Florence towardes Naples, Peter mette hym on the waie, and saied to him, that his father commaunded hym .iii. thynges, the fyrst to honour God, the secounde to worship the frenche kyng, and the thyrd to defende his countrey. So that Charles seeyng hym thus well disposed, entreated hym so fayre, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered into his handes <hi>Serezana, Pietra Santa,</hi> and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally sette <hi>Pisa</hi> at libertee, whiche was so great a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunce to the Florentine astate, that the magistrates and commons, moued of iuste disdeigne, draue him out of the citee, toke his goodes and patrimonie as forfaicte, and condemned him to perpetuall exile, with a noumber of his friendes and partetakers: and the furie of the people was suche, that they brake and defaced all the armes that coulde be founde of the Medicies in Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>¶And albeit that he attempted manie waies to recouer his countrey, yet was his fortune so yll, that the more he sturred, the more was he hated, whiche at lengthe was the vndoyng both of him selfe, and of a great many mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as well of his adherentes, as of his aduersaries.</p>
            <p>¶Thus the familie of Medici loste reputacion and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite for the tyme: so that the astate of Florence retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the common rule of the magistrates and cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins,<note place="margin">1495.</note> that endured till the tyme that Leo the .x. of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of <hi>Medici</hi> was made bishop of Rome, who though he restored not his house vnto the full rule they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the citee, did neuerthelesse so muche, partely with auctoritee, and partely by friendship, that diuers of that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18978:167"/>
name were receiued and made partetakers of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth: whiche by little and little so encreased a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that in the tyme of bishop Clement the .vii. who also was of the Medici, whan the Duke of Burbon pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Florence to Romewardes, the commons of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee made a commocion against <hi>Hippolito di Medici,</hi> then gouernour of the same: he than beyng departed out of the citee in companie of the Cardinall of <hi>Cortona,</hi> to goe visite the Duke of Urbine. But assoone as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned, he did so muche, that they yelded theim selfes againe vnto hym, vpon couenant he should hurt no man for that mattier.</p>
            <p>¶Than bishop Clement made this <hi>Hippolito</hi> a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, whervpon he lefte the administracion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and so was the citee at libertee againe. But Clement beeyng determined to make it perpetuall subiect to his owne famili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, handled hym selfe so well towardes the emperour at his coronacion at Boloigne, that he obteigned the imperiall power to the oppression of his owne naturall countrei, and brought to passe, that the prince of Orenge,<note place="margin">1530.</note> with the emperours army besieged Florence.</p>
            <p>¶This siege, endured a whole yere, which for the many enterprises and battailes fought on bothe partes, maie be compared to the best Troiane, Greekish or Romaine warres, namely because the common wealth alone, with out helpe of any other prince or state, susteigned the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of two so mightie powers as the emperours and the bishops of Rome, vntill famine and not force ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came theim.</p>
            <p>¶Finally the prince of Orenge, and dyuers other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="tcp:18978:168"/>
capitaines beyng slaine in the often battailes and skyrmisshes, at last the Florentines for lacke of vittail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, were faine to fall to composicion, and yelded vpon these condicions, that the citee should continue in hir li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertee, referryng the reformacion of thastate to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who within the terme of .iiii. monethes should thervpon declare his pleasure. That all banished men should be reconciled without remembraunce of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie before passed. That the Medici should be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to theyr goodes taken from theim by violence of the magistrates. That the citee shoulde paie .80000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> crownes to the dispatche of the armie, with other coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes of lesse moment. Upon whiche accorde Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew <hi>Valori,</hi> commissarie for the bishop of Rome, entred with dyuers of the imperiall capitains, and there behaued theim selfes so stoutely, that (notwithstandyng the couenauntes of peace) they founde the meane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lesse than a moneth to behead .vi. of the chiefest cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins, and to confine .150. besides a noumbre of others that habandoned and fledde the citee of them selfes: so that theyr promysed libertee was tourned into a moste cruell seruitude.</p>
            <p>¶Shortely after came Alexander <hi>Di Medici,</hi> nephew to bishop Clement, sente by the emperour out of Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who at his first comyng made a shew of sobrietee, in goyng priuately vnto his house, and receiuyng the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesins amiably: but yet at lengthe by little and little he vsurped the offices and magistrates, and finally dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed theim all at his pleasure,<note place="margin">1532.</note> causyng him selfe openlie to be called Duke.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Di Medici</hi> and <hi>Saluiati,</hi> with the principall of the other banished Florentines (couetyng the recouerie of their citees libertee) sent ambassadours to the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, besechyng hym to consider the tyrannie of Duke Alexandre (who than newly had builded the <hi>Cittadella</hi>) and to regarde the condicions of peace. Whiche am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours arriued at <hi>Barcelona</hi> euen as the emperour was takyng shippe towardes the enterprise of Tunise: so that beyng returned to Rome, the Cardinall <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito di Medici</hi> disposed hym selfe to goe vnto Tunise therfore. And takyng his iourney towardes Naples died at <hi>Itri</hi> by the waie: poysoned (as the voice wente) by procurement of Duke Alexander.</p>
            <p>¶This Duke Alexander was yet but yonge, who by bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop Clementes procurement had maried the emperours bastarde doughter, he was so stoute, that without any respecte he wolde haue his will in all thynges, and namely in feates of loue and chaunge of women was his speciall delite. And amongest all other he delited more in the company of <hi>Laurence di Medici</hi> (that should suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede him in the astate) than of any other man. But Laurence in steede of that loue hated the Duke, and had longe time determined to slea him, whan he might finde occasion, whether he did it in hope the rather to atteigne to the dominion him selfe, or to restore to the citee hir auncient libertee, be diuers opinions.</p>
            <p>¶In effecte without makyng any man priuie to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, other than a seruante of his owne, the Duke beyng on a nighte all alone in Laurences house, and slepyng on a bedde, Laurence and his man slewe him: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon counsailyng with certayne of his friendes, and

            <p>¶This Duke Cosmo sued first to marrie with the wife of Duke Alexander the emperours doughter, but the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome that nowe is, purchaced hir (to his no small coste) for his sonnes sonne, Duke <hi>Octauio.</hi> For the whiche there hath ben mortall hate betwene Duke Cosmo and the bishop.

               <p>ALl the Genowaies in maner are merchaunt men, and verie great trauailers of straunge countreys. For I haue ben reasonablie persuaded, that there be .5. or .6. thousande of them continually abroade, either merchauntes or factours: so that they leaue few places
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18978:172"/>
of the worlde vnsought: where any gaine is to be had. For the merchaundise that they bringe home hath spedie dispatche, by reason theyr citee is as a keye vnto all the trade of Lumbardie, and to a great part of Italie. They at home make suche a noumbre of silkes and vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uettes, as are hable to serue many countreys: whiche is the chiefe merchaundise that they sende foorth. In deede they are commonly noted to be great vsurers.</p>
               <p>¶One thyng I am sure of, that if Ouide were nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyue, there be in <hi>Genoa,</hi> that coulde teache him a dousen poinctes <hi>De Arre Amandi.</hi> For if <hi>Semiramis</hi> were euer celebrated amongest the <hi>Assirians, Venus</hi> amongest the Greekes, <hi>Circes</hi> amonge the Italians, sure there be dames in <hi>Genoa</hi> that deserue to be celebrated and chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicled for their excellent practise in loue. And trulie the Genowaies theim selfes deserue that their wyfes should be praised, because I saw in no place where wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue so muche libertee. For it is laufull there openly to talke of loue, with what wife so euer she be. insomuche that I haue seene yonge men of reputacion standyng in the strete talke of loue with yong mistresses beyng in theyr wyndowes aboue: and openlie reherse verses that they had made one to the other. And in the churches, specially at euensong, they make none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praiers. So that he that is not a louer there, is meete for none honest companie. Manie men esteme this as a reproche to the Genowaies, but they vse it as a policie: thynkyng that their wifes through this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of open speache, are ridde of the rage that maketh other women to trauaile so muche in secret.</p>
               <p>¶In dede the women there ar excedyng faire and beste

For thoughe their vppermost garment be but plaine clothe, by reason of a law, yet vnderneth they weare the finest silkes that may be had, and are so finely hosed and shoed, as I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sawe the like, open faced, and for the most parte bare headed, with the heare so finely trussed and curled, that it passeth rehersall. So that in myne opinion the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame courte of loue is no where to be soughte, out of Genoa.</p>
               <p>¶But like as the women are excellente in this, euen so doe the men excede all other in supersticion. For there be within the citee .20. scholes or companies of discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes otherwise called <hi>Battuti,</hi> whose maner is whan they are called to deuocion, as euery good fridaie, or in the middest of a plage, of famine, of warre, or of other like occasion, that requireth or rogacions suche processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thei assemble and clothe them selfes in sacke, linnen or buckeramme: with their backes naked, and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces couered, sauyng littell holes to loke out at. And hauyng certaine skourges or whippes (some of wyer) in their handes, they goe about the towne whyppyng theim selfes, that the bloud shall renne from the backe downe to the heeles, so painefully, that it moueth the poore people to compassion.

And yet his Mylanese dominion is not halfe so muche at this present, as that that diuers Dukꝭ of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine haue had. For wheras the emperour, besides the citee of Myllaine hath now .vii. or .viii. citees, as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia, Lodi, Cremona, Alexandria, Vercelli, Nouara,</hi> and <hi>Como</hi>: Dukes of Myllaine haue had, some .xx. and some .xxx. citees, and vpwardes. Yea and some so great, that they haue aspyred to the dominion ouer all Italie: as in the briefe historie folowyng more plainely appeareth. Neuerthelesse he that now shall happen to see the company of noble men and gentilmen, that ar in maner continually attendaunt on themperours lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt or deputie in Myllaine, shall saie, that the same representeth rather the courte of some puissaunt kynge, than the traine of a deputie.</p>
            <p>¶And I thynke verily, that <hi>Don Ferrando Gonzaga,</hi> now lieuetenaunt there, rideth many times more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably accompanied, and with a greatter presence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistee,
<pb facs="tcp:18978:199"/>
than the emperour him selfe dooeth in Germanie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Wiues of Millaine.</note>¶The like wherof with rather the more is to be saied of the Mylanese gentilwomen, who in sumptuouse ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraile maie compare with the best: specially in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes of theyr Chariottes, with coueringes of cloth of golde, of veluettes, of silkes, and a thousande sortes of embroderies. There is almost no craftesmans wife in Myllaine, that hath not hir gowne of silke, and hir chaine of golde. A thyng that shoulde seeme rather meruailouse than credible. But the craftesmen there are so excellent in theyr dooynges, and the women so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perte in silke workes, that it is no wonder though their gaine grow to the biyng of gaie geare.</p>
            <p>¶Finally the citee of Myllaine standyng in the herte of the pleasauntest and fayrest plaine of all Christendome,<note place="margin">Millaine S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Honourable for the courte, gallaunt for gentilmen, herborough for souldiours, delicate for dames, riche for merchauntes, and wealthy for artificers. But for notable or sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouse buildynges, it maie not be compared with Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, Rome, or Florence. For all be it, the houses be great and fayre within, yet outwardely it is nothyng of that beautie and pompe, that those other citees be: by reason that for the most parte the Mylanese buildyng is all of bricke, because harde stone and marble is not to be had by a great waie of.</p>
            <p>¶Neuerthelesse the <hi>Domo</hi> of Myllaine (beyng theyr Cathedrall churche) is one of the rarest woorkes of our tyme: built all of fine marble, so well grauen and cutte, that the woorkemanship is a wonder. But it is of so

vnmeasurable greatnesse, that most men doubt, whether euer it woull be finished or not: thoughe it haue many thousande duckates of yerely reuenew in good land to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the continuaunce, and a noumbre of woorkemen daiely labouryng theron.</p>
            <p>¶But what speake I of the churche,<note place="margin">Castell of Millaine.</note> the castell of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine being so neere? whiche in mine opinion is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest and strongest of all Europe.

               <p>¶This comyng of the Frenche kynge not onely annoied Alfonso, but also troubled all Italy.</p>
               <p>¶Finally he made warre against the Uenetians, which dured till that after the death of kynge Charles, Lewys succeded in the realme of Fraunce: who hated so muche this Duke <hi>Moro,</hi> that beyng entred in leage with the Uenetians: <hi>Moro</hi> was constreigned to flee into Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, where he remained whilest the Frenchemen toke Millaine, and the Uenetians <hi>Cremona</hi> and <hi>Gieradadda.</hi> How be it not longe after the Frenchemen through their yll gouernaunce were driuen from Millaine, and <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uico</hi> reuoked home out of Douchelande, who after his arriuall, takyng Neuara, and trauaylyng to chace the Frenche men out of Italy, was betraied of the Douche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and bothe he and <hi>Ascanio</hi> taken and ledde into Fraunce, where finally he died.</p>

the emperour.</p>
               <p>¶Finally he went vnto <hi>Cremona,</hi> till after the taking of sainct <hi>Polo,</hi> the Frenchemens dooynges in Italie went all to wracke. Wherfore seeyng the emperour Charles the .v. that nowe is come to <hi>Bologna</hi> to bee crowned, he went simplie thither vnto hym: and there submittyng hym selfe with iust excuses, recouered his magistees fauour, with restitucion of the astate of Myl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, vpon these condicions folowyng: That the Duke shoulde marie the emperours neece, daughter of the kynge of Denmarke and of the emperours syster: that he shoulde paie the emperour nine hundreth thousande duckates in tenne yeres by equall porcions: And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that diyng without issue, he should leaue his astate of inheritaunce to the emperour.</p>
               <p>¶Incontinently vpon which agrement <hi>Alexandro Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuogli,</hi> as vice Duke, with diuers other officers, were sent to Myllaine, to leauey the fyrste paiemente of this money: whiche was easily gathered vp. For the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanese couetyng the retourne of theyr Duke (whom for his gentill and temperate gouernance in tymes past thei hertilie loued) sticked not to streigne them selfes for his reliefe, in suche wyse, that thoughe theyr customes and taxes were doubled by reason of these paiementes: yet theyr hope of better life to come vnder their Duke, made theim not to esteeme theyr present charges.</p>
               <p>¶Than came themperours neece, the daughter of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, to Myllaine, and there was most solemnely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with infinite triumphes: and finally maried to the Duke in presence of the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> with suche feastes and plaies afterwardes, as so great a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

requyred.</p>
               <p>¶But ere a yere went about, the Duke (through great infyrmitee, blinded of one eye) died without issue: lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng the astate of Myllaine wholly to the emperour, who euer sens hath gouerned the same by his lieuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes. The fyrst wherof was named <hi>Antonio di Leua,</hi> so lame a man of his limmes, that he vsed to be caried on mens shoulders: but on the other side so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ware a capitaine in his doyngꝭ, as in his daies was not lyghtly to be founde againe.</p>
               <p>¶Next vnto whom folowed the Marques of <hi>Vasco,</hi> a verie honourable and courtly man, but not altogether man, but not altogether so happie in his procedinges as suche noble men couette to be.</p>
               <p>¶Finally after his death the emperour hath placed there the famouse <hi>Don Ferrando Gonzaga,</hi> vncle to the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>: whose prosperitee hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been great in feates of warre, but also wonderfull in purchasyng of fame, through the sincere and rare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministracion of iustice, that he vseth.</p>
               <p>¶I call it not rare for other cause, than for the rare correction he hath vsed against the offendours: wherby he hath wonne the hertes of theim that loue iustice.</p>
               <p>¶As for the progresse of the thynges happened in the state of Myllaine, sens the death of <hi>Francesco Sforza</hi> (in whom it semeth the house of <hi>Visconti</hi> to haue taken his ende) I shall not neede here to make any rehersall, because on the one syde the dooynges of the same haue not been verie great: and on the other side they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and fimiliare.</p>

            <p>¶The dominion that the Duke hath is not great, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of circuite nor of reuenew.

                  <hi>BY</hi> agreement of most aucthours I fynde, that the people of <hi>Mantua</hi> are descended of those auncient Tuscanes, that before the siege of Troie departed out of Lydia in Asia, and vnder the leadyng of theyr prince <hi>Tirreno,</hi> came and enhabited the region of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie.

Some of whiche streetes lacke little of a myle longe, with the goodly houses and buildynges on bothe sides so fayre and vniforme, that it seemeth all dooen at one tyme and by one agreement, as no doubte the most part hath been in deede. And than in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb facs="tcp:18978:218"/>
it hath a verie fayre greene, appoincted out for the markette place. But the Duke that now is, hath had no mynde to folow it, although his father <hi>Alfonso</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed the most trauaile of all his daies about it, to his wonderful charge: as he that shall see it maie wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider. So that the most habitacion of people resteth still in the olde parte of the citee, whiche is also indifferent fayre: but nothyng comparable to the new. Than as touchyng the greatnesse, I thynke the circuite by the walles be little lesse than .v. myles. And finally for strength it hath the goodliest and strongest wall, and the largest diche, well watered, that I haue seen: specially for three partes to the lande warde. And as for the fourth part, though the wall be not so stronge, yet is it reputed of no lesse force on that side, than on the other: by reason that within .20. yardes of the wall, the great riuer of <hi>Pò,</hi> hath his course downe towardes the sea: whiche renneth so swifte, and is so broade and deepe, that it is not to be passed of any enemie to geue assaulte to the towne.</p>
            <p>¶The Duke hath vnder his dominion two other citees, that is to wete, <hi>Modona,</hi> and <hi>Reggio,</hi> with a good parte of the low countreys of <hi>Romagna,</hi> and maie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende yerely by estimacion betwene .200. and .250000. duckates: and is esteemed verie riche, because he hath had no warre, nor other charge of importaunce, for the space of .xiii. yeres or more, that he hath gouerned the astate.</p>

               <p>LYke as of other places be diuers opinions: euen so is there of the beginnyng, and name of Ferrara. Some woull, that the name therof hath growen of a certaine quantitee of yron, that the same citee yelded for a tribute vnto the lorde of <hi>Rauenna</hi>: as <hi>Argenta,</hi> and <hi>Aureolo</hi> haue also dooen of the paiement of siluer and golde. Some other woull, that it be so called of the mynes of yron that haue been founde there: whiche opinion is most sensible, consideryng that Ferrara (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the vse of the latine tounge) signifieth none other but the place where yron is digged foorth, as Caesare in his commentaries, the .viii. boke of the Frenche war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and as Liuie in the fourthe of the Macedonicall warres dooe affyrme.</p>
               <p>¶But to passe ouer these antiquitees, and come nerer to our purpose, I finde,<note place="margin">700.</note> that the saied citee of Ferrara was firste closed with walles by one <hi>Smeraldo,</hi> capitaine for the Greekish emperour in <hi>Rauenna</hi>: and longe time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (beyng a certaine space vnder the obedience of Henry the secounde emperour of Almaine) it was recouered by the counteise Matilda, doughter of the Conte Bonefacio,<note place="margin">1020<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

vnder condicion, that thei shoulde for euer holde it in fee of the churche of Rome.</p>
               <p>¶And to resite the beginnyng of that house, some thinke the same is descended of those aunciente Troianes, that came with Anthenor into Italy: and some other woull, that their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the furie of the people was so moued therby, that takyng weapon in harde, they sought hym, and as he woulde haue fledde out at the Lyon gate, slew hym.

            <p>¶These two citees of late apperteined vnto the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Rome. But Paule the thyrde, now bishop of the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Romaine of nacion, of the house of <hi>Farnesi,</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:18978:223"/>
to encrease his owne familie, founde the meane to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate these two citees with theyr territories from the churches dominion: and to geue it vnto his owne sonne named Peter <hi>Aluigi,</hi> creatyng hym Duke therof. And in recompence annexed vnto the churche the Duchie of <hi>Camerino,</hi> that he before had taken by force from the Duke of Urbine.</p>
            <p>¶This <hi>Pietro Aluigi,</hi> beeyng the yeere of our lorde 1546. entred into the astate, beganne to beare hym selfe ouerstoutely against the nobilitie of the same, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towardꝭ the <hi>Signor Ieronimo Pallauicini di Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Maggiore,</hi> who rather disdeigning then enuiyng this mans dominion, was faine at last to flee, and to haban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done wyfe and children, gooddes and landes. Insomu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che that this new Duke toke all vnto him selfe, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the castell of <hi>Corte maggiore</hi> (beyng a veraie stronge holde) with his owne men, toke all the rentes (beyng .12000. duckates a yere) to his owne purse: excepte a small porcion assigned to the ladie wife of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronimo,</hi> for hir liuyng: with condicion neuerthelesse, that if she reliued hir husbande with any part therof, she should lose the whole. Besides this, he oppressed his subiectes, causyng theim to bie harneis, and to furnishe them selfes for the warre on theyr owne cost. But most of all he occupied a great noumbre of labourers in his woorkes, beginnyng the foundacion of a stronge castell, in the place where the Abbey of S. Bennettes in <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia</hi> stode. The monkes wherof he appoincted vnto a spittle hous, called sainct Lazares in Champaine.

            <p>¶Finally these gentilmen (foreseeyng the daunger that for this doyng might folowe vnto them, in case the state shoulde continue of the churche) practised before with <hi>Don Ferrando Gonzaga,</hi> to see whether he wolde backe them, by receiuyng the stronge citee of Placense vnto the emperours behoufe: so that beyng at a poinct with him, the mattier was so handled, that the nexte night after the Dukes death, there were secretly receiued into the towne .800. of the emperours men, and so the citee wonne without stroke strickyng.</p>
            <p>¶All the money, plate, iewelles and stuffe that coulde be founde of the Dukes, to the value of .30000. crownes and vpwardes, were diuided amongest the confederates, and the <hi>Conte Giouanni Aguzzolo,</hi> who kylled the Duke his owne handes, allowed by the emperour .20. men for his garde.</p>

               </gap>yne hylles, in maner betwene the marke of <hi>Ancona</hi> &amp; <hi>Tuscane,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wherof (as Plinie writeth) haue ben surnamed <hi>Metaurensi,</hi> and it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue taken name of <hi>Vrbes Binae,</hi> two townes. For who that well considereth the proporcion of it, shall iudge by the miter facion therof, that it hath been two townes ioigned together, and the middell, whiche is a holow descent betwene two hillꝭ, is the sklenderest part of the citee.</p>
            <p>¶The Dukes palaice is a verie faire house, but not so excellent as the <hi>Conte Baldasar</hi> in his Courtisane doeth commende it.</p>
            <p>¶The Dukes dominion is two citees, <hi>Vrbine</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saro</hi>: his reuenew passeth not .60000. crownes by the yere. But his auncestours for the most parte serued o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther astates, as the Duke that now is also doth: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:18978:225"/>
they kepte muche greatter portes than their owne habilitee wolde beare.</p>
            <p>¶Amongest other this Dukes father builded an house within a mile of <hi>Pesaro,</hi> called <hi>Imperiale,</hi> whiche in mine opinion is one of the best deuised litle thynges that may lightly be founde. It standeth on the syde of an hyll, and hath prospect bothe to the citee and to all the valey, it hath many fine little chambers, goodly open vaultes, and excellent faire fountaines. But that whiche most of all pleased myne eye, was that being of a great height, you may out of the highest gardeine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yde about on the toppe of the house, which is very faire paued with bricke, and railed on bothe sides with fine pillers and railes of white marble.</p>
            <p>¶As for the edificacion of Urbine, or other notable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory before the yere .1345, I finde nothyng mete to be written. At whiche time (by reason of the variaunce betwene bishop Clement of Rome, and the emperour Lewis of Bauarie, who to make their parties stronge, made diuers new lordes in Italy) <hi>Galasso di Montefel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro</hi> was made vicare for the emperour in the citees of Urbine and Eugenio,<note place="margin">Galasso di Montefel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro .1345.</note> against the bishop of Rome and his adherentes: in whiche his succession continued enheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours vnto the yere .1444. that Federike, after made Duke,<note place="margin">Conte Guido .1428.</note> obteigned the astate. The occasion wherof was, that <hi>Guido Conte di Vrbino,</hi> hauyng no heire male by his firste wife, feigned, that he had gotten a Concubine with childe, and so secretly toke the sonne of his nere kinnesman <hi>Bernardino della Corda,</hi> whiche euen than was newly borne, and namyng it Federike, caused it to be nourished as his owne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:18978:225"/>¶Not longe after his wife died, and mariyng agayne, engendred a sonne named <hi>Oddo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oddo .1440.</note> who in deede succeded the father in his astate. But he was so viciouse of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, and so busie with gentilmens wifes, that in a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein rumour of the people, he was slaine, and a Protono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, called <hi>Carpesiano</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>¶Wherupon this Federike the putatiue sonne,<note place="margin">Federico<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1444.</note> by the whole voice of the people was elected their prince: who in his youthe had ben verie well brought vp, specially in feates of armes, in the exercise wherof he loste one of his eyes.</p>
            <p>¶This Federike was not onely valiaunte, but also verie well learned, and so happie a man, that in his tyme he was generall of .viii. seuerall armies, and died capitaine of the Uenetians armie in the fielde before <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶The bishop of Rome for his worthinesse made hym Duke, the kyng of Englande not onely gaue him money, but also made hym of the Garter. For whiche curtesy all Englishe men haue a certaine priuilege of freedome in his dominion, and the Frenche kyng made him also of his order. Besides that, there was none astate in Italy, but that at one tyme or other presented hym with some worthy gifte.</p>
            <p>¶And aboue all the rest his fidelitee seemeth to me most worthy of commendacion. For whan <hi>Francesco Sforza,</hi> was forsaken of all his other friendes, and pursued with 20000. men, he onely receiued him, and therby putte him selfe and his whole astate in ieopardy, which he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned rather to lose, than to seeme an vnfaithfull friende, and in effecte mainteigned <hi>Sforza</hi> till time serued him to recouer.</p>

                  </gap>2.</note>¶After the death of Federike, his sonne <hi>Guido Vbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> of the age of .xii. yeres succeded, who reigned quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about .xxi. yeres, till the comyng of <hi>Valentino Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> sonne of Alexandre the .vi. bishop of Rome: that fyrst by suche crafte gatte the astate into his handꝭ, that <hi>Guido Vbaldo</hi> was faine to flee disguised in plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans clothyng. Neuerthelesse through the good will of his subiectes he recouered his astate in shorte tyme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. But Ualentines force was suche, that at length this Duke toke suche treasure as he had, and fledde to the Marques of <hi>Mantua,</hi> whose sister he had maried: &amp; there diyng without issue, ended the house of <hi>Montefel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro,</hi> that had reigned in Urbine the space of .157. yeres.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ualentino Borgia .1503.</note>¶<hi>Valentino Borgia</hi> helde it but a verie smalle space, for shortly after his fathers death, Iulie the seconde bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome persecuted him, and brought the house of <hi>Borgia</hi> to naughtes: and thervpon gaue the astate of Urbine to his nephiew <hi>Francesco Maria Prefettino del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Rouere</hi>:<note place="margin">Francesco Maria .1504.</note> whom he created Duke there.</p>
            <p>¶This <hi>Francesco Maria</hi> was a verie wise and valiant prince, nothing inferiour to Federike beforenamed: who reigned not fully .x. yeres, but <hi>Leo</hi> the x. that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded Iulie the .ii. made a puissaunt armie, and expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him out of his astate,<note place="margin">1514.</note> and rased the walles of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee euen to the earth. Whervpon he established his nephiew <hi>Iuliano di Medici</hi> Duke in his place,<note place="margin">Iulianio di Medici Laurence di Medici.</note> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death (for he liued but a while) his brother Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <hi>di Medici</hi>: who continued in the same, till Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an the .vi. that succeded Leo,<note place="margin">1522.</note> expulsed him, and restored the astate vnto <hi>Francesco Maria,</hi> that enioyed it till he died, the space of .xvi. yeres in so great reputacion, that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18978:226"/>
all princes and astates of Italie loued and honored him: and the greatest of them were glad to enterteine hym for their generall in the warres. Wherin he gatte infinite summes of money. But he was so great a builder and so liberall vnto his souldiours, that whan he died, he lefte no kynde of money in his coffers.</p>
            <p>¶By his life tyme he builded the palaice besides <hi>Pesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> called <hi>Imperiale,</hi> and fortified the citee of <hi>Pesaro,</hi> and the castel there, with diuers other goodly buildyngꝭ: and gatte Katherine daughter and heyre to the Duke of Camerine to be maried vnto his sonne <hi>Guido Vbaldo,</hi> that now liueth. In whose right he enioyed that astate duryng the fathers lyfe.</p>
            <p>¶Assoone as <hi>Francesco Maria</hi> was dead,<note place="margin">Guido Ubaldo .2. 1538.</note> Paule the iii. now bishop of Rome, seyng this Duke that now ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a younge man, without money or great friendes, made so great a power against him, that for feare to lose the whole, he was contente for a little money and some other small recompences, to yelde to the bishoppe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of Camerine: whiche the bishop hitherto enioyeth. And yet for all this, the same bishoppe hath founde the meanes to marie his neece to the same Duke:<note place="margin">1547<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> wherat many men meruaile not a little.</p>
            <p>¶Finally this Duke <hi>Guido Vbaldo</hi> is generall ouer all the Uenetians landes, townes, and fortresses, and hath of theim .10000. crownes annuitee. But hitherto he hath had none occasion of triall in the warres. He is meane of strature, hard of fauour, and very graue in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaunce. And though he be well learned, his wysedome hath had no great triall as yet, but men trust he woll proue as vertuouse as his predecessours.</p>
