            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

placed together in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the eyes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to giue light to his whole vnderstanding.

And that whereas they thought themselues to be wyse without it, they neuer came to the first step thereof, it being as Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sayth: that The feare of the Lord (which such haue neglected) is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of wysedome.

And therefore when soeuer we leaue this light, though the lampe of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s braine burne neuer so bright, we fall perforce in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end: For neither the wyse head of Achitophell, nor the fayre and flattering face of Absolon that stale from Dauid the peoples hartes, coulde preuaile in their purposes, so pollitickly attempted against the rule of Religion, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it turned to their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion: <note place="margin">Matt. <hi>15.</hi>

But greatly are these likewyse deceiued: for wysedome is no wysedome and not to be accompted of in anye, so longe as it is dissembled and not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, that other men maye see good proofe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

For wher as their doctrine is so on all sides wounded and foyled by the force of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that they haue no shift to vphold their treachery as men euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye conuinced and condemned by lawe and iustice, now are they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to practise some pollicy, seing they are spoyled both of the word and the sword. And for want of better practise their onelye shifte is by spreading open other mens infirmities to couer their owne, by lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the leude liues of the Protestants to the vewe of all men, to shadow the horrours of their Church, in somuch that their outcryes are growne so great, that these spitefull speaches are often and dayly heard vpon euerye occasion: Lo these are oure Protestants: Such are oure Gospellers: to such miserye and wickednes is the worlde growne since this new doctrine came among vs: ye maye see by their fruite what their Religion is. So outragious are the outcryes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they make against vs to discredite not vs but our Gospel, as though the defacing of vs by our sinnefull liues, were a confutacion of oure doctrine, and an approuing of their innocencye, and a confirmation of theyr vnclenlye dregs to be pure and good. So vehement are their speaches, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with such confidence on their partes, as if both theyr doctrine were on all sides true, and that the spirit of God had cleane forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this age, as if the like wickednes had neuer tainted any kind of men so haynously as it doth the professours of the Gospell, and as though sinne were but newe borne among men and latelye sprong vp wyth the Gospell: and as thoughe that the tree whereon their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is grafted (the Church of Rome I meane) had neuer yelded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rotten fruite, had neuer any catterpillers breeding in it, neuer any cankar corrupting it, but had euer bin greene, fresh and flourishing, pure and perfite in euerye leafe, braunche and twig. Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning vs and concerning them I will speake of both.</p>
            <p>And first as concerning our selues (God be merciful vnto vs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
<pb facs="tcp:711:8"/>
sinners) we haue al runne astray, If we say we haue no sinne we deceyue our selues and the truth is not in vs: There is not one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doth good no not one. And if any Papist, Turke or infidel charge vs to be sinnefull men although we professe a pure Gospell, we will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, and neuer like the worse of them for so sayinge, nor the better of our owne infirmityes. Nowe concerning the Papistes, if they speake of our sinnes for that they hate sinne in vs, they do vs no wronge, we accept it and thancke them for it: But if they laye the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of our sinnes vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorious Gospel of Christ which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, &amp; if they meane by defacing vs to discredite it (as I haue sayde before) then do they offer great iniurye to the Maiesty of God, when as they say that by our deedes it appeareth, as by the fruite y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the tree is not good, that the Gospell which we professe is not perfite. Wee cannot and may not suffer it that the perfitnes of the Lawe should be tryed and condemned by the offence of the giltye: that the truth of Christe should depend vpon the workes of sinners, that eternall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen should be valued by fading earth, that the most perfite iustice and equitye of the most glorious God, should be measured &amp; esteemed by the frailtye of corruptible flesh &amp; bloud. And therfore as we do not and dare not presume to confirme the certainty of our doctrine by our good deedes be they neuer so perfite, but rather confirme oure good deedes to be good by our doctrine: so should oure aduersaryes deale vprightly with vs, not to condemne our doctrine by our euil deedes, but rather condemne our euill deedes by our doctrine, which beinge pure and perfite shal condemne both our wickednes and theyrs, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theyr wicked and detestable doctrine.</p>
            <p>God forbid that the tryall of true religion should lye eyther vpon oure vprighte conuersation or theirs, least if it laye in mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection both the Iewe and the Turke mighte eyther of them soner boast of it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eyther of vs. The wysedome of God hath not so buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Church vpon sande. If it were founded vpon the workes of man, then should his Church neuer stand neyther by them nor by vs. We are but feeble and windshaken pillers vnable to vnderprop and beare such a waight, &amp; therfore how so euer they build theyr Church, we build not ours on our selues, but we build both it and our selues vpon that vnmoueable rocke Iesus Christe, and therefore how soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the winde and weather do shake vs and ouerthrowe vs throughe our owne weakenes, yet our foundation abydeth sure, and doth ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall nor flyt awaye but abydeth so for euer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may be still ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and set vp on the same againe.

Seing therefore this foundation wyll not last to vphold their Babilonicall buildinges against the assaultes of the Gospell, therefore now they will haue the tryall of doctrine to lye vpon the honesty of men, and herein they make the world beleeue that they haue a great aduauntage ouer vs.</p>
            <p>Seing they will needes driue vs to this plonge and seeke hereby to foyle vs and vtterlye to ouerthrow our foundation, we wil be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente herein also to ioyne issue with them, not as hauinge affiaunce in oure owne iustice (the Lorde amende that which is amisse in vs, and blessed be his name for those sparkes of his mercye that haue preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs from beinge worse then we are) but because we haue such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of their treacherye, and that we know none shalbe compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Antichriste in iniquitye. To set aside therefore all excusing of our selues in such matters as they do slaunder vs, and grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that we be as euill as they make vs, yet I dare bouldlye auouche that there hath not hetherto nor euer shall (I trust) proceede from vs such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable aboundance of corrupt fruite, as hath done from those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are the best, the most pure and perfits on theyr side, euen in those who they saye cannot erre, that are the most holye vicars of Christe vpon earth, namelye the holye fathers Popes &amp; bishops of Rome. Whose notorious villanyes from time to time swelled to the full and perfite measure of iniquitye, and so farre runne beyond our haynous sinnes,
<pb facs="tcp:711:9"/>
that supposing they dyed as they liued, I may bouldly warrant them this preferment, that if an hundreth of the rankest helhounds that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer raigned vpon the earth might be mustred out of hell, fourescore and nineteene of them should be Popes, perhaps for the last &amp; hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred place, eyther <hi>VVolsey</hi> or some other Cardinall would scuffle in among them.</p>
            <p>Whereof that thou mayest the better iudge (gentle Reader) I do here giue thee in this booke a little taste of theyr vnsauorye liues, I haue set them all forth here in one Pageante in such order as they played theyr Papall partes both Tragicall and Comicall for these Thousand yeares vpon this worldly stage: wherein I haue chosen rather to translate them as they were gathered in Latin by maister <hi>Bale</hi> most faithfullye, then to follow the parcial and flattering storye of <hi>Platina.</hi> In some places also I haue added diuers thinges out of sondrye authors, not as thoughe I desired to make perfite in all pointes that which maister <hi>Bale</hi> omitted: but because in conferringe his alleaging of storyes, I found manye thinges that without anye combraunce might be added and were worth the mentioning, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sixt booke of this historye out of one <hi>Theodoricus</hi> of <hi>Nyem</hi> Secretarye to Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the sixt, and wrote that which he sawe of that myserable and longe sciesme that set all the world together by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cares the space of xxxix. yeares, betweene <hi>Vrban</hi> the sixte, <hi>Clement</hi> the seuenth, <hi>Boniface</hi> the ix, <hi>Benedict</hi> the xiii. otherwyse called <hi>Iohn Moone,</hi> and other: which booke I am sure maister <hi>Bale</hi> neuer saw, for he would neuer haue omitted such notable and straunge matters as are contayned in it, and are here partlye touched by mee.</p>
            <p>Also for so much as these prelates do falsely colour al their pra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cks vnder the authoritye of S.

But because of the sodaine finishing of this worke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hande, I am forced in this Preface to leaue out many matters which I thought to haue vttered, which I could neuer finde conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niente leasure to be setled in one certaine place, in suche wyse as I might apply my selfe to write that which I purposed since this was finished and came to the hande of the Printer.

For such a meete Patrone was to be sought for, who by his wit, doctrine and learning, should be able to maintaine a desperate cause, and receiue into his tuition as it were an Orphane counted giltye and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the preiudicate opinion of all men, least it being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate and berefte of all good mens ayde hauing no tutour left vnto it, should together with his father haue his dying daye. After I had longe debated this with with my selfe and had vewed all men rounde about with an especial and diligent care: you iiii. most excellent prelates of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church came first to my reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance in whose ayde I might safely repose

my selfe that haue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times traueiled in this matter, by longe experience haue found out and beaten downe the assaultes and strokes of oure aduersaryes.

Uerelye I am not ignoraunt that anye one of you is man good enoughe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter any in this deuine combate. And I freelye confesse that this my litle worke is vnworthy to be dedicated euen vnto anye one of you: yet notwithstanding I do not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what you are able to do, but what I ought to do: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I esteeme the price of the gift, but I regard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most feruent zeale towards you all.

These maye worthelye be called the starres remayning on the right hand of Christe <hi>Apocal.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>The second contayneth the Mitred Archbishops &amp; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarckes from <hi>Siluester</hi> the first vnto <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, who althoughe they were not the wickedst and corruptest, yet with their traditions and humaine constitutions haue made a plaine waye to Antichriste.

            <p>To conclude I haue disposed the whole historye in such sort that I haue compared all the Romaine bishops to the 4. horses in the Reuelation of S. Iohn. The godlye and auncient fathers to the white horse: The archbishops and the Patriarckes to the red: The Popes &amp; the Antichristes vnto <hi>Siluester</hi> the seconde to the blacke, and from him to <hi>Iulius</hi> the seconde and all his companye of monkes, fryers and massemongers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which with al their power &amp; strength did defend the Popes kingdome, I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pale horse. I haue propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded this marke and methode in my booke, in the which I haue chalenged nothing to my selfe, but my labour in gathering, describing &amp; destributi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. For I knowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great part of this worke hath bin set forth by others, as by <hi>Damasus, Carsulanus, Platina Stella, Vuice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and others, but ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times dissemblingly and obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, somtimes falsly to please mens eares. To conclude, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye manye most dilligent &amp; faithfull wryters of our time: whom when I had perused with continuall reading I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb facs="tcp:711:12"/>
togither the dispersed and disagreeing members to one body, that those thinges which were scattered abroade in many places, and were therefore the harder to be founde out of the Readers, might the easier be searched out being gathered together into one booke, and layde out before all mens eyes, the which I rather were performed of any man then of me, and I had rather taken in hand my contry mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then foraine busines, bicause I haue spent my time in vayne. But I would not haue stirred vp this hudge puddel of the Romaine historie, the which twoe <hi>Hercules</hi> were not able to clime.</p>
            <p>But hearken what occasion inforced me therto, chiefly the exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my frends did draw me into this matter, otherwise I refused it, bicause my other worke in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe tongue, being proper only to English men, &amp; knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to very fewe, did seeme to do small profite to straungers. But this being ioyned to it, might be a publike commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and profitable to the vse of all men, and more prouided for in other matters. After this I went to it with a good courage, and although I did desire that other men whiche were more fit for this matter, and more garnished with elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, should take this matter in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Yet I thought that an accompt should be made of my talent, and that I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to stumble a little then that so great wickednes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriste, so great crueltie and inordinate pleasure more and more breaking out, and filling all thinges with the stinke therof, being omitted of all men, should seeme to be detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fewe or none.</p>
            <p>And if I should seeme to any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speake to frely, let him thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it doth not procede of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heat of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but through the knowledge of my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which do not declare things heard or redde only, but things knowen by experience, who liued. 24. yeares in that secte, and was present among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being no small souldiour of the Pope: where what is it that I haue not seene, what that I haue not heard, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:711:13"/>
is vnworthy of Christ, Christians, monkes, and also of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from whose superstitions at that time I was not free, but I vtterly abhorred their filthines and mischiefe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I perceiued many thinges whiche did offend, therefore I am nowe compelled to be more diligent in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them out, and more sharpe in reprouing them, seeing they do not repent. But sithe these thinges be done &amp; haue biene done of this flocke in Italy, Sicil, Spayne, Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and Englande, who doubteth that sheepe will not followe the shepehearde, or rather hogges their swyneheard, shall we not knowe the father by the childe, or the Lion by his talentes? when prysons be full of mischiefe, shall we thinke that the Romaine court hath none? many things haue bene hidden in darkenesse &amp; priuie places, the which the Sunne hath not seene, but tyme the mother of truthe. The mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries being put down in England, hath learned to speake and to bewraye them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for example, the registers of the kinges visitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or as they call it, the abbrigeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of things knowen by experience in the very congregation &amp; colleges of the Papistes, the which things I sawe them to my great feare and terrour, but nowe I possesse them, and kepe them to their great ignominie and shame, and haue opened a few of them hereafter, in the Epistle to the Reader. If <hi>Ezechiel</hi> now should pearce through the wall, and should be brought into their entries, halles, and darke chambers, he shoulde not see the Israelites bewayle <hi>Thamnum,</hi> but gelded me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnmaried, worthy to be woundred at, for the godly profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, offring their sacrifice to <hi>Baalpeor, Bacchus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Venus.</hi> And sithe I knowe these thinges to be certayne and true, should I not ouerthrowe them, should I not make them manifest and openly knowen to all the worlde? Truly they will saye that an Englishe man, whiche is separated from all other nations, dothe certainly knowe what is done at Rome in the secret chambers of the Pope and his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Shall not I openlye declare for a truth those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb facs="tcp:711:13"/>
whiche are declared in Bookes, and seene wyth the eyes of the wryter, the whiche thinges not the secrete chambers, but the princely court, not the priuie corners, but the open streetes, do euidently shew, but they deny it not, and yet defende it wyth moste wicked Bookes set foorth in their owne tongue, the which Christian shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes forbiddeth me to declare. The truth therfore ought to be expressed, and not couered with visard and disguising, but set foorth in his owne kinde, not darkened with cloke or sayle cloth, but decked finely in his owne collours: for they be grosse thinges and may be groped at with handes. But so great is the blindnesse of man, that at noone daye he can not see, and in the clearest Sunne his eyes be darkened.</p>
            <p>This our miserable Realme of Englande may be vnto vs a familiar example, for whose sake more willinglye I toke in hande to write this booke, that oure Englishe men may see now at the last what a terrible beast they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued into theyr common wealth, what a viper they che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe in their bosome, whose hissinge before they could not wel abide, do now suffer themselues to be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ong with their tributes, to be bitten with their leuying and takinge vp of money, &amp; to be entoxicated with their idolatrous poyson. Unto whom so many kinges, so manye noble men, did not once obeye: whom <hi>VVickliffe</hi> the moste godliest of hys time did openlye shewe in writing to be Antichrist. Whom K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eyght banished, whom <hi>Edward</hi> the vi. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> most godlye king cast forth, together with all the reliques and dregs of their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Him Queene Mary receyued being thrust in by Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> many men litle regarding it, manye winking at it as though they saw it not: euery man almost allowinge it, or at the least with diuers affections filthily reioysing in it. It greeueth mee for my countrey sake, because they offend God so greatly in forsaking him, and in violatinge the oath which they made before to theyr kinges: so that now they are compelled to obey at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> becke
<pb facs="tcp:711:14"/>
to the newe monstrous &amp; cruell gouernment of most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Antichriste, vnder whom they haue deserued to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with an idolatrous yoke, to be blinded wyth super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and deuilish Poperye, and with a smal assault of the ennemyes to be shamefullye ouercome. The which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding while Gods Religion flourished, and Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye wythered and was wasted away, was neyther aflicted with the hand of God, neither assaulted with any external power, but if it were assaulted, yet at no time coulde they conquere it. I speake these things (most reuerent fathers) to my greate griefe, and so much the more, because I iudge the contempte of the word of God, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gulfe of Romaine filthines to be the cause of the plagues, and that Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge troden downe, we had rather that the Pope (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> witch and <hi>Circes</hi> of the whole worlde, not the seruaunt of all ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes but the Lorde of all Lords, not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Uicar of Christe but the minister of the deuill) should treade and skip vpon our shoulders and neckes, then we would embrace &amp; kisse the sweete yoke, the lighte burden and most pleasant crosse of oure Sauiour Iesus Christe. And I require this at your handes (most godlye fathers) that you will thincke this present calamity to be no small cause which stirred me vp to this matter, and I desire for the great mercye of our Sauiour Christe, that you go forwarde in that worke that you haue in hand, and that you will make your prayers for England, (that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not pray for it selfe) that this Pope may be exempted out of the minds of all Christians, Italians, Spaniardes, Frenchmen and Englishmen, thruste out of all kingdomes and Churches, broken in two and vtterlye destroyed. Praye that the blind maye see, the deafe heare, and that those which be in darcknes and in the shadowe of death, maye come to the light and knowledge of the truth. For your prayers shal be of more effect with God, than all the blessinges and cursinges of the detestable Pope.</p>
            <p>By these thinges I trust that you vnderstande what I
<pb facs="tcp:711:14"/>
haue taken in hande, and for what cause. First the desire of my freindes compelled mee thereunto. Secondly my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science pricked mee forward hasting hereunto, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I mighte communicate these thinges which I haue both heard and seene in the whole course of my life. Last of all, the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table state of Englande called mee hereunto, that for the loue which I beare to my brethren I would ayde it, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaine tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nye being read &amp; knowne, and the ofspring of all the Popes, they might seeke a newe way and amende their liues. Also to restore the dignitye of the common wealth which was lost, and to the reforminge of the Church, and to the glorye of Iesus Christe the onely gouernour of the earth.</p>
            <p>But not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out great cause do I dedicate this my booke vnto you which are in this our age y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest defendours of the Christian fayth, which also do beare this greuous &amp; odious burden, and for that cause do burne with the same fire of enuye which I do. For truly I speake as I thincke &amp; as I beleiue, &amp; because I beleiue it I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not hold my peace: If at <hi>VVite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berg Luther</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vpholder of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christian fayth, at <hi>Tigur Zuinglius</hi> the inuincible defendour of the pure veritye, and a professour therof vnto the death, at <hi>Basil Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius</hi> a lighte and lampe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house of God had not opened the liuelye springes of the Scripture, and being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened had not defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them against the boldnes of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>listines,</hi> if others in those dayes in your places had not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayned this oure Religion, if you would not haue put to your ayde and helping hands, if God had not left the seede of the truth in those Churches wherin you are Preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, there had bin no place for Christe on the earth where hee might put his head, ther should haue bin no refuge for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles to flye vnto, Christian pietye shoulde finde no place in which it might be confirmed &amp; safelye established. And all those things that I haue shewed here, were taught me of your pastours and writers. Therefore it is meete that I
<pb facs="tcp:711:15"/>
should render some part thereof with gaine from whence I had it, neyther do I honour &amp; worship onely your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as the springes of pure Religion, the which with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye passages doth flow vnto all the corners of the earth, &amp; euen to vs beyonde the Ocean, but all Englishe peregrins are bounde of dutye vnto you, for your great benefites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vppon them. The which thing I would haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed at large in the name of all my freindes, if I had not written vnto you to whom we are of dutye bound: yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to passe all thinges in silence and declare none of them I cannot. Therefore I praye you pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mee, and let your modestye and gentlenes giue place and pardon mine affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of so many I declare a fewe, to the intent that other men may vnderstand if I had not a iust cause to dedicate this my booke to you before al other. The which thinge while I shewe briefelye as time and order doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, so I will name euery one of you not respecting your dignitye, but doing after the imbecillitye of memorye, and the perspicuitye of the matter.</p>
            <p>Therefore that I maye declare from the beginninge, &amp; ascende from the farthest vnto the nighest, whereto much duty owe we to <hi>VVitenberg</hi> that most fayre marchandize of all artes, they euidently declare which go thither either to behold the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, or to giue themselues to studye, with whose notable prayses many being styrred vppe would go thither in great companies, if riches would abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as their good will doth to go so longe a iourneye. For when they prayse other learned, not withoute gratefull testifyinge of many benefites towardes them. Than (O <hi>Philip</hi>) they do declare thy singuler curtesye, maruelous facilitye, and thy good wil alwayes ready to deserue wel of al men. Neither without a cause. For thou prosecutest al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at home with all kinde of humanitye, and at home with thy preaching &amp; louing letters doest ease the sorrowful &amp; wauering minds. For it is not vnknowen what thou hast done at the councel
<pb facs="tcp:711:15"/>
of <hi>VVesalia</hi> in the Englishe mens behalfe, who when thou sawest to take paynes for Religion sake, and to be greatly moued wyth the vniust outcryes of men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> helde opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thou thoughtest good y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the cause should be heard wythout debate or strife, and not to be put oute with crye &amp; clapping of hands: thou saydst that the men were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned and relieued, and not to be vexed and afflicted with any sharpe iudgement. To this ende thou didst write to the maiestrates of <hi>Franckford,</hi> so that by thy letters which I chaunced to see, I am certified where thou didst thincke it meete that our men purelye thinkinge of the articles of our Christian fayth, and in diuers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersyes defending their opinion with feruour of zeale accordinge to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be taughte and not to be oppressed, to be warned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> talke not troubled with force, sith that doubtfull matters ought to be handled of the aduersaryes parte wyth obscure wordes.

            <p>But leuing <hi>VVittenberge,</hi> I come to <hi>Basile,</hi> where I will be more parciall, not bicause I can not prayse him suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inough, but bicause I am one of them which haue felt and do daily feele the great beneuolence of the Senate, ministers, and the whole people, least I should not seeme to be so gratefull a prayser as a deceitfull flatterer. Therfore I will saye nothing of thee at this tyme, moste wyse &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Sulcer,</hi> nothinge of <hi>M.

Iohn Brandmiller,</hi> and other ministers of Gods word, whose beneuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is daily seene. I omitte the griefes which you moste willingly suffered, not without great paines and trauayle. But this onely I will saye, that although the good will of the people and magistrate was sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, of them selues toward, yet it did seeme to arise and spring for the moste part through your sermons, so that whatsoeuer beneuolence happened vnto vs at that tyme, was through your request and impulsion. But here (as I sayde before) I desire breuitie, bicause I am one of them which haue experience of you. I will speake more of <hi>Tigur</hi> and <hi>Geneua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Tigur</hi> alwayes being a safegard to such as flye fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their countreyes, and a moste excellent vniuersitie of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuines, and a moste renoumed schole, doth open vnto me a large fielde, in which this my oration may walke and haue his full course.</p>
            <p>Whether I haue respect vnto, the common profite of al nations, or that, that is only proper to England, for what a notable oracle there is as it were for all Christendome, what a notable quire of most learned men. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may say nothing of thee O <hi>Bullinger,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so many notable bookes compiled with such singular pietie and manifold learning, with suche varietie of all thinges, and sentences of auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t writers decked as it were with starres, doth praise enough to the Catholike church, although I holde my peace. But that I may omitte al the other which were borne and bread at <hi>Tygur,</hi> As <hi>Bibliander</hi> and <hi>Hippius,</hi> whiche knewe all thinges, <hi>Radulph Gualther,</hi> the eloquent preacher and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litik writer <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>radus Gesnerus,</hi> a notable library as it were of all disciplines, and my singuler friend, <hi>Iosias Simler,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Vuolphius,</hi> most learned men also, &amp; my very friends with many other notable professors of other artes: Good Lorde, what notable olde men were those learned straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>M.

<pb facs="tcp:711:16"/>
you receiued into your citie? One of the whiche if some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should haue, they should seeme to be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and enriched with a great treasure and orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py was Englande when she possessed them, miserable whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she lost them: of this congregation sithe thou art president most learned <hi>Bullinger,</hi> I haue iustly chosen thee to be my patrone, with whose authoritie the Romaine court may be weakened, and my discription be established. Who if thou wouldest call into the fielde, these noble captaines, stoute souldious with their furnished bandes, with a reasonable power thou shalt ouercome, at the first one onset the whole troupes and bondes of the Papistes. But I will omitte these thinges, as common and knowen to all men, what he hath done to our Englishe men at <hi>Tigur,</hi> seeing that is proper to my purpose, and not the other, I will here leue that, and touch this but briefly. For when I was with you and had tasted thy hospitalitie O <hi>Bulli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger,</hi> &amp; the humanitie of others, I vnderstode the great good will you did beare to our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tremen which were with you. That worthy man <hi>Iohn Parckhurst,</hi> and worthy of a better fortune, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to me howe much bounde he was to thee, to <hi>M. Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and to the whole citie. It was tolde me also of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were at <hi>Basill</hi> with me, of thy care and fatherly affection toward them, whyle they liued with you together in one house, euen vnder the shadowe of your citie, being defended from all persecution, with the great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent and loue of your citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Also the incredible liberalitie of your magistrates, the which frely gaue vnto them corne and wine sufficient to susteine .xiii. or .xiiii. men, and when they refused to take it, they were sory that they hadde not oportunitie to pleasure them.</p>
            <p>But nowe I haste to <hi>Geneua,</hi> of which if I should make any long oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when I had saide all, I should seeme scarce to haue declared halfe that whiche might be saide. In the which I greatly marueile at the notable prouidence of our
<pb facs="tcp:711:17"/>
God, which so stirred vp the mindes of the citizens and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, that they were not afrayde to receiue so many thousand straungers into the suburbes of one citie. Againe, did so turne the heartes of the straungers, that although they were more in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, &amp; the superiours, yet woulde sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte them selues vnder their power, as though they were the inferiours, in so muche that they did not acknowledge them selues to be Lordes and citizens, but priuate men and straungers. Let other men fayne other miracles, but <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua</hi> seemeth to me to be the wonderfull miracle of the whole worlde: so many from all countries come thether, as it were vnto a sanctuary, not to gather riches but to liue in pouertie: not to be satisfied, but to be hungry, not to liue pleasauntly, but to liue miserably, not to saue their goodes, but to leese them. Many marchantes do rushe thether for gaynes, souldiours for spoyles, all for their owne profitte. But it seemeth to be a monsterous and a wonderfull mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that men should flye to scarcenes from plenteousnes, to trauaile fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ease, from plenteousnes of ryches, to miserable pouertie, <hi>Lutetia, London, Franckfort,</hi> are newe markets for marchandize, vnto the which men come, not for gaine, not for marchandise, not for tauerning, to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge heauenly thinges w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> earthly things, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in steede of humane treasures, they may gather heauenly treasures in heauen. We haue read that consuls haue bin taken from the plough to beare rule, but from florishinge fortune, from great riches and dignities to the plough, to great labours and trauayle, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an horse to an asse weeting and knowing it, is it not a great marueile? Is it not wonderfull that Spanyardes, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Scottes, Englishemen, Frenchemen, Germaines, disagreeing in manners, speache and apparell, sheepe and wolues, bulles and beares, being coupled with the onely yoke of Christe, should liue so louingly and friendly, and that Monkes, Laymen, and Nunnes, disagreeing both in life and secte should dwell together, like a spirituall and
<pb facs="tcp:711:17"/>
Christian congregation? vsing one order, one cloyster, and like ceremonies. Is it not wonderfull that so many stoute enemies hanging ouer them, and looking still to deuoure them, as Sathan and the Pope their moste bitter enemies, they should not onely be safe, but also liue so long time in quietnes? Thankes be therfore vnto God, because he hath appointed the pastour of his scattered and dispersed flocke, the captaine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vanished, to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miserable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with whose counsell gouernment &amp; wisdome, so great a congregation of people, being not only diuerse, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another, hath bene nourished together vnder one bande of loue, so that nowe nothing is more louing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those enemies, nothing more like, then their vnlikenes, no body more happy, then these miserable men. I thanke thee in this my writing in the name of them all, because when they would purely honoure God in their owne countrey, &amp; can not, it may be lawefull for them to come to the churche and celebrate the congregation, in the which they may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call vpon their God, sincerely administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and may fulfill other rites as they were citizens, with the priuiledge, and highe fauour of the magistrates. Happy is that people who enioyeth these thinges, and haue so worthy a bishop, which gathereth together y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dispersed, comforteth the broken in heart, fauoureth exiles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the weake with example and doctrine.</p>
            <p>But perchaunce I may seeme, to haue sayde to much to you and to you all, most gentle fathers, who are troubled with grauer matters, and haue no leysure to reade your prayses. And indued with suche modestie, that you will scarse attende vnto it. But beare with me while I doe but my dutie, for I prayse not you but the giftes of God that are of you, and commende the happy state of your churches vnto the faythful, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may learne to giue thankes and to imitate you.

               </q>
There is yet a thirde matter vvhich forced mee herevnto, and hauing seene and heard these thinges vehemently moued me to vvrite. This is the precepte of Christe in the xviij. Chapter of the Reuelation of S. Iohn: For a voyce came from heauen from the right hand of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the euerlasting throne of Christe, vvith a great voyce soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our eares saying. Go from her my people lest ye be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of her vvickednes, and ye receiue part of her punishment. For her sinnes are gone vp to heauen, and God hath remembred her vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes.
<pb facs="tcp:711:20"/>
And then commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t follovveth vvhich vvas giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the beast vvith seuen heades. Revvard her euen as she hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarded you, and giue her double according to her vvorks, and poure in double to her in the same cup vvhich she filled vnto you. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as she glorified her selfe and liued vvantonly, so much poure you into her of punishment and sorrovve. This is the vvorde of the Lorde declared vnto vs as vvell here as in the fiftye Chap. of Ieremy. That this serpent might perish &amp; all his doinges brought to nought. Yet for al this I do vvel reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the sayings of S. Paule, that al Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to be honoured although they be vvicked and vnprofitable for a common vvealth, because they be placed there of God, neither to speake euill of them beinge but vvotmes, dust and ashes, Neither dare I murmur against the prouidence of God, vvhich is contrary to his holy vvorde. Therefore from the bottome of my hart I beseech our Lorde and Redeemer Iesus Christe, that he vvould haue mercye vppon all Kinges, Princes and Nations, and so prouide that all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons maye be so gouerned as is most tending to his glory: For vvhose reueng he hath most stoutly fortifyed mee vp in this my old age. Not studying to derogate or take avvaye the honour from anye Christian Kinge, but onely to inuey against the Romishe beast, the Synagog of Sathan, and most vvicked Antichrist, vvith the vvritings and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monye of most learned men.</p>
            <p>If I shal haue said any thing sharper then thou didst loke for (most gentle Reader) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider I pray you the hudge tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny of this most vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Viper of the vvorld, vvhose destruction accordinge to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises is at hande. Great Babilon shall fall vvhich hath seduced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations, and shall be destroyed the vvhole vvorlde marueylinge thereat. If the vehemencye of my stile shall offende thee, beholde the maruelous force of the holye ghoste in the Prophete Dauid and most holy king, vvho in the Lordes cause most stoutlye saide: I haue hated the congregation of the vvicked, Psal. 25. He promiseth also aftervvarde by his Prophetes, that he vvoulde destroye the brothell houses and vvicked places. Ezechi. 16. I vvill shevve fayth the Lord vnto all Nations thy nakednes, and to al kingdomes thy shame Nahum. 3. Thy dishonour and filthines shall be opened, and thy reproche shall be seene, I vvill be reuenged, and none shall resiste mee, Esay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 47. VVoe be vnto those Kinges as manye as haue vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the beast or haue ayded her, or haue receiued helpe of her, or haue committed fornication vvith her, as many as haue serued her, and haue ioyned handes against the Lambe, and vvaged battell for
<pb facs="tcp:711:20"/>
her cause, because their names are not vvritten in the booke of lyfe from the beginninge of the vvorlde. And the Lambe shal ouercome them at the last like a Lorde of Lordes, and kinge of kinges, and they shall go together vvith the beast to destruction and vtter dampnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Apocalips 17. GOD therefore giue in the hartes of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vvhom the x. hornes do shadovve, that they maye faithfully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this his vvill and iudgement, that they maye make her deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and leaue her naked, that they maye eate her fleshe and burne her in fire, that is, let her abide her last punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the sheding of the innocent bloud, of so manye faithfull Christians. Be it done, Be it done. Amen.</p>

                        <hi>Ieseph. anti. lib.</hi> 19. <hi>cap.</hi> 7</note> died afterwarde at <hi>Cesarea,</hi> stricken by Gods Angell: who being as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, released out of pryson, and made king there by <hi>Caligula</hi> raigned in all seuen yeares:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caligula</hi> would haue restored this <hi>Agrippa</hi> to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioseph. Anti. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</note> as sone as he him self came to the Empier, euen the same daye that the solemnitie was kept for the buriall of his predecessour <hi>Tiberius.</hi> But (saith <hi>Iosephus</hi>) <hi>Antonia</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:711:25"/>
the wyfe of <hi>Caligula,</hi> gaue him counsell that he should noe do so, but pause a while longer, not because she was loth that <hi>Agrippa</hi> should be at libertie, but because the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by deliuering of him so spedely, should be thought that he did it in despite of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who had committed him to pryson, and therefore it was deferred for a season, &amp; at length he was deliuered: then the next yeare <hi>Agrippa</hi> craued leaue of <hi>Caligula</hi> to go into <hi>Iudaea</hi> to his kingdom, whiche was graunted him. So that by this computation it may easely appeare, that whereas <hi>Agrippa</hi> (as <hi>Ioseph</hi> sayth) died in the seuenth yeare of his raigne, this seuenth yeare doth arise to the fourth yeare of <hi>Claudius,</hi> who did next succede <hi>Caligula.</hi> Thus it is apparent that <hi>Herode</hi> or <hi>Agrippa</hi> as <hi>Ioseph</hi> calleth him, died in the 46. yeare of the incarnation, and that the same yeare Peter was prisoner at Hierusalem as is saide before, and not byshop at Rome.</p>
                  <p>Another reason to proue that it should be this yere, may be this: <hi>S. Luke</hi> in the xii. chapter of the Actes saith, that this <hi>Herode</hi> had conceiued displeasure against the <hi>Tirians</hi> and <hi>Sidonians,</hi> whiche was the cause, that after the same Easter that Peter was imprisoned, he went downe from <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> whether the <hi>Tirians</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> came vnto him, and by the intercession of <hi>Blastus</hi> the kinges chamberlaine they sued for peace at his hande, because (saith <hi>Luke</hi>) in the 20. verse of the 12. chapter of the Actes, their contrey was nourished by the kinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: signifiyng that the prouision of king <hi>Agrippa</hi> ayded their necessitie in the time of the famine being then. This dearth &amp; famin is that, wherof <hi>Agabus</hi> the prophet did pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phecy at <hi>Antioch,</hi> which saith <hi>Luke</hi> Actes the xi. came to passe in the raigne of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and as other authours haue noted it was in the fourth yere of <hi>Claudius,</hi> so saith <hi>Vsper gensis</hi>: Thus we se that yet to this fourth yere of <hi>Claudius</hi> by whiche time at the vttermost Peter should not only be at Rome, but begin his regiment ouer the churche, he is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:711:25"/>
yet at Hierusalem, which is 1600. miles from Rome: But because that <hi>Luke</hi> saith, after that he was deliuered by the Angell out of pryson, and after that he had signified his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery to Mary, he conuayed him selfe away from thence. I will procede to examine, whether he went not now from Hierusalem to Rome, and therfore go to the twoo yeares that ensued next.</p>

                     <hi>ANno domini</hi> 49. Peter was at Hierusalem: for this yeare the counsell was held at Hierusalem: mencioned in the xv. of the Actes. At whiche synode Peter was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and made an oration as is shewed in the vii. verse of the said chapter. But nowe it remaineth to be proued, that this Synode was at this tyme: for proofe hereof Saint Paule speaking of his comming to this counsell in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde chapiter to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> saythe: Then after 14. yeares I came agayne vp to Hierusalem, and <hi>Barnabas</hi> with me &amp;c. by the reste that foloweth it is euident that Paule signified his comming to this counsell, and not any other time of his repairing to Hierusalem: and so also doth <hi>S.

                  <p>But here it may be fayde, that <hi>S.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider all these iourneies with other circumstances, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time, and distance of place, and Paules abiding in euery place to preache diligently, and then iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the forsayde synode could be held this same yeare that Paule came to <hi>Athens</hi>: Waying also that many more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cities are in these cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treies <hi>Galacia, Mysia, Phrigia,</hi> and the rest, visited by Paule but not spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of in the Actes: Againe considering that the Apostle traueled by lande all moste altogether &amp; that by leasurable iourneyes on foote, he could not finishe thousandes of miles in short time, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it were very harde for him to come to <hi>Athens</hi> the same yere. Beside al this if it were to be vnderstode as <hi>Hierome</hi> maketh it, then if ye accompt it in the table, ye shall finde it to be one yeare further, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the yeare 52. and it is plaine to be more vntrue, for then by this time Paule had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a yeare in <hi>Corinthe,</hi> and so had not bene in Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in two yeares before:</p>
                  <p>The conclusion therefore is, that the said counsell could not be holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to the accompte made by <hi>Hierome</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therfore S. Paules wordes must be vnderstoode as I sayde before, namely of fourtene yeares after his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: and then it is euident that Peter was yet in Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in the yeare 49.</p>
                  <p>But to procede: it may be demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, where Peter was from the time of his deliuery out of pryson at Hierusalem to the time of this synode: that is from the fourth yeare of <hi>Claudius</hi> to the seuenth yere of his raigne. Perhaps Peter went to Rome at some time betwene those yeares. <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:711:27"/>
sayth, that in the fifth yere of <hi>Claudius</hi> Peter was at Hierusalem,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nicepho. li.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</note> at the death of the virgin Mary. But if we weigh diligently the history of the scripture, conferring one place with an other, it shall appeare that although it be not specified in the actes, yet Peter was at <hi>Antioche</hi> in this time. For Paule in the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the <hi>Gallathians</hi> saith, that Peter came to <hi>Antioche,</hi> whiche could not be at anye time before this time of his deliuery out of pryson as may appeare by the former part of this discourse. Againe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse reasons there are, whiche moue me to thinke that it was before the tyme of this counsell: for first Peter being at <hi>Antioche</hi> Paule sayth of him self, that he reproued Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euen to his face, because that he did eate with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, till certaine came from Iames from Hierusalem, and then Peter being afrayde to offende those circumcised, did shrinke away from the Gentils. And the rest of the Iewes yea and <hi>Barnabas</hi> also fell into the same dissimulation with them. This dissembling of Peter is one reason to proue that it was before the counsell, for it semed to Peter a doubtfull matter, whether he might be conuersaunt with the Gentils, whiche if it had bene as it was afterwarde by the counsell determined, that circumcision was not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, then had Peter bene out of doubt what to do therein, and would haue delt plainely according to the truth which he had knowen manifestly: Agayne if it had bene after the counsell, the matter being discussed and agreed vpon, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter should not haue had any cause to dissemble for feare of offending them in that point, that came from Iames: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neded he to haue mistrusted that they would mislike of that, whiche should haue bene allowed by the churche: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would Peter haue regarded more their vniust offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, then the decre of the counsell. Last of all in the beginning of the 15. of the Actes <hi>Luke</hi> maketh mencion of suche that came from Hierusalem and troubled the churche at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche</hi> about circumcision, and howe Paule and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:711:27"/>
stoode against them, and hereupon ensued the said counsell. And thus it appeareth that Peter was at <hi>Antioch</hi> at this time, and hetherto therfore to the yeare of the incarnacion 49 he came not within a thousand miles of Rome.</p>

                  <p>And as for the former yeare by their owne stories it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to be the time of his comming, for at his first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Simon Magus</hi> as <hi>Platina</hi> reportes, was in suche ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at Rome through the admiration of his sorcery, that he was honoured as a God: for a piller was set vp betwene two bridges, whereupon it was written, <hi>Simoni sancto Deo,</hi> To <hi>Simon</hi> the holy God: so that Peter had a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict ere he could roote out the credit of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and plant the Gospell and Iesus Christe in the hartes of the Romaines, whiche by the testimony of <hi>Platina</hi> he did so effectually ere he left, that in the ende <hi>Simon Magus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to contempt, <hi>Simon Peter</hi> was reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced and honoured almoste like a God.

                  <p>Concerning these former two yeares this may be sayde briefely. <hi>Platina</hi> and the rest of the Romaine registers doe auoutche that Peter after he left Hierusalem, went to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tioche</hi> and continued there byshop seuen yeares, or as some other thinke fiue yeares at the least, or he came to Rome.

                  <p>TOuching the last yeare of these that is the yeare 54. and the twelth yeare of <hi>Claudius,</hi> it is euident that Peter was not bishop at Rome, for then Paule wrote his epistle thether to the Romains, in the sixtenth chapter wherof he endeth his epistle with particular salutacions to xviii. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones by name, beside priuate housholdes: and amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g those xviii. eight or nine were women, and yet there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of Peter, surely if Peter had gone thether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wryting of this epistle, so that Paule might haue then thought that he had bene there, Paule would not so haue neglected the worthy Apostle among the rest, onlesse he should seme to make lesse accompt of him in the churche then of women: if therfore the epistle were nowe written it is probable, Peter was not nowe at Rome. But it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent inough that the epistle was written at this time. Paule in the xv. chapter and the 24 verse to the Romains promiseth that he would come to Rome, but excuseth him selfe that hee came not presently, for nowe (saieth he) I am going to Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so that hereby it semeth to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his iourney at some time going to Hierusalem. But it is nedefull to consider at what time especially this was because he went thether fiue seueral times as it appeareth, first in the ninth, secondly in the twelfth, thirdly in the xv. fourthly in the xviii. fiftly and last that is mencioned in scripture in the xxi. chapter of the Actes. And touching the first three times, it could not be at any of those voiages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Paule had not yet met with Timothe, for he founde him not as it is shewed in the sixtenth of the actes, til after his thirde comming from Hierusalem, from the synode: but at the writing of this epistle <hi>Timothie</hi> was in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <hi>Roman.</hi> 16.</note> Then of those two ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings after his acquaintaunce with Timothie, it is plaine that it could not be that he wrote it at the first time men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned in the 18 of the Actes, for in the 18. verse of the same chapter, ere Paule returned to Hierusalem it is saide that he departed from <hi>Corinthe</hi> to <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila,</hi> went with him to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where he left them and would not stay being thereto requested, because he hasted to Hierusalem, whether he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t immediatly: At this ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Hierusalem, this epistle semeth not to be written, because in the 16. chapiter thereof he sendeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> who were with him in the moste part of this iourney,<note place="margin">

But if any make this obiection, that because of these salutacions to <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> this epistle might be written before they came from Rome, at some time of Paules going to Hierusalem, this is aunswered with that whiche I haue noted before, that it could not be so, because Paule was not then acquainted with Timothie, with whome he met but euen lately before he came to <hi>Corinthe,</hi> and went not to Hierusalem, from the time that he founde Timothie till nowe, that he left <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> at <hi>Ephesus</hi>: the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion therefore is, that this epistle was written to Rome at the last time that Paule went vp to Hierusalem, and by that time might <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> he retourned to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: Beside all this, in the 19. of the Actes &amp; the 20. verse, <hi>Luke</hi> sayth that Paule purposed through the spirite after he had walked through <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> to go to Hierusalem, saying: after I haue bene there I must go to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IN the seconde yeare of <hi>Nero,</hi> being the 58. yeare of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnacion, Paule came to Rome by the testimonie of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spergensis: In Nerone: &amp; Eusebius li.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. At which time it is euident that Peter was not byshop according to the Romaine bragge: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paule came to Rome, <hi>Luke</hi> being then with him saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 28.</note> that the brethren hearing of vs came forth to mete vs &amp;c. but there is no mention made of Peter, neither comming nor sending to Paule. The thirde daye after, Paule sent for the chiefe of the Iewes, reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them about the faith, who aunswered him thus. We will heare what thou doest thinke: for we knowe that this sect is spoken against euery where: When Paule had ended his sermon, the Iewes fell at variaunce about it, for some beleued, and some beleued not. This aunswere and doing of the Iewes sheweth, that they had heard but litle of Christe, till the comming of Paule: nothing so muche as they should haue heard and knowen, if Peter beinge (by faith and promise their peculier Apostle) had bene bishop in Rome these twelue yeares since the fourth of <hi>Claudius,</hi> or but at any time within these foure yeares since the epistle of Paule was sent to Rome. Neither can it be excused to saye, that he might be bishop, and yet not medle with prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to the Iewes, but exercise him selfe in conuerting the Gentiles, this excuse cannot take place, for if Peter had
<pb facs="tcp:711:30"/>
bene in Rome, he ought chiefly to haue conferred with the Iewes: for as Paule saith in the ninth verse of the seconde to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> that by promise Paule was appointed Apostle to the Gentiles, and Peter to the Iewes, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we se that Paule discharged his dutie in that point to the Gentiles, so is it to be thought, that Peter did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse to the circumsized, as partly appeareth by his firste epistle written namely to the dispersed Iewes in <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Capadocia, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> vnto the whiche thing <hi>Eusebius lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. thinketh he did wholly addict him selfe: And therfore it is not likely that Peter hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to had any suche prerogatiue in Rome as the Pope drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of.</p>

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 28.</note>IT appeareth that for these twoo yeares Peter came not yet to his dignitie, for Paule co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming prisoner to Rome, did continue there as <hi>Luke</hi> testifieth, twoo yeares, all the whiche time saieth <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> he liued by the labour of his handes, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.

                        <hi>Galat.</hi> 1</note> In the epistle to the <hi>Galathians</hi> Paule being compelled to confirme the authoritie of his doctrine and Apostleship, whiche some sought to deface, speaketh muche of former acquaintance betwene him and Peter, howe he came to Hierusalem, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. to se Peter: And howe he reproued him at <hi>Antioche &amp;c.</hi> And yet he maketh no mencion of his being with him at this time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when Peters testimony by subscripcion or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse might moste haue confirmed Paules cause, and haue testified his doctrine to be as autenticall, as that whiche the other Apostles taught. Whiche oportunitie if Paule
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:711:30"/>
should haue omitted, when it might both haue stoode hym in steede, and might best haue bene obtained, it should haue geuen greater occasion, to encrease the discredit &amp; mistrust of Paules function &amp; preaching: And this would the wise and carefull Apostle haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, who omitted no opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to the furtheraunce of the Gospell. &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>IN the yeare of thincarnation 60. Paule as is sayde, was prisoner at Rome, who for the tyme of his abode there, so planted the Gospell, that at his departing from thence he left great fruite therof, and suche in deede as if Peter had succeded Paule within two, thre, or foure yeres, and there supplied the roume of a byshop, <hi>Cornelius Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> speaking of the estate of the Christians in Rome about the yeare 67. being but seuen yeares after Paules depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, should not haue had cause so soone to saye as he doth, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by that tyme the Christian Religion was repressed: For <hi>Vspergensis</hi> saith, that in the 67. yere, <hi>Nero</hi> did set Rome on fier, of the whiche <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> writing, <hi>lib.</hi> 15. <hi>Augustae historiae,</hi> sayth: <hi>Ergo abole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do rumori Nero sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit reos. &amp;c. Therfore Nero (to stop the rumour of his setting the citie on fier) suborned giltie persons, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with strange punishment, those whome the vulgar people detesting for their wickednes, doth call Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. That mischeuous superstition being repressed till nowe, brake out againe, &amp;c. Therfore first they were taken that confessed it, afterward by their accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an houge multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, not so much for that they were gilty of fyreing the citie as for hatred, are condemned, and were put to death with great despite, some encased in the skinnes of wylde beastes, that they might bee torne in peces with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:711:31"/>
dogges, some crucified, some were burned to giue light in the night time. &amp;c.</hi> These are the woordes of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> notwithstanding, as it appeareth he was a blasphemer of the name of Christe. By these woordes of his it appeareth that nowe Christianitie began to reuiue, and that nowe it was quenched: which argueth plaine that from the former time of Paules departure til this time, Peter had not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in Rome the place of a preaching pastour and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bishop. And seing this broyle against the Christians, began now to be so hotte not in al places, but especially in Rome, howe could Peter sit quietly in this citie as bishop thereof and not be fyred out with his flocke: but they saye all that he lyued after this tyme about three yeares, for this was done in the eleuenth yeare of <hi>Nero,</hi> who raigned almoste xiiii. yeares, and Peter was martyred in the last yeare of <hi>Nero,</hi> as they saye all. If this reuiuing of the Gospel was by Peters meanes, why would <hi>Nero</hi> spare him being the head: if Peter escaped by flying, then he shewed him selfe to be an hierling and no true shepeherde that forsaketh his flocke when he seeth the wolfe come.</p>

                  <p>Nowe are we come to the latter tyme of <hi>Nero,</hi> in which yeres if Peter were not bishop of Rome, then is it certaine that he was not bishop there at all.

at this latter time, then was not Peter yet estalled in his Diocese, for if he had bene in Rome in his pontificall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, I thinke Paule should not haue bene dryuen to sende to <hi>Ephesus</hi> 1000. miles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome for <hi>Timothie</hi> to bryng <hi>Marke</hi> to come to minister to him.

                  <head>¶ The death of Peter.</head>
                  <p>TOuching the death of Peter all wryters do not agree as it is sufficiently declared in the Actes and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes fol. 56. in these wordes. They that folow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion and the Popes decrees saye that bothe Peter and Paule suffred both in one daye and one yeare, whiche opinion semeth to be taken out of <hi>Dionisius</hi> byshop of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthe. Hierome</hi> in his booke <hi>De viris illustr.</hi> affirmeth that they suffered both in one daye, but hee expresseth not the yeare, so doth <hi>Isiodorus</hi> and <hi>Eusebius. Prudentius</hi> in his <hi>Peristephano,</hi> noteth that they both were put to death vpon the same daye but not in the same yeare, &amp; saythe that Paule folowed Peter a yeare after. <hi>Abdias</hi> recordeth that Paule suffered twoo yeares after Peter. Moreouer if it be true whiche <hi>Abdias</hi> sayth, that after the crucifying of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Paule remayned in his free custody at Rome, mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the 28. of the Actes of the Apostles, whiche was as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> witnesseth, in the thirde or fourth yeare of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> then must it be tenne yeares betwixt the martyrdome
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:711:32"/>
of Peter and of Paule, for as muche as it is by all wryters confessed that Paule suffered in the xiiii. yeare, which was the last yeare of <hi>Nero. Vspergensis</hi> saithe that they were both executed in one yeare, but he noteth not that they died in one daye. <hi>Sabellicus</hi> sayth, both in one yeare &amp; one daye. Some say as <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that they died together both in one place. But <hi>Dionysius,</hi> saythe otherwyse, that the one bad thother farewel when they were parted asonder goyng to death. Againe, the moste writers saye that <hi>Nero</hi> was the cause therof: But <hi>Linus</hi> saith, <hi>Agrippa</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that Peter should be slayne, because that by his persuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foure of the concubines of <hi>Agrippa</hi> refused to liue any longer in suche vnchast life with the king, therefore for anger he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that Peter should be crucified. Finally <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> and <hi>Lyra,</hi> wryting vpon the 34. verse of the 22. chap. of <hi>Mathewe</hi>: say that Peter was put to death at Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Iewes, and that Christe prophecied thereof saying: <hi>Lo I sende you prophetes &amp;c. and some of them ye shall kyll.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many thinges might be added to disproue this dotage of Peters being bishop at Rome, but because I thinke this to be sufficient, I let passe diuers necessary thinges least I should be ouer tedious. But if any be desirous to se this matter more suffitiently handled, let him reade <hi>Vlrichus Velenus,</hi> wryting purposely of this in a litle booke called <hi>Demonstrationes contra Romani Papae primatus figme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Beside there hath bene of late set forth in Englishe a discours very learnedly and fully entreating hereof, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as wel the allegacions of the Papistes for Peters being at Rome substantially confuted, as reasons brought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the same. And therefore had it not bene so necessare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appertinent to the argument of this booke, I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue referred the reader to their doynges, then haue spoken any thing thereof. Nowe it remayneth to leaue Peter, and to come to the bishops of Rome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:711:33"/>The order of this history requirth that euerye byshop should be here placed as eche succeded other: But there is suche confusion amonge them that wryte of them, that no man can certainly tell whome to place first, second, thirde, nor fourth. And least it be thought to be spoken rather of affection then otherwyse, I thought good to shewe out of <hi>Vspergensis</hi> their owne authour, what wrangling and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sagreement there is, for those that succeded Peter, which though it be somwhat lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, yet is it necessary to be shewed, that it may appeare what certaintie they haue of Peter, &amp; those to whome he committed this vniuersall Popedome.

                     </gap>and the tymes, wherein they raigned from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, diuerse men thinke diuersly: whose opinions I wil here briefly set downe, &amp;c. Some wryte whereunto the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall history agreeth, that after the death of Peter sitting at Rome chiefe of the Churche xxv. yeares. <hi>Linus</hi> did next take the gouernement vpon him. And when he had ruled xii. yeares, in the second yeare of <hi>Titus,</hi> he lefte it to <hi>Anacletus,</hi> who also after other xii. yeares gaue it to <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whiche semeth to be in the xiii. yeare of <hi>Domician. Clement</hi> after nine yeares suffered vnder <hi>Traian.</hi> After him in the fourth place, came <hi>Euaristus,</hi> the nexte was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> and then <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and so forth. But other wryte that <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus,</hi> were both vnder Peter (<hi>as his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars or curates</hi>) and that Peter as soone as he had taken the Papacy vpon him, did appointe <hi>Linus</hi> in his steade to gouerne the churche, whereby he him selfe might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter folowe his function of preaching: and that he departing after twelue yeres, Peter did substitute <hi>Cletus</hi> in his place, who also dying after twelue yeres, euen the same yere that Peter suffered vnder <hi>Nero.</hi> Then Peter committed his seate to <hi>Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> giuing to him and his successours power to bynde and loose, whome <hi>Anacletus</hi> succeded in the tyme
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:711:33"/>
of <hi>Domician,</hi> then folowed <hi>Euaristus,</hi> &amp;c. But because these accomptes do not agree, let vs consider wherein they differ, and so trie whiche semeth more credible. Therefore if <hi>Linus</hi> left <hi>Anacletus,</hi> and he <hi>Clemens,</hi> then is <hi>Clement</hi> thrust out of the beadroll of Popes, whose reuerence is so great among all Churches, that he is not only mentioned among martyrs, but also in the Canon of the masse, and in the <hi>Letany</hi> or procession, is placed betwene <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens.</hi> But if after <hi>Linus, Cletus</hi> be placed, and then <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> then <hi>Euaristus,</hi> then <hi>Alexander, &amp;c</hi> there is no place for <hi>Anacletus</hi> to get in. And <hi>Beda</hi> in his <hi>Martyrtologie,</hi> that <hi>Anacletus</hi> was the fourthe after Peter, and suffered vnder <hi>Domician,</hi> making <hi>Linus</hi> first, <hi>Cletus</hi> second, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> thirde, and <hi>Anacletus</hi> fourth. But if <hi>Anacletus</hi> be placed after <hi>Clement,</hi> and as <hi>Beda</hi> sayeth, died vnder <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mician,</hi> then cannot it holde that his predecessour <hi>Clemens</hi> should suffer vnder <hi>Traian,</hi> because it may euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he suffered vnder <hi>Domician,</hi> if his successour <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacletus</hi> bee not denied to suffer vnder the same Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure. Furthermore, if <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Anacletus,</hi> as some saye, or <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus,</hi> as other saye: did bothe rule twelue yeares a peece after the death of Peter, dyinge the xiiii. yeare of <hi>Nero,</hi> then it arysing to 24. yeares, it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out that the latter of them should suffer in the xii. of <hi>Domician,</hi> &amp; so <hi>Clemens</hi> could not receaue power to binde and loose, neither the seate of Peter. Whiche opinion also is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed of diuerse: and to this is added that <hi>Dionysius Areopagita</hi> hasting from <hi>Athens</hi> to Rome againste the martyrdome of the Apostles Peter and Paule, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a little to late, and sone after their deathes, did there finde <hi>Clemens</hi> his scholefellowe bishop of Rome. &amp;c. Who sent the same <hi>Dionysius</hi> into Fraunce to preache: But it is saide that this <hi>Dionysius</hi> was martyred <hi>Anno domini.</hi> 96 whiche is the xiiii. yeare of <hi>Domician,</hi> and before his death he had continued long, &amp; had done very muche in Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
<pb facs="tcp:711:34"/>
and yet it is sayde that <hi>Clemens</hi> who sent him thether, was made byshop but the twelfth yeare of <hi>Domician.</hi> Againe, the booke of the passion of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> saith, that <hi>Clemens</hi> was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first after Peter, for so it is there writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. In the fift place after Peter came <hi>Alexander.</hi> But if it were the second from Peter, then it foloweth that <hi>Cletus</hi> being before <hi>Clement,</hi> and <hi>Anacletus</hi> after him be pushed out, because <hi>Alexander</hi> must be the fifte: Namely Peter first, <hi>Linus</hi> seconde, <hi>Clement</hi> thirde, <hi>Euariste</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the fifte: For otherwyse <hi>Alexander</hi> cannot be the fift from Peter, because if <hi>Linus</hi> be the seconde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Peter, and <hi>Cletus</hi> after <hi>Anacletus,</hi> be placed before <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Alexander</hi> shalbe the sixt: But if <hi>Cletus</hi> be before <hi>Clement,</hi> and <hi>Anacletus</hi> after him, then shall <hi>Alexander</hi> be the seuenth, vnlesse <hi>Clement</hi> be the second after Peter.</p>

                  <head>¶ The first face of the Romaine churche vnder Heathen Emperours.</head>
                  <p>FOr the first sorte of Romayne byshops, that is from <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to <hi>Syluester,</hi> they liued continually vnder persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For as <hi>Eusebius</hi> sheweth, from the yeare of our lord 67. till the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> being about thre hundred yeares, were tenne persecutions. The first by <hi>Nero,</hi> with al rigour and crueltie that might be, wherof <hi>Hierome</hi> in his epistle to <hi>Cramatius</hi> and <hi>Heliadorus,</hi> saith: that there wer fiue thousand Christians martyred euery daye in the yeare sauing the first daye of <hi>Ianuary</hi>: For they were persecuted by <hi>Nero</hi> his commaundement in all places with diuerse &amp; straunge kinde of torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and reprochefull villanies not to be mencioned.</p>
                  <p>The seconde persecution was moued by the Emperoure <hi>Domician, Anno.</hi> 96. who was a man so much delighted in killing &amp; murthering, that as the prouerbe went of him, he would not haue a flye aliue with him, for being as he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueted moste, solitary by him selfe in his pallaice, he vsed to catche and kill all the flies that came in his waye. Againe he was so hawty aboue measure, that he woulde nedes be counted a God, and therefore it may easely be iudged, what rest the Christians had in his time.</p>
                  <p>The thirde persecution was raysed by <hi>Traianus Anno</hi> 100. so bloudely that euen the Heathen <hi>Pliny</hi> moued with pitie, bewayled it vnto the Emperoure.</p>
                  <p>The fourth persecution was styrred <hi>Anno.</hi> 167. by the Emperour <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> lasting long vnder sondrie Emperours vnmercifully.</p>
                  <p>The fift persecution was caused by <hi>Seuerus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with all seueritie, forbidding that any more should be baptized, purposing so to roote out the name of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <hi>Anno.</hi> 205.</p>
                  <p>The sixth persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was enkindled by <hi>Maximinꝰ.</hi> 237.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:711:35"/>The seuenth was enflamed by <hi>Decius</hi> the Emperoure, <hi>Anno.</hi> 250. as terrible as the rest.</p>
                  <p>The eight was broched by diuerse parsones in diuerse places. As by <hi>Galerius Maximus</hi> and <hi>Paternus,</hi> procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls in <hi>Aphrica,</hi> by <hi>Emilianus</hi> Liuetenaunt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side diuers other great magistrates in Rome &amp; els where, <hi>Anno.</hi> 259.</p>
                  <p>The ninth by the Emperour <hi>Aurelianus, Anno.</hi> 278.</p>
                  <p>The tenth and last, as the last acte of a tragedy, was brought vpon the churche with all kinde of saueige cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without pity or compassion by the bloudy tyrant <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> and continued by other till the comming of the noble <hi>Constantine.</hi> And this was the state of the churche vnder the Emperours of Rome for these yeares. Nowe let the reader iudge of what maiestie and countenaunce the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in this time were like to be, of what wealth &amp; abilitie to maintaine a po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pous estate.

The puritie of doctrine decayed, &amp; the churche was darkened maruelously with mans tradicions: For Monkery with his manifolde supersticions waxed great: Herewithall sprang vp sale of masses, and praying to the dead, and the Lordes supper began to be an offering for the dead.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:711:103"/>
cast him into prison, where he wrought his death, &amp; forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ere he was buryed vsurped his place: He imparted his treasure (sayth <hi>Benno</hi>) to <hi>Brazutus</hi> and to a certaine Iewe, that were his companions, and by theyr meanes he purchased the voyces of diuers, who ere that <hi>Alexander</hi> was buryed cryed out amayne: Peter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen <hi>Hildebrand</hi> to be Pope, &amp; so they set him in the Popes throne callinge him <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth. And this was done in the thousand yeare after the destruction of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> in the which yeare the Popes began to challenge &amp; take vppon them the name, office, and power of Christe: for it was proclaymed at the enstalling of this <hi>Gregorie,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was created y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true vicar of Christ, &amp; <hi>Gregorie</hi> applyed vnto himselfe those thinges that are spoken in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 7. Psalme of Christe: Hee altered the lawes of God, for where the Scripture lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth al estates to marrye, he barred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gye therof, forcing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vow single life aboue their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. Now was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture in him fulfilled prophesyinge of the warre of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> which this <hi>Gregorie</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched so perillouslye to all Christendome, as the like neuer happened, which his companion <hi>Vrban</hi> the second did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute. <hi>Gregorie</hi> at the first entrye to his Popeship began to vrge such canons, as he had in his auncestours time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured against priestes mariage, and the bestowinge of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices by temporall men, which hee did not of purpose to take away the abuse of byinge and sellinge of ecclesiastical lyuings, but with a fayre showe to abridge Princes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther estates, of their preeminence in that matter, whereby he might binde all the bishops and clergye to be more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to Rome, who now depended more on their Princes, because of the bestowi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the lyuings, wherby the Popes strength encreased, &amp; the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral Princes were weakened, and neglected of their clergye. And the better to atchieue his purpose, because <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour was chiefe of temporall Princes, he attempted it first againste him: for
<pb facs="tcp:711:104"/>
this matter he sommoned a councell at Rome, wherto the Emperour could haue no regarde, because of his warlike affayres then presente. And yet this matter so delighted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, that for compassing it he spared neyther treason nor murther, but in manye places he procured ciuill warre, &amp; sedition, with al kinde of mischiefe that might be. For first seekinge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours death he atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted it diuers wayes, as thus amonge other euen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church: The Emperour (saith <hi>Benno</hi>) vsed to go to prayers to S. Maryes Church in <hi>Auentine</hi> hill. <hi>Hildebrand</hi> therefore hauinge his false espyes caused the place to be wel noted, where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour vsed to kneele or sit in the Church all seruice time: &amp; hyred one to go and laye certaine great stones secretelye in the roofe of the Church righte ouer the same place, in such sort as he might throwe them downe vppon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours head, and so slaye him: which as this fellowe went aboute and was busye wyth a great stone, the waighte thereof o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed him, so as he fell downe to the pauement and the stone vppon him, which brused him so as he dyed of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which hee had prouided to slaye the Emperour withall. This thinge being knowen, the Romaynes bound his hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to a roape, and drewe the dead carkasse through Rome streats three dayes together for an example. Againe (saith <hi>Benno</hi>) <hi>Iohn</hi> bishoppe of <hi>Portua</hi> who was of <hi>Hildebrands</hi> priuye councell, said in his preachinge before the people &amp; clergye in S.

(meaninge that violence which they had vsed towarde the Sacrament of Christes bodye:) Because <hi>Hildebrand</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding of it (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heathen vsed to do of their idols) what successe he shoulde haue against the Emperour, &amp; because the Sacrament spake not and gaue him no aunsweare, he threw it into the fyre, maugre all the Cardinals that were about him, and said to the Sacrament most blasphemous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye: Could the idoll Gods of the heathens giue them aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:711:104"/>
of theyr successe, and can not thou tell mee? He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated the Emperour being a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable Prince, withoute lawfull accusation, without canonicall citacion, or iudicial order: and caused his peeres to reuolt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and soughte by secrete traytors to murther him. Also hee caused the bishops to sweare them selues vtter ennemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, wresting &amp; wringinge places of the Scripture to make a shew to maintaine his purpose, But (sayth <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>) as sone as he roose vp from his chayre being newly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of wood, by Gods workinge it claue in peeces &amp; was rente terriblye into diuers partes.</p>
               <p>When he sawe that his secrete treasons toke not effect, he brast out into open outrage and enmitye: he excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the Emperour, and discharged all his subiectes of theyr allegeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; gaue his crowne vnto <hi>Rodolpho</hi> duke of <hi>Sueuia,</hi> which he sent to him with this poesye.

                  </q>
This moued the Emperour very sore, in so much that hee stripped himselfe out of his royall roabes, and puttinge on wollen apparell, came with his wyfe and his sonne a litle child in the depth of winter, a cruel and perillous iourneye to <hi>Canusius,</hi> and stoode barefooted at the gates of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, fasting from morning to night, suing humblye for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at <hi>Hildebrands</hi> hand, and for three dayes suffered with lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table miserye to be laughed at, and flowted by <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi> amonge his paragons and monkes. He desired of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be let in to come to the Pope, but hee was still aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered for three dayes together, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope was not yet at leasure to speake with him. The good and gentle Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour toke it paciently to be thus delayed, and because he could not be let into the Citye, he abode in the suburbes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his great inconuenience, for the frost was verye extreame more then ordinarye: and yet he endured it continuallye 3. dayes, least by taking his ease he should haue offended my Lorde bishops grace, and still he sued to be pardoned.

And thoughe hee craued pardon on his knees, &amp; offered vp his Crowne, yet would the Pope neither pardon him nor absolue him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee woulde promise that accordinge to the Popes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment he would purge him of his fault in the councel, with other vnlawfull conditions. All which he promised and confirmed with hand &amp; seale, and yet was not restored to his estate. This being knowen, the Princes &amp; Lordes of Italye were highlye offended that the Emperour <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in such maner with so great dishonour, and so shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye had submitted himselfe to recouer the fauoure of this <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who by treachery purloyned the Popedome, and defiled all thinges with slaughter and harlotrye. But the Pope and his Cardinals beinge puffed vp with this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had brought the Emperour to this seruile yoake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to attempt further matters: but <hi>Henry</hi> reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged this dishonour sone after by the sworde, and after sharpe battel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he ouercame <hi>Rodolpho,</hi> who hauinge his hand cutte of commaunded to bring vnto him the bishops and auctors of his rebellion, before whom he sayde thus hauing his hand layde before them. I am (quoth he) iustye plagued, lo this is the hand wherewith I pleighted my allegeaunce to my soueraigne Lord <hi>Henry,</hi> and by your enticements I haue often time fought against him to my losse, and falsifyed my fayth, and therefore haue receyued the rewarde due to my periurye: Consider therefore whether ye haue guided me righte or no: Go ye therefore, and stand to your first fayth vowed to your king, for I must go to my father: this being said, he dyed. After his death at the Popes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they set vp another to be Emperour, one <hi>Harman</hi> a Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> County of <hi>Lucelburg</hi>: who while he was assaulting a certaine Castell in Germanye, was slaine by a certaine

                  <hi>Egbertus</hi> a Marquesse, who also being taken in a Mill by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours frends, was miserably slaine.

He draue out furious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye from their places all those bishops and abbots, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were established by the Emperour. At this time there was a certaine prelate called <hi>Fluentinus,</hi> who seinge the greate enormityes that presently choaked the Christian Church, held opinion that <hi>Antichrist</hi> was incarnate and borne, and that he was reuealed herein. And therefore (sayth <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>) the Pope held a councel against him, with the bishops of Italy and Fraunce, in Rome: amonge other canons he concluded it heresye to denye obedience to the Pope, and made a canon for paying of tenthes to priestes, concluding it siane against the holye Ghoste to sell the tenthes. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and published the excommunication against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and caused the bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> of <hi>Collen,</hi> and of <hi>VVormes,</hi> to thrust him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his estate, taking his Crowne from him with al princelye title, dignitye and honour. Yea and which is horrible to be heard, not content with this he did prouoke and arme his onelye sonne <hi>Henry</hi> the fifte, to rebell against him being his naturall father: A lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pitifull case, to see the onelye child of so good &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:711:108"/>
a father, not beinge prouoked by any iniurye on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers part, not onely to despise, to forsake and reuolt from his father, denying to ayde him, but also to assault hym by force of armes, &amp; to enclose him with his armye as he did, and toke him entrapped by treason, spoyled &amp; robbed him of his royal estate, and forced the wretched and miserable man captiue to his owne child, to dye a double and dolefull death. Thus could the Pope put the sworde in the sonnes hand, forsing him to sheath it in his fathers bowels: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could this vnnaturall death of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good olde man, cause the vnnaturall rancour to dye in the Popes breast, but for further reuenge he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that the Emperours car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasse should not be buryed, but first be cast out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church and be caryed from <hi>Leodos</hi> to <hi>Spira,</hi> where it rotted fiue yeares without any Christian burial. But lo what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God wrought in the meane time. To testify (sayth Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas <hi>Vspergensis</hi>) the Popes tyrannye, it rayned bloud at <hi>Spira.</hi> It were a lamentable thing to tell at large the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Popes vnmerciful dealing with this good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. For first the forenamed bishops comminge to him to <hi>Hilgeshem,</hi> they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to deliuer vp his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme, his Purple roabes, his Signet and other like orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belonging to the Empyre. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he required a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof, they aunsweared partly for sellinge spirituall liuinges, but chiefely for the Popes pleasure. Wyth that the good Emperour sighing saide: Ye know you receyued your bishoprickes at my hande, that I gaue them freelye and am giltye of no suche cryme, and yet do you thus quite my curtesye? But the vnthankful prelates moued neither with allegeaunce, oath, nor benefite, prosecuted their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: and first yelding him no reuerence, they plucked fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him (sitting in his place of estate) his Crowne Emperial, and his Purple roabe, and his Scepter. He beinge thus stripped out of his royaltye and forsaken, sayde pacientlye <hi>Let God see and iudge.</hi> They leauing him, bestowed these
<pb facs="tcp:711:109"/>
things vppon the sonne creating him, &amp; causing him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pursue his father, forcing him to flye but wyth ix. parsons to the Dukedome of <hi>Limborough,</hi> where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke beinge his deadly ennemye did also make speede to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende him. The Emperour perceyuing himselfe thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped and fearing death, submitted himselfe to the duke, beseaching him rather to shewe mercye then vengeaunce: Herevpon the noble harted duke, thoughe the Emperour had whilom displaced him of his Dukedome, yet pityinge his miserye he both forgaue him &amp; entertayned him curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in his Castel, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an armye conducted him to <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> where he was well receyued. But the sonne hearinge thereof besieged the Citye, but the father fled by night to <hi>Leodium,</hi> where so manye louinge hartes resorted to him, that he bad his sonne a battaile and ouerthrewe him, and still desyred that if his sonne were taken, he should be saued harmelesse. Yet the sonne ceased not, but renuinge the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile preuayled and so dispossessed his father: whoe in the ende was brougth to such penurye, that he craued of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Spire</hi> to giue him but a prebende to liue vppon in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church: But the earle forgetting the benefites receyued of him in his prosperitye, denyed him flatlye and said, by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye ye get none here. Thus after he had raigned 50 yeare in his life he lacked lyuinge, and after death he wanted a graue throughe malice of the Pope.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Paschal</hi> held a councell of Princes and bishoppes about matter of gaynes, as homages and fealtyes due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, also he spoiled the bishop of <hi>Rauenna</hi> of his lands, and toke them into his owne handes: But afterwarde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he refused to confirme certaine bishops appointed by the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, the Emperour (though la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This broyle being ceased, and <hi>Henry</hi> being crowned Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <hi>Paschal</hi> renued vnto him the auctoritye of appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bishops, and pronounced openlye in the Church, that they were all held accursed, who soeuer would disanul the preuiledge which he had graunted: Then thy sange <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria in excelsis,</hi> because of this peace betwene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour and the Pope. But as sone as the Emperour (this being done) was departed into Germanye, the Pope brake al his oathes, and went from his word in euerye thinge, saying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee did it not freelye and of his owne accorde, but that for feare hee yelded to the Emperours desire. Then was the priuiledge condemned, and the Emperour excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and terrible tragedyes sturred, which were all blazed throughe diuers countryes.

                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:711:117"/>Here may you discerne somwhat the dealing and spirite of the Romain bishops, which I leaue to euery ones owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different consideration. To returne to the matter, hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> did excommunicate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, and by his Legates sent from Rome prouoked rebellions against him in Italye and other places: and brought it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to passe, that the conspiracye of the rebels should be made the stronger, by these lawes confirmed among them by oath, that none of them should take peace with him, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute the whole consent of all the rest. And againe, that if this Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> should dye, they should choose none to be Pope, but one of those Cardinals that were of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracye against the Emperour. But shortlye after God punished this <hi>Hadrian</hi> very straungelye for (sayth <hi>Abbas Vspergensis in Frederico primo</hi>) it came to passe that this Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> the fourth, going to <hi>Agnania</hi> to denounce the excommunication against the Emperour, after he had taryed there a fewe dayes, walked forth with some of his companye, to coole him selfe: And when he came to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine springe of water he drancke thereof, and forthwith a flye did enter into his mouth, and did cleaue to his throte in such sort, that no art of the Phisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s could get it away, and so he was choaked therew<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, and died therof <hi>Anno</hi> 1159. in the fift yeare of his Popeship. But the Italians being thus set on by the Pope, deuised continuallye treasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, amonge other, practised to haue mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him by a certaine counterfeit foole, beinge in deede an excellente Musician, who had surelye slaine him, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Emperour driuen to his shift leaped out at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fifte win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow downe into a riuer, which ranne vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where he was: The foole beinge taken was also throwne downe out of the same windowe, and so he brake his necke. After this they hyred an enchanter of <hi>Arabia,</hi> who poysoned his bridle, his spurres, his ringes, and his stirope, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges, that with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onlye touching thereof he should

And because he might assure Rome to himselfe, hee sente letters forthwith to <hi>Iohn</hi> Cardinall of <hi>sainct Peters</hi> Church, who supplyed his roume there, who by briberye and flatterye so curried fauor with the people, that he allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the most parte of the Citye to fauour <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to make those Consuls that did most leane to his part.

But while he was thus busye here in the East, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> was not yet quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but both he and his conspiratours stil feared him, if he should euer returne into Italye, and therefore <hi>Alexander</hi> still deuised how to haue him destroyed. He sent a cunning painter to go to the place where the Emperour was, who (the Emperour not knowing thereof) shoulde drawe his picture: this being perfectly done, he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded a secret messenger to conuey it to the <hi>Soldan,</hi> &amp; wrote a letter w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>all to the <hi>Soldan</hi> certefying him that it was the Emperours picture, and tellinge him that if he would liue quietlye, he must worke the feate to haue him destroyed by som traine.

But when the Emperour hauinge wonne <hi>Hierusalem</hi> retired wyth his army homeward, he hauing no feare of himselfe did deuide his armye into diuers partes, whereby they might returne the more conuenientlye for vittaile and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge one after another. But in <hi>Armenia</hi> being on a time in a great heate and sweatinge, partly with trauell, partly with the heate of the Sunne, mistrusting no daunger in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saluage country full of woddes, he taking a fewe horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him &amp; his chaplein, did step fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his armye.

The Princes promised to assist him to performe his promise to the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and in great disdaine against Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> traitour to the Empyre, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to ayde him. The armye was gathered, hee came to Rome, and not a man through out Italye withstoode him: and sending his Embassadours into the Citye, he demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Romaynes (concealing his owne iniurye) that the Church might be brought to quietnes by hearing both the Popes causes heard: and that the right bishop mighte haue his place, whereby the Church might be gouerned by one. If they would do this, he promised that he woulde graunte them not onely peace, but would restore them all their righte. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> perceyuinge that by this meanes the Emperour mighte obtayne his purpose to be reuenged on him, fled by night to <hi>Caieta,</hi> afterward to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuent</hi>: last of all in the 17 yeare of his Popeship, he came to <hi>Venice</hi> disguised in the apparell of one that was his cooke, where lurking in an abbey he became a Gardener. A while after he was bewrayed and knowne, and there v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon calling a councell by the commaundement of duke <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian,</hi> he was receyued with great honour, and brought into S.

                  <hi>Venetians</hi> to yeld to him his ennemye, being likewyse the ennemye of the common wealth. The <hi>Venetians</hi> denyed to do it: therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour sente his sonne <hi>Otho</hi> with a nauye of souldiours to demaund <hi>Alexander</hi> of them, but he charged him withall that he should attempt nothing in any case, till he himselfe were come vnto him. But <hi>Otho</hi> being a lustye yonge Prince ful of courage and desirous of renowne, neglecting his fathers commaundement, would needes encounter the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whereby hee was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, taken prisoner, bounde &amp; brought to <hi>Venice.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Alexander</hi> began to set vp his crest and put out his hornes, and woulde not take peace with the Emperour in anye case, vnlesse the Emperour would come to <hi>Venice,</hi> &amp; take suche conditions of peace, as hee woulde offer him. Whereuppon the good and carefull father to prouide for the infortunate miserye of his sonne, promised hee woulde come at the time appointed: and so came where they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned vppon conditions of peace. But the Pope woulde not absolue the Emperour of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, till he came to S. Markes Church, where before all the people, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> commaunded the Emperour to prostrate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on the ground, and to craue pardon. The Emperour did as hee commaunded him: then the Pope trode on the Emperours necke with his foote, sayinge it is written: <hi>Thou shalt walke vppon the serpent and adder, and shalt treade downe vnder rhy feete the Lion and dragon.</hi> The Emperour disdayninge this reproche aunswered: It was not sayd to thee but to Peter. The Pope then treadinge downe his necke againe sayde: <hi>Both to mee and to Peter.</hi> The Emperour then fearing some daunger, durst saye no more, &amp; so the peace was concluded. The conditions wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are these, that the Emperour should vphold <hi>Alexander</hi> to be true Pope, that he should restore all that did belonge to the Church of Rome, which had beene taken away in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres: Thus the Emperour departed with his sonne.

The Pope to shew himselfe thankfull to <hi>Venice,</hi> bestowed of his liberality giftes vppon duke <hi>Sebastian</hi> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate. First he gaue them a white Taper which onely the Popes vsed to Beare. Secondlye he lycensed them to seale theyr letters with leade: and he graunted theyr Duke the third seate in the Popes Theatre. Fourthly he graunted that on Ascention daye, they should haue whole and perfit pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for euer at S. Markes Church. Fiftly he gaue the Duke viii. banners of silke, and an attier for the head like an hat. Afterward <hi>Alexander</hi> depriued the bishop of <hi>Papia</hi> of his Pall, &amp; exempted him of the dignitye of caryinge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crosse, because he toke the Emperours part. He made many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons in a councel at <hi>Lateran,</hi> as that an archbishop should not receyue his Pall, vnlesse he had sworne first to be true and obedient to the Pope. And that a man should not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye his brothers wyfe beinge wydowe, that they that toke orders should vowe chastetye, that a bastarde should not be made a bishop, that the canonizinge of Saincts belonged onlye to the Pope, &amp; that such sainctes should haue deuine honour.

                  <hi>GRegorie</hi> the ninth borne in <hi>Campania,</hi> was nephew to <hi>Innocentius</hi> the thirde. He maintayned the quarell of his predecessour <hi>Honorius,</hi> against the Emperour. This <hi>Gregorie</hi> (as <hi>Marius</hi> wryteth) was more maliciouslye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed toward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayd <hi>Frederick</hi>: for he accused him because he woulde not fulfill that vaine promise, to the needelesse sheddinge of Christian bloud, which he made to <hi>Honorius</hi> for the vnprofitable recoueringe of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> And therefore this <hi>Gregorie</hi> did excommunicate him, before the Emperour coulde be hearde to speake, or were conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by reason: neither woulde hee suffer the Emperours Embassadours to come to his presence, nor heare them in the councell which came to alleadge good and reasonable excuses in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours behalfe, as his owne sickenes at his settinge forward caused him to staye, besides the death of the Lautgraue. Therfore (sayth <hi>Vspergensis</hi>) this Pope like a proude man, began in his first yeare to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat and curse the Emperour for certaine foolish and false cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, neglectinge all order of iudgement, as the Emperour sheweth in excusinge himselfe in his epistle to the Princes of Almanye: openinge to them (because the Pope refused
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:711:129"/>
to heare it) his innocencye and vpright dealing. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certaine noblemen in Rome, namely of the house cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Frangentes panem,</hi> when the Pope did the second time excommunicate <hi>Frederick,</hi> they caused the Pope to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen oute of the Citye with foule shame, so that he ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye byding at <hi>Peruse</hi> al that yeare, &amp; the yeare folowing. Yet no meanes could asswage his furye: but he prouoked <hi>Iohn</hi> kinge of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> &amp; the foresaid Earles of <hi>Thus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> rebels to the Emperour, and manye other Princes to trouble him. The Emperour appointed a day of assembly for diuers Christian Princes at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> and the Princes were making speede thether to obeye him, but by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement they went backe againe: and certaine souldiours wearing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crosse by the Emperours appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the voyage to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> were robbed and spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all their prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Emperour seing this sought to appease the Popes furye, and to get his goodwil prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his iourney according to his promise to <hi>Hierusalem</hi>: he tooke shippe and sayled into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and afterward to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> and striued much against the <hi>Soldan</hi> for the Christian fayth, with great paine and trauell. In the meane time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope (seing the Emperours absence seruinge his turne) gat <hi>Apulia</hi> to be vnder his obeisance: and forbad that the souldiours wearing crosses shoulde passe ouer to assist the Emperour, but he draue them oute of <hi>Apulia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,</hi> shewinge himselfe a wicked and mischieuous man by many other meanes, in slaying those Germaynes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the Emperour, moste cruellye. Thus while the good Emperour defended the flocke of Christe with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sworde abroade, the Pope deuoured and spoyled them at home. After the Emperour had wonne from the <hi>Solda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Hierusalem, Nazereth,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioppa,</hi> hee toke a truce with him for tenne yeares, whereof he certifyed the Pope by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, looking that the Pope woulde haue shewed himselfe ioyfull therof, and all Christians likewyse: But the Pope
<pb facs="tcp:711:130"/>
despysing and reiecting the letters, commaunded the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers that broughte them to be put to death, leaste they should make report of the Emperours noble successe. Also he spreade this rumour that the Emperour was dead, to this ende, to make such Cityes in <hi>Apulia</hi> to shrincke for feare, as had with stode to submit themselues to him. And both to stop the Emperours returne, and to obtaine <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> at his pleasure, he wrote to the <hi>Soldan</hi> desyring him not to yeld the <hi>Holy lande</hi> to the Emperour, as he was about to do. But the Emperour finishing his matters with the <hi>Soldan,</hi> returned into Italye, whereupon the slaughter of his men done by the Pope as they returned stayed: and within a while he draue the Popes power oute of <hi>Apulia,</hi> and by the helpe of God recouered all his owne from him. Hereupon the Pope did exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate him, and curse him a newe, and conspired with the <hi>Lombards</hi> and <hi>Thuscans</hi> to rebell against him, because he had made a league with the <hi>Soldan.</hi> But in the ende many Princes seekinge to set them at vnitye,<note place="margin">

                  </note> the Emperour had absolution of the Pope, paying to him for it, ere (as <hi>Platina</hi> saith) he could obtaine it, an hundred thousande ounces of gould. For (sayth <hi>Vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pergensis</hi>) notwithstanding all these iniuries, yet so often as the Pope did excommunicate him, he craued and sued for the benefite of absolution humblye, with all obedience, deuocion &amp; yelding of iustice. Soone after the Emperour prepared to go into Germanye, to redresse certaine disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders doone by his eldest sonne <hi>Henry</hi>: the Pope hearinge thereof wrote to the estates of Germanye, commaundinge that they should make none of the Emperours family king of the Romaynes, because the kinge of the Romaines is heyre apparent to the Empyre. <hi>Frederick</hi> vnderstanding this treachery, and that the Pope had conspired a freshe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> manye Princes of Italy against him, did forthwith inuade Italy, suppressed the rebellious <hi>Lombards,</hi> wanne diuers townes in <hi>Vmbria</hi> and <hi>Hetruria,</hi> subdued to the Empyre

               <p>Thus was the Emperour nowe the thirde time excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Pope, and pronounced not Emperour: but at this time there were manye Cardinals y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> disalowed the Popes doing, so that the Emperour had many frends in Italy, because he still sued and sought for the Popes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and could not haue it, and now therefore he set all at defiance in maner afore shewed. Of this <hi>Gregorie</hi> (<hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus Parisius</hi> sayth further) callinge him bloud sucker &amp; couetous Pope, that he held a councell at Rome to depose the Emperour, who had maryed Isabel doughter to king Iohn of England: and ere the councell began, he caused y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles heades to be borne aboute the Citye in a solemne procession, that the sighte thereof mighte astonishe mens mindes, and drawe their hartes from the Emperour. Also he gaue free pardon to euery one that would fight against him. The Emperour vnderstanding it, stopped all passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges both by Sea and lande, and taking many Cardinals &amp; other prelates as they were sayling awaye, he put them in prison: hee drowned ii. Cardinals in the Sea, &amp; of the rest some bishops, abbots and chaplins, and amonge them the Popes brother for their notorious and haynous treasons were hanged. The first excommunication y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was sent out against this Emperour arose of this grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: because them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour would not at the Popes commaundement daunger himselfe and many Christians with him, to go out to fight for the holy land. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope as it appeared by his actes, coueted to encroch the kingdome of both <hi>Sicils, Apulia,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:711:131"/>
other landes, so that he sought meanes how to destroy the Emperour being inheritour thereof, which he mighte see come to passe by the chaunce of the warre: or els while the Emperour should there haue beene busye against the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, he in the meane time as chiefe prelate (hauing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome committed to his credite) mighte the more easely disposses y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour. Furthermore this <hi>Gregorie</hi> was the cause of sedicion in Rome for banishing one <hi>Hannibal</hi> oute of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate, because he sued to recouer the aunciente Romaine libertyes. Also he prouoked the <hi>Polonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the <hi>Prutenians</hi> being his foes. He made that cursed deuision in Italy, which to the great confusion of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bloud, lasteth to this daye betweene the <hi>Guelphes</hi> and <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belines</hi>: for these being two of the most noble and famous houses in Italye, whereof the one name whollye (that is the <hi>Gibelines</hi>) toke part with the Emperour, &amp; the <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Pope, and this quarrel hath &amp; doth last to this day, betwene all of the one name against all of the other w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> continuall reuenge, as oportunitye serueth from time to time. Amonge diuers other his superstitious deedes these were some, he canonized S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> S, <hi>Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis,</hi> S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thony</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> and others, thereby to aduaunce the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of the begging fryers, &amp; of their holinesse. He decreed that the white fryers should possesse nothing but male As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and such foode as coms of certaine birdes and beastes as egges &amp; milke, and all other thinges they should begge from doore to doore, as <hi>Paleonydorus</hi> sayth. He graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Iewes to be enfranchised for money in spite of all Christian Princes. He forbad any man to haue aboue one benefice. He commaunded out of Englande the fift part, &amp; out of lowe Germany the twenteth part of all Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes. He appointed that to <hi>Aue Maria</hi> should be songe <hi>Salue regina,</hi> and the sacringe bell to be ronge then and at eleuation time.

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1250. <hi>Frederick</hi> dyed, and as some write in his last will and testamente he gaue a summe of moneye for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:711:134"/>
to the Church of Rome, and bequeathed his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and the order of all thinges to his sonne <hi>Conradus.</hi> This Will was brought to the Pope to be approued, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope did whollye disanull and frustrate the Will, sayinge that the Prince whom he had deposed, could make no Wil and so it was voide. Within a while after a yonge Prince to whom the Emperour by his sonne Kinge <hi>Henry</hi> was grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfather was murthered, but by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could tell.</p>
               <p>About this time before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of <hi>Frederick,</hi> there were certaine preachers in <hi>Sweueland</hi> who stoutlye and openly preached against the Pope and his Cardinals, &amp; iustifyed the doinge of <hi>Frederick</hi> and his sonne <hi>Conradus,</hi> sayinge bouldly that the Pope, his bishops and Cardinals, had no auctoritye, because they were al stayned with that one blot of simony, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their power depended not vppon Christ: &amp; that a priest committing deadly sinne, coulde neither binde nor loose, nor consecrate: that no man in the world might forbid a Christian to execute diuine functions, &amp; that they should be hearde &amp; celebrated without any difference. And in the ende of their Sermons this pardon (quoth they) which we do pronounce vnto you, wee do not declare it to you as forged by the Pope and his prelates, but proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge from Almightye God. These preachers were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned by <hi>Conradus,</hi> and therfore he incurred almost dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life.</p>
               <p>In the former councell helde at <hi>Lions</hi> it was decreed that the Cardinals should ryde on their trapped Gennets throughe the streates, and weare red hattes and crimsen roabes: to signifye (sayth <hi>Parisius</hi>) that they are readye to spend their bloud for the Catholicke fayth and the safetye of the people: but as (<hi>Platina</hi> sayth) for the honour of their estate. Also in that councell <hi>Innocentius</hi> decreed amonge manye matters that the Pope mighte depose the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. He did greatly fauoure the order of begging fryers, and bestowed on them manye priuiledges and benefittes.
<pb facs="tcp:711:135"/>
He preferred the <hi>Dominicans</hi> to dignityes Ecclesiastical: and aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced the <hi>Francisca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> to be the Popes confessours: He adopted the White fryers and <hi>Augustine</hi> friers to be his sonnes: wher as they liued before in deserts he brought them into Cityes, teachinge them to begge their breade w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> idlenes. By the helpe of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> he reformed the rule of the Whitefryers, mitigated it, and finallye with his blessinge confirmed it that (as the sayd rule sheweth) they should hope to be saued not onlye by Christ: He grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted these &amp; the begging fryers lycence to preach, to dispute, and to shriue people. Also he exempted them from all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer &amp; iurisdiction of kinges and bishops: whereupon they crammed the worlde ful, and chaoked it with their gloses vpon Sentences, decretals, cannons, wich their commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vpon <hi>Aristotle,</hi> their Sophisms, Repertories, Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And in these dayes the world was fallen into such grosse blindnesse, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and barbarousnesse, that not onelye knowledge in diuinity, but also other learning was almost decayed, the knowledge of the tongues as Greeke and Hebrew buried in ignoraunce, &amp; though some rubbishe of the latine tongue were left, yet it was rustye, corrupte, and broken stuffe, as appeareth yet by theyr wrytings, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the like barbarousnesse is not in any tongue. But to returne to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi>: he canonized diuers, makinge them saincts that for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncemente had played the traytours and rebels against theyr owne Princes, as one <hi>Edmond</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and other of sondrye places.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:711:135"/>Till the time of this <hi>Innocentius</hi> the 4. (sayth <hi>Biblian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>) it was not an article of fayth, nor a law of the Church that men should worship the breade and the wyne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: therefore (sayth he) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope as a creator brought forth a newe God <hi>Mauzis</hi> by transubstantiation. This Pope offred to sell to king <hi>Henry</hi> the third of England, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome of both <hi>Sicils</hi> to the vse of his sonne Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and yet <hi>Conradus</hi> kinge thereof was lyuinge. He vexed and polled the Churches of England with mysera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exactions: for money he maintayned and licensed anye wickednes amonge the clergye, suffering worser matters in his bastards whereof he had diuers, especiallye one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>VVilliam.</hi> One <hi>Robert Capito</hi> bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> had a great controuersye with this Pope, for he detested &amp; defyed both in preachinge and wrytinge, the Popes coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, pride and tyrannye. He would not admit one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes bastardes because he was vnlearned and but a boye of yeares, to a canonship of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> but rebuked y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope for it in a letter, and withstoode the Popes pollinge &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binge the Realme: and therefore the Pope receyuinge the sharpe letter from this <hi>Robert Grosted,</hi> for anger rayled not onlye on the bishop, but also brast into these arrogante wordes against his Prince king <hi>Henry</hi> the third, sayinge (as <hi>Mattheus Parisius</hi> testifyeth): Is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinge of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our vassel, our slaue, &amp; our page, who may at our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to hamper him, put him in prison, &amp; to vtter shame? And finallye because he coulde not tell howe otherwise to ease his rancke stomacke against the bishop hee excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated him: but he constantlye defyed and despised his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication euen to the death. He defended in disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope could do nothinge against iustice &amp; truth, and that he was worse then Lucifer and Antichrist: at the length being cited to appeare in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, and condempned by the Pope wrongfullye, he appealed to the iudgemente of Christe.

But maruell not therat, for thy mother, which is the ladie of people, lyke a wydowe hauinge maryed and coupled her selfe to her subiect, hath appointed him to be thy father, that is to saye, the byshoppe of Rome, who sheweth no point of any fatherlye loue towards thee, He magnifyeth and extendeth to the vttermost his authoritye ouer thee: And by experience declareth himselfe to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> husband of thy mother.

yearelye taxes, not to kill men, but to offer giftes &amp; sacrifices for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: and to sorowe wyth them, that be ignoraunt and do erre. And so we read of Peter the fisher (whose successor he boasteth himselfe to be) that after the resurrection of Christ he turned with other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, to the office of fishinge, who when he could take nothing of the left syde of the ship, at the bidding of Christ, turned to the right side, and drewe to the lande a net full of fishes. Wherefore the profitable mynisterye of the Church is to be exercised on the right syde, by the which the deuill is ouercome, and plentye of soules be lucrifyed and wonne to Christe. But certainlye the labourer on the left side of the ship, is farre otherwyse: for in it the fayth stumbleth, heauines bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rule, whan that thing that is desired by seekinge, is not founde. For who is so foolishe to thinke that hee can both at one time serue God and man, and to satisfye his owne will, or to sticke to the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of flesh and bloud, and to offer worthy giftes to Christ? And doubtles, that shepeheard that watcheth not for the edifyinge of the flocke, prepareth an other way to the roringe Lyon, and seeking who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he maye deuoure. And nowe behold, I say, O daughter, the deedes of him that is called thy father, such as haue not beene hearde of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: he dryueth away the good shepeheard from the sheepefold, and placeth in their steade bishops, to rule, but not to profyte (his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, cosins, and parentes) some that knewe no letters, and other some domme and deafe, which vnderstand not the plaine voyce of the sheepe, nor curing their wounds that be hurt of the wolues: but like hyrelinges pluckinge of the fleeses a pase, and reaping that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men haue sowen, whose handes moreouer be alwayes readye in theyr baskets and pouches, but theyr backes are turned from theyr burdens. By which thinge it is manifest y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the priesthoode is cleane chaunged at these dayes, the seruice of God decayed, almes dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and broughte to noughte, the whole deuotion of princes, and kinges is banished. Maye not this be thought wonderful in the eyes of all men, that where as Christ commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded tribute to be payd to kinges for him &amp; for Peter, he nowe goeth about dominion of his stile, to subdue to him, both realmes and princes of realmes (against his will, whose Uicar he sayth he is, and who refused the realmes &amp; iudgements of this world) which this bishop contrarywyse chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, clayming al that which he in his stile wryteth to be his. Alacke, O daughter, what doth he yet more against thee: marke, he draweth from thee what so euer pleaseth him, and yet he thinketh not himselfe content, to haue the tenth part onely of thy goodes from thee: except
<pb facs="tcp:711:148"/>
he haue also the first fruites of the benefices of the Ministers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may get a newe patrimony aswell for himselfe as for his kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, contrary to the godly wyls of the first founders. Ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all this, he inferreth other execrable taxes and stipends for his Legates and messengers, whom he sendeth into England, which not onely take awaye the feeding and clothing of thee and thine, but also teare in peeces like dogges your fleshe and skinnes. Maye not this prince be compared to kinge <hi>Nabugodonoser,</hi> which destroyed the temple of the Lorde, and robbed awaye the siluer and golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vessels thereof? The very same doth this man also: he robbed the mynisters of Gods house, and left destitute of due helpe. In like maner doth he: Truly they be better that are killed wyth the sword, then they which be pined with hunger: for they are dead straight, but these are wasted with the barrennes of the earth. O daughter, all they that passe by the waye, let them haue pitye and compassion on thee, for there is no sorrowe like thy sorrowe. For nowe thy face is blacker then coales through much sorrow and weepinge, and thou art no more knowen in the streates: thy foresayd ruler hath placed thee in darcknes, and hath giuen thee wormewood and gall to drincke. O Lord, heare the sorrowe and sighinges of thy people, behold Lord, and descende, for the hart of this foresaid man is more indurate then the hart of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao. For hee wil not suffer thy people to departe, excepte in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude onelye of thy hande. For he scourgeth them, not onely myse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablye vppon the earth, but also after theyr death he intendeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croche the goodes of Christians vnder the name and title to dye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate or making no will. Therefore let the chiualrye of Englande well remember, howe the Frenchmen in times past, directinge their greedy eyes on the Realme of England, laboured wyth all theyr po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer howe to bringe the same vnder their subiection. But it is to be feared, least the new deuises and practise of this newe ennemye, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that which hitherto hath beene lackinge in them. For in dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the treasury of the Realme, &amp; spoylinge the Churche goods: the Realme shalbe brought into such inability, that it shal not be able to helpe it selfe against the ennemye. Therefore O daughter and you the mynisters therof, suffer not your selues to be ledde any more into such myserable bondage. Better it is for the wealth of the &amp; thine, that the Christian kinge and the powers of the Realme which haue indued thee with greate benefites, &amp; you also which are indued with their benefites, do labour wyth all your power how to resist the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, conspiracies, arrogancye and pryde, of the foresayd person: who

He was so new fangled that he made much chopping and chaunginge, erecting and supplanting of bishoprickes, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes, and such like dignityes. He made two Thomasses Saincts, the one bishop of <hi>Hertford</hi> in England, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> a dominican, beside sondrye other. Hee ordayned that belles should be ronge thrise in the day, that the people fallinge on their knees euen as they go in theyr waye, shoulde saye <hi>Aue Maria</hi> thrise. He condemned them for obstinate heretickes, that defended that Christ and his Apostles possessed nothing priuatly, and sent commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Uniuersities that no scholers should presume to dispute therof. He condemned the wryting of one Peter a franciscan fryer, who wente aboute to encourage men to follow the pouertye of Christe, for the which thinge many were condemned &amp; burnte. He exempted the white fryers from all iurisdiction, reseruing them onelye to S.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode the Pope likewyse. Touching the errour &amp; grosse heresye of this Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> he was charged with it in the councell of <hi>Constance</hi> by these wordes: Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> sayde and stubbornely beleeued, that the soule of man dyeth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the body, &amp; is consumed to nothing like the soule of brute beastes: whereof he neuer would purge him selfe. Furthermore because that <hi>Thomas Vvalleis</hi> an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was imprisoned by the Pope for reprouinge his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye, the kinge of Fraunce sommoned a councell into his Pallaice in <hi>Viciana sylua,</hi> where the whole assemblye sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed against the Popes heresye: and therefore the kinge sent to Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> willinge him both to reforme his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye, and also to deliuer the prysoner, &amp; so the said <hi>Thomas</hi> was set at libertye.

                  <hi>Biginae</hi> to marrye, and detested pictures. He helde it for a grounded article that Christ gaue none other rule of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse to his Apostles then to other Christians, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles neuer vowed pouertye. <hi>Iohn Mandeuil</hi> in his first booke and seuenth Chapter, sheweth that this Pope wrote at large to the Greekes that there is but onely one Christian Church, and that he was head thereof and vicar of Christ, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Greekes aunswered briefely: <hi>VVee do assuredlye acknowledge your highe power ouer your subiectes, but wee cannot abide your high pride, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stanch your greedye couetousnes: the deuill is with you but God is with vs.</hi> Thus briefely in a worde they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed the Popes estate. This Pope condemned <hi>Lewis Bauare</hi> a noble Emperour, to be a rebell to the Church, a scismaticke and hereticke, because he toke vpon him by the Electours choyse the gouernment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empyre, not vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anye fealtye to the Pope. Thus wryteth <hi>Iohn Marius</hi> of this Emperour <hi>Lewis</hi>: Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> (sayth he) hated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death <hi>Lewis Bauare,</hi> partly because he beinge chosen by the estates of Germanye kinge of the Romaynes, did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to receyue at the Popes hand (according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Canon of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fifte) the name and title Emperiall, partly againe because he defended from the Popes power certaine monkes whom he had condemned for heretickes: therefore Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> auouched <hi>Lewis</hi> to be an hereticke. <hi>Lewis</hi> comminge into Italye, appointed his deputies in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Cittye and came to <hi>Millen</hi>: and because he desired to qualifye the Popes displeasure, he sent Embassadours to him kepinge his courte then at <hi>Auenio</hi> in Fraunce, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him the ornamentes belonging to the estate impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, with freindlye affection as his auncestours had done: the Pope did not onelye denye the sute, but sent awaye the Embassadours with great reproche, and cited the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour him selfe peremptory wyse (as they terme it) to come to <hi>Auenio,</hi> &amp; submit himselfe to the Canons of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:711:152"/>
The Emperour knowinge the Popes tyrannye vsed in his Church, &amp; vnderstanding that he had his estate giuen him from God, desired to keepe and defende the same holye and vndefiled: and therefore woulde not submit himselfe like a slaue vnto Popes, and so denyed to come to <hi>Auenio.</hi> And yet being desirous of peace, he besought the Pope by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours once againe, to bestowe on him with curtesye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ornamentes of the Empyre: the Pope stoode peuishlye in his wilfulnes, vaunting and boasting in his wrytings, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had power to playe make &amp; marre w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Princes, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at his pleasure he might set vp and depose whom he listed: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Empyre being voyde, the Pope is ful Emperour: And for malice against <hi>Lewis</hi> he exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated the Uicounts, whom the Emperour had appointed to gouerne <hi>Millen.</hi> The Emperour perceyuinge the Popes obstinate minde, taking with him many Princes of Italye came to Rome, and was honourablye receyued of al the people, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to the custome to receiue the solemnityes of the Empyre. The Romaine peeres and all the people sent Embassadours to Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> in Fraunce, and humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him to come to visit his City Rome, &amp; to bestowe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the king of the Romaynes the imperiall rites: which if he would not do, they said plainly that they them selues would keepe the ould law &amp; priuiledge of the Romaynes. <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing heard the Embassadours, vsing great threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and terrours draue them away with foule rebuke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. The Romaynes, seing this decreed to yeld to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Lewis</hi> his lawfull request: and so by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the clergy and people, both he and his wyfe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were crowned by <hi>Steue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> &amp; <hi>Nicolas</hi> being Senatours, in the meane time the nobilitye shouted oute, saying: <hi>God saue Lewis Augustus Emperour of the Romaynes.</hi> The Pope hearing this (though the Emperour did nothing but that was lawful and godly) did accuse him for a traytour, and an heretick: he published sore processe against him, put
<pb facs="tcp:711:153"/>
him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his estate imperial, depriued him of his kingdome, condemned him by vile and cruel curse of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, as a rebell and Captaine heretick againste the Church of Rome, by meanes whereof he enflamed all Christendome with such discord &amp; deadly warres, as could not afterward be quenched in thirty yeres. Thus farre wryteth <hi>Marius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Pope had nothing to defende his forged supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macye and auctoritye, but the dreadfull boultes of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. But there were certaine at this time as well deuines as lawyers, which preached that Christe and his Apostles did possesse nothinge properlye, and that the Emperour in temporall cases was not subiect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope: Amonge these men were <hi>Michael Coesenus</hi> &amp; <hi>VVilliam Occam</hi> minorites, <hi>Marsilius</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Iandane</hi> lawyers, with diuers other. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Emperour was so comforted by these, that he did stoutly withstand the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes ententes, and published this his appellation about the coastes of his Empyre.</p>

               <p>Thus when <hi>Lewis</hi> and the peeres of Rome perceyued well the iniquitye of Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the people of Rome from the hyest to the lowest, did take it in euill part that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Embassadours who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had sent were so mocked of him,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:711:153"/>
they all agreed together that the ould custome of chosing the Pope should be brought into the Church: that is, that he being chosen by the people of Rome, should be admitted and allowed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour. Therefore one <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baria</hi> a minorite was made Pope, and was called <hi>Nicolas</hi> the fifte: and as for <hi>Iohn</hi> they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded of him that he was an heretick, and a tyrant of the Church, not a pastour but a breaker of the common peace of Christians.

But because (as <hi>Volaterain</hi> sayth) almost all the Cityes reuolted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him (by the councell of <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> a Nonne of <hi>Scene,</hi> which afterward became a saint, &amp; of <hi>Baldus</hi> his scholemaster) he returned from Fraunce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rome with xii. galleyes. Or (as <hi>Sabellicus</hi> saith) because that he reprouing a certaine bishop for being nonresident, was by the same bishop reproued againe, that he being the chiefe bishop did yet lye so farre and so long from the place of his Church. <hi>Anno</hi> 1376. he excommunicated out of the Church the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who were the auctours of the reuolting, and had taken to their vse al the Popes townes lying about them: and because they despised and defyed the terrour and vaine boults of his excommunication, he war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon them. Some other saye he returned into Italye for other causes. <hi>Masseus</hi> sayth, that one <hi>Briget</hi> a woman
<pb facs="tcp:711:160"/>
returned from <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to Rome, wrote to Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> that it was the Lords pleasure that the Popes court should returne to Rome. <hi>Crantzius</hi> saith, it was because a certaine bishop did sharpelye rebuke him that he woulde leaue his Church and followe the Courte: Of whom the Pope receyued this aunsweare: And thou (quoth he) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge Pope of Rome that ought to be an example to other, doest not returne to this bishopricke. And therefore he did againe translate his seate from Fraunce to Rome, by the perswasion of two women and one bishop, in the 70. yeare after the translation thereof. This <hi>Gregorie</hi> demaunded tenthes throughout the whole Empyre, and repayred the walles of the City and old buildings with great pompous cost. He added the eue to the holye daye of the byrth of the blessed virgin Mary.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:711:160"/>
besought them to choose an Italian &amp; not a French man Pope, that the Courte mighte not go into Fraunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

Therefore on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye being the ix. day of Aprill, they choose <hi>Vrban</hi> the sixt to be Pope, who was Crowned on Easter daye being the xviii. daye of the sayde moneth. <hi>Praemonstratensis</hi> sayth that in the time of this <hi>Vrban</hi> the sixte, began a newe and straung sect of bedlams both of men and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who vsed to skip and daunce against all modestye: who <hi>Anno</hi> 1375. came (sayth he) from <hi>Aquisgran</hi> into <hi>Hannonia</hi> and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fraunce, which might prognosticate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> returne of Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> and his Cardinals to Rome.

<pb facs="tcp:711:161"/>
Likewise her husband the noble <hi>Otto</hi> duke of <hi>Brunswick</hi> and Prince of <hi>Tarentum</hi> offered him the like curtesy But (sayth <hi>Theodoricus</hi> of <hi>Nyem. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.) sone after <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> after dinner amonge many great estates and Cardinals drancke to the Pope, but <hi>Vrban</hi> was so proud that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the noble Prince to kneele before him a great while, ere he would take the cup out of his hande, in so much that one of the Cardinals moued withall sayd vnto him: Most holy father, it is time for you to take the cuppe &amp; drincke. Whereby he fulfilled the ould sayings: <hi>Asperius misero nihil est qui surgit in altu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And againe: <hi>Corde stat inflato pauper honore dato.</hi> Claw a churle &amp;c.

He warned the Cardinals diuers times to take heede of simonye, and to contente themselues with their porcions:
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:711:161"/>
he commaunded them to ryde wyth fewer horses, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> (quoth he) we maye euen from our hartes be a paterne to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and (quoth he) as touchinge that ye speake of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge into Fraunce, ye knowe that I will continue still in Rome.

               <p>
                  <hi>Theodoricus</hi> in the 33.

And yet the Pope woulde not rebuke his nephewe for this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanye, but beinge told thereof and of his licentious life, he vsed to aunsweare: Tushe he is a yong man. And yet saith <hi>Theodoricus, Butillus</hi> was at this time fourty yeres old.
<pb facs="tcp:711:162"/>
But vpon this fact there was a great murmuring among the people, saying y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like prancke was neuer played before in <hi>Naples.</hi> And yet the Pope did not onely defende his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe being for it condempned to death by the kinge, but also with crackes &amp; threates made the king glad to bestow a noble virgin of his owne bloud vpon the sayd <hi>Butillus,</hi> &amp; threscore and tenne thousande Florences yearely, with the castle of <hi>Luceria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> (as <hi>Stella</hi> sayth) was a crafty man, &amp; one that would remember an iniurye and seke to reuenge: <hi>Crantzius</hi> sayth he was a churlishe, cruell and vnmerciful man, who taking vpon him the Popedome, soughte not to make peace (as he should haue done) amonge Christians, but rather bent himselfe to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the iniuries of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals and of <hi>Iane</hi> Queene of <hi>Sicill,</hi> and therefore to make the <hi>Florentines</hi> to take his part, he absolued them from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excommunication of Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and sent <hi>Iohn Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuth</hi> an Englishma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> captaine of them against the Queene. Furthermore he being of nature giuen to wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gling, strife, &amp; cruelty, creating certaine new Cardinals at <hi>Nuceria,</hi> he cast vii. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old Cardinals into prison because they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with <hi>Clement</hi> the seuenth against him: and fiue of those vii. he layde vpon great stones, and in despite of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> drowned them, which kinde of death also one <hi>Adam</hi> an Englishman being a Cardinal did hardly escape at the same time. And of those newe Cardinals being xxix. they were all Neapolitans and his cosens, sauing three. This Pope proclaymed warre against <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gary</hi> king of <hi>Naples,</hi> because he woulde not make a nephewe of his Prince of <hi>Campania</hi>: he gouerned the Church with all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannye that might be, and to shewe his rigorous rage more openlye, thus wryteth his friende <hi>Platina</hi> of him: <hi>Vrban</hi> (sayth he) being deliuered from the terrour of Fraunce &amp; gone to <hi>Naples,</hi> desireth the king to make his nephew king of <hi>Campania,</hi> which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he could not obtaine, this fellow
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:711:162"/>
vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a iust and honest man, being one whom no man neither loued nor liked, began forthwith to threat and crake the king, whereby he so offended the kinge that for a while he commited him to the charge of certaine parsons, and suffered him not to come abroade. But the Pope dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling his malice for the time, departing with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings good will to <hi>Nuceria</hi> (because of the heate of the weather as he fayned) and fortifying the Citye sufficientlye, he doth both make newe Cardinals and imprysoneth seuen of the olde, because as he sayde they had conspired with the king and Pope <hi>Clement</hi> against him. Furthermore he sente out a processe against the king, and a citacion accordinge to the custome: the kinge aunsweared that he would shortlye come to <hi>Nuceria,</hi> and aunsweare his accusations both by word and by sword. So he came to <hi>Nuceria</hi> with a greate army and besieged the Citye, <hi>Ramond Balsian</hi> being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with this discurtesye, beinge Prince of <hi>Tarent</hi> presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his power, and conueying <hi>Vrban</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all his Court to the next shoore, he put them into three Galleyes of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newaies</hi> prouided for that purpose: wherby while the Pope is transported to <hi>Genua,</hi> he drowned fiue Cardinals faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to rockes, of those seuen which he toke at <hi>Nuceria.</hi> Furthermore in the yere after the death of <hi>Charles,</hi> he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to <hi>Ferentine</hi> (to see <hi>Naples</hi> as he sayde) but in deede of this minde, to depriue of their inheritaunce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yonge Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Ladislaus</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> being but a child, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonnes of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi> This <hi>Vrban</hi> graunted to the sect of begging fryers, that they might chaunge theyr vowes to commit another vnhonest act, and challenge as it were to restore to righte vnlawfull goodes being in controuersy. He dyed in Rome <hi>Anno</hi> 1390. poysoned as some thincke, after he had mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouerned the Popedome x. yeares, and fewe or none were sorye of his death. The yeare before his death his Mule fel vnder him as he was rydinge, where withall he was soore hurt and brosed, so as he did neuer recouer it til his death:
<pb facs="tcp:711:163"/>
he being dead, his nephewe <hi>Frauncis</hi> was thrust from all his lyuing, and came to Rome poore and despised no man shewing him good countenance, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old saying:
<q>
                     <l>Cum moritur praeful, cognatio tota fit exul.</l>
                     <l>When as a prelate goes awaye,</l>
                     <l>then all the kindred do decaye.</l>
                  </q>
And so this <hi>Francis</hi> with sorrowe and anguishe forsooke Rome at length and went to <hi>Sicill.</hi> This same yeare (sayth <hi>Funcius</hi>) this couetous miser <hi>Vrban</hi> brought vp the yeare of <hi>Iubelye,</hi> because he sawe it would proue gaineful to him and to the Romaynes. He also appointed annuities to be payed out of priestes landes, vnder pretence of waginge an armye against the Paganes: the Englishmen withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this constitution, calling a Parliamente did decree y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Pope should haue no iurisdiction beyonde the limits of the Ocian Sea: but the bishops &amp; prelats like traytours to their countrey, did take vpon them afterward to paye y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pention.</p>
               <p>It would aske a great volume to touche euery vilanous practise of this Pope <hi>Vrban.</hi> Certaine comming to meete him on a time did first kisse the ground three times, &amp; then his feete with al humility. He had giuen him by a certaine Ladye, a precious Miter and certaine garments valued at more then xx. Thousand Florences. He caused a Cardinal in one daye to depose, to racke, to tormente, to spoile &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison, all the prelates of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> because they did not mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger their Prince assist him against <hi>Clement,</hi> and made in their steede 32. newe bishops and archbishops: and (sayth <hi>Theodoricus</hi>) there was not a clarke in al <hi>Naples</hi> so del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishe and beggerly, but that he was made eyther a bishop, archbishop, abbot, prior, or some prelate, if he woulde take it vppon him to take part with <hi>Vrban.</hi> He vsed the seruice of <hi>Charles</hi> king of <hi>Sicill</hi> on a time going before him as his vssher, and bearinge the Popes target following with his armye into a towne called <hi>Auersa.</hi> He put sixe Cardinals
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:711:163"/>
in a dongion with their feete set in the stockes, and caused them to be myserably tormented and racked, onlye for sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of falsehoode against him, and so kept them in priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where they pined through famine, thirst and cold, hauinge also wormes and life breedinge in their bodyes: &amp; yet they stoode stoutly in their innocencye. But no humble and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate sute neither of them nor anye other, coulde euer moue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stonye hart of <hi>Vrban</hi> to pitye their cases, but (saith <hi>Theodoricus</hi>) the more he was entreated the more wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full he was, so that his eyes would sparkle, his face burne and glow, his throte waxe dry for anger. And after sondry examinations he sent vnto them againe <hi>Theodoricus</hi> (the writer of this historye) &amp; other to examine them in a vaute of the castle where they laye, then (sayth <hi>Theodoricus</hi>) the Cardinall of <hi>Sanger</hi> was first broughte vp vnto vs, with a paire of iron shakles on his feete and a short mantel about him, because it was a colde and windy prison. Who when he came to the ende of the cellar and sawe aboue him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes hanging wherewith he should be racked, and was by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wayters striped out of his apparell, leauing him scarcelye his shirt on, and bound very hard to the racke, <hi>Frauncis</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes nephewe stoode by and laughed at this miserable sight without all measure: but I that loued this Cardinal of ould was sore greeued thereat, but I could not departe the place. But to be short, the said Cardinall was an aged man of a corpulent bodye, comlye and taule of stature, and being bounde he was thrise lifted from the grounde by the stronge pulling of those that racked him, so that he waxed verye feble, which when I behelde, when hee was let go to the grounde againe I said to him softly: O deare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do you not see how your bloud is sought for: I beseech you for Gods cause confesse something to deliuer your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues for this time from these tormentours?

And I woulde to God this were graunted to me as a singuler benefite, that I hauing nothinge might begge my breade from place to place: but out alas, this trouble &amp; sorrow are iustly by Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fallen vpon me, because euen in this kingdom of <hi>Sicil</hi> I was so cruel an executor of the Popes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in deposing without fauour the archbishops, bishops, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, and other of the clergye without respect of age or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, hoping herein to haue pleased his minde. The next daye after this Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> called vnto him one <hi>Basilius</hi> to be chiefe tormentour of these Cardinals, which liked him verye well for hee was a malicious man and hated the clergye naturallye, and was a persecutour of God and his seruauntes, a notable pirate, and a plaguer of Christians whom he vsed to take captiue from his youth: at the first he lyued by theft and robbery, but when that fayled and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a begger, he sought succour of Pope <hi>Vrban,</hi> who not for deuotion but to obtaine a priorship of an hospital in <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacria</hi> made him a fryer.

And although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinall were an ould man, broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and diseased, and weake of complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet he tormented him vppon the racke most cruellye from morninge till dinner time continuallye, but the sillye man

euer as he was haled vp cryed stil &amp; saide: <hi>Christ hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for vs, &amp;c.</hi> In the meane time Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> walked in a garden belowe, and read on a booke so loude that wee mighte heare him, which he did to this ende that <hi>Basilius</hi> might the better loke to his charge to plong the Cardinal the mere. But as for me (sayth <hi>Theodoricus</hi>) I could abide this wofull sight no longer, and therefore dissembling my selfe to be sicke I gat leaue to departe. And in like maner was the other Cardinals vsed afterward. Finally <hi>Vrba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> remouing from <hi>Naples</hi> commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that these Cardinals and their fellow prisoner the bishop of <hi>Aquilo,</hi> should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe him and ride next after him, assigninge to euerye one his garde to keepe them that they should not escape by the waye. But the bishop partly because he roade vpon a iade, partly because his bodye was yet after his racking so sore and feeble that he was not able to endure faste riding, but as the Pope galloped he came lagging after as fast as he might. And yet the Pope thinking that helingred to haue stollen awaye, in a greate rage commaunded his villaines to kil him, and so they slew him mangling him with many woundes, and left his dead carkasse vnburied in the waye. Afterward at the sute of king <hi>Richard</hi> of England, Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> did partly release to the custody of a certaine priest one of the Cardinals called <hi>Adam</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Sicil</hi>: but he toke from him all that euer he had, and left him in case of a vagabounde till <hi>Boniface</hi> his successour restored him. But as for the other fiue he kept miserablye in prison in an abbey in a towne of <hi>Ianua,</hi> being next to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church where he laye: and if that he saw any man resort to that Church at extraordinary howers, he thought that he resorted the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deliuer the Cardinals by stealth: and therefore he committed to prison &amp; torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted many of his owne Court onlye vpon suspition therof. And notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke &amp; citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Ianua</hi> sued for those prisoners, yet he wold neuer shew them any mercy, but in the end caused them to be put
<pb facs="tcp:711:165"/>
to death, as some saye beheaded, other saye drowned, but how so euer it were sure it is they perished. Furthermore <hi>Charles</hi> king of <hi>Sicil</hi> being at variaunce with <hi>Vrban,</hi> and hauing his nephew <hi>Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis</hi> prisoner dyed at length. Then came <hi>Margaret</hi> the wyfe of the said <hi>Charles,</hi> humbly suing to <hi>Vrban</hi> to be gracious to her and to her children, and to graunt that her husbands body might be buryed, in which sute manye nobles of <hi>Florence</hi> and other Cityes ioyned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her, and yet his hard hart woulde nothing pittye her sute, nor grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t her so much as a graue for the king her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, thoughe she had freely released his nephewe to him, yet he added processe to processe, and heaped condemnation vpon condemnation against her and her poore children, because he did from his harte detest the name of the saide <hi>Charles.</hi> Thus reporteth <hi>Theodoricus</hi> word for word as he is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, whoe beinge Secretarye to Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> wrote that which he sawe with a sorrowfull hart. The cause whye that the Pope did dispatche those Cardinals was this: he was sodenlye forced to remoue from one place to another, and therefore thinking that those Cardinals if he shoulde carye them with him would hinder and comber him on the one side, &amp; on the other side he was loath to leaue them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind least they should escape, and therfore flying from <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceria</hi> to <hi>Ienua</hi> (as is sayd) it is thought that by the way he tyed them fast to the rockes, &amp; so lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

arose great howling, crying, &amp; lamenting through Rome.

Yea I saw then (sayth <hi>Theodoricus</hi>) certaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones of Rome desirous to enflame the Romaine Citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s against the courtiers &amp; strangers, to iastle them ruffiantly in the streates, and without al honestye to spit and slauer in the faces of the courtiers both of men and women.

When any aduocates during his gouernment moued any matter debated in his consistorye, he neuer vnderstoode them, but woulde bolte out an vndiscrete aunsweare to their demaundes. At the first during the liues of certaine good Cardinals he durste not openlye commit simonye, thoughe priuilye he vsed his brokers therein: but they being dead after vii. yeares he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it openly. First he toke the first fruictes of all abbeyes and great Churches voyde, and ere the lyuing were besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the money must be payed: yea often he was heard to wishe, that the money being payed the party might not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it, that he might be payd new first fruictes againe by a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother. This was the chiefest of those xxvi.

Thus the Pope played pollage so long till all men being weary of his mockery, his market decayed.</p>
               <p>A thousande other practises were put in vre by him and his clergye as appeareth at large in <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> and yet because the Pope did it, is was no sinne, for so they sayd ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallye.

When these and the former shiftes waxed stale, then the Pope and his complices deuised newe. They made newe grauntes of benefices which did disanull all the olde: but they were very deare, for they were sould for fifty dukates a peece, and they to whom the Pope graunted them, sould them with condicion that the sellar should haue porcion of the commoditye. And if one man had a benefice graunted him &amp; the graunte were written and sealed, yet if another came in the deede doinge ere it were deliuered and woulde giue more, the former seale was broken, the wrytinge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, and the graunte voyde, and so as often as the price was enhaunsed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gift was chaunged: yea they that made the former offers were rayled on, and rebuked bitterly by <hi>Boniface,</hi> charging them that they went about to beguile

him in bargayning, offering not so much as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefice was worth. At this time a contagious plague raigned in Rome wher of men dyed so fast, that (sayth <hi>Theodoricus</hi>) I haue seene one benefice sould to many men in one weeke, euery one paying the price for it and dying immediatly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother came by and by and gaue money for it, and so he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third did likewise.

Thus were al the Popes courtiers become bargainers, brokers, vsurers and simonistes: and he that could deuise the most crafty shiftes, was counted wysest &amp; most esteemed. Some hauing then a graunt to take for himselfe perhaps ii. iii. or iiii. of the benefices that he could espye next voyde, woulde by meanes of this commission cease vpon xx. and keepe the commoditye of them in his handes: they that vsed these shiftes were the Popes auditours, &amp; by this meanes they disapointed other men that had the like grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and thus they might do with pretence of law, because they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues being chaplaines and officers vnto Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi> Hereupon a rose manye suetes and controuersyes in law, so that the clients being wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully encreased in nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the proctours and lawyers would not plead but haue vnreasonable fees.

In the ende the fathers of the generall councell of <hi>Constance</hi> sent vnto him, that eyther he should come the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or send his messenger, and thereupon he sent <hi>Charles Malatest</hi> to be his proctour, who seinge them thus to be minded to put him from the Popedome, he stept vp into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes trone (being there for the purpose prepared) and comming downe from it againe, francklye gaue ouer the fourth day of <hi>Iulye Anno</hi> 1415. for the which free yelding the whole assemble made him Legate of <hi>Picene,</hi> which as soone as <hi>Gregory</hi> vnderstoode within a fewe dayes for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, griefe and anguish of minde, he dyed sodenlye.

Which dignitye being bestowed vpon him (sayth <hi>Platina</hi>) he was worthelye called <hi>Alexander,</hi> because he being before but a beggerly and begging fryer, might now be matched with the proudest Prince in Europe, for excessiue prodigalitye &amp; hautye courage. Wherupon he vsed to ieast merelye often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times saying: <hi>I am a rich bishop, a poore Cardinall, and a beggerly Pope.</hi> This Pope was of so stout a stomacke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he cast oute of his kingdome <hi>Ladislaus</hi> then most mightye king of <hi>Naples</hi> &amp; <hi>Apulia,</hi> who did conuert to his vse more conuenientlye the lordships of the Church being euil got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. To this wicked deposition of the Prince agreed all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> clergye and priestes of the councell of <hi>Pise.</hi> This beinge done, the Pope did most vnlawfullye bestowe it on <hi>Lewes</hi> duke of <hi>Andegania.</hi> The councell of <hi>Pice</hi> being dissolued this Pope went to <hi>Bononia,</hi> where <hi>Balthazar Cossa</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>S.

This man was confirmed Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate by Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> because that councell was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by his politicke deuise, and because he was the man who mighte best encounter and deale against such as durst at any time go about to gouerne the Ecclesiasticall estate. And this Pope (saith <hi>Platina</hi>) was more wild in maners, more saluage, more bould and more laymanlike then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his profession. His life was counted almost a warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:711:175"/>
he thought that souldiours and warrelicke prancks, and many other wanton toyes which are not to be named, became him well enoughe. Amonge other decrees this Pope made bulles for S.

And being now at the last gaspe, he said <hi>Anno</hi> 1411. in the viii. month of his Popedome: <hi>I protest by this death which I see to be at hand, all that was done at the councell of Pise was good and lawfull.</hi> After he had said this the company weeping and mourning, he breathed out very feebelye this sayinge of oure sauiour: <hi>I giue you my peace, I leaue my peace with you.</hi> Thus presumptuouslye durst he being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at deathes doare, take vpon him the power of Christ to giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace of Christ (being peace of conscience though he did not so vnderstand it) which he could neuer do.

For (sayth <hi>Stella</hi>) while he behaued himselfe in <hi>Bononia,</hi> more like a Prince then an Embassadour, and was liefetenaunt ouer a great armye, the elders meeting there to choose a new Pope, he threatned to trounce them terriblye, vnlesse they would choose him a Pope according to his minde, and thereupon many were broughte forth to him to be approued, but he woulde allowe none of them.

Hereupon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye said that such spirituall doues had long time beene the chiefe byrdes in the Church.

He returning to Rome was made <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberer</hi> vnto <hi>Vrban</hi> the sixt, which office he discharged with so great shew of humilitye and curteous nature, that <hi>Innocent</hi> the seuenth made him Cardinall. For in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersyes he woulde agree to neither parte, no not to the truer, but so keepe in a meane y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he pleased all, &amp; offended none. For this cause he was so in fauour with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Cardinals, that in the foresaide councell he was made Pope. At whose election the Emperour <hi>Sigismond</hi> was so ioyfull of it that he thanked them all for chusinge such a Pope, &amp; humbling himselfe to him kissed his feete. The Pope again embrasing him like a brother did thanke him on the other side, because his diligence had at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:711:178"/>
restored y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. After this salutacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted on his palfreye, his coronation being also ended w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great triumph he passed pompously (from the place where he was crowned) through the Citye of <hi>Constance</hi> with his horse trapped in skarlet, and all his abbottes and bishops in roabes and miters rydinge after him, &amp; his Cardinals wyth their horses trapped in white silke. But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour on the one side of the Popes horse, and the prince E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectour on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other side wayted on foote vpon him throughe the Citye. And yet soone after he conueyed himselfe away, and as (<hi>Volateranus</hi> sayth) maugre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours head, he returned in all poast hast into Italy. He passed through <hi>Millen, Mantua, Ferraria, Rauenna,</hi> and other townes til he came to <hi>Florence</hi>: but mistrusting daunger he shonned <hi>Bononia.</hi> He abode at <hi>Florence</hi> two yeares lyuing in all fleshlye pleasures, pompe and idlenesse, and preached not the Gospell so much as once. Furthermore while he was before at <hi>Constance,</hi> when the Emperour &amp; other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made often complaintes to him of naughty behauiour, and detestable maners of the clergye, he deferred the time to redresse it, saying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a matter that required both leasure and good aduise. For (quoth he as <hi>Ierome</hi> sayth) Euerye prouince hath his fashions and customes, which cannot be altered without much hurlye burlye. And nowe because it was feared, that the generall councels auctority should be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be aboue the Popes, he made this decree concerning councels, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none shoulde be sommoned againe till fiue yeares were expired, and then from that time it should be continued for ten yeares, and so from ten yeares to ten yeares the generall councell should be kept.

Of this man were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye Uerses and Epitaphes written to his greate prayse, &amp; bewayling of the tyrannye vsed toward his innocent body. Furthermore <hi>Eugenius</hi> ere he were Pope, did repayre S. Agnes Church at <hi>Ancon,</hi> and the gate of the Citye, and in his Popedome he Crowned <hi>Sigismond</hi> Emperour at Rome.

He following y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne his traine of harlots, and bestowed them on his fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and seruauntes. Beside he had his fee comming into his treasure of that moneye, which the harlots earned by
<pb facs="tcp:711:187"/>
their misdemeanour, to the enrychinge of his cofers: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strompets of Rome do yet paye theyr <hi>Iuly tribute</hi> (as it is termed) euery weeke to the Pope, which in yearely reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues hath oftentimes amounted to xx. Thousand ducates, and now by report ariseth to fourtye Thousande. And so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treasurers of the Church are bound to make accompte as well of harlots tribute, as of the Church landes.</p>

                  <hi>VVesselus Groningensis</hi> (called the light of the world) in the discourse of the Popes indulgences wryteth of this Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> that at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sute of the foresaid <hi>Peter</hi> then Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>S. Sixtus,</hi> and Patriarke of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and of his brother <hi>Hierome,</hi> he graunted the whole familye of the Cardinall of <hi>S. Lucia</hi> (who in his former yonge yeares had in like maner yelded himselfe to the detestable lust of Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the second) to file theyr bodyes lawfullye, in most vnlawfull, vnnaturall and vnspeakable maner for 3. hot monthes Iune Iulye and August, which he graunted with this clause: <hi>Fiat vt petitur,</hi> Doe accordinge to your requeste. O horrible and monstrons men, more saluage then brute beastes, weare it not but that malice of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi>
and the deuill (sparing no blasphemye to slaunder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Christe) dryueth me to detecte their loathsome treacherye and nakednesse, I would rather helpe to burye these villanyes in silence then to vtter these their filthines, which I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but with blushing remember.

                  <hi>Sixtus</hi> and his nephew, &amp; of <hi>Alphonsus.</hi> But as touching <hi>Sixtus</hi> (sayth <hi>Volateran</hi>) he being disposed to exercise him selfe in warrefare, wherunto he was of nature more encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then to religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, moued quarrels of warre as he might right or wronge.

It was his chiefe delighte to haue Christian Princes at commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whom at his pleasure he did both set vp and put downe: He set his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates the <hi>Heluetians</hi> with fyre and sworde vpon the <hi>Lombardes</hi> whom he had cursed, and gaue the <hi>Heluetians</hi> a pardon and an ensigne, to encourage them to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Lombardes.</hi> He aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced his cosins &amp; bastardes (to the shame of the Church) to all that he mighte: for he made two of his nephewes <hi>Leonarde</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> to be Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Citye by course one after another, beside other dignities diuers and many y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he bestowed on sondrye of his kindred, &amp; among other one <hi>Raphael</hi> his sisters sonne was made Cardinal. But one <hi>Laurence Medices</hi> honge vp the saide <hi>Raphael</hi> and <hi>Saluatus Pisanus</hi> and diuers other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had murthered his brother.

In the xv. yeare he celebrated the <hi>Iubelie</hi> for the encrease of his lucre and gaynes, and to pleasure his frendes. He diuised many polling &amp; bribing offices of scribes, abridgers, sollicitours, waighters, and notaryes of the escheaker, to enriche hys cofers, which offices are to be bought of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope. He made diuers newe holly dayes, and diuers Saintes, and manye

then of <hi>Melphit,</hi> afterwarde Secretarye by <hi>Sixtus</hi> and so came to be Cardinall, and last of all Pope. He was tall of stature, fayre of complexion and of a comly parsonage: but of a grosse and dull wit, voyde of learninge, and so heauye headed that sometime euen when he sate busye about pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affayres, he would take a nap and fall a sleepe. He was welbeloued of <hi>Sixtus</hi> for his comlye behauiour and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye, wherein he excelled all other. But verelye he fawned vppon all men with flatteringe face, but was freind to no man in deede: and being of nature addicted to couetousnes, yet he would shift it and colour it with myrth and pleasant ieaftes.

that a tribute shoulde be payed due vnto him, and that the rebels should haue no harme.

are not nothing abasshed in despite of God and iustice, to breake their leagues. And yet notwithstandinge this the Popes power, yet kinge <hi>Charles</hi> preuayled in his purpose maugre their hartes and came to Rome, where for feare least he should by violence breake awaye from himselfe to their greater damage, the Pope co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that he should be curteouslye let in, and that none of the Romaine soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours vpon paine of death should make any sturre, and so did <hi>Charles</hi> likewyse commaunde his armye. And yet the cowardlye Pope wyth a bande of men fled dastardlye into <hi>Angel</hi> castell: but after he perceyued that quietnesse was kept in the Citye, he maketh a league with <hi>Charles,</hi> se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding home to <hi>Alphonsus</hi> his souldiours againe.

Ioyning therefore the successe that Christe hath giuen to his Gospel, with the shaking of Antichriste his kingdome foreshewed by the spirit of God, it shall not be amisse to take these signes as witnesses that God sheweth hereby that he is mindefull of his promise made to his elect, that the dayes are at hand when Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must fall, and our Sauiour Iesus Christe come againe in glorye to the subuerting of him.

He besieged <hi>Rauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> cruellye, and in the ende preuayling made it subiecte to his Empire.

This councell was called the yeare 1511. the xix. day of Maye, to beginne in September next following. The cause hereof is sayde to be, because the Pope had broken his oath and for sworne himselfe: for notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he had raigned so many yeares, yet contrarye to his oath they could get no hope of hauing a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell.

They haue growen to this height (as he sheweth) by three meanes, by excommunicating, by geuing pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; by the sword. Furthermore in his discourses vpon the fift decade of <hi>Liue</hi> Cap. xii. he sheweth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contempte of Religion is cause of the ouerthrow of al common wealthes, &amp; namelye that the occasion both of discorde and euill successe in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, is because that Religion is contemned, whereof there can be no greater coniecture (saith he) then that those people which are nearest to the Church of Rome, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heade of our Religion, haue least Religion. And he that by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience would know the truth of this matter, (if he were of sufficient power and auctoritye to transport the Court of Rome into <hi>Zwitzerland,</hi> where onelye at this daye the people do liue both according to Religion &amp; warlicke sort of antiquitye) he should perceiue that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> detestable demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

By playing the bawde he first got to be made cardinal. He deliuered his sister <hi>Iulia Farnesia</hi> vnto <hi>Rodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus Borgia</hi> a Spaniard, otherwise Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt, wherby he might obtaine of him to be made cardinall and byshop of <hi>Hostia,</hi> and so gat money to pay his debtes.

Furthermore this vnnaturall and wicked Pope <hi>Paule</hi> coulde not with holde his mischeuous hande from his owne kinred, no not from the wombe that first gaue him breath and life: for he poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned both his nephew and his owne natural mother, that he might therby enioye the whole inheritaunce of the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesians.</hi> Beside this he liued carnally wyth another sister that he had: and because he perceyued that she loued other better then him (which in the ende the harlot shewed open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye) his iealouslye was such, that to reuenge the despite as he counted it, he so watched his oportunitye, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende he poysoned her for it.</p>
               <p>He beinge Legate vnder Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the seconde in the prouince of <hi>Ancona,</hi> did villanouslye beguile a noble yong gentlewoman of the same Citye.

Thus doth God giue them ouer to their owne lustes that presume vpon themselues, &amp; thus doth he detect the man of sinne, suffering him to come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fulnes of iniquitye: who neuerthelesse is so blinded in his owne fantasyes, that wallowing in this wickednes, he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth yet himselfe to be perfite holye, and the generall Ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of Christe vpon earth. Yea &amp; for so much as he is able to forgiue vnto other (as he thincks) greater sinnes, if grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter maye be then these are, why maye he not dispense wyth himselfe in the like: Or rather why shoulde it be counted sinne in him. For so sayth one <hi>Ennodius,</hi> to speake but of one among many such sayinges: <hi>The Pope together with the power of teaching, hath receiued free libertye to do ill without controlment.</hi> And such is their affiaunce in the holines of their chaire, that the presumption thereof hath caused them thus to decree: <hi>Distict.</hi> 40. <hi>Non vos in Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa Papa de homicidio vel adulterio accusari non potest: vnde sacrilegij instar esset disputare de facto fuo Nam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Papae excusantur vt homicidia Samsonis, furta He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeorum, adulteria Iacob.

               <p>O what a miserable estate is this, that he who cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth himselfe to be the vicar of God (that is ielous ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least sinnes, and a seuere reuenger of iniquitye vppon his owne elected people) should thus against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiestye of that God as it were in defiance of his iustice, wincke at such an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible treacherye and suffer it to be vnpunished, which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes and heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> led onely by the light of reason haue loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed. Yea euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brutishe beast taught of nature co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth not, and as I maye plainlye say, if the deuil himselfe hath any remorse to be touched wyth the hydiousnes of sinne, I am sure he would detest &amp; abhorre such an acte most of all, If anye man be so vaine to repose his Religion vpon man, and to measure the truth of doctrine by the conuersation of the person, (As many misled by Popishe traditions refuse the sinceritye of the Gospell for the corruption of them y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> professe it): If those kinde of parsons loke vppon this one Pope (a mightye piller of their Religion) I hope they would roote out that affiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in his doctrine which is pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their breastes, or els be taught to measure the power and truth of the Gospell, not by the frailtye and weaknes of man. But if this waywarde reason be so beaten into their braynes that it cannot be digged oute, but that they will still affirme the doctrine is not true, and saye: I wyll not accept of it because the professours thereof are wicked men, Then let them beholde this Pope <hi>Paule</hi> a mightye patrone of their vndoubted Religion, and they shalbe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by their reason to say and speake with their tongue as the foole sayd in his hart: <hi>Surelye there is no God, no Iesus Christe, no holye Ghost, no Gospell, no heauen nor hell: I will not beleeue anye such thinge, because that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope himselfe the great professour hereof is become a sincke of sinne, and a puddle of all filthines, to commit in his owne parso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adulterye and incest, and to foster those
<pb facs="tcp:711:207"/>
euils in his sonne, and suffer him to be as it were Prince of Sodom. &amp;c.</hi> Thus (I say) if a man wil iudge Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by men, he shall be so farre from attayning to the knowledge of God &amp; from faythfull seruinge of him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he shall rather defye vtterlye his glorious maiestye, &amp; thincke that there is no God at all. But thus we see y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as no people haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned so much to the true vnderstanding of God, as they to whom it hath pleased y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercye of the father to reueale him selfe by his sonne Iesus Christe: so againe no people haue at anye time swarued farther from his holye wil and pleasure, and bin more fowlye polluted &amp; stayned with all kinde of abhominable wickednes. But to returne to the historye of <hi>Peter Aloysius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This outragious villanye against the sayd bishop toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other matters of iniurye, extorcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; crueltye, but this chiefelye, emboldned diuers parsons of all estates to grudge his doings. And amonge other he being on a time at his owne Citye <hi>Placentia,</hi> sone after this former facte <hi>Anno</hi> 1547. he did cease into his owne hands al the goods of sondrye parsons, and amonge them one <hi>Ierome Palaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> and when as he to auoyde the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of displeasure fled to <hi>Crema</hi> a towne subiect to <hi>Venice, Peter Aloysius</hi> apprehended the wyfe and children of the sayd <hi>Ierom,</hi> and imprysoned them all. This being a matter wherof grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trouble might ensue, the Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> bearinge good will to the <hi>Fernesians,</hi> wrote his letters to <hi>Aloysius</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> behalfe of <hi>Ierom,</hi> but <hi>Aloysius</hi> gaue him a lighte aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. Afterward <hi>Octauius</hi> sonne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayd <hi>Peter,</hi> came from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours campe to <hi>Trent</hi> purposing to returne home: The Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> came vnto him and coulde him the whole matter touchinge <hi>Ierom,</hi> and desired him to be a meanes to his father for him. Hee made him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to do it: and afterwarde sente woorde to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall that <hi>Ierom</hi> shoulde be receiued into fauour if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe woulde come and craue his owne pardon in humble
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:711:207"/>
manner. But because it was feared that promise beinge broken, he shoulde be put to some greuous punishmente, therfore the Cardinall with a trayne of men went to <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and called for <hi>Ierom.</hi> He mistrusting treason, would not appeare tyll he had good proofe that the Cardinal was come in deede. After they had longe talked in counsell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the Cardinal had at large promised his helpe, they toke their iourney together: The Cardinall sent one of his men before to geue knowledge to <hi>Aloysius</hi> that hee and <hi>Ierom</hi> were comminge, by whom <hi>Aloysius</hi> returned this message contrary to that whiche his sonne <hi>Octauius</hi> had shewed before, that if they came he coulde not restore <hi>Ierom.</hi> And although that bothe diuers Legates, besides other wise and graue men, did bothe intreate and vse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions to appease his wrath, yet he persisted obstinately in his purpose: And now certaine of the nobilitie that had hated him for his former pranckes, conspired to murther him. They hauing entertayned for their purpose certaine ruffians for their sauegarde, watched a conueniente tyme for theyr purpose, and being garded with this their traine, they diuidinge them selues into diuers companies, came now and then out into the streates, euery man pretending that it was done for priuate quarrels towching him selfe: and therfore euery man demaunded of those whom he had hyred to attende on him, whether they woulde faythfully take parte with him to reuenge his iniurie, whiche he had susteined at the hands of Duke <hi>Aloysius</hi>: the seruing men made aunswere againe that they would do their endeuour not onely to reuenge an iniurie on hym, but further, if it were to kill him.</p>
               <p>About this time, Pope <hi>Paule</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third wrote to his sonne Peter <hi>Aloysius,</hi> willinge him to take heede to him selfe, and to beware of the tenth day of September, for he saide that the starres did thretten great mischiefe towarde him: for this Pope by constant reporte was skilful, not onely in
<pb facs="tcp:711:208"/>
                  <hi>Astrologie,</hi> but also in <hi>Necromancie</hi>: vpon the sighte of these letters <hi>Aloysius</hi> was very sad and pensiue for feare. And when the same tenth day came, he passed out of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell, being borne in a horselitter, and accompanied with a great trayne, to viewe the fortifiyng of the citie, which he had appoynted to be doone: The conspiratours were also there in a redinesse, but because they coulde not then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine their purpose, therfore they made no slurre at al, but when he shoulde returne home, they gaue attendaunce on him, and as it were for duetie towarde him, they went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him .xxxvi. in al, and when he with his horselitter was entred into the castell, forthwith they drewe vp the bridge after them (for it was a drawe bridge) so that none other coulde follow them in: where, euen presently they set vpon hym with their swordes, and after they had rated him and vpbrayded him bitterly with his tyranny, they slew him in his litter, and a certaine prieste, beside the groome of his stable, and fiue <hi>Germaines.</hi> This beinge doone, they ran vp and downe in the castell, and made spoyle of al thinges, where among other things they founde an hewge masse of money, which he had laide in store to mainteine the charge of fortifiyng the citie. In the meane time the people of the citie ran thither, demaunding what the matter should be, because they harde such criynge, weeping, and howlinge, within the castell. The murderers spake out to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, saying. we haue slaine the tyrant and recouered the libertie of our citie. But because that matter could hardly be credited vpon the warrant of the people, promisinge to saue them harmelesse, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murderers tyed the deade body of <hi>Peter Aloysius</hi> to an iron chaine, and so hong him out ouer the castel wall, in sight of all the people, and after they had there let him hang a while, they threwe him downe into a dike. As sone as he was downe, the people ranne thither, drew him out, stamped on him and spurned him with their feete, and thrust their daggars into his bodie, so desirous
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:711:208"/>
they were to woorke their mallice on his hatefull carkasse. This being done, the people forthwith submitted them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to the obedience of the Emperour, to whom they vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the shameful demeanour of <hi>Aloysius</hi> and causes of his death, as hath ben saide. Thus he whom the Pope his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fostred in his villanie was plagued, both with losse of life in his own person, and alienation of his dominion from his children.

After the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="232"/> had iarred many a day about the election, in the ende this man was chosen the seuenth daye of Februarie, in the yere of our lord 1550. This <hi>Iulius</hi> because he was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy fellowe, and one that hated from his hart the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> was admitted into the colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles, by the former Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the third, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident for the Pope in the counsell of <hi>Trent,</hi> againste the <hi>Lutheranes.</hi> As sone as he had the Popedome he renewed the <hi>Iubelye</hi> to make moneye for himselfe. And therefore there repayred apace to Rome minstrils, pipers, harpers, fidlers, players, ieasters, iuglers, ruffians, bawdes, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots and Sodomites, with all kinde of rascall people. The Papistes conceyued a great hope that this <hi>Iulius</hi> woulde reforme Religion &amp; clergye according to their desire. But his delight was to feede like a glotton. Peacocks, porke and bacon and all kinde of swines flesh were his ordinarye fare that he most desired. He promoted none so soone to ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall dignityes as yonge and wanton <hi>Ganymedes,</hi> especiallye one of that sorte called <hi>Innocentius</hi> in whom was no good qualitye. Beside that with his detestable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges did staine the Popes Pallaice, he was as wicked in
<pb facs="tcp:711:209"/>
his wordes: for in his talke he was so vnciuill and such a ruffianlye ribauld and blasphemer, as amonge all the var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets in Italye was not a worse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pantaleon, Vergerius, Sleidan</hi> and other late wryters do report this of him that followeth: <hi>Anno</hi> 1550. the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth daye of Februarye <hi>Iohn Marie</hi> of the mounte after great wrangling among the Cardinals was chosen Pope and called <hi>Iulius</hi> the third. And because this newe Pope might bestowe his Cardinals hat by custome one whom it pleased him: he made one <hi>Innocentius</hi> a boye whom hee fansied carnallye aboue measure while he was Legate at <hi>Bononia.</hi> Against which deede al the Cardinals much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined and cryed out on it, yet the Pope did it and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more made him his companion in his house. But to rifle this matter farther modestye will not suffer, it is better to ouerpasse both the rumours and talke of the people tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it: and those abhominable speaches where with the Pope himselfe was neither afraide nor ashamed to ieast of his owne villanye, &amp; to displaye it openlye. Neyther could any honest eares endure to heare the contentes of certaine leud amorous letters fraught with all kinde of ribauldrye and wantonnes, which one <hi>Camillus Oliuus</hi> companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua,</hi> wrote to one <hi>Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niball Cotiuus</hi>: there loathsome letters being in their vulgar tongue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in most dishonest and amarous verse, were intercepted the same day that the Pope was chosen, the Cardinals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in the consistorye. These rimes were copied out and seene of diuers both in Italye &amp; Germanye, who reported of them that they neuer saw such detestable, vila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and abhominable wrytinges. By this the Reader maye iudge with what spirite this Romishe clergye is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued in whom lyeth the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ his vicar (as they saye.) But so farre they are from beinge (as they boast) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from sinne, that these treacheryes are common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them, and by theyr owne shamelesse tongues and

pennes detected to all the worlde, which gaue occasion to one <hi>Velteius</hi> to write this Epigram of Rome.

                     <l>Roma quid est? Quod te docuit preposterus ordo,</l>
                     <l>Quid docuit? Iungas versa elementa, scies.</l>

                  </q>
Touching the making of that boy <hi>Innocentius</hi> Cardinal, <hi>Vergerius</hi> sayth thus: Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> purposed to make a certaine lad called <hi>Innocentius</hi> Cardinal. This boye was not onelye of very base parentage, &amp; endued wyth no good qualitye, but also was one of vile life and euill behauiour. Therefore when the Pope propounded the matter to the Cardinals and euery one stoode against it, one of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals more boulde then the rest saide to the Pope: Sir I praye you what do you see in this yonker, that you woulde thus honour him with the scarlet roabe? To whom the Pope said againe: And I pray you what did you se in me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you should thus aduaunce mee to this pontifical dignitye? And therefore as this is the game of Fortune y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she should aduaunce whom it pleaseth her, so ye haue promoted mee vnworthelye: and so let vs I pray you promote this boye and create him Cardinall.</p>
               <p>Because that <hi>Paulus Vergerius, Bernardus Ochinus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hieronimus Marius</hi> did inueigh against the monstrous blasphemyes &amp; horrible treacheryes of this Pope <hi>Iulius</hi>: therefore he suborned <hi>Ierom Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ius</hi> to defende and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine these things in publicke bookes. And auctorised him by his bulles not onelye to apprehende these reprehenders of the Popes treacherye and Sodomitrye, but also that he should by his wrytinges defame &amp; slaunder with all kinde of bitter and dispitefull reproch, the Cittyes and Princes of Germanye. Thus may euerye man see how the bishop of Rome doth not onelye fall into this filthie sinne, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so defende them and vpholde them as well and lawfullye done euen in open wrytinge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:711:210"/>Furthermore the said <hi>Vergerius</hi> in a certaine wrytinge amonge other thinges sayth this: Where as the name of Pope <hi>Iulye</hi> the third is foulye tainted with this former of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and in such sort that he refrayned not from his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals &amp;c. I haue hyther to forborne to detecte his doinge touching this notorious enormitye. But seing euery man doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantlye report that he doth ordinarilye vtter those same kinde of blasphemyes that vile bauds and other such leude parsons are wonte to vse in contempte of God: men ought rather to condemne such an ouglye monster and not Christians &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the time of this Pope <hi>Iohannes Casa</hi> a <hi>Florentine</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Beneuentum,</hi> Deane of the Chamber Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall, and in all the Dominions of <hi>Venice</hi> the Popes Legate with full power and auctoritye did flourishe. This <hi>Iohannes Casa</hi> wrote in the commendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and abhominable filthines of <hi>Peter Aloysius,</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth with most loathsome wordes, flourishing Reto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke and wicked eloquence in Italian rime, that matter which is not to be named among men: yet he hath so pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and commended it as no man withoute sinne maye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte.

               <p>Such was the tyrannicall rigour of this <hi>Iohannes Casa</hi> against the professours of the Gospell, that one <hi>Franciscus Spiera</hi> a lawyer for feare of his crueltye did reuolt from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospell &amp; subscribe to the Pope, but vpon the same deede he fell into desperation and so continued a most myserable

man to his death tormented in conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paulus Vergerius</hi> did also hardlye escape the rigorous hand of this <hi>Iohn Casa.</hi> But to be short it were a tedious thinge to declare at large all the demeanour of this Pope <hi>Iulye</hi> the thirde in the time of his <hi>Iubelie,</hi> and in the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine</hi> councell in establishing the idoll of <hi>Lauret</hi>: and in his quarell &amp; braule with the bishop of <hi>Armin</hi> comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his house for one peacocke, &amp; other such like trifles. For he delighted much in the eating of peacocks and swy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes fleshe: but when his Phisitian had giuen him warning that he should forbeare swines fleshe, because it was hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goute his disease, yet <hi>Iulius</hi> would not forbeare. The Phisition therefore gaue councell to the Popes Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to take order that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope should haue no such meate serued at the table. Whereuppon the Pope wantinge his dish asked, What is become of our bacon? The Steward aunswered that the Phisition willed him that hee shoulde not set it on. The Pope forthwith violently brast into these wordes sayinge: Fetche me my meate hether <hi>Al di spetto di Dio</hi> as he might say in English, In spite of Gods hart. This blasphemous outrage is a common phrase amonge ruffians and varlets of Italye in their rage, and as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> as to other, beside other lasciuious and vnciuill speach. On a time he had at his table a peacocke which was vntouched, and therefore he commaunded that it should be kept for him til Supper: for I wil (quoth he) haue certaine of my freindes with me at supper in my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. When supper time came the Pope was serued with hot peacocks, but his cold peacocke came not in according to his commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: And therefore he began according to his custome to blaster out his blasphemyes raginge and raylinge. One of the Cardinals that sat at the table sayd: I beseeche your holines not to be so highlye offended for so small a matter: No? (quoth <hi>Iulius</hi>) If God were so offended for one apple that he threw our first parentes out
<pb facs="tcp:711:211"/>
of Paradise: why shoulde not I that am his Uicar be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye for my peacocke, seing a peacocke is of greater valew then an apple.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Iulius</hi> caused this sentence to be printed on his coyne: <hi>Gens &amp; regnum peribit quod mihi non inseruit.</hi> That nacion and kingdome shall perishe which doth not serue me.</p>
               <p>When he shoulde create one <hi>Peter Betauus</hi> Cardinall, certaine of the Cardinals stoode against it, vrginge especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye that the sayd bishop was infected with <hi>Luthers</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye: What then quoth the Pope, were it not better for vs by putting on him the Cardinals hat to purge him of that vncleanes, and by that bonde to knit him vnto vs, rather then to suffer him by escaping from vs to ioyne wyth oure ennemyes in Germanye as <hi>Vergerius</hi> hath done.

And yet this Pope was he whose auctoritie and suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was with all humilitie and deuoute reuerence restored here in England in the yere of our Lorde 1554. by queene Mary. From this man Cardinal Poole, who before was outlawed and vanished for high treason against king <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the viij. came into England, and brought with him this Popes blessinge, pardon, and absolution. For the whiche Cardinal Poole was made Primat of England and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byshop of Canterbury. Thus the Popes blessing and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don was receiued by the estate of Englande. And <hi>Ponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> in his cronicle published <hi>Anno.</hi> 1572. printed in <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uany</hi> by <hi>Iohn Fowler</hi> an Englishman, that blotteth much paper to publishe grosse vntruthes, for the defamynge of his countrey by him forsaken, is not ashamed <hi>Folio</hi> 179. to reporte, but boastingly writeth it, that kinge <hi>Phillip</hi> and Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> with the whole Parliament house did humbly kneele vpon theyr knees to receiue the Cardinals blessinge and absolution from the Popes holynesse. But it is well known, and the knowledge therof dearely bought by Englande, how that noble Queene being otherwise of great wisedome, and godly minde, yet ouermuche decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by ignorance in scripture, and putting too great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Popes autoritie, the antiquitie of her religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:711:212"/>
and the professours therof, did euen of simple zeale yeld the disposition and orderinge of her affayres ouermuch to the crafty clergie, who with fyre and faggot followed in England the rygorous example of <hi>Iuly</hi> practized in <hi>Italy,</hi> against those that dissented from the Popes doctrine. But this is both at large set forth in the actes and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church, and further is not pertinent to this purpose, and therefore not here to be mentioned at large: Onely this is that whiche I note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to what kinde of person of lyfe and conuersation England in these later dayes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it selfe as to his generall Pastour, and the vicar of Christ. Of what maner of man we receyued blessinge and absolution so deuoutly, whom we did so highly commend, honour, and reuerence, aboue our natural prince with hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenly title of our moste holy father the Pope. To whom and to whose seruile yoke our prynce dyd yelde her selfe to be at his commaundement, whose curse we feared, whose loue and fauour, we sought to purchase with infinite trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, whose displeasure caused bothe prynce and people to quake as it were at hel fyer. If the person that thus blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs be considered, I doubte not but we shall firste be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of him, secondely ashamed of our selues, that we haue thus fallen downe and worshipped the beast, and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally hereafter detest him and his successours.</p>

               <p>This being done, the kynge and the Queene and all the rest went to the Chappell, and chaunted <hi>Te deum</hi> for ioye of this sweete blessyng of so holy a Pope. It maye be that those burgeses and the rest of the Parleame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t house, at the time of this absolution, thought better of his person when they receyued his blessing: but I wyshe those that are yet remayning of them, and reade this his lothsome life, now to consider what a stinking idoll they honoured ignorantly at that time, and what a villains blessing they receyued so deuoutly. Consider also what benefittes euery way follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed this blessynge: for sone after there fell so great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of raine (as thoughe the heauen had bewept our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie) that the aboundance therof raysed great and pery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fluddes, doinge muche harme in diuers places: The Thames swelled so high, that for the space of fower or fiue dayes boates and barges rowed all ouer saincte Georges fielde, and so at Westminster a boate mighte haue rowed from one ende of the Hall to the other. Also that yere and the yere following there raigned hot burning feuers, and diuers other straunge and newe disseases so contagiously, that many people perished in all partes of Englande, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the most auncient and graue men, for in London betwene the .xx. of October and the last of December ther dyed seuen Aldermen: Also the yere followinge there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sewed a great dearth and famin throughout all England: And agayne the yere after that, Newenam bridge, Ryce

banke, Callice, Hammes, and Guynes were taken by the Frenchmen, and the Englishmen driuen cleane out of that parte of Fraunce, to their perpetual damage, which they had so long enioyed before: Ad vnto this also, that where as Queene Mary prouided a sufficient power to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported for the rescewe hereof, whiche mighte haue saued it, there arose such terrible tempestes of windes and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continuing foure or fiue dayes, vntill such time as the Frenchmen had wrought their purpose, and the English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the meane time by meanes of the terrible tempest were kept of mauger their hartes: and such shippes as did aduenture the passage were so shaken and torne with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of weather, as they were enforced to returne with great daunger, with losse of all their tackle and furniture. Finallye euerye thinge wente so to wracke, that (as it was thought) the noble Prince Queene Mary seing her Realme so to go to decaye, conceyued such an inwarde sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe of minde that by reason thereof aboute September she fell into an hot burninge feuer, which sicknes also was common that yeare throughe all the Realme, and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a marueylous nomber (as <hi>Grafton</hi> noteth) both no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, bishops, Iudges, knightes, gentlemen and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and in the ende the Queene dyed thereof and also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinal in one day, the 17. day of Nouember <hi>Anno</hi> 1558.

                  <hi>Marcellus Ceruinus</hi> was borne at <hi>Mount Publican</hi> in the field of <hi>Florence,</hi> who when he had well studied huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitye, began to be a scholemaister. Afterward when Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the third had created <hi>Alexander Farnesius</hi> (his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe by his bastard sonne <hi>Peter Aloysius</hi>) Cardinall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a boye, he made this <hi>Marcellus Ceruinꝰ</hi> his schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister. But sone after <hi>Alexander</hi> the Cardinal leauing his learninge and forsaking his booke, addicted himselfe wholly to other affayres, wherein both he and Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the third vsed the seruice of <hi>Marcellus</hi> as of their Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarye. When the bishopricke of <hi>Nicaster</hi> fell voyde he was
<pb facs="tcp:711:214"/>
created bishop thereof, but yet he liued still in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court &amp; as a retchlesse <hi>non reside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> repayred not to his Church at all. Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the thirde appointed the foresaide Cardinall <hi>Farnesius</hi> to be Embassadour to the Emperour &amp; to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> being both in <hi>Bulgarye:</hi> but because he was as then but a boye, he ioyned in commission with him this <hi>Ceruinꝰ</hi> to direct the whole order of the Embassage. At that time the Emperour and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> were moste busye to make warre against the Turke, which matter they moued ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlye. But <hi>Ceruinus</hi> did then publishe a booke which is yet extant in print, wherein he shewed that they ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to set vpon the <hi>Lutheranes</hi>: and that they were more detestable then any Turkes. <hi>Paule</hi> created him Cardinal when he was absent, &amp; sone after sending for him to Rome againe, he ordered all thinges by his aduise. He gaue him the title of the holye Crosse in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> also he made him generall Inquisitour of heresye and commissioner w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cardinal <hi>Burgensis,</hi> whereby much crueltye and vntolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dealing was vsed. When an Embassage shoulde be sent to the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councell, Pope <hi>Paule</hi> ioyned to Cardinall <hi>de Monte</hi> and to Cardinall <hi>Poole,</hi> this <hi>Cerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> as third in Commission. The first of these was sent as a man cunning in the Law, <hi>Poole</hi> was sent as one that did desire to haue reformation in the Church, although it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared afterward y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he neuer wished it in his harte. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye <hi>Ceruinus</hi> was sente as one in whom the Pope reposed all his trust. Therfore he charged him especiallye that he should suffer nothing to be spoken in the Church, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> should tend any waye against the maiestye of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Rome. And therefore when one <hi>Iames Nachiantes</hi> bishop of <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Possa</hi> saide that he could not allow the decree, wherein it was written that <hi>Tradicions ought to be receiued and kept with as holy affection and reuerence as the Scripture and Gospell, Ceruinus</hi> procured that he was driuen from the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell. Furthermore because one of <hi>S. Dominicks</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:711:214"/>
order called <hi>Don VVilliam</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> said in the councel, that the councell of <hi>Constance</hi> was aboue the Pope: <hi>Ceruinus</hi> called him to him and taunted him verye bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. But when the monke aunswered that the thinge it selfe woulde testifye it to be so, that the councell was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Pope, because the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell deposed him, <hi>Ceruinus</hi> aunswered that it was not so, but that the Pope gaue ouer of his owne accord, for proofe wherof he could shewe a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den bull: and so he charged him to be packinge forthwith out of the councell. Aboute that time <hi>Paulus Vergerius</hi> bishop of <hi>Iustinople,</hi> who had serued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea of Rome in son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye Embassages in Germanye, came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Mantua</hi> to this <hi>Tridentine</hi> councell. But because he was vehementlye su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected that he fauoured the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> in some pointes, yet the two other Cardinals <hi>Poole</hi> and <hi>de Monte,</hi> &amp; with them <hi>Tridentinus</hi> &amp; <hi>Paciecus</hi> were contente to allow him to sit with them least they should bewray that the councell was not free for euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they should exempt this <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerius</hi> being so wel knowen in Germanye. Yet <hi>Ceruinus</hi> would not be quiet vntill he sawe him put out. Manye of the bishops when they sawe how it was purposed to driue <hi>Vergerius</hi> out of the councell, did determine to write to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope thereof &amp; to admonish him not to suffer it to be done, because manye would saye it was not a free councell from whence bishops were forced to depart. <hi>Hierom Vida</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Alba</hi> an eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t man had penned the letters in his owne name and the rest of the bishops, When <hi>Marcellus</hi> heard thereof he charged <hi>Vida</hi> with sore woordes, that he shoulde not in anye wise sende those letters to the Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sayinge, it was an euill example that bishops summoned in councell should write such letters to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, as though they woulde appointe him what he should do, which was a matter so haynous, that the suspicion therof were to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded. <hi>Vida</hi> and the other bishops being terrifyed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, suppressed their letters and sent them not.
<pb facs="tcp:711:215"/>
                  <hi>Vergerius</hi> when he shoulde departe out of the sinode came to <hi>Ceruinus,</hi> and demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of him for what articles espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye he would haue him cast out from the companye of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other bishops? <hi>Ceruinus</hi> aunsweared him saying: because I haue hard that thou deniest that the Legendes of <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> and <hi>S. Christopher</hi> are true. So it is (quoth <hi>Verge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>) I haue denyed them &amp; do still denye them to be true, emboldning my selfe herein by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auctoritye of Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the thirde: for when he commaunded both these Legendes to be taken out of the Breuiary, he sheweth in that preface that he commaunded that onelye such Legendes should be razed as were not true. <hi>Ceruinus</hi> being thus entangled, made aunswere that they were not to be counted good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which would agree with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Lutheranes</hi> in any one point, &amp; therefore auaunt out of our councell. Such was the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of this <hi>Ceruinus</hi> against the Gospell, and yet he was one voyde of all knowledge in diuinitye, but peuishe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But otherwyse he was a man of good discretion, of verye honest life, and of great wysedome, and therfore he was had in great estimation and reuerence, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if he might haue raigned Pope, it was to be hoped that he would haue reformed many thinges in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court of Rome, &amp; especially that he would haue eschewed all royotousnes. And so it came to passe for Pope <hi>Iulye</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third being dead <hi>Ceruinus</hi> was chosen Pope. But wheras he was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sicke of the yelowe iaundise, then the disease began to woorke so sore vpon him that he died the twentye daye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the election. The report was that he was poysoned but there was no such thing. A litle before he would haue bin crowned but with moderate coste. Cardinall <hi>Farnesius</hi> wyth his freinds in election gaue his voyce to this man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had long before had a brawle with him, because he hoped that no man would more diligently aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him as <hi>Paule</hi> the thirde did determine. But especiallye he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that he would maintaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house of <hi>Farnesia</hi> that they

Before his Papacie he publy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed a booke concerninge reformation of the Churche, but in his raigne he regarded it not.
