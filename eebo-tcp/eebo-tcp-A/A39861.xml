         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE to the READER.</head>
            <p>THERE is nothing more established by Consent of all the <hi>FATHERS,</hi> than the Respect and Veneration which <hi>Christians</hi> ought to have for the <hi>WORD OF GOD,</hi> and the Care wherewith they ought to search into it, for the Rules of their <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as those <hi>Holy Men</hi> were all acquainted with the depth of the <hi>SCRIPTURE,</hi> which is so full of <hi>Mysteries,</hi> veiled under <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Parables,</hi> they have made some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between these <hi>Divine Works,</hi> which are not all alike intelligible, tho' all equally <hi>Holy.</hi> Wherefore they supposed, That the <hi>Historical Books,</hi> which represent to us the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and the rest of those admirable <hi>Saints,</hi> that had an <hi>Apostolical Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> so many Ages before the <hi>Apostles,</hi> were very proper to awaken our <hi>Piety,</hi> and instruct us by <hi>Examples,</hi> proportion'd to the Capacity of the meanest <hi>Believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis upon that account St. <hi>Basil</hi> tells us, <hi>That the</hi> Scripture <hi>(in recording the</hi> Lives <hi>of the first</hi> Saints, <hi>doth set before us so many living and animated</hi> Pictures, <hi>for a</hi> Rule <hi>to direct ours by.</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> (for the same Reason) being desirous to teach his <hi>Auditors</hi> the Duties of a <hi>Christian Life,</hi> made it his Business to expound the whole <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Genesis</hi> to them in his <hi>Sermons.</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> also wrote several excellent <hi>Discourses</hi> upon the <hi>Lives</hi> of the principal <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> to make <hi>Christians</hi> blush, who having before their Eyes the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of our <hi>Saviour JESUS CHRIST</hi> so divinely described in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> are notwithstanding less Followers of him, than those who lived so many Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and when the Face of the whole <hi>Earth</hi> was covered with the Darkness of <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In imitation therefore of those <hi>Holy Teachers</hi> it is, that we again set forth the <hi>Lives</hi> of those very <hi>Saints,</hi> whom they have recommended with so many <hi>Elogies in</hi> this <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>the History of the Old and New Testament.</hi> They are here represented in short; but yet so, that care has been taken to deduce at large whatsoever was most proper to touch. the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and to inspire them with the Sentiments of <hi>Piety.</hi> And to the end this <hi>Work</hi> might be more proportion'd to the Capacities of all, and the <hi>Instructions</hi> it contains, made more useful by illustrating them with something that's pleasing, <hi>These Holy Histories</hi> are represented in <hi>SCULPTURES,</hi> accompanying each <hi>Discourse,</hi> which are generally concluded with the Explications of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as containing most excellent Instructions for <hi>Christians,</hi> whatsoever State or Condition they are in.</p>
            <p>He who applies himself a little to the reading of the <hi>Book,</hi> will soon be convinced of its usefulness. He will find excellent Patterns for <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> for <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> for <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and in a word, for all such as desire to lead a true <hi>Christian Life:</hi> And therefore St. <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>That from the</hi> Patriarchs <hi>we may take the perfect Models of all Vertues:</hi> Abel (saith he) <hi>teaches us Innocence;</hi> Enoch, <hi>Purity of Heart;</hi> Noah, <hi>Perseverance in Righteousness;</hi> Abraham, <hi>the Perfection of Obedience;</hi> Isaac, <hi>Chastity in Wedlock;</hi> Jacob, <hi>Constancy in Labour;</hi> Joseph, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of Injuries;</hi> Moses, <hi>Meekness towards the most Obstinate and Rebellious; and lastly,</hi> Job, <hi>an invincible Patience in the height of all his Sufferings and Afflictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Scripture</hi> is read alone, it is not so easie for all Men, to draw from thence the edifying Instructions those <hi>Holy Histories</hi> contain; but here without pains they will find them applied to every <hi>History,</hi> being carefully gathered from the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Authors</hi> Thoughts at first were, to set down the very <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in <hi>Scripture,</hi> in a different <hi>Character;</hi> but they were oft found too prolix to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the small space which was left after the Relation of each <hi>History;</hi> neither would
<pb facs="tcp:63323:5"/>
they have had that brisk and lively Brevity, which is so necessary to Reflexions upon an <hi>Historical Discourse:</hi> Therefore he was obliged to abridge them; yet so, as to preserve all the Essential Terms, and exactly to express their Sense, without tying himself to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Words.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reflexions</hi> of the <hi>FATHERS</hi> upon the Examples and Words of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> are the more considerable, because they tell us, That they thought themselves obliged on these occasions to lay open, and apply the greatest Truths with all possible force and evidence. To this purpose St. <hi>Austin</hi> expresses himself in these following remarkable Words; <hi>When we converse with you</hi> (saith he to his Auditors) <hi>at other times, we rather bear with you, than instruct you; but when we are in this Holy Place, and expound to you the Books of GOD, in case the Truths we propound to you seem too smart, the necessity which lies upon us of expounding the Scripture, will plead our Excuse for the Liberty with which we represent what GOD himself speaks to you. If the Word of GOD doth astonish you, so it doth me; I am as apprehensive of its Threats as you are, and whilst I speak those things that make you tremble, I am affected with the same Passion my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Reader</hi> possibly may observe in the Sequel of the <hi>Book,</hi> that some of these <hi>Figures</hi> are not well chosen, and that some <hi>Histories</hi> are left out, which seem no less considerable than those set down; but this can be no prejudice to the whole Body of the <hi>Work,</hi> and the Sequel of these <hi>Discourses,</hi> care being taken to link them together as well as possible, without regard had to the <hi>Sculptures,</hi> many important Matters being touched at in the <hi>Reflexions</hi> which are not represented in the <hi>Sculptures,</hi> and chiefly to enlarge on these Circumstances of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> from whence the <hi>Fathers</hi> have drawn their Edifying Observations, which is the main End of this <hi>Work</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Margin</hi> is added the Years from the <hi>Creation</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and those before our <hi>Saviour;</hi> which are to be understood according to the common Computation of the Years from the Birth of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been thought fit to add the <hi>Contents</hi> or <hi>Summaries</hi> of the several <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> that the <hi>Reader</hi> might have an <hi>Idea</hi> of the whole; as also that in those <hi>Books</hi> where <hi>Sculptures</hi> and <hi>Discourses</hi> are more rare, or altogether omitted; that Defect may be supplied, by giving a short Account of the Matter therein contained.</p>
            <p>At the end of the <hi>New Testament</hi> is Printed, as an <hi>APPENDIX,</hi> the <hi>Lives, Travels,</hi> and <hi>Voyages</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> with the <hi>Contents</hi> of each of their <hi>Books,</hi> as also an <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Chronology;</hi> in which, if the <hi>Reader</hi> cast an Eye, he will without trouble discern the Order of the <hi>Time,</hi> and the Sequel of all these <hi>Histories.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no reason but to hope, that the <hi>reading</hi> of this <hi>Book</hi> may make some Impression on the Hearts of those who desire nothing more than their advance and growth in <hi>Piety;</hi> because <hi>Truths</hi> ought never more to affect us, than when <hi>GOD</hi> himself teaches us them in his <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> and when the <hi>Holy Men</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> (full of his <hi>Spirit</hi>) do from them point out to us the way to <hi>Heaven,</hi> which he has traced out for us in the <hi>Lives</hi> of those <hi>Saints</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and which he hath Sealed in the <hi>New</hi> with the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> himself.</p>

                  <head>The Terrestrial Paradise, and Neighbouring Countries. With a brief Discourse of the TRAVELS of the PATRIARCHS, From <hi>ADAM</hi> to <hi>JACOB.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Eternal GOD</hi> having out of Nothing created the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Seas,</hi> and all things therein contained; He formed <hi>Man</hi> according to his own Image, and so dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and honoured him, that he made him Lord over the <hi>Fish</hi> of the Sea, the <hi>Fowls</hi> of the Air, and the <hi>Beasts</hi> of the Earth, and every Creeping thing therein; and gave him for his habitation the <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>Eden,</hi> call'd <hi>Paradise,</hi> which for its beauty, pleasant situation, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, surpassed all the <hi>Countries</hi> on the face of the Earth; and therefore rightly call'd, <hi>The Garden of Pleasure.</hi> It was situated in the Land of <hi>Shinar,</hi> a Province in <hi>Asia,</hi> upon the River <hi>Tigris,</hi> which in Scripture is called <hi>Pison:</hi> This River divides it self into four Branches, and each hath its particular Name.</p>
                  <p>Now the better to make out the true situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Garden,</hi> we must remember that <hi>Moses</hi> saith in <hi>Genesis,</hi> Chap. 2. vers. 8. That <hi>God</hi> had planted a <hi>Garden</hi> in <hi>Eden,</hi> Eastward; and in the 10<hi>th</hi> Verse, That a <hi>River</hi> went out of <hi>Eden</hi> to water the <hi>Garden,</hi> and thence divided it self into four Heads; that is, into four great <hi>Channels,</hi> or Capital <hi>Rivers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a certain demonstration, that it was situate Eastward of <hi>Pison,</hi> being the only River that water'd it, and retain'd that Name; and tho' one part of the <hi>Garden</hi> extended West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yet <hi>Adam</hi> had his abode in the Eastern quarter, as appears by <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. where it is said, <hi>Adam</hi> being driven out, God placed <hi>Cherubims</hi> at the East of the <hi>Garden,</hi> to hinder him from entring in again. And (according to <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 16.) it is related, That <hi>Cain</hi> went forth from before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and inhabited in the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> which lay to the East of <hi>Eden;</hi> and that which renders this the more credible is, that this <hi>River,</hi> for its breadth, depth, and rapid Stream, (excelling the <hi>Rhine,</hi> or the <hi>Danube</hi>) must needs have hindred our <hi>First Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> from going out of the <hi>Garden</hi> Eastwards, if they had their habitation in the Western part thereof, since they had neither <hi>Bridge</hi> nor <hi>Boat,</hi> to cross over the River; for the <hi>Scripture</hi> speaks not a word of either<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor makes the least mention of any way they had for <hi>Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> before the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Noah.</hi> Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that several Ancient <hi>Geographers</hi> have been very much mistaken, in placing the <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>Eden</hi> to the West of <hi>Pison.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>River</hi> (as aforesaid) is divided into four Heads or Branches, <hi>viz.</hi> two to the North, or above the <hi>Garden;</hi> and two to the South, or below the <hi>Garden;</hi> and were call'd, <hi>Pison, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon, Hiddekel,</hi> and <hi>Euphrates:</hi> And thus they are described in <hi>Genesis,</hi> Chap. 11. ver. 11, 13. and 14. The name of the first is <hi>Pison,</hi> and this compasseth the whole Land of <hi>Havilah,</hi> where there is Gold; the name of the second River, is <hi>Gihon,</hi> the same is that which encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth the whole Land of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> the name of the third River is <hi>Hiddekel,</hi> which goeth towards the East of <hi>Assyria;</hi> and the name of the fourth, is <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Euphrates</hi> takes its sourse from the <hi>Mochian,</hi> or <hi>Caspian</hi> Mountains, situate in <hi>Armenia</hi> the Great; the <hi>Hiddekel</hi> begins its course from a certain Lake seated at the first rising of Mount <hi>Ararat:</hi> These two Streams fall down together, and joyn in <hi>Pison,</hi> at the Upper-end of the <hi>Garden,</hi> which having washt, they separate again at the Bottom thereof, where the more Eastern part retains the name, and the more Western is called <hi>Gihon;</hi> hence they run towards the <hi>Persian Sea,</hi> into which they empty themselves.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>First Parents</hi> being placed in this <hi>Garden</hi> of Pleasure, had the free use of all things, except the Tree of Knowledge of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> Gen. 2.17. which was strictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them by God; telling them, That in the day they eat thereof, they should die the death: But the <hi>Devil</hi> envying the happy condition of <hi>Man,</hi> stirs up the <hi>Serpent</hi> to tempt <hi>Eve,</hi> to taste the Fruit of the said <hi>Tree;</hi> telling her, That they should not <hi>dye;</hi> but that their <hi>Eyes</hi> should be opened, and be as <hi>Gods.</hi> With these sly Enticements and Lies of the <hi>Serpent, Eve</hi> was prevailed with to eat thereof, and gave it to <hi>Adam</hi> to eat also, who was also infatuated to Transgress <hi>God's</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and so fell by their Disobedience into <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Destruction,</hi> and were driven out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and condemned to get their Living by the Sweat of their Brows; and for their Transgression the <hi>Earth</hi> was accurs'd, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63323:7"/>
caused to abound with <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Thistles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, they had their Habitation on the East of <hi>Paradise,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> which was also called <hi>Susiana,</hi> and at this day <hi>Susan;</hi> where they employed their time in cultivating the Earth; and had two Sons, the elder named <hi>Cain,</hi> who was a Tiller of the Earth, and the younger named <hi>Abel,</hi> who was a Keeper of <hi>Sheep,</hi> and was murthered by <hi>Cain,</hi> as being transported with hatred against him. <hi>Cain</hi> being severely reproved, and accurst by God for this bloody Crime, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the heinousness thereof, falls into great despair and perplexity of Mind; and fearing lest every one that met him should kill him, goes forth from the presence of <hi>God</hi> into the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> and there builds a City for his security, and calls it <hi>Enoch,</hi> after the Name of his first Son: Upon the Ruins of this City it may be presumed, that the Town of <hi>Susan</hi> was afterwards built, as being situate near <hi>Eden,</hi> Westward of the Mountains of <hi>Ararat,</hi> and upon the River <hi>Euleus,</hi> called <hi>Ulac;</hi> where <hi>Cain</hi> was palpably stopt in his flight from the Presence of the Lord, as not being able to pass over this River.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Men</hi> increasing more and more in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, were at last overtaken by Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, in the Year of the World 1656, by the <hi>Deluge,</hi> which drown'd all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon the face of the <hi>Earth,</hi> except <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>Family,</hi> and those <hi>Creatures</hi> which <hi>God</hi> caused to be taken into the <hi>Ark,</hi> for the replenishing the Second World. This <hi>Ark</hi> having floated up and down on the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (above the highest tops of Mountains) for the space of about five Months, it pleased the LORD to let it rest at last upon the Mountains of <hi>Ararat;</hi> and after that the Waters were sunk, and retired into their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, faithful <hi>Noah</hi> (and all that were with him in the <hi>Ark</hi>) went out, and betook themselves to the East of the River <hi>Hiddekel,</hi> from whence the Posterity of <hi>Noah</hi> disperst themselves East and West, denominating from their Names, the several <hi>Countries</hi> where they took up their habitations; and therefore we can do no less than adjoyn here their <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the better adjusting the Names of the Countries set down in the <hi>Map</hi> with those of the several <hi>Families;</hi> and making out the more distinctly where each of the Descendents of this <hi>Patriarch</hi> planted themselves, with their <hi>Families,</hi> according to what we find in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Annotations</hi> upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Noah</hi> had three Sons, <hi>Shem, Ham</hi> (or <hi>Cham</hi>) and <hi>Japhet.</hi> The Children of <hi>Shem</hi> had for their Portion, the more Southern part of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> the Posterity of <hi>Ham</hi> had the Land of <hi>Canaan, Arabia, Egypt,</hi> and all <hi>Africa;</hi> and the Children of <hi>Japhet</hi> had <hi>Europe,</hi> with the North parts of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sons of <hi>Shem</hi> were <hi>Elam, Assur, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaxad, Lud,</hi> and <hi>Aram. Elam</hi> was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Elamites,</hi> that is, of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Lands of <hi>Susiana, Elymais,</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> Dan. 8.2. where the Prophet saith, that <hi>Susa,</hi> or <hi>Susari,</hi> seated on the River <hi>Ulai,</hi> is a City in the Lands of <hi>Elan;</hi> where (according to <hi>Strabo</hi>) the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchs kept their Courts, as being the Imperial City of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Monarchy, and was reckon'd 15 <hi>Italian</hi> Miles in circuit.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Assur</hi> the <hi>Assyrians</hi> were descended, whose chief City was <hi>Nineveh,</hi> once a City of great Fame, first built by <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and afterwards so enlarged by several succeeding Kings, that it became at last to exceed <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> as well in largeness as otherwise, its Walls being in circuit 60 Miles, in height about 33 Yards, and in breadth about 24; for its defence were on the Walls 1500 <hi>Turrets,</hi> or <hi>Towers.</hi> To this City the LORD sent <hi>Jonah</hi> the Prophet to preach Repentance to them; but afterwards (for their Sins) it was destroy'd by <hi>Astyages</hi> King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> out of whose Ruins was built <hi>Mosul,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Assyria,</hi> seated on the <hi>Tygris,</hi> of Note for being the Residence of the <hi>Nestorian Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,</hi> where are founded fifteen <hi>Christian Churches:</hi> It is enclosed with a Wall, and is the Residence of a <hi>Basha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>Arphaxad</hi> descended the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> called <hi>Casdim,</hi> who was the Father of <hi>Selah,</hi> and he of <hi>Heber,</hi> who gave name to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> this <hi>Heber</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Peleg</hi> and <hi>Joktan; Peleg,</hi> because in his time the World was divided into Colonies; of <hi>Peleg</hi> was begat <hi>Rehu;</hi> of <hi>Rehu, Serug,</hi> of <hi>Serug, Nahor;</hi> of <hi>Nahor, Thare;</hi> and of <hi>Thare, Abram, Nachor</hi> and <hi>Haram,</hi> and <hi>Abram</hi> had <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Isaac, Jacob.</hi> From <hi>Nachor</hi> sprung <hi>Uz, Buz, Chemuel, Aram, Chesed, Hazo, Pildas</hi> and <hi>Bethuel,</hi> who was the Father of <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Rebecca;</hi> and from <hi>Haram</hi> sprang <hi>Lot. Joktan, Arphaxad's</hi> second Son, had a large Issue, <hi>viz.

                  <p>From the Land of <hi>Ophir, Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Ships</hi> brought <hi>Gold, Precious Stones,</hi> and other rich Commodities, performing their Voyage in Three years, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.26. and 10.12, 22.

                  <p>Here he met his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> who came against him with 400 Men, nevertheless they Embraced each other, and parted Friendly, <hi>Esau</hi> to his Dwellings in the Mountain <hi>Seir,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> passing the River <hi>Jordan</hi> went from <hi>Succoth,</hi> and took his Habitation near <hi>Sichem</hi> in <hi>Canaan;</hi> and after the Murther of the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> upon the account of his Daughter <hi>Dinah,</hi> Gen. 34. he came to <hi>Bethel,</hi> and there built an <hi>Altar</hi> unto the LORD.

                  <p>We find here also the beginning of the <hi>Worlds Restauration,</hi> after the severe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Deluge;</hi> the Original of <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> the first Promise of the <hi>Calling</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the beginning of the first <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;</hi> the Confusion of <hi>Languages;</hi> and the <hi>first Genealogy;</hi> in which <hi>Moses</hi> his principal Aim was, to set forth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment of the <hi>Church,</hi> which proceeding from the small number of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family, and afterwards continuing for some time in that of <hi>Shem,</hi> fell at last totally into <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and though <hi>Melchisedek,</hi> and his <hi>Family,</hi> were some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Remains</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> yet it pleased <hi>God</hi> to select one particular <hi>Family</hi> for himself, from amongst all the Posterity of <hi>Shem,</hi> to distinguish them from all other <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and to sanctifie and consecrate them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose, of his meer Mercy he chose <hi>Abram</hi> and his <hi>Posterity,</hi> having called him to leave <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> where he served <hi>Idols,</hi> to go to <hi>Canaan;</hi> promising him (amongst other Blessings) That the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> should be born of his <hi>Seed,</hi> and making a <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, ratifying it by the Mark of <hi>Circumcision.</hi> After which <hi>Isaac</hi> was born to him, in whom his <hi>Seed</hi> was to be called; and not in <hi>Ishmael,</hi> who was born to him by <hi>Hagar,</hi> or the Children born to him by <hi>Keturah,</hi> After <hi>Sarahs</hi> Death.

                  <p>From <hi>Isaac,</hi> the Inheritance of the <hi>Promises</hi> passed to <hi>Jacob,</hi> to whom the <hi>Birth-right</hi> was designed by <hi>God,</hi> as well as sold to him by his elder Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> and ratified to him by his <hi>Father's blessing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>Jacob</hi> it passed to his Posterity, as appears by his Prophetical Blessing of his <hi>Sons.</hi> And <hi>God</hi> having chosen this <hi>Family</hi> to himself, maintained them in the Truth of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and Purity of his <hi>Worship,</hi> governed them by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected them against their Enemies, exercised them with many <hi>Afflictions,</hi> comforted them under their <hi>Sufferings</hi> with his secret <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,</hi> and rescued them by unexpected <hi>Deliverances:</hi> Not but that many <hi>human Infirmities</hi> appeared sometimes in the best of them, which God graciously pardoned for the sake of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whom they embraced with a true and lively Faith, accompanied with true and serious <hi>Repentance.</hi>

                     <p>Thus they were expelled out of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious place, to lament their <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> in the other parts of the <hi>Earth:</hi> In which they saw every where the sad effects of their Rebellion; they remembred the Happiness they were formerly possest off; and being sensible of the Misery they had brought upon themselves, this Melancholy Comparison of their <hi>former</hi> and <hi>present Condition,</hi> (which they could make then by their own woful Experience, much better than we can now) cast them into a deep <hi>Sorrow.</hi>

                     <p>In the Year of the <hi>World</hi> 1556, and before <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> 2448, <hi>GOD</hi> ordered <hi>Noah</hi> to build an <hi>Ark,</hi> and withal told him exactly all the <hi>Measures</hi> and <hi>Proportions</hi> it was to have, to the end, that at the time of the <hi>Flood</hi> he might save himself therein with his <hi>Family,</hi> and the other <hi>Creatures</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> should send unto him.</p>

                        <hi>Noah</hi> did all according to the LORD's Command.

                     <p>
                        <hi>GOD,</hi> who never punisheth <hi>Men,</hi> but with a kind of regret and reluctancy, gives always some Tokens and Assurances of his Mercy, even when he is most in wrath and anger: Therefore we may discern here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That all his design (in forewarning Men of their future Ruin, so long before it fell upon them) was only to make them prevent it by their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                     <p>Thus he does still now-a-days under the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi> and that more plainly than ever he did before, invite <hi>Men</hi> to <hi>Repentance,</hi> by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting unto them the certainty and severity of his <hi>Judgment</hi> hereafter upon all <hi>Impenitent Sinners;</hi> and if <hi>Christians</hi> do slight his Threats and Warnings as <hi>Men</hi> did then, the multitude of <hi>Offenders</hi> cannot secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from <hi>GOD</hi>'s just Punishment.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Flood</hi> is a plain and dreadful Proof, that <hi>GOD</hi> will not spare <hi>wicked Men,</hi> tho' all were so; and that after we have long neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Offers of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> he will at last deliver us into the Hands of his severe <hi>Justice.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> have observed, that this <hi>Ark</hi> (wherein <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>Family</hi> was saved from perishing with the rest of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>) was an express Figure and Type of the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the sole <hi>Ark</hi> wherein we may find a sure <hi>Refuge</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> and out of which there is nothing but <hi>Destruction</hi> and <hi>Perdition</hi> to be look'd for. The vast Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that Building which was carried upon the <hi>Waters,</hi> and the gathering and mixture of all sorts of <hi>Beasts</hi> Clean and Unclean, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present and signifie the extent and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Church</hi> throughout all the <hi>World;</hi> as also the calling and gathering of so many <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> differing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by the diversity of their <hi>Ways, Customs,</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> whom <hi>GOD</hi> (who will have all Men to be saved) would one day gather up together, and bring into that <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> to save them from the terrible <hi>Flood</hi> of his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Wrath</hi> and <hi>Vengeance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Water</hi> do represent two great Mysteries of our <hi>Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> The <hi>Water</hi> signifies our <hi>Baptism,</hi> which cleanseth us from our <hi>Sins,</hi> as the <hi>Flood</hi> did purge the <hi>World</hi> from all its <hi>Abominations;</hi> and the <hi>Wood</hi> signifies the <hi>Cross</hi> of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> who by his <hi>Meritorious Death</hi> upon it wrought the <hi>Redemption</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, that this <hi>Cross,</hi> this <hi>Death,</hi> this <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> is still the sole Object of the Hope of all good <hi>Christians,</hi> who expect no <hi>Salvation</hi> but from the infinite Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Christ's Cross</hi> and <hi>Passion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>GOD</hi> was pleased to give a Figure of his <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Ark,</hi> which was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument he made use of to preserve his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> and to renew the <hi>World.</hi> We can never shew our selves thankful enough to <hi>GOD</hi> for his infinite Mercy in bringing us into the <hi>Ark</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> to save us from the general and dreadful Flood of <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Impieties,</hi> which prevail in the <hi>World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may indeed in that <hi>Ark</hi> (according to the <hi>Ancient Father's</hi> Observation) be subject to some <hi>Fears,</hi> be obnoxious to some <hi>Troubles, Evils,</hi> and <hi>Scandals;</hi> but however, there is no other Refuge against <hi>God's Vengeance,</hi> no other <hi>Sanctuary</hi> than that <hi>Ark;</hi> so that those that do not belong to it, shall infallibly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in the <hi>Floods</hi> of his <hi>Eternal Indignation.</hi>

                     </p>

                        <hi>Noah,</hi> by this <hi>green Olive-Leaf,</hi> understood that the <hi>Waters</hi> were abated; then he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Covering of the <hi>Ark,</hi> and saw that the <hi>Waters</hi> were dried up from off the Face of the <hi>Earth:</hi> And after he had received an Order from GOD, to go out of the <hi>Ark,</hi> wherein he had continued a whole Year, he went out with his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and all other <hi>Creatures</hi> that were therein.</p>
                     <p>The first thing <hi>Noah</hi> did after his going out of the <hi>Ark,</hi> was to build an <hi>Altar</hi> unto <hi>GOD,</hi> and to offer unto him upon it an Offering of every Clean <hi>Beast,</hi> and of every Clean <hi>Fowl,</hi> in thanks of his favourable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of him amidst of that Universal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the <hi>World.</hi> GOD accepted of his <hi>Offering,</hi> and promised to <hi>Curse</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> no more for <hi>Mans</hi> sake: He blessed <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>Children,</hi> and commanded them to multiply, and to replenish the <hi>Earth:</hi> He promised them, that the Fear of them should be upon every <hi>Beast</hi> of the <hi>Field,</hi> and upon every <hi>Fowl</hi> of the <hi>Air;</hi> he gave them an absolute Dominion over them, and over the <hi>Fishes</hi> of the <hi>Sea;</hi> nay, he gave them leave then to eat the <hi>Flesh,</hi> which was never granted to <hi>Man</hi> before the <hi>Flood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He made an Eternal <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Noah,</hi> and his <hi>Children,</hi> and establish'd the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> as the <hi>Sign</hi> of it; to the intent, that when ever it should appear in the <hi>Clouds,</hi> he might remember his <hi>Covenant</hi> with them, and prevent a second <hi>Inundation</hi> of the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> over the <hi>Earth.</hi> He hath always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred it accordingly, and there was never seen (since the first <hi>Flood</hi>) any thing like it in the <hi>World;</hi> tho' there have often been as many, and as great <hi>Crimes</hi> committed by <hi>Men</hi> upon the <hi>Earth,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But GOD is faithful to his Promises; he hath contented himself of having once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted visibly his terrible <hi>Vengeance,</hi> in inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that general Punishment upon all <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> that were then, living upon the <hi>Earth;</hi> to shew, that it is always in his power to punish <hi>Sin,</hi> and to extirpate <hi>Sinners;</hi> tho' he seldom now inflicts any other than invisible Pains and Torments upon them.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Rainbow</hi> is to us, a Security of his <hi>Goodness</hi> to us; and he charges us in his <hi>Word,</hi> to bless and praise him whenever we see it.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AFter the <hi>Curse</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> was taken off from the <hi>Earth,</hi> and that <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>Children</hi> began to breath and recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, of all the <hi>Miseries</hi> and <hi>Dangers</hi> they had undergone and weathered, by <hi>GOD</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Providence</hi> over them; there was an Action committed in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family, which plainly shewed how far the <hi>Corruption</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> can go, and how ineffectual even the consideration of <hi>GOD</hi>'s most dreadful <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> proves in the restraining of it, and in making <hi>Man</hi> wise.</p>
                     <p>Of the three Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> who had been so wonderfully preserved with him in the <hi>Ark,</hi> to re-people the <hi>World;</hi> there was one of them, who having deserved the <hi>Curse</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> drew also the <hi>Curse</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> upon himself, and instead of being the <hi>Head</hi> of an <hi>Holy Race,</hi> was the <hi>Father</hi> of so wicked a <hi>Posterity,</hi> as was to be the Object of <hi>GOD</hi>'s Anger and Reprobation.</p>
                     <p>It is observed by <hi>Moses,</hi> that <hi>Noah</hi> (after the <hi>Flood</hi>) began to be an <hi>Husbandman;</hi> and that amongst other Improvements which he made of the <hi>Ground,</hi> he planted a <hi>Vineyard:</hi> But it hapned, that drinking of the <hi>Wine,</hi> without being aware of its intoxicating Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he fell into <hi>Drunkenness;</hi> during which he lay in an undecent Posture, having his <hi>Body</hi> uncovered, in his <hi>Tent,</hi> and so exposed to the <hi>Eyes</hi> of his <hi>Children. Ham,</hi> the Father of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was the first of them who spied his <hi>Father</hi> in that condition, and instead of doing that which the discretion of a wise and dutiful <hi>Son</hi> should have obliged him to do, he exposed the <hi>Shame</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> and made it the Subiect of his <hi>Derision</hi> and <hi>Railery:</hi> Nay, he was not contented thus to <hi>Laugh</hi> by himself at his <hi>Father,</hi> but to expose him the more, he would also have both his <hi>Brothers</hi> for <hi>Companions</hi> of his prophane and unnatural <hi>Mirth,</hi> and for <hi>Complices</hi> of his <hi>Crime:</hi> So he went out presently, to tell them what he had seen.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> abominating his ill Nature and Prophaness, and withal being ashamed ad much concerned to see their <hi>Father</hi> thus lying in that immodest Posture, they took a <hi>Garment,</hi> and laid it upon both their <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and so went backward and covered his <hi>Nakedness,</hi> which their <hi>pious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty</hi> did not allow them to look upon.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Noah</hi>'s Fit of <hi>Drunkenness</hi> was over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he understood what had past, and knew what his <hi>Son</hi> had done; not only condemned his <hi>Action,</hi> but presently cursed his Son <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and foretold, That he should for ever be the <hi>Servant of Servants</hi> unto his <hi>Brethren.</hi> And he said, <hi>Blessed be the LORD GOD of</hi> Shem, <hi>and</hi> Cannan <hi>shall be his Servant: GOD shall enlarge</hi> Japhet, <hi>and he shall dwell in the Tents of</hi> Shem, <hi>and</hi> Canaan <hi>shall be his Servant:</hi> And promised them an happy and numerous <hi>Posterity,</hi> to continue in all Ages of the <hi>World.</hi>

                     <p>This <hi>extravagant Design</hi> of theirs was the effect of two Causes, equally vain; the one to eternize their <hi>Memory</hi> by this <hi>Superb</hi> and <hi>stately Structure;</hi> the other was, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themselves against <hi>GOD</hi> himself, if he should ever again attempt to punish the <hi>World</hi> by a <hi>Deluge,</hi> which would not be able to hurt them, when once they should have finished their intended <hi>Building.</hi> But <hi>GOD</hi> willing even then to make it appear, that there is no way for Man to raise himself, but by <hi>Humility,</hi> and that he must rather think of appeasing the Wrath of <hi>GOD</hi> by <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> than of defending himself against his <hi>Just Vengeance,</hi> by vain and successless At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: <hi>Came down</hi> (saith the Scripture) <hi>to see the</hi> City <hi>and the</hi> Tower, <hi>which the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men built;</hi> and mocking at their ridiculous Undertaking, said, <hi>The People is one, and they have all one Language, and this they begin to do; and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do. Go to</hi> (saith the LORD) <hi>let us go down, and there confound their</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>that they may not understand one anothers Speech. So the</hi> LORD <hi>scattered them abroad from thence upon the Face of the Earth, and they left off to build the City; therefore the Name is called</hi> Babel; for the LORD so confounded their <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> that it was impossible for them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what they spake to one another.</p>
                     <p>Thus were they forced to leave the <hi>Work</hi> of their Vanity unfinished, and to disperse themselves over the Face of all the <hi>Earth;</hi> and that was the occasion of calling that <hi>Tower,</hi> the <hi>Tower of Babel,</hi> that is to say, <hi>of Confusion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this <hi>Proud Building</hi> has ever since (according to St. <hi>Bernard</hi>) been a <hi>Figure</hi> of what the <hi>World</hi> would do in all Ages after, who seem to think of nothing, but how to raise to themselves a <hi>Tower</hi> against <hi>GOD,</hi> to secure themselves from his <hi>Justice</hi> and to oppose themselves against his <hi>Majesty,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring rather to immortalize their Names upon <hi>Earth,</hi> than to become truly Great in <hi>Heaven. GOD</hi> was willing then to punish the <hi>Vanity</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> in that <hi>Member,</hi> where it reigns most, that is, in the <hi>Tongue,</hi> which <hi>Man</hi> makes use of to express his <hi>Vanity,</hi> and to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer over others.</p>
                     <p>And this diversity of <hi>Languages,</hi> which has since overspread the <hi>World,</hi> and continues to this day, is as a continual <hi>Voice,</hi> ecchoing throughout the whole <hi>Earth,</hi> and teaching all <hi>People</hi> (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith) <hi>That the shortest and surest way to mount</hi> Heaven, <hi>is not to raise great</hi> Edifices, <hi>nor to hatch vast</hi> Designs <hi>in a</hi> proud Heart; <hi>but by humbling ones self before GOD, and preventing his Wrath with</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting Tears, <hi>and not by pretending to elude it by a vain and fruitless</hi> Resistance.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>Holy Man</hi> was the Son of <hi>Terah,</hi> and dwelt with his Father in the City of <hi>Ur,</hi> in the Land of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> which was an <hi>Idolatrous Country.</hi> It was there that GOD commanded him, saying, <hi>Get thee out of thy Country, and from thy Kindred, and from thy Fathers House, unto a Land that I will shew thee: And I will make thee the Head and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a great People; and make thy Name great and famous; and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all Families of the Earth be blessed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abram,</hi> without any <hi>Hesitation,</hi> believed the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which promised him two such great Advantages; the first, to make him the <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>Great People;</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to bless all the <hi>VVorld</hi> in him who was to proceed from his Loins. So he left his own Country, with <hi>Terah</hi> his Father, and came to <hi>Haran</hi> (a City in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi>) where <hi>Terah</hi> died; after whose Death, he departed from <hi>Haran</hi> with <hi>Sarai</hi> his Wife, and <hi>Lot</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <hi>Son,</hi> and came into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where <hi>GOD</hi> again promised to give him all that <hi>Land;</hi> and <hi>Abram</hi> adoring that <hi>GOD,</hi> who with such Sovereign Power disposeth of <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> giving or taking them away at his pleasure, built an <hi>Altar</hi> to the LORD, there to call upon his Name.</p>
                     <p>After some time of his stay here, there hapned a great <hi>Famine</hi> in the <hi>Land,</hi> which forced him to go down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> with <hi>Sarai</hi> and the rest of his Houshold. But fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing that the <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Sarai</hi> his Wife might be prejudicial to him, and that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> being enamour'd of her, might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </p>
                     <p>What <hi>Abram</hi> had foreseen, so came to pass: For the <hi>Egyptians</hi> admiring <hi>Sarai,</hi> spoke of her before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who took her into his <hi>Palace,</hi> and treated <hi>Abram</hi> very kindly for her sake, as supposing him her <hi>Brother:</hi> But <hi>GOD</hi> knew how to deliver the Chastity of <hi>Sarai</hi> from the Hands of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh;</hi> and he afflicted that Prince with so many <hi>Plagues,</hi> that enquiring into the Cause of them, he came at length to know, that <hi>Sarai</hi> was indeed the Wife of <hi>Abram;</hi> whereupon he restored her to him again, complaining only, that he had not told him so at first.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So much</hi> (saith St. <hi>Ambrose) did that Prince (though an</hi> Idolater) <hi>abhor</hi> Adultery, <hi>and fear to injure a</hi> Stranger, <hi>whom the</hi> Famine <hi>had forced to retire into his Dominions. Thus it was that</hi> GOD <hi>began to call to himself, him, whom he had chosen to be the</hi> Father of the Faithful. <hi>He dealt with him according to the firmness of</hi> Faith, <hi>making him to leave his own Country, where he was rich and powerful, to go and settle himself in a Land, where at first he meets with a grievous</hi> Famine, <hi>which forced him to run a thousand Hazards amongst</hi> strange Nations, <hi>without finding any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but that of knowing, that he was come thither by the Order of him, to whom his</hi> Faith <hi>had yielded such an unreserved Obedience.</hi>

                        <hi>However,</hi> GOD <hi>(by delivering him from all Dangers) gave him full Evidence, that we need not fear any thing in following of GOD, and that whenever we expose our selves to any trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Events, for being faithful to his</hi> Word, <hi>he himself becomes our</hi> Protector, <hi>and with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and advantage delivers us from all the Evils that surround us.</hi>

                        <p>A Strife being risen between the <hi>Herdsmen</hi> of <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> they part one from another, and <hi>Lot</hi> goes to <hi>Sodom.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ABRAM</hi> being returned out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with <hi>Sarai</hi> his Wife, and <hi>Lot</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <hi>Son,</hi> to the Place of their former Abode,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2084. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1920.</note> that is, to <hi>Bethel:</hi> He was soon made sensible of the <hi>Troubles</hi> which were always to attend <hi>Riches.</hi> For being both of them very <hi>wealthy,</hi> there oft arose Quarrels between the Herds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of their <hi>Cattel;</hi> which made it evident (as saith the <hi>Scripture</hi>) that <hi>they could no longer live together,</hi> and that <hi>one Land was not able to bear them both.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abram</hi> abhorring those <hi>Contests,</hi> and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the fatal Consequences, that these <hi>Divisions</hi> between the <hi>Domesticks</hi> of one <hi>Family</hi> were likely to produce, by passing at last from the <hi>Servants</hi> to the <hi>Masters</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, resolved to prevent them by a sudden parting. Wherefore meeting with <hi>Lot,</hi> he said to him, <hi>Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between thy Herdsmen and my Herdsmen, for we be Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> that is to say, very near of Kin: <hi>Is not the whole Land before thee, to choose what part pleaseth thee best? Separate thy self, I pray thee, from me: If thou wilt take the Left Hand, then I will go to the Right; or if thou depart to the Right Hand, then I will go to the Left.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Lot</hi> was not so wise in accepting this Offer, as <hi>Abram</hi> was in making of it: for not sufficiently weighing, how vast a loss he was about to expose himself to, by parting with the Company of such an <hi>Holy Man,</hi> and a Prophet as <hi>Abram</hi> was; and not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ought rather to have done or suffered any thing, than to consent to the Separation, without any considerable Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, gave way to <hi>Abram</hi>'s Proposal, and thereby launched out too imprudently into a <hi>Sea</hi> of a thousand Dangers. He only apply'd himself to consider, which way he had best turn himself, and advising only with his <hi>Eyes</hi> about the Choice he was to make, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it for that Country which pleased and flattered them most: For as the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us, Lot <hi>lifted up his Eyes, and beheld all the Plain of</hi> Jordan, <hi>that it was well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered every where, as the</hi> Garden <hi>of the</hi> LORD. This Allurement readily induces him to fix his Abode in the <hi>Cities</hi> of that fruitful and tempting <hi>Valley,</hi> and to pitch his Tent near <hi>Sodom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus he from the Company of the most <hi>Holy Person,</hi> that was at that time upon the Face of the <hi>Earth,</hi> precipitates himself into the Society of the most abominable <hi>Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> amongst the Sons of <hi>Men;</hi> and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring too unadvisedly from his Uncle, he comes to a City, which <hi>GOD</hi> look'd upon as the Object of his fierce <hi>Anger,</hi> as having by their <hi>Wickedness</hi> out-sinn'd the bounds of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mercy</hi> and <hi>Forbearance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We meet with in this History</hi> (as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> observes) <hi>two important matters. We learn from</hi> Abram<hi>'s Behaviour, the Horrour and Aversion we ought to have for</hi> Differences <hi>and</hi> Disputes, <hi>and how wary we ought to be of</hi> Servants <hi>in this Respect, who often are the first Cause of them, and take pleasure to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And in</hi> Lot <hi>we see, of how great concern it is, especially for younger Persons, not lightly to quit them, in whose Company their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness consists, and who are of greater use to them than they can imagine. A Separation here consented to without sufficient Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, makes the Party concerned sensible of its pernicious Consequences, during the whole Gourse of his</hi> Life: <hi>And though</hi> Lot <hi>was a Righteous</hi> Man (as saith St. <hi>Peter) yet we tremble at the view of those</hi> Dangers, Sorrows, <hi>and</hi> Temptations <hi>into which he plunged himself, and from which the</hi> Charity <hi>of him, whose Company he had too lightly parted with, might have rescued him; and which he might have wholly prevented, by continuing in the Holy Company of his Uncle, that</hi> Man of GOD.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>GOD gives his Blessing to a War, which <hi>Charity</hi> had made this <hi>Holy Patriarch</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, trusting much more in the <hi>Divine Aid,</hi> than in the strength of his Forces. With this small number he stops the Course of the Victories of those four <hi>Kings,</hi> and succeeds in that wherein the united Force of five <hi>Kings</hi> had fail'd: for falling upon them by Night, he makes a great Slaughter amongst them, and pursuing them to <hi>Hoba,</hi> which is on the Left-hand of <hi>Damascus,</hi> he brought back all the Spoil they had taken, and in particular his Nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Sodom</hi> having Advice of this glorious Action, goes out to meet <hi>Abram,</hi> and congratulates his illustrious Success.

                     <p>And that nothing might be wanting to <hi>Abram</hi>'s Glory, the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> would needs force him to take all the <hi>Spoil</hi> he had recovered, as of right belonging to him: which <hi>Abram</hi> generously refused, swearing, that he would not so much as take one Thread of the Spoil, lest he should give him occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to say, he had enriched <hi>Abram.</hi>

                     <p>Some time after, <hi>Sarai</hi> being troubled to see <hi>Abram</hi> without <hi>Children,</hi> wished him to make use of <hi>Hagar</hi> his Bondmaid,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2093. <hi>before Christ,</hi> 1911.</note> as his <hi>Wife,</hi> that the fertility of her <hi>Servant</hi> might sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect of her Barrenness. <hi>Abram</hi> perceiving (as the <hi>Fathers</hi> observe) that <hi>Sarai</hi> was moved to make this Proposal, by a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine instinct,</hi> agreed to her Desires: But she soon found, that what she had intended for her <hi>comfort,</hi> became her most sensible <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, trouble,</hi> and <hi>vexation;</hi> For <hi>Hagar</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her self in her <hi>Masters</hi> Bosom, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd with Joy, that she had <hi>Conceiv'd</hi> by him, was (upon the sudden change of her Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) not longer able to contain her self within the bounds of <hi>Prudence</hi> and her <hi>Duty,</hi> but began to despise her <hi>Mistress,</hi> and forget the respect she owed to her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sarai</hi> immediately makes her Complaints to <hi>Abram;</hi> who to testifie, as he had not already, so would not for the future contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any thing to the Insolence of <hi>Hagar,</hi> and that it was only to please her that he had taken her into his <hi>Bed,</hi> left her wholly to her dispose, to deal with her as she pleased.

                     <p>But as she was in the <hi>Desart,</hi> near a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>LORD</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto her, and asked her, Whence she came, and whither she would go?

                     <p>The <hi>Angels</hi> at first refused to accept his Offer, saying, they would <hi>abide in the street all night:</hi> But true <hi>Charity,</hi> which enflames it self by opposition and resistance, made <hi>Lot</hi> so earnestly to press his <hi>Guests,</hi> that giving way to his Entreaties, they entred his <hi>House;</hi> where he entertain'd them with all possible Marks of his Affection, making them a great <hi>Feast.</hi> But when they were ready to take their <hi>Rest,</hi> the <hi>Men</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> pusht on by that detestable Passion, which was so common amongst them, compassed the <hi>House</hi> round; demanding of him, where the <hi>Men</hi> were that came to him that Night, and pressing him to bring them forth, that they might satisfie their abominable Lust with them.</p>

                     <p>When the <hi>Morning</hi> was come, the <hi>Angels</hi> hastned <hi>Lot</hi> to depart the <hi>City</hi> with his <hi>Wife</hi> and two <hi>Daughters,</hi> that he might not be consumed in the Iniquity of the <hi>City;</hi> and while he lingred, they laid hold on his Hand (<hi>the LORD being merciful to him,</hi>) and brought him out of the <hi>City,</hi> with his <hi>VVife</hi> and two <hi>Daughters,</hi> ordering him to escape for his Life, and not to look behind him, lest he should be consumed. But <hi>Lot</hi> having desir'd leave of them to retire to <hi>Zoar,</hi> they granted his Request, on condition that he should haste thither, for that they could not do any thing till he was arrived in that <hi>City,</hi> which they would save at his Request.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lot</hi> was no sooner entred into <hi>Zoar,</hi> but the LORD rained <hi>Brimstone</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> from the LORD out of <hi>Heaven: And he overthrew those</hi> Cities, <hi>and all the</hi> Plain, <hi>and all the</hi> Inhabitants, <hi>and that which grew upon the Ground. Lot</hi>'s Wife frighted at the sudden Noise she heard, and forgetting the <hi>Angels</hi> Command, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately received an Exemplary Punishment, for looking back she became a <hi>Pillar</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> to serve as a Remedy for time to come, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against the <hi>Corruption</hi> of weak Souls, who after they have entred upon the <hi>strait VVay,</hi> make a halt to <hi>look back</hi> to the things they have abandon'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lot</hi> affrighted at what had hapned to the four <hi>Cities,</hi> and fearing lest the same might befal <hi>Zoar,</hi> where he then was, went up from thence and dwelt in the <hi>Mountain,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the first Advice the <hi>Angels</hi> had given him, and there dwelt in a <hi>Cave</hi> with his two <hi>Daughters;</hi> who imagining, that they and their <hi>Father</hi> were the only remains of all the Inhabitants of the <hi>Earth,</hi> thought it their Duty, not to suffer the whole Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Men</hi> to perish; wherefore having made their <hi>Father</hi> drink <hi>Wine,</hi> they did not stick to commit <hi>Incest,</hi> in hopes of being <hi>Mothers.</hi> And tho' we cannot think on that Action of them without horrour, yet the <hi>Innocence</hi> of their Intention did much lessen the guilt of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus was <hi>Lot</hi> miraculously delivered out of the midst of detestible Sinners, at the Prayer of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and <hi>GOD</hi> punished their horrible <hi>Lusts</hi> by a proportionable <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi> shewing by the <hi>Fire,</hi> the <hi>burning Lust</hi> of the <hi>Sodomites;</hi> and by <hi>Brimstone,</hi> the <hi>abominable Stench</hi> of their <hi>Filthiness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This unhappy People</hi> (according to S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory) were a lively</hi> Figure <hi>of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the</hi> Damned, <hi>and of those</hi> Eternal Burnings <hi>which the</hi> World <hi>mocks at, as</hi> Lot<hi>'s</hi> Sons-in-Law <hi>made a Jest of the</hi> Vengeance <hi>he threatned them with. The</hi> Fear <hi>which seized</hi> Lot, <hi>in seeing so strange an effect of the</hi> Divine Anger, <hi>ought also to lay hold on us, since</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>assures us, That the Men of</hi> Sodom (<hi>how abominable soever they have been) shall be treated with less Rigor in the</hi> Day of Judgment, <hi>than those who having heard his</hi> Holy Word, <hi>have neglected it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But it seems, as if Men were become wholly insensible: For as that terrible Vengeance</hi> (as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith) <hi>doth not prevent the flying about of the</hi> Ashes <hi>of those Abominable</hi> Cities <hi>in most parts of the</hi> World: <hi>So neither doth the Comparison</hi> Christ <hi>made between these</hi> Cities, <hi>and they that despised his</hi> Word, <hi>open their</hi> Eyes, <hi>to prevent the</hi> Fire <hi>of</hi> Hell <hi>by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> Repentance.</p>

                        <hi>Abimelech</hi> terrified by the Threats of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the Idea of the <hi>Crime</hi> he was upon the point of committing, rose early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and called all his Officers and Servants, and told them what <hi>GOD</hi> had acquainted him with; he sent also for <hi>Abraham,</hi> and reproves him sharply for having concealed the <hi>Truth,</hi> asking him wherein he had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, to make him and his Kingdom guilty of so great a <hi>Sin?</hi> and continuing these his Complaints, <hi>Abraham</hi> tells him, that upon his coming to his <hi>City,</hi> he not knowing but that the Inhabitants were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether void of the <hi>Fear of GOD,</hi> and so might think of killing him for his <hi>Wives</hi> sake: This was the only Reason had induced him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to desire <hi>Sarah</hi> to say, she was his <hi>Sister,</hi> as indeed she was, as having hoth had the same <hi>Father,</hi> tho' not the same <hi>Mother;</hi> and that in that he had done no more, than what he had usually done in all other places, where he sojourned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abimelech</hi> being satisfied with this Answer of <hi>Abraham,</hi> restored to him <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, besides the great Presents he made him in <hi>Silver, Herds,</hi> and <hi>Servants;</hi> and taking his leave of <hi>Sarah,</hi> told her, That he had given her <hi>Brother</hi> (as she called him) a thousand Pieces of <hi>Silver,</hi> to buy a <hi>Veil</hi> to cover her (as became a married Wife) that for the time to come, none might be so deceived in her as he had been, but all might know her to be what indeed she was, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Wife. He desired her also to remember the <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> she had like to have made him fall into, that so for the future she might take care, not to occasion the same to others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> (before his Departure) prayed to <hi>GOD</hi> for <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and <hi>GOD</hi> healed him, and his <hi>Wife,</hi> and his <hi>Maid-Servants</hi> of the <hi>Plague</hi> he had laid upon them, because of <hi>Sarah.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sarah</hi> seeing <hi>Ishmael</hi> (the Son of <hi>Hagar</hi>) mocking <hi>Isaac,</hi> desires <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to cast out the <hi>Bond-woman</hi> and her <hi>Son,</hi> that <hi>Isaac</hi> alone might be their <hi>Heir,</hi> according to the <hi>Promise</hi> of GOD.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>GOD fulfilling his Promise to <hi>Sarah,</hi> she brought forth a <hi>Son</hi> in her old Age, at the set time of which GOD had spoken:<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2108. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1896.</note> 
                        <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> gave him the Name of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised</hi> him the eighth day, as the LORD had commanded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sarah</hi> in suckling him her self, though she was look'd upon as a great <hi>Princess,</hi> gave the Lesson to all <hi>Mothers</hi> (as saith St. <hi>Ambrose) That they ought to esteem it their Glory and Joy to give</hi> suck <hi>to their Children; and that they are but</hi> Mothers <hi>by halves, who neglect this Duty which</hi> GOD <hi>and</hi> Nature <hi>have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon them; and which doth greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force and encrease the reciprocal Love between the Mothers and their Children, during the whole course of their Lives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the time of weaning <hi>Isaac</hi> was come, <hi>Abraham</hi> made a great <hi>Feast,</hi> to express his Joy;<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2113. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1891.</note> which was a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> of the great Joy the true <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> receive, when they see their <hi>Children</hi> advance in <hi>Godliness,</hi> being able to digest <hi>strong Meat;</hi> and stand in need no longer of being fed with <hi>Milk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time, whilst <hi>Sarah</hi> had so great cause to <hi>rejoice,</hi> and that her young <hi>Son</hi> did now abundantly recompence the Grief and Reproach of her past <hi>Barrenness, Ishmael (Hagar</hi>'s Son) becomes an occasion of as much Trouble to her, as his <hi>Mother</hi> had been some years before. This Lad finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self frustrated in his great Hopes by the Birth of <hi>Isaac,</hi> whom he considered with regret, as the Heir of those vast <hi>Riches</hi> which he had already promised to himself, could not endure to see the Joy his <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> took in him, without conceiving a secret <hi>Envy</hi> against him, which he evidenced by his outward Carriage, behaving himself abusively towards him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sarah</hi> foresaw the fatal Consequences this <hi>Hatred</hi> might entail upon them, and being most tenderly concerned for her <hi>Son,</hi> whom she knew was design'd by GOD to be the Heir of all their Goods, she earnestly entreats <hi>Abraham</hi> to cast out the <hi>Bond-woman</hi> and her <hi>Son.</hi> This Request at the first greatly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Abraham,</hi> as seeming very harsh and grievous to him; but <hi>GOD</hi> having advised him in all things to do as <hi>Sarah</hi> had said, he rose up early in the Morning, and took <hi>Bread,</hi> and a Bottle of <hi>Water,</hi> and gave them to <hi>Hagar</hi> and sent her away with her <hi>Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hagar</hi> thus turn'd out, wanders in the <hi>Wilderness</hi> of <hi>Beersheba;</hi> where her <hi>Water</hi> being spent, she cast her Son underneath one of the <hi>Shrubs,</hi> and sat down over-against him a good way off, that she might not see her Son die. But behold, as she lift up her <hi>Voice</hi> and <hi>wept,</hi> an <hi>Angel</hi> calls to her from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and speaking comfortably to her, commands her to take up her <hi>Son,</hi> for that <hi>GOD heard the Voice of the Lad,</hi> and would make him the <hi>Father</hi> of a great Nation; and opens her Eyes to discern a <hi>Well of Water,</hi> which was near her. <hi>Hagar</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by this <hi>seasonable Refreshment</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Support,</hi> educates her Son in the <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi> where he became a dextrous <hi>Archer; And his Mother took him a VVife out of the the Land of</hi> Egypt.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly tells us, That GOD did then (in <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ishmael</hi>) set forth a lively <hi>Picture</hi> of what was to happen in the <hi>Church</hi> in all Ages, where the <hi>Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> should be persecuted by their own <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> He who will be <hi>Isaac,</hi> must always suffer the Envy and Insultings of <hi>Ishmael;</hi> and be so far from rendring <hi>Evil for Evil,</hi> that he rather bemoans the unhappiness of his <hi>Brother,</hi> who is for ever banished from his <hi>Father's House.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis the <hi>Grace of GOD</hi> alone, and so we must own it, that makes us Sons of the <hi>Free-woman;</hi> and to chuse rather to be persecuted with <hi>Isaac,</hi> than to persecute others with <hi>Ishmael,</hi> because the <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> of <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> is only Temporal, whereas the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of <hi>Isaac</hi> is eternal.</p>

                     <p>Having spent two Days in his Journey, (during which, neither the sight of his <hi>dear Son,</hi> nor the Work he was sent about, having been able to shake his <hi>Faith</hi>) on the third Day lifting up his <hi>Eyes,</hi> he sees afar off the Place appointed for this wonderful <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and having charged his <hi>Servants</hi> to stay at the Foot of the <hi>Mountain,</hi> while he and his Son went to worship GOD, he takes the <hi>Wood</hi> of the <hi>Burnt-Offering,</hi> and lays it on <hi>Isaac</hi> his Son: who going up this <hi>Mountain,</hi> laden with the <hi>Wood</hi> which was to consume him, was a most lively <hi>Figure</hi> of the true <hi>Isaac,</hi> who went up to <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> bearing the <hi>Wood</hi> upon which he was to consummate the <hi>Offering</hi> of all <hi>Offerings,</hi> and the fulfilling of all <hi>Sacrifices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilst <hi>Isaac</hi> thus climbs the <hi>Mountain</hi> with his <hi>Father,</hi> who carried the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Sacrificing</hi>-Knife in his Hands, he asketh him, where the <hi>Lamb</hi> was, that was design'd for the <hi>Burnt-Offering?</hi> But <hi>Abraham,</hi> in a transport of <hi>Faith,</hi> as one who had forgot that he was his <hi>Father,</hi> answers him without any emotion, that <hi>GOD</hi> would provide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a <hi>Lamb.</hi> And being arrived at the place, to which <hi>GOD</hi> had directed him, he built there an Altar, laid the <hi>Wood</hi> in order, and binding <hi>Isaac</hi> his Son, laid him on the <hi>Altar</hi> upon the <hi>Wood,</hi> and stretching forth his Hand, took the <hi>Knife</hi> to slay him.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>GOD</hi> seeing this unparallel'd and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous Constancy in the <hi>Father,</hi> as well as Submission in the <hi>Son,</hi> and not willing that this great <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which in his Eyes (who looks at the Heart) was already as good as accomplish'd, should be sullied with <hi>Blood,</hi> to represent the <hi>unbloody Christian Sacrifices</hi> of <hi>Self-denial</hi> and <hi>Resignation,</hi> stops his Hand by an <hi>Angel</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> as knowing now that he truly feared him, seeing he had not with-held his <hi>Son,</hi> his only and most dearly <hi>beloved Son</hi> from him. Hereupon <hi>Abraham</hi> seeing a <hi>Ram caught in a Thicket by his Horns,</hi> offered him up to <hi>GOD</hi> instead of his <hi>Son,</hi> and returned to his House.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This History (so full of</hi> Mysteries, <hi>and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the particular Circumstances are such live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Figures <hi>of what was afterwards to befal</hi> Jesus Christ) <hi>contains a most excellent</hi> Lesson <hi>for</hi> Parents, <hi>teaching them to have no greater</hi> Passion <hi>for their</hi> Children, <hi>than to offer them up to</hi> GOD.</p>
                     <p>And St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> thinks, <hi>he cannot suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently lament the Misery of those</hi> Christian Parents, <hi>who instead of offering their</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>up to</hi> GOD, <hi>like</hi> Abraham, <hi>sacrifice them to the</hi> Devil, <hi>by engaging them in the Vanity of the</hi> World, <hi>and corrupting their tender and flexible</hi> Disposition <hi>by their</hi> wicked Examples. <hi>An only</hi> Abraham (saith he) <hi>offers his Son</hi> Isaac <hi>to</hi> GOD, <hi>but whole Crowds offer their</hi> Children <hi>to</hi> Devils; <hi>and the Joy we have to see a small number, who take some care to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducate their</hi> Children, <hi>is quite stifled by the</hi> Grief <hi>we receive from those vast numbers that destroy them, and who deserve for their Ambition or Negligence, to be accounted the</hi> Murtherers <hi>rather than</hi> Parents <hi>of their</hi> Children.</p>

                     <p>'Tis a thing we can never sufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, that this <hi>Holy Man,</hi> having so often received repeated Assurances from <hi>God,</hi> That all the <hi>Land</hi> where he then sojourned, should be his one day, yet should never think of making any Purchase there, save only of a <hi>Burying-place</hi> for himself and <hi>Children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It seems his continual eying of <hi>Heaven</hi> made him despise the <hi>Earth,</hi> where he lived only to die daily. And whilst <hi>God</hi> was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give a long <hi>Posterity</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to that <hi>Posterity,</hi> the best and most fruitful of all Lands, <hi>Abraham</hi> thinks of nothing but his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Burial,</hi> and of leaving no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inheritance for his <hi>Children,</hi> but the same he had purchased for himself in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Burying-place,</hi> thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them also to the continual Meditation of <hi>Death,</hi> and consequently to a Contempt of all earthly and outward <hi>Possessions</hi> whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; the enjoyment of which being only momentany, are not worthy enough or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to employ the Thoughts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of an immortal an intelligent <hi>Creature,</hi> design'd for the Enjoyment and Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more lasting, yea eternal and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Objects and Possessions.</p>

The Divine Oracle answered, <hi>That these two Children should be the Heads of two People, and that the eldest of them should serve the younger.</hi> Accordingly when her time was come, she was delivered of <hi>Twins.</hi> He who was first born came out Red and Hairy, and was called <hi>Esau,</hi> and immediately after came out his Brother, whose Hand took hold on <hi>Esau</hi>'s Heel, which gave him the name of <hi>Jacob.</hi>

                     <p>For <hi>Isaac</hi> being sensible of his great Age, and willing to bless his <hi>Children</hi> before his Death, called to him his Eldest Son <hi>Esau,</hi> whom he loved, and bids him <hi>take his Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, his Quiver and his Bow, and go out to hunt some</hi> Venison <hi>for him, and make him Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury Meat, such as he loved, that his Soul might bless him before he died.</hi>

                        <hi>Rebekah</hi> immediately acquaints <hi>Jacob</hi> with what passed, and bid him fetch her two <hi>Kids,</hi> that she might make <hi>Savoury Meat</hi> for <hi>Isaac,</hi> such as he loved; <hi>Jacob</hi> having herein obey'd his Mother, she makes hast to dress them after such a manner as she knew her Husband liked best. In the mean time she takes good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rayment of her eldest Son <hi>Esau,</hi> and puts them upon <hi>Jacob</hi> her younger Son; and she put the Skins of the <hi>Kids</hi> upon his <hi>Hands,</hi> and upon the <hi>Smooth</hi> of his <hi>Neck,</hi> to the end that his <hi>Father</hi> (whose <hi>Sight</hi> failed him) in perceiving the Voice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> might not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding (by the <hi>Hairiness</hi> of his Hands and Neck) suppose him to be <hi>Esau</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jacob</hi> coming to his Father, with the <hi>Meat</hi> his Mother had prepared, and desiring him to eat of his <hi>Venison; Isaac</hi> was suprized to hear a Voice which resembled that of <hi>Jacob,</hi> rather than the Voice of <hi>Esau,</hi> bid him come near to him, that he might feel, whether he were his very Son <hi>Esau</hi> or no; and feeling the Hair of the <hi>Kids-skins,</hi> he said, <hi>the Voice is</hi> Jacobs <hi>Voice, but the Hands are the Hands of</hi> Esau. After he had eaten, as he went to kiss <hi>Jacob,</hi> he smelled the smell of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and blessing him, said; <hi>Behold the smell of my Son, is as the smell of a Field which the Lord hath blessed; therefore</hi> GOD <hi>give thee of the Dew of Heaven, and plenty of Corn and Wine. Let People serve thee, and Nations bow down to thee: Be Lord over thy Brethren, and let thy Mothers Sons bow down to thee.

                     </p>
                     <p>Scarcely had <hi>Isaac</hi> made an end of these Words, but <hi>Esau</hi> comes in from <hi>Hunting,</hi> and having prepared his <hi>Savoury Meat,</hi> brings it in to his Father <hi>Isaac,</hi> and desires him to eat of his <hi>Venison,</hi> that his <hi>Soul</hi> might bless him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Holy Patriarch</hi> perceiving what had hapned was extreamly surprized, insomuch that he trembled exceedingly. But perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Divine Direction</hi> in the whole conduct of that Affair; so far was he from retracting what he had done, that he confirmed and ratified it, declaring that as he had Blessed, so he should be Blessed. <hi>Esau</hi> upon hearing these words from his <hi>Father,</hi> cryed with a great and exceeding bitter Cry, and said, <hi>Bless me, even me also my Father:</hi> And then reflecting and complaining of the Deceit of his <hi>Brother,</hi> he asked his <hi>Father,</hi> whether he had no more than one only <hi>Blessing? Being in this respect</hi> (as the <hi>Fathers</hi> observe) <hi>a figure of those who are desirous to unite</hi> GOD <hi>and the</hi> World <hi>together, cast about how they may enjoy the Comforts of</hi> Heaven, <hi>and the Pleasures of the</hi> Earth <hi>both together.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Isaac</hi> moved with the bitter cries of his Son <hi>Esau,</hi> Blesseth him also, but so as to subject him to his Brother; which made him conceive such an implacable Hatred against <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he desired nothing more than his Fathers Death, that he might kill him.</p>

                     <p>To make this her design the readier to be approved of by <hi>Isaac,</hi> she took an occasion to discourse with him about <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Marriage,</hi> assuring him, that she should never be able to bear it, if <hi>Jacob</hi> should take one of the <hi>Daughters</hi> of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for his <hi>Wife,</hi> following the lewd Example of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Esau,</hi> who had married two of them, not regarding the aversion his <hi>Parents</hi> had against them.

                     </p>
                     <p>As soon as they were met, <hi>Laban</hi> complains to <hi>Jacob,</hi> reproaching him for basely stealing away from him, and hurrying away his <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as <hi>Captives</hi> taken by the Sword: He told him, it was ill done to conceal his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and thereby to prevent him of taking his last farewel of his <hi>Children,</hi> and to shew his Peternal tenderness for them; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that however he might exercise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the Possession he had to return to his own <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>Fathers House;</hi> yet that his robbing him of his <hi>Idols</hi> was a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, and that he could have no Pretence or Plea for it.</p>

                        <hi>Jacob</hi> at these Words interrupted him, and having excused the Privacy of his Departure, absolutely deny'd the taking away the said <hi>Idols,</hi> so far as to give him leave to kill the Party with whom he should find them. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> having fought them with great diligence, at last enters <hi>Rachels Tent;</hi> but before his coming she had carefully hid them in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels Furniture,</hi> and sitting upon them, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her Father, not to take it ill, that she rose not up to pay him her dutiful Respects, as being at that time indispos'd.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>In this</hi> History, Jacob <hi>is to be admired as a perfect Model of that</hi> Wisdom <hi>and</hi> Justice <hi>which we are to observe in living in the World: He took care not to burthen himself with the possession of any thing, but what he could take along with him, to the end he might not be forced to depend upon any one. As he lost nothing of what was his own, neither took he ought that belonged to another.

                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Messengers</hi> (upon their return) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting <hi>Jacob,</hi> that as soon as they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their Message to <hi>Esau,</hi> he had put himself at the Head of 400 Armed Men, and was already on his march to meet him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came seized with an extream <hi>Fear,</hi> which made him cast forth strong Cries to <hi>GOD,</hi> to deliver him from the Hand of <hi>Esau</hi> his Brother.</p>
                     <p>Having thus first of all fixed his confidence in <hi>GOD,</hi> he proceeded to make use of all his <hi>Natural Prudence</hi> to calm his <hi>Brothers</hi> Anger, and to incline his Heart towards him, which he thought he could not so well do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other way than by Presents.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jacob</hi> having given these Orders, which were not to be executed until the next <hi>day,</hi> caused his <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> (with all that belonged to him) to pass over the Brook <hi>Jabbok</hi> by Night, whilst <hi>Jacob</hi> was left alone on the other side. Then <hi>Jacob</hi> betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in earnest <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>GOD,</hi> for an happy issue of the <hi>Meeting</hi> between him and his <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> whereupon a <hi>Man,</hi> (or rather an <hi>Angel</hi> in the shape of a <hi>Man</hi>) appeared unto him, and <hi>Wrestled</hi> with him until the <hi>Break of Day;</hi> and seeing that he did not prevail against him, he touched the <hi>Sinew</hi> or <hi>Hollow</hi> of his <hi>Thigh,</hi> and caused him to halt: But <hi>Jacob</hi> taking new Courage from this happy hurt, told him he had hurt him; and the <hi>Angel</hi> would fain have been gone, but <hi>Jacob</hi> would not let him go until he had blessed him. Then the <hi>Angel</hi> demanded what was his Name, and gave him the new Name of <hi>ISRAEL;</hi> withal assuring him, that as he had been so happy and strong as to prevail with <hi>GOD,</hi> he had no need to apprehend any thing of danger from <hi>Men,</hi> and in particular from his Brother <hi>Esau.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not long after <hi>Jacob</hi> seeing his Brother coming a far off, at the Head of 400 <hi>Men,</hi> and having ranged his <hi>Family</hi> in the order he thought best, he passed on before them to meet him; and as he came near he bowed himself seven times to the ground before him, and not being able to resist the powerful impression which <hi>Jacob</hi>'s meek Submission made upon his Spirit, runs to meet him, falls upon his Neck, and kisses him; yea, his former <hi>Wrath</hi> was turn'd to that degree of <hi>Tenderness</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> that he could not withhold himself from <hi>Tears.</hi> He with pleasure beholds the <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> had given him, and could hardly be perswaded to receive the <hi>Presents</hi> that <hi>Jacob</hi> design'd for him.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Esau</hi> (to shew his Kindness to him) offered to keep Company with him, and with his <hi>Armed Men,</hi> to be a <hi>Guard</hi> to him and his <hi>Company,</hi> but <hi>Jacob</hi> having repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him how necessary it was for him to go on softly, because of the tenderness of his young <hi>Children</hi> and the <hi>Herds</hi> with young, which if over-driven but one day, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly die, pressed <hi>Esau</hi> to march on before to <hi>Mount Sier,</hi> where he would not fail to wait upon him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus did he not only avoid the Anger of his Brother, who had sworn his destruction; but moreover changed it into Tenderness and Love. He did not fix his Thoughts upon the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his own Innocence, or</hi> Esaus <hi>Guilt and Blame-worthiness; he blotted out of his Heart all the Resentments he might have had against him; and if he was troubled for his Misdemeanors, 'twas rather</hi> (saith S. <hi>Ambrose) for his Brothers sake than his own.</hi>

                        <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Shechem</hi> having made this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal to their <hi>Subjects,</hi> they presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and were <hi>Circumcised:</hi> But on the third day, when their <hi>Pain</hi> was most sensible, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi (Dinahs</hi> Brothers) took their <hi>Swords,</hi> and came boldly upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and slew all the <hi>Males,</hi> without sparing the <hi>King</hi> himself, or his <hi>Son,</hi> whose unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Lusts</hi> were the first cause of this Bloodshed.

                        <hi>Jacob</hi> was extreamly troubled at this their unheard of Revenge, complaining that they had made his <hi>Name</hi> hateful and abominable amongst the Inhabitants of the Land, by this their horrible <hi>Profidiousness,</hi> and that by their Abuse of the Divine Ordinance of <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to satisfie their Revenge, they had as far as in them lay exposed him, and his whole <hi>Family</hi> to apparent Ruine, for that he was but few in number, and not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them.</p>
                     <p>Whilst <hi>Jacob</hi> was in no small apprehension of the Mischief, which the Violence of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> might bring upon him from the Neighbouring <hi>People,</hi> who had heard the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their Inhuman <hi>Cruelty, GOD</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to go to <hi>Bethel,</hi> the place where he had appeared to him when he fled from his Brother <hi>Esau:</hi> And the <hi>Scripture</hi> takes notice, that <hi>GOD</hi> cast his Terror upon all the <hi>Cities</hi> round about them, that tho' their will was good, they had not the Courage to pursue after the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>This <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Dinah</hi> has always been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as a pregnant Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, teaching us <hi>to avoid vain Curiosity, and the Affection of the Company of Strangers</hi>

                           <hi>Joseph</hi> is sold by his <hi>Brethren</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>JACOB,</hi> who had lately escaped a War with <hi>Strangers,</hi> was fain soon after to meet with one in his own <hi>House,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2276. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1728. 12 <hi>years before the Death of</hi> Isaac.</note> which was the more grievous unto him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between those of his own <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joseph</hi> (the Son of <hi>Rachel</hi>) being the last of the Children that were born to <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> at the Age of 16 years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, accused his <hi>Brethren</hi> to his <hi>Father</hi> of some enormous Crime, which the Scripture doth not mention. This bold Undertaking of their younger <hi>Brother,</hi> and the tender Love his <hi>Father</hi> had for him, produced so great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy against him, that they could not so much as speak one Friendly Word to him. This their <hi>Hatred</hi> was much increased by his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with two of his <hi>Dreams;</hi> the one, that as he and his <hi>Brethren</hi> were binding their <hi>Sheaves,</hi> his <hi>Sheaf</hi> arose and stood up in the midst of theirs, and they worshipped it: And the other, that he saw the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Eleven Stars</hi> worshipping him. These two <hi>Dreams,</hi> which plainly presaged his future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation, excited a most furious <hi>Hatred</hi> against him, which <hi>GOD</hi> made use of for his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</p>
                     <p>Some time after, when <hi>Jacob</hi> had sent <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> to visit his <hi>Brethren,</hi> (who fed their <hi>Flocks</hi> in <hi>Shechem</hi>) they seeing him coming afar off, conspired against him to slay him. But <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi> his eldest <hi>Brother,</hi> abhor'd this their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable Design, and hiding his resolution of saving him, counselled them not to dip their Hands in the <hi>Blood</hi> of their <hi>Brother;</hi> but to satisfie themselves by casting him into a <hi>Pit,</hi> hoping thereby to take him out, and deliver him to his <hi>Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His <hi>Brethren</hi> approved of <hi>Reuben</hi>'s Advice, and having stript him of his <hi>Party-coloured Coat, let him down into the</hi> Pit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>and they sat them down to eat Bread; and they lift up their Eyes, and behold a Company of</hi> Ishmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites <hi>that came from</hi> Gilead <hi>with their</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, <hi>going into</hi> Egypt. <hi>And</hi> Judah <hi>said, what profit is it if we slay our Brother? Let us sell him, and let not our Hand be upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he is our Brother; and they were content. And they took</hi> Joseph <hi>out of the Pit, and sold him to the</hi> Ishmaelites <hi>for</hi> 20 <hi>Pieces of</hi> Silver, <hi>and they brought him into</hi> Egypt. <hi>And they took</hi> Joseph's Coat, <hi>and killed a</hi> Kid, <hi>and dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the</hi> Coat <hi>in the</hi> Blood, <hi>and sent it to their</hi> Father. <hi>And</hi> Jacob <hi>at the first sight knew it to be</hi> Joseph<hi>'s, and concluded that</hi> a wild Beast <hi>had devoured him; and being seized with a violent Sorrow, he rent his</hi> Garments, <hi>put on</hi> Sackcloth, <hi>and mourned many Days. And his</hi> Sons <hi>and</hi> Daughters <hi>rose up to comfort him; but he refused.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus Little <hi>Joseph,</hi> who in his <hi>Dreams</hi> had had a foresight of his future Greatness, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation, yet did not foresee his being sold for a <hi>Slave:</hi> And <hi>GOD,</hi> who revealed to him the <hi>Dignity</hi> he was to arrive at, conceal'd the <hi>Afflictions</hi> that were to make way for them. He was fain to give way (for a time) to the Envy of his <hi>Brethren,</hi> that in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular (as in many others) he might be a lively Image of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and the comfort of good Men, who in all Ages to come should be exposed to the Envy of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> and the Conspirings of their own <hi>Brethren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Grief of</hi> Jacob <hi>(which was so just) may nevertheless serve for an Instruction to all</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; <hi>for though he sorely lamented his Death, yet probably that which was the chiefest Cause, was his loving him too well, which occasioned his loss, thereby stiring up the Envy of his</hi> Brethren <hi>against him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is good to love ones</hi> Children; <hi>yea, it is but a piece of Justice, to love those better than others, who are most vertuous: But it is of dangerous consequence to give too open Marks of it, because this may be pernicious to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, by exasperating their Envy to see him preferr'd before them; and</hi> Fathers <hi>ought in this case to consider, that they can scarce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a greater advantage to their Darlings, than to make them to beloved of all their</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And we need not wonder, if we see that a piece of</hi> Land, <hi>or a particular</hi> Legacy <hi>given to a best-beloved</hi> Son, <hi>doth incite the Envy of all his</hi> Brethren; <hi>because we see here, that a</hi> Coat <hi>only which</hi> Jacob <hi>gave</hi> Joseph, <hi>was the occasion of this their great</hi> aversion <hi>and</hi> hatred <hi>unto him.</hi>

                        <hi>JOSEPH</hi> being cast into <hi>Prison,</hi> made it appear (by the favour he found there) that places which are inaccessible to <hi>Men,</hi> are not so to the <hi>Divine Mercy</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> and that the more we expose our selves by our <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to him, the more he loads us with the Marks of his Favour. <hi>Joseph</hi> in all his Carriage gave such pregnant Evidence of his <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> that the <hi>Keeper</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the <hi>Prisoners</hi> to his Care, giving him full Authority over them.</p>
                     <p>Whilst these things passed, two <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the one his chief <hi>Butler,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Baker,</hi> having offended their <hi>LORD,</hi> and being put into the same <hi>Prison</hi> with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> they hapned to <hi>dream</hi> two very signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and presaging <hi>Dreams;</hi> The <hi>Butler, that a Vine was before him, and on the Vine three Branches, which budded, blossomed, and brought forth ripe Grapes, which he took and pressed into</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Cup, and presented it to him.</hi> The <hi>Baker, that he had three Baskets on his head, and that in the uppermost Basket were all manner of Bake-meats for</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>which the Birds came and eat out of the Basket that was on his head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joseph</hi> at that time being a Figure of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> by the difference he made between those his two <hi>Companions</hi> in his Sufferings, assures the <hi>Baker,</hi> that within three Days he should have his <hi>Head</hi> cut off, and his <hi>Body</hi> hanged upon a <hi>Tree;</hi> and the <hi>Butler,</hi> that within three Days <hi>Pharaoh</hi> should restore him to his Place, and pray'd him to remember him in his Prosperity.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Pharaoh</hi> being much concern'd to know the Interpretation of his <hi>Dreams,</hi> the <hi>Butler</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents himself before the <hi>King,</hi> and tells him of <hi>Joseph,</hi> who immediately sent for him. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> having heard the <hi>King</hi> tell his <hi>Dreams,</hi> acquaints him, that they signified 7 years to come of great plenty, which were to be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by 7 other years of the extreamest <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;</hi> and to prevent the fatal effects thereof, he counselled the <hi>King</hi> to appoint great <hi>Store-houses</hi> throughout all the <hi>Land,</hi> to lay up all the Surplus of the <hi>Plentiful years,</hi> to serve for a supply during the 7 years of <hi>Famine.</hi>

                        <hi>Pharaoh</hi> admiring the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of <hi>Joseph,</hi> presently concluded with himself, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy could be more fit to manage this Affair than himself; and accordingly conferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him full power over all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to order things as he should think fit, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this new Dignity to him, by taking a <hi>Ring</hi> from his own <hi>Hand,</hi> and putting it upon <hi>Josephs,</hi> and a <hi>Gold-Chain</hi> about his <hi>Neck,</hi> and making him ride in his second <hi>Chariot,</hi> the <hi>Heralds</hi> proclaiming before him, <hi>Bend the Knee.</hi>

He received with an equal and indifferent temper from the hands of</hi> GOD <hi>the Good and Evil things of this World; and continually kept his Heart in that uniform Moderation, that in the midst of his great power, he never had a thought of revenging himself of those, who by their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies had so unjustly afflicted him, and whom he thought but too severely punished by the Sole remembrance of their</hi> Crimes, <hi>and the despair and gnawing Checks of their own</hi> Conscience.</p>

                        <hi>These</hi> Changes <hi>visibly hapned here on</hi> Earth; <hi>but there are others that happen still every day invisibly by a Miracle incomparably greater, of which the Elevation of</hi> Joseph <hi>was only a</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, <hi>when those who have (as it were) been trod under foot by</hi> Men, <hi>and made vile by</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>and</hi> Calumnies, <hi>do in an instant pass over from all their</hi> Sufferings, <hi>which have lasted but for a Moment, to that Eternity of</hi> Glory, <hi>which their</hi> Sufferings <hi>have prepared for them.</hi>

                     <p>The Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as well as other Neighbouring <hi>Countries,</hi> was made sensible of this extraordinary <hi>Famine:</hi> Wherefore <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> having heard that there was <hi>Corn</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> bids his <hi>Sons</hi> go down thither, and buy <hi>Corn</hi> for his <hi>Family.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ten Sons, being all, except <hi>Benjamin,</hi> whom his <hi>Father</hi> would not part with for fear any <hi>Mischief</hi> might befal him by the way, came (amongst many others) to buy <hi>Corn</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and presented themselves before <hi>Joseph,</hi> and bowed down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with their Faces to the Ground.</p>

                        <hi>Joseph</hi> knew his Brothers at first sight, but carried himself strange towards them, and not seeing <hi>Benjamin</hi> with them, fearing lest they might have treated him as cruelly as they had formerly done him; and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved hereof, he <hi>spake roughly to them,</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them they were <hi>Spies,</hi> and come to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>weakness</hi> of the <hi>Land.</hi>

                     <p>Thus they departed with the <hi>Presents</hi> their <hi>Father</hi> had ordered them to take along with them; for <hi>Joseph</hi> the Governour of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who having seen his Brothers, and <hi>Benjamin</hi> with them, ordered them to be brought into his House to <hi>Dine</hi> with him.

                     <p>The <hi>Steward</hi> very friendly assured them, that he had had their <hi>Mony,</hi> and having brought <hi>Simeon</hi> out to them, soon after <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> himself entred where his <hi>Brethren</hi> were; who bowing down before him, presented to him the <hi>Gifts</hi> their Father had sent him, which he very kindly accepted of; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing familiarly with them, asked how it was with their <hi>Father</hi>?

                           <hi>Jacob,</hi> with his whole Family, goes down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Joseph</hi> his Son.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AS soon as <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and had brought the glad Tidings to <hi>Jacob,</hi> that <hi>Joseph</hi> was yet alive, and Governour over the whole Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> that <hi>Holy Patriarch,</hi> struck with the strangeness of such unexpected News, was (between the agitations of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> strugling in his Breast) cast into a kind of Fainting; from whence, as soon as he was recovered, he informed himself more particularly concerning all the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of the Divine Providence towards his Son <hi>Joseph:</hi> And being fully satisfied therein, not only by the Relation of those who had seen him; but also by the <hi>Chariots</hi> which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had sent, and the Provision <hi>Joseph</hi> had made for their commodious Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation into <hi>Egypt,</hi> his <hi>Spirit</hi> revived, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting himself, that he was going to see his most beloved Son <hi>Joseph,</hi> whom so many years he had so disconsolately mourned for as dead.</p>
                     <p>But yet notwithstanding his earnest desire to see his dearest <hi>Joseph,</hi> he could not on a sudden resolve to transport himself and his Family into <hi>Egypt,</hi> by reason of the Promises GOD had made to him, of bestowing upon him and his Posterity, the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> for he feared, lest his <hi>Children</hi> being charm'd with the <hi>Pleasures</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> should never entertain a Thought of returning to the Land, that GOD had bestowed upon them for ever. But GOD de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd him of this Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The same Year,</hi> 2198. <hi>before Christ,</hi> 1706. <hi>At the beginning of the</hi> 3d <hi>year of Famin.</hi>
                        </note> by appearing to him in a <hi>Vision</hi> by Night, and assuring him, that as he would go down with him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> so he would in due time, bring his <hi>Posterity</hi> up from thence again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joseph</hi> being informed by <hi>Judah</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of his Father <hi>Jacob</hi>'s coming, he made ready his <hi>Chariot,</hi> and went to meet him to <hi>Goshen;</hi> and being come near<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he stept down, and presenting himself before his <hi>Father,</hi> embraced him, and fell on his Neck and wept, not being able for some time to move, by reason of the great Transport of Joy.</p>
                     <p>After this their Passion of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Tears,</hi> which so unlook'd for an Interview had forc'd from them, <hi>Joseph</hi> brings his Father to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> to salute him; and it being his desire, that his Fathers <hi>Family</hi> might live a part from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he was not asham'd in the midst of all his Grandeur, to declare to the <hi>King,</hi> that his Father and Brethren were <hi>Shepherds;</hi> a Calling the <hi>Egyptians</hi> look'd upon as the most detestable that could be. And having obtain'd a Grant of the <hi>King,</hi> for them to dwell in the Land of <hi>Goshen,</hi> they lived there in all Plenty, without being sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the least effects of that raging <hi>Famine.</hi> Thus the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was then compriz'd in 70 Persons, was saved by the Divine Providence, and the Kindness and Industry of <hi>Joseph.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus</hi> (as S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observes) <hi>does GOD dispose all the Affairs and Concerns of his own</hi> People, <hi>through an admirable variety of happy and sad Events. He afflicts them, lest a continued and uninterrupted course of Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity should lift them up; and again, He comforts them, for fear they might be cast down under the burthen of their Sufferings. It proved now</hi> Jacob<hi>'s advantage, that he had lost his</hi> Son <hi>for a time; and</hi> Joseph<hi>'s, that he had been a while separated from his dear</hi> Father<hi>'s Company; because at this meeting they received such an extraordinary Incom of</hi> Joy, <hi>as quite effaced, and abundantly recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all their past</hi> Sorrows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But on the other side, tho' the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>were well received by the</hi> Egyptians <hi>for a season, that Faithless People made them some years after suffer all that Inhumanity could inspire to a Barbarous People, and Haters of GOD. For</hi> Egypt, (as the Fathers tell us) <hi>that is to say, the</hi> World, <hi>ought always to be apprehended and suspected by true</hi> Israelites; <hi>whatsoever Caresses she might seem to make them, they ought not to trust her: For it is evident, that the People of GOD have always been forced (sooner or later) to acknowledge, that their entring into it has been of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som consequence, even then, when they have been forc'd to it by inevitable Necessity; and they find by Experience,</hi> (as saith S. <hi>Bernard) that the</hi> Famine <hi>which forces them thither, is always to be feared.</hi>

                  <head>The CONTENTS of the Second Book of <hi>Moses,</hi> called EXODUS.</head>
                  <p>THis <hi>Book</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> is called <hi>Exodus;</hi> that is, a <hi>Going forth</hi> or <hi>Departure;</hi> a Name retain'd almost by all the <hi>Interpreters</hi> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> as agreeing very well with that which is the principal Subject thereof. For after that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> hath given us an account, at the beginning of this <hi>Book,</hi> of the strange increase and multiplying of the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and how <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had contrived, to suppress and destroy them; he relates the <hi>Birth,</hi> with the miraculous <hi>Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> and <hi>Education</hi> of <hi>Moses;</hi> and how GOD call'd him, and sent him with <hi>Aaron</hi> his <hi>Brother,</hi> to deliver his <hi>People</hi> from the House of <hi>Bondage,</hi> that is, to bring them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pharaoh</hi> being hardned, and continuing so, obstinately refuseth to let the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> go; whereupon <hi>GOD</hi> visits the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> with ten sore <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Judgments,</hi> and afterwards (with a stretched-out Arm) he brought them forth, by the Hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> from thence, laden with <hi>Riches,</hi> after that they had celebrated the Feast of the <hi>Passover,</hi> in memory of the <hi>Destroying Angels</hi> passing by the <hi>Houses</hi> of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when he slew the <hi>First-born</hi> in all the <hi>Houses</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having this brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he led them through the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> (in which <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> pursuing them, was drowned with all his Host) into the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> through which he conducted them with a <hi>Pillar of Fire</hi> by <hi>Night,</hi> and a <hi>Pillar of Cloud</hi> by <hi>Day;</hi> giving them <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven, and <hi>Quails</hi> to eat, and providing them Drink out of the <hi>Rock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Wilderness</hi> they were set upon by the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> whom they vanquished and destroyed. Here also <hi>Jethro</hi> came to <hi>Moses,</hi> and gave him such wholsom Advice, as proved afterwards of great use to him. In the same <hi>Desert, GOD</hi> also gave to the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> (by <hi>Moses</hi>) upon <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> (in order to a more solemn Renewal of his <hi>Covenant</hi> with them) the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> writ with his own <hi>Finger</hi> in two <hi>Tables of Stone;</hi> as also several other <hi>Laws, Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Statutes,</hi> as well Sacred and Ceremonial, as Civil and Politick, to consecrate them in a peculiar manner to himself, and separate them from all other <hi>People,</hi> and above all in giving them the <hi>Figures, Signs, Pledges</hi> and <hi>Seals</hi> of that full Propitiation, which was in due time to be accomplish'd by the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> who was the Head and Foundation of the <hi>Eternal Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>GOD there also commanded <hi>Moses,</hi> to make the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> and all other holy <hi>Utensils</hi> appertaining to his solemn <hi>Service,</hi> together with his <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> concerning the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> who were to discharge those <hi>Holy Functions.</hi> Moreover, here is also recorded the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> in worshipping the <hi>Golden Calf;</hi> for which Crime <hi>GOD</hi> was resolved to destroy them, yet suffered himself at length to be entreated by <hi>Moses;</hi> who desiring to see the <hi>Face of GOD,</hi> was told by <hi>GOD,</hi> that <hi>no Man could see his face and live;</hi> but however, consented he should see his <hi>Back-parts,</hi> and to let his <hi>Glory</hi> pass before him.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>GOD</hi> again renewed his <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with the <hi>Israelites</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> a Faithful Servant in his <hi>House,</hi> whose <hi>Face</hi> hereupon became shining and radiant, insomuch as he was fain (whenever he spake to the <hi>People</hi>) to put a Veil upon his <hi>Face,</hi> because they were not able to bear the lustrous <hi>Glory</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from it. And in the Sequel of this <hi>Book, Moses</hi> specifies the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Offerings,</hi> which the <hi>People</hi> freely contributed to the Construction of the <hi>Tabernacle:</hi> Which being finish'd (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Command <hi>GOD</hi> had given to <hi>Moses,</hi> and in conformity to the <hi>Pattern</hi> he had shewed to him on the <hi>Mount</hi>) he anointed it, and was thereupon fill'd with the <hi>Glory of GOD.</hi> The <hi>LORD</hi> making it sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent throughout the course of these his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that the whole course of this <hi>Covenant</hi> was of pure <hi>Grace</hi> and free <hi>Bounty,</hi> founded upon the alone <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD</hi> in <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> who was the sole <hi>Mediator</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>So that this <hi>Book</hi> contains the <hi>History</hi> of what hapned to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> during the time of <hi>142</hi> years, or thereabouts (according to the Compute of some;) which is a most excellent Image of the State and Spiritual Deliverance of the <hi>Church</hi> by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the Bondage of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Corruption.</hi>

Whereupon this Faithful <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>LORD,</hi> having represented to them, That all these their Murmurings and Complaints did reflect upon <hi>GOD</hi> himself, he being only his <hi>Instrumont</hi> and <hi>Servant,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised them that <hi>GOD</hi> would grant their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and give them <hi>Meat:</hi> Accordingly the same Evening the <hi>LORD</hi> sent a prodigious Flight of <hi>Quails,</hi> which covered the <hi>Camp,</hi> and the next Morning sent them <hi>Manna</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> which like <hi>Dew</hi> covered all the Ground round about their <hi>Tents.</hi> And this miraculous <hi>Heavenly Bread,</hi> he afterwards continued to them during their forty years journying in the <hi>Wilderness.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were surpriz'd the next Morning to see this <hi>Divine Food</hi> spread over the Face of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and admiring what it might be; <hi>Moses</hi> told them, that it was the <hi>Bread</hi> that <hi>GOD</hi> sent them from <hi>Heaven;</hi> and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to go and gather it every Morning before the <hi>Sun-rising;</hi> to teach us, (as the Book of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> Chap. 16. ver. 28. saith,) <hi>That we must prevent the</hi> Sun-rising <hi>to give Thanks to GOD for all his Benefits, and pray unto him before break of Day;</hi> for as soon as the <hi>Sun</hi> was risen, it melted away, and was no more to be found. <hi>Moses</hi> also forbad them to keep any of it till the <hi>Morning, GOD</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing so early to teach the <hi>Jews,</hi> not to extend their care of necessary Supplies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the present Day, leaving the thoughts of the Morrow to the <hi>Divine Providence.</hi> And lastly he charged them, that for the more strict and religious Observation of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> they should gather the Day before a double quantity of <hi>Manna,</hi> which did not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie and breed <hi>Worms,</hi> as that which was on other days kept till the next Morning.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Figure</hi> doth most lively represent to us the <hi>Holy Eucharist,</hi> as <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself witnesseth in the <hi>Gospel;</hi> and we may boldly say, <hi>That how wonderful soever this Food of the</hi> Jews <hi>was, yet had not they in this, nor in any other of the miraculous Favours bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them any advantage beyond the</hi> Christians, <hi>who do more truly feed upon the</hi> Heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, <hi>and the</hi> Bread of Angels, <hi>which</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>gives to those who are come forth out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>that is, from the Corruptions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements of the</hi> World, <hi>and wherewith he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and supports them in the</hi> Wilderness <hi>of this</hi> Life, <hi>until they enter into the true</hi> Land <hi>of</hi> Promise, <hi>as the</hi> Jews <hi>were maintained with</hi> Manna, <hi>till their entring into</hi> Canaan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wherefore also,</hi> Christians <hi>ought to take great care to acknowledge and improve this Divine Grace and Favour better than the</hi> Jews <hi>did, and to tremble at the thought of falling into a distaste and dislike of this</hi> Heavenly Food, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Example: who though at the first view of this</hi> Miraculous Bread, <hi>they were struck with wonder, yet being once accustomed to it, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the</hi> Garlick <hi>and</hi> the Onions <hi>of</hi> Egypt <hi>before it.</hi>

                     <p>At the same time <hi>GOD</hi> called <hi>Moses</hi> to him from the top of the <hi>Mountain,</hi> which seem'd all on <hi>Fire,</hi> and the <hi>Smoke</hi> thereof ascended like the <hi>Smoke</hi> of a <hi>Furnace;</hi> but the <hi>People</hi> stood at a distance, and heard the <hi>Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> by his own Mouth delivered to them.

                           <hi>The same year,</hi> 2513.</note> and told them, he would present himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>GOD,</hi> and endeavour by his Intercession, to turn away the <hi>Divine Wrath,</hi> they had so justly deserved. He accordingly humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates himself before the <hi>LORD,</hi> as if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self were guilty of the <hi>Sin</hi> they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as one that durst not open his Mouth, to beg pardon for this their abominable <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But his <hi>Charity</hi> at last found out a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for this great Evil, he ranks himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these impious <hi>Criminals,</hi> and begs of <hi>GOD,</hi> that if there were no pardon for them, to blot him also out of his <hi>Book of Life:</hi> By this means he (as we may say) forc'd <hi>GOD,</hi> rather to pardon so many <hi>Criminals,</hi> for the sake of one Innocent Person, than to destroy one Innocent Person for the sake of so many <hi>Criminals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>GOD</hi> being overcome with the excess of <hi>Moses</hi> his Charity, sends him back again to the <hi>People,</hi> to tell them, that for the sake of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> and at his Intercession, he would give them the <hi>Land</hi> he had promised to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> but that he would not go up with them as formerly, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they were a <hi>stiffnecked People,</hi> lest he should be found to consume them by the way. And having commanded them to lay aside all their <hi>Ornaments,</hi> as a mark of their Repentance and Sorrow for this <hi>Sin</hi> they had committed, he orders <hi>Moses</hi> to hew out two <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>Stone,</hi> like to the former which he had broken.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Moses</hi> rose up early in the Morning, and went up to Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with the two <hi>Tables,</hi> and prostrating himself before the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, who descended in the <hi>Cloud</hi> on the top of the Mount, most humbly beseeched him to pardon the <hi>Sin</hi> of his <hi>People.</hi> The 2 <hi>LORD</hi> favourably received this his Intercession, and assur'd him of his Protection; and when he had continu'd there 40 <hi>Days</hi> and 40 <hi>Nights</hi> in Communion with <hi>GOD,</hi> without <hi>Meat</hi> or <hi>Drink,</hi> he returned to the <hi>People</hi> with the two <hi>Tables</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Moses</hi> was come down to the <hi>Camp,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were extreamly surpriz'd to see his <hi>Face</hi> all shining; and being affrighted with the glory they saw in his <hi>Countenance,</hi> they durst not come near him; which obliged himself to put a Veil on his <hi>Face,</hi> and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving called the <hi>Rulers</hi> and all the <hi>People</hi> to come to him, he declared what <hi>GOD</hi> had charged him with on their behalf.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Moses</hi> having attain'd to a degree of Glorification by his long continued Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Familiarity with <hi>GOD,</hi> was forced always to veil his <hi>Face</hi> when he came forth to the <hi>People,</hi> which he took off again when he went into the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> before the LORD, to speak with him. Whereby he gave to all the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> this <hi>Lesson, That they ought to proportion the</hi> Sacred Truths, <hi>GOD has been pleased to communicate to them, to the capacity and weakness of their</hi> Hearers; <hi>and to hide the Revelation of surpassing</hi> Mysteries, <hi>GOD has favoured them with, in the secret of their own Breasts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this manner were the two first <hi>Tables</hi> renewed, and <hi>GOD</hi> being touch'd with the punishment of his <hi>People,</hi> and the Intercession of <hi>Moses,</hi> wrote over again with his own Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the X. <hi>Commandments</hi> he before had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them. Which favour of his to the <hi>Jews</hi> was a <hi>Figure</hi> of a greater, he bestows upon all Penitent <hi>Souls,</hi> when upon their deep Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations, he by his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> anew en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves in their Hearts, the <hi>Holy Law</hi> they had before effaced by the disorder of their <hi>Lives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>GOD</hi> at the same time would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to <hi>Moses,</hi> how hard a thing it is to obtain this <hi>Grace,</hi> and therefore oblig'd him to hew these second <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>Stone</hi> himself, which was not mention'd concerning the first <hi>Tables.</hi> For <hi>Man</hi> is so weak, that he is apt to lose what he has obtain'd without labour and pains taking; and therefore <hi>GOD</hi> is constrained to make him endure a great deal of toil and trouble before his <hi>Holy Law</hi> be fully repaired and restored in him, to the end the difficulty he has met with in this Process, may oblige him to a greater watchfulness over himself, and make him tremble at the very thought of forfeiting a <hi>Favour,</hi> he has at length ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of <hi>GOD</hi> with so many Tears.</p>

                  <p>For in this <hi>Book</hi> are chiefly laid down the <hi>Ceremonial Laws,</hi> not only concerning all sorts of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> which are distinguished into <hi>Burnt-Offerings, Meat-Offerings, Offerings</hi> of the <hi>First-Fruits, Peace-Offerings,</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Trespass-Offerings,</hi> as well with regard to the <hi>Persons</hi> for whom they were offered, (as for the <hi>Priests,</hi> for the whole <hi>Congregation,</hi> for the <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Ruler,</hi> or for any of the <hi>People,</hi> and the Cases in which they were to be offered) as for Sins of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>wilful Sins,</hi> as to the <hi>Beasts,</hi> which were to be offered by distinguishing them into <hi>Clean</hi> and <hi>Unclean;</hi> with the <hi>Feasts</hi> and <hi>Days</hi> assigned to those several <hi>Services:</hi> As the Feast of the <hi>Passover,</hi> the Feast of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> the Feast of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> with the Feast of <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and the day of <hi>Atonement;</hi> together with the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> of the Seventh <hi>Year,</hi> and of the Year of <hi>Jubilee;</hi> but also concerning the <hi>Priests</hi> themselves, with respect to their <hi>Persons</hi> as well as <hi>Functions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, amongst these <hi>Ceremonial Laws,</hi> are those of the <hi>Purification of Women</hi> after <hi>Child-birth:</hi> Their <hi>Offerings</hi> at their <hi>Purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> The <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Tokens</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> is to observe in his Judgment about <hi>Leprosie,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> whereby it is to be cleansed; The <hi>Law</hi> concerning the <hi>Scape-Goat.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Amongst these <hi>Laws</hi> we find also several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations inserted, as of the Inauguration of the <hi>Priests,</hi> the Anointing of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and its <hi>Utensils,</hi> the actual Exercise of the <hi>Priestly Function,</hi> and its Confirmation by a Divine Prodigy of <hi>Fire</hi> coming down from <hi>Heaven</hi> and consuming the <hi>Burnt-Offerings</hi> on the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the Punishment of two Priests, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> who had transgressed the divinely appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Rules</hi> of their Sacred Employment, by offering <hi>Strange Fire</hi> before the <hi>Lord;</hi> together with the Execution of a <hi>Blasphemer.</hi>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AFter that <hi>Moses</hi> had finished all that <hi>GOD</hi> had commanded him to make for his <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>

This <hi>Cloud</hi> rested on the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> as long as it pleased GOD it should continue in the place where it was, and when it removed from the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> it was a Sign that the Divine Will was they should decamp, and remove elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>Thus we see that an orderly and regulated outward <hi>Service</hi> began to be performed to the <hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> by offering up of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> and other holy Observances appointed and determined by GOD himself, <hi>Aaron</hi> and his <hi>Sons</hi> being in particular set apart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated to these <hi>Holy Functions.</hi>

                     <p>But <hi>GOD</hi> soon made it appear, by a dreadful Example, what exactness he expects in the performance of those Holy Duties, and with what severity he required, that his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments should be obey'd.

                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Moses</hi> taking occasion from this sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and terrible <hi>Judgment,</hi> to make the rest of the <hi>Priests</hi> fearful of falling into the like <hi>Sin,</hi> made them bring the dead Bodies of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> from before the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and carry them out of the <hi>Camp,</hi> in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they found them, that is, in their <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Coats.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Moses</hi> also charged <hi>Aaron</hi> and his <hi>Sons,</hi> not to mourn for <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> in sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their <hi>Heads,</hi> or rending their <hi>Cloaths;</hi> but that they should leave those Marks of <hi>Mourning</hi> to the rest of the <hi>People,</hi> from whom they ought to distinguish themselves as well in this point as all the rest, in <hi>Reverence</hi> to that <hi>Holy Anointing,</hi> whereby they had been consecrated to the LORD, and separated from the rest of their <hi>Brethren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>GOD was willing to teach the <hi>Jews</hi> by this terrible <hi>Judgment,</hi> that the most holy seeming <hi>Service</hi> that Men offer to GOD, cannot in the least be acceptable to him, when it is not done in the way and manner he has appointed. The <hi>Divine Being</hi> is so wonderful and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent, that it is impossible to honour him, but according to his own Prescription; and the Model he himself hath set down. He does not now, (it may be) so visibly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably punish those who transgress his <hi>Holy Ordinances;</hi> but he no less takes notice, and observes at this time, those who bring a <hi>strange Fire</hi> to his <hi>Altar,</hi> and present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before him, having another <hi>Fire</hi> flaming in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> than what he has kindled there by his <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>

                     <p>This <hi>strange Fire</hi> which he has so great an aversion for, <hi>is</hi> (according to St. <hi>Gregory) the</hi> Love <hi>of this</hi> World, <hi>and that</hi> holy Man <hi>struck with the terrible Example shewed upon</hi> Nadab <hi>and</hi> Abihu, <hi>takes occasion earnestly to exhort all</hi> Believers, <hi>but especially those who serve at the</hi> Altar, <hi>to banish from their</hi> Hearts <hi>all</hi> unclean Lusts, <hi>and the love of</hi> Temporal things, <hi>to the end their</hi> Hearts <hi>may burn with the</hi> Love of GOD <hi>alone, who is a</hi> consuming Fire, <hi>and a</hi> jealous God; <hi>and who cannot suffer that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> strange Fire, <hi>should burn in the</hi> Hearts <hi>of those whom he has designed to be the</hi> Altars <hi>for his</hi> Holy Fire <hi>to burn upon continually.</hi>

                  <p>THis <hi>Book</hi> is called <hi>Numbers,</hi> because it contains the several <hi>Numbrings</hi> of the <hi>Tribes of Israel,</hi> performed in the <hi>Desert</hi> by the <hi>Command of GOD,</hi> and particularly of the <hi>Levites.</hi> But besides this <hi>Numbring</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistring</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> according to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Tribe,</hi> (but the <hi>Levites</hi> are exempted for the Service of the <hi>LORD,</hi> which both begin and conclude this <hi>Book</hi>) many other Matters are therein related. Here we find the <hi>Order,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which the <hi>12 Tribes</hi> were to march in their Journey, as well as to encamp themselves about the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is set down the Charge and Duty of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites;</hi> their <hi>Maintenance,</hi> and their miraculous <hi>Confirmation</hi> in the <hi>Priesthood.</hi> Here are Laws <hi>Ceremonial, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Civil,</hi> and <hi>Mixt.</hi> Herein is represented to us the wonderful and singular Conduct <hi>GOD</hi> was pleased to use towards them, in leading them through the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> to the Land of <hi>Promise.</hi> Here are also related several Events, that hapned in their <hi>Journey,</hi> the Occasions, Circumstances, and Success whereof, afford us many good <hi>Lessons,</hi> as well in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> as <hi>Civil Matters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We see here, that after the setting up and Consecration of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> the <hi>Heads</hi> or <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Twelve Tribes,</hi> severally brought their <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Offerings;</hi> and how that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful <hi>People</hi> were oft engaged in <hi>Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> and <hi>Rebellions</hi> against the <hi>LORD,</hi> and against <hi>Moses,</hi> together with the dreadful <hi>Examples</hi> of terrible <hi>Judgments</hi> that succeeded them.</p>
                  <p>We read here also, how <hi>Moses</hi> was eased of the burthen of his solitary <hi>Administration,</hi> by the Assistance of <hi>Seventy Elders;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which, he meets with much trouble both from <hi>Aaron</hi> his <hi>Brother,</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> his <hi>Sister;</hi> as also, how he having sent some to discover the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> by reason of the ill <hi>Report</hi> of the <hi>Spies,</hi> and the <hi>Murmurings</hi> thence occasioned amongst the <hi>People,</hi> several <hi>Judgments</hi> were inflicted on them, whereby some immediately perished, the rest being sentenc'd to wander up and down in the <hi>Wilderness</hi> forty <hi>Years</hi> from their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to die in it at last.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Book</hi> likewise are recorded several <hi>Sins</hi> both particular and common with their just <hi>Punishments,</hi> as well as the <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Heroick Actions</hi> of good Men, with their particular Rewards. Moreover, the infinite <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> is excellently set forth here, in his favourable acceptance of the <hi>Prayers</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> his faithful Servant; in the gracious <hi>pardoning</hi> of so many <hi>Crimes</hi> of such rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and seditious Persons, and in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pouring forth of his multiplied <hi>Blessings</hi> upon that <hi>People;</hi> whereof some were <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> in preserving the <hi>Truth</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>Purity</hi> of his <hi>Service</hi> amongst them; and others <hi>Corporal,</hi> in delivering them from the hands of their <hi>Enemies,</hi> in giving them glorious <hi>Victories</hi> over them, and in graciously heaping upon them many other temporal <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</hi>

                           <hi>The same Year</hi> 2514.</note> how dangerous a thing it is for those that minister at the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> to neglect the <hi>Rules</hi> of their <hi>holy Function,</hi> and to disobey him, whose more immediate <hi>Ministers</hi> they are; he gave another Example of the exactness of his <hi>Justice</hi> towards the <hi>Common People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two <hi>Jews</hi> quarrelling together, one of them in his transport of Rage and Choler blasphemed the Holy Name of GOD; the <hi>Ears</hi> of those that heard him being offended at those detestable <hi>Words,</hi> they seiz'd the <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> and brought him before <hi>Moses,</hi> who would not pronounce or determine any thing in the case, till he had enquired of <hi>GOD</hi> what was fit to be done.</p>
                     <p>GOD, in answer to his demand, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to put the <hi>Blasphemer</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the <hi>Camp,</hi> and that those who had heard his <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> should lay their <hi>Hands</hi> on his <hi>Head,</hi> and that afterwards all the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> should <hi>stone</hi> him. This Order was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly forthwith executed with a Severity, which at this time may make all those trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who are not afraid in their Passion to <hi>blaspheme</hi> that <hi>Holy Name;</hi> as well as make those blush, who are so regardless of the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> as to suffer and wink at those that do it. And upon this occasion, <hi>GOD</hi> made a <hi>Law, That all</hi> Blasphemers, <hi>for time to come, should be stoned by the People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some time after their hapned another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Divine Justice</hi> and <hi>Severity.</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> being very exact in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward observance of the Holiness of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day,</hi> in which <hi>GOD</hi> had commanded them, but a while ago, with his own Mouth, not to do any <hi>servile Work,</hi> they chanc'd to find a <hi>Man</hi> gathering <hi>Sticks</hi> on that day, and brought him before <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> to pass Sentence upon him for that Transgression of the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> who ordered him to be put in Ward, till they had consulted the Will of <hi>GOD</hi> in that Matter.</p>
                     <p>After Enquiry, GOD commanded them to proceed (as in the foregoing Instance) <hi>viz.</hi> to bring the <hi>Sabbath-breaker</hi> without the <hi>Camp,</hi> and that all the <hi>People</hi> should stone him there.</p>
                     <p>Men <hi>at this time would take more care, and be more exact in keeping the</hi> Laws of GOD, <hi>if they saw themselves threatned with present</hi> Death, <hi>upon the breach of them; and the fear at least of so sudden and so severe a Punishment would put a stop to their rash</hi> Licentiousness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But those who have learnt to obey the</hi> Law of GOD <hi>from a Principle of</hi> Love, <hi>and not from any fear of</hi> Punishments, <hi>cannot sufficiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail and lament to see the</hi> Liberty <hi>those that call themselves</hi> Christians <hi>take, to violate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear or Care, the most sacred and inviolable</hi> Laws <hi>and</hi> Commands <hi>of</hi> GOD.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Their</hi> Faith <hi>presents them with a view of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Punishments, <hi>and much more to be feared than all Temporal</hi> Punishments <hi>whatsoever.

                     </p>
                     <p>GOD <hi>never slackens the Severity of his</hi> Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>He has once declared to</hi> Men, <hi>what he would have them do, and what he expects from them; and having so done, speaks no more, but leaves it to them, and if they be disobedient, 'tis at their own peril.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Men <hi>indeed may deceive themselves, and wrest the</hi> Law of GOD <hi>to their own Sense, and as they would fain have it; but however they may flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themselves, as this</hi> Sabbath-breaker <hi>probably also did: For what hurt was there in gathering a few</hi> Sticks? <hi>yet their excusing and acquitting of themselves will not prevent the Sentence of</hi> Death <hi>from being pronounced against them: And they will know, but alas too late</hi> (as saith St. <hi>Austin) That Man was vain in his</hi> Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>but that</hi> GOD <hi>was true in his Threats and Menaces.</hi>

                     <p>THE severity of so many <hi>Chastisements,</hi> wherewith <hi>GOD</hi> exercised his <hi>People</hi> in so many different manners, was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to put a stop to their Rebellious Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Moses,</hi> tho' he was sensible of the injustice of these their Reproaches, yet preserving his accustomed <hi>Meekness,</hi> seem'd not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at it.

                        <hi>Moses</hi> being afflicted to see his <hi>Sister</hi> in that condition, earnestly prayed to the <hi>LORD</hi> to heal her; but <hi>GOD</hi> told him it was but fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that for the fault she had committed, she should be put forth of the <hi>Camp</hi> 7 days, after which she was healed, according to the Intercession of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This particular Murmuring of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> against <hi>Moses</hi> being past, there soon arose another of the whole <hi>People:</hi> For <hi>GOD</hi> having commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to send a Man of each <hi>Tribe,</hi> to search the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to bring a Sample of the <hi>Fruits</hi> thereof, these <hi>Spies</hi> returned and brought a bunch of <hi>Grapes,</hi> which was an abundant proof of the excellency of the Soil: But withal told them, that the Land was inhabited by so Giant-like a <hi>People,</hi> that they could not think ever to conquer them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>People</hi> had no sooner heard this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging account from the <hi>Spies,</hi> but they began with one accord to murmur against <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi> They wish they had died in the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> rather than to be put upon fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Giants;</hi> and at last came to that wicked Resolution, to choose themselves a <hi>Leader,</hi> and return to <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> seeing them lash out into these detestable Exorbitances, prostrated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before the <hi>LORD,</hi> to appease his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from breaking out upon them; whilst in the mean time <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshuah</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by mild words, and encouraging Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of the <hi>Land,</hi> to calm them, and to efface the <hi>fears</hi> which these false reports had raised in them. They assured them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was a very excellent <hi>Land,</hi> and that as long as <hi>GOD</hi> favoured them, they should easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Masters thereof.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>People</hi> being strangely enraged, instead of giving ear to their Remonstrances, would needs have <hi>stoned</hi> them, had not they been stopt by the appearance of the <hi>Glory</hi> of the LORD, in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;</hi> whence the LORD spake to <hi>Moses,</hi> commanding him to tell the <hi>People,</hi> that he had heard their <hi>murmurings,</hi> and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their wishes he would deal with them; for as they had wished to die in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> so they should all of them from 20 years old and upwards.</p>

                     <p>This done, <hi>Korah</hi> and his Party placed themselves on one side, and <hi>Aaron</hi> on the other; and at the same time the <hi>Glory</hi> of the LORD appeared to all the <hi>Congregation,</hi> and the LORD commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to bid the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> to get them away from those Rebellious Murmerers. <hi>Moses</hi> having given this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement to the <hi>People,</hi> told them, that GOD would now give them an undoubted proof, that he had done nothing but by express Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from him; and that the extraordinary death of these Rebels, would justifie them in the eyes of them all.</p>
                     <p>Scarce had <hi>Moses</hi> made an end of speaking to the <hi>People,</hi> when the <hi>Earth</hi> opened and swallowed them, and all that belonged to them.

                     <p>At the same time a <hi>Fire</hi> came forth from <hi>GOD</hi> and consumed the 250 Partisans of <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>'s Rebellion. <hi>Moses,</hi> by command from the LORD, order'd their <hi>Censers</hi> to be taken up, and beat into <hi>Plates,</hi> to cover the <hi>Altar,</hi> that they might be an eternal Monument of this severe Vengeance, and a warning to all, not to attempt the like for the future.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Balaam</hi> the <hi>False Prophet</hi> blesseth the <hi>People of GOD</hi> against his Will, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that King <hi>Balak</hi> had sent for him to curse them. His <hi>Ass</hi> reproves him for beating her, because she stopt at the sight of an <hi>Angel,</hi> which <hi>Balaam</hi> perceived not.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AFTER so many Afflictions and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which <hi>Moses</hi> had been tryed with,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2553. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1451.</note> in his Leading of the <hi>People;</hi> for a last proof of his Constancy, he was a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death to be exercised with Tryals, caused by the Artifices of a <hi>false Prophet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Israelites</hi> being encamp'd near to the borders of <hi>Moab, Balak</hi> their <hi>King</hi> terrifyed at their approach, sends for <hi>Balaam</hi> to curse <hi>Israel. Balaam</hi> in the Night time asks Counsel of <hi>GOD,</hi> what he should do; who strictly forbad him to undertake any such thing, forasmuch as he himself had blessed them: whereupon <hi>Balaam</hi> dismisses the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Balak</hi> had sent to fetch him, with this Answer. But this <hi>Prince</hi> being resolved not to be put off so, sends other more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Persons to <hi>Balaam,</hi> and with richer Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents.</p>
                     <p>The covetousness of this <hi>false Prophet</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awakened at the sight of these <hi>Presents,</hi> instead of firmly acquiescing in the first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <hi>GOD</hi> had given him, demanded again of <hi>GOD,</hi> whether he should go along with them, as if the <hi>Gold</hi> of these second <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors</hi> could have the same power upon <hi>GOD,</hi> as it had on his Covetous Heart. So <hi>GOD</hi> leaving him to his desires, bad him go along with them. And as he was on the way, the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> met him and oppos'd him; yet <hi>Balaam</hi> did not see him; but the <hi>Ass</hi> on which he rode, saw the <hi>Angel,</hi> and stopping, fell down under him; and as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> in a rage smote the <hi>Ass, GOD</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Mouth, she complain'd of his unjust Cruelty.</p>
                     <p>At the same time also the <hi>LORD</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Balaams</hi> Eyes, and he saw the <hi>Angel</hi> standing in the way, and as he threatned to kill him, <hi>Balaam</hi> humbled himself before the <hi>Angel</hi> of the LORD; and told him, that if his <hi>Journey</hi> were displeasing to him, he was ready to return back again. But the <hi>Angel</hi> gave him leave to continue his <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> only charged him to speak nothing, but what he received from GOD. And accordingly he did; for notwithstanding all the Perswasions and Promises of <hi>Balak</hi> to make him curse <hi>Israel,</hi> GOD made him to bless them; which extreamly provoked that <hi>King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Balaam</hi> being afraid of losing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he expected from <hi>Balak,</hi> made him endeavour by his Counsel, to destroy and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the blessings he had pronounced to that <hi>People:</hi> For casting off his disguise of a true <hi>Prophet,</hi> he (like a wicked wretch) advised <hi>Balak</hi> to tempt the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> with the <hi>Moabitish Women,</hi> that being inveigled by them, and worshiping their <hi>Idols,</hi> GOD might in his Wrath deliver them into the hands of their Enemies.</p>
                     <p>This Advice of his had a most fatal suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; for these <hi>Idolatrous Women,</hi> by their Allurements, soon gain'd this easie People, to defile their <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> with them.</p>
                     <p>Thus one <hi>false Prophet,</hi> who pretended to be a Man of <hi>God,</hi> was like (by his Artifices and Covetousness) to have been the cause of the ruin and destruction of all <hi>Gods People,</hi> if a true <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> had not opposed it with an holy and highly commendable Zeal: For <hi>Phineas,</hi> the Grandson of <hi>Aaron,</hi> seeing a <hi>Jew</hi> committing lewdness with a <hi>Moabitish Woman,</hi> thrust them both through with his <hi>Sword,</hi> by which means the <hi>Plague</hi> was stayed, which the Wrath of <hi>God</hi> had kindled amongst them, whereof 24000 died.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>then</hi> (as saith S. <hi>Ambrose) were more miraculously delivered by one true</hi> Priest, <hi>than they had before been corrupted by one</hi> False Prophet; <hi>and the</hi> Zeal <hi>and</hi> Piety <hi>of the one was of greater force, than the</hi> Avarice <hi>or</hi> Artifices <hi>of the other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We find here, that the</hi> People of God <hi>are happy, when they have Persons amongst them, who by a wise zeal oppose the designs of those that would corrupt them. There will be always</hi> Balaams <hi>in the</hi> Church, <hi>that is,</hi> false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>who seek their own Interests, and not those of</hi> Jesus Christ. <hi>Wherefore it is greatly to be wish'd for, that the</hi> Church <hi>may not want such as</hi> Phineas, <hi>who were sensible of the least Evil that threatens it, and who aim at nothing but the</hi> Glory of God, <hi>and the</hi> Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of his</hi> People.</p>

It is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain who was the <hi>Penman</hi> of it; some think by some <hi>Prophet</hi> that lived after; others, by <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> the <hi>High-Priest;</hi> and others (with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability) by <hi>Joshua</hi> himself, except that part which concludes the <hi>Book</hi> concerning his own <hi>Death</hi> and that of <hi>Eleazar, GOD</hi> having made use of him, as an Instrument to execute the great things herein related; and having also inspired and guided him by his <hi>Spirit</hi> in the recording of them, for edifying of the <hi>Church.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Neither was he deceived in this his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; for these 12000 <hi>Men</hi> did entirely defeat the <hi>Midianites</hi> and their <hi>Princes,</hi> kill'd <hi>Balaam,</hi> who had been the Author of that detestable <hi>Counsel,</hi> burnt all their <hi>Cities,</hi> took their <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>little ones Captives,</hi> and the Spoil of all their <hi>Cattel</hi> and <hi>Goods.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this <hi>Victory</hi> thus obtain'd, <hi>Moses</hi> went out to meet the <hi>Army,</hi> and seeing that they had spared the <hi>Women,</hi> he was very angry with the <hi>Officers</hi> for not killing them, who had been the chief Cause of their <hi>Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and whom <hi>Balaam</hi> had made use of to ruin them. And therefore commanded them to kill all the <hi>male Children,</hi> and all the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> saving none alive but such as were <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins;</hi> of whom there were found to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 32000.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moses</hi> afterwards gave to the Tribes of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> with the half Tribe of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> a Possession on that side of <hi>Jordan:</hi> And because he was not to pass over that <hi>River,</hi> GOD commanded him to send for <hi>Joshua,</hi> and to give him the Charge of that <hi>Great People;</hi> which he did accordingly, and with many Words exhorted him, to be strong and of good Courage, in leading the <hi>People</hi> into the <hi>Land,</hi> which the LORD had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to them for an Inheritance for ever. He also by many reiterated Discourses, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the <hi>People</hi> the sum and substance of what GOD had order'd him to command them, in his Name, for the space of 40 <hi>Years,</hi> which he afterwards wrote down in a Book, which was put into the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> together with the <hi>Tables</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, Having <hi>blest</hi> the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> he went up to Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> to the top of <hi>Pisgah,</hi> which is over-against <hi>Jericho,</hi> where the <hi>Lord</hi> gave him a View of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that is, all the Land of <hi>Gilead</hi> unto <hi>

                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>His Faithfulness in his <hi>Ministry</hi> has been admir'd by all <hi>Saints.</hi> He rendred to GOD all that was his due, without omitting any part of his Duty to the <hi>People,</hi> and discharged his <hi>Function</hi> with respect to the <hi>People,</hi> without failing in that which he owed to <hi>GOD:</hi> His <hi>Life</hi> was made up of danger and continual toil and labour, and it ended in a <hi>Death</hi> which was a kind of <hi>Chastisement,</hi> and by which it seem'd, as if <hi>GOD</hi> had a mind to <hi>purifie</hi> the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> of that <hi>great Prophet</hi> to the highest degree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Yet let us not think</hi> (saith S. <hi>Austin) that GOD would punish this his faithful Servant in his Anger, or that it was any great Evil for</hi> Moses <hi>to die at the Age of</hi> 120 <hi>Years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entring into a</hi> Land, <hi>where so many wicked</hi> Men <hi>entred after his</hi> Death. <hi>He whom</hi> GOD <hi>thought worthy to see his Face one day in</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>could he think himself unhappy for not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into that</hi> Land, <hi>which was only an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Image <hi>of it?</hi>

                        <hi>MOSES</hi> being <hi>dead,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> promised to obey <hi>Joshua</hi> in all things, whom <hi>GOD</hi> magnified in the sight of them all,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2553 <hi>the first Month of the</hi> 41<hi>st year after their coming out of</hi> Egypt.</note> by their Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Passage over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Jordan;</hi> which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in this manner:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joshua</hi> rose early in the Morning, and they moved from <hi>Shittim,</hi> and came to <hi>Jordan,</hi> he and all the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and lodged there before they passed over; and <hi>Joshua</hi> having assembled the <hi>People,</hi> commanded them to put themselves in a readiness to pass the River <hi>Jordan</hi> after three days, and on the 4th day the Officers went through the <hi>Host,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the <hi>People,</hi> saying, <hi>When ye see the</hi> Ark <hi>of the</hi> Covenant <hi>of the</hi> LORD <hi>your</hi> GOD, <hi>and the</hi> Priests <hi>and</hi> Levites <hi>bearing it, that ye shall remove from your place, and go after it, yet so as to keep a distance of</hi> 2000 Cubits <hi>from it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this <hi>Joshua</hi> commanded the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> that bare the <hi>Ark,</hi> to enter into the <hi>River,</hi> and to make a halt at the Brink of it. <hi>Jordan</hi> had no sooner perceiv'd the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the <hi>Ark,</hi> but the <hi>Waters</hi> which were below the <hi>Priests Feet,</hi> took their ordinary course to the <hi>Dead Sea;</hi> but those who were above them ran back towards their rise; and stood on heaps like a <hi>Mountain.</hi> Thus the <hi>People</hi> passed the <hi>River</hi> dry-shod, the <hi>Priests</hi> continuing in the <hi>River</hi> with the <hi>Ark</hi> till all the <hi>People</hi> were passed over.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joshua,</hi> who had learnt of <hi>Moses,</hi> of how great importance it is, to testifie our grateful Acknowledgments to <hi>GOD,</hi> for the Favours we receive from him, would not that this miraculous Assistance (GOD had afforded them) should be pass'd over without leaving an eternal Monument of their Gratitude to the <hi>Divine Majesty.</hi> Accordingly he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded twelve chosen <hi>Men</hi> out of the twelve <hi>Tribes,</hi> to take each of them a <hi>Stone</hi> out of the midst of the <hi>River,</hi> in the very place where the <hi>Priests</hi> stood whilst the <hi>People</hi> past over; and that with those twelve <hi>Stones</hi> they should erect an <hi>Altar,</hi> to serve for a Memorial to all Posterity, of that miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Passage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides this, <hi>Joshua</hi> order'd also 12 <hi>Stones</hi> to be set up in the midst of the <hi>River Jordan,</hi> in the place where the Feet of the <hi>Priests</hi> (which bear the <hi>Ark of the Covenant</hi>) stood, which continued there ever after. When these Orders were thus executed, and that all the <hi>People,</hi> and what belonged to them, were come over, <hi>Joshua</hi> commanded the <hi>Priests</hi> that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the <hi>Ark</hi> to pass over also; who no sooner had set their Feet upon dry <hi>Land</hi> but the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of <hi>Jordan</hi> (which had been thus long ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested by the Omnipotent Hand of <hi>GOD</hi>) fell down with Violence, and took their accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Course to the <hi>Dead Sea.</hi> And thus <hi>GOD</hi> (by this great and stupendious <hi>Miracle</hi>) mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified <hi>Joshua</hi> in the Eyes of all the <hi>People.</hi>

                     <p>THE first City that was to be mastered (after the passing of the <hi>River Jordan,</hi> was <hi>Jericho,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The same Year</hi> 2553. <hi>before J.

                     <p>These <hi>Spies</hi> being return'd to <hi>Joshua,</hi> did not like those which <hi>Moses</hi> had sent 40 years before, discourage the People by their Report; but on the contrary greatly encouraged their <hi>Brethren,</hi> by telling them, that the City of <hi>Jericho</hi> was in so great a consternation, that it might be look'd upon as already theirs. The Fright wherewith they were seiz'd at the approach of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and the Report they had heard of so many <hi>Miracles</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> had wrought in favour of them, made them very careful to secure themselves by all possible Precautions, and supposing none more conducive to that end, than the strength of their <hi>Walls</hi> they endeavour'd to make them impregnable.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>GOD</hi> shewed <hi>Joshua</hi> a way, whereby (without any <hi>Machines</hi> or <hi>Violence</hi> used) he should lay their <hi>Walls</hi> level with the ground. He commanded him to make all the People to compass the <hi>City</hi> for seven days together, the <hi>Priests</hi> going before them and blowing their <hi>Trumpets;</hi> that on the seventh day, when the <hi>Priests</hi> sounded louder and shriller than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, all the People should answer them with a great <hi>Shout,</hi> promising him, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately thereupon the <hi>Walls</hi> of <hi>Jericho</hi> should fall flat to the Ground; which came to pass accordingly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GOD</hi> charged <hi>Joshua</hi> also, that they should not meddle with any thing that was in the <hi>City;</hi> but it should be look'd upon as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed; which <hi>Joshua</hi> gave also in strict charge to the People, lest any of them, by their Covetousness, might be the cause of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the whole <hi>Congregation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He took care also to put the People in mind of saving <hi>Rahab,</hi> and recommended that matter to the <hi>Spies,</hi> whose <hi>Lives</hi> she had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to secure her and all that belonged to her, and to bring her to the <hi>Camp,</hi> where she might meet with the same Kindness she had before shewed to them.</p>
                     <p>This was the end of <hi>Jericho</hi> and her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who trusted in the height and strength of their <hi>Walls,</hi> saw them to their unexpressible astonishment laid level with the Ground, at the sound of <hi>Rams-horns,</hi> and the Shouts of the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Miracle</hi> was the <hi>Figure</hi> of a Mystery the <hi>Fathers</hi> oft insist upon: They tell us, that the sound of these <hi>Trumpets</hi> very lively sets forth to us, the sound of the <hi>Preachers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which at the same time cause a Joy in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of all true <hi>Israelites;</hi> but strike with Terror and Amazement all such as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them.</p>

                        <hi>Nothing</hi> (saith St. <hi>Ambrose) contributes more to the making of the</hi> People <hi>of</hi> GOD <hi>victorious over their</hi> Enemies, <hi>than when care is taken to animate them by the preaching of the</hi> Word <hi>of</hi> GOD, <hi>and by the Sound of the</hi> Trumpets <hi>of</hi> Jubilee; <hi>that is of the</hi> Grace of GGD <hi>in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning their</hi> Sins. <hi>This</hi> holy Joy, <hi>shed abroad in their</hi> Souls <hi>and</hi> Hearts, <hi>by the preaching of the</hi> Word, <hi>is all their strength, as the</hi> holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>witness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Jericho <hi>continued impregnable, as long as the</hi> Priests <hi>were silent; but when once they began to blow their</hi> Trumpets, <hi>and that the</hi> People <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd them by their Shouts of</hi> Joy, <hi>immediately her proud</hi> Walls <hi>and lofty</hi> Towers <hi>were levell'd with the Ground.</hi>

                           <hi>The same year,</hi> 2553.</note> some of the <hi>Officers</hi> represented to <hi>Joshua,</hi> that it was needless to employ the whole <hi>Army</hi> to take so inconsiderable a place, two or three thousand Men being a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity for that service.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joshua</hi> satisfied with their Reasons, gave order accordingly; but he was strangely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, when expecting to see his <hi>Troops</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Victorious, he had the News brought him of their Defeat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joshua</hi> being wonderfully afflicted with this Disaster, rent his <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and prostrated himself before the <hi>LORD,</hi> and not being able to bear this disgrace his People had sustained, which reflected upon <hi>GOD</hi> himself, he (in the bitterness of his Soul) made his Complaints thereof to <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>Prayer;</hi> who answered him, that the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> had been the cause of this their shameful Defeat, and that the <hi>Accursed Thing</hi> which was in the midst of them, had made him withdraw his favourable Assistance, and thereby expos'd them to their <hi>Enemies;</hi> that therefore he should take care to sanctifie the People, and to remove the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed Thing</hi> from amongst them, that he might afford them his <hi>Protection,</hi> as formerly.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon <hi>Joshua</hi> assembled the People, and having acquainted them with the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Defeat, he ordered <hi>Lots</hi> to be cast, and the <hi>Lot</hi> fell on the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and amongst all the Families of that <hi>Tribe,</hi> it fell upon the Family of <hi>Zerah,</hi> and at last upon <hi>Achan,</hi> whom <hi>Joshua</hi> exhorted to confess the Fact, and give glory to <hi>GOD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Achan</hi> seeing his Crime so miraculously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, thought it was to no purpose any longer to conceal any thing; he confest (at the taking of <hi>Jericho</hi>) he had been tempted to take a goodly <hi>Babylonish Garment,</hi> with two hundred <hi>Shekels</hi> of <hi>Silver,</hi> and a Wedge of <hi>Gold,</hi> which he had hid in his <hi>Tent</hi> under ground: So <hi>Joshua</hi> sent some to fetch the things he had mentioned from thence, which was done accordingly; and at the same time ordered <hi>Achan,</hi> with his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and all that he had, to be brought to the Valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> where they were <hi>stoned,</hi> and their <hi>Bodies,</hi> and all that belong'd to them, afterwards burnt with <hi>Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GOD</hi>'s Wrath being appeased by this Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, he commanded <hi>Joshua</hi> to go up and take <hi>Hai,</hi> and advised him to lay an <hi>Ambush</hi> behind the <hi>City,</hi> and then to go forth with the rest of his <hi>Army,</hi> and be a feigned Flight, to draw the Inhabitants out of the <hi>City,</hi> that they might be enclosed between the <hi>Ambush</hi> and the <hi>Body of his Army.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Stratagem had an answerable Success, for the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> transported with Joy to see the <hi>Israelites</hi> flee before them, left the <hi>City</hi> to pursue them; but soon after looking back and seeing their <hi>City</hi> on Fire, and themselves enclosed between their <hi>Enemies,</hi> their Hearts failed them, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> returning upon them, destroyed them, not leaving one alive.</p>
                     <p>Thus the loss and disgrace of <hi>GOD</hi>'s Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was repaired by the Death of <hi>Achan,</hi> whose Covetousness had prov'd so fatal to many.</p>

                     <p>But the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> (better advis'd than the rest) foresaw the insignificancy of all these their <hi>Leagues</hi> and <hi>Confederacies,</hi> by reason of the miraculous <hi>Successes</hi> always attending that People; and therefore not trusting in their Strength, they make use of their Wits; and accoutring some of their <hi>Inhabitants</hi> in old <hi>Habiliments,</hi> they sent them to <hi>Joshua;</hi> who appearing before him, pretended themselves to be <hi>Ambassadors</hi> come from a far <hi>Country,</hi> to make a <hi>League</hi> with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joshua</hi> at first, seeming to suspect some Deceit, enquir'd from whence they came; but they continuing in their former Story, (for proof whereof they shewed their old <hi>Shoes,</hi> mouldy <hi>Bread,</hi> and worn <hi>Garments</hi>) he was at last persuaded to make peace with them. Thus without asking Counsel of the LORD, he made a League with them, and confirm'd it by <hi>Oath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Three days after this <hi>Imposture</hi> was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> finding that they were their Neighbour, began to murmur against the <hi>Princes,</hi> who had concluded the League, and would needs have exterminated them notwithstanding, had not <hi>Joshua</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> represented to them the <hi>Sacredness</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> they had sworn to them. So <hi>Joshua</hi> only condemned them to perpetual Servitude, making them <hi>Hewers of Wood,</hi> and <hi>Drawers of Water,</hi> for the service of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and the whole <hi>Congregation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> had no sooner by Craft thus saved themselves from the hands of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> but they were ready to be made a Victim to their Neighbours Revenge, if <hi>Joshua</hi> himself had not timely come to their assistance. For <hi>Adoni-zedek</hi> King of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> hearing that the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> had made Peace with <hi>Israel,</hi> began to consider them as Enemies, and the rather, because <hi>Gibeon</hi> was a great <hi>City,</hi> and the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> Men of Valour; wherefore he sent unto four of his Neighbour <hi>Kings,</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to joyn their Forces with him, in order to destroy the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who had no other Refuge in this their extremity, except that of <hi>Joshua</hi>'s kindness, and the Courage of the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither were they deceiv'd in their Hopes; for <hi>Joshua</hi> being inform'd of their Design, marched to their assistance, and defeated the five <hi>Kings;</hi> and because the declining of the Day was like to have hindred them from a further pursuit, <hi>Joshua</hi> commanded the <hi>Sun</hi> to stand still till he had avenged himself of his <hi>Enemies;</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> immediately obeyed by a <hi>Miracle</hi> (unparallel'd before or after) and hasted not to go down till they had utterly defeated all their <hi>Enemies;</hi> for the LORD hearkned to the Voice of his <hi>Servant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Men <hi>are apt to admire these outward</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, (say the <hi>Fathers) and that not without reason, forasmuch as they are visible Instances of the</hi> Divine Omnipotence. <hi>The</hi> Sun (saith S. <hi>Ambrose) acknowledg'd in</hi> Joshua <hi>the Power of</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>who many Ages after was to make the true</hi> Sun <hi>stand-still; that is to say, the Light and Heat of</hi> Truth, <hi>which was decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning very fast, and ready to be for ever extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd, and to leave the</hi> World <hi>expos'd to the horrour of</hi> Eternal Darkness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But we are not to look for these sensible</hi> Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <hi>in the</hi> Church <hi>now; the</hi> Pastors <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>do not now endeavour to stop the Course of the</hi> Sun <hi>in the</hi> Heavens, <hi>but the Course of</hi> Concupiscence <hi>in the</hi> Heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of what avail was it to</hi> Joshua (saith that <hi>Father) to stop the great Light of</hi> Heaven, <hi>when at the same time he could not repress</hi> Covetousness <hi>upon</hi> Earth? <hi>He commanded, and the</hi> Sun <hi>obey'd, that he might have time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute his</hi> Victory; <hi>but he could not command the</hi> Covetousness <hi>of</hi> Achan, <hi>who lost him a</hi> Victory, <hi>and made his</hi> Army <hi>shamefully to flee before their</hi> Enemies. <hi>We cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this is one of the greatest</hi> Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <hi>of the</hi> Old Law; <hi>but those of the</hi> New, <hi>tho' they do not so much dazle the outward</hi> Eye, <hi>yet they are incomparably greater.

                  <head>The CONTENTS of the Book of JUDGES.</head>
                  <p>THis <hi>Book</hi> contains an excellent <hi>History</hi> of the state of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as well <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> as <hi>Civil,</hi> from the Death of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi> till the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>High-Priesthood</hi> of <hi>Eli,</hi> under the Conduct of the <hi>JUDGES,</hi> so called, not because they exercised the ordinary Jurisdiction amongst the <hi>People</hi> (as commonly the word <hi>JUDGE</hi> imports;) but because they were extraordinarily raised up by <hi>GOD,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the present state of things requir'd it (sometimes out of one <hi>Tribe,</hi> sometimes out of another) and endowed with his Spirit of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> to maintain his <hi>Rights,</hi> and those of his <hi>People,</hi> and victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to vindicate and assert them from the Injustice and Tyranny of their <hi>Oppressors,</hi> as likewise to restore the Purity of his <hi>Worship,</hi> when it was alter'd or corrupted, to defend their <hi>Liberties,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Law</hi> they had received from <hi>GOD,</hi> and to assist them with Counsel and Deed, in all their Difficulties and Exigences.</p>
                  <p>First of all therefore, in this <hi>Book</hi> are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the several <hi>Wars</hi> the <hi>Israelites</hi> were engag'd in after <hi>Joshua</hi>'s <hi>Death,</hi> by the express command of <hi>GOD,</hi> against the <hi>Gentil</hi> Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, yet remaining in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in order to their utter destruction and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; in which case they for the most part were so backward and neglectful, that the <hi>LORD</hi> being offended thereat, suffer'd many of those <hi>Gentil Nations</hi> to remain in the <hi>Land,</hi> for a Trial and Punishment of his <hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>True it is, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> for a long while retain'd the Purity of the <hi>Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> amongst them, as long as those brave and pious <hi>Elders</hi> lived, who had been Eye-witnesses of the miraculous <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>LORD,</hi> by the hand of <hi>Joshua;</hi> but after their Death we find here recorded, how the <hi>People</hi> abusing their Liberty, Peace and Prosperity, fell from time to time into <hi>Heathen Idolatry,</hi> and a most prodigious corruption of <hi>Manners,</hi> as is oft mention'd in this <hi>Book,</hi> not only in general terms, but whereof also several abominable and tragical instances are set down in the <hi>17, 18, 19</hi> and <hi>20th Chapters,</hi> to serve as a <hi>Mirror,</hi> not only of the Wickedness and Corruption of that <hi>People,</hi> but likewise of the just indignation of GOD, and the severity of his <hi>Vengeance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover here is set forth, how that <hi>GOD</hi> being provoked at the frequent Backsliding of his <hi>People,</hi> did most sharply reprove, and severely punish them, actually delivering them up into the hands of divers of their <hi>Enemies;</hi> as of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi> King of <hi>Mesopotamia, Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab, Jabin</hi> King of the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> also into the hands of the <hi>Philistins;</hi> of the <hi>Midianites, Amalekites,</hi> and other Eastern People; and of the <hi>Ammonites, &amp;c.</hi> who for a long time afflicted and oppressed <hi>Israel.</hi> But yet notwithstanding, when they in their anguish and sore distress did seriously return to the <hi>LORD</hi> (renouncing their <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Perversness,</hi> groaned after him, and fervently call'd upon him for his <hi>Grace</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Assistance</hi>) he was mov'd with <hi>Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> shewing himself as true and faithful in performing his <hi>Promises,</hi> as he had been in executing his <hi>Threats</hi> and <hi>Menaces,</hi> and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times delivered them by the Hand of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Instruments of his own raising; such as were <hi>Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak, Gideon, Jephtha</hi> and <hi>Sampson.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as they soon after forgat these signal <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances</hi> the <hi>LORD</hi> had wrought for them, and returned to their first dissolution and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> they were afresh chastized by the <hi>LORD,</hi> who notwithstanding most mercifully delivered them again, as soon as they returned themselves to him with all their Hearts.</p>
                  <p>To the History of <hi>Gideon,</hi> we find here also joyned the Tyrannical and Unjust Government of <hi>Abimelek,</hi> who Reigned <hi>3</hi> Years; at the end of which he received his just recompence at the Hand of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Book</hi> also makes mention of <hi>5 Judges,</hi> whose Wars are not set down; to wit, <hi>Thola, Jair, Ebsan, Edon</hi> and <hi>Abdon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This whole <hi>History</hi> may be of use to inform us, <hi>That tho' the</hi> Church of GOD <hi>may fall into divers</hi> Corruptions, <hi>yet he always takes a very particular care, to raise them again from their</hi> Apostacy, <hi>and that he oft makes use of those to punish and chastize his</hi> People, <hi>who have been the occasion of their</hi> Sins; <hi>and that he does not chasten them with a design to destroy them, but to make them return to him by true</hi> Repentance; <hi>and that he is always ready to help and deliver them when they do so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Book</hi> (according to the account of some) contains the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>299,</hi> or <hi>300</hi> years; that is, from the Year since the <hi>Creation</hi> of the <hi>World, 2511,</hi> or <hi>2810.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THus <hi>Joshua</hi> defeated his <hi>Enemies;</hi> the <hi>Heavens</hi> by a miraculous <hi>Solstice,</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to his <hi>Victory;</hi> and thus he proceeded in a continued course of successful Expeditions, as long as any of his <hi>Enemies</hi> were able to make any resistance against his <hi>Victorious Arms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this manner the far greater part of these <hi>Idolatrous Nations</hi> were destroy'd in six years time, the <hi>Scripture</hi> counting no less than one and thirty <hi>Kings,</hi> that were conquer'd by this Couragious <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, some of the ancient <hi>Inhabitants</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to dwell among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to keep them in Breath, that they might not degenerate through <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> as also for a Trial of their Obedience to GOD, who made the Remnant of these <hi>Idolatrous Nations,</hi> the Instruments of his Vengeance against his own <hi>People,</hi> whenever they provoked him to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by their <hi>Sins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After that <hi>Joshua</hi> had thus made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the <hi>Country,</hi> by the wonderful blessing of GOD upon his <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Valour,</hi> he distributed it amongst the <hi>Tribes,</hi> with so much Equity and Justice, as cannot sufficiently be admired: And having atchiev'd all these glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Actions, to which he had been appointed by GOD himself,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2570. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1414.</note> he assembled all the <hi>People</hi> together before his <hi>Death,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> also had done, and repeated to them the great things GOD had done for them, conjuring them in a most pathetical manner, to worship no other GOD, but the LORD alone; and concludes his Discourse with these remarkable Words; <hi>And if it seem evil to you to serve the LORD, chuse this day whom you will serve; whether the Gods which your Fathers served, that were on the other side of the</hi> Flood, <hi>or the Gods of the</hi> Amorites, <hi>in whose Land ye dwell; but as for me and my House, we will serve the</hi> LORD, And soon after died in Peace, being 110 years old, and all the <hi>People</hi> mourned for him.</p>
                     <p>He had the happiness that during the whole time of his <hi>Government</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were not in the least tainted with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> nor transported to any Rebellious <hi>murmurings</hi> against GOD.</p>
                     <p>The many Battels <hi>Joshua</hi> fought against divers <hi>Kings,</hi> to put the <hi>People</hi> of GOD into possession of the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Promise,</hi> gave the <hi>Fathers</hi> occasion to observe, <hi>That we cannot become the Heritage and Portion of the</hi> LORD, <hi>without destroying an</hi> Enemy <hi>we have within us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All of us are born Slaves and Tributaries to the</hi> Canaanites <hi>and</hi> Amorites, <hi>that is, to</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; <hi>and therefore it is of necessity that we be</hi> Regenerated, <hi>to the end that all that belongs to the</hi> Devil <hi>may utterly be destroyed, and rooted out of us before we can become the Kingdom and Inheritance of the</hi> LORD.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> was the first after <hi>Joshua</hi>'s Death, that signaliz'd themselves in exterminating the <hi>Idolaters</hi> that remained yet amongst them; <hi>Caleb,</hi> who was a <hi>Prince</hi> amongst them, being their Leader in these Expeditions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adoni-bezek</hi> was the first that felt the effects of their <hi>Courage;</hi> for having set upon him, they utterly defeated, and took him Prisoner in the pursuit. There was one thing remarkable in the Death of this <hi>Prince, viz.</hi> That the <hi>Israelites</hi> cut off his <hi>Thumbs</hi> and his <hi>great Toes;</hi> by which means he was compelled to confess the equity of the <hi>Divine Vengeance</hi> upon him, who had in like manner treated 70 <hi>Kings,</hi> and in this condition made them gather their Meat under his <hi>Table.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this his publick Acknowledgment of the <hi>Divine Justice,</hi> which as well lays hold on Crowned Heads, as on the meanest Subjects, he was brought to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where he died, leaving a <hi>Memorandum</hi> to all <hi>Kings</hi> (as the <hi>Fathers</hi> observe) how true that word of our <hi>Saviour</hi> is, <hi>That according to the measure we mete out to others, it shall be measured to us again;</hi> and that it is often verified upon <hi>Kings</hi> themselves, as well as their <hi>Subjects;</hi> and if they should chance to escape this Retaliation here in this <hi>Life,</hi> where <hi>Adoni-bezek</hi> justly met with it, they may have reason to fear it will be their Lot in the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>World</hi> to come, where they will not fail of falling into the hands of that <hi>Judge,</hi> who here in this <hi>World</hi> has declared to them, by the Mouth of the wisest of <hi>Kings, That the great and mighty</hi> Men <hi>of the</hi> Earth <hi>shall be mightily tormented, if they abuse the</hi> Power <hi>they are intrusted with, for the glory of</hi> GOD, <hi>and for the good of their</hi> Subjects.</p>

                     <p>During the Government of this Woman, <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> King of <hi>Canaan</hi> declared War against the <hi>Jews,</hi> and sent out an <hi>Army</hi> to fight them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of <hi>Sisera</hi> his General. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi> on this occasion being fill'd with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> gave as great Marks of her Courage in <hi>War,</hi> as she had formerly given of her Prudence in times of <hi>Peace;</hi> and in the first place sent for <hi>Barak,</hi> whom <hi>GOD</hi> had made choice of to Head his <hi>People</hi> against <hi>Sisera;</hi> but <hi>Barak</hi> assured her, that he would never charge himself with that Command, except she would march along with him.</p>
                     <p>As soon as the Day of the <hi>Battel</hi> was come, and that <hi>Deborah</hi> had commanded <hi>Barak</hi> to set upon <hi>Sisera</hi> with an Army of 10000 Men, <hi>GOD</hi> struck the Hearts of their <hi>Enemies</hi> with a Panick Fear, and general consternation, insomuch as <hi>Sisera</hi> himself, smit with the same <hi>Terror,</hi> was forc'd to flee away on foot, whilst the <hi>Israelites</hi> discomfited, and cut to pieces all his <hi>Army.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As <hi>Sisera</hi> was thus endeavouring to save himself by Flight, <hi>Jael</hi> the Wife of <hi>Heber,</hi> seeing him draw near to her <hi>Tent,</hi> went out to meet him, and desir'd him to come and rest himself with her; which Invitation he gladly accepted of, and having drunk a draught of <hi>Milk,</hi> laid himself down to sleep, <hi>Jael</hi> perceiving him fast asleep, took a <hi>Nail,</hi> and struck it with a <hi>Hammer</hi> into his <hi>Temples,</hi> fastning his <hi>Head</hi> to the ground: And as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak</hi> was in pursuit of him, <hi>Jael</hi> desired him to enter into her <hi>Tent,</hi> where she shew'd him <hi>Sisera</hi> lying dead upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Deborah</hi> after the Fight sang a Hymn of <hi>Praises</hi> to <hi>GOD,</hi> for the glorious <hi>Victory</hi> vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to his <hi>People,</hi> wherein she highly extols and commends the Wisdom and Courage of <hi>Jael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus as one</hi> Woman <hi>began this</hi> War, <hi>so another finished it; and both of them were il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious instances, that</hi> GOD <hi>can bestow upon</hi> Women <hi>themselves (whensoever it pleases him,) as well as upon</hi> Men, <hi>the Courage and Conduct necessary for the Atchievement of the greatest Enterprizes. For we see</hi> Deborah <hi>here keeping that</hi> People <hi>in Obedience and full Subjection, whose</hi> murmurs <hi>even</hi> Moses <hi>himself (that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Man of</hi> GOD) <hi>could not appease; she had the honour of being the first Soveraign</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness <hi>that ever</hi> GOD <hi>set over his</hi> People; <hi>during whose Administration they wanted none of the Advantages they might have expected under the Conduct of the greatest</hi> Heroes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>She appointed</hi> Generals <hi>her self, determin'd the Numbers of their</hi> Forces, <hi>appointed Quarters for the</hi> Army, <hi>fix'd the Day of</hi> Combat, <hi>and sent forth</hi> Barak, <hi>not so much to a</hi> Fight, <hi>as to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> Victory. <hi>And this</hi> General, <hi>who lookt upon this holy Widow as the</hi> Angel <hi>of the LORD, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded himself, that the happy Success of his</hi> Arms <hi>did depend upon her Presence, and therefore would not stir a foot without her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fathers</hi> in their Reflections on these great Examples, observe, <hi>that there is nothing truly great upon the</hi> Earth, <hi>but what is founded on the</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> GOD: <hi>That the most Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> Men, <hi>become weak as</hi> Women, <hi>when left to themselves; and</hi> Women <hi>more magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous than</hi> Men, <hi>when they are full of</hi> GOD; <hi>and that then that word of S.</hi> Paul <hi>is verified, that</hi> GOD <hi>oft chooses the foolish things of the World to confound the Wise, the Weak to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Strong, and the things that are not, to confound those that are, that no</hi> Flesh <hi>may</hi> glory <hi>before the</hi> LORD; <hi>who alone is, and there is none besides him; and to whom alone the glory of all that is Good or Great in the</hi> Creatures <hi>doth belong.</hi>

                     <p>

                           <hi>Gideon</hi> obtains of GOD the Miracle of the <hi>Fleece,</hi> for a sign that he had chosen him to be the Deliverer and Avenger of his <hi>People.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen <hi>Gideon</hi> knew that <hi>GOD</hi> would make use of him, to be the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his People, by the Fire that came forth from the <hi>Rock,</hi> and consum'd his <hi>Offering,</hi> he began to cast about, how he might best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the Deliverance of <hi>Israel,</hi> from the Tyranny under which they groan'd. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being inform'd that the <hi>Midianites, Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites,</hi> and other <hi>neighbouring Nations,</hi> were gathered together against <hi>Israel,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> came upon him, and sounding the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, Abiezer</hi> was gathered after him: He sent <hi>Messengers</hi> also throughout <hi>Manasseh, Ashur, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulon</hi> and <hi>Nephthali,</hi> and they came up to joyn with him: And thus without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, he who was but a private <hi>Person,</hi> and of a mean <hi>Family</hi> too, saw himself <hi>Commander</hi> in chief of a great <hi>Army,</hi> being obeyed and respected by all as their <hi>Prince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Gideon</hi> perceiving himself arriv'd to this high degree of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> was not thereby puft up in the least; but remembring that he held that Station, only from and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>GOD,</hi> he rather appeared so much the more humble; and the distrust he had of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self encreased even to excess; for not being satisfied with the first <hi>Miracle GOD</hi> had wrought in favour of him, or the <hi>Courage</hi> wherewith he found himself extraordinarily inspired, and fitted for the great <hi>Undertakings</hi> to which <hi>GOD</hi> had called him, he suspended the execution of his Designs, till GOD had given him fresh repeated Assurances of the Choice he had made of him, to command and deliver his People.</p>
                     <p>In which thing, as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> observes, he did not act more for his own satisfaction, than he did for our Instruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to teach us this important Lesson, <hi>That we must not too easily suffer our selves to be perswaded, that GOD has called us to far more holy Employments, than were those which</hi> Gideon <hi>was called to at that time.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Gideon</hi> then earnestly begs of GOD, to give him a fresh assurance of his <hi>Divine Call,</hi> to be the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Redeemer</hi> of his <hi>People,</hi> saying to the LORD, <hi>Behold I will put a Fleece of</hi> Wool <hi>in the</hi> Floor, <hi>and if the</hi> Dew <hi>be on the Fleece only, and it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be dry on all the</hi> Earth, <hi>then shall I know that thou wilt save</hi> Israel <hi>by my Hand, as thou hast said; and it was so: for when he arose in the Morning, he wringed out of his</hi> Fleece <hi>a Bowl full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> But his humble Fear and distrust be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet dissipated, he besought <hi>GOD</hi> once more (and said, <hi>Let me prove, I pray thee but this once with the</hi> Fleece; <hi>Let it now be dry only upon the</hi> Fleece, <hi>and upon all the Ground let there be</hi> Dew, <hi>GOD</hi> also performed according to his Desire, and by both these <hi>Miracles</hi> left him no shadow for a Doubt, but that he was indeed appointed by <hi>GOD</hi> to deliver <hi>Israel</hi> from their <hi>Enemies.</hi>

                        <hi>Whereas now by means of a contrary</hi> Miracle, <hi>the</hi> Church of GOD, <hi>scatter'd over the Face of the whole</hi> Earth, <hi>hath in abundance received the</hi> Heavenly Dew, <hi>wherewith</hi> GOD <hi>hath wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it, whilst the</hi> Land <hi>of</hi> Judea <hi>is all dry and parched, and whilst her unthankfulness for the many Benefits</hi> GOD <hi>had bestowed upon her, (which only serv'd to make her proud and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, instead of humbling her) has made her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to partake of the Mercy of</hi> Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moreover these</hi> Miracles <hi>teach us; That the</hi> Grace <hi>of</hi> GOD <hi>is a kind of</hi> Heavenly Dew, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the continual supply of which our</hi> Souls <hi>are in the same condition, in which we see a dry and barren Ground is, that is parched with the scorching heat of the</hi> Sun, <hi>and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the</hi> Rain <hi>and</hi> Dew of Heaven, <hi>and by this means is condemn'd to an eternal sterility and unfruitfulness.

And having in a short time raised a great <hi>Army,</hi> consisting of 32000, he encamped himself near the <hi>Midianites,</hi> besides the Well of <hi>Harad,</hi> and on the South of them.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>GOD</hi> seeing the great Numbers of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and foreseeing that this ungrateful and presumptuous <hi>People</hi> would be apt to attribute the <hi>Victory,</hi> which depended only on his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Assistance, to the multitude and strength of their <hi>Forces:</hi> He told <hi>Gideon,</hi> that in case he did march with all those For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against the Host of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> he would miss of the <hi>Victory,</hi> because he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to leave them the least ground to say or think, that they had overcome the <hi>Midianites</hi> by their own strength.</p>

                     <p>Of the former sort, there were but 300 in all, which <hi>GOD</hi> commanded him to lead on boldly against the <hi>Midianites,</hi> for that with them only he should obtain the Victory, <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> fully relying on the Word of <hi>GOD,</hi> sent home the rest of the <hi>People,</hi> keeping none with him besides the 300 <hi>Men,</hi> that had Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>Water</hi> out of the hollow of their hands, and with them couragiously advanced against the <hi>Enemy.</hi>

                        <hi>Gideon</hi> having heard this <hi>Dream,</hi> and the Interpretation, he return'd full of Courage and Assurance into the Host of <hi>Israel,</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to arise, and get ready, for that <hi>GOD</hi> had deliver'd the <hi>Midianites</hi> into their Hand.

                     <p>As soon as they were come to the out-side of the <hi>Camp,</hi> and the Signal was given by <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi> they all at once sounded their <hi>Trumpets,</hi> brake their <hi>Pitchers,</hi> and shewed the <hi>Lamps</hi> that were hid in them, crying with a loud Voice, <hi>The Sword of the</hi> LORD <hi>and of</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon; whereupon the whole <hi>Camp</hi> of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites</hi> being seiz'd with horror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ran away and fled, and by a miraculous effect of the <hi>Divine Power,</hi> turn'd their <hi>Swords</hi> against one another.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Samson</hi> not at all satisfied with this Excuse, protested, that now they might thank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if they came to feel the effects of his <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Anger,</hi> for this their unjust dealing with him.</p>
                     <p>In this Resolution he went and caught 300 <hi>Foxes,</hi> and tying them Tail to Tail, and fastning a <hi>Firebrand</hi> or <hi>Torch</hi> between their <hi>Tails,</hi> he let them go into the <hi>standing Corn</hi> of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and reduc'd it to Ashes, with their <hi>Vineyards</hi> and <hi>Olive-Trees.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Philistins</hi> being strangely alarm'd with this loss, were very inquisitive to know the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it; and being inform'd that it was <hi>Samson,</hi> and what had provok'd him to do so, instead of endeavouring to avenge themselves of him, they turn'd all their <hi>Rage</hi> against his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Father-in-Law,</hi> and burnt them with <hi>Fire.</hi> But <hi>Samson</hi> not thinking himself sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aveng'd of them, took his opportunity (not long after) to set upon them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droy'd them with a very great Slaughter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Philistins</hi> at length rouzed by these repeated Violences of <hi>Samson,</hi> gather'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great Numbers, and encamped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Lot of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> who being terrified with this approach of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listins,</hi> demanded of them why they were come to invade their <hi>Country?</hi> And the <hi>Philistins</hi> having answer'd, that they were come to seize <hi>Samson:</hi> The Men of <hi>Judah</hi> to rid themselves of these unwelcom <hi>Guests,</hi> promised to deliver <hi>Samson</hi> into their hands; and as they soon after brought him down to them bound with two new <hi>Cords,</hi> and the <hi>Philistins</hi> began to shout for joy, as now thinking themselves Masters of him, who had done them so much mischief; the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the LORD coming mightily upon him, the <hi>Cords</hi> that were on his Arms became as <hi>Flax</hi> that is burnt with <hi>Fire,</hi> and his <hi>Bands</hi> loosed from off his <hi>Hands,</hi> and taking up the <hi>Jaw-bone</hi> of an <hi>Ass,</hi> he slew therewith a thousand of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and said, <hi>With the</hi> Jaw-bone <hi>of an</hi> Ass, <hi>heaps upon heaps, have I slain a thousand Men: and when he had made an end of speaking, he cast away the</hi> Jaw-bone, <hi>and called the place</hi> Ramath-Lehi.</p>
                     <p>The Heat and Violence wherewith he was carried forth to do this Action, had caus'd an extreme <hi>Thirst</hi> in him, which made him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly cry to the <hi>LORD</hi> for Relief in this his extreme need. <hi>GOD</hi> immediately heard his <hi>Prayer,</hi> and opening an hallow-place in the <hi>Jaw-bone,</hi> by his Power, made a Spring of <hi>Water</hi> to proceed from it, wherewith (when <hi>Samson</hi> had quench'd his Thirst) his <hi>Strength</hi> return'd, and he revived: and he called the Name of the place <hi>Enhakker.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>SAMSON</hi> having in so miraculous a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner slain a thousand <hi>Philistins,</hi> one would think that so astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Instance of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power</hi> assisting him,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2880. <hi>before</hi> Christ 1124.</note> should stop the course of their Malice, and hinder them (in love to themselves) from attempting ought against him for the time to come. But we must consider, that their Warring against <hi>Samson,</hi> was a representation of the <hi>Devils</hi> future Wars and Fightings against <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Holy Church;</hi> and therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually renewed Persecutions of the <hi>Philistins</hi> against <hi>Samson,</hi> do very fitly represent to us, the obstinacy wherewith the <hi>Devils</hi> make War against the <hi>Faithful,</hi> and that unalterable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice wherewith they persecute them, without being discourag'd by the many foils and falls they receive from the <hi>Saints,</hi> by means of the Power of GOD, that is engag'd for them, and manifest it self in them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Philistins</hi> therefore, instead of letting <hi>Samson</hi> alone, upon Motives taken from their own Interest (as in all prudence they ought to have done) did on the contrary mind no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than how they might best lay new Snares for him, and get him into their hands. And as they were very diligent and attentive in this enquiry, and had their <hi>Spies</hi> out conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, to observe his haunts, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by some of them that he was got into the City <hi>Gaza;</hi> whereupon (without losing time) being egg'd on by their extream hatred and thirst for <hi>Revenge,</hi> they assembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by Night, and compassed the <hi>City,</hi> resolving in the Morning to set upon him and kill him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Samson</hi> having notice of their design, seem'd to take little notice of it, and having slept till Midnight with an <hi>Harlot</hi> which he met with, he arose, and without fear went to the Gates of the <hi>City,</hi> plucking up the <hi>Doors,</hi> and two <hi>Side-posts</hi> of it, and laying them upon his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> carried them to the top of a <hi>Mountain,</hi> that is before <hi>Hebron,</hi> passing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernedly by, through the midst of those who were laid in Ambush to seize and destroy him, who being amazed and daunted with seeing those prodigious effects of his <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> let him pass unmolested.</p>
                     <p>Thus were the Hopes the <hi>Philistins</hi> had conceiv'd (to surprize <hi>Samson</hi> once more) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and they found (as formerly) that all their Designs and Projects to destroy him, tho' never so wisely laid, and warily conducted, did at length turn to their own confusion and overthrow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> Figure (saith S. <hi>Gregory) is so plain and sensible, that it cannot but be acknowledg'd, to be unexcellent Emblem of our Saviour</hi> Jesus Christ. <hi>He it was whom his</hi> Enemies <hi>having persecuted all his life long, they at last lodg'd him in a</hi> Sepulchre, <hi>seal'd him up there, and surrounded his</hi> Grave <hi>with their Guards; as the</hi> Philistins <hi>encompassed the City</hi> Gaza, <hi>whilst</hi> Samson <hi>was peaceably taking his Rest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But this true and glorious</hi> Samson, <hi>awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and arising at Midnight by his glorious</hi> Resurrection, <hi>and delivering himself from the place, where his</hi> Enemies <hi>kept him shut up, not only came forth from thence himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ever after subject to the Laws and Power of</hi> Death; <hi>but at the same time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed all</hi> Mankind <hi>from that formidable</hi> Enemy, <hi>by destroying</hi> Death <hi>it self, whose</hi> Gates <hi>and</hi> Bars <hi>he has for ever broke and pluckt up, (as the</hi> Scripture <hi>mentions) and has carried them with him to the top of the</hi> Mountain, <hi>that is, to</hi> Heaven, <hi>which the</hi> Resurrection <hi>of our</hi> Blessed Saviour <hi>has open'd to</hi> Mankind, <hi>and whither his</hi> Members <hi>hope to follow him, according to his own faithful</hi> Promise, <hi>that</hi> where he is, they should be also, <hi>to see and eternally enjoy that</hi> Glory, <hi>which he had with the</hi> Father <hi>before the</hi> World <hi>was.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For this reason it is, that all true</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>may cry out boastingly with S.</hi> Paul, O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? The Sting of Death is Sin, and the strength of Sin is the Law; but thanks be to GOD, who giveth us the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry through Jesus Christ our LORD.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Samson</hi> discovers to <hi>Delilah</hi> that his Strength lay in his <hi>Hair,</hi> which she cutting off he is seiz'd.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT had been well for <hi>Samson,</hi> if he had been as strong and powerful to resist the Charms of a <hi>Woman,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2885. <hi>before</hi> Christ 1119.</note> as he was in tearing of <hi>Lions,</hi> and encountring whole <hi>Armies</hi> alone. But alas! the Enticements of <hi>Delilah</hi> prov'd too strong for him, who was the strongest of all <hi>Men;</hi> and in her Embraces he met with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster, he had so happily escaped in the most dangerous and threatning Encounters.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Philistins</hi> having observ'd, that <hi>Samson</hi> resorted often to <hi>Delilah,</hi> promised her a great Sum of <hi>Money,</hi> if she could get out of him, wherein his <hi>Strength</hi> lay. <hi>Samson</hi> at first (upon her enquiry) plaid upon her, as not thinking it needful, to tell her a Truth might prove so fatal to him: He told her, that for to level his <hi>Strength</hi> with those of other <hi>Men,</hi> they needed only to bind him with <hi>New Cords</hi> that had never been used, or to fasten his <hi>Locks</hi> to a <hi>Web;</hi> but <hi>Delilah</hi> soon found, that these were only delusory put-offs, to make her give over her Importunity: Wherefore being gaul'd with <hi>Samson</hi>'s mocking of her, she set all her Artifices at work, and by continual urging and pressing of him, made him at last discover the truth to her; he told her, that from his, Birth no <hi>Razor</hi> had ever touch'd his <hi>Head;</hi> and that if he were <hi>shaven,</hi> his <hi>strength</hi> would leave him, and he become like another Man.</p>
                     <p>No sooner had <hi>Delilah</hi> got this Secret out of him, but she sent for the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listins,</hi> and having made him sleep on her <hi>Knees,</hi> she caused 7 <hi>Locks</hi> of his Head to be cut off. <hi>Samson</hi> soon after being awaked with the cry of <hi>Delilah,</hi> that the <hi>Philistins</hi> were upon him, he thought to go out as at other times, for he knew not that the <hi>LORD</hi> was departed from him. So the <hi>Philistins</hi> took him, and brought him down to <hi>Gaza,</hi> bound him with Fetters of <hi>Brass,</hi> put out his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and made him grind in the <hi>Prison-House.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilst <hi>Samson</hi> was thus wretchedly employ'd by his <hi>Enemies</hi> in this hard and shameful labour, the <hi>Hair</hi> of his Head began to grow again: And the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Philistins</hi> gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves together, for to offer a great and solemn <hi>Sacrifice</hi> unto <hi>Dagon</hi> their <hi>God,</hi> for having delivered <hi>Samson</hi> their Enemy and destroyer of their <hi>Country</hi> into their hand; and when they were mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2887.</note> they sent for <hi>Samson</hi> to make them <hi>Sport,</hi> placing him between the <hi>Pillars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Samson</hi> touch'd to the Heart, at this their insolent treating of him, desired the <hi>Lad</hi> (that held him by the hand) to lead him to the <hi>Pillars</hi> on which the House stood, that he might rest himself against them. And as soon as he was come to the place, he prayed unto the <hi>LORD GOD,</hi> to give him Strength only this time, that he might be at once aveng'd of the <hi>Philistins</hi> for his two <hi>Eyes;</hi> and laying hold of the <hi>Pillars</hi> with both his hands, and shaking them with all his might, the <hi>House</hi> fell, crushing him and all the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> with about 3000 more of them that were therein, and on the <hi>Roof</hi> of the said <hi>House;</hi> so that he slew (as the <hi>Scripture</hi> observes) more at his death, than he had done in all his life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> History (as the <hi>Fathers</hi> tell us) <hi>is a lively representation of the effects of the</hi> Death <hi>of our</hi> Saviour, <hi>who by his voluntary Death confounded the</hi> Devils <hi>more, than they had been during all his Life-time: For then it was that the</hi> Devils-House <hi>was cast down to the ground, and that the Arrogance of those proud</hi> Angels <hi>was laid low.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the</hi> Fathers <hi>do not content themselves only in considering the Mysteries in this</hi> History, <hi>that have manifest reference to</hi> Jesus Christ; <hi>but they deplore also the unhappy chance, whereby this invincible Strong one was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd and overcome of a</hi> Woman; <hi>he loses all his</hi> Locks, <hi>that is, his</hi> Vertues; <hi>they put out his</hi> Eyes, <hi>that is, they rob him of his</hi> Light <hi>and</hi> Understanding, <hi>and condemn him to work in the</hi> Mill, <hi>that is, abandon him like a</hi> Beast <hi>to the vain Pleasures of this</hi> World, <hi>where a Man meets with nothing but Trouble and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and where he continues fetter'd in the Chains of his own</hi> Will <hi>and</hi> Lusts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A</hi> Sinner <hi>in this condition has no other way left, but to call upon GOD, that his</hi> Locks <hi>may grow again, that is, that he may recover his lost</hi> Graces. <hi>'Tis</hi> Repentance <hi>that recovers the</hi> Souls <hi>strength, and pulls down the</hi> Pillars <hi>of the</hi> Devils House, <hi>and overthrows and crushes the</hi> Enemies, <hi>that triumph over her, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the</hi> Soul <hi>victorious by her own ruin, making her die to her self, that she might live to GOD; and lose her self, that she might find him who is the only satisfying Object and Sovereign Good of rational and intelligent</hi> Creatures.</p>

                     <p>As soon as he was come to his <hi>Father-in-Laws House,</hi> he received him with much Joy and Kindness, forcing him to continue with him three Days; and then being very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with him, he both by his kind En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and pressing Invitation, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to oblige him to stay longer with him than he intended; so that it was the fifth Day towards Evening, before he could get away from his <hi>Fathers;</hi> and having reach'd <hi>Gibeah</hi> a while after <hi>Sun-set,</hi> he was fain (with his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi>) to sit down in the <hi>Street,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was none so kind as to offer them a Lodging; but soon after an <hi>Old Man</hi> coming from his <hi>Work</hi> out of the Field, seeing him stand in the <hi>Street,</hi> kindly invited him with his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> to his House, giving them an hearty Entertainment.</p>

                     <p>But before they came to open force, they sent some <hi>Deputies</hi> to the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand those wicked Wretches that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this inhuman Outrage, that by putting them to death they might turn away the wrath of <hi>GOD</hi> from <hi>Israel;</hi> but the <hi>Benjamites</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of hearkning to these just and equal Proposals) declar'd, they would protect and secure them; and assembled themselves to fight the <hi>Israelites,</hi> to the Number of 26000 <hi>Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Israelites</hi> having ask'd Counsel of the <hi>LORD,</hi> the <hi>LORD</hi> approv'd of their going against the <hi>Benjamites;</hi> whereupon they went forth to fight them; but notwithstanding the good success they had promised themselves from the justness of their Cause, they lost that Day 22000 <hi>Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They were strangly surpriz'd at this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Defeat, but yet resolv'd to try a second <hi>Battel,</hi> for which they prepared themselves by a deep Humiliation before <hi>GOD,</hi> and asking Counsel of him, who again bade them go up against their <hi>Brethren,</hi> and yet for all this the Success was not answerable, for the <hi>Benjamites</hi> destroy'd 18000 more of them.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Israel</hi> being astonish'd to see 40000 <hi>Men</hi> destroy'd by 26000, and that too in so just a Cause, betook themselves to <hi>GOD,</hi> by <hi>Fasting, Weeping,</hi> and offering <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> and having ask'd Counsel of the LORD the third time, he not only bade them to go up against the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> but also assur'd them of the Victory.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Israelites</hi> encourag'd with this Divine Assurance, they march'd towards <hi>Gibeah,</hi> having appointed a great Party to lie in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush near the City.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Benjamites</hi> (like Men drunk with their two late Victories) made a furious Sally out of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> which was increased by the feign'd Flight of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> to draw them from the <hi>City;</hi> but soon after those that lay in Ambush near <hi>Gibeah,</hi> having set it on Fire, the <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> saw they were lost, being on all sides encompast by the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who kill'd 25000 of their <hi>Men,</hi> and burnt their <hi>Cities;</hi> only 600 of the <hi>Benjamites</hi> saved themselves by retiring and hiding themselves in the Rock of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> who were the means afterwards of recovering that <hi>Tribe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Israelites</hi> after this Victory found themselves extreamly afflicted, for the loss of one of the 12 <hi>Tribes;</hi> and having sworn, that none of them would give their <hi>Daughters</hi> to the <hi>Benjamites</hi> for <hi>Wives,</hi> they went and slew all the Males and Women of <hi>Jabesh Gilead,</hi> because they were not come up with them to fight against the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> and only saved 400 of their <hi>Virgin Daughters</hi> alive, and gave them to the <hi>Benjamites</hi> for <hi>Wives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Fathers <hi>have admired the depths of</hi> GOD<hi>'s</hi> Judgments <hi>in this</hi> History. <hi>Never was there a War more holily undertaken, than this of the</hi> Israelites, <hi>and yet they were twice beaten with great loss.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>GOD <hi>was willing by this</hi> (Figure) <hi>to teach us, how pure they ought to be, who undertake to punish other mens Faults. It is a false</hi> Zeal <hi>that puts Men upon purifying others, without being first clean themselves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moreover,</hi> GOD <hi>would inform us by this great</hi> Example, <hi>how great our</hi> Charity <hi>ought to be towards our</hi> Brethren. <hi>How detestable and flagitious soever the</hi> Benjamites <hi>might be, yet</hi> GOD <hi>will have the</hi> Israelites <hi>to bewail the sad necessity, that engageth them to destroy their own</hi> Brethren.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus we see that all</hi> Israel <hi>were touch'd with inward</hi> Sorrow, <hi>for having exterminated them, and now wholly employ'd their Thoughts, how best to recover and restore those, who so lately they had endeavour'd utterly to destroy.</hi>

                        <hi>It is a shame</hi> (say the <hi>Fathers) for</hi> Christians <hi>in this point to give way to the</hi> Jews, <hi>and not to be highly concern'd, not only when they see a Country or a Family lost from the</hi> Church; <hi>but even when they see so much as one single</hi> Soul <hi>cut off from their</hi> Society <hi>and</hi> Body; <hi>forasmuch as they ought to be as sensible of this loss, as they would be of cutting off one of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi> For (as <hi>S.</hi> Paul <hi>sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ruth,</hi> in obedience to her <hi>Mother-in-Laws</hi> Command, performed what of her self she would have been very backward to; and being favour'd by the darkness of the <hi>Night,</hi> came unperceiv'd of any, and laid her self down at <hi>Boaz</hi> his feet; who awakening at <hi>Midnight,</hi> was affrighted to find a <hi>Woman</hi> lying at his Feet, and demanded who she was. <hi>Ruth</hi> having disclos'd her self, represented to him, that he was a near <hi>Kinsman,</hi> who (according to the order of the <hi>Law</hi>) had a right to marry her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Boaz,</hi> who was then above 100 years of Age, exprest the esteem he had for her, in that she did not imitate the <hi>Behaviour</hi> of the <hi>Daughters</hi> of his Age, who (for the most part) followed the transports of a blind <hi>Love,</hi> and inconsiderately preferr'd young <hi>Men</hi> before wise and staid <hi>Husbands;</hi> but added, that before he could lawfully marry her, another <hi>Kinsman</hi> (that was nearer than he) was first to declare himself, whether he were willing to perform the duty of a <hi>Kinsman</hi> towards her or not.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly the next day <hi>Boaz</hi> went to the Gate of the <hi>City,</hi> and being sat down with the <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> who met there to do Justice to the <hi>People,</hi> he saw the <hi>Kinsman</hi> he had spoke of to <hi>Ruth,</hi> passing by; and having call'd to him, told in presence of 10 of the <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> that <hi>Naomi</hi> did intend to sell a parcel of her <hi>Husbands Land,</hi> of which he thought good to acquaint him; for, that in case of his Refusal, he would buy it himself: The <hi>Kinsman</hi> having answer'd, that he was willing to buy it; <hi>Boaz</hi> replied, that at the same time he bought the <hi>Land,</hi> he must also marry <hi>Ruth.</hi> But the <hi>Kinsman</hi> disliking this Proposal, past over his right to <hi>Boaz,</hi> who at the same time took the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of his <hi>City,</hi> to witness of his purchasing the Estate of <hi>Elimelech,</hi> and taking <hi>Ruth</hi> to be his <hi>Wife;</hi> who wished him all manner of Prosperity and Happiness with her, that she might be like <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> who built up the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> and that he might be famous in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi> throughout all Ages.</p>
                     <p>Thus was this <hi>Marriage</hi> consummated, which <hi>GOD</hi> soon after blessed with the Birth of <hi>Obed,</hi> who was the Father of <hi>Jesse,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> Grandfather; upon which occasion all her Friends and Neighbours came to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate <hi>Naomi,</hi> upon this happy Fruit of her <hi>Daughters Marriage;</hi> assuring her, that she was more happy in such a <hi>Daughter,</hi> than if she had seven <hi>Sons.

The <hi>Philistins</hi> carry the <hi>Ark</hi> into the <hi>Temple</hi> of their Idol <hi>Dagon,</hi> which falls down, and is shatter'd to pieces before it; and the <hi>Philistins</hi> are grievously plagu'd by <hi>GOD;</hi> whereupon they send back the <hi>Ark</hi> with Presents, which comes to <hi>Bethshemesh</hi> in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> and from thence is brought to <hi>Kiriath-jearim;</hi> where <hi>Samuel</hi> begins a notable Reformation of the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and assembles the <hi>Israelites</hi> at <hi>Mizpeh;</hi> the <hi>Philistins</hi> designing to surprize them there, <hi>GOD</hi> strikes a Terror into them by great and dreadful <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclaps,</hi> whereupon they are easily defeated by the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Samuel,</hi> being by him in his old <hi>Age</hi> appointed to judge the <hi>People,</hi> do not follow their <hi>Fathers steps,</hi> wherefore the <hi>Israelites</hi> demand a <hi>King,</hi> which displeaseth GOD, who commands <hi>Samuel</hi> to represent to them, how their <hi>King</hi> would treat them; but the <hi>People</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding continuing obstinate in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Prophet</hi> agree to it, and <hi>Samuel</hi> tells <hi>Saul</hi> (who was come to him at <hi>Mizpeh</hi>) that he was to Reign over <hi>Israel,</hi> and anoints him <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul,</hi> in the beginning of his Reign, beats the <hi>Ammonites; Samuel</hi> lays down his Authority he formerly had over the <hi>People</hi> as their <hi>Judge,</hi> having first given an honourable testimony of his Innocence and Integrity in that <hi>station. Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> his <hi>Son</hi> make <hi>War</hi> against the <hi>Philistins</hi> and others, and defeat them. <hi>Samuel</hi> declares to <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>GOD</hi> would take the <hi>Crown</hi> from him, and anoint <hi>David</hi> King, who fights with <hi>Goliah</hi> the <hi>Giant,</hi> and kills him. <hi>Saul</hi> being jealous of the Honours done to <hi>David</hi> for this Victory, seeks to kill him, who leaving the <hi>Court,</hi> comes to <hi>Samuel</hi> at <hi>Naioth,</hi> and contracts a strict and firm League of Friendship with <hi>Jonathan;</hi> he flees to <hi>Achish,</hi> King of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> where (to save his life) he counterfeits himself Mad, and retires from thence to <hi>Adullam,</hi> where his Friends and others joyn with him, who is fain to stray up and down to escape <hi>Sauls</hi> pursuit. <hi>Saul</hi> murthers <hi>Ahimelech,</hi> and all his House, with <hi>85 Priests,</hi> and all the Inhabitants of the City <hi>Nob,</hi> only for having innocently entertain'd <hi>David,</hi> and furnish'd him with <hi>Bread. David</hi> hides himself in the <hi>Wilderness</hi> of <hi>Ziph,</hi> and from thence retires to that of <hi>Maon,</hi> whither <hi>Saul</hi> pursues him, till News is brought him, that the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listins</hi> were entred the <hi>Land,</hi> and having beaten them, he continues to pursue <hi>David;</hi> but at last acknowledging his fault, he prays <hi>David</hi> to spare his <hi>Family,</hi> when he should come to the <hi>Crown.</hi> After this, we have a relation of the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and what past between <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Abigail,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Nabal;</hi> and how <hi>Saul,</hi> beginning afresh to persecute <hi>David,</hi> he flees to <hi>Achish</hi> King of <hi>Gath,</hi> who gives him the Town of <hi>Ziklag</hi> to dwell in; from whence he makes excursions upon the Neighbouring <hi>People,</hi> killing many, and getting great Spoil. After this, the <hi>Philistins</hi> coming with a great force against <hi>Israel, Saul</hi> asks Counsel of the <hi>LORD,</hi> who does not vouchsafe to answer him; whereupon he addresses himself to the <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor. David</hi> making ready to joyn the <hi>Forces</hi> he had, with those of <hi>Achish,</hi> against <hi>Saul,</hi> is countermanded. In his absence <hi>Ziklag</hi> is spoiled by the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> but setting upon them, he recovers all the <hi>Spoil</hi> and <hi>Captives</hi> they had taken. And lastly, this <hi>Book</hi> concludes with the tragical Death of <hi>Saul</hi> and his <hi>Sons.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>SAMUEL</hi> being to appear one day in the <hi>World</hi> with the lustre of a great and holy <hi>Prophet,</hi> GOD disposed him thereto from his tender In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The first year of</hi> Eli<hi>'s Government, at the same time that the Angel fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the birth of</hi> Samson, Anno Mundi 2848. <hi>and before Christ</hi> 1156.</note> 
                        <hi>Hannah</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was more glorious in having such a <hi>Son,</hi> than if she had been Mother of the greatest <hi>Prince</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> after she had been a long time barren, was instant in <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to GOD, till at last she obtain'd this <hi>Child,</hi> which was the fruit of her <hi>Prayers,</hi> and the reward of her <hi>Faith.</hi> And this <hi>Holy Mother</hi> knowing that her <hi>Child</hi> was the <hi>Gift of</hi> GOD, made no difficulty to return him to the <hi>Donor.</hi> She did not content her self to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem him with <hi>Money,</hi> or to offer him up for some years only; but she consecrated him to the LORD all his Life-time. She had no sooner weaned him, but her gratitude to GOD pressed her, to dedicate him to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, from whom she had received him; and by a strange disengagement from all human Considerations, she in opposition to her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tenderness for her only and long lookt for <hi>Son,</hi> and to all appearance of Reason, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated him to GOD in his first Infancy, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering him into the hands of <hi>Eli,</hi> when he was but about 3 years of Age, no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering him as her own, but GOD's, to whom she had given him.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Hannahs Sacrifice</hi> did in some sort resemble that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> because in parting with her <hi>Son</hi> to GOD, she believ'd she did nothing else, but render to <hi>GOD</hi> what was his own, and what she could not (without a kind of <hi>Sacriledge</hi>) withhold from him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GOD</hi> rewarded this Devotion of the <hi>Mother</hi> in the abundant effusion of his Graces upon her <hi>Son.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2861.</note> And when in the 12<hi>th</hi> year of his Age he was employed in the Service of <hi>Eli</hi> the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the <hi>Temple,</hi> where he lay also by Night, not far from the <hi>Ark,</hi> GOD favour'd him with a <hi>Revelation;</hi> from which it might be judg'd, how great a <hi>Prophet</hi> he was like to be, when arrived at his Manhood, to whom <hi>GOD</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested himself so remarkably in his early <hi>Childhood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>GOD called to him thrice, as he was laid down to sleep; but <hi>Samuel</hi> supposing it to be the Voice of <hi>Eli</hi> the <hi>High Priest,</hi> arose each time and went to <hi>Eli,</hi> to know what his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was; but the fourth time <hi>Eli</hi> having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd <hi>Samuel,</hi> that it was the LORD that called him, <hi>GOD</hi> spake to him, and foretold the terrible disasters that were to fall on <hi>Eli</hi> and all his <hi>House;</hi> he told him, he could no longer endure the unhappy negligence of that too indulgent <hi>Father,</hi> who knowing the disorders and crimes his <hi>Sons</hi> committed, and seeing in how many several ways they prophaned the <hi>Sacredness</hi> of his <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> contented himself with giving them a slight Reproof, instead of being animated against them with an holy <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Glory of <hi>GOD;</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declar'd unto him, that such were the enormous Crimes of that Family, that they should never be expiated by all the <hi>Sacrifices Eli</hi> did, or could offer.</p>
                     <p>The next Morning <hi>Eli</hi> was very urgent with little <hi>Samuel,</hi> to know of him what the <hi>LORD</hi> had said unto him; which tho' he was very loath to do, out of the great respect he had for him, yet upon his solemn conjuring of him, he told him all. <hi>Eli</hi> acknowledging at last the justice of the Sentence past against him and his <hi>Family,</hi> found too late, that it is not sufficient for a <hi>Father</hi> to be good him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if he does not use his utmost endeavours to make his <hi>Children</hi> so likewise, and with a most humble submission, disposed himself to undergo the <hi>Punishment</hi> he had deserved by the too indulgent Education of his <hi>Children.</hi>

                     <head>The Punishment of Eli.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>GOD, in order to punish <hi>Eli</hi> the <hi>High Priest</hi> for his negligence in Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Disorders of his <hi>Children,</hi> suffers him (upon hearing the News of their being slain, and the taking of the <hi>Ark</hi>) to fall down from his Seat, and break his Neck.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>GOD being about to fulfil the <hi>Judgments</hi> he had denounc'd against the House of <hi>Eli,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2888. <hi>before</hi> Christ 1116.</note> he stirr'd up a New War against the <hi>Jews,</hi> from their Neighbours the <hi>Philistins.</hi> This Nation were the open and profest <hi>Enemies</hi> of the People of GOD, and was made use of by him, as a powerful Instrument of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Vengeance, to punish the <hi>Jews</hi> for their Crimes and Disobedience against him.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly at this time the LORD being highly provok'd (by the Apostacy and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their great contempt and profanation of his <hi>Holy Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>) hid his Face from them, would not assist them against their <hi>Enemies,</hi> but made them to be discomfited. The <hi>Jews</hi> being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at this their unhappy Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their <hi>Enemies,</hi> thought they could force the LORD to be of their side, by carrying the <hi>Ark</hi> of his presence with them.</p>
                     <p>But GOD, who will not suffer himself to be mocked, and when he is provok'd, withdraws his gracious Presence from all the most holy outward Things and Ordinances, suffer'd the <hi>Ark</hi> to go to the <hi>Camp,</hi> without concerning himself about its preservation. No sooner was it arrived there, but the <hi>Army</hi> receiv'd it with a general Shout, and joyful Acclamations, not knowing that the very thing from whence they expected their good success, would prove their Confusion, as well as their great Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and that those two wicked <hi>Priests, Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the <hi>Ark,</hi> and whom GOD regarded with the Eye of his <hi>Wrath,</hi> would draw down more mischief upon them, than the Presence of the <hi>Ark</hi> would procure them favour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Philistins</hi> understanding that the <hi>Ark</hi> was with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> concluded themselves beaten, and crying out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Wo unto us, for their GOD is come into the</hi> Camp; <hi>who should deliver us from those mighty</hi> GODS, <hi>that smote the</hi> Egyptians <hi>with all the Plagues?</hi> However at length, somewhat encouraging one another to quit themselves like <hi>Men,</hi> their fear having made them desperate, they fell like an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible Torrent upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> took the <hi>Ark,</hi> kill'd the two Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> that carried it, cut down 30000 of them, and put the rest to flight.</p>
                     <p>Old <hi>Eli,</hi> all this while, who could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage any great good to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> sat by the Way-side, impatiently expecting to hear the Event of the <hi>Battel,</hi> and the rather, because the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>LORD</hi> was concern'd; that good Man (for so he was, notwithstanding all his failings) trembling at the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of its falling into the hands of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listins,</hi> and being prophaned by them.</p>
                     <p>At last, a Man of <hi>Benjamin</hi> having escap'd out of the <hi>Army,</hi> came to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and gave <hi>Eli</hi> an account of the total defeat of the <hi>Army;</hi> who no sooner heard him say, that the <hi>Ark</hi> was taken; but (like a Man stunn'd with a violent Blow) he fell down from his Seat, and brake his <hi>Neck.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His <hi>Daughter-in-Law,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Phineas,</hi> having understood the Death of her <hi>Husband,</hi> and the taking of the <hi>Ark,</hi> (with the Death also of <hi>Eli</hi> the <hi>High Priest,</hi> her <hi>Father-in-Law</hi>) she immediately fell into Labour, and died soon after she had brought forth a <hi>Son,</hi> whom she called <hi>Ichabod;</hi> because (by the taking of the <hi>Ark</hi>) the <hi>Glory</hi> was departed from <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Never was there a more remarkable Instance of GOD's Severity in punishing the prophanation of Holy things; never a more teaching Lesson, that nothing incenseth GOD higher, than the</hi> Sins <hi>and</hi> Disorderly Lives <hi>of</hi> Priests, <hi>whose Holiness ought to appease the</hi> Divine Wrath, <hi>when it is gone forth against the</hi> People.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It teacheth also us</hi> Christians, <hi>not to put such confidence in the most</hi> Holy Eucharist, <hi>whereof the</hi> Ark <hi>was a</hi> Figure, <hi>as not at the same time to endeavour after</hi> Holiness, <hi>which only can dispose us to be meet partakers of that</hi> Heavenly Bread, <hi>and without which (by approaching to that</hi> Holy Table) <hi>we shall only seal our own Condemnation.</hi>

                     <p>These <hi>Idolaters,</hi> as soon as they saw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves masters of this <hi>Holy thing,</hi> carried it to <hi>Ashdod,</hi> and put it into the <hi>Temple,</hi> near their Idol <hi>Dagon,</hi> excellently representing to us, by this their <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and <hi>Profanation,</hi> the Crime of those, who in the same Heart endeavour to joyn <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Belial,</hi> and to make an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance between his <hi>Holy Worship</hi> and the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Devils.</hi> But <hi>GOD</hi> by an illustrious instance made it appear, that as he is not at all like, so neither can he have any Communion with <hi>false Gods. Dagon</hi> could not stand his ground at the Presence of the <hi>Ark,</hi> and the next Morning they found the <hi>Idol</hi> fallen on its face before it. The <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Ashdod</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly surpriz'd and troubled at this shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fall of their <hi>Idol,</hi> did their endeavours to rear up this <hi>God</hi> again, who was not able to do so much for himself, and put him in his place as before; but the next day they had the affliction to see their <hi>Idol</hi> cast down once more, without either <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet the <hi>Divine Vengeance</hi> did not stop here, but passing from the <hi>Idol</hi> to the <hi>Idolaters</hi> themselves, all the Inhabitants of <hi>Ashdod</hi> were smitten with a shameful and dolorous <hi>Plague,</hi> in the most secret parts of their <hi>Bodies,</hi> at the same time that all the <hi>Fruits</hi> of their Country were destroyed by a prodigious mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>Mice</hi> sent amongst them. This filthy <hi>Plague,</hi> which hindred them from sitting down, by reason of the extream Pain they endur'd in that part; and which was an admirable <hi>Figure</hi> of the shameful and secret <hi>Plagues</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> did so affright and daunt the <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Ashdod,</hi> who were very sensible, that what they suffer'd was an effect of their Outrage done to the <hi>Ark;</hi> being in this respect more happy than they, who (when they are punish'd for their profanation of <hi>Holy things,</hi> are altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, without taking any notice of the Hand of <hi>GOD,</hi> that strikes them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Philistins</hi> therefore being no longer able to endure the Presence of that <hi>GOD,</hi> whose Power they had been made so sensible of, to their great sorrow, sent the <hi>Ark</hi> away to other of their <hi>Cities;</hi> but finding that it still drew the same <hi>Plagues</hi> along with it, and fearing in the end to be all destroyed by it, assembled their <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> to give them advice what was best for them to do in this case; who gave them a Counsel whereby <hi>GOD</hi> was glorified, by an Eternal Monument of his Vengeance exerted against his <hi>Enemies.</hi> They order'd them to send back the <hi>Ark</hi> with five golden Images of the <hi>Emrods,</hi> and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Mice,</hi> wherewith the LORD had plagued them, according to the number of their <hi>Lords</hi> and Principal <hi>Cities,</hi> that had been afflicted with these sore <hi>Judgments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus we see, that the</hi> Divine Glory <hi>shone forth most conspicuously on this occasion, who without the intervening of any human help, forced the</hi> Enemies <hi>themselves to set free the</hi> Holy Ark <hi>from the Captivity wherein it had been detained. The Joy they were seiz'd with, by finding themselves Masters of it, was soon chang'd to extream Grief and Sorrow; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Evils they lay under, making them still fear and apprehend greater, yea, utter and final ruin and destruction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We ought to learn from this</hi> History, <hi>that the Joy Men sometimes have, from their being possest of that which indeed belongs to GOD, always proves a very short and deceitful Joy; and tho' they may not see the</hi> Plague, <hi>wherewith GOD smites them, because it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and in a part that is out of their view</hi> (as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> observes) <hi>yet they must not doubt, but that GOD will sooner or later avenge the abuse and profanation of that which is holy and consecrated to him by the Exemplary and Eternal shame and reproach of those who unjustly have arrogated it, or made themselves Masters of it.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe <hi>Philistins</hi> being no longer able to bear the Presence of the <hi>Ark</hi> of that GOD, who inflicted <hi>Plague</hi> upon <hi>Plague</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The same Year</hi> 2888.</note> followed the Advice of their <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> which was not to send it away empty, but with a <hi>Tresspass-Offering,</hi> which by their Orders were 5 <hi>golden Emerods,</hi> and as many <hi>golden Mice,</hi> according to the number of the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> to the end that ye may be healed; for one <hi>Plague</hi> was on you all, and on your <hi>Lords:</hi> And they also ordered to be provided a new <hi>Cart,</hi> and two <hi>Milch-Kine</hi> to draw it, whose <hi>Calves</hi> they shut up at home from them; to the end, that if the <hi>Kine</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Natural instinct) should take their way towards the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> they might be assured from this supernatural Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that it was not by chance that these <hi>Plagues</hi> had followed them; but that they were a visible effect of the Divine Power, who had thus avenged the Prophanation of the <hi>Ark</hi> of his <hi>Presence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>GOD was willing so far to comply with their weakness, as to make these <hi>Beasts</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Natural tenderness they had for their <hi>Young</hi>) to take the strait Way to <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shemesh,</hi> lowing as they went, which was an evident Token, that their Natural love to their <hi>Young</hi> still continued, but that it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraw'd by Omnipotence it self. Thus they drew it along the High-way that led to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea;</hi> and by this means became an admirable <hi>Figure</hi> to all true <hi>Christians,</hi> teaching them, <hi>That the only way to go to</hi> God, <hi>is by raising ones self above, and thwarting our Earthly</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections <hi>and</hi> Passions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Philistins</hi> followed the <hi>Ark,</hi> as being desirous to be Eye-witnesses of this conspicuous <hi>Miracle,</hi> and were struck with Admiration, when they saw the <hi>Kine</hi> stop as soon as they were come to <hi>Bethshemesh,</hi> which was the first <hi>City</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> they met with on their way.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of this <hi>City</hi> were surpriz'd with extraordinary Joy, to see the <hi>Ark</hi> return'd, as being the precious Pledge of the <hi>Divine Presence</hi> amongst them, for the absence of which all <hi>Israel</hi> had <hi>mourn'd</hi> for the space of 7 <hi>Months.</hi> But alas! this their Joy was soon turned to Tears and Sorrow, when they found that this <hi>holy Pledge</hi> spared the <hi>Jews</hi> as little now, as before it had the <hi>Philistins;</hi> for the <hi>Bethshemites</hi> out of curiosity opening the <hi>Ark</hi> to pry into it, the LORD smote them with a great <hi>Plague,</hi> whereof no less than 50000 died; <hi>because</hi> (saith the <hi>Scripture) they had looked into the</hi> Ark <hi>of the</hi> LORD.</p>
                     <p>The horrour wherewith they were seized at this sudden destruction, made them cry out with fear and trembling, <hi>who is able to stand before this Holy</hi> LORD GOD? Or, <hi>Where shall we bestow this dreadful Pledge of his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Presence?</hi> So they sent Messengers to the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Kiriath-jearim,</hi> to fetch the <hi>Ark</hi> of the LORD the <hi>Philistins</hi> had left with them.</p>
                     <p>They of <hi>Kiriath-jearim</hi> came accordingly, and fetch the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>LORD,</hi> and brought it into the House of <hi>Abinadab,</hi> on the Hill of their <hi>City,</hi> where (being the place which <hi>GOD</hi> had chosen for its abode) he did not only not <hi>Plague</hi> that <hi>Country,</hi> as he had done the <hi>Philistins</hi> and the <hi>Bethshemites,</hi> but blessed them with all manner of <hi>Blessings;</hi> making it apparent to all, that he (of whom the <hi>Ark</hi> was a <hi>Figure</hi>) desires nothing more, than to pour forth his Favours and Benefits upon all those, that do not some way or other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and turn their backs upon them; but withal, when his Justice is provoked, he shews the greatness of his Power, in the punishment of such, who despise and abuse his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Long-suffering.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Bethshemites <hi>seemed to honour the</hi> Ark <hi>by the great expressions of</hi> Joy, <hi>wherewith they received it amongst them after its</hi> 7 Months <hi>Captivity; but their Joy was a proud and vain Joy; they gloried in their being the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors of this</hi> Sacred Pledge, <hi>without being careful humbly to obey the</hi> Law <hi>of that</hi> GOD, <hi>who thence dispersed his</hi> holy Oracles; <hi>and who in a signal manner had imprinted the marks of his</hi> Divine Presence <hi>upon it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus</hi> (saith S. <hi>Gregory) many drawing near to the</hi> Holy Eucharist <hi>with a too bold Confidence, do perish in the</hi> Sanctuary; <hi>because by their care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness to examin themselves, ard neglecting to come with a pure Soul to eat of the</hi> Lamb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemish, <hi>they find their</hi> Death <hi>in that, which to the pure and worthy</hi> Receivers <hi>is a</hi> Spring of Life.</p>

                     <p>THE state of Affairs in <hi>Judea</hi> was such as hath been set down in the foregoing Relations; and GOD made it appear (by his raising <hi>Samuel</hi> to Honour and great Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) that when he is inclin'd to favour a <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>holy Prophet</hi> finding himself animated by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of GOD, preach'd to all <hi>Israel,</hi> representing their <hi>Sins</hi> to them, and promising them, that in case they would relinquish and destroy their <hi>Idols,</hi> and cleave to the LORD, they should be happy and successful for the time to come, and that GOD would deliver them from the Tyranny of the <hi>Philistins.</hi> Whereupon they having declared, that they would follow his Advice, in actually destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Idols</hi> of <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Ashtaroth</hi> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them; <hi>Samuel</hi> commanded them to assemble themselves at <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> that he might pray for them there unto the LORD.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Israelites</hi> being met there from all parts accordingly, they kept a solemn <hi>Fast</hi> to the LORD, humbling themselves before GOD, and confessing their <hi>Sins.</hi> Whilst they were engaged in these Acts of Devotion, they were surprized with the News which was brought them, that the <hi>Philistins</hi> had made an Inroad upon them, and were drawing near to give them Battel.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>Enemies</hi> of GOD's <hi>People,</hi> puft up with their former <hi>Successes,</hi> and knowing that the <hi>Jews</hi> were all assembled at <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> thought they had now a fair occasion offered them to destroy them altogether in one day, and not knowing that <hi>GOD</hi> (who is the sole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposer of <hi>Victory</hi>) was reconcil'd to his <hi>People,</hi> at the Intercession of <hi>Samuel,</hi> they made sure of the same Success they formerly had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Samuel</hi> upon this unexpected Alarm, and the earnest Instances of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he would cry to GOD, to save them from the Hand of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> took a sucking <hi>Lamb</hi> and offered it for a <hi>Burnt-Offering</hi> unto the LORD, which prov'd so acceptable to him, that thundring with prodigious <hi>Thunderclaps</hi> and <hi>Lightnings</hi> upon the <hi>Philistins,</hi> they were thereby struck into such a consternation, that they betook themselves to <hi>flight</hi> in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> taking this occasion to pursue them, kill'd vast numbers, and total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defeated them.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> (by this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which he offer'd to <hi>GOD,</hi> to reconcile him with his <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>) restor'd to the <hi>Jews</hi> their Peace and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and govern'd them afterwards with the care and love of a tender <hi>Father.</hi> But his old Age put a stop to the current of all this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity</hi> he had procur'd for them; for <hi>Samuel's Sons</hi> degenerating from the godliness and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their <hi>Father,</hi> aim'd at nothing more, than to satisfie their <hi>Covetousness</hi> by taking <hi>Bribes,</hi> and perverting <hi>Judgment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From this ill administration of his <hi>Sons,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> took occasion to demand a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> that might govern them, like all other <hi>Nations. Samuel</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly troubled at this their demand;<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2909.

                        </note> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of it to the LORD in Prayer, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd him, that the <hi>Jews</hi> by this demand had affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him himself, by rejecting him to be their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Sovereign;</hi> but however, bade him do as they desired. Yet withal, he charged <hi>Samuel</hi> to set before them how their new <hi>King</hi> would behave himself, and what Treatment they might expect from his <hi>hands,</hi> tho' nothing of all this could alter the Resolution they had fixed, to be like other Nations, let it cost them never so much.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We are apt to admire</hi> (as the <hi>Fathers</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve) <hi>that the</hi> Jews <hi>should be so besotted, as to prefer the Government of a</hi> Man, <hi>before that of</hi> GOD <hi>himself, wherewith they were digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied above all other</hi> Nations <hi>of the</hi> World; <hi>and yet at the same time we do not wonder so much, to see</hi> Christians <hi>preferring the</hi> Devil <hi>to be their</hi> Prince <hi>and</hi> Head, <hi>before</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>himself whose Members they are. For we say often of our</hi> Saviour, <hi>as they in the</hi> Gospel <hi>did;</hi> We will not have this Man to reign over us: <hi>And on the other side, we very frequently tell the</hi> Devil, <hi>not from our</hi> Mouths, <hi>but our</hi> Hearts; Thou art our <hi>King,</hi> and we are thy <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

                     <p>As soon as <hi>Samuel</hi> saw <hi>Saul,</hi> the LORD repeated the same assurance to him, that He was the Man; whereupon <hi>Samuel</hi> invited <hi>Saul</hi> to dine with him, and told him, that he must stay with him that Night, wishing him not to be concern'd about his <hi>Father's Asses,</hi> because they were already found. <hi>Saul,</hi> after he had been entertain'd by <hi>Samuel</hi> with all manner of Honour and Respect, was call'd up by him the next Morning by break of Day, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accompanid him through the <hi>City,</hi> he bid <hi>Saul</hi> command his <hi>Servant</hi> to pass on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for he had something from <hi>GOD</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to him.</p>
                     <p>As soon as <hi>Samuel</hi> saw himself alone with <hi>Saul,</hi> he took a Vial of <hi>Oil</hi> and poured it upon his <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>kissed</hi> him; adding, That what he had done was by express Order of the <hi>LORD,</hi> who had chosen him to be <hi>King</hi> over his People <hi>Israel.</hi> And for proof that what he had said was true, he told him, That on his Way, near to <hi>Rachel's Sepulcher,</hi> he should meet with those, that would tell him that the <hi>Asses</hi> were found, and that his <hi>Father</hi> was no more concern'd about them, but greatly grieved about his <hi>Son,</hi> not knowing what was become of him; and that soon after he should meet with a great number of <hi>Prophets,</hi> and should <hi>prophecy</hi> with them himself.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Man</hi> so happy according to the Eye of the <hi>World,</hi> who in his searching for <hi>Asses,</hi> had found a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> did not give the least hint to his <hi>Father</hi> of what had past. But GOD willing to have him publickly declar'd <hi>King</hi> in presence of all the <hi>People,</hi> ordered <hi>Samuel</hi> to appoint a General Meeting of them at <hi>Mizpeh.</hi> When they were assembled there, <hi>Samuel</hi> represented to them the great Evil they had committed in rejecting GOD, who had so miraculously preserved and deliver'd them, in desiring a <hi>King;</hi> and bade them cast <hi>Lots,</hi> that they might know whom <hi>GOD</hi> had appointed to that Dignity.</p>
                     <p>When they had cast <hi>Lots,</hi> the <hi>Lot</hi> fell upon the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and in that <hi>Tribe,</hi> on <hi>Saul</hi> the Son of <hi>Kish:</hi> who having absented and hid himself, was brought forth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Samuel;</hi> who shewing him to the <hi>People,</hi> told them, That the LORD had chosen him to be their <hi>King,</hi> who was the most comely and tall Person of all <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saul</hi> being declar'd <hi>King,</hi> carried himself at first with a great deal of Modesty and Humility; but not long after he made it appear (and chiefly by the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> he would needs himself offer to GOD, without staying for <hi>Samuel,</hi> to whom that <hi>holy Function</hi> did belong) that it is a rare and difficult thing for Men to continue humble, after they are arriv'd to the highest Pinnacle of <hi>Sovereign Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Fathers <hi>have always consider'd</hi> Saul, <hi>as the</hi> Figure <hi>of those who are chosen to high places either in</hi> Church <hi>or</hi> State, <hi>who ought alway to tremble when they see themselves rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed above others; yea, even when they seem to have great Assurances, that</hi> GOD <hi>himself calls them to those Employments, because if once they lend an Ear to the Enticements of</hi> Pride <hi>and</hi> Ambition, <hi>without considering, that they are the Officers and Servants of that</hi> GOD, <hi>who</hi> resists the Proud, <hi>he at last rejects them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Choice he had before made of them, and takes that away from them, since they are proud, which he had bestowed upon them, when they were humble.</hi>

                           <hi>Jonathan, Saul's</hi> Son (accompanied only with his <hi>Armour-bearer</hi>) goes into the <hi>Camp</hi> of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and puts them to flight.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>SAUL</hi> being establish'd <hi>King,</hi> and waging War against the <hi>Enemies</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> the <hi>Philistins</hi> gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together in great numbers to fight him.<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2911. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1093.</note> 
                        <hi>Saul</hi> on his part was not idle on this occasion, but assembled what <hi>Forces</hi> he could, to oppose their designs: And as both the <hi>Armies</hi> were encamped near one another, after several <hi>Skirmishes</hi> and <hi>Attacks, Jonathan</hi> the Son of <hi>Saul</hi> took a most Heroick Resolution, founded upon his strong Faith and Confidence in GOD; for having call'd his <hi>Armour-bearer,</hi> he communicated to him the design he had formed of setting upon the <hi>Philistins,</hi> as being assured, that it was as easie for the <hi>LORD</hi> to deliver by few as by many, with whose <hi>Blessing</hi> even a single Man might be sufficient to defeat a whole <hi>Army.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As soon as his <hi>Armour-bearer</hi> had declar'd himself willing and ready to accompany him, they both got up an high <hi>Rock,</hi> which was between the <hi>Camp</hi> of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and that of the <hi>Philistins;</hi> and notwithstanding they were discover'd by the <hi>Enemy,</hi> they boldly ventured in the sight of them, to climb up another <hi>Rocky Precipice</hi> upon their Hands and Feet, before they could come to their Out-guards, whom they fell upon, and at the first Onset kill'd 20 of them; which Action ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alarm'd all the <hi>Camp,</hi> and <hi>GOD</hi> at the same time smiting them with Terror and Confusion, they turn'd their <hi>Arms</hi> each Man against his Fellow, routing and defeating themselves.</p>
                     <p>The noise of this their Confusion and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order being heard by the <hi>Israelites; Saul</hi> made enquiry who was found <hi>wanting</hi> amongst them: and being told that <hi>Jonathan</hi> was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>absent he soon guessed what had hapned, and thereupon made all the haste he could to pursue the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and to finish a Victory his <hi>Son</hi> had so happily and couragiously begun. And to the end he might the better husband this happy <hi>opportunity</hi> of giving them a total defeat, and being fully avenged of them, he cursed those that should eat any thing until the <hi>Evening,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Israelites</hi> soon after being come into a <hi>Wood,</hi> where they found store of <hi>Honey,</hi> tho' they were very faint for want of <hi>Meat,</hi> and tir'd with the hard pursuit after the <hi>Philistins,</hi> yet durst not eat any of it, because of the <hi>King's Curse:</hi> But <hi>Jonathan</hi> who knew nothing of what had past, forc'd by extream faintness and weariness, dipt the end of a <hi>Rod</hi> he had in his Hand into an <hi>Honey-Comb;</hi> which he had no sooner tasted, but he found himself wonderfully strengthned and refreshed.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Evening,</hi> after they had refreshed and rested themselves a while, <hi>Saul</hi> made a Proposal of falling again upon the <hi>Philistins</hi> by Night; but thought it adviseable, before he undertook that <hi>Enterprize,</hi> to ask <hi>Counsel</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> as he did, but receiv'd no answer; from whence he concluded, that some one or other of his <hi>Army</hi> had provok'd the LORD, and swore, that whosoever he was (tho' it were <hi>Jonathan</hi> himself) he should certainly die. Accordingly he order'd <hi>Lots</hi> to be cast, and the <hi>Lot</hi> fell upon <hi>Jonathan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saul</hi> seeing his Son taken by the <hi>Lot,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him what he had done? <hi>Jonathan</hi> told him, he had only tasted a little <hi>Honey,</hi> and bemoan'd himself, that for so small a matter he was to die; but <hi>Saul</hi> with a strange firmness persisted in his Resolution of having his <hi>Son</hi> put to death, because he had been the means of hindring the total overthrow of the <hi>Philistins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>People,</hi> who were extreamly pleas'd with this Heroick Undertaking of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> swore, they would never suffer him to be put to death, by whom GOD had wrought so miraculous a Deliverance for them, and so rescued him from his <hi>Father's</hi> Hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> History (say the <hi>Fathers) teacheth us, how dangerous a thing it is to taste never so little</hi> Honey; <hi>that is, the</hi> Pleasures <hi>of this</hi> World; <hi>and to let our selves be seduced by the sweetness of them, after the great and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Victories we have obtain'd against the</hi> Devils, <hi>who are here represented by the</hi> Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE <hi>Sins</hi> of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> being mounted to their <hi>Zenith, GOD</hi> (by the Mouth of <hi>Samuel</hi>) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande <hi>Saul</hi> utterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destroy and exterminate that <hi>Nation,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>GOD being provoked with this rash and presumptuous Disobedience of <hi>Saul</hi> to his express Command, order'd <hi>Samuel</hi> to go and declare to him in his Name, That it repented him that he had elevated him to be <hi>King</hi> over his <hi>People.</hi> At this Command of the <hi>LORD's, Samuel</hi> was grieved, and cried to the <hi>LOD</hi> all Night; but early in the Morning he went to meet <hi>Saul,</hi> who was gone to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> to acquit himself of the Charge GOD had laid upon him; and was inform'd, that <hi>Saul</hi> had caused a <hi>Triumphal Arch</hi> to be erected for his late Victory, the Glory whereof he had sullied and obscured by his Disobedience and Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saul</hi> having understood, that <hi>Samuel</hi> was coming towards him, went to meet him; and after Salutation, told him, That he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the <hi>Commandment</hi> of the <hi>LORD:</hi> But <hi>Samuel</hi> replying, ask'd him, <hi>What meant then the bleating of</hi> Sheep, <hi>and the lowing of</hi> Oxen, <hi>which he heard? Saul</hi> answer'd him, <hi>That the</hi> People <hi>had spared the best of the</hi> Flock <hi>and</hi> Cattle, <hi>for to offer them in</hi> Sacrifice <hi>unto the LORD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that <hi>holy Prophet,</hi> enflam'd with a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Zeal,</hi> represented to that proud <hi>Prince,</hi> his former low Estate, and the Favour and Bounty of <hi>GOD</hi> towards him, in raising him to that high pitch of <hi>Sovereign</hi> Honour and Dignity; and how, notwithstanding all this, he had (for to serve a base Interest, and to comply with the <hi>People</hi>) ventur'd to disobey an express and plain Command of <hi>GOD.</hi> He told him, what aversion the <hi>LORD</hi> had for such <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> that an humble and resign'd Obedience was the thing he above all others requir'd of <hi>Man,</hi> as highly preferable before all <hi>Victims</hi> and <hi>Offerings;</hi> That <hi>Disobedience</hi> was like the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> because he that follows his own Will, sets himself up for a <hi>God:</hi> And in conclusion assured him, that <hi>GOD</hi> had rejected him, and taken his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saul</hi> being touch'd at these Words, confest his <hi>Sin;</hi> tho' this his Confession has always been look'd upon as a <hi>Figure</hi> of false and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Repentance, which is so far from effacing <hi>Sin,</hi> that it encreases it, and stirs up the Anger of GOD, rather than his <hi>Mercy.</hi> For this <hi>Prince,</hi> to shew how little he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at GOD's <hi>Anger,</hi> desired only this Favour of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that at least he would honour him before the <hi>People.</hi> Thus his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition made it appear, how just it was with GOD, not to mind his Hypocritical Confession; for he who minds the <hi>Heart,</hi> found that of <hi>Saul,</hi> fill'd with a passionate desire to be honoured of <hi>Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Samuel,</hi> after all this, commanded <hi>Agag</hi> (King of the <hi>Amalekites</hi>) to be brought before him; and being push'd on by a faithful Zeal, to execute the Orders <hi>GOD</hi> had given, he himself hew'd <hi>Agag</hi> in pieces before the <hi>LORD</hi> in <hi>Gilgal;</hi> thus by a holy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable severity killing him, who had been the ruin of <hi>Saul,</hi> by the false Compassion he had for him.</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>That this memorable Example ought to teach the</hi> Pastors <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>not to make use of a cruel</hi> Pity, <hi>and perverse</hi> Tenderness, <hi>in sparing the</hi> Sins <hi>of those who are committed to their Charge, here represented by the</hi> Amalekites; <hi>but rather to imitate</hi> Samuel, <hi>who without doubt had a greater share of</hi> Charity <hi>than</hi> Saul, <hi>but who at the same time also was too clear-sighted not to know, that in flattering</hi> Sins <hi>by too much Indulgence, we destroy</hi> Sinners; <hi>and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary save them, by healing the Wounds</hi> Sins <hi>have given them, by the sharp Remedy of severe and earnest</hi> Repentance.</p>

For <hi>Samuel</hi> seeing <hi>Eliah</hi> (the eldest of <hi>Jesse's</hi> Sons) a tall <hi>Man</hi> and of a comely proportion, he concluded in himself, that he was the <hi>Man</hi> that was to be <hi>King</hi> over <hi>Israel,</hi> but GOD soon informed him otherwise.</p>
                     <p>At last, when amongst those seven Sons of <hi>Jesse,</hi> he fail'd to find the Man he was to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint, he demanded of <hi>Jesse,</hi> whether those were all the <hi>Children</hi> he had? who told him, he had one more, that was the youngest of them all, who kept his <hi>Sheep</hi> in the <hi>Field. Samuel</hi> wish'd him immediately to send for him, telling him, he would not sit down to eat till he was come.</p>
                     <p>As soon as <hi>David</hi> was come, the <hi>LORD</hi> told <hi>Samuel,</hi> he was the Person he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen; whereupon he took an <hi>Horn</hi> of <hi>Oil</hi> and anointed him in the midst of his <hi>Brethren,</hi> and from that time forward, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>LORD</hi> came upon <hi>David,</hi> and departed from <hi>Saul.</hi> This deplorable <hi>Prince</hi> being abandon'd by the Spirit of <hi>GOD,</hi> became immediately seiz'd by an <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> which cast him into furious Transports, and cruelly tormented him. This Accident, which was a just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of this ingrateful and disobedient <hi>King,</hi> and a sign that ere long he would be devested of the <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> prov'd the beginning of <hi>David's Elevation:</hi> For <hi>Saul</hi> being tormented with the furious Agitations of the <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> his <hi>Courtiers</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> advis'd him to look out for a Man that was skilful in playing on the <hi>Harp,</hi> that the <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> being forc'd to retire at the sweetness of that Harmony, he might be refreshed and come to himself again.</p>
                     <p>Enquiry being made for a Person so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, none was found more expert in that Art than <hi>David:</hi> and was besides of so beautiful an Aspect, that as soon as <hi>Saul</hi> had seen him, and felt the powerful effects of his charming Skill, in driving away the <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> that tormented him, he conceiv'd a great love for him, and preferr'd him to the place of being his <hi>Armour-bearer.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Fathers <hi>look upon this</hi> History <hi>as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and lively</hi> Figure, <hi>representing to us how the true</hi> Ministers <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>pointed out by</hi> David, <hi>ought by the sweetness and energy of their Words and spiritual Discourses, to calm the</hi> Souls <hi>that are tost and agitated by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Whirlwinds of</hi> Passion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>St.</hi> Gregory <hi>observes, that</hi> David <hi>some years after this stood in need of the same help from</hi> Nathan <hi>the</hi> Prophet <hi>(in delivering him from the tyranny of the</hi> Devil <hi>and</hi> Sin, <hi>by his divine and spiritual Remonstrances) which he had only figuratively afforded</hi> Saul, <hi>in giving him a short and unstable satisfaction and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his sweet and harmonious touching of the</hi> Harp; <hi>which however powerful and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it might be, yet was not able to dissipate the black design he had conceived to murther</hi> David, <hi>to whom he was so much obliged.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Psalms <hi>of this holy</hi> King <hi>and</hi> Prophet, <hi>are at this day of greater efficacy and energy than his excelling</hi> Harmony <hi>then was: and spiritual and well-disposed Souls, find them a never-failing help on all occasions, For</hi> (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> well observes) <hi>nothing can be more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and charming than the</hi> Psalms <hi>of</hi> David, <hi>and that Divine Harmony they convey to the open and well purged</hi> Ear; <hi>or more powerful to chase</hi> Evil Spirits, <hi>and attract the</hi> Holy Spirit of God.</p>

                           <hi>David</hi> having killed <hi>Goliah,</hi> the <hi>Jewish Women</hi> came forth to meet <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> with Singing and Dancing, and Instruments of <hi>Musick.</hi>

                     <p>THE Joy and Surprize of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the defeat of <hi>Goliah</hi> was such, that they could not sufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The same year</hi> 2943.</note> neither the danger from which they saw themselves so happily deliver'd, nor the Courage of him who had been the blessed Instrument thereof. King <hi>Saul</hi> began to enquire more particularly who this wonderful Youth was; who was his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and to what <hi>Family</hi> in <hi>Israel</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jonathan</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> who had himself exploited such glorious Actions against the <hi>Philistins,</hi> was so far from bearing a base En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to this wonderful <hi>Stranger,</hi> who by this one <hi>Victory</hi> had dim'd the Lustre of all his most Heroick Actions, that on the contrary he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the greatest <hi>Affection</hi> for him, and lov'd him as his own <hi>Soul;</hi> and as a mark of his entire and unparallel'd Love, he stript himself of his own <hi>Robe, Arms,</hi> and <hi>Ornaments,</hi> and put them upon <hi>David</hi> his Friend.</p>
                     <p>Neither were the <hi>People</hi> wanting to express the admiration and high esteem they had for <hi>David;</hi> for as he return'd from the defeat of <hi>Goliah,</hi> carrying his <hi>Head</hi> in one Hand, and his <hi>Sword</hi> in the other, the <hi>Women</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> came forth in multitudes to meet him, and honour his Triumph with <hi>Singing</hi> and <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi> and all <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Musick,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to us (by these transports of their Joy) those Praises which the <hi>Churches</hi> represented to us by these <hi>Jewish Women,</hi> should one day give unto the <hi>LORD Jesus Christ,</hi> to honour his Victory and Triumph over the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nevertheless this <hi>Triumph</hi> (which was but a just acknowledgment of the Salvation <hi>David</hi> had wrought for all <hi>Israel</hi>) was the beginning of his Sufferings, and had lik'd to have prov'd fatal to him, if by his <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>GOD's Care</hi> over him, it had not been prevented. For the <hi>Women</hi> in their <hi>Songs</hi> of <hi>Joy</hi> declaring, <hi>That</hi> Saul <hi>had kill'd his Thousands, but</hi> David <hi>his Ten thousands,</hi> did so irritate and provoke that proud <hi>Prince,</hi> and so possest him with Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, that instead of imitating the generous Motions of his Son <hi>Jonathan,</hi> he abandon'd himself to cruel Envy, which made him ever after to look upon <hi>David</hi> with extream ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and malice, whom till then he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd as the only Person in his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that deserv'd his Affection most, and to whom he (in some sort) ow'd his Crown. He complain'd highly of the bold Impertinence of his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> who attributed only the defeat of <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands</hi> to him, at the same time when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd <hi>David</hi> for having slain his <hi>Ten Thousands:</hi> and the trouble and disorder that this <hi>Passion</hi> engaged him in from that time forwards to the day of his Death, may serve as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Lesson to all the <hi>World,</hi> but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to those who have Authority in the <hi>Church,</hi> that they ought to fear nothing more than Envy, tho' unhappy Experience makes it appear every day, (as S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observes) <hi>That as nothing is more ordinary in the</hi> World, <hi>so it is also frequently found in the</hi> Church of Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The more that</hi> Men <hi>of large</hi> Hearts, <hi>and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous unbiast</hi> Spirits <hi>signalize themselves, and shine forth in great and glorious</hi> Graces <hi>and</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>the less can we endure them; and the lustre of their</hi> Virtues <hi>scorches some, at the same time that it enlightens and cherisheth others.

                     <p>
                        <hi>But great reason have such as these to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themselves in the unjust Persecutions of their</hi> Adversaries, <hi>forasmuch as they not only have the Approbation of all good and pious</hi> Men, <hi>who not being blinded or biast by</hi> Passion, <hi>judge of things as they are in themselves, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their just value: but also the favour and good will of</hi> GOD, <hi>who is the Patron and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of vertuous and gracious</hi> Souls; <hi>and who at the same time that they meet with envious haters and persecutors, does highly exalt them in the esteem of others, who honour</hi> Vertue <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they meet with it, and respect it by so much the more, as it is persecuted and oppressed by the</hi> Wicked <hi>and</hi> Ungodly; <hi>as knowing that</hi> GOD <hi>will in his due time, sooner or later, crown all those that suffer for</hi> Righteousness sake.</p>

                        <hi>David,</hi> tho' he was not so stupid, as not to perceive, that all this was levell'd only at his ruin, accepted of the Condition very readily, and making an excursion with his Regiment upon the <hi>Philistins,</hi> kill'd 200 of them, and deliver'd their <hi>Fore-skins</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> being double the number he had requir'd of him; and thereupon was married to <hi>Michal</hi> his <hi>Daughter.</hi>

                        <hi>Saul</hi> in the mean time perceiving that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he design'd for <hi>David's</hi> ruin and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, turn'd to his great glory and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, was strangely enraged, and endeavour'd again to strike him through with his <hi>Javelin,</hi> as he was playing before him: but <hi>David</hi> happily avoided the stroke and fled, as before. <hi>Jonathan</hi> seeing his <hi>Father</hi> thus vehemently bent to kill <hi>David,</hi> did his utmost endeavour by soft Perswasives and moving Arguments, to change the <hi>Heart</hi> of his <hi>Father</hi> towards him, but all in vain; for not long after, nothing being able to satisfie his <hi>Rage</hi> but <hi>David's</hi> Death, he sent armed Men to beset his House in the Night, in order to kill him the next Morning; but <hi>Michal</hi> his Wife, who loved him as well as her <hi>Father</hi> hated him, let him down through a <hi>Window,</hi> to make his escape; and when the Men came that <hi>Saul</hi> had sent to kill him, they found nothing in his <hi>Bed,</hi> but an <hi>Image Michal</hi> had laid there to deceive them, and give <hi>David</hi> time to get so far out of Town, that they might not be able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> having escaped this Danger, came to <hi>Samuel,</hi> who upon his coming retired to <hi>Naioth,</hi> where they dwelt together. But <hi>Saul</hi> being inform'd, that <hi>David</hi> was got to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> sent Messengers to fetch him thence; who as soon as they came amongst the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> that were with <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Spirit of the <hi>LORD</hi> came upon them, and they prophesied. <hi>Saul</hi> wondring that none of the <hi>Officers</hi> he had sent to take <hi>David,</hi> return'd to give him any account of the matter he had charg'd them with, was resolv'd to go and see what might be the reason of it, and to do that himself which his <hi>Officers</hi> had been backward or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in; but he also no sooner came amongst the <hi>Prophets,</hi> but he prophesied likewise, and so return'd without harming <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saul <hi>made it appear, by the frustration of all his designs against</hi> David, <hi>that the most powerful Men in the</hi> World <hi>can no farther make use of their Power, than as GOD permits, who when he pleases sets bounds to ther Violence, and stops them in the midst of their furious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, and with a wonderful facility delivers those he has a mind to save, from the hands of Men, either by making them love those he favours, as</hi> Jonathan, <hi>or unable to hurt them, as</hi> Saul.</p>

                     <p>One of the greatest Troubles <hi>David</hi> found in this his Vagabond state, was the care that lay upon him to provide for the six Hundred Men that always accompanied him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having lately escaped the hands of the <hi>Ziphites,</hi> who intended to betray him to <hi>Saul,</hi> he thought of providing some Refreshments for himself and his Men, who had been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably harassed with <hi>Marches</hi> and <hi>Countermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> for many days together; and to this end, sent ten Men to <hi>Nabal,</hi> a rich and wealthy Man, but of a bruitish and insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Temper;<note place="margin">Anno Mundi. 2947. <hi>being the year wherein</hi> Samuel <hi>died<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being near</hi> 100 <hi>years of Age.</hi>

                        <hi>Abishai</hi> seeing so favourable an opportunity offered, for <hi>David</hi> to rid himself at once of all his Troubles, and to set the <hi>Crown</hi> upon his own Head, earnestly entreated him to give him leave to kill <hi>Saul,</hi> whom <hi>GOD</hi> had so providentially delivered into his hands; but <hi>David</hi> respecting in his Enemy the holy <hi>Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> wherewith he had been Anointed <hi>King</hi> over <hi>Israel,</hi> by special Command from the <hi>LORD,</hi> would not suffer <hi>Abishai</hi> to touch him; contenting himself to take away his <hi>Spear</hi> and <hi>Cruse</hi> of <hi>Water,</hi> that stood at his <hi>Beds-head</hi> as he lay asleep.</p>
                     <p>This done, <hi>David</hi> being return'd to his Men, called with a loud Voice to <hi>Abner,</hi> the Captain of <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Guards,</hi> and reproached to him and the whole Army their negligence in keeping their <hi>King;</hi> telling them, they had deserved to be punish'd with Death for this their Carelesness; and at the same time shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the <hi>Kings Spear</hi> he had taken from his Beds-side, whilst they slept. <hi>Saul</hi> awaking with the Noise, and hearing <hi>David</hi>'s Voice, called him his Son, and spake to him with a great deal of seeming Tenderness. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>David</hi> took occasion (with the greatest submission) to demand of <hi>Saul,</hi> wherefore he pursued one of his faithful Servants, with so much Animosity and Violence? He represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him the Innocence of his Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, telling him, that if the <hi>LORD</hi> had stir'd him up against him, he should hope to appease him with an <hi>Offering;</hi> but if they were Men that provok'd him to this persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pursuing of him, whereby he was driven from the <hi>LORD</hi>'s <hi>Inheritance</hi> and his <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> that they were accurst for so doing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saul</hi> had nothing to answer to these just Complaints of <hi>David,</hi> but openly confessed his Sin in what he had done, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his Folly; assuring him, that he might return to his home when he pleased, for that he was resolved never more to seek after him, to do him any harm. <hi>David</hi> hereupon shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Spear,</hi> and desired him to send some one to fetch it; concluding with this wish, that <hi>GOD</hi> (who renders to every one according to his <hi>Works</hi>) would be pleased to let his Life be as precious in his <hi>Eyes,</hi> as the Life of <hi>Saul</hi> had been in his, whom he had spared, when <hi>GOD</hi> delivered him into his hands; and that in his due time he would be pleas'd to deliver him from all his Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>GOD,</hi> who with his favour and good will always accompanied <hi>David,</hi> by a <hi>happy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident</hi> deliver'd him from the perplexing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being forc't, either to take <hi>Arms</hi> and fight against his own Countrymen the <hi>Jews;</hi> or in case of his Refusal, to fall a <hi>Victim</hi> to the rage of <hi>Achish;</hi> for the <hi>LORDS</hi> and great Men amongst the <hi>Philistins,</hi> fearing that <hi>David</hi> being a <hi>Jew,</hi> might in the Fight take occasion to betray them, or at least to run over to the <hi>Enemy,</hi> and thereby dishearten their <hi>Army,</hi> desired <hi>Achish</hi> to make him return to <hi>Ziklag.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Achish</hi> had entertain'd so good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>David,</hi> that he excused him to the <hi>LORDS</hi> of the <hi>Philistins;</hi> assuring them, that now for some years he had experience of his <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> and that they had no reason to fear any such Treachery by him; but the <hi>LORDS</hi> persisting in their former Resolution, oblig'd <hi>Achish</hi> to desire <hi>David</hi> to return, who dismist him with very high Commendations, and Assurances of the good Opinion he had of him, and that he was troubled, to see that his <hi>LORDS</hi> without any reason did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust and suspect him.</p>
                     <p>This perplexity being overpast, another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident hapned upon the neck of it, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a most sensible Sorrow and Affliction to <hi>David,</hi> and all that were with him: For when they were come to <hi>Ziklag,</hi> they found the <hi>City</hi> burnt with Fire, and all their <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and all that they had, carried away by the <hi>Amalekites. David</hi> and his Men being equally sharers in this sad Misfortune, were overwhelmed with grief and sorrow, weeping and lamenting till they were able to weep no longer; and, to increase <hi>David</hi>'s di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, the Men that were with him, in the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and bitterness of their Spirits, for the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loss they had sustained, spake of stoning him, as if he had been the cause of this Disaster.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithstanding all this <hi>David</hi> was not cast down, but comforting himself in the <hi>LORD</hi> his <hi>GOD,</hi> who had so frequently and so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously deliver'd him from so many immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dangers, he took courage, and calling to <hi>Abiathur</hi> the <hi>High Priest,</hi> to bring the <hi>Ephod</hi> to him, he enquired of the <hi>LORD,</hi> whether he should pursue the <hi>Amalekites</hi>? and if so, whether he should overtake and conquer them? The <hi>Divine Oracle</hi> having assur'd <hi>David</hi> of good success, he marches in pursuit of them with all his Men; but 200 of them were so faint, for want of Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being tired with continual marching, and cast down with sorrow, that <hi>David</hi> was fain to leave them by the way, the other 400 following him, in hopes to overtake those <hi>Robbers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On their way they happily lighted on an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had left behind them, being one of their Servants, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>David</hi> which way the <hi>Amalekites</hi> were gone, and guided him to the place where they were spread abroad upon the ground, <hi>eating, drinking,</hi> and <hi>dancing,</hi> because of the great Spoil they had taken out of the Land of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and out of the Land of <hi>Judah.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> and his Men fell upon them, and killed every Man of them, except 400 young Men, who fled upon <hi>Camels</hi> and made their escape; and took all the <hi>Spoil</hi> they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, so that nothing was wanting to any of them, of all they had left in <hi>Ziklag;</hi> over and above which, they took a great <hi>Booty</hi> from them, which they had plundered elsewhere.

                           <hi>Saul</hi>'s Army is defeated: Three of his <hi>Sons</hi> are slain in the <hi>Battle,</hi> and being sorely wounded he falls upon his own <hi>Sword,</hi> and kills himself.</p>

                     <p>This unhappy <hi>King</hi> being forsaken by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> was seiz'd with a presaging Fear and Trembling at the approach of the <hi>Philistins Army,</hi> and having several ways en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of the <hi>LORD</hi> concerning the Event of the <hi>Battel,</hi> without receiving any Answer, he as one mad and desperate, addresses himself to the <hi>Devil,</hi> for that which he found he could not obtain from <hi>GOD;</hi> and notwithstanding the severe <hi>Laws</hi> he had made against <hi>Witches,</hi> went himself now to consult them.</p>
                     <p>On this design, having disguis'd himself, he goes (being accompanied only by two of his <hi>Servants</hi>) by Night to a <hi>Witch,</hi> and prays her to raise up <hi>Samuel</hi> before him. But the <hi>Witch</hi> (at the appearance of <hi>Samuel</hi>) perceiving that it was King <hi>Saul,</hi> who was come to her in that disguise, and not doubting but that he was come on purpose to betray her, and have an occasion to condemn her in conformity to the <hi>Law</hi> he had made against those of her wicked Profession, was sorely affrighted; but being assured by <hi>Sauls</hi> Protestations to the contrary, she proceeded to gratifie his desire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saul</hi> having enquir'd of her the Habit and Form of the Person she had rais'd, and being told by the <hi>Witch,</hi> that he was an Old Man cover'd with a <hi>Mantle,</hi> perceived that it was <hi>Samuel,</hi> and bowed himself with his face to the ground. But <hi>Samuel</hi> with a dreadful Voice asked <hi>Saul,</hi> why he had disquieted him, and raised him by <hi>Magick</hi> Art; seeing the <hi>LORD</hi> had forsaken him, and was now with <hi>David,</hi> who was to Reign in his stead? He told him, that this was the very time <hi>GOD</hi> would fulfil his denunciations against him, rend his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> from him, and deliver him into the hands of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and that the next day he and his Sons should be with him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Samuel</hi> at these words disappeared, and <hi>Saul</hi> struck with the horror of this denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the terrors of a guilty <hi>Conscience,</hi> fell down flat to the ground. The <hi>Woman</hi> seeing him in this condition, desired him to get up and refresh himself by eating a bit of <hi>Meat;</hi> but <hi>Saul</hi> (notwithstanding he was faint for want of nourishment, as having fasted all that day, and the night before) refused to eat any thing. The <hi>Idea</hi> of the Tragical <hi>Exit</hi> he and his Sons were to make the next day, had already wholly taken up his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the time appointed by <hi>Samuel</hi> hastning upon him, he carried to the <hi>Battel</hi> a Heart assur'd of a certain defeat. In fine, his <hi>Troops</hi> were cut in pieces, his Sons killed, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self expecting Death at every moment, which he knew was inevitable; and having receiv'd several <hi>Wounds,</hi> desired his <hi>Armour-bearer</hi> to kill him; which he refusing to do, he fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own <hi>Sword</hi> and killed himself; his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-bearer</hi> following his <hi>Master</hi>'s Example.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the end of this unhappy <hi>Prince,</hi> who for having spared <hi>Amalek</hi> by an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and ungodly Compassion, and without cause murthered so many of the <hi>Priests</hi> of the <hi>LORD,</hi> was forced to avenge these <hi>Crimes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself, by falling upon his own <hi>Sword:</hi> happy had he been, could he either always have continued in a private condition, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly practis'd that Humility of which he gave some pregnant Instances at his first ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the <hi>Throne:</hi> But the greatness of his Authority and Power dazled his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up his <hi>Heart,</hi> and by stopping his <hi>Ears</hi> to the Voice of the <hi>LORD,</hi> and his <hi>Prophets,</hi> his fair and promising beginnings terminated in a most tragical End, and has made him a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Example to all proud and ungodly <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> throughout all Ages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This made some of the</hi> Fathers <hi>say, That</hi> Saul <hi>in the</hi> Old Testament, <hi>does much resemble</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das <hi>in the</hi> New; <hi>both of them being at first chosen of</hi> GOD, <hi>and afterwards rejected, the one for his</hi> Pride, <hi>the other for his</hi> Avarice, <hi>they both fell into despair; and may teach the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest always to tremble and stand in awe, and to be afraid of being raised up to Honour, lest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted up in their</hi> Minds, <hi>they should lose the Grace of</hi> Humility, <hi>without which no Man can be acceptable to</hi> GOD.</p>

                     <p>But <hi>David,</hi> who was guided by other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, conceiv'd very different Sentiments on this occasion; for shutting his Eyes to the Good the Death of <hi>Saul</hi> was like to procure him, as well as to the Fatigues and Troubles it would deliver him from, with an unfeigned Sorrow lamented the Death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> compos'd an <hi>Elegy</hi> or <hi>Song</hi> of Mourning for them, Cursing the Mountains of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> on which those two Mighty <hi>Princes</hi> had been unhappily slain.

                        <hi>David,</hi> who found himself pierc'd with a sensible Grief at this Relation, was so far from thinking himself obliged to a Man, who tho' he brought him <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Crown,</hi> yet at the same time confest that he had contributed to his <hi>Death;</hi> that rending his <hi>Cloaths,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of this <hi>Amalekite,</hi> how he durst be so bold to lay his hand on the <hi>Lords Anointed</hi>? And at the same time commanded one of his Attendants to kill him; leaving (by this his Behaviour) a great <hi>Example</hi> to us all, never to rejoice at the Death of our <hi>Enemies,</hi> or at the Evils that happen to them.</p>
                     <p>After the Death of this miserable <hi>Prince, David</hi> having first ask'd Counsel of GOD, return'd to <hi>Judea,</hi> where the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> Proclaimed and Anointed him <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Hebron,</hi> when he was about 30 years of Age. <hi>Abner</hi> in the mean time (who was General of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Army) set up <hi>Ishbosheth, Saul</hi>'s Son, to be King over the other <hi>Tribes;</hi> but he being 5 years after murthered by two <hi>Ruffians,</hi> who brought his Head to <hi>David</hi> as a Present, which they supposed could not choose but be very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him, <hi>David</hi> expresseth no more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the death of the <hi>Son,</hi> (which entred him into a peaceful possession of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of all <hi>Israel,</hi>) than before he had testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the Death of the <hi>Father,</hi> which put him into possession of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Judah:</hi> And having given the same Reward to these two <hi>Villains</hi> (who without doubt had already swallowed the hopes of great Treasures and Honours, as a reward for this their Villany) which before he had given to the <hi>Amalekite,</hi> who brought him the tiding of the Death of <hi>Saul</hi> and his <hi>Crown,</hi> he by this repeated <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> exhibited an illustrious Instance of his unparallel'd generosity and sweetness of Temper and Disposition; <hi>Who was so far from insulting over the Misfortune of his</hi> Enemies, <hi>or to make their Miseries (notwithstanding the great Admantages they procur'd to him) the matter of his Joy and Triumph, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he heartily lamented and sorrowed for their Mishap, and severely avenged their</hi> Death.</p>

                  <head>The CONTENTS of the Second Book of <hi>SAMUEL</hi> otherwise called the Second Book of the <hi>KINGS.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN this <hi>Book</hi> are recited the Matters that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned since the Death of <hi>Saul,</hi> under the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>David.</hi> We find therein a lively representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the incomprehensible Grace, and singular Favour of <hi>GOD</hi> towards him.</p>
                  <p>First in regard of Temporal Blessings; <hi>GOD</hi> having raised him by his wonderful Providence, after manifold Troubles and Afflictions, to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> and afterwards to that of all <hi>Israel,</hi> to the great comfort of his <hi>People;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving besides blessed him with a numerous <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,</hi> brave <hi>Officers,</hi> valiant <hi>Soldiers,</hi> and adorned him in his own <hi>Person</hi> with a most <hi>Heroical Generosity,</hi> established his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> greatly extended and enlarged the Limits of it, and Crowned his <hi>Wars</hi> with many <hi>Victories,</hi> obtain'd against his <hi>Enemies,</hi> as well at home as abroad.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In regard of <hi>Spiritual Mercies,</hi> by governing him by the Spirit of <hi>Faith, Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Prophesie,</hi> inspiring him with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Godliness, and an unparallel'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to his <hi>Service,</hi> by enriching him with all the <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> with <hi>Wisdom, Justice, Clemency, Humility,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and other such like, which did shine forth most brightly in all his Behaviour and Government: And over and above all this, by making him a <hi>Promise</hi> (occasion'd by his intention to build him a <hi>House</hi>) concerning the <hi>Spiritual, Celestial,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Reign</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> our <hi>LORD</hi> and <hi>Saviour JESUS CHRIST,</hi> who should be born of his <hi>Seed,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Flesh,</hi> of whom he had made him a <hi>Figure,</hi> as well as his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary, here are also set forth very particularly, the great Sins wherewith this excellent <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> was at times defiled, to the provocation of his great Benefactor, being overcome by the Deceit of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the infirmity of his <hi>Flesh;</hi> above all, in the Matter of <hi>Uriah</hi> the <hi>Hittite,</hi> and in his proud Numbering of the <hi>People;</hi> of which he (by the Grace of <hi>GOD</hi>) most heartily and sincerely repented; yet notwithstanding was therefore most severely chastised and punished by <hi>GOD,</hi> for his own good and the edification of his <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amongst the Chastisements of <hi>GOD</hi> upon him for his <hi>Sins,</hi> we may reckon his Son <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s Ravishing of his Sister <hi>Tamar,</hi> who two years after for that Fact was murthered by his Brother <hi>Absalom</hi>'s Command, who for that purpose had invited him and all the <hi>Kings Sons</hi> to a <hi>Feast;</hi> as likewise that horrible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy and Rebellion of <hi>Absalom</hi> his Son against him, whereby he was forced in his old Age to flee before him, though indeed the <hi>LORD</hi> never forsook him, neither in his extremity or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; but on the contrary strengthned and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him by a firm Faith and Confidence, and afforded him a good and favourable Issue; by giving him the <hi>Victory</hi> over his <hi>Enemies;</hi> by defeating and infatuating their <hi>Councils</hi> against him; and by turning all things in the end to his good and advantage; as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand to the utter ruin of his <hi>Oppressors</hi> and <hi>Adversaries,</hi> that so he might shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Holy and Faithful <hi>GOD,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the divers defects, sins, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness of his <hi>Children,</hi> doth inviolably keep his gracious <hi>Covenant</hi> with them, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least approving of, or indulging them in their <hi>Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Book</hi> contains the <hi>History</hi> of about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years <hi>(Chap. 5. ver. 4.)</hi> from the beginning of <hi>David's</hi> Reign, to the end thereof; except only, that the last Conspiracy of his <hi>Son Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah,</hi> and his Death, are not here inserted, but are set down at the beginning of the following <hi>Book,</hi> which is the first of <hi>Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It seems as if the former part of the first Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> was writ by <hi>Samuel</hi> himself; but the rest of it, with this of the second Book of <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> (as well as the Books of <hi>Kings</hi>) were writ by other holy <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> inspired by <hi>GOD;</hi> such as <hi>Nathan, Gad,</hi> and others.</p>

                     <p>No sooner had <hi>David</hi> made himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and that the Affairs of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> began to be setled, but he expressed more <hi>Piety;</hi> that is, <hi>Love to GOD and his Worship,</hi> than ever <hi>Saul</hi> had testified during all his Reign. For whereas that Miserable <hi>Prince</hi> had no concern for the <hi>Ark,</hi> or any thoughts of fetching it from the House of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binadab,</hi> since the time that the <hi>Philistins</hi> sent it back about 70 years ago, <hi>David</hi> was so far from imitating him in this his Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that on the contrary having gathered together about 30000 of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> he went with them in Triumph to fetch the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>LORD</hi> from the House of <hi>Abinadab,</hi> and to bring it to the City of <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Solemnity was celebrated with all the Pomp and Magnificence, as well as with all the testifications of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Gladness,</hi> which <hi>Davids</hi> great Piety could prompt him to. He himself play'd on his <hi>Harp</hi> before the <hi>Ark,</hi> at the same time when all his <hi>Subjects,</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their <hi>King,</hi> sounded forth their Joy from their <hi>Mouths,</hi> as well as from all sorts of <hi>Instruments,</hi> praising and magnifying the <hi>LORD,</hi> that dwelt between the <hi>Cherubims.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilst this holy Pomp and Solemnity fill'd the hearts of all the <hi>People</hi> with great joy and satisfaction, to see that Sacred Pledge of the Divine Presence so happily restor'd unto them, (the happy effects of which they had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of so long) an unlookt for Accident hapned, which immediately chang'd all this joy into sadness, and dampt the Spirits of the <hi>Jews</hi> with horror and amazement; for <hi>Uzzah</hi> the Son of <hi>Abinadab,</hi> who guided the <hi>Cart,</hi> on which they had placed the <hi>Ark,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the <hi>Oxen</hi> that drew it, stumble, and that the <hi>Ark</hi> thereby was in danger of falling, laid hold on it with his hand to prevent that mischance; but instead of hindring the <hi>Ark</hi> from falling, he himself fell down dead to the ground, being struck by <hi>GOD,</hi> for his rashness in laying hold on the <hi>Ark. For</hi> (as the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> saith) <hi>GOD</hi>'s <hi>Anger was kindled against</hi> Uzzah, <hi>and he smote him for his rash Error in medling with the</hi> Ark.</p>
                     <p>All those who were Witnesses of this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Judgment and Instance of the <hi>Divine Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,</hi> were seiz'd with fear, and called the name of the place <hi>Perez-Uzzah;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> himself being strangely effected therewith, chang'd the resolution he had taken of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Ark</hi> to him, to the City of <hi>David;</hi> but instead thereof carried it aside to the House of <hi>Obed-edom</hi> the <hi>Hittite,</hi> where it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued three Months, during which time the <hi>LORD</hi> multiplied his Blessings upon the House of <hi>Obed-edom,</hi> and all that belonged to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We see by this Example, that the Presence of such a terrible</hi> GOD, <hi>as our</hi> GOD <hi>is, frighted</hi> David <hi>from bringing the</hi> Ark <hi>to the place he had prepared for it in</hi> Jerusalem; <hi>and this Apprehension ought more justly to seize us, who are less righteous than</hi> David, <hi>for fear lest in these our days some Stranger like</hi> Uzzah, <hi>who is not called to the Ministry and Service of the</hi> Ark, <hi>might suffer himself to be deceived by an indiscreet</hi> Zeal, <hi>or some specious Pretext to put forth his Hand rashly to those</hi> Mysteries, <hi>which do not comport with the state and degree in which he is, and so provoke the Wrath of</hi> GOD <hi>against him, by a Service which he supposed most acceptable to him.</hi>

                           <hi>The same Year</hi> 2959.</note> GOD had blessed the House of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed-edom,</hi> where the <hi>Ark</hi> had continued du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time; he resolved a second time to bring it to him to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And fearing that the Death of <hi>Uzzah</hi> was partly occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, because there were no <hi>Levites</hi> nor <hi>Priests</hi> to attend the <hi>Ark,</hi> to whom that holy Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did particularly appertain, he ordered a great number of them to be in a readiness, not to guide it in a <hi>Cart,</hi> as before, but to carry it on their <hi>Shoulders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus with a very solemn and triumphant Procession, did <hi>David</hi> and all the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> bring up the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>LORD,</hi> with shouting, and with the sound of <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and other Instruments of <hi>Musick;</hi> and when they that bare the <hi>Ark</hi> had gone six Paces, <hi>David</hi> sacrificed <hi>Oxen</hi> and <hi>Fatlings;</hi> and being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self clothed in a <hi>Linnen Ephod,</hi> he danced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it with all his might. In this manner the holy <hi>Ark</hi> entred into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> being carried through a prodigious Throng of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who from all parts of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> were come to assist at that Solemnity, and to partake of this universal Joy, to the <hi>Tent</hi> and <hi>Tabernacle David</hi> had caused to be erected for it.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Michal,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Saul, David's</hi> Wife, as she was looking out of a <hi>Window,</hi> to see the <hi>Ark</hi> pass by, seeing <hi>David</hi> without his <hi>Royal Robes</hi> assisting at the Solemnity, and leaping and dancing before the <hi>Ark</hi> in a <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Ephod,</hi> she despised him in her Heart, conceiving a great disdain for this his <hi>Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> which to her seem'd so disproportionate to his Royal Dignity and Authority.</p>
                     <p>Now when <hi>David</hi> had set the <hi>Ark</hi> in its Place, to wit, in the midst of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> that he had pitched for it, and had offered <hi>Burnt-Offerings,</hi> and <hi>Peace-Offerings</hi> before the LORD, and had distributed to all the People, as well <hi>Women</hi> as <hi>Men,</hi> to each a <hi>Cake</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> a good piece of <hi>Flesh,</hi> and a <hi>Flagon</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> and was returned to his <hi>Houshold,</hi> to bless it in the Name of the <hi>LORD of Hosts, Michal</hi> his Wife meeting him, in a deriding way said to him; <hi>How glorious was the King of</hi> Israel <hi>to day, who laying aside the Marks of his</hi> Majesty, <hi>uncover'd himself in the</hi> Eyes <hi>of the Handmaids of his Servants, skipping and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before his</hi> Subjects <hi>as one of the vain Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that openly exposes himself for the Laughter and Diversion of others?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>David,</hi> whose <hi>Soul</hi> was raised far above these <hi>Female</hi> Sentiments and false Notions of <hi>Honour,</hi> and without being troubled, or blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her disdainful Mockery, told her with some earnestness; <hi>What I have done this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have done to the Honour of</hi> GOD, <hi>and in his sight, who hath chosen me before thy</hi> Father, <hi>and before all his</hi> House, <hi>of whom I hold my</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>and to whom alone I owe this peaceful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment on the Throne of</hi> Israel: <hi>Wherefore if you think this a vilifying of my self, you are like to see more of it: for I am resolved to be yet more vile than this, and to be base in my own sight, and will raise my Glory by humbling my self before the</hi> LORD, <hi>in the presence of the meanest of my</hi> Subjects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus this</hi> Holy King, <hi>forgetting his Sovereign Dignity, and so many</hi> Victories <hi>he had obtained over</hi> Men <hi>as well as</hi> Beasts; <hi>over</hi> Monsters <hi>in bulk and strength; over all sorts of</hi> Enemies, <hi>and in all sorts of</hi> Dangers, <hi>being great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in the Eyes of all, was only base and little in his own. He despiseth himself, and does not take it ill that others do so too.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>David <hi>(by this illustrious Example of his) teacheth all</hi> Christian Princes <hi>never to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the abasing or lessening of their</hi> Majesty, <hi>by submitting themselves to</hi> GOD, <hi>and in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their</hi> Subjects <hi>an Example of the humble Adorations and Service they owe to the Supream</hi> Majesty <hi>of</hi> Heaven. <hi>And 'tis a sign, That they are afraid of</hi> Womens <hi>Talk, who fear on such occasions as these, to prostitute their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Authority.

                           <hi>David</hi> sends <hi>Joab</hi> with an <hi>Army</hi> against the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> to avenge himself of the Outrage done to his <hi>Ambassadors</hi> by <hi>Hanun</hi> their <hi>King,</hi> who used them like <hi>Spies</hi>

                     <p>WHen the Civil Wars, which <hi>David</hi> had been engaged in a great while, aginst <hi>Israel</hi> and the House of <hi>Saul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2967. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1037.</note> were happily ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by the death of <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> being now free from intestine Divisions, as well as from Wars with those <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who till then had possessed some portion of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> he hapned to be engaged in a War against the <hi>Ammonites</hi> upon this occasion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nahash</hi> King of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> dying, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (in acknowledgment of the Kindness he had received from him in his Life) resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to send Ambassadors to his Son <hi>Hanun,</hi> to condole the Death of his <hi>Father,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his Accession to the <hi>Crown,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to offer him his Friendship for his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> sake, who had always been his kind <hi>Friend.</hi> As soon as <hi>David's Ambassadors</hi> were arriv'd at the Court of <hi>Hanun,</hi> King of the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> his <hi>Lords</hi> perswaded him, that these <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of <hi>David</hi> were no other than <hi>Spies,</hi> and tho' they pretended to come to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> him, and in honour to his Father; yet their true intent was only to discover their strength, that they might be the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to overthrow them upon occasion, and make themselves Masters of his <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hanun,</hi> too flexible and easie of belief, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himself to be seduced by these Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his <hi>Lords,</hi> and supposing that what they suggested was true indeed, he treated them in the most villainous and outragious manner imaginable: he ordered the one half of their <hi>Beards</hi> to be shaved, and cut off their <hi>Garments</hi> below their <hi>Waists,</hi> and so sent them away. <hi>David</hi> being inform'd thereof, very highly resented this <hi>Affront</hi> done to his <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives,</hi> and being much concern'd for the shameful condition wherein <hi>Hanun</hi> had sent them away, he sent <hi>Messengers</hi> to meet them, and comfort them, ordering them by no <hi>means</hi> to shew themselves at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to stay at <hi>Jericho</hi> till their <hi>Beards</hi> were grown, and that after that they might come up to the <hi>Court.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> in the mean time resolved not to let this heinous <hi>Affront</hi> go unpunished; and the rather, because that he heard that the <hi>Ammonites</hi> were making great Warlike Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations and Alliances against him, with the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and other of their Neighbours, of whom they had procured very numerous <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> to assist them against <hi>Israel. David</hi> being informed of all this, thought it was no time for him to be an idle <hi>Spectator,</hi> but sent <hi>Joab</hi> with the choicest of his <hi>Forces</hi> to fight the <hi>Ammonites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joab</hi> being come in sight of the <hi>Enemy,</hi> he found their <hi>Army</hi> so posted, that the <hi>Israelites,</hi> before they were aware, had an <hi>Enemy</hi> before and behind them; wherefore <hi>Joab</hi> (with the choice of the <hi>Army</hi>) resolved to fall on the <hi>Syrians,</hi> whilst <hi>Abishai</hi> his Brother, with the rest of the <hi>Troops,</hi> set upon the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising each other, that the stronger should come to the help of the weaker. <hi>Joab</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving encouraged his Men, set upon the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> with that Conduct and Valour, that they were soon routed; and the <hi>Ammonites</hi> seeing their Friends defeated, betook themselves to flight likewise.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Syrians,</hi> desirous to avenge this their shameful Defeat upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> assembled a vast <hi>Army,</hi> against which <hi>David</hi> marched in Person, at the Head of all his <hi>Forces,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated them a second time, killing no less than 40000 of their <hi>Foot,</hi> besides the Men that were in 700 of their <hi>Chariots.</hi> Upon this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, the <hi>Syrians</hi> fear'd to assist the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi> any more, and all neighbouring <hi>Princes</hi> began to stand in awe of <hi>David,</hi> who became every day more and more formidable, to all the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> that were about him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> History <hi>of the unadvisedness of</hi> Hanun, <hi>King of the</hi> Ammonites, <hi>shews us very lively, how unhappy those</hi> Princes <hi>are, that are led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side by Evil Counsel, the whole ruin of his</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>being here occasioned by his indiscreet Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and inconsiderate listning to the false Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of his</hi> Lords.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Neither is this the first or only Instance, that the safety or ruin of a State oft depends on good or bad Counsel; and that</hi> Prince <hi>is happy indeed, who being himself the Sovereign Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Kingdom, is so wise to discern who are fit to be his Counsellors, and the Instruments of his Royal Power and Authority, that he may not ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine himself by the Counsel or ill Administration of his Officers.</hi>

                           <hi>David</hi> from the Roof of his House seeing <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Uriah,</hi> bathing her self, conceives an unlawful Lust for her, and causes <hi>Uriah</hi> to be slain.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>DAVID</hi> now enjoying a profound <hi>Peace,</hi> after the great Defeat he had given to the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> their Allies,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2969. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1035.

                        </note> sent <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> at the Head of his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> to make an Inroad up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> to waste and spoil their <hi>Country,</hi> who having besieged <hi>Rabbah,</hi> the Capital City of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> soon after took it and destroy'd it, and sent the Crown of the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> which weighed a Talent of <hi>Gold,</hi> and was set with <hi>precious Stones.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilst <hi>Joab</hi> was thus employ'd abroad, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> took his repose and enjoy'd himself at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi> and one day in the Evening, as he was walking on the Terrace of his <hi>Palace,</hi> he saw a <hi>Woman</hi> bathing her self, that was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fair and beautiful. <hi>David</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a <hi>Lust</hi> for her, sent to enquire who she was; and being told that she was <hi>Bathsheba</hi> the Wife of <hi>Uriah,</hi> he sent for her, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Adultery</hi> with her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bathsheba</hi> soon after finding her self with <hi>Child,</hi> and fearing lest her <hi>Husband's</hi> absence (who was in the <hi>Army</hi> with <hi>Joab</hi>) would be a means to discover her <hi>Adultery,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expose her to the Capital Punishment the <hi>Law</hi> ordained for <hi>Women</hi> guilty of that Crime, sent and acquainted <hi>David,</hi> that she was with <hi>Child,</hi> and the Fears she had justly conceived thereupon. <hi>David</hi> (upon this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) sends Word to <hi>Joab,</hi> the General of his <hi>Army</hi>) to send <hi>Uriah</hi> to him; who (when he was come) <hi>David</hi> askt him several Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the state of the War, and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress they had made in the Siege of <hi>Rabbah,</hi> the Metropolis of the <hi>Ammonites?</hi> and then wish'd him to go home and refresh himself for a season. But <hi>Uriah</hi> instead of following the <hi>King's</hi> Advice, and going to his House, lodged that Night with the <hi>King's Guards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next day, when <hi>David</hi> understood that <hi>Uriah</hi> was not gone to his House, he sent for him, and demanded of him, why he did not go home? who very generously answer'd <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> with these remarkable Words: <hi>The</hi> Ark <hi>of the</hi> Lord, <hi>and</hi> all Israel <hi>and</hi> Judah, <hi>and my Lord</hi> Joab, <hi>and the</hi> Servants <hi>of my Lord are encamped in the open Fields; Shall I then go to my House to eat and to drink, and to lye with my Wife? As thou livest I will not do this thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> seeing his Design thus frustrated by <hi>Uriah's</hi> Courage and Greatness of <hi>Soul,</hi> and that he was not to be removed from the noble Resolution he had taken by any Temptations of <hi>Rest</hi> or <hi>Pleasure</hi> whatsoever; and seeing <hi>Bathsheba</hi> exposed to the shame and hazard of her Crime divulged; he in these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances form'd a Resolution very different and opposite to that sweetness of Temper, which till then had always appeared so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him; and by <hi>Uriah</hi> sent Letters to <hi>Joab,</hi> with Orders to post him in such a Quarter against the <hi>City,</hi> where he might be most expos'd to danger; and in case of a <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to retire from him, that he might fall by the hand of the <hi>Ammonites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joab</hi> (in obedience to these Orders of the <hi>King</hi>) appointed <hi>Uriah's</hi> Post against a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>City</hi> where he knew valiant Men were, where, upon the first <hi>Sally</hi> they made, he was slain, with some others of the <hi>Army. Joab</hi> sent the news of <hi>Uriah's</hi> death to <hi>David,</hi> who seem'd little concern'd at the loss of so couragious and faithful a <hi>Servant,</hi> whose Death he was the principal Cause of. <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba</hi> being inform'd of her <hi>Husbands</hi> Death, mourned for him; and when the days of her <hi>Mourning</hi> were accomplished, <hi>David</hi> sent for her, and she became his <hi>Wife.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This double Crime of so great and glorious a Saint, as</hi> David <hi>was, makes it appear, That</hi> Men, <hi>how great or Righteous soever they may be, are still but</hi> Men, <hi>and retain always some part of the frailty and weakness of the</hi> Clay <hi>from whence they were taken and formed at first.

                           <hi>GOD</hi> sends <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet to <hi>David,</hi> to represent his <hi>Sin</hi> to him, and denounce <hi>God's Judgments</hi> against him. <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth his <hi>Sin,</hi> and humbles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self before <hi>GOD.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>DAVID</hi> having committed these two great <hi>Crimes,</hi> made it appear, by the small care he took to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise again from his Fall,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2970. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1034.</note> with what thick darkness <hi>Sin</hi> overcasts and clouds the <hi>Souls</hi> of the greatest Saints. He continued in <hi>Peace</hi> for a whole year, under the guilt of these horrid <hi>Sins,</hi> if so be <hi>Peace</hi> may be said to be the Inmate of an <hi>Heart,</hi> which hath in so high and exorbitant a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner offended GOD.</p>
                     <p>Whilst <hi>David</hi> was thus forgetful of GOD and himself, GOD took pity of him, and sent <hi>Nathan</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> to him to open his <hi>Eyes,</hi> to lay his <hi>Sin</hi> before him, and to search his <hi>Wound</hi> to the quick, of which he had seem'd for so long a time altogether insensible. This <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> being charg'd by GOD himself with this troublesom and hazardous <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> shews us (by his dextrous manner of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to him on this occasion) with how much Wisdom and Prudence Men of <hi>David</hi>'s Rank ought to be reproved, for fear of offending them, and raising their Anger by too severe and keen Expressions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nathan,</hi> in pursuance of the <hi>Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> makes use of a <hi>Parable</hi> of a rich Man, who having many <hi>Sheep,</hi> robb'd a poor Man of an <hi>Ewe-Lamb,</hi> which he had bought, and nourish'd up, and tenderly lov'd, as having no more but that one; and taking it from him by force, dressed it, to accommodate a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that was come to visit him, when as he might easily have furnish'd himself from his own <hi>Flocks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David,</hi> how blind soever he might be with respect to his own <hi>Guilt,</hi> was very clear-sighted in a Case which he thought did not concern him; and his Anger being kindled against the horrid Injustice of the Rich Man, he (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to himself) pronounc'd his own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and confirm'd it with an Oath, saying, <hi>As the</hi> LORD <hi>liveth, the Man that hath done this thing shall surely die.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Nathan</hi> laying aside the disguise of his <hi>Parable,</hi> told him with a gravity and earnestness becoming his Person, that he himself was the <hi>Man;</hi> and in the Name of the LORD represented to him all the multiplied Benefits GOD had heap'd upon him, and the <hi>Enemies, Perils,</hi> and <hi>Distresses</hi> he had deliver'd him from. He laid before him, in what an outragious a manner he had affronted the Divine Bounty and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence towards him, by recompencing so many Graces and Favours with extream In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and forgetfulness of his Duty to his great Benefactor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> at this Remonstrance turning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and there taking a view of the heinous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Offence, was not exasperated at the Truths <hi>Nathan</hi> had represented to him, notwithstanding that they condemn'd him, and expos'd him as a notorious Criminal. He was not incens'd at the <hi>Prophet,</hi> who held this <hi>Looking-glass</hi> before him, which instead of flattering him, shew'd him all his hidden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities. He did not question him, how he who was but a <hi>Subject,</hi> durst undertake to talk at this rate to his <hi>Sovereign,</hi> but seem'd for this time to have forgot that he was <hi>King,</hi> that he might the better remember that he was a <hi>Sinner.</hi> Instead of flying out in a Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the <hi>Prophet,</hi> he humbles himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD and him, and cries out, <hi>I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against the</hi> LORD, which Words were the mark of a more sincere Repentance in him, than they were in <hi>Saul,</hi> or than they are at this day in many <hi>Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He embraced with an humble submission all the terrible Denunciations</hi> Nathan (<hi>in the</hi> Name <hi>of</hi> GOD) <hi>thunder'd out against him, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that long series of Disasters by</hi> GOD's <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice entail'd on his Family, as a means</hi> GOD <hi>in mercy would make use of, to satisfie his Justice and appease his Anger; and with bitter regret and extream sorrow taking a view of the State from whence he had precipitated himself, he cast himself down in the deepest humility before</hi> GOD, <hi>yet did not despair of his Mercy (as</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observes) <hi>who upon this occasion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires</hi> David's <hi>great Courage and Confidence in</hi> GOD: <hi>but as soon as he was made sensible of his loss, he without further troubling himself, endeavour'd to repair it with the assistance of the</hi> Divine Grace, <hi>by a</hi> Repentance <hi>which lasted as long as his Life: and which made St.</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose <hi>to say, That there are many who imitate</hi> David <hi>in his</hi> Sins, <hi>but very few that follow him in his</hi> Humiliation, <hi>and continued course of</hi> Repentance.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Absalom</hi> causeth his Brother <hi>Amnon</hi> to be slain at a <hi>Feast,</hi> for ravishing his <hi>Sister. Absalom</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels against his Father <hi>David,</hi> and forces him to flee from <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

                     <p>GOD having brought <hi>David</hi> to a serious reflection upon his <hi>Sin,</hi> and earnest Repentance for it by means of the Remonstrance made to him in his Name by <hi>Nathan</hi> the <hi>Prophet,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2972. <hi>before Christ,</hi> 1032.</note> he made it appear by his dealing with him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that the greatest Favour can be shew'd to <hi>Sinners,</hi> is not to indulge or spare them. For first of all, he struck with Death the <hi>Child,</hi> that was the Fruit of his <hi>Adultery;</hi> neither could <hi>David's Tears</hi> and <hi>Fasting</hi> repeal the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence GOD had past. His Son <hi>Amnon</hi> soon after ravishes his Sister <hi>Tamar;</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom</hi> provok'd with this Outrage committed against his Sister, resolv'd to kill <hi>Amnon.</hi> He waited two whole years for a convenient oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to do it; and then inviting all the <hi>King's Sons</hi> to a Feast, in the midst of their Mirth and Jollity, caused his <hi>Servants</hi> to fall upon <hi>Amnon,</hi> and murther him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Absalom</hi> being fain to flee, and leave the Court upon this Murther of his <hi>Brother,</hi> retir'd to the King of <hi>Geshur;</hi> but <hi>Joab</hi> perceiving that the <hi>King</hi> had an inclination for <hi>Absalom's</hi> return to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he order'd it so, that about three years after he became reconciled to his <hi>Father.</hi> But the recalling of the <hi>Son,</hi> was like to have prov'd the ruin of the <hi>Father:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2979.</note> For no sooner did this ungrateful and graceless <hi>Son</hi> see himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to his <hi>Father's</hi> Favour; but he began to form Designs against his <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this end <hi>Absalom</hi> made it his business to inveigle the Affections and good Will of the <hi>People,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2981.</note> and that none should have reason to complain of him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus for four years together labour'd to make himself popular, and draw a Party after him, he desir'd leave of King <hi>David</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go to <hi>Hebron,</hi> upon pretence of paying a Vow he had made unto the <hi>LORD,</hi> during his Exile from the <hi>Court</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Absalom</hi> having obtain'd his <hi>Father's</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, hasted to <hi>Hebron,</hi> where he immediately caused himself to be proclaimed <hi>King.

                     <p>In this condition, he, with a strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Humility, bore all the railing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Curses of <hi>Shimei,</hi> who flung <hi>Stones</hi> at him and his <hi>Officers</hi> as he passed by; for looking upon this Rebellion of his <hi>Subject</hi> as a <hi>Looking-glass,</hi> which reflected the Image of his own Apostacy, he meekly accepted of his outragious Language as an effect of the <hi>Divine Justice,</hi> and receiv'd all his railing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions with the same submission, as if <hi>GOD</hi> had given a special Command to <hi>Shimei</hi> thus to curse and revile him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Absalom,</hi> in the mean time, having made his triumphant Entry into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> began his <hi>Usurpation</hi> (according to the Counsel of <hi>Achitophel</hi> and <hi>Nathan's</hi> Prediction to <hi>David</hi>) with violating his Father's <hi>Concubines</hi> in the Face of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus</hi> David <hi>learnt by sad Experience, that when</hi> Man <hi>rebels against GOD, all other</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>rebel against him, to revenge the Affront done to the</hi> Divine Majesty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>and saw his Crime punished by those horrid disorders in his Family; by the ravishing of</hi> Tamar; <hi>by the murther of</hi> Amnon; <hi>by the Rebellion of his dearest Son</hi> Absalom; <hi>by his</hi> Friends <hi>leaving him, and his</hi> Subjects <hi>rebelling against him; by the railing and high Abuses of</hi> Shimei; <hi>and lastly, by the imminent danger of</hi> Death, <hi>for the escaping of which he was fain to expose himself to a shameful</hi> Flight, <hi>accompanied with so many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, that nothing less than the</hi> Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, <hi>and the hopes of seeing him at last ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased by all those Evils he groaned under, could have enabled him to endure them.</hi>

                     <p>This <hi>Counsel</hi> of <hi>Hushai</hi> prevailed, which did so provoke and vex <hi>Achitophel,</hi> that going home he hanged himself. <hi>Hushai</hi> in the mean time inform'd <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> of what had past in <hi>Council,</hi> and wished them (by some means or other) to send word to <hi>David,</hi> to pass the <hi>River Jordan,</hi> lest he should be set upon by the Enemy at unawares. <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted herewith, passed over <hi>Jordan,</hi> he and all the Forces that were with him that Night, before break of Day, and having got together all the Forces he could, prepared himself for a <hi>Fight,</hi> being resolv'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Army</hi> himself, but his great <hi>Officers</hi> would not suffer it; and before he retired, he gave a strait Charge to <hi>Joab,</hi> and his other general <hi>Officers</hi> to spare <hi>Absalom.</hi>

                     <p>Both the <hi>Armies</hi> being at last engaged, that of <hi>Absalom</hi> was beaten, notwithstanding it was much superiour in number to that of <hi>David,</hi> and above 20000 of his <hi>Men</hi> kill'd. <hi>Absalom</hi> seeing the Day was lost for him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to save himself by flight; but riding on his <hi>Mule</hi> under an <hi>Oak,</hi> his prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Head of <hi>Hair</hi> caught hold of, and entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the <hi>Boughs</hi> of it, and the <hi>Mule</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its course, left him hanging thereon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joab</hi> being inform'd thereof by a Person, who had seen him hanging in that posture, was angry with him, that he had not kill'd <hi>Absalom;</hi> and finding all about him backward to this Service, for fear of incurring the <hi>King's</hi> displeasure, who in the hearing of them all had charged his <hi>Generals</hi> to spare the <hi>young Man,</hi> he went himself to the place, and stuck him with 3 <hi>Darts</hi> through the <hi>Heart,</hi> as he was yet hanging alive on the <hi>Tree,</hi> and then immediately caused a Retreat to be sounded, to prevent any farther effusion of Blood.</p>
                     <p>The news of the success of the <hi>Battel,</hi> and of <hi>Absalom</hi>'s Death, was immediately brought to <hi>David,</hi> who was not concern'd for any thing so much as the Life of his dear <hi>Son;</hi> and being at length told, that he was dead, he chang'd the Joy of his <hi>Victory</hi> into Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Mourning. But <hi>Joab</hi> being greatly offended, that the <hi>King</hi> seem'd so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the Service he had done him, in keeping the <hi>Crown</hi> upon his <hi>Head,</hi> reproach'd him with a great deal of liberty, for that he loved his <hi>Enemies</hi> more than his <hi>Friends,</hi> and those that hated him and sought his <hi>Life,</hi> more than those that had hazarded their <hi>Lives,</hi> and all that was near and dear to them, to save it; and threatned him, that except he would come and shew himself to the <hi>People,</hi> and speak kindly to them, in acknowledgment of the great and inestimahle Service they had done for him, that before the next <hi>Light</hi> he should find himself abandon'd and forsaken of all, and plunge himself into a worse Mishap than ever yet had befallen him.</p>
                     <p>Upon this sharp Remonstrance of <hi>Joab David</hi> shewed himself to the <hi>People,</hi> tho' his Grief for <hi>Absalom</hi> still continued. <hi>In which Carriage of his, he was a great Example to all</hi> Ghostly Fathers, <hi>to represent to them, how far their Love towards their</hi> Spiritual Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>ought to carry them.</hi> David <hi>here forgets all the horrid Outrages his</hi> Son <hi>had committed against him, and remembers only that he was his</hi> Son, <hi>and that he was dead not only corporally, but spiritually also.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Shimei,</hi> who had so highly affronted and abused the <hi>Majesty</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> by his <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Carriage,</hi> being sensible what his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would draw down upon him, came and cast himself at <hi>David</hi>'s Feet, accusing and condemning himself; and when <hi>Abishai (Joab's</hi> Brother) could not well bear the <hi>King's</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doningso great a Crime, to so wicked and profligate a Person, and desired leave to kill him, because he had cursed the <hi>King; David</hi> told him, that he would not sully the Victory GOD had given him, with the <hi>Blood</hi> of any one Person.</p>
                     <p>At the same time also <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jonathan</hi> came to meet. <hi>David,</hi> to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his Victory; and when <hi>David</hi> asked him, Why he did not come to him during <hi>Absalom's Rebellion?</hi> he represented to him, how unworthily <hi>Ziba</hi> his Servant had dealt with him, in slandering him before the <hi>King,</hi> and persuading him, that he staid at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> in hopes of attaining (by means of that Commotion) the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Israel;</hi> whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he had been so far from any such <hi>thoughts,</hi> and his <hi>concern</hi> had been so great for the <hi>Kings</hi> Safety, that he had neither trimmed his <hi>Beard,</hi> nor washed his <hi>Cloaths,</hi> from the day the <hi>King</hi> departed, till he came again in Peace.</p>
                     <p>And yet <hi>David</hi> had so far given credit to this false Accusation of <hi>Ziba,</hi> that he had bestow'd upon him all his <hi>Master's Estate;</hi> but that which is yet more surprizing in this <hi>holy King</hi> is, that after he had heard how <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosheth</hi> justified himself, and manifested <hi>Ziba's</hi> Imposture and Calumny, he contented himself with only restoring to <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> the Moiety of his <hi>Estate,</hi> leaving the other half in the possession of this Impostor and Betrayer of his <hi>Master.</hi>

                     <head>The Iudgment of the Plague.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>David</hi> having caused his <hi>People</hi> to be numbered, by a motion of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity,</hi> GOD afflicts his <hi>Kingdom</hi> with a <hi>Plague,</hi> which in three Days time took away <hi>70000</hi> of his <hi>Subjects.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>DAVID</hi> had scarce taken breath since the manifold Troubles, GOD had in several ways excited to him in his own <hi>Family,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2978. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1016. David <hi>being then</hi> 68 <hi>years of Age.</hi>
                        </note> as well as in his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to punish him for the <hi>Sin</hi> he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, when the Repose he began to enjoy became the cause of his falling into new ones, and thereby became a teaching Instance of this great Truth, <hi>That a</hi> Man, <hi>how righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous soever he may be, is but still a</hi> Man; <hi>and after all, continues to lie open to fresh Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and new Falls.</hi> His first <hi>Sin,</hi> was his being overcome by carnal <hi>Lust;</hi> but now he was seduced by his <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity,</hi> which is an Inclination that ought to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>always fear'd by the most perfect, as being a Passion that most intimately cleaves to Man's Nature.</p>
                     <p>'Twas this corrupt Affection prompted <hi>David</hi> to take an exact account of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his <hi>People,</hi> that from thence he might make an estimate of his <hi>Grandeur</hi> and <hi>Power. Joab</hi> and the rest of his <hi>Officers,</hi> seem'd very backward and opposite to this his <hi>design,</hi> and told him, that they begg'd of <hi>GOD,</hi> that he would increase and multiply his <hi>Subjects,</hi> but did not see any necessity of taking the exact number of them. But <hi>David</hi> being resolved upon the Point, would be obeyed. So <hi>Joab</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Officers</hi> departed to execute the <hi>King's Orders,</hi> and were ten Months in taking an account of all the People of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> and when they had cast up their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and brought them to <hi>David,</hi> there were found 1300000 valiant Men, bearing <hi>Arms</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi> and 500000 of the like Men in <hi>Judah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>David</hi> being check'd in his <hi>Conscience</hi> for this Undertaking, humbly confessed his <hi>Sin</hi> before the <hi>LORD,</hi> declaring, that he had done <hi>very foolishly,</hi> and beseeching him to take away his <hi>Iniquity.</hi> Whilst <hi>David</hi> was engaged in <hi>humbling</hi> himself before the <hi>LORD,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring his Grace and Pardon, GOD sent the Prophet <hi>Gad</hi> unto him; not to bring his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but to give him his choice of three sorts of Punishments, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether 7 years of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> should afflict his <hi>Land;</hi> or whether he would be expos'd to <hi>Wars</hi> for three Months, wherein he should continually be worsted; or to suffer a <hi>Pestilence</hi> of three Days?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> having heard his Sentence from the Mouth of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> declared, that he was in a great streight about the Choice he had to make; because tho' he made his Choice never so well, it would still occasion much Mischief and Misery; but however desired, that he might fall into the hand of the <hi>LORD,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than into the Hands of <hi>Men,</hi> because his Mercies were great. Thus having made choice of the <hi>Pestilence</hi> for three Days to infest his <hi>Country; GOD</hi> gave his Commission to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Angel,</hi> who smote 70000 <hi>Men</hi> with the <hi>Plague,</hi> that they died within the prefixed time, in the compass of his <hi>Dominions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David's</hi> Behaviour (during this affliction of the <hi>Plague</hi>) was a great Example for <hi>Kings,</hi> teaching them, how great Tenderness and Compassion they ought to have for their <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Subjects:</hi> And as it may serve as a Lesson for them, so also it is a good Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> how they ought to offer up themselves as <hi>Victims</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>People.</hi> For this good <hi>Prince</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering himself as the sole Cause of the dreadful <hi>Affliction</hi> which at that time devour'd his <hi>People,</hi> cried earnestly to GOD in their behalf, saying, <hi>I have sinned,</hi> O LORD, <hi>and done wickedly; but as for these Sheep, what have they done? Turn rather thine Anger against me, and against my Father's House, who am the cause of it, whereas they are innocent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this Prayer and Humiliation of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> GOD sent the Prophet <hi>Gad</hi> a second time to him, commanding him to erect an <hi>Altar</hi> unto the LORD in the Threshing-floor of <hi>Araunah</hi> the <hi>Jebusite,</hi> where he had seen the <hi>destroying Angel</hi> smiting the <hi>People. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> immediately obey'd this Divine Order; and having offered there <hi>Burnt-Offerings</hi> and <hi>Peace-Offerings,</hi> GOD was entreated, and the <hi>Plague</hi> was stayed.</p>
                     <p>GOD <hi>made it appear by this Instance,</hi> (as the <hi>Fathers</hi> observe) <hi>That as he often</hi> plagues <hi>a People for the</hi> Sins <hi>of the</hi> Rulers; <hi>so he often turns away his Fury from them, and becomes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd, when their</hi> Pastors <hi>and</hi> Governours <hi>stand in the Gap, and become Intercessors for them.</hi>

                  <head>The CONTENTS of the first Book of the KINGS, commonly called the third Book of KINGS.</head>
                  <p>IN this and the following <hi>Book</hi> is set forth the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>KINGS,</hi> who governed the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> from <hi>David</hi> until the time of the <hi>Babylonish Captivity;</hi> for which reason they are called the First and Second <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Kings.</hi> The former of these begins with a relation of the <hi>Sickness</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of King <hi>David,</hi> and the Succession of his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> to the <hi>Throne,</hi> who after he had received the good and holy Instructions and Admonitions of his <hi>Father,</hi> concerning his wise Conduct in administring and setling the <hi>Affairs</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that thereby he might establish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the <hi>Throne,</hi> and secure it to himself and Posterity; and over and above had been honoured by <hi>GOD,</hi> with an immediate mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation and revelation of himself, he was in an extraordinary manner blessed by <hi>GOD,</hi> with the Gifts of <hi>Wisdom, Riches,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and in his Country with <hi>Peace, Trade,</hi> and all manner of Abundance and Affluence. And now (after that he had order'd all things relating to his <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Family</hi>) he built and dedicated a Magnificent <hi>Temple</hi> to the LORD, besides some other <hi>Royal Edifices.</hi> All which effects of his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and great <hi>Riches</hi> rais'd him so high a Renown (both far and near,) that the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Sheba</hi> came to visit him in great Pomp and State, and all his Neighbouring <hi>Princes,</hi> sent their <hi>Ambassadors</hi> to him with rich <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,</hi> and proffers of Friendship and Alliance. Yet notwithstanding all these <hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> he had received from the Hand of GOD, he suffer'd himself to be corrupted and seduced to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> by the many strange <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Concubines,</hi> he had taken to himself; by which means the LORD being provoked against him, raised him up <hi>Enemies,</hi> and by the Prophet <hi>Ahijah</hi> denounced to him the rending and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Rent</hi> accordingly hapned, when his Son <hi>Rehoboam</hi> (by ill and unadvised <hi>Counsel</hi>) alienated the ten <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> from him, who chose <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat</hi> to be their King; <hi>Rehoboam</hi> retaining only his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> over the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> and part of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Benjamin;</hi> being expresly forbid by the <hi>LORD,</hi> to endeavour the reduction of the said ten <hi>Tribes</hi> to his Obedience by force of <hi>Arms,</hi> as he had intended to do. Moreover, because of his <hi>Sins,</hi> and of the <hi>Sins</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was pillaged by <hi>Shishak</hi> King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> His Son <hi>Abiam</hi> after his Death succeeds him in the <hi>Throne,</hi> and imitates his <hi>Vices</hi> and <hi>Sins.</hi> But <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> being good and religious <hi>Princes,</hi> reform and re-establish the Worship of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Kings,</hi> who after the division of the two <hi>Kingdoms</hi> Reigned over <hi>Israel,</hi> and whose <hi>Histories</hi> are related in this <hi>Book,</hi> they were all <hi>Idolaters</hi> and corrupted the true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> by divers Abominations: For <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> besides his setting up of the <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> in a manner totally changed the outward order and way of <hi>Worship,</hi> and instituted <hi>Priests</hi> of his own, that were not of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Levi,</hi> but of the Scum of the <hi>People;</hi> and by this means were the ten <hi>Tribes</hi> turn'd from the true Worship of <hi>GOD,</hi> to <hi>Idolatry.</hi> His Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors followed his steps, and in particular <hi>Ahab;</hi> for besides his <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in which he out-did all his <hi>Predecessors,</hi> he exercised a tyrannical and cruel Persecution against those few good <hi>Men</hi> which feared <hi>GOD,</hi> that were left among his <hi>Subjects.</hi> And for this Reason it was, that the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in one <hi>Race,</hi> but past frequently from one <hi>Family</hi> to another, not without great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and Blood-shed. And tho' <hi>GOD</hi> was not wanting to send his Prophets <hi>Ahijah, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiah, Iddo Azariah, Jehu Hanani, Elijah</hi> and <hi>Micaiah,</hi> to the revolted <hi>Israelites,</hi> to exhort them to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and to return from their <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Apostasie;</hi> yet for all this they still went on in their <hi>Sins,</hi> notwithstanding that the foresaid <hi>Prophets</hi> frequently confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their <hi>Divine Call,</hi> by great and stupendous <hi>Miracles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The pure <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and true <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,</hi> were somewhat better rooted in <hi>Judah,</hi> because there the good <hi>Kings</hi> put their hands to this Work, together with the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and with a great deal of fervour and Zeal endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd a Reformation. So that in this <hi>Book</hi> we have a very lively representation of the mutability of the outward state and condition of the <hi>Visible Church</hi> in this World, as well as of the stedfastness and unchangableness of the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> towards his own, tho' many times unknown and hid from the eyes of <hi>Men.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>DAvid</hi>'s Age and approaching Death, gave occasion to his <hi>Sons</hi> to contend about the <hi>Succession,</hi> by the ambition they had of rising to the <hi>Royal Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2989. <hi>and before Christ</hi> 1015. David <hi>being then</hi> 70 <hi>years of Age, and</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon 18.</note> but whilst all were in suspence, to know who would be the new <hi>King, Adonijah,</hi> his eldest <hi>Son, (Absalom</hi>'s younger Brother) being impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to wear a <hi>Crown,</hi> made a great Feast, to which he invited <hi>Joab</hi> and other <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> whom he had gain'd to be of his Party; with intention, that after the Feast they should proclaim him <hi>King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Day appointed for this Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy was come, <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet being inform'd of the whole Matter, and who knew that (according to the <hi>Divine Oracle) Solomon</hi> was to succeed his Father <hi>David,</hi> went to <hi>Bathsheba, Solomons</hi> Mother, and advis'd her to go to the <hi>King,</hi> and acquaint him with <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijahs</hi> Conspiracy, and to put him in mind of his Promise, to make <hi>Solomon</hi> his Successor. <hi>Bathsheba</hi> followed <hi>Nathans</hi> Counsel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented these things to King <hi>David;</hi> and whilst she was yet speaking, <hi>Nathan</hi> came in also, and presenting himself before the <hi>King,</hi> he enquir'd of him, whether it were with his Consent and Allowance, that some of his <hi>Subjects</hi> had declar'd <hi>Adonijah</hi> King?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> seem'd much surpriz'd at these Tidings, and not thinking it fit to delay the time, order'd <hi>Nathan</hi> the <hi>Prophet,</hi> to take some of his <hi>High Officers</hi> along with him, and to Anoint and Proclaim his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> King. Which being accordingly performed, and the Report of it spread abroad through the <hi>City,</hi> all those who had taken part with <hi>Adonijah,</hi> were fain to flee for it; and <hi>Adonijah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self apprehending <hi>Solomons</hi> Anger, went and laid hold of the Horns of the <hi>Altar,</hi> in order to save his life; the news of which being brought to <hi>Solomon,</hi> he promised to pardon him, in case of his good Behaviour for the future.</p>
                     <p>About some six Months after this, GOD called <hi>David</hi> out of this World, after he had given to his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> good Counsel and necessary Instructions, how to behave himself in the <hi>Government,</hi> and communicated to him some private Orders, which he would have him to execute after his Death. <hi>Adonijah</hi> soon after his <hi>Fathers</hi> Decease, moved <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba,</hi> to sue King <hi>Solomon</hi> on his behalf for <hi>Abishag,</hi> that he might marry her. This <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shag</hi> was a beautiful <hi>Virgin,</hi> that cherished and attended King <hi>David</hi> towards his latter end, when his Natural heat began to fail him, so that they could not keep wramth in him: But <hi>Solomon</hi> smelling an ambitious design in this Suit of <hi>Adonijah,</hi> caus'd him to be slain. In like manner he also served <hi>Joab</hi> his <hi>Fathers General,</hi> according to the Command he had given him. <hi>Shimei</hi> also, who had so unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donably affronted and abused his Father <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> in the time of his Flight from <hi>Absalom,</hi> was fain to submit to the same fate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> being thus happily established on the <hi>Throne,</hi> made an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 2991. <hi>before</hi> Christ 1013. <hi>being the</hi> 20 <hi>year of</hi> Solomons <hi>Age, and the</hi> 3d <hi>of his Reign.</hi>
                        </note> and married his <hi>Daughter.</hi> Some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>GOD</hi> appeared to him in a Dream in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> where he had been offering 1000 <hi>Burnt Sacrifices,</hi> and bade him ask what he would of him. <hi>Solomon</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was <hi>King</hi> over a great <hi>People,</hi> and that Sovereign Power could not well be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd without an extraordinary share of <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and that the greater his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was, the stronger his Obligation was to great and excellent Actions, though there was nothing he stood so much in need of as <hi>Wisdom,</hi> whereby he might be enabled to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his <hi>Subjects</hi> well and happily, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made that alone his Petition of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The LORD was so well pleased with this his Request, which shewed him already in a great measure possest of what he had beg'd of him, that he promised to bestow such a measure of it upon him, as never any <hi>Man</hi> had enjoy'd before him, or ever should have after him: And forasmuch as he had not asked either <hi>Riches</hi> or <hi>Honour,</hi> which he seemed to undervalue in comparison of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> he would as a Surplus give him so great a share of them, both as never any <hi>King</hi> had had before him, or any should be able to boast of after him.</p>

The other <hi>Woman</hi> strongly deny'd all that she had alledg'd, to prove, that the <hi>living Child</hi> was hers; and strongly asserted, that the <hi>dead Child</hi> she had found in her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, was indeed her own <hi>Child.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This intricate Case, which had hapned without Proof or Witness in a Lone-house, wherein there was no other Company, but the <hi>Parties</hi> concern'd, and in the dead-time of the Night, did indeed require a Head like <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> to discuss and decide it; who upon this occasion gave a convincing <hi>Proof</hi> of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge of Nature he was endow'd with, as not only understanding the virtues and powers of <hi>Plants, Trees,</hi> and <hi>Animals,</hi> but also the most secret propensities and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Heart of <hi>Man,</hi> and amongst the rest, the tender affections and bowels of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> towards their <hi>Children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For <hi>Solomon</hi> having heard the <hi>Plea</hi> of them both, commanded a <hi>Sword</hi> to be brought him, and pronounced this Sentence, which at first sight seem'd very strange and unjust, <hi>One of you</hi> (said <hi>Solomon) saith, The living Son is mine, and thy</hi> Child <hi>is dead, and the other saith, Not so, but thy Son is dead, and mine is living: Wherefore divide the</hi> living Child, <hi>and give the one half to the one, and the other half to the other.</hi> The true <hi>Mother</hi> having heard the <hi>King</hi> pronounce this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, her bowels being moved and yerning for her <hi>Son,</hi> earnestly entreated the <hi>King,</hi> by no means to kill the innocent <hi>Babe,</hi> but rather give it to her who falsly pretended to it, and had robb'd her of it: But the false <hi>Mother</hi> approved the Equity of the Sentence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, that since they could not agree about the <hi>Child,</hi> it might be divided, and each have half, since both could not have the whole.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> had no sooner heard their different reflections upon the <hi>Sentence</hi> he had given, but he adjudged the <hi>living Child</hi> to be given to her, who (by her desire and earnestness to save the <hi>Childs Life</hi>) had given an incontesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proof, that it was her own, her <hi>Motherly</hi> bowels and affection evincing it beyond a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of doubting. Thus by <hi>Solomons</hi> great Sagacity and Wisdom was the true <hi>Mother</hi> discover'd, this difficult Case decided, and the Matter that had been so secretly handled without any Witnesses, laid open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the view of all <hi>Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this means <hi>Solomon</hi> evinc'd the truth of what he himself saith in his <hi>Proverbs, That a</hi> King <hi>seated on his Throne of Judgment, has in some measure the Spirit of</hi> Divination <hi>on his Lips, and that it is a very difficult thing to impose upon his Prudence and great Sagacity, as having the clearness of sight, to discern between</hi> Truth <hi>and</hi> Lies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Fathers take notice, that these two</hi> Women <hi>do excellently represent the difference there is between the true and false</hi> Pastors <hi>of the</hi> Church: <hi>The false</hi> Pastors <hi>accused the true one of killing and destroying the</hi> Souls <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Charge; whereas indeed they themselves are they that murther them; and make use of this Imposture, to sow Divisions and Dissensions in the</hi> Church: <hi>But the true</hi> Pastors <hi>(on the contrary) verifie themselves to be such by the Motherly Bowels they have for their</hi> Spiritual Children; <hi>they desire only their Salvation, and not at all their own Glory, and will rather suffer others to snatch from them the Souls they have nourished with the word of</hi> Life, <hi>than to give the least occasion of dividing the Unity of the</hi> Church.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>City,</hi> which in <hi>David</hi>'s time was the place of publick Worship, the Seat of the <hi>Kings,</hi> and the Metropolis of the whole <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> was first built by <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> that is, <hi>King of Righteousness,</hi> (for so the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies) <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> and contemporary with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and call'd <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, <hi>Peace;</hi> both Names suiting well together, since in all human Societies, <hi>Peace</hi> can't be maintain'd but by <hi>Justice,</hi> nor <hi>Justice</hi> be ever better exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted than in the time of <hi>Peace.</hi> But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards possest by the <hi>Jebusites,</hi> they from their Ancestors gave it the Name of <hi>Jebus,</hi> from <hi>Jebus</hi> one of the Sons of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham</hi> or <hi>Ham,</hi> and Grandchild of <hi>Noah;</hi> for when <hi>Cham</hi> passed over the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> with the <hi>Canaanites, Mitfraimites.</hi> and <hi>Phutites,</hi> all following towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereof <hi>Canaan</hi> dropt by the way, and seated in the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> and in this most pleasant and fertile <hi>Country,</hi> the numerous Off-spring of these prophane <hi>Canaanites</hi> overspread themselves, and severing it in parcels amongst their <hi>Tribes,</hi> gave Names thereunto according to their <hi>Father;</hi> yet the whole Country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Name of <hi>Canaan</hi> from their <hi>Grandsire.</hi> And here several of his Sons built <hi>Cities,</hi> amongst others, <hi>Jebus;</hi> which afterwards took the Name of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or <hi>Hierosolyma.</hi>

                     <p>This <hi>City</hi> was held by the <hi>Jebusites,</hi> and called <hi>Jebus</hi> by the space of 80 years, who fortified it in such sort, that when King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> made preparations to attack it, they gave out, that they would oppose his whole Forces only with their <hi>Blind, Lame,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit;</hi> but they were deceived in their Boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Imaginations, for King <hi>David</hi> van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd them, took the <hi>City,</hi> and drove out the <hi>Inhabitants;</hi> afterwards he repaired the <hi>Breaches,</hi> fortified the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi> and built round about from <hi>Millo</hi> inward, and named it as aforesaid by his own Name, 2 <hi>Sam. ch.</hi> 5. and made it the Capital <hi>City,</hi> not only of <hi>Judea,</hi> but of his whole <hi>Kingdom.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was governed by 21 <hi>Kings,</hi> and Queen <hi>Athaliah,</hi> for the space of 466 Years, 6 Months, and 10 Days, of which 390 years were from the Rebellion of the 10 <hi>Tribes</hi> unto the <hi>Captivity;</hi> and the 33 of <hi>David,</hi> the 40 of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the 6 Months of <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> were before the Rebellion, the 10 Days were the excess of one year, wherein the <hi>Sun</hi> went backwards in the days of <hi>Ahaz.</hi> And in this time <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was grown to that bigness, that it had no less than 150 Furlongs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, which is 18 ¾ <hi>English Miles,</hi> and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring above 150000 <hi>Inhabitants.</hi> But at the end of these years, in the Reign of <hi>Eliakim, Nebuchadnezzer</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> came, and utterly destroy'd both <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country, Kingdom</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> bound the <hi>King</hi> in brazen Chains, and carried him Prisoner into his own <hi>Country,</hi> with certain Vessels out of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and placed them in the House of his <hi>Gods</hi> at <hi>Babylon. Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jakim</hi> succeeding him, was 3 Months after also carried away captive by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> with the remainder of the rich Vessels of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and in the room of <hi>Jehojakim</hi> placed his Uncle <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> but he rebelling and defiling the <hi>Sanctuary of</hi> GOD, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his <hi>holy Prophets,</hi> and all the Instructions which they preach'd unto him in his Name, the King of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> returned the third time, took the <hi>City,</hi> destroyed the <hi>People,</hi> burnt the <hi>Temple,</hi> with all the sumptuous <hi>Buildings,</hi> and razed the <hi>Walls</hi> to the ground, carried away captive all the rest of the <hi>People</hi> (except a very few) and took out of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and out of the <hi>Kings Palace</hi> all that he could find remaining of the <hi>Vessels</hi> and <hi>Treasure.</hi> After all this yet held out <hi>Gedalia</hi> one part of a year as Vassal to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> but he was slain by <hi>Ismael;</hi> the remainder of the <hi>People</hi> fled away into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and carried <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> with them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 43. Then sang the <hi>Prophet</hi> this lamentable Song, <hi>Jer.</hi> Chap. 1.</p>
                     <p>Thus this miserable <hi>People</hi> remained Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and their Country ruin'd and lay uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and their <hi>City</hi> lay ruinate, the <hi>Walls</hi> being pulled down, and the <hi>Houses</hi> demolish'd, becoming the Habitation for <hi>Bats</hi> and <hi>Owls</hi> for the space of 70 years, until the Land had her fill of <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.21. During the 70 years Captivity at <hi>Babylon, Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> Reigned over these Coasts 25 years, <hi>Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merodach</hi> his Son 28 years, and <hi>Belshazzzar</hi> his Grandson 17 years, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.20.</p>
                     <p>At the end of the 14 years of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> came <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Median</hi> Prince, and laid Siege to <hi>Babylon</hi> for 3 years together; at the end of which was <hi>Belshazzar</hi> carrousing <hi>Wine</hi> with his <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> in the holy <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when the Hand-writing appear'd on the <hi>Wall,</hi> which made him tremble for fear, and the Night after <hi>Cyrus</hi> having drained the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> dry, the <hi>City</hi> was taken, and <hi>Belshazzar</hi> slain, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. And then Reigned <hi>Darius</hi> one year, and in that year it was that the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> set himself to seek the LORD by <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Fasting,</hi> for that he had understood by <hi>Books,</hi> that the 70 years were clean run out, in order that the <hi>People</hi> might be restored again to their <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and that the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>City</hi> might be rebuilt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. Immediately was this Prayer heard, and on the same year died King <hi>Darius,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> coming in his place, gave order for their Return out of <hi>Captivity,</hi> and accordingly the <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> Vessels of the <hi>Temple</hi> being delivered to <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> no time was lost with them, but immediately came away with great Acclamations of <hi>Joy.</hi>

                     <p>The 1<hi>st year</hi> they could do but little more than erect little <hi>Huts</hi> to lodge in, employing their time for the clearing and carrying away the <hi>Rubbish,</hi> for the laying the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Temple:</hi> The 2<hi>d year</hi> was also employed in Re-edifying the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the like was the 3<hi>d,</hi> until stopt by the Command of <hi>Cambyses,</hi> which lasted all his days, during these times the <hi>Jews</hi> built them <hi>Houses</hi> for their own dwelling, until reproved by the

Prophets <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachariah.</hi> In the 2<hi>d year</hi> of <hi>Darius</hi> (after the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Rebel was overthrown) they began again to build the <hi>Temple,</hi> and were so encouraged by the <hi>King,</hi> that in 5 <hi>years</hi> the <hi>inward Temple</hi> was finisht, and in 2 <hi>years</hi> more the <hi>Courts</hi> were compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After 49 <hi>years</hi> more was this <hi>City</hi> still more and more rising in Beauty and Honour, until she began to come to her former Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur; but yet she had not her <hi>Walls</hi> of strength until <hi>Artazerxes</hi> (King of <hi>Persia</hi>) permitted them, and to that purpose <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> came with Commission to see it done, and all was finish'd, and the <hi>Gates</hi> set up for its security and defence in 52 <hi>days,</hi> Neh. 6.15.</p>
                     <p>Thus did this <hi>City</hi> arise again to its splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and so continued until the coming of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> and during these times was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by <hi>Chief Rulers</hi> and <hi>High Priests,</hi> until the time came of the utter Subversion thereof.

And in the 2<hi>d year</hi> after this, was that second of <hi>Darius,</hi> when the building of the <hi>Temple</hi> went forward, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>In the days of <hi>Artaxerxes Ochus,</hi> there was one <hi>Bagoses,</hi> who was Lieutenant to the King of <hi>Persia</hi> in these Parts, who came to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with Threats; occasioned, for that <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> the <hi>High Priest,</hi> who had slain his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Manasseh,</hi> for Marrying a Daughter of <hi>Sanballat</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and contended with him for the <hi>Priesthood (Joseph.

Nehem.</hi> 13.28. but when <hi>Alexander</hi> had got the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>Sanballat</hi> got the start of the <hi>Jews,</hi> struck in with the Conqueror, and incensed him against them; but as <hi>Alexander</hi> lay before <hi>Gaza, Sanballat</hi> died before the <hi>Walls</hi> thereof, so that he had not the accomplishment of his ends; howbeit <hi>Alexander</hi> having master'd <hi>Gaza,</hi> came against <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in great wrath; but <hi>Jaddus</hi> (who was <hi>High Priest</hi> at that time) came out of the <hi>City</hi> in his <hi>Priestly Robes</hi> to meet him; and no sooner did <hi>Alexander</hi> see him, but his wrath was turned into Reverence, and doing him great Honour, left also noble Marks of his kindness behind him at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> But <hi>Alexander</hi> being dead, <hi>Ptolomeus Lagus,</hi> Lord of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was not so civil; for he coming upon them on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> (while they made no defence) took his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their <hi>Superstition,</hi> surpriz'd the <hi>City,</hi> made the <hi>Citizens</hi> his Captives, and carried away many of them Prisoners into <hi>Egypt:</hi> And thus it was an apt Prey unto whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Conqueror; sometimes the <hi>Syrians</hi> were their <hi>Lords,</hi> and otherwhiles the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> until the end that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> having van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd <hi>Antigonus,</hi> enjoyed all <hi>Palestine</hi> in Peace. After him <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus</hi> held it, who did the <hi>Jews</hi> much honour, and caused the famous Translation of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> into the <hi>Greek Tongue</hi> by the <hi>Septuagint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Antiochus,</hi> called the <hi>Great,</hi> disturbed <hi>Palestine</hi> with <hi>Wars</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Ptolomy Philopater,</hi> and subdued the whole <hi>Country,</hi> yet shewed kindness to the <hi>Jews;</hi> but the Son of this <hi>Antiochus</hi> (called <hi>Epiphanes</hi>) was a bloody Persecutor, who polluted the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of the Most High, took away the <hi>Daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and set up the <hi>Abomination of Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for the space of 2300 Days, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.31. Chap. 8.11, 12, 13, 14. and made havock of the <hi>People,</hi> killing and carrying them away <hi>Captives,</hi> and compelling them to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to <hi>Idols,</hi> until few of them were left.</p>
                     <p>These were bitter times amongst 'em, until <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi> and his Brethren, with a small help stood up and adventured their Lives for the Service of <hi>GOD,</hi> and did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, cleansing the <hi>Altar of GOD,</hi> and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Religion. This <hi>Judas</hi> spent his time in fighting the <hi>Battels</hi> of the <hi>LORD</hi> in which he was victorious; and after him <hi>Jonathan</hi> his Brother did the like, and became famous until he was murther'd by <hi>Tryphon:</hi> But <hi>Simon</hi> (another <hi>Brother</hi>) cast out the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from the <hi>Holy City,</hi> and restored <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the <hi>Worship of GOD;</hi> and from this time forward
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63323:128"/>
began the <hi>Jews</hi> once again to be their own <hi>Masters,</hi> and to give <hi>Laws</hi> to their <hi>Neighbour Princes.</hi> Yet this <hi>Simon</hi> was also slain by Treachery; but his Son (called <hi>John</hi>) revenged his Death, grew great, and prevailed against the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and left his Estate to <hi>Aristobulus</hi> his eldest Son. This Man would be called <hi>King,</hi> but died after one years Reign, and his Brother <hi>Alexander</hi> succeeded him, who had an unquiet Reign with the <hi>Syrians</hi> and his own Rebellious <hi>Subjects</hi> for 27 years. Before these times, the <hi>Jews</hi> were become famous for their knowledge, especially in Divine things.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Jews</hi> return from <hi>Captivity,</hi> there was one named <hi>Ezra,</hi> a Famous <hi>Scribe,</hi> or <hi>Learned Man;</hi> after him was <hi>Simon the Just,</hi> a great promoter of <hi>Learning;</hi> after him rose up <hi>Antigonus Socheus,</hi> who was a great <hi>Zealot</hi> for <hi>Gods Laws,</hi> and had many follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but from his corrupted <hi>Zeal</hi> sprang up the Sect of the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> There was also one <hi>Sadoc,</hi> who was <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Pupil, who in the end being tired with the strict <hi>Religious Life,</hi> fell off, and became the Father of the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces;</hi> and <hi>John Hircanus</hi> (the <hi>High Priest</hi>) being troubled with the Insolences of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> became a profest <hi>Sadducee,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his Sons after him. But in the Reign of this <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were so popular, that they gave Law even to the <hi>King,</hi> and occasioned great Troubles. After this <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> his Wife <hi>Salome</hi> Reigned some years; but at her Death, <hi>Aristobulus</hi> the younger Son was very troublesom, even to the disthroning of his Elder Brother. In those days came <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> into <hi>Syria,</hi> in pursuit of his Conquests, and taking advantage of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> took <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned the <hi>Temple,</hi> and left them in Servitude to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A while after came <hi>Crassus</hi> by, in his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Expedition, and robb'd the <hi>Temple;</hi> but in the end <hi>Herod</hi> (the Son of <hi>Antipater</hi>) an <hi>Edomite,</hi> a Man tho' of a base and mean Parentage, by his Subtilty and great Fortune gain'd the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and reigned many years. In the latter end of whose Reign was our <hi>Saviour Jesus Christ</hi> born, and in these days the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> flourish'd in Wealth, Peace, and Honour, as well as in all manner of Wisdom and Knowledge; only the <hi>Jews</hi> could not be well satisfied in being under the Government of this <hi>Stranger,</hi> and to be sway'd by the <hi>Roman Power.</hi> But alas! their <hi>Pride</hi> was their greatest overthrow; for their not receiving the <hi>LORD of Life,</hi> they lost that Liberty and Blessing which he brought down from <hi>Heaven</hi> for them, had they not despised it, and contemned him and his <hi>Doctrin</hi> taught amongst them, and in the end <hi>Crucified</hi> him betwixt two <hi>Thieves;</hi> but they knew not the things that belonged to their <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happiness,</hi> they being hid from their Eyes; and therefore was it foretold what <hi>Calamities</hi> should befal them, and that one <hi>Stone</hi> should not be left upon another of all its <hi>Buildings</hi> she so boasted of, <hi>Luke</hi> 19, 43, 44. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.6. and so accordingly it came to pass.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Forty years</hi> (under the Type of so many <hi>Days</hi>) GOD had promised to bear the <hi>Iniquity of the House of</hi> Judah, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.6. and this seem'd to be fulfilled at this time, for so many years, bearing date from the <hi>Murther</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> until the total destruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> were fulfilled. In the year of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> 32 finished, and 33 currant, was our <hi>Saviour</hi> Crucified; the <hi>Jews</hi> crying out to <hi>Pontius Pilate, His Blood be upon us and our Children, Matth.</hi> 27.25. And many years after this went away these <hi>Murtherers</hi> unpunish'd, as if they had done no hurt; and the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> suffer'd much, some being <hi>Martyr'd,</hi> others <hi>Imprison'd,</hi> and persecuted from place to place: But as these <hi>forty years</hi> began to wax nigh, so <hi>Vengeance</hi> began to draw upon them, and first (like a gathering <hi>Cloud</hi>) it hover'd o're head, and shed its Drops round about <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> before the <hi>City</hi> it self felt the smart.</p>
                     <p>The first that felt this Vengeance after the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> were the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who being detected in certain Treacheries upon <hi>Fulvia</hi> a Noble <hi>Romish Lady,</hi> and complain'd of to <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour, by <hi>Siturnius</hi> the Ladies Husband; all the <hi>Jews</hi> that were there, for the sake of those few that were faulty, were banish'd, slaughter'd, and driven into <hi>Sardinia,</hi> being many thousands. Next unto these at <hi>Rome,</hi> were those at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who upon a small Quarrel in the days of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus</hi> the Emperour, for 3 years together, were continually persecuted with Scorns, Robberies Slaughters and Exile, to a great devastation. After this about the beginning of <hi>Claudius,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Babylon</hi> felt the same smart, thousands being kill'd, and the Survivors escaping fled into <hi>Seleucia;</hi> where (after two years respite) both the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Syrians</hi> fell upon them, and slew about 50000 of them; from thence the Remnant that escaped, fled to <hi>Ctesiphon;</hi>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:63323:129"/>
but here all <hi>Nations</hi> joyned against them, and drove them away to the strong Holds of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silis</hi> and <hi>Nearda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Jerusalem</hi> began to be a Fellow-sufferer; for in the days of <hi>Cumanus</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, by reason of a quarrel with the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel</hi> at the <hi>Temple Gate,</hi> about 20000 Men were slain at the <hi>Passover</hi> time. The next that fell upon them was in the time of <hi>Foelix</hi> the Governour, where many were slaughtered both at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Cesarca.</hi> But as the 40 years grew near the accomplishment, <hi>Gessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Florus</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Nero</hi> came to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> who gave himself who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Blood and Revenge against them, so that in the 23<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Nero,</hi> and the 65<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> many thousands of them were slain by his means at <hi>Cesarca,</hi> and not long after the <hi>Persecution</hi> came to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where those Noble <hi>Jews</hi> that were honoured with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Knighthood</hi> suffered under this <hi>Florus,</hi> many of them perishing by publick Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Slaughter; but these were but the beginning of <hi>Sorrows,</hi> for presently the Wars broke out, and (as if all Nations had hated the <hi>Jews</hi>) they began in all places to make slaughter of them. At <hi>Cesarea,</hi> the <hi>Syrians</hi> slew about 30000 of them: At <hi>Scythopolis,</hi> the Inhabitants slew about 13000 of them: At <hi>Ascalon,</hi> about 10000: At <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> about 20000: At <hi>Tyrus</hi> a great many; the like at <hi>Gadara:</hi> At <hi>Alexandria</hi> the old grudge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> there slew about 50000 more. <hi>Cestius Gallus</hi> burnt and spoiled the City <hi>Zabulon; Cesinnius Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> slew about 2000 in <hi>Asamon,</hi> and <hi>Cestius</hi> slew about 8000 more in <hi>Joppa.</hi> At <hi>Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> were slain about 10000; <hi>Antonius,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Askelon</hi> slew in Battle about 10000 at one time, and 8000 at another: After this came <hi>Vespasian</hi> into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and wasting the <hi>Country,</hi> took <hi>Gadara,</hi> where he killed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy: <hi>Titus</hi> his Son at <hi>Japha</hi> slew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 15000; <hi>Vespasian</hi> took <hi>Jetapata,</hi> and slew there about 40000 Men. At <hi>Joppa</hi> perished by Shipwreck and Slaughter 4200: At <hi>Tarichaea</hi> upon the <hi>Lake,</hi> were slain and taken <hi>Captives</hi> above 13000; at <hi>Gamala</hi> perished near 9000 more, and at <hi>Giscala</hi> were slain and taken <hi>Captives</hi> about 5000 more. In the 13<hi>th</hi> year of <hi>Nero, Gadara</hi> was taken a 2<hi>d</hi> time, and near 15000 <hi>Jews</hi> slain and taken <hi>Captives:</hi> Next at <hi>Begabri</hi> and <hi>Caphariopha,</hi> about 10000 perished, and 1000 made <hi>Captives;</hi> and lastly, at <hi>Jericho</hi> and thereabouts were great slaughters made. For all which I refer the Reader to <hi>Josephus</hi>'s History, where all is more largely handled. But now for some time these slaughters had some intermission, occasioned by <hi>Nero</hi>'s Death, and <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s Absence; yet great slaughters were amongst them. But the great destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hapned unto them in the 70<hi>th</hi> year of our <hi>LORD,</hi> when <hi>Vespasian</hi> (who Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>East,</hi> that he might restrain the frequent Seditions of the <hi>Jews.</hi>) after he had possest himself of divers places in <hi>Judea,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to make himself master of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and to that end blockt it up at a distance by several <hi>Forts,</hi> which cut off Provisions from the <hi>City,</hi> and incommoded the several ways; but hearing of the Death of <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Galba,</hi> together with Disorders that arose from the Contests between <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Vitellius,</hi> he retir'd to <hi>Cesarea,</hi> where he had an eye to all the Territories thereabouts, shewing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for the prosperity of the <hi>Empire,</hi> than for foreign Conquests; so that for his Vertue he was chosen <hi>Emperour,</hi> and maintained in that Dignity by the <hi>Forces</hi> he Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. His Affairs in <hi>Egypt</hi> being set in order, and Preparations made for his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> his Son <hi>Titus</hi> return'd to <hi>Judaea,</hi> to finish there what his <hi>Father</hi> had begun; his design being very much facilitated by the Dissentions at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was divided into three facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cruelly warring upon each other within the <hi>Walls</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> burning each others <hi>Houses,</hi> and setting <hi>fire</hi> to the publick <hi>Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines,</hi> to the destruction of a great quantity of <hi>Ammunition</hi> and <hi>Provisions,</hi> of which they were reduc'd to a most lamentable want when the <hi>City</hi> was besieged. So dreadful a confusion of Mischief and Slaughter there was amongst these wretched People, that they forbore not to kill one another even in the <hi>Temple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>During these <hi>Strifes</hi> and <hi>Tumults</hi> there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared over this <hi>City</hi> a <hi>Comet</hi> in form of a <hi>Sword,</hi> which seemed to denounce further <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> to come upon these <hi>Impious People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Titus</hi> encampt himself round about, and laid a formal Siege: whereupon the <hi>Besieged</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it then time to unite against the <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> stoutly defended themselves, and made frequent <hi>Sallies</hi> upon them; by which means, although they more and more exasperated the <hi>Romans</hi> against them, yet <hi>Titus</hi> forbore not to make several overtures of Treaty for <hi>Peace,</hi> offering them good Conditions, which they foolishly rejected with Insolence and Scorn.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63323:129"/>
The truth is, the <hi>Besiegers</hi> made but slow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress for a great while, and perhaps had been hard put to it, had not a new Dissention arose amongst the <hi>Besieged,</hi> only the three foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Parties were reduced to two, the Heads whereof were <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Simon;</hi> and they also, when they observ'd <hi>Titus</hi> at the Head of his <hi>Troops</hi> preparing for a General Assault, so far united; that they made a shift to beat them off, and rendred wholly successless this first Assault of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who nevertheless conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to batter the first <hi>Wall</hi> with their <hi>Batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rams</hi> and other Warlike <hi>Machins,</hi> and at length made such a breach in it, that the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged</hi> were forc'd to abandon it, and retire within the second <hi>Wall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi>Romans</hi> became Masters of the <hi>outward Wall</hi> the 7<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> and five days after they gained the <hi>second Wall;</hi> yet <hi>Titus</hi> strictly forbid the slaughtering of any that should be taken, as also the burning of their <hi>Houses,</hi> by which civility he so far won upon the generality of the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> that they began to hearken to a <hi>Surrender;</hi> but the <hi>Mutineers</hi> opposed even to a threatning with Death any one that should dare to speak any more of it, though still <hi>Titus</hi> offered them very good Conditions. Upon this new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of keeping the place, the <hi>Besieged</hi> sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied out and drove the <hi>Romans</hi> from the 2<hi>d Retrenchment;</hi> but 4 days after the <hi>Besiegers</hi> retake it, raze down the <hi>Wall,</hi> and put strong Guards into the <hi>Towers. Titus</hi> preparing to attack the 3<hi>d Wall,</hi> to avoid the further ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of <hi>Blood,</hi> sends a new Summons to the <hi>Besieged;</hi> but the obstinate Party infatuated to their ruin, will hearken to no Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then an Attack is made upon the <hi>Tower</hi> or <hi>Fort Antonia,</hi> on both sides at once, and two high <hi>Batteries</hi> raised, to pour down from each side upon the Defendants: To whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, at the same time he sent <hi>Josephus,</hi> to represent unto them the desperateness of their Condition, in case they hearkned not in time to some reasonable terms of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but instead of yielding to Reason, they drove back the <hi>Embassador</hi> with Arrow-shot, and a return of scoffing Messages to him that sent him, althô at the same time reduc'd to a most prodigious <hi>Famine,</hi> even very near to the devouring one another; however they burn and ruin'd the <hi>Batteries</hi> of the <hi>Assailants,</hi> and render'd them useless. On the other side, <hi>Titus</hi> blocks them up so close, that nothing could be carried in or out; moreover, they were so pester'd and annoy'd with the dead <hi>Carkasses,</hi> that they were forc'd for want of other convenience of Burial, to convey them (as well as they could) out of the <hi>Wall,</hi> to keep their <hi>Houses, Streets,</hi> and <hi>publick places</hi> free.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Deserter</hi> reported to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that at one <hi>Gate</hi> (where he kept Guard during the Siege) no less than 115880 <hi>Bodies</hi> had been carried out; and it is affirm'd for a Truth, that all the <hi>Gates</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> had sent out at least 600000 of the poorest sort, besides a great number of those that were not carried out, but were thrown on heaps in the out-places of certain great <hi>Houses,</hi> where they fell sick and died. Within the <hi>City</hi> a Bushel of <hi>Corn</hi> was sold for 600 <hi>Crowns;</hi> the poor fed upon such things as they could find, as <hi>Grass, Hay, Old Hides,</hi> and <hi>Cow-dung</hi> was a delicate Dish; yet could not all these dismal Accidents dispose these obdurate <hi>Wretches</hi> to a Surrender.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of <hi>July</hi> the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia</hi> being taken by force, the <hi>Besieged</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themselves to the <hi>Temple,</hi> where after <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> had raged for some time, to the slaughter of vast Multitudes, as well of the <hi>Assailants</hi> as <hi>Defendants,</hi> at length (much against the Will of <hi>Titus,</hi> who had a great mind to have preserved so noble a Structure) the <hi>Temple</hi> took fire the 10<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>August,</hi> being the very same <hi>Month</hi> and <hi>Day</hi> that the first <hi>Temple</hi> had been destroyed and burnt by the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> being 1130 <hi>Years,</hi> 7 <hi>Months,</hi> and 15 <hi>Days,</hi> according to the most received computation after the said <hi>Temple</hi> was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and 639 <hi>Years</hi> and 45 <hi>Days</hi> after the second had been rebuilt by <hi>Zorobabel.</hi> However this Computation agrees not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who allow but 410 <hi>Years</hi> duration to the first <hi>Temple,</hi> and 420 to the second. In this expugnation and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Temple,</hi> there was so great a slaughter of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that fled thither for Sanctuary, (the fury of the <hi>Conquerour</hi> neither sparing Age nor Sex) that the blood of the slain flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a River down the <hi>Steps;</hi> and tho' the grand <hi>Mutineers</hi> made their escape and defence from place to place for a few days, yet at last they served only to compleat the Number, and to fill the <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>publick Places</hi> with their dead <hi>Carkasses.</hi>

                        <p>The Work which <hi>GOD</hi> had ordained <hi>Moses</hi> first to begin, was this <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> It was 30 <hi>Cubits</hi> long, and 10 large; it was boarded on all sides, and covered within and without with <hi>Stuffs;</hi> those within were exceeding rich, and those without were of <hi>Skins</hi> fit to resist all the injuries of Weather.

another, the better to resist all sorts of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                        <p>This was the construction of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> which (S. <hi>Austin</hi> saith) was full of Mysteries, and was a visible <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> This <hi>Portative Temple,</hi> which was transported in several places, did denote the <hi>Church</hi> whilst it is yet here on <hi>Earth,</hi> and in a state of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stability and place of Passage; as since the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> figures the <hi>Church</hi> to be in its state of stability, and in its <hi>Heavenly Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> The <hi>Boards</hi> which made the <hi>Walls</hi> in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> signified the strong <hi>Persons</hi> which uphold the whole <hi>Church</hi> by the solidity of their <hi>Vertue.</hi> The <hi>Silver Bases</hi> upon which they were placed, did denote the Purity of the <hi>Doctrin</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> upon which she is fixed. The <hi>Golden Tapestries,</hi> adorned with <hi>Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery</hi> of different sorts, which glistered on all sides of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> signified the different <hi>Vertues</hi> of the <hi>Elect,</hi> which altogether form an agreeable <hi>Variety</hi> to the Glory of GOD, and Ornament of the <hi>Church.</hi>

                        <p>But as the <hi>Fathers</hi> do very well remark, each particular part of this <hi>Tabernacle</hi> did not compose only a Dwelling-place where GOD did inhabit.

                        <p>There was upon this <hi>Propitiatory</hi> two <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,</hi> which regarded each other, and which extended their <hi>Wings</hi> all along the <hi>Ark,</hi> as it were to serve for a <hi>Throne</hi> to his <hi>Majesty;</hi> which hath given occasion to those manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions so frequently used in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which represent unto us GOD seated upon the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims.</hi> GOD also caused to be fixed on the four corners of the <hi>Ark, Golden Rings;</hi> and ordered <hi>Staves</hi> to be made of <hi>Shittim Wood,</hi> cover'd with <hi>Gold,</hi> which were always put through the <hi>four Rings,</hi> and served to carry the <hi>Ark</hi> when the <hi>Camp</hi> moved.

                        <p>Altho, that this <hi>Ephod</hi> was very strait, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless the <hi>High Priest</hi> did not stick to girt it closer, with a <hi>Girdle</hi> of rich <hi>Embroidery.</hi> He had upon his <hi>Tyer</hi> or <hi>Head-Band</hi> a <hi>Plate</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> which cover'd his <hi>Forehead,</hi> on which were engraven these words, <hi>Holiness belongs to the</hi> LORD.</p>
                        <p>All the Glory of these <hi>Habits,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatness thereof, were nothing, when we fix our Eyes on that Magnificence which was figured by it. <hi>The</hi> Gold <hi>sparkled</hi> (saith S. <hi>Gregory) to shew, that GOD chiefly demands</hi> Wisdom <hi>in those which approach his</hi> Altar, <hi>even a Wisdom of</hi> Godliness, <hi>which renders their</hi> Life <hi>more pleasing to him, than their</hi> Priestly Garments <hi>are to the Eyes of</hi> Men. <hi>These</hi> little Bells <hi>signifie to the</hi> Priests, <hi>that their</hi> Lives <hi>ought to speak, and that their</hi> Actions <hi>ought to dispose</hi> Men <hi>to think on</hi> GOD. <hi>These</hi> Bells <hi>made no noise when the</hi> High Priest <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not, and</hi> Ministers <hi>edifie not their</hi> People <hi>at such times as they advance not in</hi> Piety.</p>

                        <p>Just before the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> GOD had caused another <hi>Altar</hi> to be made, which stood in the <hi>Court,</hi> as it was appointed for the <hi>Burnt-Offerings,</hi> which was not covered. It was call'd <hi>The Altar of the Holocaust,</hi> that is, <hi>whole Burnt-Offerings.</hi> It was square, being 5 <hi>Cubits</hi> long, and as many broad, and 3 in height.

                           <hi>These two</hi> Altars (according to S. <hi>Gregory) did denote, during the</hi> Ancient Law, <hi>the state of</hi> Souls <hi>in the</hi> New Law, <hi>and the two different</hi> Orders <hi>which should be always in the</hi> Church; <hi>that is to say, that of</hi> Penitence, <hi>and that of</hi> Innocence. <hi>One of these two Altars was in the</hi> Tabernacle, <hi>and the other without, to signifie to the</hi> Penitent, <hi>that they are yet unworthy to enter into the</hi> Temple, <hi>one of these</hi> Altars <hi>was appointed, to burn the Flesh of</hi> Animals, <hi>which admirably represents the exteriour</hi> Actions <hi>of</hi> Repentance, <hi>by which the</hi> Penitent <hi>offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in some sort to GOD, and consumes as an</hi> Holocaust; <hi>the other was reserved to burn the</hi> Perfumes, <hi>to raise up to</hi> Heaven <hi>the</hi> Odour <hi>and</hi> Smoke <hi>of the</hi> Incense; <hi>which signified the heat of</hi> Charity <hi>in their</hi> Souls, <hi>and the fervour of their</hi> Prayers. <hi>So one of these</hi> Altars <hi>is for those that sigh as yet, in remembrance and resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their</hi> Sins; <hi>and the other is for those that sigh no longer, but thro' the desire of</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>and GOD, who there inhabits.

All the Magnificence of succeeding <hi>Princes</hi> have not been equal to his, and they might pass for poor and private <hi>Persons</hi> in comparison to him.</p>
                        <p>There was every Day used in this <hi>Kings House</hi> about 11 <hi>Hogsheads</hi> of <hi>sine Flower,</hi> and about 22 of <hi>ordinary,</hi> 10 <hi>Fat Oxen,</hi> and 20 others taken out of the <hi>Pastures,</hi> likewise 100 <hi>Sheep,</hi> besides an infinite number of <hi>Venison,</hi> with all sorts of <hi>Fowl</hi> both Tame and Wild. He had 40000 <hi>Horses</hi> for <hi>Draught,</hi> and 12000 for the <hi>Sadle;</hi> all which were fed and kept in a most excellent order.</p>
                        <p>This great Plenty was occasion'd by reason of the <hi>Peace</hi> which all <hi>Judea</hi> enjoyed, and this occasioned <hi>Solomon</hi> to have the Name of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick.</hi> It was this <hi>Peace</hi> that was necessary for him for his design of building the <hi>Temple,</hi> first design'd by <hi>David,</hi> but could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd by reason of his many <hi>Wars.</hi> This young <hi>Prince</hi> used his utmost endeavours to accomplish this Undertaking, employing for the building thereof 80000 <hi>Stone-Cutters,</hi> 70000 <hi>Labourers,</hi> and 3600 <hi>Overseers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>Temple</hi> was begun in the 4<hi>th</hi> Year of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reign, 480 years after the <hi>Israelites</hi> going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and it was finish'd in the beginning of the <hi>Year</hi> 3000, being just a 1000 <hi>Years</hi> before the Birth of the <hi>Messias,</hi> of which it was a <hi>Figure.</hi> So <hi>Solomon</hi> (who was not much above 20 years old when he began this Work) had the good fortune to raise the First <hi>Temple</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> to the Name and Glory of the <hi>True GOD,</hi> and to accomplish in few years the most Magnificent Building, which until that time had ever been seen; which is at large set down in the 6<hi>th Chapter</hi> of the 1<hi>st</hi> Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> as to its bigness, richness of Building, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which I refer the Reader.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Too happy</hi> (saith S. <hi>Ambrose) if</hi> Solomon <hi>had taken care by raising a</hi> Temple <hi>to GOD, so to fix himself in</hi> Humility, <hi>that his</hi> Soul <hi>might have been a</hi> Temple <hi>more acceptable, than that which he caused to be built!

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63323:132"/>
with an infinite Expence) he made this Work, which by reason of its vast largeness, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly describ'd in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and deserves a particular Explication.</p>
                        <p>It was a <hi>Brazen Vessel</hi> extreamly large, being 5 <hi>Cubits</hi> high, 6 large, and 30 about, so that it would hold about 300 <hi>Hogsheads</hi> of Liquor, according to our Measures. It was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd by 12 <hi>Brazen Oxen,</hi> 3 of which regarded each quarter of the <hi>Heavens.</hi> It was enrich'd with all sorts of Ornaments, as <hi>Festoons,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of <hi>Animals,</hi> and of all such things as the most curious Artists could invent.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Brazen Sea</hi> was put by <hi>Solomons</hi> Order in the <hi>Temple,</hi> where it served to purifie the <hi>Priests</hi> when they went in to exercise their <hi>Priestly Functions.

                        <p>
                           <hi>It was this that gave occasion to many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to believe, that when the</hi> Priests <hi>went to offer</hi> Incense <hi>to GOD, that they went Bare-footed, and GOD ordained them to wash themselves in that manner upon pain of Death, the</hi> Scripture <hi>commanding, that this</hi> Law <hi>be observed for ever; signifying very clearly even then (all those</hi> Sacrifices <hi>being then but the</hi> Figures <hi>of what was to come) what</hi> Purity <hi>he required one day from the</hi> Ministers <hi>and</hi> Priests <hi>of his</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars <hi>of the</hi> New Law.</p>

                           <hi>Solomon</hi> assembles all <hi>Israel,</hi> in order to the solemn Dedication of the Temple.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AS soon as <hi>Solomon</hi> had finished all the <hi>Buildings</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils</hi> and <hi>Furnitures</hi> thereof,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 3001. <hi>before Christ</hi> 1003.</note> he resolved solemnly to <hi>dedicate</hi> and <hi>consecrate</hi> the same, and to bring up the <hi>Ark</hi> from the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> for to place it therein.</p>
                     <p>It will not be amiss to observe the several Removes of the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>GOD;</hi> so famous in <hi>Scripture.</hi> The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Ark</hi> being first made by <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>Desert,</hi> were afterwards by <hi>Joshua</hi> set up at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the 7th year after that the <hi>Israelites</hi> had past through <hi>Jordan.</hi> This <hi>Shiloh</hi> was a <hi>City</hi> in the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and seems to have been the same with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> where <hi>Melchisedech</hi> reigned, and near to which St. <hi>John</hi> baptized. In this place the <hi>Ark</hi> continued 328 years, till the time that the <hi>Israelites</hi> carried it into their <hi>Camp</hi> against the <hi>Philistins,</hi> who took it and sent it back 7 years after. Upon its Return into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> it was placed in the House of <hi>Abina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> in <hi>Kiriath-jearim,</hi> where it continued 70 years, and then translated from thence to the House of <hi>Obed-edom,</hi> where it abode only three Months; at the end of which <hi>David</hi> transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to <hi>Zion,</hi> which was the <hi>Citadel</hi> of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> It seems likely also that at the same time the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> which had continued all this while at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> was set up at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> a City in the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But 40 years after this, at the time of the Dedication of the <hi>Temple, Solomon</hi> placed the <hi>Ark</hi> and the <hi>Brazen Altar</hi> there, where they continued 424 years, at which time <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> took <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and burnt the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> which being foreseen by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet, he took care to convey the <hi>Ark</hi> to <hi>Mount Pisgah,</hi> where he was assured by <hi>GOD</hi> it should remain unknown till the return of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> from the <hi>Babylonish Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity;</hi> which makes it more than probable, that the said <hi>Ark</hi> was afterwards placed in the <hi>Second Temple,</hi> which was begun by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and finished by <hi>Darius,</hi> Kings of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But amongst all these Translations of the <hi>Ark,</hi> none was so famous as that which was performed at this time by <hi>Solomon,</hi> who to render this Solemnity the more august and glorious, invited all <hi>Israel</hi> to be present at it. He himself marched before the <hi>Ark,</hi> which was carried by the <hi>Priests,</hi> both he and all the People sacrificing <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Oxen,</hi> that could not be told for number. As soon as they were come into the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Priests</hi> placed the <hi>Ark</hi> in the most <hi>Holy Place,</hi> under the <hi>Wings</hi> of the <hi>Cherubims;</hi> and when they were come out from thence, the <hi>Cloud</hi> of the <hi>Divine Presence</hi> filled the <hi>Temple,</hi> so that the <hi>Priests</hi> could not stand to <hi>Minister,</hi> because the Glory of the <hi>LORD</hi> had fill'd the <hi>House.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> was overjoyed, when he saw this pregnant Testimony of the <hi>LORD's</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the <hi>Place</hi> which he had erected to the Glory of his <hi>Name;</hi> and kneeling down in this transport of <hi>Joy</hi> before the <hi>Altar,</hi> he said. <hi>Is it possible that GOD should condescend to dwell upon the Earth? behold the Heaven, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens cannot contain thee, and how much less then this House that I have built?</hi> He entreated the <hi>LORD</hi> to bless his <hi>People,</hi> and to hear favourably the <hi>Prayers</hi> of those who should address to him in this <hi>Holy Place,</hi> which he had <hi>sanctified</hi> by his Presence; that when his <hi>People</hi> should be oppressed by their <hi>Enemies,</hi> they might find a sure <hi>Refuge</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> against them in this <hi>Holy Place;</hi> that when their <hi>Sins</hi> at any time should make the <hi>Heavens</hi> to be shut up over them, that then the <hi>Prayers</hi> which should be offered up in this <hi>Temple,</hi> might open the <hi>Windows</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and bring down <hi>Rain</hi> upon the <hi>Earth;</hi> and in a word, That his <hi>Eyes</hi> might always be open, and his <hi>Ears</hi> attentive to all the Supplications of his <hi>People,</hi> that at any time, or upon any occasion should be made there, to avert from them all the <hi>Evils</hi> they feared, and to procure them all the <hi>Blessings</hi> they desired.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Solemnity</hi> lasted 14 <hi>Days,</hi> because it fell in with the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> which added 7 <hi>Days</hi> to the <hi>Feast</hi> of the <hi>Dedication;</hi> which being ended, <hi>Solomon</hi> sent home the <hi>People</hi> full of joy and gladness of Heart, for all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the <hi>LORD</hi> had done for <hi>David</hi> his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and for <hi>Israel</hi> his <hi>People. Solomon</hi> having offered at this Solemnity 20000 <hi>Oxen,</hi> and 120000 <hi>Sheep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fathers</hi> observe, <hi>That</hi> Solomon's <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour on this occasion ought to imprint a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found respect in all</hi> Christians, <hi>at their entring into the</hi> Church, <hi>as enjoying there the truth and substance of what the</hi> Jews <hi>had only a shadow and glimmering of in their</hi> Tabernacle <hi>and</hi> Temple.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>SOlomon</hi> having finish'd and furnish'd the <hi>Temple,</hi> which he had built for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>GOD,</hi> and for the Glory of his <hi>Name,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 3013. <hi>before Christ</hi> 991.</note> began to build a <hi>Palace</hi> for himself, about which he spent 13 years, the <hi>Magnificence</hi> and <hi>Sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> of which was beyond expression, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all shining and lustrous with <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones,</hi> so as to dazle the Eyes of <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;</hi> and all the <hi>Architecture</hi> and <hi>carved Work</hi> thereof was most curious and wonderful to behold.</p>
                     <p>These astonishing Effects of his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Magnificence,</hi> soon proclaim'd his Fame and Renown throughout all the Corners of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and brought <hi>Ambassadors</hi> in crowds from all <hi>Princes</hi> that had heard of his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to congratulate his great Glory, and to take a view of his more than <hi>Regal Magnificence;</hi> considering him as the Miracle not only of his Age, but of all that were past before him.</p>
                     <p>But the Person that testified the most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and impatient desire to see <hi>Solomon,</hi> and to be an Ear-witness of his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> was the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> who came from the farthest part of the <hi>South,</hi> to see whether the advantagious and stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Reports of that young <hi>King</hi> were true or not? She came to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with a vast train of <hi>Guards</hi> and <hi>Attendants,</hi> and with a numerous Company of <hi>Camels</hi> bearing <hi>Spices, Gold,</hi> and <hi>precious Stones;</hi> of which she made a Present to the <hi>King,</hi> bestowing upon him 120 <hi>Talents</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> which amount to about 800000 <hi>l. Sterling,</hi> besides <hi>Spices, Perfumes,</hi> and <hi>peecious Stones,</hi> to a prodigious value.</p>
                     <p>This great and wise <hi>Queen,</hi> after she had taken a full and exact notice of the unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd Magnificence of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wisdom of his Discourse, and his Sagacity in answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Questions, his penetrating insight into the deepest Mysteries; the order of his <hi>House,</hi> as to the <hi>Meat</hi> of his <hi>Table;</hi> the Attendance of his <hi>Ministers, Officers</hi> and <hi>Servants;</hi> and the transcendent Riches of their <hi>Liveries;</hi> their Sitting; his <hi>Cupbearers,</hi> and his ascent by which he went up to the <hi>House of the LORD,</hi> she was quite transported, <hi>and</hi> (as the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> expresseth it) <hi>there remained no more Spirit in her:</hi> And addressing her self to <hi>Solomon,</hi> said, <hi>I find now it was true, O King, what was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me in my own Country, of thy Wisdom and Heroick Acts: but thy Renown so far surpassing any thing that ever I had heard of, or could well imagine, it also surpast my belief, till now, that mine own</hi> Eyes <hi>and</hi> Ears <hi>have convinced me, that the one half has not been told me of thy</hi> Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Grandeur <hi>and</hi> Magnificence; <hi>and that common Fame, which I thought had been too lavish in setting forth thy Praise, has indeed detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from and obscured thy</hi> Glory. <hi>Blessed and happy are these thy</hi> Officers, Ministers, <hi>and</hi> Servants, <hi>that stand continually before thee, and hear thy</hi> Wisdom, <hi>and the piercing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity of thy</hi> Judgment; <hi>and blessed be the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD, <hi>which delighted in thee to set thee on the</hi> Throne <hi>of</hi> Israel. <hi>For because the</hi> LORD <hi>loved</hi> Israel, <hi>therefore made he thee</hi> King, <hi>to do</hi> Judgment <hi>and</hi> Justice <hi>amongst his</hi> People.</p>
                     <p>Thus this great <hi>Queen</hi> return'd to her own <hi>Country</hi> with joy and gladness, being fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with what she had heard and seen, as well as with the <hi>Presents</hi> she received from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and the Answer of all her Desires and Questions, to the full content of her Heart.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fathers</hi> tell us, <hi>That this</hi> Princess <hi>was a lively and excellent Emblem of the</hi> Church, <hi>and we have reason to fear, that (according to the Words of our</hi> Saviour) she will rise up in Judgment against us one day; for whereas she did not think much to come from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most parts of the <hi>Earth</hi> to hear the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and in a strange transport of Joy and Wonder, pronounc'd those <hi>blessed</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi> that had the advantage of being near him, and of serving him; <hi>We</hi> Christians <hi>(on the contrary) who have</hi> GOD <hi>for our</hi> Master, <hi>the Wisdom of</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>for our Rule,</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>and all the Riches and Glory of it for our Reward, do frequently prefer</hi> Men <hi>before</hi> GOD, <hi>the Wisdom of this</hi> World <hi>before that of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, <hi>and the possession of the</hi> Earth, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of</hi> Heaven.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>We see <hi>Women</hi> here deceiving the wisest of <hi>Men,</hi> and corrupting and defiling a <hi>Heart,</hi> which for so many years had been the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the <hi>Altar</hi> from whence continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ascended the <hi>Flames</hi> of <hi>Divine Love.</hi> From the <hi>love</hi>

                     <p>This enormous Crime of <hi>Solomon,</hi> irritated <hi>GOD</hi> strangely against him. He now appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, not as heretofore, to approve of his Behaviour, or to promise him whatsoever he desired, but to witness his just Indignation against him, for having so wickedly broke his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and so shamefully transgrest his <hi>holy Law,</hi> assuring him he would rend his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> from him, and give it to his <hi>Servant,</hi> but that however for <hi>David's</hi> sake, he would leave his Son one <hi>Tribe.</hi>

                        <hi>Solomon</hi> understanding that this <hi>Servant</hi> the <hi>LORD</hi> had told him should inherit his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> was <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> whom he had brought up from a Youth, and to whom <hi>Ahijah</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> had foretold in the Name of the <hi>LORD,</hi> that he should be <hi>King</hi> over the <hi>Ten Tribes,</hi> did his endeavour to kill him, which obliged <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> to flee to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to desire the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>Shishak,</hi> King of that <hi>Country,</hi> where he continued till the Death of <hi>Solomon;</hi> who having reigned peaceably forty Years,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 3029. <hi>before Christ</hi> 975.</note> died when he was above sixty Years of Age, and was buried in the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>David</hi> his <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam</hi> his Son reigned in his stead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If</hi> Solomon's <hi>Fall</hi> and <hi>Apostacy were fatal to himself and his Posterity, yet it may be of great use and advantage to those who shall seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and with attention, consider of it with the Eyes of</hi> Faith. <hi>It is a strange thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that he who had been a Person so highly beloved, favoured and dignified by</hi> GOD, <hi>that it should not be certainly known, whether his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth not deserve more to be lamented and deplored, than praised or commended. For his</hi> Sin <hi>is certain and evident, as well as</hi> David's <hi>was; but this is the difference between them, that tho' the</hi> Father's <hi>Repentance was very certain from express Words of</hi> Scripture, <hi>that of the</hi> Son <hi>is as uncertain and doubtful: Though many have supposed the Book of</hi> Ecclesiastes <hi>to be a kind of Retractation of his</hi> Apostacy, <hi>written by him, and left to Posterity for a testimony of his</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>But this young <hi>Prince</hi> forsaking this good Advice of the <hi>old Men,</hi> consulted the <hi>young Men</hi> that were grown up with him; who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him to answer the <hi>People</hi> roughly, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, that they must expect to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by him with more severity than his <hi>Father</hi> had ever done; that his <hi>little Finger</hi> should be thicker than his <hi>Father's Loins;</hi> that whereas his <hi>Father</hi> did chastise them with <hi>Whips,</hi> he would chastise them with <hi>Scorpions;</hi> and that he should be so far from lessening their Burthens, that he was resolved on the contrary to increase them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> observes, that this hapned by a special disposal and permission of <hi>GOD,</hi> who suffer'd <hi>Rehoboam</hi> thus blindly to follow the rash and giddy Counsel of the <hi>young Men,</hi> and to reject the good and seasonable Advice of the <hi>old Men,</hi> that he might perform the Word which he had spoken by <hi>Ahijah</hi> the <hi>Shilonite,</hi> unto <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> that he should be <hi>King</hi> over <hi>Israel.</hi> For all the <hi>People</hi> as soon as they had received this churlish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome Answer from their new <hi>King,</hi> revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, protesting they would never own him for their <hi>Prince.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Rehoboam</hi> perceiving (when it was too late) the ill effect of his rash and indiscreet Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, sent <hi>Adoram</hi> his <hi>Treasurer</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pacifie them, and offer them better Terms: But his <hi>Subjects</hi> Minds were so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated by the outragious Reception and Answer he had given them; that instead of hearkning to him, and being perswaded by him, they <hi>stoned</hi> him to death: The Report of which no sooner came to <hi>Rehoboam's Ear,</hi> but he immediately got up into his <hi>Chariot</hi> and fled, for fear himself also should have fallen a <hi>Victim</hi> to their Rage and Fury.</p>
                     <p>Thus all <hi>Israel</hi> (that is, the Ten <hi>Tribes</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and proclaimed <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> King over them.

                     <p>This was the beginning of that famous Rent and Division of the Kingdom of <hi>Israel</hi> from that of <hi>Judah,</hi> which continued so long after through many Ages, as a lasting Monument of the Folly of a young <hi>King,</hi> who lost that by his Rashness and Indiscretion, which he might easily have preserved by his Wisdom, <hi>GOD</hi> also made it appear by this remarkable Instance, that he is the Master of <hi>Kings,</hi> and that he inspires them with good or ill Advice, according as they are the Subjects either of his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> or of his <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Severity.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now it hapned, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was offering <hi>Incense</hi> on one of these <hi>Altars</hi> in <hi>Bethel, GOD</hi> sent a <hi>Prophet</hi> to him, who addressing his Words to the <hi>Altar,</hi> prophesied against it, That a Child who was to be born of the Race of <hi>David,</hi> named <hi>Josiah,</hi> should kill and offer upon that <hi>Altar,</hi> all the <hi>Priests</hi> that offered <hi>Incense</hi> upon it, and that for a sign, that what he had said should certainly come to pass, the <hi>Altar</hi> should be rent, and the <hi>Ashes</hi> upon it poured forth at the same instant as it also hapned. Which denunciation of the <hi>Prophet</hi> was accordingly accomplished by <hi>Josiah</hi> 250 years after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jeroboam</hi> could not endure this holy liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> who prophesied against the <hi>Altar</hi> he himself had erected, and putting forth his <hi>Hand,</hi> he ordered his <hi>Officers</hi> to lay hold on him, but his <hi>Hand</hi> was immediately <hi>withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> and dried up, so that he could not draw it in again to him. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> greatly humbled by this remarkable instance of the <hi>Divine Vengeance,</hi> entreated the <hi>Prophet</hi> by his <hi>Prayers,</hi> to obtain his Cure of him, who so justly had smitten him; whereupon the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>God</hi> having besought the <hi>LORD</hi> for <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> his <hi>Hand</hi> was restored. Upon this the <hi>King</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the Man of <hi>GOD,</hi> to come home with him and refresh himself, and that afterward he would send him home with a <hi>Reward;</hi> which the <hi>Prophet</hi> utterly refused, declaring to the <hi>King,</hi> that the <hi>LORD</hi> had expresly forbid him to eat or drink in that place.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> was returning home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, an old <hi>Prophet</hi> that dwelt at <hi>Bethel</hi> having understood what he had done that day, and the Words he had denounced against the <hi>Altar Jeroboam</hi> had set up, he sadled his <hi>Ass</hi> and went after him, and having found him sitting under an <hi>Oak,</hi> desired him to go home with him and eat <hi>Bread;</hi> which when the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> had refused, as being charged to the contrary by <hi>GOD</hi> himself; the other answered, <hi>I am a</hi> Prophet <hi>as well as you, and an</hi> Angel <hi>commanded me to bring you back, that you might eat with me and refresh your self.</hi> And with this Lie he made the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> come back with him to his House.</p>
                     <p>But as they were sitting at <hi>Table,</hi> and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>LORD</hi> came to the old <hi>Prophet</hi> (that had seduced the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi>) and told him, <hi>That because he had disobeyed the Word of the</hi> LORD, <hi>and had eaten contrary to his express Command, he should not be buried with his</hi> Fathers. Which hapned accordingly; for as the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> was returning to <hi>Judah</hi> on the old <hi>Prophets Ass,</hi> a <hi>Lion</hi> met him by the way and slew him, without any farther devouring his dead body, or touching the <hi>Ass.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Gregory</hi> observes, <hi>That probably this</hi> Man of GOD <hi>had taken some secret Complacency and delight in the great things which he had done, in afflicting the</hi> King <hi>with so sudden a Stroke, and as suddenly healing him again, as well as in speaking to him with so great liberty; and that this</hi> Vain-glory <hi>wherewith he was eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had so over-clouded and darkned his</hi> Soul, <hi>that instead of obeying without dispute the</hi> Word <hi>of the</hi> LORD (<hi>or without putting his own Interpretation upon an express Command of</hi> GOD) <hi>he suffered himself to be deceived by the</hi> Prophet, <hi>which prov'd the cause of his death;</hi> GOD <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to inflict this short punishment upon his</hi> Body, <hi>that his</hi> Soul <hi>might be eternally saved.</hi>

                     <p>During this time of <hi>Drought</hi> and <hi>Scarcity,</hi> GOD sent <hi>Elijah</hi> to the <hi>Brook Cherith,</hi> where he took care to feed him by the ministry of two <hi>Ravens,</hi> who brought him <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Flesh</hi> twice a day, Morning and Evening. But the long continued <hi>Drought</hi> having at length dried up the <hi>Brook,</hi> so that he wanted Water to drink, GOD commanded him to go to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rephath,</hi> and to lodge there with a <hi>Widow Woman,</hi> whom he had commanded to take care of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Elijah</hi> obeyed the Divine Command, and when he was come near to the Gate of the <hi>City,</hi> he met with the <hi>Widow Woman,</hi> to whom the LORD had directed him, who was gathering of <hi>Sticks,</hi> and prayed her to fetch him a little <hi>Water</hi> to drink; and as she was going to fetch some for him, he called to her, and desired her to bring a bit of <hi>Bread:</hi> But the <hi>Woman</hi> told him she had not a bit in the House, nor indeed any thing besides an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of <hi>Meal,</hi> and a small remainder of <hi>Oil,</hi> and that she was gathering some <hi>Sticks,</hi> to bake a <hi>Cake</hi> of it, that she and her <hi>Son</hi> might eat it for their last Meal, and dye.</p>
                     <p>But this <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> who on this occasion was an illustrious Instance, that when <hi>GOD</hi> sends his <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> to any House, 'tis rather with design to heap <hi>Blessings</hi> upon them, who are so kind as to receive them, than to procure Relief or Comfort to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, wished his <hi>Hostess,</hi> to make first a little <hi>Cake</hi> for him of the <hi>Flour</hi> she had, and bring it to him; and that afterwards she might prepare the like for her self and <hi>Son;</hi> assuring her in the Name of the <hi>LORD,</hi> that the <hi>Meal</hi> should not waste, nor the Cruse of <hi>Oil</hi> fail, till the time that the <hi>LORD</hi> should send <hi>Rain</hi> again upon the <hi>Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This good <hi>Widow</hi> was transported with Joy, to see this great Miracle wrought, as <hi>Elijah</hi> had foretold, to which her <hi>Faith</hi> also contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted; and 'tis the more observable, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding she was an <hi>Idolatrous Woman,</hi> yet was willing in her great Necessity and Want to relieve this <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> even before she served her self, when at the same time his own <hi>Countrymen</hi> persecuted him; being a <hi>Figure</hi> herein of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> embracing <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> when the <hi>Jews</hi> at the same time (by <hi>Unbelief</hi>) rejected him.</p>
                     <p>But the Death of her only <hi>Son</hi> hapning not long after; cast her into extrream Sorrow, of which she complained with so much passion and bitterness to that <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> that being touch'd with her Grief, he took the <hi>dead Child,</hi> and having laid it upon his <hi>Bed,</hi> he stretched himself 3 times upon the <hi>dead Body,</hi> applying the parts of his <hi>Body</hi> to those of the <hi>Child;</hi> and cried unto the <hi>LORD,</hi> to let his <hi>Soul come into him again;</hi> which hapning accordingly, he restored him alive to his <hi>Mother.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> Miracle <hi>of</hi> Elijah <hi>contains an excellent representation of the holy Mystery of the</hi> Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>wherein the Divine living</hi> Body <hi>was applied to our dead</hi> Bodies, <hi>to quicken them from the</hi> death <hi>of</hi> Sin, <hi>to live the</hi> life <hi>of</hi> Righteousness <hi>and</hi> Holiness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This proceeding of the</hi> Prophet <hi>contains also an admirable Lesson for the</hi> Pastors <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>that they ought to proportion themselves to the littleness of their</hi> Hearers, <hi>and condescend to their Weakness;</hi> to measure themselves upon them, <hi>for so the</hi> Hebrew <hi>word signifies, by dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Truths of the</hi> Gospel <hi>to them, so as they are able to bear and digest them.</hi> Elijah <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the posture of his</hi> Body <hi>to the</hi> littleness of the Child, <hi>but it was in order to raise it to life again. Thus the</hi> Ministers <hi>may allay and temper the high Truths of the</hi> Gospel <hi>in condescension to the Weak; but all in order to raise them, and not at all to sink and fall down with them.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHilst the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> was safely lodg'd with the <hi>Widow</hi> of <hi>Zarephath, Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great search for him,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 3096. <hi>before Christ</hi> 908.</note> to put him to death; and not being able to find him, they discharged their Fury upon all the <hi>Prophets</hi> they could meet with.</p>
                     <p>Now when the time was come, that the <hi>LORD</hi> in pity to <hi>Israel</hi> resolved to put an end to this terrible <hi>Drought,</hi> which had lasted three years, he commanded <hi>Elijah</hi> to go and shew himself to <hi>Ahab.</hi> And accordingly he went to present himself before him, and by the way meeting with <hi>Obadiah,</hi> who was <hi>Ahab's High Steward,</hi> and a Man fearing <hi>GOD,</hi> he bad him go and tell <hi>Ahab</hi> he was there, and if he would he might speak with him. But <hi>Obadiah</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Fear, lest the <hi>Spirit of GOD</hi> might transport him elsewhere, whilst he went to deliver his Message to his <hi>Lord,</hi> whereby he would be left exposed to the <hi>King's</hi> Fury; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi> assured him, that he needed not fear any such thing, for that he was resolved to shew himself to <hi>Ahab</hi> that day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obadiah</hi> having delivered his Message to <hi>Ahab,</hi> he immediately came to meet <hi>Elijah,</hi> and as soon as he saw him, told him with a great deal of bitterness, That he was the cause of all the Troubles and Miseries of <hi>Israel.</hi> But <hi>Elijah,</hi> not at all daunted with the Words or Presence of this wicked <hi>King,</hi> answered him with a <hi>Spirit of Fire</hi> (which was his peculiar Gift) and said; <hi>'Tis not I that trouble</hi> Israel, <hi>but thou,</hi> O King, <hi>and thy</hi> Father's House, <hi>who have forsaken the living</hi> GOD, <hi>to</hi> sacrifice <hi>to</hi> Baal: <hi>Now therefore gather to me all</hi> Israel, <hi>and the</hi> Prophets <hi>of</hi> Baal <hi>at</hi> Mount Carmel.</p>
                     <p>This being perform'd by <hi>Ahab,</hi> who could not resist the <hi>Spirit</hi> that spake in <hi>Elijah,</hi> that <hi>Prophet</hi> demanded of the <hi>People</hi> with a <hi>fiery Zeal, How long halt ye between two Opinions? If the</hi> Lord <hi>be</hi> God, <hi>follow him, but if</hi> Baal <hi>be</hi> God, <hi>then follow him. Behold</hi> (continued he) <hi>I am left alone of all the</hi> Prophets <hi>of the</hi> Lord, <hi>at a time when</hi> Baal's Prophets <hi>are</hi> 450. And then addressing himself to the <hi>Priests,</hi> said, <hi>Take a</hi> Bullock <hi>and dress it, and lay it on the</hi> Altar, <hi>but without</hi> Fire, <hi>and I will take another in like manner; and call ye on the Name of your</hi> God, <hi>and I will call on the Name of the</hi> LORD, <hi>and let the</hi> God <hi>that answers by sending</hi> Fire <hi>from</hi> Heaven <hi>to consume the</hi> Sacrifice, <hi>be own'd to be the true</hi> God.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Israel</hi> approving of this just Proposal of <hi>Elijah,</hi> the <hi>Priests</hi> of <hi>Baal</hi> began to dress their <hi>Bullock,</hi> and having laid it on the <hi>Altar,</hi> they called upon the Name of <hi>Baal</hi> from Morning to Noon, saying, O Baal <hi>hear us!</hi> but without receiving any <hi>Answer;</hi> which gave occasion to <hi>Elijah</hi> in a holy Zeal, to mock and deride them; saying, <hi>Cry louder, for may be your</hi> God <hi>is on a Journey, or engaged in some Pursuit, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, and must be waked.</hi> But they seeing that they prevailed not, cut themselves (after their manner) with <hi>Knives</hi> and <hi>Lances</hi> till the <hi>Blood</hi> gusht out upon them, but all to no purpose.</p>
                     <p>Now when the time of <hi>Evening Sacrifice</hi> was come, <hi>Elijah</hi> built an <hi>Altar</hi> of 12 <hi>Stones</hi> and made a <hi>Trench</hi> round about it, and laid the <hi>Bullock</hi> upon the <hi>Wood</hi> on the <hi>Altar,</hi> and then ordered four <hi>Water-pots</hi> to be filled with <hi>Water</hi> three several times,<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>All the <hi>People</hi> convinced by this evident <hi>Miracle,</hi> fell down on their Faces, crying out, <hi>The Lord he is God! the Lord he is God!</hi> And <hi>Elijah</hi> laying hold of this opportunity, said unto them, <hi>Take the Prophets of</hi> Baal <hi>and kill them, without letting one of them escape.</hi> Which having been perform'd accordingly, <hi>Elijah</hi> promised <hi>Ahab,</hi> that <hi>GOD</hi> would very sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly send down <hi>Rain</hi> upon the <hi>Earth;</hi> which hapned according to his Word, insomuch, that <hi>Ahab</hi> was overtaken with it before he got to his <hi>House.</hi>

                     <p>

                           <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> (the Good and Pious King of <hi>Judah</hi>) makes all the <hi>Kings</hi> about him, to fear and stand in awe of him.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GOD</hi> sent a <hi>Prophet</hi> to reprove him of this Fault; who demanded of him, in the Name of his <hi>Great Master,</hi> whether he thought the Divine Assistance not sufficient to make him Victorious over all his <hi>Enemies,</hi> without seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Aid from <hi>Idolaters,</hi> who were an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto him?</p>
                     <p>But King <hi>Asa</hi> not being able to bear this free, but just Remonstrance of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> caused him to be seized and put in <hi>Prison;</hi> and oppressed also some of his Subjects at the same time. The <hi>Scripture</hi> also takes notice, that being for a long time afflicted with the <hi>Gout,</hi> he put more confidence in the Skill of his <hi>Physicians,</hi> than in the Help and Power of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus King <hi>Asa,</hi> after he had for a long time deserved the just praise of <hi>Men,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of <hi>GOD,</hi> by his Administration and Behaviour, worthy of a great and good <hi>Prince;</hi> at last dishonour'd his <hi>Life,</hi> and cast a blemish upon the Reputation he had so justly acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by a mixture of <hi>Actions,</hi> which were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther injurious to GOD, or cruel to <hi>Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joshaphat</hi> his Son succeeded him, who by walking in the steps of his Father <hi>David,</hi> and fearing GOD greatly, drew down the <hi>Divine Blessing</hi> upon his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> upon his <hi>Arms,</hi> and all his Undertakings, the <hi>LORD</hi> making him formidable to the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to all the <hi>Princes</hi> round about him. This good <hi>King</hi> encouraging himself in the ways of the LORD, did not at all express the same Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and Backwardness, as his Predecessors had done, but took away all the <hi>High Places</hi> and cut down the <hi>Groves</hi> that were in <hi>Judah.</hi> He sent also some of his <hi>Princes</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> throughout all the <hi>Land,</hi> who taking the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> with them, went about throughout all the <hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> to teach the <hi>People</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of GOD, which had been in a great measure disus'd and forgot, during the wicked Reign of some of his <hi>Predecessors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His desire also to enlarge and strengthen his <hi>Kingdom</hi> was extraordinary, and herein he shewed himself a great <hi>King</hi> indeed; who having in the first place endeavoured to settle those things which immediately concern'd the Glory of GOD, and the Spiritual good of his <hi>Subjects;</hi> in the next place took care to maintain the glory of his <hi>Crown,</hi> and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Temporal safety and happiness of his <hi>People.</hi>

                        <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> seeing <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> so great and victorious a <hi>Prince,</hi> was loath to have him for his <hi>Enemy,</hi> tho' the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> contained but the sixth part of that of <hi>Israel,</hi> having only two <hi>Tribes</hi> under it, whereas the Kingdom of <hi>Israel</hi> had Ten; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made an Alliance with him, and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> to accompany him in an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, he intended to make against the King of <hi>Syria;</hi> where <hi>Ahab</hi> was slain, and <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> himself was in great danger; but crying to the <hi>LORD</hi> in his distress, was wonderfully delivered by him. Yet the <hi>LORD</hi> afterwards sent <hi>Jehu</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> to reprove him, for entring into an Alliance with that wicked <hi>King;</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> demanding of him, whether it became him who had been so highly favoured, and blest by <hi>GOD,</hi> to help the ungodly, and love them that hate the <hi>LORD</hi>?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus</hi> GOD <hi>made it appear by the Victorious Successes of this</hi> Prince, <hi>that he takes delight to make them formidable to all their</hi> Enemies <hi>who fear none but him alone; and to honour them that honour him, as well as to make them base and contemptible, who despise and lightly esteem him.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 3107. <hi>before</hi> Christ 897.</note> This Man was owner of a <hi>Vineyard</hi> in <hi>Jezreel,</hi> near to <hi>Ahabs Palace,</hi> which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nur'd and took delight in, as an Inheritance descended to him from his Forefathers: Now <hi>Ahab</hi> designing to enlarge his <hi>Gardens,</hi> desired to have this <hi>Vineyard</hi> of <hi>Naboth,</hi> either paying him the worth of it, or giving him another in exchange. But <hi>Naboth</hi> would by no means part with it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ahab,</hi> notwithstanding that he was despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked, yet thought he had no right to take it by Violence from him; but finding himself unable to overcome <hi>Naboths</hi> Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Refusal caus'd in him so high a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure and vexation, that he fell sick upon it, and refused to eat. <hi>Jezabel</hi> having understood from his own Mouth, the cause of his sadness and distemper, mocked at his simplicity, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>It is a sign you have great Authority over your</hi> Subjects; <hi>when one of them is able to put you into this condition!</hi> And immediately she sent Letters to the chief Men of the <hi>City</hi> where <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi> dwelt, that they should suborn two <hi>false Witnesses,</hi> to depose against <hi>Naboth,</hi> that he had blasphemed <hi>GOD</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they should condemn and stone him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jezabel</hi> being punctually obey'd in all this, the <hi>false Witnesses</hi> were found, and <hi>Naboth</hi> Condemn'd and Ston'd the same day; and News thereof being brought to <hi>Jezabel,</hi> she acquainted <hi>Ahab,</hi> that now he might go and take possession of the <hi>Vineyard</hi> he had so much desired. <hi>Ahab</hi> recovering at this News, goes down to see the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> where <hi>Elijah</hi> meeting him, thunders out this Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: <hi>Thou hast killed</hi> Naboth, <hi>and hast ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken possession; but know, that Dogs shall lick thy</hi> Blood <hi>in the very same place where that Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Man was murther'd; and</hi> Dogs <hi>shall eat the</hi> Flesh <hi>of</hi> Jezabel <hi>by the</hi> Wall <hi>of</hi> Jezreel.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>War</hi> which <hi>Ahab</hi> soon after undertook against <hi>Syria,</hi> gave an accomplishment to this <hi>Prophecy;</hi> for <hi>Ahab</hi> having desired the King of <hi>Judah</hi> to accompany him; <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> desired him to consult some <hi>Prophets</hi> about the event of the <hi>Battel. Ahab</hi> (to comply with his desire) sent for 400 <hi>Prophets</hi> who all with one Mouth promised <hi>Ahab</hi> the Victory; but <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> not satisfied with their <hi>Predictions,</hi> demanded, <hi>Whether there were never a</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>of the LORD there besides, of whom they might enquire? Ahab</hi> answered, <hi>that indeed there was one, but that he hated him, because he always prophesied Evil to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Prophet</hi> was <hi>Micajah,</hi> whom <hi>Ahab</hi> however (at <hi>Jehoshaphats</hi> entreaty) sent for; who being come, boldly declar'd the unhappy Event of the <hi>Battel,</hi> and that <hi>Ahab</hi> should be kill'd in it. <hi>Ahab</hi> provok'd with this <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> caused <hi>Micajah</hi> to be cast into Prison, with design to put him to death at his Return; at which <hi>Micajah</hi> was not at all concern'd, as being assured that he should never return.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ahab</hi> being advanced near to the <hi>Army</hi> of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> put himself into a Disguise; but <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> entred the <hi>Field</hi> in his <hi>Royal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements,</hi> and the King of <hi>Syria</hi> having given order to his <hi>Captains,</hi> to aim chiefly to kill the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> they took <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> for him, and had like to have killed him; for if he had not discover'd himself by his <hi>Speech,</hi> that he was not King <hi>Ahab,</hi> he would have learnt by fatal Experience, how unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a thing it is for a good <hi>Prince</hi> to ally him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with such as are ungodly.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time it hapned, that an <hi>Arrow</hi> shot at a venture reached <hi>Ahab,</hi> and pierced the Joynts of his <hi>Armour;</hi> of which Wound he died that Night.

                  <head>The CONTENTS of the Second Book of the <hi>KINGS,</hi> commonly called the Fourth Book of the <hi>KINGS.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN this <hi>Book</hi> the History of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> is finished, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and carried on in the foregoing Book. As for the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> they and their Subjects continued obstinately wedded to their <hi>Idolatrous Worship;</hi> yet some of them much more than others. Wherefore also they were often called to Repentance by GOD, who to that end made use of the Ministry of his <hi>Prophets,</hi> as well as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere <hi>Judgments</hi> and <hi>Chastisements,</hi> with which he visited them: And as a fore-running presage of their final Ruin, he suffered <hi>Tiglath-Pileser</hi> to lead away the whole <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Neph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thali</hi> Captive into <hi>Assyria;</hi> yet all this had no good effect upon them.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that GOD always reserved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them a small number, according to the Election of <hi>Grace,</hi> to which end the Holy <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Colledges</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> were very conducive: But because the generality of these <hi>Apostate Israelites</hi> presevered in their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and Defection, the LORD in his just Judgment at last wholly rejected and cast them off. For <hi>Salmanasar,</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> having Invaded the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> with a vast <hi>Army,</hi> took <hi>Samaria,</hi> after a three years <hi>Siege,</hi> and carried all the <hi>Israelites</hi> Captive into his own <hi>Country;</hi> which was the final <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> having continued (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Computation of some) <hi>262</hi> years, or thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> also, not very long after, ended much in a like manner: For tho' the <hi>Jews</hi> had the true Worship of <hi>GOD</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally continued amongst them, especially during the <hi>Reigns</hi> of their good and religious <hi>Kings,</hi> and the concurring administration of <hi>holy High Priests,</hi> who diligently employed their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the casting down of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the Reformation and Re-establishment of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship,</hi> when at any time it had suffered any Interruption or Corruption; yet the <hi>People</hi> were either very prone to mix the Leaven of <hi>Superstition</hi> with the pure <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> or to be careless and neglectful in attendance upon it, with that <hi>Zeal, Piety,</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> that <hi>GOD</hi> required of them: And notwithstanding that the serious <hi>Exhortations</hi> and earnest <hi>Admonitions</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as well as the frequent <hi>Chastisements</hi> of the LORD, to recal them to Repentance, were not wanting all this while; yet the abominable Mixtures and Innovations, introduced by them into their <hi>Worship,</hi> and the depravations of their <hi>Manners,</hi> became so great and general, that <hi>GOD</hi> at length deliver'd this corrupt and incorrigible <hi>People</hi> into the hands of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who laid waste and destroyed their <hi>Country,</hi> took the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> burnt the <hi>Temple,</hi> and carried the <hi>Jews</hi> Captives into <hi>Chaldea.</hi> All which came to pass after that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> had consisted (according to the Calculation of some) about <hi>395</hi> years from the <hi>Rent</hi> or <hi>Schism</hi> of the <hi>Ten Tribes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet for all that <hi>GOD</hi> did so moderate his Wrath against this unthankful <hi>People,</hi> that he (notwithstanding all their Provocations and Rebellions) still continued faithful and constant to his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Promise,</hi> and by his Fatherly Goodness, always kept up amongst them an <hi>Elect People,</hi> and preserved the Remains of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>David</hi> (from whence the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to come, according to the Flesh) until the time of his appearing in the <hi>World,</hi> to accomplish the Work of our <hi>Redemption.</hi>

                        <hi>Elisha</hi> being return'd to <hi>Jericho,</hi> the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof represented to him, that the situation of their <hi>City</hi> was very pleasant, but that all the <hi>Water</hi> about it was very bitter, and rendred the <hi>Ground</hi> barren. <hi>Elisha</hi> condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to their desire, bade them bring him a new <hi>Earthen Vessel</hi> with some <hi>Salt</hi> in it, and going forth to the <hi>Spring</hi> of the <hi>Waters,</hi> he cast <hi>Salt</hi> into it, and assured them in the Name of <hi>GOD,</hi> that from thenceforwards the <hi>Waters</hi> should be healed, and be no more the cause of <hi>sickness</hi> or <hi>death</hi> to any, or make the <hi>Ground</hi> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, as formerly they had done.

                        <hi>This</hi> holy Prophet (as S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> observes) <hi>by the efficacy and power of his</hi> Word, <hi>not only changed the bitterness of those</hi> Waters <hi>which flowed upon the</hi> Earth, <hi>but he penetrated to their deepest and most hidden source and</hi> Spring, <hi>where he changed the very Nature of them, and that so throughly and effectually, that the Change he then made, continued to the end of all succeeding Ages, as the</hi> Scripture <hi>observes.

                        <hi>This</hi> (adds that <hi>Father) was an admirable</hi> Figure <hi>of the Renovation and great Change which</hi> Jesus Christ (<hi>represented by the new</hi> Earthen Vessel <hi>fill'd with</hi> Salt) <hi>was to make one day, not in a</hi> City <hi>only or</hi> Country, <hi>but throughout the whole</hi> World, <hi>in scattering his</hi> Salt, <hi>that is to say, his</hi> Apostles, <hi>into the bitter and deadly</hi> Waters; <hi>that is, amongst the</hi> People <hi>corrupted and infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with</hi> Sin; <hi>in order to take away the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the</hi> Ground, <hi>and make it (for time to come) fruitful in all</hi> Vertues <hi>and</hi> Graces.</p>

                     <p>Some time after he with a little <hi>Flower</hi> took away the poysonous quality of a <hi>Pot</hi> of <hi>Pottage,</hi> prepar'd for the Sons of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and multiplied a few <hi>Loaves,</hi> so as they satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a great number of People.</p>
                     <p>But one of the most famous <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by <hi>Elisha,</hi> and which is recorded of him by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> was his curing <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> of his <hi>Leprosie.</hi> This Man was of great Authority with his <hi>Master</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> but was sadly afflicted with that filthy <hi>Disease:</hi> And his <hi>Wife</hi> having a <hi>Jewish Girl</hi> that waited upon her, she told her <hi>Mistress,</hi> that if her <hi>Master</hi> would but go to the <hi>Prophet Elisha</hi> in <hi>Samaria,</hi> he would cure him of his <hi>Leprosie. Naaman</hi> being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herewith, told the <hi>King</hi> his Master, who sent a <hi>Letter</hi> by him to <hi>Joram</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> importing that he had sent his <hi>General Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to him to be cured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joram</hi> looking upon this his unreasonable Request, only as a design to pick a Quarrel with him, rent his <hi>Cloaths,</hi> asking <hi>Naaman, Whether his Master took him for a</hi> GOD, <hi>thus to require him to Cure his Disease? Elisha</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding what had past, sent to the <hi>King,</hi> to bid him direct <hi>Naaman</hi> to him, that he might know there was a <hi>Prophet</hi> in <hi>Israel.</hi> So <hi>Naaman</hi> came with his <hi>Horses</hi> and <hi>Chariot,</hi> and stood before the Door of <hi>Elisha</hi>'s <hi>House,</hi> who without going out to him, sent word by his <hi>Servant, That he should go and wash himself seven times in the River</hi> Jordan, <hi>by which means he should be healed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Naaman</hi> being in a rage at this usage and message of <hi>Elisha,</hi> went his way; but his <hi>Servants</hi> representing to him, how easie the thing was which the <hi>Prophet</hi> had prescrib'd for his Cure, desired him by all means to try, whether the <hi>Prophet</hi> had spoken true? <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> at last yielding to their Reasons, went and plunged himself seven times in <hi>Jordan;</hi> whereupon his Flesh came again as the flesh of a little Child. As soon as <hi>Naaman</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Cure wrought upon him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with all his Company to <hi>Elisha,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his Acknowledgment, and to assure him, that from thence forward he would worship no other <hi>GOD,</hi> but the <hi>LORD</hi> only; he prest him also to receive his <hi>Presents,</hi> but <hi>Elisha</hi> utterly refused.</p>
                     <p>Now after <hi>Naaman</hi> was departed, <hi>Gehazi, (Elisha</hi>'s <hi>Servant</hi>) ran after him, and telling him a Lye, procur'd of him two <hi>Talents</hi> of <hi>Silver</hi> and two Changes of <hi>Rayment. Elisha</hi> knowing what had past, reproached <hi>Gehazi</hi> for his <hi>Covetousness,</hi> and told him in the Name of the <hi>LORD, That because he had done this, the</hi> Leprosie <hi>of</hi> Naaman <hi>the</hi> Syrian <hi>should cleave to him, and to his Seed for ever,</hi> which hapned accordingly, and the <hi>Leprosie</hi> immediately appeared over all his whole Body as white as <hi>Snow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Cure <hi>of this</hi> General (saith S. <hi>Ambrose) is a</hi> Figure <hi>of the purification of</hi> Christians, <hi>of their inward</hi> Leprosie, <hi>by the</hi> Laver <hi>of</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. <hi>The Prophet</hi> Elisha <hi>would receive nothing in consideration of this</hi> Cure, <hi>to teach the</hi> Ministers <hi>of the</hi> Gospel <hi>by his Example, to part with and communicate freely to others, what they have so freely receiv'd themselves from the</hi> Author <hi>and</hi> Fountain <hi>of all good.

                     <p>THE <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> having several times laid wait with his <hi>Army,</hi> to surprize <hi>Joram</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 3116. <hi>before</hi> Christ 888.</note> but all to no purpose, he became transported into a great Rage against his <hi>chief Officers</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> as supposing that they disclosed his Designs to him: But one of them told him, <hi>He was much mistaken to suspect the Faithfulness of his</hi> Servants <hi>upon that account;</hi> and assured him, <hi>That it was</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha <hi>the</hi> Prophet <hi>that frustrated his Designs, by acquainting the King of</hi> Israel <hi>with his most secret Counsels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As soon as the King of <hi>Syria</hi> had understood this, he was as much enraged against <hi>Elisha,</hi> as before he had been against his <hi>Servants,</hi> and resolved to seize him; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he sent a great Party of his <hi>Forces</hi> to surround the <hi>City</hi> where <hi>Elisha</hi> then was. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha</hi>'s Servant arising in the Morning, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Syrians,</hi> that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested the <hi>City,</hi> he was sore afraid; but <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha,</hi> to rid him of his Apprehensions, <hi>prayed</hi> to <hi>GOD</hi> to open his <hi>Eyes;</hi> whereupon the young Man saw an <hi>Angelical Guard</hi> of <hi>Horses</hi> and <hi>Chariots of Fire,</hi> surrounding and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Master.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And at the same time <hi>Elisha</hi> entreated <hi>GOD</hi> to strike the <hi>Syrian Army</hi> with <hi>blindness,</hi> that were come to take him; which the <hi>LORD</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving performed at the request of his Servant, <hi>Elisha</hi> went down to them, and told them, <hi>That they had mistaken their way; but if they would follow him, he would lead them to the Man they look'd for;</hi> and so brought them into the midst of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and then prayed <hi>GOD</hi> to open their <hi>Eyes</hi> again, that they might see the danger in which they were..</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Joram</hi> seeing his <hi>Enemies</hi> thus mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously made his <hi>Prisoners,</hi> demanded of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha,</hi> whether he should destroy them, since <hi>GOD</hi> had delivered them into his hand? but the <hi>Prophet</hi> check'd him for entertaining such a Thought, and on the contrary bade him set <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> before them, and send them back to their <hi>Master</hi> in Peace.</p>
                     <p>Not long after this, <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of <hi>Syria</hi> raised a prodigious <hi>Army,</hi> and with it besieged the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> which thereby was reduced to so dreadful a <hi>Famin,</hi> that an <hi>Asses-Head</hi> was sold for 80 <hi>Shekels,</hi> that is, for about 12 pounds sterling. But the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> gives us a more tragical Instance of the extream <hi>Famin</hi> then raging in that <hi>City,</hi> Which is this, <hi>As King</hi> Joram <hi>was walking on the</hi> Wall, <hi>a</hi> Woman <hi>cries out to him to do her</hi> Justice; <hi>and the King asking her what she desired of him, she told him, that she and another</hi> Woman <hi>(her Neighbour) had agreed to kill their</hi> Children <hi>and eat them; that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly she had given her</hi> Son, <hi>and they had eaten him; but that her Neighbour instead of dressing her</hi> Son <hi>the next day, according to their Contract, had hid him, and would not deliver him.</hi>

                     <p>King <hi>Joram</hi> astonished at the recital of so barbarous and unheard of Cruelty, rent his <hi>Cloaths,</hi> whereby the <hi>Sackcloth</hi> he wore next to his <hi>Skin</hi> was seen; but however, instead of reflecting upon his <hi>Sins,</hi> which were the cause of so dreadful a <hi>Judgment</hi> upon him and his People, he turns his Rage against <hi>Elisha,</hi> and swore he would have his <hi>Head</hi> that very day, and accordingly sent an <hi>Officer</hi> to his <hi>House,</hi> to execute his wicked design: But <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha</hi> knowing of his Messag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>This behaviour of the</hi> King <hi>of</hi> Israel <hi>shews, how dangerous a thing it is, for a Man in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, to give himself up to</hi> Anger <hi>and</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience. <hi>We see this</hi> Prince <hi>here dreadfully afflicted, and wearing</hi> Sackcloth <hi>upon his</hi> Skin, <hi>which one would think was a great sign of his being sensible of the Hand of</hi> GOD <hi>upon his</hi> Capital City; <hi>but for all that, we find him very far from being either humble or truly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; for losing his Confidence in</hi> GOD, <hi>and abandoning himself to Despair, he resolves to murther him, who alone by his Holiness and great Interest in</hi> GOD, <hi>was the Instrument of saving that</hi> City <hi>from utter ruin.

                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 3119. <hi>before Christ</hi> 885.</note> the <hi>holy Prophet</hi> comforted him and the People, who were quite spent and faint, assuring them, <hi>That the next day about that time, fine</hi> Flour <hi>and</hi> Barley <hi>should be as cheap as then it was dear and scarce,</hi> 'Twas a hard thing to believe this <hi>Prophesie,</hi> because all Ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jects of Sense did directly contradict it; and one of the <hi>Lords</hi> that were with the <hi>King</hi> was so bold to tell him, <hi>That what he had said could not prove true, except</hi> GOD <hi>should be pleased to open the Windows of</hi> Heaven, <hi>and rain down</hi> Corn <hi>upon them.</hi> But the <hi>Prophet</hi> replyed, <hi>He should see it with his</hi> Eyes, <hi>but should not eat of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Prophesie</hi> was verified in this manner: Four <hi>Leprous Persons</hi> being got out of the <hi>City,</hi> encouraged one another to go into the <hi>Camp</hi> of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and deliver themselves to them, as knowing that the worst that could happen to them was to be killed by them, which they thought far more eligible than to pine away with <hi>Famine;</hi> but when they were come to the <hi>Camp,</hi> they were extreamly surpriz'd to find no body there; for <hi>GOD</hi> had struck the <hi>Syrian Army</hi> with Terror, by making them hear a noise of <hi>Chariots</hi> and <hi>Horses,</hi> as the noise of a great <hi>Army;</hi> whereupon they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themselves to flight for their <hi>Lives,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their <hi>Tents, Horses,</hi> and all their <hi>Baggage</hi> behind them.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>As soon as these <hi>Messengers</hi> had made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the <hi>King</hi> of what they had seen, and that the <hi>Enemy</hi> was certainly returned home, the almost starv'd <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Samaria</hi> flock'd in crowds out of the <hi>City,</hi> to go and plunder the <hi>Tents</hi> of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> by which means <hi>Meal</hi> and <hi>Barley</hi> was sold in the <hi>City</hi> at the same price <hi>Elisha</hi> had foretold to the <hi>King,</hi> in the Name of the <hi>LORD.</hi> And about the same time the other part of his <hi>Prophecy</hi> was fulfill'd likewise; for the <hi>King</hi> having commanded the <hi>Lord,</hi> who had expressed his disbelief of what <hi>Elisha</hi> had pronounced to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People</hi> in the Name of <hi>GOD,</hi> to have charge of the <hi>Gate,</hi> to prevent any Disorders that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen on that occasion, he was trod under foot by the People, and died.</p>

                     <p>After <hi>Jehoram's</hi> Death, his Son <hi>Ahaziah</hi> succeeded in the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> and was Contemporary with <hi>Joram</hi> the Son of <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> whom he assisted in the <hi>War</hi> he waged against <hi>Hazael</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Joram</hi> being wounded in the <hi>Fight,</hi> he went to <hi>Jezreel</hi> to be cured, whither <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> repaired to give him a Visit.

                     <p>When <hi>Athaliah</hi> had now reigned 7 years, <hi>Jehojada</hi> the <hi>High Priest</hi> thought it was high time to declare to all <hi>Judah, That they had a lawful</hi> King <hi>in being, whom</hi> Athaliah <hi>had now for so many years deprived of his Right, by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surping the Crown of</hi> Judah; <hi>and having over and above contrived his Death, but that she had been happily prevented in the execution of her wicked and treasonous Design.</hi> And having sent for the <hi>high Officers of</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Army,</hi> to meet him in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> he shewed them <hi>Joash</hi> their lawful <hi>Sovereign,</hi> whom they with most joyful Acclamations proclaimed <hi>King.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Athaliah</hi> surprized with these extraordinary shouts of Joy proceeding from the <hi>Temple,</hi> ran in haste thither, and rushing into the place where the <hi>King</hi> was, <hi>Jehojada</hi> commanded the <hi>Officers</hi> to seize her, and having dragg'd her out of the <hi>Temple</hi> to kill her; which being executed accordingly, <hi>Joash</hi> (who was then but 7 years of Age) peacefully succeeded in his <hi>Father's Throne.</hi>

                     <p>About the same time <hi>Elisha</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> died: and as he lay upon his <hi>Death-bed, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ash,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> came to give him a visit, and to testifie the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he had conceived at the apprehension of losing the best Bulwark of his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Prophet</hi> to recompence this his good Office, promis'd him as many Victories against the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> as he should give strokes to the Ground. <hi>Elisha</hi> died soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it hapned that as some Persons were burying a <hi>dead Body,</hi> they discovered a Party of <hi>Moabites</hi> that were ravaging the <hi>Country;</hi> whereupon they in haste cast the <hi>dead Body</hi> into <hi>Elisha's Grave,</hi> which as soon as it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Bones</hi> of that <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> was restored to Life.</p>

                        <p>King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> being Sick to Death, is restored to <hi>Health,</hi> and has <hi>15 Years</hi> added to his Life.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOT long after that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was thus miraculously deliver'd from <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s <hi>Army,</hi> he fell Sick of a <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal disease.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Before Jesus Christ 710 years.</note> 
                        <hi>GOD,</hi> it seems was resolved to try this pious K. all manner of ways thereby to raise <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Faith, and to display his own Power and Glory. Accordingly, after that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly besought the <hi>LORD, GOD</hi> sent <hi>Isaiah</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> (who had before declar'd the Sentence of <hi>Death</hi> to him) to assure him that the <hi>LORD</hi> had heard his <hi>Prayer,</hi> and retracted the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>death;</hi> That his Recovery should be so sudden, that within 3 days he should be in condition to go to the Temple of the LORD; and moreover that 15 years should be added to the years of his Life. And to convince <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> of the Truth of what he had declar'd to him in the Name of the LORD, he wrought a famous <hi>Miracle,</hi> by making the shadow of the Sun to return backward ten Degrees upon the Dial of <hi>Ahez.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So many <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought in favour of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> did not meet with the answerable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that might be expected from them; and he made it appear, when he was restored to health, that it is sometimes advantageous for <hi>Good Men</hi> to die of their <hi>Sickness. GOD,</hi> to make the <hi>Pride</hi> that had insinuated it self into <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s <hi>Heart</hi> to appear abroad, suffer'd the Ambassadors of the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> to come to him with rich Presents, to congratulate his Recovery, and to enquire about the <hi>Miracle</hi> wrought in his behalf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pleasing himself with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done to him by that great King, shewed his <hi>Ambassadors</hi> all his <hi>Riches, Jewels</hi> and <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,</hi> and all that was Great and Magnificent in all his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> with all his stores of <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Ammunition.</hi> GOD, who had discover'd this Wound hid in the bottom of the King's Heart, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Whereupon <hi>Isaiah</hi> declared to him in the Name of GOD, That all the <hi>Treasures</hi> that he had shewed to the <hi>Babylonian Ambassadors,</hi> should be carried to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that his own <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Posterity</hi> should be <hi>Eunuchs</hi> in the <hi>Palace</hi> of the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Which <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> was afterwards verified in the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Blood Royal</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> who were carried away <hi>Captives</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.

                        </gap>e Son of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who was but 12 years of Age, when he began to Reign, was himself carried Captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> because of his Impiety, wherein he exceeded all the Kings that went before him. He set up again whatever his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had destroyed, and pull'd down whatever he had set up. He caus'd the <hi>Prophet Isaiah</hi> to be kill'd, without respecting his Holiness, his high Quality, being Prince of the Blood, or his great Age, being above 100 years old, and out-did (as GOD witnesseth of him by his <hi>Prophets</hi>) all the Abominations of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> whom GOD had driven our of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore also GOD raised up against him the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> who took him Captive, and bound him with <hi>Chains</hi> and carried him to <hi>Babylon.</hi> This sad condition, to which by the just <hi>Judgment</hi> of GOD he was reduced, made him enter into himself, and Eying GOD, who so justly chastiz'd him, he beg'd for Pardon and Mercy with all his Heart, and gave full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a true and sincere Repentance.</p>
                     <p>These deep and hearty Humiliations of this Captive Prince, joyn'd with most ardent <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> mov'd GOD to have pity on him; and delivering him from his <hi>Captivity</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> he restor'd him to his Subjects, and establish'd him in his Throne, where now his care was to serve the LORD, and to shew himself thankful for the great <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Loving-kindness</hi> he had been pleased to show unto him. Neither was he content with serving the LORD himself, but he commanded all his Subjects to serve the <hi>Lord God</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to worship him alone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus</hi> (saith the Scripture) Manasseh <hi>knew that the LORD he was GOD;</hi> and indeed every one who read these wonderful Events cannot but own the same. And it is hard to determine where we ought to fix our <hi>Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> most, whether on the <hi>Omnipotence</hi> of GOD; who absolutely disposes of <hi>Men,</hi> or on his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> which does not spare Kings; or on his <hi>Mercy,</hi> which condescends to be entreated by so great a <hi>Criminal,</hi> and restores a <hi>Prince</hi> to his <hi>Throne,</hi> who had so outrageously <hi>contemn'd</hi> his <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>profan'd</hi> his <hi>Temple.</hi>

                  <p>That which we assert here, That these <hi>Books</hi> were compiled from the <hi>Writings</hi> of the Ancient <hi>Prophets,</hi> appears evidently from the <hi>Clause</hi> we meet with so often in them, that the rest of such <hi>Actions</hi> or <hi>Events</hi> are written in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Gad,</hi> of <hi>Iddo,</hi> of <hi>Isaiah, &amp;c.</hi> tho' it seem also very probable, that some of these <hi>Books</hi> so quoted, be no other than the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Samuel</hi> and of <hi>Kings,</hi> as having been succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively continued and carried on from time to time by divers <hi>Prophets.</hi>

Besides, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the <hi>Promised Messiah</hi> was to be Born according to the <hi>Flesh,</hi> not only of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> but in particular of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity</hi> and <hi>House of David;</hi> therefore <hi>Esdras</hi> thought fit to set down the <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> of his <hi>Ancestors,</hi> deducing it to his very <hi>Person,</hi> in order to make it more visibly appear, that the <hi>Promises</hi> of GOD are true.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore as the <hi>former Book</hi> gave us a view of many <hi>Particulars</hi> concerning the Reign of <hi>David;</hi> so this begins with the Reign of <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son, who succeeded him in the <hi>Throne.</hi> He was a <hi>Prince</hi> favour'd by GOD with great <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which he had requested of him; besides which, <hi>GOD</hi> was pleased to confer upon him vast <hi>Riches,</hi> which he employed in Building of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and other of his <hi>Royal Structures,</hi> and great <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> being Admir'd and Rever'd by all the <hi>Kings</hi> about him. Who notwithstanding, because of his <hi>Sins,</hi> his <hi>Kingdom</hi> was divided, soon after his Son <hi>Rehoboam</hi> came to possess the <hi>Crown;</hi> for the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> separating themselves from <hi>Judah,</hi> made <hi>Jeroboam</hi> their King.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Rehoboam</hi> there descended in a Right <hi>Line</hi> the following Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> viz. <hi>Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, Ahaziah, Joash, Amaziah, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon, Josiah, Jehoahaz, Jehojakim, Jehojakin, Zedekiah;</hi> some of whom were <hi>Idolaters;</hi> but others restored the True Worship of GOD, as <hi>Asa, Jehoshaphat, Joash, Amaziah, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah, Jotham, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Josiah;</hi> tho amongst all these also there was a great difference with respect to the fervour of their <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>sincere Godliness.</hi> Yea, some of these <hi>Kings</hi> by a slackening of their <hi>Zeal,</hi> turned from <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>Evil,</hi> as <hi>Joash</hi> and <hi>Amaziah;</hi> and some others, as <hi>Manasseh,</hi> repented of the <hi>Evils</hi> they had committed and became <hi>Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the <hi>LORD</hi> was not wanting to invite and sollicite them, to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend</hi> their <hi>Lives,</hi> as well the <hi>Kings</hi> as the <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> making use to that end of the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who during all this time followed one another in considerable numbers, from <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha</hi> until <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel;</hi> yet because they were not minded by the greater part, but rather Mocked, Abused, and Persecuted by them, GOD permitted at last the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> to be conquer'd and possest by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who carried the <hi>Jews</hi> Captives into his own <hi>Country,</hi> where they continued 70 years, until <hi>Cyrus</hi> (under whom the <hi>Monarchy</hi> was transported from the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to the <hi>Persians</hi>) gave them leave to return to their own <hi>Country;</hi> an account whereof we find in the two following Books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that (according to the <hi>Calculation</hi> of some) this <hi>Book</hi> contains the <hi>History</hi> of 424 years, to which if we add the 70 years of the <hi>Captivity</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> we shall find the Account of 494 years, from the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Solomon</hi> to the First year of the Reign of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia;</hi> tho' some account no more than 484, and from the <hi>Creation</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> to the Return of the <hi>Captivity</hi> 3468 years.</p>

                  <p>Some time after this, when the <hi>Jews</hi> fell to a remisness and neglect of the <hi>Worship of GOD, Ezra</hi> the <hi>Priest,</hi> by a special Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> was (at his Request) sent by <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> in the <hi>Seventh year</hi> of his Reign, with a considerable number of his <hi>Country-men,</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> being liberally assisted by Order of the <hi>King,</hi> with whatsoever was requisite or needful for his <hi>Journey,</hi> with intention to settle and regulate all things according to the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Divine Ordinances</hi> prescribed by <hi>GOD.</hi> All which <hi>Ezra,</hi> upon his arrival at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with a great Zeal most punctually and faithfully performed: Wherefore there is good reason why this Book is called by his Name, as being not only the <hi>Pen-man</hi> of it; but because it, in a manner, wholly treats of what he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for the <hi>Glory of GOD,</hi> and the <hi>Good of his Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Calculation of <hi>Time,</hi> the Learned <hi>Chronologists</hi> do not altogether agree about it, because the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Years</hi> of the <hi>Persian Monarchy,</hi> are not computed by all after the same manner, the <hi>Learned</hi> differing in their <hi>Opinions</hi> about the <hi>Four Persian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies</hi> that followed after <hi>Cyrus;</hi> to Wit, <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes the First,</hi> during whose Reign the <hi>Building of the Temple</hi> was put by and hindred; <hi>Darius,</hi> under whom the <hi>Temple</hi> was finished, and <hi>Artaxerxes the Second,</hi> who first sent <hi>Ezra</hi> to settle and order all things according to the <hi>Divine Law;</hi> and afterwards <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to rebuild the <hi>Walls, Gates,</hi> and whole <hi>City of Jerusalem.</hi> However, thus much is certain, and without dispute, that all these things hapned under the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the <hi>Persians,</hi> which began with <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and that this <hi>History</hi> begins with the <hi>First year</hi> of his Reign in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and is continued to the <hi>Seventh year</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes the Second,</hi> or a little farther; as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>History of Nehemiah</hi> begins with the <hi>Twentieth year</hi> of the same <hi>King.</hi>

                     <p>After some time spent in setling themselves there, in the 7th <hi>Month</hi> they assembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where they began to build an <hi>Altar,</hi> and to offer <hi>Burnt-offerings</hi> to the <hi>LORD;</hi> and the next year began to lay the Foundations of the <hi>Temple;</hi> which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with great Solemnity.

                     <p>But some of the Neighbours of the <hi>Jews</hi> were much displeased to see them returned to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and carrying on the <hi>Building</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> with so much success; and at length (by slandering and mis-representing their designs to the <hi>Court</hi>) caused the Work to be hindred during the term of 16 years, till the 2<hi>d</hi> year of the Reign of <hi>Darius Hystaspes;</hi> at which time <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachariah</hi> the Prophets, having exhorted the <hi>Jews</hi> to fall to Building again, they did so without regarding the Threats of their <hi>Enemies;</hi> King <hi>Darius</hi> himself having given order for the carrying on of the <hi>Building</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences necessary for the <hi>Work;</hi> which was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and furnish'd.

                     <p>But as <hi>Ezra</hi> then roundly declared to the <hi>Jews, that they could not continue the</hi> People <hi>of</hi> GOD <hi>without utterly renouncing these</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances <hi>with</hi> Idolatrous Women: So <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ought well to weigh the import of that <hi>Oracle</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which assures us, <hi>That we cannot serve two Masters: That</hi> GOD <hi>is a Jealous</hi> GOD, who will suffer no <hi>Rivals;</hi> and either wholly possess the <hi>Heart of Man,</hi> or not at all.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>holy Man,</hi> informing himself very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the state of that <hi>City,</hi> was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieved to understand by those that came from them, that the <hi>Walls</hi> thereof did lie in Ruinous heaps, and the <hi>Gates</hi> burnt down, in the same condition to which they were reduc'd by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> at his taking of that <hi>City.</hi> This News so sensibly affected <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that he could not keep his secret Grief from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such impressions on his <hi>Countenance</hi> as were soon perceiv'd by the King, as he was waiting on him at <hi>Table,</hi> in quality of his <hi>Cupbearer:</hi> who demanding of him the cause of his <hi>Sorrow</hi>? He told him, it was by reason of the ruin and desolation of his <hi>Birth-place, Jerusalem;</hi> and humbly desir'd him, to give him leave to go and rebuild the <hi>Walls</hi> and <hi>Towers,</hi> and raise up the <hi>Gates</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>The King having heard his request, freely granted it, but <hi>Nehemiah</hi> being a Person whom he had a Kindness for, he asked him, how long he must be absent?

                     <p>As soon as the <hi>Chief Men</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> had heard this, they shewed themselves very ready and unanimous to set upon the <hi>Work;</hi> and dividing themselves into several <hi>Companies,</hi> whereof each took upon them to <hi>rebuild</hi> a certain part of the <hi>Wall</hi> with the greatest vigour and heat imaginable. But the Adversaries of the <hi>Jews</hi> were very much troubled to see the <hi>Work</hi> advance so fast, and <hi>Sanballat</hi> (who was the Head of them) stirred up the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and other <hi>Neighbouring</hi> People, to hinder and put a stop to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> tho he was extreamly troubled to meet with this opposition, yet did he not at all lose his Courage, but opposed his Vigilance against their privy <hi>Conspiracies,</hi> and Force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their open <hi>Violence.</hi> He charg'd the <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> to be always in a readiness to oppose the <hi>Enemy,</hi> and order'd all the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers</hi> and <hi>Builders</hi> to have their <hi>Swords</hi> by their sides, and as they wrought with one hand, to hold a <hi>Weapon</hi> in the other, to the end they might always be in a readiness to obstruct and fight those that should come to disturb them in their <hi>Work.</hi> And by means of this his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diligence and application he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd his undertaking, and compleated the building of the <hi>Walls</hi> and <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

This Refusal, which was not the effect of Pride, as <hi>Human</hi> conceiv'd it to be, but rather of <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Piety, did not only bring upon himself, but upon all the <hi>Jews,</hi> the cruel Sentence of <hi>Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this proud <hi>Favourite</hi> not contented with <hi>Sacrificing Mordecai</hi> to his Revenge, who had offended him, was resolved to make the whole <hi>Nation</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> to fall a Victim to his rage; to which purpose he represented them to the King as a <hi>Seditious</hi> People, who being tied up to a distinct <hi>Religion</hi> from all other <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> were always fomenting <hi>Seditions</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions</hi> in all places where they lived.</p>
                     <p>This Credulous Prince, without any farther enquiring into the matter, gave credit to this Impostor, and gave him leave upon this his Remonstrance, to draw up a Declaration, such as he thought good, containing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Command to all his <hi>Subjects,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his whole Kingdom, on a certain day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, to kill all the <hi>Jews, Men</hi> and <hi>Women, Old Men</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> without sparing any.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Esther,</hi> the Niece of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who by a particular Providence of GOD was raised to be <hi>Ahasuerus</hi>'s <hi>Queen</hi> instead of <hi>Vashti,</hi> whom he had Divorced, was very sensibly afflicted at this dreadful Calamity which was ready to involve all her People, tho' she her self were not in danger; because <hi>Mordecai</hi> her Uncle, whose wise Counsel she followed in all things, had always advis'd her to conceal her being a <hi>Jewess.</hi> As she therefore was casting about to find out some Remedy for this great Evil; <hi>Mordecai</hi> advis'd her to go and present her self before the <hi>King,</hi> to represent to him the horrid Injustice of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> he had given <hi>Haman</hi> leave to publish in his Name.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Esther</hi> told <hi>Morcedai,</hi> That this would be the way to expose her self to <hi>Death,</hi> which was unavoidable to those, who presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before the King, without being sent for by him. <hi>Mordecai</hi> replyed, That she could not with Reason suppose that she should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape in this <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niversal Calamity,</hi> wherein their whole Nation were involved, by being in the Kings Palace; and that if her Fear should stop her Mouth in this time of extremity, GOD would find some other way to deliver his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the destruction that threatned them, but that she and her Fathers House should pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; adding, that probably for this very Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice GOD had raised her to the Throne.</p>

The Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Throne and the Magnificence of his <hi>Ornaments,</hi> but above all, something of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> that appear'd in his Looks, made <hi>Esther</hi> to fall down in a Swound; and GOD having changed the Kings heart at the same time, he came down from his Throne to raise her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and as he and all his Great Officers were comforting of her, as soon as she had recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Speech, she said to the King,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I thought my Lord the King, when I looked upon you, that I had seen an Angel, and the Glory that surrounds and attends you overcame my Heart, and made me faint for fear.</hi> But falling a second time down for dead, the <hi>King</hi> was exceedingly concerned for her, and as soon as she was come to her self again, he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her, What was her desire? assuring her, he would deny her nothing as far as the half of his Kingdom.

Who replying, that he had not receiv'd any. <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> asked again, whether there were any Person in the <hi>Anti-chamber</hi>? And the <hi>Kings Servants</hi> having answered him, That <hi>Haman</hi> was there; for he was come very early that <hi>Morning,</hi> to desire an Order from the <hi>King</hi> to hang <hi>Mordecai</hi> on a <hi>Gallows</hi> of 50 <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits</hi> high, he had prepared for him; the <hi>King</hi> commanded his <hi>Servants</hi> to bid him come in.</p>
                     <p>As soon as <hi>Haman</hi> was entr'd, the King ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him what he thought fit should be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Man whom the King delighted to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; <hi>Haman</hi> presently imagining, that he was the Person the <hi>King</hi> spoke of, and whom he did intend to honour; answered the <hi>King, That the highest honour that could be put upon any Person, was to aray him in the</hi> Royal Robes, <hi>to set him upon the</hi> Kings Horse, <hi>with the</hi> Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Diadem <hi>upon his Head, and that one of the most noble</hi> Princes <hi>about the</hi> King <hi>should lead him through all the Chief Streets of the</hi> City, <hi>holding his</hi> Horse <hi>by the Reins, and proclaiming before him,</hi> Thus shall it be done to the Man whom the King delights to honour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Haman</hi> had no sooner given this Answer to the <hi>King</hi>'s Question, but he commanded him to make haste to execute the Advice he had given him, and to take the <hi>Royal Apparel, Crown</hi> and <hi>Horse,</hi> and do to <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> as he had spoken. Thus the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Shushan</hi> were Eye witnesses of the sudden and unexpected Change in the conditions of these two Persons; they saw humble <hi>Mordecai</hi> receiving the highest marks of Honour and Glory, by the advice and ministry of <hi>Haman,</hi> who was his sworn and most deadly <hi>Enemy;</hi> and at the same time saw proud and superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious <hi>Haman</hi> forced to publish and proclaim the Glory of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and to stoop and bow before him, whom he disdain'd and hated in his Heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Haman</hi> having thus been forc'd to submit to this most unwelcome piece of Service done to his <hi>Enemy,</hi> was extreamly troubled thereat, and returning to his own <hi>House</hi> in a Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition, and with his <hi>Head</hi> cover'd, he complain'd of his mis-hap to his <hi>Wife,</hi> and other of his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Counsellors,</hi> who looking upon this Disgrace that had befallen him as a bad <hi>Omen,</hi> told him plainly, That they feared that <hi>Mordecai</hi> (who had already been an occasion of his Disgrace) would at last prove his utter ruin; for whereas <hi>Mordecai</hi> was one of that <hi>Nation,</hi> whom he had resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed utterly to destroy and root them out from off the <hi>Earth,</hi> and that he had been forced sore against his Will, to confer those Honours upon him he had design'd for himself, they could not but take it as a sign, that the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief he intended for <hi>Mordecai</hi> and all the <hi>Jews,</hi> would light upon his own Head.</p>
                     <p>The sequel of this Story makes it appear, that they were not at all deceived in this their Conjecture, and that tho' God suffers some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that <hi>Injustice</hi> arm'd with <hi>Violence</hi> seems ready to oppress and overwhelm those, who fear and trust in none but himself, like <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai;</hi> yet he knows also in due time to make them experience his defence and protection when the Hour of their Danger is come, and to deliver them from the distress to which they were exposed for no other Reason, but because they were faithful to him, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Displeasure more than the Rage of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men, whose Hatred, tho it be very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, yet it is also very weak and impotent, without the Divine Permission, who sets bounds to the raging <hi>Sea</hi> of Mens Passions, saying thus far ye shall come and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

But the <hi>King</hi> entring at the same time into the <hi>Chamber</hi> as <hi>Haman</hi> was in this posture, became exceedingly enrag'd at him, as if he would have Forc'd the <hi>Queen</hi> in his presence, and immediately commanded him to be put to Death. But as the Divine Wisdom confounding the <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> of Men, doth always observe a great proportion betwixt <hi>Crimes</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> one of the <hi>Officers</hi> that was present told the King, that there was a <hi>Gallows</hi> ready (50 <hi>Cubits</hi> high) which <hi>Haman</hi> had caused to be set up with design to hang <hi>Mordecai</hi> thereon, who had done great Service to the <hi>King;</hi> whereupon the <hi>King</hi> commanded them immediately to hang <hi>Haman</hi> thereon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Notwithstanding (saith St. <hi>Ambrose</hi>) that the Authority of this <hi>Prince</hi> was already so far engag'd against the <hi>Jews</hi> for their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that he could not recal the same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some blemish to the <hi>Royal Power;</hi> yet did not he esteem it any dishonour publickly to acknowledge, that an ambitious <hi>Minister</hi> had impos'd upon him and abus'd his <hi>Royal Favour</hi> to base and cruel ends; and instead of going thro with a barbarous violence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was already engaged in it, and his <hi>Royal Seal</hi> put to it, he reversed the <hi>Orders</hi> he had given, as soon as he understood the Injustice of them. And turning his just In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation against those who had so wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly abus'd his Power, and who made use of the easie Access they had to his Person, only as a means to ruin those, as their Enemies, whom the Zeal of GOD, and the Reverence they had for his <hi>Laws,</hi> kept within the bounds of their Duty, not suffering them to give that Honour to <hi>Men,</hi> which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived due to GOD alone.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Accordingly <hi>King Ahasuerus</hi> publishing an <hi>Edict</hi> quite contrary to his former (which was the contrivance of <hi>Haman,</hi>) publickly own'd the esteem he had for the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had been falsely represented to him as a Rebellious and Factious People, and impower'd them to set upon those who should dare to attempt any thing against them. Thus by the Death of one Man was so great an Evil prevented, and Peace and Quiet established throughout all the Dominions of <hi>King Ahasuerus;</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of that wicked and insolent <hi>Favorite,</hi> took <hi>Mordecai</hi> (a wise Man and fearing <hi>GOD</hi>) to be his <hi>Chief Minister</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> which gave the <hi>Jews</hi> so great an Authority every where, that as the <hi>Scripture</hi> observes) many of the People of that Land turned to be of their <hi>Religion.</hi>

                        <hi>'Tis evident from this</hi> History, <hi>that the</hi> Heart <hi>of</hi> Kings <hi>is in the hand of GOD, who by this</hi> Book <hi>teaches them,</hi> That they must bear the burthen of the <hi>Crown</hi> themselves and see with their own <hi>Eyes;</hi> for fear lest leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Authority to others, they should meet with those who abuse it, like <hi>Haman,</hi> to satisfie their own Passions and corrupt Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, to the prejudice of <hi>Justice,</hi> and of their <hi>Princes</hi> Credit and Reputation.</p>

                  <head>The CONTENTS of the Book of JOB.</head>
                  <p>THis <hi>Book</hi> is called the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>JOB,</hi> a very Famous and <hi>Holy Man,</hi> whose most memorable <hi>History</hi> is here recorded, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an account of his great <hi>Trials,</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible <hi>Patience,</hi> his unmoveable <hi>Faith,</hi> and the happy end of all his <hi>Afflictions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some suppose, that this <hi>Job</hi> flourished in the time of the <hi>Patriarchs.</hi> Others, whilst the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> were yet in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or at least, whilst they were Travelling through the <hi>Wilderness</hi> to the <hi>Land of Canaan,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Moses,</hi> who (by some) is supposed to have been the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Pen-man</hi> of this <hi>Book;</hi> the <hi>Historical</hi> part whereof in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Original,</hi> is set down in <hi>Prose;</hi> but the <hi>Discourses</hi> therein contained, are expressed in <hi>Heroick Verse,</hi> suitable to the <hi>gravity</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of the <hi>Subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Book</hi> begins with a description of <hi>Job</hi>'s extraordinary <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Uprightness,</hi> and of the happy and flourishing state of his <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> which is followed with the sad and lamentable relation of divers <hi>dreadful Calamities,</hi> which by the instigation of <hi>Satan,</hi> and wise dispensation and permission of the LORD, suddenly and unexpectedly fell upon him in his <hi>Estate,</hi> his <hi>Children,</hi> and his own <hi>Body,</hi> besides the <hi>reproaches</hi> and <hi>insultings</hi> of his <hi>Wife.</hi> In all which he gave the highest Marks of a most <hi>Heroick Patience,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of desponding, like the inflexible <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> hardned and raised it self under the heavy Load of these <hi>extreme Afflictions,</hi> silently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescing in the <hi>Will of GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being in this most deplorable Condition, he is visited by <hi>Three of his Friends,</hi> Great and Famous <hi>Men,</hi> to condole with and comfort him. At their first seeing of him, they sit down by him in silence, not speaking a word, as <hi>Men</hi> transported and overcome with the terrour of his <hi>Calamities,</hi> and the bitterness of his <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi> But <hi>Job</hi> at last, by the Infirmity of his <hi>Flesh,</hi> breaking forth into violent <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,</hi> to that degree as to <hi>Curse the Day of his Birth,</hi> his <hi>Friends</hi> take occasion from thence to enter upon discourse with him: They Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him at first for his too great <hi>Impatience,</hi> and grounding themselves upon <hi>GOD</hi>'s <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> which suffers not <hi>wicked Men</hi> sooner or later to go unpunished, they will needs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue him to be such, and upon this <hi>Supposal</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him into a great and important <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute:</hi> For passing from their <hi>general Thesis That GOD punisheth the Wicked,</hi> to the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, That</hi> Job <hi>was so,</hi> they accuse him of <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Impiety,</hi> partly building this their <hi>Assertion</hi> upon the greatness of his <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> and partly upon some impatient and repining <hi>Expressions,</hi> which now and then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd from him in the excess of his <hi>Grief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The main thing they endeavour to make <hi>Job</hi> sensible of, is, <hi>That GOD punisheth none but the Wicked, and on the contrary showrs down the choicest of his</hi> Blessings <hi>upon good and godly Men;</hi> and from thence conclude, <hi>That since</hi> Job <hi>by such remarkable</hi> Judgments <hi>was deprived of all his</hi> Children, <hi>and his</hi> Estate, <hi>and stript of all his former Advantages and Heavenly</hi> Blessings, <hi>and cast down into most horrible</hi> Calamities; which (thro <hi>human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity</hi>) stir'd up and irritated by their bitter <hi>Reproaches</hi> and <hi>sharp Reflexions,</hi> did at times force some <hi>Discourses</hi> from him too full of Heat, and not so well digested as they might have been; they from all these drew this <hi>unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Consequence, That without doubt he was either a very</hi> Wicked Man, <hi>or a most</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling Hypocrite. To this purpose they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and produce many good and excellent <hi>Sentences,</hi> to confirm their <hi>Judgment;</hi> which tho they were all true in themselves, and with respect to the <hi>Legal Righteousness of GOD,</hi> who in all his <hi>Punishments</hi> supposeth <hi>Sin,</hi> yet could not be well apply'd to <hi>Job</hi>'s Person or Condition.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Job</hi> all this while couragiously defends himself against their <hi>Attacks,</hi> and maintains himself innocent of the <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> they laid to his Charge, protesting that his former <hi>Life</hi> had never been blemish'd with the one or the other. And as to that <hi>Maxim</hi> of theirs, upon which they grounded the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure</hi> of all their <hi>Accusations</hi> against him, he most clearly refutes it from daily Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which makes it apparent, <hi>That</hi> GOD <hi>in this World doth often exercise the best of</hi> Men <hi>with the rudest and hardest</hi> Trials <hi>and</hi> Afflictions; <hi>whereas wicked</hi> Men <hi>(on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63323:170"/>
enjoy abundance of</hi> Prosperity, <hi>and do rather abound with all outward</hi> Blessings, <hi>than groan under the burthen of</hi> Miseries <hi>and</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. And thus supporting himself with the <hi>Witness</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of</hi> GOD in his <hi>Conscience,</hi> he boldly maintains, That he neither is, nor formerly was either a <hi>Profane Person</hi> or an <hi>Hypocrite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He owns indeed, that he cannot stand his ground before the <hi>Soveraign Majesty</hi> of the <hi>Great GOD of Heaven and Earth,</hi> as well in regard of his <hi>absolute Power,</hi> as being nothing in comparison of him, but a weak and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable <hi>Creature:</hi> as with respect to his just and severe <hi>Judgment,</hi> acknowledging himself a poor and miserable <hi>Sinner,</hi> who was not able to answer to one Point of a Thousand, the LORD might of right alledge against him. And yet, he most earnestly wishes, That as to the <hi>Cause,</hi> depending between him and his <hi>Friends,</hi> GOD would be pleased himself to take <hi>cognizance</hi> of it, try it and judge it at the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of his <hi>Justice.</hi> So fully was he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded and convinced in his <hi>Heart</hi> of his <hi>unfeigned Piety,</hi> and his <hi>sincere Uprightness</hi> according to the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time it cannot be denied, but that <hi>Job</hi> being provoked by the <hi>offensive, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate,</hi> and <hi>injurious Discourses</hi> of his <hi>Friends,</hi> he suffered himself at times to be strangely transported, so as to speak of GOD, of his <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> indecently, and not with that <hi>Reverence</hi> as he ought to have done: So that we may say with good Reason. That <hi>Job</hi>'s <hi>Friends</hi> did very well, and with strong and acknowledged <hi>Truths</hi> defend a very bad <hi>Cause;</hi> and that he (on the contrary) did sometimes ill enough, and with <hi>excentrick Motions</hi> defend a very good one. However, he stood so firmly in his own defence, that he would never quit his just <hi>Cause,</hi> nor give it up to his <hi>Friends;</hi> who at last forbearing to answer him, <hi>Elihu</hi> takes up the <hi>Argument</hi> in their stead, and Answers him after another manner than they had done: For he doth not properly accuse him, for having in time past lived <hi>wickedly,</hi> but reproves him for some <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Expressions,</hi> and <hi>ill digested Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> that had escap'd him in his <hi>Conference</hi> with them; as if GOD had injur'd him in so rudely handling of him, for secret <hi>Reasons</hi> only known to his <hi>supream Wisdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore <hi>Elihu</hi> perswades and invites <hi>Job</hi> to <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> because GOD loves to give forth of his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> to poor and miserable <hi>Afflicted ones,</hi> that confide in him. He demonstrates (in opposition to what <hi>Job</hi> had alledg'd) <hi>That</hi> GOD <hi>never injures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Person by</hi> Chastizing <hi>of him, and that he is not accountable or responsible to any Man for what he doth.</hi> And against <hi>Job</hi>'s <hi>Friends he proves, That</hi> GOD <hi>doth not only punish the</hi> Wicked, <hi>but also that he often chastizeth and visits with</hi> Afflictions <hi>such as are</hi> good <hi>and</hi> holy Men, <hi>and that he hath right so to do.</hi> He deduceth his <hi>Proofs</hi> of these <hi>Assertions</hi> from the <hi>Nature of</hi> GOD, which is <hi>All-wise, All-powerful,</hi> and <hi>All-just,</hi> and from his <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Majesty,</hi> which gives him an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable <hi>Empire</hi> over all his <hi>Creatures,</hi> and which cannot but exactly agree, and go hand in hand with all the other Perfections of his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Essence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> acquiescing in <hi>Elihu</hi>'s grounded Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and yeilding to his <hi>Reasons,</hi> holds his peace, not entring upon any further <hi>Contest;</hi> and then the LORD appearing in a <hi>Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,</hi> reproves <hi>Job</hi> for having spoke inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately concerning him, proving this as well from his <hi>Divine Properties,</hi> as by his <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works;</hi> partly respecting the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Universe</hi> in general, and partly the <hi>production</hi> and <hi>conversation</hi> of some great and wonderful <hi>Creatures</hi> in particular.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Divine Censure</hi> pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Job, Job</hi> in all humility acknowledgeth his <hi>Sin,</hi> renders unto GOD the <hi>Glory</hi> due to his <hi>Justice,</hi> and discovers his sincere <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi> The LORD afterwards very sharply <hi>Reproves Job's Friends,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to endeavour a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with him, by procuring his <hi>Faithful Servant Job</hi> to intercede for them, whom he re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth again in his former <hi>state,</hi> doubling all his <hi>Blessings</hi> upon him.</p>
                  <p>It is not well known how long this <hi>severe Trial</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> lasted. The <hi>Jews</hi> say, it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a whole <hi>Year:</hi> Some shorten the time, which again is prolonged by others; but it is not at all needful for us to define, what GOD hath not been pleased to reveal to us in his <hi>Word.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Holy <hi>Job</hi> is tempted by the <hi>Devil,</hi> who deprives him of his <hi>Children,</hi> and of all that he had; and moreover afflicts him with painful <hi>Boils</hi> and <hi>Sores</hi> over all his <hi>Body,</hi> sparing only his <hi>Wife,</hi> whom he made use of to provoke him to Impatience.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HOly <hi>Job,</hi> who is so famous in <hi>Sacred Writ,</hi> for his humble Patience, had in all the former part of his <hi>Life</hi> allied two things,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>'Tis not certainly known when this History hapned, tho it seem probable that it was whilst the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>wandred in the</hi> Wilderness.</note> which are very rarely found to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>viz. a great and extraordinary Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, with vast Riches. He was</hi> (saith the <hi>Scripture) a Man perfect and upright, and fearing</hi> GOD. He did not content himself to avoid all manner of <hi>Evil</hi> himself, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that he was a <hi>Father,</hi> he was very forward to instruct his <hi>Children</hi> in the Fear of the LORD, and often offered <hi>Sacrifices</hi> for any secret <hi>Sins,</hi> and unknown to him, that they might be guilty of.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Vertue</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> was a great Eye-sore to the <hi>Devil,</hi> and made him desirous to have a fling at him; yea, he was so bold as to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate him in the Presence of GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and not being able to find any thing in his <hi>Life</hi> that he could justly blame, he slander'd his secret <hi>Intentions,</hi> maintaining, That he did not serve GOD, but because of the many outward Blessings and Advantages GOD had bestowed upon him.</p>
                     <p>GOD, to confound this <hi>Arch slanderer,</hi> and to convince him of his <hi>Lyes,</hi> gave him leave to take away from <hi>Job</hi> all that he had. The <hi>Devil</hi> made use of this Power that was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, with the utmost Malice; and that he might at once overwhelm this <hi>holy Man</hi> with a whole deluge of Miseries and Calamities one upon the neck of another, he so order'd it. that at one and the same time his Herds of <hi>Oxen</hi> and <hi>Asses</hi> were taken away by the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans,</hi> and his <hi>Herdsmen</hi> kill'd; his <hi>Flocks</hi> of <hi>Sheep</hi> consumed by <hi>Fire</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his <hi>Shepherds</hi> that had the care of them; his <hi>Camels</hi> carried away by the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> and all his <hi>Children</hi> crushed under the Ruins of a <hi>House</hi> that fell upon them whilst they were a <hi>Feasting</hi> in their eldest <hi>Brothers</hi> House.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> received all these dismal Tydings from <hi>Messengers,</hi> that followed at the heels of one another, and came (as it were) all at once crowding in upon him, who with a strange Constancy and unshaken Vertue prostrating himself upon the Ground, worshipped and blessed <hi>GOD,</hi> uttering those words which since are become so famous; <hi>Naked came I into the World, and naked shall I go cut of it again; the</hi> LORD <hi>gave, and the</hi> LORD <hi>hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the</hi> LORD.</p>
                     <p>The Innocence this <hi>holy Man</hi> (preserved in the midst of all these terrible and unheard of Trials, which only served to illustrate his <hi>Vertues,</hi> and to make them shine more bright) highly enraged this malicious <hi>Spirit,</hi> who saw himself confounded by him, whom he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to confound and conquer: Wherefore he again desired power of <hi>GOD</hi> to afflict him in his <hi>Body;</hi> because he can do nothing against the <hi>Saints,</hi> but so far as <hi>GOD</hi> permits him. <hi>GOD</hi> granted him his demand, that he might the more confound his Maliciousness, and to make it appear, that there was nothing, but was sound and sincere in the Vertue of his <hi>Servant Job.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the <hi>Devil</hi> smote <hi>Job</hi> with terrible <hi>Boils</hi> and <hi>

                     </p>

                           <hi>Job</hi> instead of being comforted by his <hi>Three Friends</hi> that came to <hi>Visit</hi> him hath his <hi>Affliction</hi> increased by their means; They concluding him a great <hi>Sinner,</hi> because of the <hi>Disasters</hi> that had hapned to him.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>JOB</hi> being thus reduced to the condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd, seem'd to have as great a load of <hi>Affliction</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> upon him, as was possible to fall upon Man; and yet, as if all this were not sufficient, a new Trouble is added to all his other <hi>Sufferings,</hi> which did as much oppress his Mind, as the other were sensible to his Body.</p>
                     <p>Three of his <hi>Friends,</hi> viz. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manite, Bildad</hi> the <hi>Shuhite,</hi> and <hi>Zophar,</hi> the <hi>Naamathite,</hi> coming to visit him, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole with him for the heavy <hi>Judgments</hi> that had befallen him, and who seeing his <hi>Grief</hi> was so great, they rent their <hi>Mantles</hi> sprinkled <hi>Dust</hi> on their <hi>Heads,</hi> wept and sat down by him for 7 <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Nights</hi> not say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word; at length when they spake, <hi>Job</hi> instead of receiving any solid comfort from them, as probably he might have expected, was fain to defend himself against their false Reasons and unjust Thoughts concerning him. He had nothing to support him under the rude Attack of their sinister Thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, but the testimony of his <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and the innocence and integrity of his past <hi>Life;</hi> which was that his indiscreet <hi>Friends</hi> would rob him of, by mainatining, That it could not be, but he must needs be guilty of great <hi>Crimes,</hi> because <hi>GOD</hi> did so severely chastize him. They made an esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>GOD</hi>'s dealings towards this <hi>holy Man,</hi> according to their carnal and human <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and they mingled very grave Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses with their Demonstrances, only to give the greater authority to their Reflections and Invectives against him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Holy Job</hi> seem'd to be more concern'd and troubled for this last Affliction from his <hi>Friends,</hi> from whose hands in the condition he was; he might have expected better usage, than for all the other Miseries that had overtaken him. He did his utmost endeavour to convince them of their mistake, and by Reasons and Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to rectifie their misapprehensions; but all was to no purpose, they shewing by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, how dangerous it is for Men to suffer themselves to he Leaven'd by bad Impressions and to entertain sinister Thoughts concerning the Innocence of good and holy Men. For suffering themselves to be carried away by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearances, that seem'd to favour their prejudicate Opinions, they were not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from their belief, that <hi>Job</hi> was guilty, because he was handled like one that is so.</p>
                     <p>But GOD at last avenged the Quarrel of his <hi>Servant Job</hi> upon these his unjust <hi>Friends;</hi> for his Anger being kindled against them, he reproached them for the folly of their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, and declar'd, that he would not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this their injurious dealing, or be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to them, but at the <hi>Prayer</hi> of him, whom they had taken so much pains to prove a <hi>Sinner</hi> and wicked <hi>Person.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This Example</hi> (say the <hi>Fathers) ought to teach us, never to entertain any sinister</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>concerning</hi> good <hi>and</hi> righteous Men <hi>how great and extraordinary soever their</hi> Sufferings <hi>may be in this</hi> World; <hi>nor to conceive an high esteem for those, who being more corrupt and ulcerous in their</hi> Souls, <hi>than</hi> Job <hi>was in his</hi> Body, <hi>when he sat upon the</hi> Dunghill; <hi>yet abound with all the Honour and Good things of this</hi> World. <hi>The</hi> Judgment <hi>of</hi> Faith <hi>is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally opposite to that of</hi> Sense.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Those who seem to be outwardly Rich and Righteous, are frequently poor and sinful in the Eyes of</hi> GOD, <hi>and those who are despised, as being poor and reproached as</hi> Sinners, <hi>are often the more rich in</hi> Grace <hi>and</hi> Vertue <hi>in the Eyes of him, who searches the</hi> Heart <hi>and</hi> Reins, <hi>and from whom nothing is hid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>GOD, <hi>at the upshot of all, justified his</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Job <hi>in a most publick and illustrious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, restoring more</hi> Riches <hi>and</hi> Blessings <hi>to him, than ever the</hi> Devil <hi>had taken from him. But under the</hi> New Law, GOD <hi>often suffers his most</hi> faithful Servants <hi>to continue opprest and disgrac'd to the end of their</hi> Lives; <hi>because those who will be his</hi> Disciples <hi>and</hi> Followers, <hi>must (according to the Example of</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>and the</hi> Saints <hi>his Members) not be afraid of, or apprehend any</hi> Evils, <hi>save only those that defile and hurt the</hi> Soul; <hi>nor esteem any Good things or Rewards, but such as are</hi> Spiritual Invisible, <hi>and</hi> Eternal.</p>

His aim and design also is, to conduct all others by his Example to Godliness and Vertue. To this purpose he first of all gives a description of the whole course of his Life, and that whereon he had chiefly founded his delight and satisfaction. Afterward he relates, how he also had been a great Observer of the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Conversation of</hi> Men, and examined the several things they employ their Studies about, and for which they endeavour with the greatest application, as supposing to find <hi>Happiness</hi> and <hi>Content</hi> in them, and that he had found them all to be <hi>Vanity,</hi> and such as engaged Men in Sin and Prophaneness. Furthermore, he declares and positively asserts, That the <hi>World,</hi> its good things, Pleasures, Accidents, Vicissitude, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Customs being all Vicious, or at least corrupt and tainted by the Vanity Sin has introduced into it; That because all things in it are vanishing in their continuance, uncertain in their Conduct, unequal in their tenor, and devoid of any durable Felicity; a Wise Man must not place his hopes in them, or fix his Heart upon them, so as passionately to desire the <hi>good things</hi> in it, or think to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend or avoid all its <hi>disorders</hi> and <hi>evils;</hi> but that he ought moderately to rejoyce himself, without <hi>vexation</hi> or <hi>covetousness,</hi> but yet with care and diligence in his <hi>lawful Calling,</hi> in the short and temporary Enjoyment of the <hi>Blessings</hi> he hath received from the <hi>Liberal Hand of</hi> GOD, conforming his Motions of Joy or Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, according to the variety of Times and Accidents, that happen in this Life by the Dispensation of the <hi>All-wise Providence of</hi> GOD, who governs and disposeth all things in this World as best pleases him; and that they are not at all subject to the uncertainty and hazard of <hi>Chance,</hi> as some most falsly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. And last of all, he exhorts all Men to give up and resign themselves to the Conduct of <hi>true Wisdom,</hi> by fearing GOD sincerely, obeying him faithfully, and by constantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themselves to all manner of <hi>Good Works;</hi> setting continually before their Eyes, especially whilst they are yet <hi>young, vigorous</hi> and <hi>healthy,</hi> the uncertainty of this Life, the unavoidable certainty of Death, the terrour of the just Judgment of GOD, and the Joys of <hi>Eternity:</hi> So that this Book may well of

                  <head>The CONTENTS of the Prophecy of the Prophet ISAIAH.</head>
                  <p>ISAIAH is the first and chiefest of the <hi>greater Prophets,</hi> as well in regard of the excellent <hi>Matter</hi> he treats of, as of his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, sublime and raised <hi>Style.</hi> In the 12 first <hi>Chapters</hi> of this Book of his <hi>Prophesies,</hi> he treats of several <hi>Heads</hi> which particularly concern the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom he Censures and Reproves boldly, Teaches excellently, Exhorts seriously, and Comforts pathetically. From the 13th <hi>Chapter</hi> unto the 29th, he sets down those <hi>Prophesies</hi> which regard Foreign <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> that were <hi>Enemies</hi> to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, as likewise some relating to the 10 <hi>Tribes,</hi> who had divided themselves from <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> denouncing very severe <hi>Judgments</hi> and heavy <hi>Punishments</hi> against them: Amongst which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are mingled very comfortable <hi>Promises</hi> of the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> to those who Repent, whereof they should be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers by having an Eye to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that was to come. From <hi>Chapter</hi> 29th to <hi>Chapter</hi> 36th, is spoken concerning the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and of the <hi>Captivity</hi> or <hi>Transportation</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of their own Country to <hi>Babylon;</hi> which are enterlaced with several excellent and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Passages,</hi> concerning the <hi>Reign of Christ.</hi> From the 36th to the 40th <hi>Chapter,</hi> is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the <hi>History</hi> of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> taken out of 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. From the 40th to the 49th <hi>Chapter,</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> foretels the <hi>Coming of Jesus Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Spiritual Deliverance</hi> of his <hi>Church;</hi> Figured by the <hi>Deliverance</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> by King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as also their <hi>Restauration</hi> and <hi>Settlement</hi> in their own <hi>Country.</hi> From the 49th <hi>Chapter</hi> to the End of the <hi>Book,</hi> are set down several very clear <hi>Prophesies</hi> concerning the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which should be extended throughout all the <hi>World;</hi> of his <hi>Passion,</hi> his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Glorification;</hi> as also of the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>Calling</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were to be joyning and incorporated with his <hi>People</hi> the <hi>Jews;</hi> in like manner, concerning the great <hi>Benefits</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> Christ has purchased for his <hi>Elect</hi> and the Condition of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> as well here upon Earth, as in the Life to come. All which things the <hi>Prophet</hi> describes with so much clearness and evidence, that he seems rather to write a <hi>History</hi> of things past and done, than a <hi>Prophecy</hi> of things to come. Which is the Reason why some of the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> were of Opinion, That <hi>Isaiah</hi> might with as much right be called an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> because in many places he speaks as clearly concerning the <hi>Person, Office</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> many Hundred years before his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> as the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi> have done since; upon which account also he is called by some the 5th <hi>Evangelist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to what concerns the Person of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 'tis generally held, That his Father <hi>Amos</hi> was <hi>Brother</hi> to <hi>Azariah</hi> King of <hi>Judah;</hi> so that this <hi>Prophet,</hi> as to his <hi>Extraction,</hi> was an illustrious Person, as being a Prince of the <hi>Blood: GOD</hi>'s method always having been to Call Persons of all sorts of Conditions to the <hi>Prophetical Office,</hi> as well those of the highest, as of the lowest Quality. As to the Time in which he <hi>Prophesied,</hi> it appears by the first <hi>Verse</hi> of the first <hi>Chapter</hi> of this <hi>Book,</hi> that he Prophesied in the days of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah, Jothan, Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi> And if we compute the years of the Reigns of these 4 <hi>Kings,</hi> we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>Isaiah</hi> Prophesied at least 45 or 50 years, beginning them with the last year of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> (in which year he saw the <hi>Vision</hi> that is described <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.) and ending them with the 14th year of King <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> in which the <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> came to congratulate his Recovery, as may be seen <hi>Chap.</hi> 39. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. But if the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> (as some affirm) lived till the Reign of King <hi>Manasseth,</hi> by whose Command he was <hi>Sawn asunder,</hi> it will follow that he Preached 60 or 64 years; and consequently, that he lived to a very great Age.</p>

                  <p>In his Preaching he generally reproves and censures the <hi>Jews,</hi> in a very sharp and free manner, because of their great and abominable Sins, and exhorts them very seriously and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically to <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Turn to</hi> GOD. And forasmuch as they, from the highest to the least gave no hopes to expect their <hi>Conversion,</hi> as endeavouring rather by their Excesses to fill up the <hi>Measure of their Sins;</hi> he foretels and denounces to them the most Dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of GOD, which were ready to overtake them, particularly the <hi>Destruction</hi> of <hi>Jeruselem,</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> and their <hi>Country,</hi> by the <hi>Arms</hi> of the <hi>King of Babylon;</hi> together with their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Continuance thereof, and all the <hi>Calamities</hi> annexed to that <hi>State;</hi> all which he most lively represents to them, as in a Looking-Glass, that flatter'd not, as well for the conviction of the <hi>Impenitent</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious,</hi> as for the Instruction and Warning of the <hi>Just,</hi> with Words of a singular Emphasis and Energy, ratified and sealed by manifold Divine Signs and Tokens, by his Serious Mourning, Compassionate Lamentations, and earnest Prayers, mingled with bitter Tears, and sad Complaints, as foreseeing the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Judgments, which like a Deluge were ready to overwhelm them, and which (not long after, to his great Heart-breaking) he was fain to be a Spectator of.</p>
                  <p>And, on the other hand he is not wanting to comfort and strengthen the small afflicted Remainder of <hi>Repenting and Believing Souls,</hi> partly by very comfortable and clear <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi> concerning their <hi>Deliverance</hi> from the <hi>Captivity of Babylon,</hi> their <hi>Return</hi> to their own <hi>Country,</hi> and other Favours GOD would bestow upon them; which he perspicuously sets before their Eyes, and backs with many Divine Signs, and Wonderful Visions; and also by many horrible Judgments denounced against their Enemies that had afflicted them, and especially against that Proud and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical <hi>Babylon,</hi> being an express Figure of the <hi>Mystical Babylon</hi> of the New Testament; but more particularly by very express and clear <hi>Prophesies,</hi> concerning the Spiritual Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>God's People</hi> by the <hi>Messiah, Our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> concerning whose Person, Office, his Covenant of Grace, the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel, the Catholick Church compos'd of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and of the Salvation and abundant Blessing of that Church (as well Triumphant as Military) he Prophesies amply, gloriously, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably.</p>

                  <p>But besides these things concerning his own Person, he also sets down the actual accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of several of his Prophesies, as the Siege of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the miserable

state of the City during the Siege, the taking and destruction of the City, of the Temple and Country, and the carrying the People Captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and what became of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were left in <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> began to Prophecy the third Year of King <hi>Josiah</hi> (Chap. 1, 2.) who was the Grandchild of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> under whom some think that the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> was <hi>Sawn</hi> in pieces, <hi>Amon</hi>'s Reign of 2 Years only interceding between those two Kings, so that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> followed soon after <hi>Isaiah.</hi> But how long <hi>Jeremiah</hi> Prophesied after the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in <hi>Judea,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>Egypt,</hi> is uncertain. This only is remarkable, That <hi>Jeremiah</hi> under <hi>Zedekiah</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> which were left in <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> amongst those that were carried away Captives with <hi>Jehojachim,</hi> did both of them Prophecy at the same time the very same Things concerning the Destruction of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> and whole <hi>Country,</hi> and both of them also survived to be Eye-witnesses of the accomplishment of their Prophesies and Denunciations.</p>

                  <head>The Contents of the <hi>Lamentations</hi> of JEREMIAH.</head>
                  <p>THis Book bears the Title of <hi>LAMEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATIONS,</hi> which seems to be taken from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.25. and sufficiently informs us concerning the Subject Matter it contains, <hi>viz.</hi> the dolorous Complaints which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet makes in his own Name, and of the whole Church, upon occasion of the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Desolation of the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> and City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as well as the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable state and condition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who in vast Numbers were destroy'd by War, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and Pestilence. And is composed of such exquisite and Emphatical Words, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in so excellent, sublime and moving a <hi>Style,</hi> that no Writings whatsoever of the most <hi>Eloquent Heathen Authors,</hi> are worthy to come in comparison with it.</p>
                  <p>We find indeed up and down in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture other particular <hi>Lamentations,</hi> as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> Chap. 1.19, &amp;c. upon the Death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan;</hi> and upon the desolation of the City <hi>Tyre,</hi> Ezek. 28.12. But this Book of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> respecting a general Calamity which involved the <hi>whole People of</hi> GOD, doth alone bear and retain the Name of <hi>Lamentations</hi> amongst all <hi>Christian Nations;</hi> even as the <hi>Song of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> only by way of Excellency bears that Title, notwithstanding that many excellent Hymns and Songs of Praise are set down in <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> as in <hi>Exod.</hi> Chap. 15. we find the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> with that of <hi>Miriam</hi> and the <hi>Jewish Women,</hi> for their Deliverance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> that of <hi>Deborah</hi> in the 5th Chapter of <hi>Judges;</hi> of <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 Sam. chap. 2. and the Song of the <hi>Blessed Virgin Mary,</hi> Luke chap. 1.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not certainly known when <hi>Jeremiah</hi> wrote this Book; some are of Opinion, that a part of it was written, immmediately after the Death of good King <hi>Josiah;</hi> after whose Death the <hi>Jewish</hi> State and Government suffered a manifest Eclipse and Decay, as may be seen, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.25. and <hi>Zechar.</hi> 12.11. But others think it was pen'd after the Destruction of the City and Temple by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and after that the <hi>Jews,</hi> which for a time were left in <hi>Judea,</hi> had been carried Captives to <hi>Babylon,</hi> as the whole Sequel of this Book seems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. <hi>See</hi> Chap. 1.3. <hi>and Chap.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                  <p>However it may be, we find that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> having undertaken to set forth the Lamentable Condition of <hi>Judea,</hi> and its <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> begins his Lamentation with this Exclamation; <hi>How doth the City sit solitary that was full of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> &amp;c. but at the same time he represents to them their heinous and manifold Sins, and exhorts them to Repentance, and Prayers for Mercy, as also to Patience, and necessary confidence in expecting a favourable Issue. The intention of the Prophet not being to cast Men into excessive Sorrow, which dissolves the Natural Tye there is between the Patience and Silence of the Faithful; but to instruct us to acknowledge the <hi>Finger of</hi> GOD, in the Calamities which overtake the Church, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose us to an humble Submission of our selves under his Hand, to a patient and quiet bearing of his Chastisements, and to confidence and assurance in his Promises.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He began to <hi>Prophecy</hi> when he was but Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of Age, and had many <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi> concerning the manifold <hi>Miseries</hi> and <hi>Calamities,</hi> that were to overtake the <hi>Jews</hi> for their manifold <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Rebellions</hi> against the <hi>LORD;</hi> and it is he of all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> who as he was most deeply concerned in them, so he has exprest them in the most moving and pathetical Terms, as may be seen in his <hi>Lamentations.</hi> As he was very sensibly affected with these <hi>Calamities</hi> himself, so he foretold them to others with an extraordinary vehemence and earnestness; and with a great deal of <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>boldness</hi> founded forth the <hi>dreadful Denunciations</hi> GOD had charged him to declare to the People.</p>

                     <p>Some of the Princes at last being enraged against <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> because he had foretold that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> would come and take the <hi>City,</hi> conspir'd his <hi>Death;</hi> and addressing themselves to King <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> who had a Kindness for <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> desired leave of him to cast him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Dungeon,</hi> which was in the <hi>Prison,</hi> very noysom and full of <hi>Mire;</hi> and this weak <hi>King,</hi> not being able to deny their Request, abondon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the holy Prophet to the Rage of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, who immediately caused him to be let down with Cords into the Dungeon, where he stuck fast in the Mire, and could not have lived long there, especially considering the <hi>Famine</hi> which then was in the <hi>City.</hi>

                     <p>But one of the <hi>Kings Eunuchs</hi> having with a great deal of zeal and boldness represented to the King, the injury done to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> which would infallibly be the cause of his Death, and that suddenly too, except he were removed thence; <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ordered the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to take thirty <hi>Men</hi> along with him, and to take up <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> out of the Dungeon, and ever after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected him from the rage and fury of his <hi>Enemies.</hi>

And accordingly we find, that in the beginning of his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Prophesies</hi> GOD pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to make him a <hi>Fortified City,</hi> that is, of proof to resist all manner of Attacks and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults whatsoever; and to endue him with the constancy and resistance of an <hi>Iron-Pillar</hi> and <hi>Brazen-Wall,</hi> against the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> against the <hi>Princes</hi> thereof, and against all the <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>Land;</hi> that they indeed should fight against him, but should never prevail, because he himself would be with him.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 3420. <hi>before Christ</hi> 584.</note> is most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and much taken notice of by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Church.</hi> The Prophet tells us, That he was carried by the Spirit of the LORD, and set down in a Valley which was full of <hi>dry Dead-mens Bones,</hi> and having made him go round the Valley, to take a full view of the vast number and condition of them; the LORD demanded of him, Whether he thought those <hi>dry Bones</hi> could be restor'd to Life again? To which the Prophet having answered, <hi>O LORD GOD thou knowest.</hi> He commanded him to Prophecy to those <hi>Bones</hi> in his Name, <hi>That they should be joyned Bone to his Bone, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Flesh and live.</hi> No sooner had the Prophet declared this to the Bones in the Name of GOD, to whom all things are alive, and whose Power nothing can resist, but he immediately saw the execution of it; for with a great noise all the Bones came together, and were covered with <hi>Sinews, Muscles, Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Skin,</hi> but there was yet no Life in them. Wherefore the LORD again commanded the Prophet to Prophecy to the <hi>living Breath,</hi> and to command it to come from the <hi>four Winds,</hi> and to breath upon those <hi>dead</hi> Bodies, that they might live; whereupon the same Spirit, which was in the <hi>Creation</hi> breathed by GOD into the first Man, after that he had made his Body of the Earth came into these <hi>dead</hi> Bodies, and immediately they stood upon their Feet and liv'd, and were an exceeding great Army.</p>
                     <p>After that the LORD had shewed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> this wonderful Vision, that he might not be ignorant of the meaning of it, he told him, That the dry Bones which he had seen, were the whole House of <hi>Israel,</hi> who looked upon themselves (in the condition they were then in, being Captives in <hi>Babylon</hi>) as so many dry Bones, which had no hopes ever to live again, that is, to be restored to those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold advantages they once enjoyed in their own Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y. But GOD farther commands <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to assure them, That notwithstanding all the Discouragements which at present they did lie under, he would as miraculously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store and deliver them, as the Prophet had seen him miraculously restore those dry Bones to Life, contrary to all human possibility or expectation.</p>
                     <p>Now, as GOD himself here applies this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the wonderful Deliverance he would one Day grant the <hi>Jews</hi> from the miserable state of <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Captivity</hi> they were in, and that amongst an <hi>Idolatrous People,</hi> far from their own Country, without the comfort of those many Priviledges and Advantages they enjoyed there, above all other Nations of the World; so we may as truly apply it to the Church of GOD, which shall be as miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously delivered from her state of <hi>Deadness, Apostacy, Captivity</hi> and <hi>Bondage,</hi> wherein she is at present in <hi>Spiritual Babylon,</hi> as these <hi>dead</hi> Bones were contrary to all hopes and outward possibility joyned together Bone to his Bone, and raised to Life.</p>
                     <p>GOD also would put us in mind by this Vision. <hi>That how desperate soever the condition of</hi> Sinners <hi>may seem to be, who have been a long time habituated to</hi> Sin, <hi>and grown old in</hi> Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, <hi>and are thereby not only become like a</hi> dead Body, <hi>but as</hi> dry Bones; <hi>yet that he to whom all things are possible, and who calls those things that are not, as tho' they were, can raise them again to the Life of</hi> Righteousness <hi>and</hi> Holiness, <hi>and bringing them out of their</hi> Graves, <hi>regenerate them again to a</hi> New<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Some <hi>Malicious Spirits</hi> having observed that <hi>Hananiah, Mishael,</hi> and <hi>Azariah,</hi> when all the rest of the Company, that were present, fell down upon their Faces, and worshipped the Image, did not express any Adoration to the same, went and accused them before the King, for refusing to obey the Kings solemn and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Command, to worship the Statue he had erected.</p>

                     <p>GOD, upon this occasion, verified to the Letter what he had promised in the <hi>Psalms, That he would be with those that love him, in their greatest distress and trouble;</hi> for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of GOD visibly appearing in the <hi>Furnace,</hi> protected these young Men, and restrain'd the violence of the Fire, which only consuming the Cords wherewith they were tied, left them to walk at liberty in the midst of the Furnace, and found a sweet refreshing Dew in the midst of those Flames; for having a stronger Fire burning in their Hearts than what encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them about, they sang Praises to GOD for so visible a Protection, calling upon all Creatures to do the same.</p>
                     <p>The King more transported at the sight of this Miracle, than but a little before he had been with Passion and Fury, commanded these <hi>Young Men</hi> to come forth out of the <hi>Furnace,</hi> and <hi>blessing</hi> GOD, for that he had sent his Angel to deliver his <hi>Servants,</hi> he commanded all his Subjects, upon pain of Death, not to speak irreverently of the GOD of <hi>Shadrach, Meshach</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> and promoted them to great Honour.</p>

                     <p>GOD; to this end, represented to him in a Dream the Judgment he was determin'd to bring upon him; and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> having declared the same to <hi>Daniel,</hi> he interpreted it unto him in this manner: <hi>Thou didst see in thy</hi> Dream, <hi>O King, a great</hi> Tree, <hi>whose height reached up to</hi> Heaven, <hi>and whose</hi> Branches <hi>reached to the Ends of the</hi> Earth; <hi>its</hi> Leaves <hi>were fair and flourishing and its</hi> Boughs <hi>loaden with</hi> Fruit; <hi>the</hi> Beasts <hi>of the</hi> Field <hi>did feed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its</hi> shadow, <hi>and the</hi> Birds <hi>of</hi> Heaven <hi>made their</hi> Nest <hi>in its</hi> Branches. <hi>This great</hi> Tree, <hi>which thou hast seen,</hi> O King, <hi>is thy self, whose</hi> Majesty <hi>is lifted up to</hi> Heaven, <hi>and extended over all the</hi> Earth. <hi>And whereas thou didst see a</hi> Watcher, <hi>an</hi> Holy One, <hi>come down from</hi> Heaven, <hi>saying,</hi> Hew the Tree down and destroy it, yet leave the Stump thereof in the Earth, with a Band of Iron and Brass, in the tender Grass of the Field; and let it be wet with the Dew of Heaven, and let his portion be with the Beasts of the Field, until Seven times pass over him. <hi>This is the Sentence which the</hi> Most High <hi>has pronounced against my</hi> Lord <hi>the</hi> King! <hi>That they shall drive thee from</hi> Men, <hi>and thy dwelling shall be with the Beasts of the</hi> Field, <hi>and they shall make thee eat</hi> Grass <hi>as an</hi> Ox, <hi>and thou shalt be made wet with the</hi> Dew of Heaven, <hi>until that Seven times pass over thee; and thou be made to acknowledge, That the</hi> Most High <hi>ruleth in the</hi> Kingdoms of Men, <hi>and giveth them to whom he pleaseth. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they commanded to leave the</hi> Stump <hi>of the</hi> Tree Roots <hi>in the</hi> Earth, <hi>this signifies, That thy</hi> Kingdom <hi>shall return unto thee after that thou shalt have known, that the</hi> Heavens <hi>rule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Prediction was fulfilled in the manner following: As the King on a time was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Palace of the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and was admiring the wonderful Works that he had made, and the greatness and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which he had built for to be the Palace of his Residence, and for the glory of His Majesty; there came a Voice from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> which told him, <hi>That the Kingdom was departed from him;</hi> and immediately thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was struck by the <hi>Hand</hi> of GOD, which the same moment fulfilled the Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against him; he was driven from Men, and did eat Grass with Oxen, and his Body was wet with the Dew of Heaven for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years, even until his Hair was grown like Eagles Feathers, and his Nails like Birds Claws.</p>
                     <p>GOD made it appear by this terrible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, how severely he punisheth secret Pride, and elevation of the Heart, casting them down to the state of Beasts, who lift up themselves by their Arrogance above the condition of Men. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (saith S. <hi>Bernard</hi>) is the Image of <hi>Fallen Man,</hi> who by lifting up himself in Pride, lost his Heavenly Estate and Kingdom, and became like unto the Beasts that perish.</p>

greatly honoured <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> looking upon him as a Person fill'd with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of GOD, because he was informed what he had formerly foretold to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Belshazzar</hi> his Grandchild, insomuch that he had thoughts of setting him over the whole <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and making him his <hi>Lord-deputy,</hi> or <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi>

                     <p>But the more the <hi>King</hi> was thus pleased to honour and heap his Favouors upon him, the more he stir'd up the envy and hatred of his great <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> against him, who were troubled to see <hi>Daniel,</hi> a <hi>Captive Jew,</hi> to outstrip them all. Their Envy made them narrowly to observe <hi>Daniel,</hi> in hopes of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with some slip of his, whereof they might accuse him; but seeing his Life and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affairs altogether irreproachable; they concluded, they should never find any thing to accuse him of, except in a case where the <hi>Law</hi> of his GOD was concerned.

                     <p>But <hi>Darius,</hi> who had a great Kindness for <hi>Daniel,</hi> being sorely troubled that ever he had consented to the publishing so unjust a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, did his utmost endeavour to deliver <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> out of their hands.

                     </p>
                     <p>The weakness of this <hi>King,</hi> being greater than the desire he had to save <hi>Daniel,</hi> oblig'd him at last to comply with their unjust desire, and to order him to be cast into the <hi>Den</hi> of <hi>Lions,</hi> tho sore against his Will, and expressing the hope he had, that the GOD whom he serv'd would not fail to delived him; neither was he at all deceived therein; for the next day, rising very early in the Morning, he went to the Mouth of the <hi>Den</hi> of <hi>Lions,</hi> and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Daniel,</hi> he found, to his great Joy, that he was yet alive; and as the <hi>King</hi> seem'd surpriz'd at this miraculous Preservation of the <hi>holy Prophet,</hi> he told him, That <hi>GOD</hi> had sent his <hi>Angel</hi> into the <hi>Den,</hi> who had stopt the <hi>Lions Mouths,</hi> and hindred them from doing him any hurt, because he had found him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in his sight, however his best Actions might be misrepresented by Men.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>King</hi> ravish'd with Joy to see the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he so highly valued thus wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, ordered him presently to be taken out of the <hi>Den;</hi> and at the same time command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That all <hi>Daniels Enemies</hi> that had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, and laid this Snare for him, should be cast with their <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> into the same <hi>Den,</hi> from whence he was so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously saved, who seiz'd and tore them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever they came to the bottom of the <hi>Den,</hi> and brake all their <hi>Bones</hi> to pieces.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>DANIEL</hi> is one of those Prophets, to whom GOD was pleased more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to reveal in <hi>Mystical Visions,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 3449. <hi>before Christ</hi> 555.</note> the whole course and sequel of the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the World throughout all Ages to come. All which different <hi>Governments</hi> he has so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly described, and set forth with such clear distinguishing Marks, that he seems rather to be an Historian, giving an account of things that are already past, than a Prophet, foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling things to come.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vision</hi> represented in this <hi>Figure,</hi> and which <hi>Daniel</hi> declares was shewed to him in the first Year of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> is one of those just now mention'd. This <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> as he lay on his Bed, saw in a Dream four different great Beasts come up out of the Sea, which was tossed and agitated by the four Winds, rushing out upon it. The first of these Beasts was like a <hi>Lion,</hi> and had the Wings of an <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle:</hi> the second Beast was like a <hi>Bear,</hi> and had three Ribs in its Mouth; the third Beast was like a <hi>Leopard,</hi> which had upon its Back four Wings of a Fowl, and four Heads; the fourth Beast was more dreadful and terrible than all the rest, and exceeding strong, having great Iron-Teeth, wherewith it devoured and break to pieces all it met with, stamping the residue with its Feet: It had also Ten Horns on its Head, in the midst of which came up a little Horn, before which three of the other Horns were pluckt up by the Roots, and in it were Eyes like those of a Man, and a Mouth speaking great Things.</p>
                     <p>After this the Prophet saw the <hi>Glory of</hi> GOD, and the <hi>Ancient of Days</hi> seated upon his Throne, with many Millions of Angels at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him, to judge those Beasts, and put an end to their Dominion, and he saw the fourth Beast slain, and his Body cast into the Fire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> being desirous to know the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this <hi>Vision,</hi> asked one of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> what those four Beasts were which he had seen? The <hi>Angel,</hi> to satisfie his Repuest, told him, That the four great Beasts he had seen, were four Kings or Kingdoms, which should successively appear upon the Earth. But the Prophet having been much surpriz'd at the terrible shape, rage and strength of the fourth Beast, which was different from all the rest, desired the <hi>Angel</hi> in particuler, to give him some light and information concerning it. Whereupon the <hi>Angel</hi> told him, That the fourth. Beast he had seen, was a fourth King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which should be diverse from all other Kingdoms, and should devour the whole Earth, and tread it down, and break it to pieces; and that the Ten Horns were Ten Kings, which should successively have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in that Kingdom. That the <hi>Little Horn</hi> which came up amongst the <hi>Ten Horns,</hi> was a <hi>King</hi> that should arise and subdue <hi>Three Kings,</hi> and should speak great Words against the <hi>Most High,</hi> and wear out the Saints of the <hi>Most High,</hi> and think to change Times and Laws, which should also be given into his hand for a <hi>Time, Times, and Half a Time;</hi> that is, for a <hi>Year, two Years,</hi> and <hi>half a Year,</hi> or <hi>Threee Years and an half.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Angel</hi> also told him, That after this Term was elapsed, the Great GOD would sit in Judgment upon him, and that his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion should be taken away, and consum'd and destroy'd for ever. And that after all those <hi>Earthly Kingdoms</hi> (fitly compared to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Beasts, and the last of them to a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monster) GOD himself would erect his own <hi>Heavenly, Beneficent,</hi> and <hi>Peaceful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> upon <hi>Earth;</hi> during which, the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the greatness of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, should be given to the <hi>Saints</hi> of the <hi>Most High;</hi> and that this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom should never be supplanted by any other, but continue an <hi>everlasting Kingdom</hi> to the End of Ages, all other <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> being subject to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The most take these four</hi> Kingdoms <hi>to be the four</hi> Great Monarchies <hi>of the</hi> World, viz. <hi>the</hi> Assyrian, <hi>the</hi> Persian, <hi>the</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Roman Monarchy; <hi>and the</hi> Little Horn <hi>to denote</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist; <hi>and that the</hi> Kingdom <hi>which shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-top, consume and out-last them all, is the</hi> Kingdom <hi>of our</hi> LORD Jesus Christ, <hi>who is the</hi> King of Kings <hi>and</hi> Lord of Lords.</p>

                  <head>The CONTENTS of the Book of the Prophet HOSEA.</head>
                  <p>SAint <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7.42. alledging a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage out of <hi>Amos,</hi> quotes it as written in the Book of the Prophets; because in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and to this Day among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the 12 small <hi>Prophets</hi> (as they are called) were never accounted but as one <hi>Book,</hi> and constituted one Volume only amongst those of the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi> tho subdivided into 12 different Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to the number and distinction of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> whose <hi>Revelations</hi> are therein contained. The first place amongst these is given to the <hi>Prophesies</hi> of <hi>Hosea,</hi> who as well as <hi>Amos</hi> and others, was in particular sent by GOD to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> or the Ten <hi>Tribes,</hi> tho here and there also we find those of <hi>Judah</hi> censured and threatned in these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,</hi> for an evident proof of GOD's Long-suffering, as well as of his Faithfulness in his Promises: For notwithstanding that by reason of a most condemnable Schism, extreamly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> they had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themselves from the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> out of which the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be born, and from the <hi>Communion</hi> of the true and due <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of GOD; yet the LORD was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to raise up <hi>Prophets,</hi> to declare his Word and Will unto them; partly, that they might be a support and comfort to the remainder of his Elect that were amongst them, to preserve them from the corruption and gross Idolatry of the Age wherein they lived, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and continue them in the Profession of his <hi>Holy Covenant;</hi> and on the other hand, to censure and reprove the Rebellious and Wicked, to call them to Repentance; and by this means leaving them inexcusable, and their Condemnation just.</p>
                  <p>Now forasmuch as the <hi>Prophet Hosea</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied a long time amongst the Ten <hi>Tribes,</hi> as appears from <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. so the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> thought it necessary for the perpetual use and edification of the <hi>Church,</hi> that the sum and substance of his <hi>Prephesies</hi> and <hi>Revelations,</hi> should be recorded to After-Ages, as they are set down in this Book; which contains first of all an exact Description, and severe <hi>Prophetical Reproof</hi> of the wicked and corrupt Estate of the whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and particularly of the infamous <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which was in Vogue amongst them, in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the <hi>Golden Calves,</hi> which in the Reign of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Solomon,</hi> were set up at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> their first King, under whom they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themselves from <hi>Judah,</hi> and the pure <hi>Worship of GOD,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.27, 28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> of theirs was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a fearful and more than <hi>Pagan</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and dissolution of <hi>Manners,</hi> and an universal Deluge of all sorts of <hi>Sins,</hi> both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the first and second Table, and amongst all sorts of Men, of what condition or quality soever; which the <hi>LORD</hi> by his <hi>Prophet Hosea</hi> doth most vigorously check and reprove, with divers very pathetical <hi>Exhortations</hi> to a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ready <hi>Repentance.</hi> But forasmuch as the impiety and hardness of their Heart still encreast daily from the top of the Head to the sole of the Foot; from the Kings and Princes, to the least and meanest of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> in the next place denounces to them the total Destruction and Overthrow of their <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that they should be transported out of their own Country, and carried Captives into <hi>Assyria,</hi> where they should continue under a long and deplorable dispersion amongst strange and <hi>Idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> And lastly, The <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Penitent</hi> amongst them are comforted and supported by the sweet and saving <hi>Promises</hi> of the Favour and Grace of GOD in their Heavenly King <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to whom in due time all the <hi>Elect</hi> should be converted and gathered, not only of <hi>Israel,</hi> but also of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in order to be eternally Blessed in and through him.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Anno Mundi 3197. <hi>before Christ</hi> 807.</note> That he was resolved to destroy it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Sins of its Inhabitants, or (as the <hi>Scripture</hi> expresseth it) <hi>because their Wickedness was come up before him.

                     </p>
                     <p>But GOD, to make it appear, that nothing undertaken against his Will can take effect, and that he accomplisheth his designs, even by the resistance and opposition Men make against them, raised a great Tempest, which endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd to Shipwreck the Vessel in which <hi>Jonah</hi> was, and putting the Mariners into a great Consternation, they cast forth the Goods into the Sea, to lighten it. <hi>Jonah</hi> acknowledging the Hand of GOD in this extraordinary <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,</hi> and being grieved for his Disobedience and Rebellion against the LORD, was gone down into the <hi>Hold,</hi> where he fell fast asleep, his sound Sleep being an effect rather of his Trouble and Sorrow, than of any satisfaction or assurance in the midst of so imminent a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, into which he had not only plung'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but all those that were in the Vessel with him.</p>
                     <p>The Master of the Ship, not thinking it fit that he should lie and Sleep, whilst all the Ships-Crew and Passengers were either labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Life to save the Vessel, or praying to their <hi>Gods,</hi> call'd upon him to arise, and call upon his GOD, that they might be saved from perishing. But at last perceiving that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the Storm eluded and frustrated all their Endeavours, and that the fierceness of it still increased more and more; some of the Company supposing, that this unusual Storm was caused by the extraordinary Crimes of some that were in the Vessel, propounded to cast <hi>Lots,</hi> to know who was the Author and occasion of their Danger.</p>
                     <p>This Proposal being generally approv'd of, it was put in practice, and the <hi>Lot</hi> fell upon <hi>Jonah;</hi> whereupon they earnestly demanding of him, <hi>Who he was, and what he had done, to stir up the Anger of</hi> Heaven <hi>against them and himself? Jonah</hi> very freely confest all, and that he was the only cause of the Storm that still tossed them. And demanding further of him, <hi>What they should do to him that the</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest <hi>might cease</hi>? He answered them, That <hi>if they desired good</hi> Weather <hi>and a</hi> calm Sea, <hi>they must throw him Over-board, and so by his</hi> Death <hi>procure their own Safety.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Master and Ships-Crew being not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle surpriz'd at this free and unconcern'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, by which he doom'd himself to Death, conceiv'd more Pity for him than he seem'd to have for himself, and endeavour'd by Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard to reach the Land; but seeing that all their Strivings were in vain, and that the Sea wrought high against them, they at last cast him into the <hi>Sea,</hi> (tho sore against their Wills,) and appealing to GOD, That they were not guilty of his Blood, whom they would so gladly have saved.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mariners</hi> no sooner perform'd this, but the <hi>Sea</hi> ceased from raging; and the LORD at the same time had prepared a <hi>Whale</hi> to swallow <hi>Jonah,</hi> who being in the <hi>Whales-Belly,</hi> and calling to mind his own Disobedience, and the great and miraculous Mercy of GOD to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, <hi>Sung Praises unto the LORD from that living Grave;</hi> where after he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued three Days, the Whale (at GOD's Command) Vomited him out upon the <hi>dry Land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus we see, that</hi> Life <hi>came forth</hi> victorious <hi>and</hi> triumphant <hi>from the very Entrails of</hi> Death, <hi>to be a</hi> lively Representation <hi>of that stupendous and ineffable</hi> Victory, <hi>which</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>Eight hundred Years after, was to obtain against</hi> Death <hi>and</hi> Hell: <hi>When after he had freely offer'd himself to be cast into the</hi> Sea, <hi>for the</hi> Salvation <hi>of the</hi> World; <hi>and after he had been</hi> three Days <hi>and</hi> three Nights <hi>in the</hi> Heart <hi>of the</hi> Earth, <hi>he arose from thence full of</hi> Life, <hi>by a glorious</hi> Resurrection. <hi>And we may here very well say with the</hi> Fathers, How Miraculous must those <hi>Truths</hi> be, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> only are such great Miracles?</p>

he commanded him a second time to go to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and Preach to that <hi>Great City,</hi> and to declare the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission he had charged with him. <hi>Jonah</hi> now no more cast about, how he might avoid the Command laid upon him, but by his ready Obedience made it appear, how much he had profited by the Affliction GOD had sent him, and that he had learnt never any more to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself against the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> though never so difficult or thwarting of his own.</p>
                     <p>In this disposition he went (contrary to the custom of all other <hi>Prophets</hi>) to Preach to a People that were <hi>Heathen Idolaters,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in also he might be a Figure of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who in time to come was to Convert the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> Now <hi>Nineveh</hi> was a great City, which (as the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us) was three Days Journey in length. When <hi>Jonah</hi> was advanc'd into the City about a Days Journey, he lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his Voice, and declared, <hi>That yet forty Days, and</hi> Nineveh <hi>should be destroyed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Inhabitants</hi> being terrified with this Denunciation, believed the <hi>Word of</hi> GOD by his Prophet, and with an humble Faith (which according to the <hi>Word of our Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> will prove the condemnation of those <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> that do not Repent) they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a <hi>Fast,</hi> and put on <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> from the greatest of them to the least, to the end that their Sorrow and Repentance might be as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as their Corruption and Sins had been; and that as no Age, Sex, nor Quality had been free from contributing to the Guilt; so none might be exempted from the Penance, that might make Attonement for it.</p>
                     <p>The King himself being strangely Alarmed with the News of this sudden Destruction, threatning Him and his Subjects, came down from his Throne, and quitted all his Royal Robes and Ornaments, to put on Sackcloth, and sit in Ashes: And not contented to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite his Subjects to Repentance by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only, he published an Edict, and caused it to be proclaimed through the City, That neither <hi>Man</hi> nor <hi>Beast, Herd</hi> nor <hi>Flock,</hi> should <hi>eat</hi> or <hi>drink</hi> any thing; and that all his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> should apply themselves to cry mightily to GGD, and every one of them turn from their Evil ways, and the Violence that was in their <hi>Hands: For who can tell</hi> (said he) <hi>but</hi> GOD <hi>will take pity of us, and turn away from his</hi> fierce Anger, <hi>that we perish not</hi>?</p>
                     <p>Thus a whole City, and so great a City as <hi>Nineveh</hi> was, humbling and abasing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before the <hi>Eyes of</hi> GOD, from the <hi>King</hi> upon the Throne, unto the poorest and most contemptible <hi>Subject,</hi> moved GOD<hi>'s Mercy and Bowels</hi> in Pity towards them; who seeing them changed from what they were, he also changed the <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, as having done it only for this end, to make them by their serious and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Repentance</hi> to prevent the <hi>Punishment,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his <hi>Justice</hi> threatned them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> Repentance <hi>of the</hi> Ninevites <hi>is a great and illustrious</hi> Example <hi>of sincere and hearty</hi> Repentance; <hi>and therefore we ought often to set it before our</hi> Eyes, <hi>that as we have been and still are Followers of them in</hi> Sin <hi>and</hi> Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; <hi>so we might endeavour to imitate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press their</hi> Repentance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And this the rather, because our</hi> Saviour JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST <hi>assures us,</hi> That this Example of the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> shall confound and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all those, who living under the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel,</hi> do still continue in <hi>Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief;</hi> because the Menaces he has pronounced in the <hi>Gospel</hi> against <hi>Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners,</hi> ought without comparison to be more dreadful and terrible to us, than those of <hi>Jonah</hi> were to the <hi>Heathen Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Nineveh.</hi>

Tho' indeed he was very far from being a <hi>False Prophet;</hi> for in declaring that <hi>Nineveh</hi> should be destroyed in <hi>Forty Days,</hi> he declared nothing but the very truth: <hi>For</hi> (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> excellently observes) <hi>tho' that</hi> City <hi>subsisted still as to its</hi> Buildings <hi>and</hi> Walls, <hi>yet was it most happily destroyed by the</hi> Repentance <hi>and</hi> Conversion <hi>of its</hi> Inhabitants; <hi>for wicked, licentious, riotous and haughty</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh <hi>was destroy'd and overthrown, and an humble, penitent, and self-denying</hi> City <hi>now supply'd its place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> had suffered, the fear he had of being accounted a <hi>False Prophet,</hi> to take so deep an impression upon him; and upon this occasion had so far given himself up to Grief and Discontent, that complaining to GOD of this his unseasonable <hi>Mercy,</hi> (as his Passion represented it to him) he beseeched him to take his <hi>Life</hi> from him, because it seemed far more eligible to him to die, than to live. The LORD with great <hi>Long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> bearing with this sinful weakness of his Servant <hi>Jonah,</hi> only demanded of him, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did well to be angry</hi>? Appealing to himself about the unreasonableness of this his Sullen Temper.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Jonah</hi> (who was not yet cured by this mild Check the LORD had given him, to make him reflect upon his unseemly Carriage) being come out of the City, made himself a Booth on the East-side of it, and rested himself there under the Shadow of it, to see what would become of the City. And GOD (to make his little <hi>Hermitage</hi> more cool, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) caused a <hi>Guord</hi> to spring up in one Night, which by the next Morning covered his Bower, affording him a very cool and grateful shade.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jonah</hi> was very glad of this unexpected and seasonable Refreshment, but it prov'd very short; for GOD had prepared a <hi>Worm,</hi> which eating into the Root of the <hi>Gourd,</hi> it soon wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and left <hi>Jonah</hi> expos'd to the violent heat of the <hi>Sun-beams;</hi> and that the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause GOD sent a vehement <hi>East-Wind,</hi> which (together with the heat of the <hi>Sun</hi> beating upon his <hi>Head</hi>) made him faint, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his discontented Humor, he a second time earnestly desired of GOD he might die.</p>
                     <p>But GOD taking occasion from this Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate transport of the Prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> to make him apprehend, how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much grief and trouble it occasion'd to him, when he found himself forced to punish the <hi>Crimes of Mankind,</hi> and how great a Violence it would have been to his Goodness and Inclination to pardon and pass by Sins, had he been obliged to destroy that great City, demanded again of <hi>Jonah, Whether he did well to be angry</hi>? Who answer'd, <hi>That he did well to be angry unto Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This peevish and froward Answer of <hi>Jonah</hi> did not hinder the LORD from mildly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to shew him his exorbitant Carriage in this point, by this most sensible and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Remonstrance: <hi>Consider</hi> Jonah <hi>what thou dost, thy own Behaviour does condemn thee; Thou hast had pity on the</hi> Gourd, <hi>for the which thou didst not labour, neither madest it grow, which came up in a</hi> Night, <hi>and perished in a</hi> Night. <hi>And wouldst thou have me to have no Concern or Pity for</hi> Nineveh, <hi>that great</hi> City, <hi>wherein are more than</hi> Sixscore Thousand <hi>Innocent</hi> Children, <hi>that cannot discern between their Right Hand and their Left</hi>?</p>

                     <hi>HAGGAI, ZACHARIAH</hi> and <hi>MALACHI,</hi> did all three of them live and prophecy at the time when the <hi>Jews</hi> were delivered from their <hi>Captivity</hi> in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> They exhort the People very earnestly to rebuild the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> For after that they had laid the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> every one of them apply'd themselves to the building of their own <hi>Houses,</hi> and by a careless neglect left the Building of the <hi>House of GOD</hi> at a stand; besides which, other hindrances also hapning from abroad, did much stop the advancing of the <hi>Work,</hi> as may be seen <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 6.1, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But at last the earnest <hi>Instances</hi> and reiterated <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> of these <hi>Prophets</hi> had so good an effect, that the <hi>people</hi> having taken in hand again the <hi>Building</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> (which had been stopt and interrupted from the time that they had laid the <hi>Foundations</hi> of it, full 42<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> years, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Companions of some, tho others say not so long) they finished it within four years time. See <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.14, 15, <hi>&amp;c. John</hi> 2.20.</p>
                  <p>The principal <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> makes use of in this <hi>Book,</hi> to excite the <hi>Jews</hi> to set upon the Work again, and bring it to perfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were first of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was but reasonable that <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Things,</hi> which concern the <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of GOD, and his <hi>Glory,</hi> should be preferred in our Care and Endeavours, before all <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Earthly Concerns</hi> whatsoever, and that in case of failure herein, they might expect that GOD would justly refuse them his <hi>Blessing</hi> upon their outward <hi>Affairs,</hi> which they preferr'd before his <hi>Interest.</hi> And in the next place he urges this Exhortation, because the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and preheminence of this <hi>Second Temple</hi> would by far surpass the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>First,</hi> chiefly, because <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the Son of <hi>GOD,</hi> would honour it with his <hi>presence</hi> in the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and his Preaching, and would continue from that time by his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> to dwell and take up his abode in his <hi>Church;</hi> And thirdly and lastly, because GOD would so favour and further the Work with his <hi>Blessing,</hi> that it should be finish'd in a short time. Two <hi>months</hi> after that <hi>Haggai</hi> had began to prophesie, he was second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Zachariah,</hi> who also very earnestly exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and exhorted his backward and fearful <hi>Countrymen,</hi> to continue and carry on the Work.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Book</hi> treats of many excellent Matters, whereof these are the chief: First of all, he exhorts the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were returned out of <hi>Chaldea</hi> into <hi>Palestina,</hi> to <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>amendment</hi> of their <hi>Lives.</hi> Secondly, He relates several exquisite <hi>Visions,</hi> by which GOD represents to them, how tenderly he had chosen them for his own People, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, how graciously he had delivered them from the <hi>Babylonian Bondage,</hi> with Promises from time to come to take them into his <hi>holy Protection,</hi> in case they did seriously repent, and finish the <hi>Building</hi> of the <hi>Temple.</hi> Thirdly, He foretels the <hi>destruction</hi> of the <hi>Enemies</hi> of <hi>Gods People,</hi> the Coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> his <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> and the <hi>Blessings</hi> he would shower down upon his <hi>Church,</hi> now enlarged and increased by the Calling and Conversion of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

                  <p>Many Passages of this Prophet are found quoted in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> as well by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself, as by his <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> Mat. 21.5. and 26.15, 31. and 27.9. Mark 14.27, Joh. 12.15. and 19.27. Ephes, 4.25. Rev. 1.7. Which ought the more to excite and animate to the reading and serious minding of this Prophet.</p>

                  <head>A Summary of the New TESTAMENT.</head>
                  <p>THE Word <hi>TESTAMENT</hi> is of a <hi>Latin</hi> Original; and of greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in its first signification, than is that in which it is commonly now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in ordinary Affairs: It's often used in the <hi>Translations</hi> of the <hi>Holy Writings,</hi> to express the <hi>Greek</hi> Word <hi>Diatheke,</hi> which generally sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies in our Language, <hi>The Will of the Dead;</hi> but the <hi>Greek Interpreters</hi> of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>New,</hi> do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly use it to answer the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word <hi>Berith,</hi> which properly signifies a <hi>Contract</hi> or <hi>Covenant.</hi> Thus does this Word set forth the <hi>Covenant</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> vouchsafed to enter into with <hi>Men,</hi> on performance of which, they were to have <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>GOD</hi> made two <hi>Covenants</hi> with <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New;</hi> the <hi>Old,</hi> is that which <hi>GOD</hi> made with the first <hi>Man;</hi> and in him with all his <hi>Posterity,</hi> before his <hi>Fall;</hi> in which he promis'd him <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> and gave him the <hi>Pledges</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> of it in the <hi>Tree of Life;</hi> under condition of a constant <hi>Obedience</hi> and perfect <hi>Observance</hi> of his <hi>Law:</hi> And therefore 'tis call'd the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> because <hi>GOD</hi> made it between <hi>him</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> at the first <hi>Establishment</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> it being such as the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> created after <hi>God's</hi> own <hi>Image,</hi> and his dependance on him, necessarily required. It's also call'd the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> because it exacted the <hi>Righteousness of Works,</hi> in a perfect performance of the <hi>Law.</hi> And <hi>GOD</hi> would have this his <hi>Law</hi> repeated, and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Israelites</hi> by the <hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>Moses;</hi> to the end, that observing that this <hi>Condition</hi> was generally violated by all, and from that time no body was able to accomplish it, they should be oblig'd to search their <hi>Salvation</hi> in another <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> term'd a <hi>New one;</hi> and which consists in <hi>God's</hi> vouchsafing to set up his own <hi>Son,</hi> to be a <hi>Mediator</hi> between him and us, to reconcile us to himself by the price of his <hi>Blood;</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising <hi>everlasting Life</hi> to all those who shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it, and receive him with an <hi>obedient Faith;</hi> and this is called the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These two <hi>Covenants,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> being oppos'd, as <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Sinai</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> do essentially differ from one another, For as the <hi>Law</hi> is the <hi>Contract</hi> of the first, so the <hi>Gospel</hi> is the <hi>Treaty</hi> of the second, to which the <hi>Name of Testament</hi> does more particularly agree in the strict signification of <hi>Lawyers;</hi> which becomes only of validity by the Death of the <hi>Testator,</hi> according as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Heb. 9.16.</hi> We may also distinguhsh it in respect of its different <hi>Oeconomies</hi> into <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New;</hi> This comprehends all the Administration which preceded the Manifestation and Coming of the <hi>Mediator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first <hi>Promise</hi> was made to our first <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> immediately after their Sin, <hi>Gen. 3.15.</hi> And 'tis not to be doubted, but the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and other <hi>Holy Ceremonies,</hi> which were afterwards observed till <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Time, were also subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the <hi>Order of GOD;</hi> and by his <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> to this same <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> as well to prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure the <hi>promised Seed,</hi> as to denote the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which it should <hi>bruise the Serpent's Head.</hi> And this is the cause why <hi>Abel</hi>'s <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> was approved of from his <hi>Faith, Heb. 11.4.</hi> and our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> is called <hi>the Lamb slain from the foundation of the World, Rev. 13.8.</hi> This <hi>Promise</hi> was renew'd more particularly to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>Posterity,</hi> with this assurance, <hi>That the Mediator should be of it, and that in his Seed should be blest all the Nations of the Earth, which GOD wou'd signifie and seal to him by Circumcision, Rom. 4.11.</hi> To which <hi>Moses</hi> gave the last stroak by the diverse <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of his <hi>Establishment,</hi> which in their <hi>Evangelical use,</hi> were the <hi>Shadows of good things to come, Heb. 10.1.</hi> This denotes the <hi>Administration</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> given to it by the Coming of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the <hi>Son of GOD, and Mediator of the New Covenant,</hi> who has reconciled us to <hi>GOD,</hi> actually paid the price of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> and obtain'd for us an <hi>Everlasting Deliverance.</hi> And tho' that in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance they make but one, seeing that in both one and the other, the <hi>Remission of Sins,</hi> and <hi>Everlasting Life</hi> are promis'd by <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Mediator;</hi> yet are they distinguish'd by <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Dispensations;</hi> that of the <hi>New</hi> being far clearer, less clouded with <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> and of greater extent, seeing all <hi>People</hi> are indifferently therein received, and have a part: We may call the first, <hi>The Testament of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> and the other, <hi>The Testament of the Accomplishment.</hi> Moreover under these Names

                  <p>His <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is describ'd, and clearly prov'd by the <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> given to him, of <hi>GOD; True GOD; GOD blessed over all; LORD,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah;</hi> of the only Son of <hi>GOD;</hi> of the <hi>Prince of Life; LORD of Glory; LORD over all, Sovereign Judge</hi> of the <hi>Quick</hi> and <hi>Dead; King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords.</hi>

He confirm'd the <hi>Truth</hi> of his Doctrine by so many <hi>Miracles;</hi> he purposed it with such <hi>Evidence, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Clearness;</hi> he grounded it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so firmly on the Authority of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> that his <hi>Enemies</hi> could not contradict him, but by a Spirit of <hi>Fury,</hi> and <hi>Hardness of Heart.</hi> After his <hi>Assumption</hi> into <hi>Glory,</hi> and his Triumphant <hi>Ascension</hi> into <hi>Heaven,</hi> he sent his <hi>Apostles</hi> throughout all the <hi>World,</hi> to preach <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> in his <hi>Name;</hi> and to call indifferently all <hi>People</hi> to the participation of his <hi>Benefits,</hi> and enjoyment of his <hi>Salvation.</hi> Of which they faithfully acquitted themselves as long as they liv'd, both by <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Mouth,</hi> and <hi>Writing,</hi> especially in their <hi>Epistles,</hi> wich make up a great part of the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which are to be to the End of the <hi>World,</hi> a standing Rule of <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Lord</hi> has exercis'd his <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> when having duly sanctified himself on <hi>Earth,</hi> he of his own Will offered himself in our place, as a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> without Spot or Blemish, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us both in his <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to our <hi>Sins,</hi> and Offered himself a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice</hi> to GOD his <hi>Father,</hi> for the <hi>Expiation</hi> of all our <hi>Transgressions,</hi> by the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, shameful, and cursed Death of the <hi>Cross;</hi> And therefore as he bore our <hi>Sins,</hi> they being laid on him, to discharge us of them; so GOD will impute to us this his Satisfaction, and the Merit of his Obedience and Death, to Crown it in us with <hi>Immortality</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> And as the <hi>High-Priest</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> after the Oblation of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the Outparts of the <hi>Temple,</hi> carried the <hi>Blood</hi> into the <hi>Holy place,</hi> to appear before GOD in the Name of all the <hi>People;</hi> so our great <hi>High-Priest</hi> having acquitted himself in every respect here below as in the Out-parts of the great <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Universe</hi> of this first part of his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> (which consists in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up of himself on the <hi>Cross</hi> and in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Satisfaction which he made to the Justice of GOD for all our <hi>Sins,</hi>) is entred into the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sanctuary,</hi> by vertue of his <hi>Blood,</hi> and is set down at the <hi>Right Hand</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> to represent continually to him the efficacy and price of it, and to obtain for us the application of it by his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to our entire <hi>Justification,</hi> for the Remission of all our <hi>Sins,</hi> and to make there perpetual Intercession for us.</p>
                  <p>And as to what concerns his <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of <hi>King,</hi> he has partly acquitted himself of that here below; when by his Death, he has deliver'd us from the <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Violence</hi> of our <hi>Enemies,</hi> having given several Proofs of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd the <hi>Daemons</hi> to leave the <hi>Bodies</hi> of those they possessed; when he healed the <hi>Sick</hi> of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:63323:199"/>
all Distempers, when he called the <hi>Dead</hi> out of their <hi>Graves;</hi> when he appeased the <hi>Storms,</hi> and calm'd the <hi>Tempests;</hi> when he drove out of the <hi>Temple</hi> those who polluted the holiness of that place by an infamous <hi>TRAFIC,</hi> and in fine, when he made his Triumphant (tho humble) entrance into <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> But especially in his glorious Exaltation, he now exercises this Regal Power from the highest <hi>Heavens;</hi> whence he guides and governs his <hi>Church,</hi> by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> he gathers it, protects it powerfully and miraculously in the World amongst all its <hi>Enemies,</hi> and in despite of their rage and fury; the Gates of <hi>Hell</hi> not being able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against it: He rebukes and overthrows every Power which rises against it; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains the most Obdurate, who refuse to adore him, to become his <hi>Footstool,</hi> till at length he shall return visibly from <hi>Heaven</hi> at the last day in the end of the <hi>World,</hi> to judge the <hi>Living</hi> and the <hi>Dead,</hi> to put the last hand to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Redemption and Eternal glorification of his <hi>Church</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Heaven;</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy by the <hi>Resurrection</hi> the last <hi>Enemy,</hi> which is <hi>Death;</hi> and to throw down all the wicked both in <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> with the <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Evil Angels,</hi> into the abyss of eternal Flames. And here is near upon the Summary of what's contain'd in the Books of the <hi>New Testament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Would we follow the Order, according to which they be rang'd, we may distinguish them into <hi>Historical, Didactic,</hi> and <hi>Prophetical;</hi> as are divided sometimes those of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> into <hi>Historical</hi> and <hi>Prophetical.</hi> But to make Two Parts of them, we ought to divide them into <hi>Narratives</hi> or <hi>Histories,</hi> and into <hi>Dogmatics</hi> or <hi>Doctrinals;</hi> because some of them recide <hi>Histories</hi> and <hi>Events,</hi> and others treat of <hi>Articles</hi> and chief Heads of <hi>Doctrine.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho these do sometimes relate <hi>Events</hi> and <hi>Pieces</hi> of <hi>History,</hi> and those be also fill'd and sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with several <hi>Doctrines</hi> and salutary <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> yet is this division and partition made in respect of the Order which is respectively observ'd in reference to what is chiefly treated of.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Narrative Books</hi> or <hi>Histories</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> treat either of things which have been already done or hapned, or of those which were then to come to pass. The <hi>things</hi> done and hapned are of two kinds, for they are either of what has hapned to our <hi>Saviour. Christ</hi> himself (which is to say) of what he has done, what he has suffered, and whatever has befallen him since his <hi>Birth,</hi> to his <hi>Resurrection</hi> and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Ascension;</hi> and all, or as much as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for us to know in order to <hi>salvation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contain'd in the <hi>Four Evangelists,</hi> written under the particular and immediate inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> by the <hi>Four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,</hi> (S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> S. <hi>Mark,</hi> S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and S. <hi>John;</hi>) or of what has hapned to his <hi>Holy Apostles,</hi> in the first establishment of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church,</hi> related by S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the Book of their <hi>Acts.</hi> The Events of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Doctrinal</hi> or <hi>Dogmatical Books,</hi> which principally treat of Points of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> are the <hi>Epistles</hi> of the holy <hi>Apostles,</hi> as well of S. <hi>Paul</hi> as of some others of the same rank. The <hi>Apostle</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> has wrote on divers occasions, <hi>14</hi> several <hi>Epistles;</hi> some of them being directed to particular <hi>Churches,</hi> One to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Two to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> One to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> One to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> One to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> One to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> and Two to the <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> The rest to particular persons, Two to <hi>Timothy,</hi> One to <hi>Titus,</hi> and One to <hi>Philemon;</hi> to which is to be added the <hi>14</hi>th, written to all the Nation of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and they have been most certainly to blame, who would have call'd into question, whether 'twas <hi>Canonical,</hi> and of the same <hi>Apostle.</hi> There have been also some other <hi>Apostle,</hi> who have written <hi>Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi> or <hi>Catholic Letters,</hi> for the instruction of the whole Church, S. <hi>James</hi> One, S. <hi>Peter</hi> Two, S. <hi>John</hi> Three; and S. <hi>Jude</hi> One.</p>
                  <p>These are all the several pieces of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> written as the <hi>Evangelist</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> declares, <hi>To the end we may believe that</hi> Jesus <hi>is the</hi> Christ <hi>the</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> GOD, <hi>and that in believing we may have Life through his Name,</hi> John <hi>20.31.</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> in his mercy enable us all to do, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>Oracles</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, and the time which <hi>GOD</hi> had appointed to shew forth his Mercy,<note place="margin">Anno Mundi 3999. <hi>Before the common</hi> Aera <hi>of Jesus Christ</hi> 5.</note> and give a <hi>Saviour</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> being come; The <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> was sent from <hi>GOD,</hi> First to <hi>Zacharias,</hi> when he offered Incense in the <hi>Temple,</hi> to tell him, that he should have a Son, who should be called <hi>John,</hi> whose <hi>Birth</hi> was to be the Joy and Glory of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Six months after, GOD sent the same <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> to the Holy <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where she usually lived. She was espoused to <hi>Joseph,</hi> of the House of <hi>David,</hi> whom GOD gave Her for a <hi>Guardian,</hi> and <hi>Protestor</hi> of her Innocency, being both Married, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, in a Reciprocal design of never Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, but by the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>GOD, who acted invisibly in their Souls, led them by a secret and internal Law to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this Vertue of <hi>Virginity,</hi> of which there was not then any Example of <hi>Earth;</hi> for in espousing each other, they also at the same time espoused the Reproach of <hi>Barrenness.</hi> But GOD honoured this <hi>Angelical Marriage</hi> with the most <hi>Divine Fruit,</hi> that ever appeared on <hi>Earth:</hi> And to this end, he sent the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> to the <hi>Holy Virgin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He found her alone, as S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> observes, and saluted her with an <hi>Hail Mary full of Grace,</hi> she having been filled with it from her Mothers Womb; and this Fulness, still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in her, without any Interruption, in the whole Course of her Life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Praises</hi> which the <hi>Angel</hi> gave her, in this Salutation, at first troubled her, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the <hi>Gospel.</hi> She was apprehensive of the <hi>Angels</hi> of Darkness, who transform themselves into <hi>Angels</hi> of Light: She mused in her self at what she saw, and heard, and thus taught <hi>Holy Souls,</hi> not to be rash and hasty, but to take time to judge of all things.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Angel</hi> knew her trouble, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease her, thus said; <hi>Fear not</hi> Mary, <hi>for you have found Favour with GOD.</hi> And he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards declared to her his Message, as in S. Luke, <hi>Behold thou shalt conceive in thy</hi> Womb, <hi>and bring forth a</hi> Son, <hi>and shalt call his name</hi> Jesus; <hi>he shall be great, and shall be called the</hi> Son <hi>of the most highest, and the LORD GOD shall give to him the Throne of his Father</hi> David, <hi>and he shall Reign over the House of</hi> Jacob <hi>for ever, and of his</hi> Kingdom <hi>there shall be no end,</hi> She heard without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composure, this Message of the <hi>Angel Gabriel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She only askt of the <hi>Angel</hi> how, what he had told, would come to pass, seeing she knew not a Man; She ask'd this Question without Wavering in the Faith, and without Curiosity, that she might submit her self to the Will of <hi>GOD,</hi> and follow punctually, what he had Ordained.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Angel</hi> assured her, that <hi>Man</hi> should have no part in this <hi>Work,</hi> but that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> would himself form in her the <hi>Child</hi> of which she was to be the <hi>Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He at the same time shewed her, what had hapned to S. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> assuring her, that that <hi>Holy Woman</hi> who past for <hi>Barren</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> was already Pregnant six Months; by an effect of the powerful Operations of <hi>Gods Holy Spirit,</hi> to whom not any thing was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> had received from the <hi>Angel</hi> an Answer to what she had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and had known the manner of <hi>Gods</hi> Operating in her so great a Mystery, she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied her self wholly to testifie to GOD her perfect Resignation to his Will; which she did by these humble <hi>Words,</hi> which admirably well shew the Pious Disposition of her <hi>Soul. Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, Be it unto me according to thy Word. And she said, my</hi> Soul <hi>doth magnifie the</hi> Lord, <hi>and my Spirit hath rejoyced in</hi> GOD <hi>my</hi> Saviour, <hi>for he hath regarded the low estate of his Handmaid; for behold, from henceforth all</hi> Generations <hi>shall call me blessed, for he that is Mighty hath done to me great things, and</hi> Holy <hi>is his name, and his is Mercy on all them that fear him from</hi> Generation <hi>to</hi> Generation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Angel</hi> immediately left her, endued with the same Humility, not being at all puft up at these happy Tidings.</p>
                  <p>At this Moment the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> grew In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate in her <hi>Holy Womb;</hi> And this Moment is one of the Times, which the <hi>Church</hi> has reason to Celebrate through all Generations.</p>

For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out staying to consider the high condition whereunto she was now raised, she undertook a painful <hi>Journey</hi> to visit her Cousin <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> who dwelt in the <hi>Hilly Country</hi> in the City of <hi>Juda,</hi> and entring into the House of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> saluted <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and it came to pass that when <hi>Elizabeth</hi> heard the Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Babe</hi> leaped in her <hi>Womb,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was filled with the <hi>Holy Ghost, and she spake with a loud Voice, and said, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed art thou amongst Women, and Blessed is the Fruit of thy Womb; and whence is this to me, that the Mother of my</hi> Lord <hi>should come to me? for lo! as soon as the Voice of thy Salutation sounded in my Ears, the</hi> Babe <hi>leaped in my</hi> Womb <hi>for joy.</hi> And shewed her Joy, in that <hi>GOD</hi> had at length been gracious to her, by dilivering her from the reproach of a long Barrenness.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour,</hi> whom she already saw humbled in her <hi>Bowels,</hi> seem'd to learn her to say then, what he said himself since, <hi>That she must fulfil all righteousness, and submit her self to all the offices of Humility.</hi> But when she thought only on a profound abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without discovering any thing to her <hi>Cousin,</hi> of the Favour which she had received; <hi>GOD</hi> himself did what her Modesty and love to <hi>Silence</hi> would out-do.</p>
                  <p>The Presence of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> which she carried in her Bosom had such a powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on S. <hi>John,</hi> that he testified before he was <hi>born,</hi> to be capable not only of Reason, but of Adoration. For being become the first Adorer of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> he paid him this interior Worship with an exulting Joy; which having produced the same impression in his <hi>Mother,</hi> made him then enter into the exercise of his Office of <hi>Forerunner</hi> to the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> cryed out with Joy; and being abash'd to see her come to her, whom she began to respect as the Mother of her <hi>Lord,</hi> she offered her great Praises, and admired the firmness of her Faith. But the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> who was not at all lifted up at what the <hi>Angel</hi> had told her, was no more elivated at what was said to her by her Cousin <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She considered <hi>GOD</hi> as the free disposer of his <hi>Gifts,</hi> and her Humility as the Channel by which they were conveyed to her, and she uttered that excellent <hi>Canticle,</hi> which may be called the glory of the <hi>Meek,</hi> and the confusion of the <hi>Proud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> being thus become the Mother of S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> more than she was afterwards S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangelist's,</hi> and having sanctified him, and as it were spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually begotten him in the <hi>Womb</hi> of his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> by her word, enlivened by the ever-blessed <hi>Fruit</hi> she carried within her, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for the space of three Months with S. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which being accomplish'd, and the Birth of S. <hi>John</hi> approaching the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> retired, when it might be thought more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to come, had she been absent, to partake of that great <hi>Joy</hi> which this Birth caused in the World, and of which the <hi>Church</hi> to this day conserves such great Marks. But the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> then shewed, that she followed in all things the motions of <hi>Gods Spirit;</hi> and being come to St. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at the time he appointed her, she also returned at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment denoted, without any regard at the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Customs</hi> of the World, which are not sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom contrary to the Laws of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>She also taught us by this, To retire and conceal our selves after Works of</hi> Charity <hi>to our Neighbour, not desiring to appear to have any part; that</hi> GOD <hi>may have his full due, and we that humiliation and trouble which is due to us in not being such pure and perfect Channels of his</hi> Graces, <hi>as to be free from mixtures of our own.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> being returned home from her Cousin <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> soon learnt that the great Favours which <hi>GOD</hi> bestows here on his <hi>Saints,</hi>

                     </gap> her pregnancy appearing, <hi>Joseph</hi> was in a manner forced, notwithstanding the many Proofs he had of the <hi>Virgins</hi> purity, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the work of <hi>Sin,</hi> that which was only the work of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> who could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what passed, yet remained firm in her silence, shewing thereby of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it is to keep secret the works of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> she chose rather to be esteemed by her <hi>Husband</hi> an <hi>Adulteress,</hi> then to fail in her fidelity in this point unto <hi>GOD,</hi> to whom she committed as well the care of her <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> as of her <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Joseph,</hi> who was a <hi>Just man,</hi> would not make publick the Fault, of which he supposed her guilty, and thereby gave a great example to <hi>Men, That we should keep secret the Failings of those to whom we owe love and respect.</hi> He resolved only to leave her, to shew by this means, at least, his dislike of the evil which a Person so dear to him had committed.</p>
                  <p>But when he was ready to do this, <hi>GOD</hi> hindered him, advertising him in the Night by an <hi>Angel,</hi> to take along with him <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife, and discovered the Secret of this <hi>Divine Child,</hi> enjoyning him to give him at his Birth the Name of <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joseph</hi> being comforted by the words of the <hi>Angel,</hi> learnt how reserved a Man ought to be in his censure of others, and how much we are obliged to judge always favourably of pious Persons, notwithstanding all seeming ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of their guilt. He believed what the <hi>Angel</hi> had told him, and he deserved to be called the Father of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving imitated that great Faith through which the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> became his <hi>Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the time of her Delivery was near, the divine Providence (to bring the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> out of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where the <hi>Prophets</hi> had foretold the <hi>Messias</hi> should be born) permitted, that the Edict of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Cesar Augustus</hi> (who desiring to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie either his Pride, or Covetousness, in the numbring the Families of his <hi>Empire</hi>) should in some sort disturb the whole World to make the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> come to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> with <hi>Joseph</hi> her espoused Husband, who was of that Town, and of the Lineage of <hi>David,</hi> to be taxed.</p>
                  <p>She considered not the troublesomness of so long a <hi>Journey,</hi> and the incommodiousness of the time, nor her condition; but obeying this Order of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> with the same respect as if an <hi>Angel,</hi> or even <hi>GOD</hi> himself had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired her to make this <hi>Journey:</hi> By this she taught us to have an Eye to <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>Men,</hi> who are only his <hi>Instruments,</hi> and in whom he conceals himself.</p>
                  <p>When they were arrived at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one refused to lodge them, because their <hi>Houses</hi> were full: </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>And thus did our Saviour hasten (as it were) to shew us at his very Birth an example of Humility, in suffering the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses of Men, disdaining not to be born in a Stable, to teach us to despise the glory of the World, by his aversion to it in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: And as the Scripture makes mention, That she brought forth her first born <hi>Son,</hi> and wrapped him in swadling Clothes, and laid him in a Manger, because there was no room in the Inn.</p>
                     <p>This temper of mind did he infuse into the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> who received the Repulses of those of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> in the same manner as she received the Orders of <hi>Augustus,</hi> having in both these circumstances an Eye upon <hi>GOD,</hi> to whom she obeyed in the person of an <hi>Inkee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> as she had done in that of an <hi>Emperour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She was well contented to bring forth <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in a <hi>Stable,</hi> understanding that this her Poverty would conceal her from <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Devils,</hi> and that the unkindness of this People of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was necessary to the designs of <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> tell us, There is nothing so instructive as this abasement of the Son of GOD, and that all the beauty of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do not so much oblige us to adore him, as this divine Humiliation of himself.</p>
                     <p>We ought chiefly to learn from this Infancy of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that we have no less need at all times of the assistance of <hi>GOD,</hi> than a <hi>Child</hi> newly born has of the succours of <hi>Man.</hi>

to whom he would have it known; that he would hide his Mysteries from the great and wise, and only reveal them to the simple. Even in the same Night wherein the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> brought him forth, there were near the place <hi>Shepherds</hi> in the Field <hi>watching their Flocks, and the Angel of the</hi> LORD <hi>came upon them, and the Glory of the</hi> LORD <hi>shon round about them, so that they were sore afraid; And the Angel said unto them, fear not, for behold I bring you good Tidings of great Joy, which shall be to all People; for unto you is born this day, in the City of</hi> David, <hi>a</hi> Saviour, <hi>which is</hi> Christ <hi>the</hi> LORD; <hi>and this shall be a Sign to you; ye shall find the</hi> Babe <hi>wrapt in swadling Cloaths, lying in a Manger. And suddenly there was with the Angel, a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the heavenly Host, praising</hi> GOD, <hi>and saying, Glory to</hi> GOD <hi>in the Highest, and on Earth Peace, good Will towards Men.</hi> And this according to St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> shewed the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the true <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> And what our <hi>Saviours</hi> Exemple (who is the true <hi>Shepherd</hi>) would one day produce in it.</p>
                  <p>'Twas to these <hi>Persons,</hi> that an <hi>Angel</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on a suddain, surrounded with a great Brightness, which denoted this great <hi>Divine Light,</hi> which now began to appear in the <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He told them, he brought them such glad Tidings, or good News, that would fill all People with Joy; and at the same time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to them, that the <hi>Messias,</hi> who had been so long expected, was now <hi>Born.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to confirm their belief of what he said, he sent them into <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> had foretold, should be the place of his <hi>Birth;</hi> And this humble <hi>Spirit,</hi> being not at all ashamed of the <hi>Humility</hi> of his Master, boldly told these <hi>Rustick People,</hi> that they should find in a <hi>Manger</hi> a <hi>Child</hi> wrapt up in <hi>Swadling Cloaths,</hi> and that this was he whom he meant, and who was the Expectation of all <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Angel</hi> had done speaking, there were joyned to him an Innumerable Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Angels, who sung Hymns of praise, and Adoration to</hi> GOD, <hi>and Proclaimed Peace to Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Shepherds</hi> recovering themselves at length, from the Astonishment or Trance, wherein they lay, occasioned at the sight, and Words of the <hi>Angel,</hi> determined to pass over to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to see there the Wonder that <hi>God</hi> had wrought; making haste in their Journey, to shew by their readiness, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> must not be sought with <hi>Coldness</hi> and <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</hi> And being come to the place, they found the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> with <hi>Joseph,</hi> and the <hi>Child</hi> lying in a <hi>Manger,</hi> according to what the <hi>Angel</hi> had related unto them.</p>
                  <p>This outward Meanness did not surprize them; for 'tis observed on the contrary, that they were filled with Admiration, as were all those to whom they told what they had seen, and heard from the <hi>Angel.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> in this profound <hi>Humility,</hi> in which <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself lay humbled in that manner before her <hi>Eyes,</hi> (not expecting all these things) contented her self in that State of Meanness, wherein <hi>GOD</hi>'s Providence had placed her.</p>

                        <hi>The same year of the Birth of Jesus Christ</hi> 1, <hi>before the common</hi> Aera 4.</note> and his Name was called <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> which was so named of the <hi>Angel,</hi> before his Conception in the <hi>Womb;</hi> and when the days of her <hi>Purification,</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>) were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, they brought him to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him to the <hi>LORD,</hi> as it is written in the Law of the <hi>LORD,</hi> every Male that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Womb</hi> shall be called holy to the <hi>LORD,</hi> and to offer a Sacrifice, according to that which is said in the Law of the <hi>LORD,</hi> a pair of <hi>Turtle Doves,</hi> or two young <hi>Pigeons;</hi> And this gives us the example of a true <hi>Christian,</hi> which does not too fondly Critizise on the Word of <hi>GOD,</hi> but places all its piety in a punctual observance of whatsoever it Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. For altho they were sufficiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, that this <hi>Divine Child,</hi> needed no <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> yet they expected not a particular Command from <hi>GOD,</hi> to submit to this Order.</p>
                  <p>They were so humble, that the very Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom it self became a <hi>Case of Conscience:</hi> Teaching us hereby, how much we ought to avoid our own Wisdom, and to follow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Haesitation the Wisdom which is above.</p>
                  <p>But if the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> and <hi>Joseph,</hi> are so greatly to be commended, in thus submitting themselves to the <hi>Law,</hi> 'tis more to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, should submit to it, notwithstanding the sharpness of the pain, wherewith it was accompany'd, which caused many times the Death of the Patient. He would moreover, having assumed our sinful Flesh, take also in that Flesh the mark of <hi>Sin,</hi> for the doing away of which <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi> had been ordained.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Innocent</hi> then appeared a <hi>Sinner,</hi> that <hi>Sinners</hi> might learn not to desire to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Innocent,</hi> and find reason in this Prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humiliation of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to humble themselves before <hi>GOD,</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every occasion of Humility and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffering all Injuries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GOD</hi> began to discover, in this occasion, what afterwards hapned in the Life of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> which he intermixt with Humiliation, and Glory: And having abased our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by a <hi>Circumcision</hi> so dolorous, and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he at the same time exalted him, by giving him the Adorable Name of <hi>Jesus;</hi> it being literally here True, what is said by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> That <hi>GOD</hi> hath exalted his Son to a sovereign Greatness; and that in Recompence of his deep Humility, he hath given him a Name above every Name, that at the Name of <hi>Jesus</hi> every <hi>Knee</hi> should Bow, both in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and that every <hi>Tongue</hi> should confess that <hi>Jesus</hi> is the <hi>LORD.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Devotion to this</hi> Holy Name, <hi>began with the</hi> Church, <hi>and the</hi> Fathers <hi>have taught their</hi> Children <hi>to put their Trust in it, and to call on it, with a faithful Love; And they that do it in this manner, according to St.</hi> Paul, shall be saved. <hi>For by invoking</hi> Jesus, <hi>as our only</hi> Saviour, <hi>we acknowledge, as the</hi> Fathers <hi>observe, That 'tis he alone that saves us, and that we save not our selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>JESUS CHRIST <hi>had this Name, because his</hi> Father <hi>gave it him, even before he was conceived in the Womb of the</hi> Blessed Virgin, <hi>as 'tis observed by the</hi> Evangelist. <hi>He neither usurpt, nor attributed it to himself. We must not therefore take from him, what his</hi> Father <hi>has given him, as his greatest Glory; But rather acknowledge with a deep Humility, that we bring him only</hi> Wounds, <hi>and Putrifying</hi> Sores, <hi>and that 'tis only he that can Heal us, by the Merit of his</hi> Life, <hi>and</hi> Death.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Magi,</hi> or <hi>Wise-men</hi> having perceived this <hi>Star</hi> in the <hi>East,</hi> and knowing it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted the <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they came with <hi>Presents</hi> into <hi>Judea,</hi> to pay him their Homage. King <hi>Herod</hi> who had usurpt the domination over these <hi>People,</hi> was troubled, when he heard of a new King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which waited in great Expectation for the <hi>Messias,</hi> could not hear the News of his <hi>Birth</hi> but with vast Concernment. This <hi>Prince</hi> immediately Assembled all the <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and Demanded of them in what place <hi>Christ</hi> should be <hi>Born.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Interessed Persons, whose knowledge served only to make them more Criminal, shewed by the little care they afterwards took in searching after our <hi>Saviour,</hi> 'twas only to Sell him to <hi>Herod,</hi> that they discovered <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi> to him to be the place where he was to be <hi>Born;</hi> and Citing to him the passage of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> they Maliciously supprest the end of it, which would have clearly discovered to <hi>Herod,</hi> that this <hi>Child</hi> was <hi>GOD,</hi> and which perhaps would have taken him off from all thoughts of persecuting him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herod</hi> having known this of the <hi>Priests,</hi> called secretly the <hi>Wise-men;</hi> And informed himself by them of this <hi>Star</hi> which had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them: They answered him fully to whatever he Demanded, without Fear.</p>
                  <p>They were without any dread in the midst of a <hi>City</hi> which was wholly in an uproar and Confusion; because <hi>GOD,</hi> whom they had followed, in this <hi>Journey,</hi> sustained them, in an undertaking, which was set on foot by himself. But this Hypocritical <hi>Prince,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing the design he had of killing this <hi>Child,</hi> whom he was forced to acknowledge for a <hi>GOD,</hi> hid this Deicide, which he Meditated, under the Words of a pretended Adoration, bidding the <hi>Wise-men</hi> search after this <hi>Child,</hi> and having found him, to give him notice, that he also might come and Worship him.</p>
                  <p>These Men departed from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the base Designs of this <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and seeing again the <hi>Star,</hi> they were filled with Joy; And went into the <hi>House,</hi> where it gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them; where being entred, they found the <hi>Child,</hi> with his <hi>Mother,</hi> and fell down and Worshipped him, being not withheld by the outward Poverty they saw, and offered him Mysterious Presents of <hi>Gold, Myrrhe,</hi> and <hi>Frankincense.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GOD</hi> would not suffer them afterwards to return to <hi>Herod</hi> according to their promise, because they knew not his wicked Devices; But derided the Cruel Policy of this <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and therefore warned the <hi>Wise-men</hi> in a Dream, to return another way into their own <hi>Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus did the Light of the</hi> Gentiles, (<hi>as St.</hi> Austin <hi>observes,) discover the Blindness of the</hi> Jews; <hi>for Strangers came to seek</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>in a far</hi> Country, <hi>and to Worship him whilst yet a</hi> Child: <hi>and the</hi> Jews, <hi>who were his</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Outragiously use him, as soon as they knew of his</hi> Birth. <hi>Thus does our</hi> Saviour, <hi>rather hide than discover himself in this occasion; and we ought to beware, seeing he observes still the same Measures, lest he hide himself from us, whilst he discovers himself to others.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> Purified.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FOrty Days after the Birth of the <hi>Son of</hi> GOD, the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> being too hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to dispense with the Law,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same Year of the Birth of</hi> Jesus Christ 1. <hi>before the common Aera</hi> 4.</note> (which enjoyned Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in general, to Purifie themselves) was willing to submit to a Law, of which she had no need; even as JESUS CHRIST her Son, had submitted himself to that of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> who was Holiness it self.</p>
                  <p>After such a Divine Birth, which rendred her more Pure, and more a Virgin; she went into the Temple with her Son, taking Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to mix her self with the rest of ordinary Women; to learn all those that are willing to imitate Her, to follow in all things the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished Order, without seeking any Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation from it.</p>
                  <p>And as the Law obliged to offer to GOD all the First-born, and to Ransom them by the Offering of some Animals: So our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> being Offered by his Mother, Offered himself inwardly to his Father, and presented him at this first time in his <hi>Holy Temple,</hi> a Sacrifice worthy of him.</p>
                  <p>GOD permitted not that an Action so Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine should remain hid: There was in <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> a most Holy Ancient Man, named <hi>Simeon,</hi> who was a Just Person, and filled with the Holy Spirit, and to whom the Gospel gives this Testimony, That <hi>he waited for the Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of</hi> Israel. This Holy Man being urged to come to the Temple by a motion of the Spirit, which was in him, acknowledged <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> when his Parents Offered him to GOD according to the Law, and saw thus accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished the Promise which GOD had made him, That he should not die before he saw the LORD, whom GOD would send into the World.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the light of his Faith had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this GOD, hid under the weakness of so small a Body, he took him in his Arms, and being transported with an Holy Joy, he gave Thanks unto GOD, for what he saw, by this excellent Canticle, LORD, <hi>now lettest thou thy Servant depart in Peace, according to thy Word; for mine Eyes have seen thy Salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all People; a Light to lighten the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and the glory of thy People</hi> Israel. For this Light was to shine not only amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> but moreover among all Nations.</p>
                  <p>And whilst the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired at what this Holy Man spake, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was to happen in its due time to the <hi>Son of God;</hi> an Holy Widow came moreover into the Temple, and added her publick Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to those which <hi>Simeon</hi> had already given our Saviour. Her Exemplary Life gave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to her Words: For being become a Pattern (as it were) to all Widows, after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years Marriage, she had past the rest of her Life (to her Eighty fourth Year) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in Fasting and Prayer, without depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Temple. And being so Holy in such a corrupt Age, as was that of the <hi>Jews;</hi> we Learn from her, <hi>That to serve</hi> GOD <hi>in a time wherein few do it with Sincerity, we must serve him perfectly, otherwise we shall not be strong enough to resist the Torrent of so many Ill Examples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ended the Purification of the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> and the Presentation of her Son <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the Temple, in which she has given all <hi>Christian Parents</hi> an Instruction, which ought to be the Foundation of all their Piety. For having nothing more precious than their Children, they ought (if they truly love them) to offer them to GOD, especially those amongst them which are the compleatest, and whom they love with the greatest Tenderness. They ought to fear, lest all other Love which they may have for them, proves the loss of those they love; and they cannot well keep this Pledge which GOD has put into their Hands, and of which he will require so strict an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but by Offering it without ceasing, and testifying, That they regard their Children, as belonging and depending more on GOD, than on themselves.</p>

                  <p>KIng <hi>Herod</hi> expecting still the Wise Men, to hear what Discoveries they had made, imagin'd when they came no more,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same Year of the Birth of</hi> Jesus Christ 1, <hi>before the common</hi> Aera 4.</note> that they had mocked him, attributing to the disrespect of his Person, what they had done by the sole Order of Heaven. And therefore he entred into a strange Passion; and when he heard mention of the Wonders spoken of this Child, who had been offered in the Temple, he openly manifested his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Slaying him, which he had hitherto dissembled.</p>
                  <p>He resolved to destroy this Child, to whom already the Name of King had been given, lest the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledging him for their Master, he should lose the Crown, which his Ambition had usurped.</p>
                  <p>GOD, who foresaw the Transports of this Prince, suffered him to go on, choosing rather to confound his vain Wisdom, by rendring all his Designs fruitless: He sent an Angel (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Night) to <hi>Joseph,</hi> when he thought of returning home from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> to tell him, That he should immediately take the Child and his Mother, because <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> would use all means to destroy him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joseph</hi> gave us, in this occasion, the Model of an admirable Obedience; for without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning on what the Angel told him, he took at the same moment our <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Holy Virgin;</hi> who excused not her self on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonableness of the time, which was Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, nor on the difficulty of this troublesom Journey, to go into an unknown Land, and which was wholly given to Idolatry; nor on the Angels not speaking to her self, to shew her the Order. But both of them thought only how to save the Blessed Infant from the Fury of <hi>Herod;</hi> and their Love made them willingly undertake, whatsoever might secure him from danger.</p>
                  <p>They went into this Foreign Country, to find that Safety, which was not to be had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst a People, whom GOD had delivered by so many Miracles. GOD then permitted this Flight, to comfort those of his Children, whom Fear might oblige to Fly in such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: And he thus taught the Church, that when the Persecutions of the Great Men of the World are violent, we may after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself, steal from their Fury, and retire into any Foreign Country. <hi>Jesus</hi> being then in safety, <hi>GOD</hi> permitted <hi>Herod</hi> to proceed in the full course of his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and this <hi>Prince</hi> by a Cruelty, which the most Barbarous People would abhor, put to <hi>Death</hi> all the Little Children of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the Neighbouring parts, who were under the Age of two Years, to draw him into this common ruine, who (tho' unknown to him) yet already gave him such Fear.</p>
                  <p>And this is the Sum of this Unhappy Prince's Policy, who was esteemed the greatest Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian in his time. A poor Child makes him tremble, and he in vain lays out all his Craft and Violence to destroy him. The Enterprize against this Child made him a <hi>Deicide;</hi> and he became the true representation of those, who stifle Jesus Christ in their Souls, to be thought Wise by Men. 'Tis in these great Passions, wherein <hi>GOD</hi> commonly exercises his great Judgments, and divinely punishes those who oppose him, and declare themselves openly against him.</p>
                  <p>Thus did he triumph over the Cruelty of <hi>Herod.</hi> He made use of it, to render eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy those whom this Tyrant would have destroyed: And amongst this great Slaughter of Infants, he who alone was aimed at in it, was the only Child that escaped; never was it made more evident, <hi>That the wicked do no more mischief to the Righteous, than GOD gives them power. And</hi> Christians <hi>ought to learn from these</hi> Examples, <hi>to have an Eye only to</hi> God <hi>in</hi> Men, <hi>and to consider their</hi> hatred <hi>or</hi> love, <hi>as a means which he makes use of for the Execution of his designs: Should all the</hi> People <hi>in the</hi> World <hi>unanimously conspire together, they can do nothing against what he has determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>When we are so happy as to know his</hi> Will, <hi>we have nothing to do, but to follow it without fear; and if he permits any Evil to happen, this Evil shall turn to our great Good, even as the</hi> Cruelty <hi>of</hi> Herod <hi>became such an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to these poor</hi> Innocents; <hi>seeing that in killing their</hi> Bodies, <hi>he has sanctified their</hi> Souls, <hi>and consecrated their Memory to all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi> Ages.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Joseph</hi> obeyed this new Order with the same readiness he had executed the first, and came and dwelt in the Town of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to avoid the Fury of <hi>Archelaus, Herod</hi>'s Son, who Reigned in <hi>Judea,</hi> and to accomplish the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, which foretold our Saviour should be called a <hi>Nazareen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Gospel does not take notice of any thing that past from our Saviour's Infancy to his Baptism, but only this one Action which he did at the Age of 12 Years.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Virgin, who in that inward and invisible Worship which she rendred to <hi>GOD,</hi> and of which Men could not be Witnesses, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted none of the solid Customs of Devotion in her time, but went exactly every Year with <hi>Jesus</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> (where she dwelt) to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at the Feast of the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, according to the Ordinance of the Law.</p>
                  <p>When then our Saviour was 12 Years old, after the <hi>Octave</hi> of the Feast was accomplished, his Parents returned to <hi>Nazareth;</hi> and our Blessed Saviour (whom they thought was with them) remained behind in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to <hi>Joseph</hi> and his Mother.</p>
                  <p>They Travelled a Days Journey, and sought him at Night amongst their Kindred, and Persons of their Acquaintance, who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Home as well as they, supposing he had been amongst them; but not finding him, they were extreamly troubled, and went back the Day following to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to seek him. And after three Days they found him in the Temple, sitting in the midst of the Doctors, both Hearing them, and asking them Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and rather Teaching than Learning any thing that was in dispute; insomuch, that all that heard him were astonished at his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Answers. The Holy Virgin was surprized to see him in that place and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance; and the Joy which she had to find him, succeeded the trouble which the loss of him had given her: She gently complained at his using of them so; saying, <hi>Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy Father and I have sought thee sorrowing! And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's Business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</hi> Having said these words, he returned with his Parents to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and was subject to them in all things.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Austin</hi> often represents this Example to Children, to teach and make them in love with the Obedience they owe their Parents. <hi>All the World</hi> (says this Holy Father) <hi>was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to our</hi> LORD; <hi>and yet our</hi> SAVIOUR (<hi>to whom all things were Obedient) obeyed his Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parents.</hi> He that enjoyed a <hi>Divine Liberty,</hi> makes use of it only to make him the more subject.</p>
                  <p>Parents also may learn in this History, by the Blessed Virgins Sorrow for her Son, when she mist him, what they are to do when their Children forsake them, (not to go into the Temple with our <hi>LORD,</hi> but to lose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the World) and with how many Tears and Prayers, they ought to endeavour the bringing back the Pledge wherewith <hi>GOD</hi> has entrusted them.</p>
                  <p>They are to be blamed, if they Afflict themselves for any thing else, and they ought to leave all things (as tha Holy Virgin did) to entreat our <hi>LORD,</hi> That he would come and seek with them their Children, if they are strayed; and raise them to Life, if they be <hi>Dead.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Our Lord and Saviour <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> is Baptized by his Forerunner, <hi>John the Baptist.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THirty and two Years being past since the Birth of our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> and <hi>GOD</hi> determining to draw him out of his concealed State,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Year of the common</hi> Aera 28.</note> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest him to the World, he began this by bringing S. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> (who was to be his Messenger) out of the Desert. This Saint then leaving immediately his Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, where he had led an Angelical Life, having (as the Scripture saith) this Garment of Camels Hair, with a Leather Girdle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Loyns, and his Meat being Locusts and Wild Honey; appeared on the Banks of the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> and in the Wilderness of <hi>Judea,</hi> Preaching Repentance, and Baptizing all those that came unto him; saying, <hi>Repent ye, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand: For this is he that was spoken of by the Prophet</hi> Esaias, <hi>saying, The Voice of one crying in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Prepare ye the Way of the</hi> LORD, <hi>make his Paths strait. I indeed Baptize you with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> unto Repentance; <hi>but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose Shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall Baptize you with the</hi> Holy Ghost <hi>and with</hi> Fire; <hi>whose Fan is in his Hand, and he will throughly purge his Floor, and will gather his Wheat into his Garner; but will burn up the Chaff with unquenchable Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The brightness of his Vertue, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of his Life, needed no Miracles to gain him Belief; for all People regarding him as something more than a Man, he was judged by some to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> and preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other Prophets that had appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                  <p>When therefore all <hi>Jerusalem</hi> went throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Desert, to hear this Holy Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger and Forerunner of our <hi>LORD and SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R,</hi> and to be Baptized of him; our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour went also, and hid himself amongst the Croud, by an Humility which we cannot read of without Blushing; seeing we are apt to use a thousand Arts and Tricks to distinguish our selves from the rest of Mankind, and to be pointed at by others as extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  <p>But when our <hi>LORD and SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> abased himself in this manner, <hi>GOD</hi> raised him up, and distinguish'd him from those he had mix'd himself with: For S. <hi>John</hi> being struck with a profound Respect, could not without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty resolve to pour Water on him to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize him. He that caused the chiefest Doctors of the Law to tremble, and drove them away from his Baptism, said unto Jesus Christ, <hi>That he ought to be Baptized of him,</hi> and that he made him Blush, when he desired he should Baptize him, saying, <hi>I had need to be Baptized of thee, and comest thou to me</hi>? Our <hi>LORD</hi> only answered, That he must humble himself so far; and that in the Condition wherein he was, he must submit to every Ordinance, <hi>to fulfil all Righteousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No sooner was he Baptized, but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens opened, and the Holy Spirit visibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended on him in the form of a Dove, and rested on his Head. And at the same time a Voice was heard from Heaven, giving this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony; <hi>This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Saviour immediately after this, retired to Conceal himself; but S. <hi>John</hi> continued to speak of him to all People. He endeavoured with great earnestness to persuade Men, That Jesus Christ was the <hi>Messias</hi> so often promised, and so greatly desired: And as to his own particular, he was inconsiderable; plainly and frequently telling them, That he must decrease in his Fame, and be obscured by an infinitely surpassing Light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Glory of</hi> Jesus Christ (as is observed by the Fathers) <hi>began to appear from this instant, when he humbled himself so far as to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by S.</hi> John. <hi>Our Saviour (who was the Greatest of all others) does humble himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He is Innocency it self, and yet will receive a Baptism, that declares him a Sinner. What a Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have we here? How can we desire to be thought Innocent, when we are all Guilty; to pass for</hi> Righteous, <hi>when we rre</hi> Sinners? <hi>Let us rather by an humble Acknowledgment of our</hi> Faults, <hi>seek the Remission and Forgiveness of them.</hi>

                  <head>CHRIST Tempted by the Devil.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Our Saviour <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> Tempted in the Wilderness.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS soon as our Saviour was Baptized, he shewed all the Faithful (by his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) what their Life ought to be after their Baptism,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same Year of the common</hi> Aera 30.</note> and that they ought thence forward to prepare themselves for Sufferings and Temptations; he withdrew into the Desert, or was rather led there by the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Being in this place of Solitude, where he Fasted 40 Days, and 40 Nights, he was <hi>Tempted of the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Proud Spirit not imagining, that such a Divine Person could be concealed under such a mean Outside; having exhausted in vain all his secret Arts and Temptations to circumvent him, at last resolved to try what he could do by Attacking him under a visible Form. He approached him with the greater Craft, in that he put on a great Form of Simplicity; he said unto <hi>Jesus Christ, If thou art the Son of</hi> GOD, <hi>Command these Stones, that they be made Bread.</hi> Our Saviour at these Words kept himself as concealed, as the Evil Spirit would fain have been: He only answered him by this place of Scripture, <hi>That Man does not live by Bread alone, but by every Word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the Mouth of GOD.</hi> And thus with admirable clearness taught us; That we need not fear either Hunger, or Death it self: But if we do not nourish our Souls with the Word of GOD, we are dead, or in great danger of Death, tho' we appear to the Eyes of Men to be Alive.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of Darkness was not discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at this Repulse; for considering that a <hi>Desert</hi> was not a proper place to Vanquish in, he drew our Saviour thence, and transported him on the top of a Pinacle of the Temple; bidding him, if he were <hi>the Son of GOD, to cast himself down to the Ground.</hi> And malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously abusing the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> he added, <hi>For it is Written, GOD hath given his Angels charge over thee, and in their Hands they shall hear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy Foot against a Stone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Son of GOD,</hi> who shewed us, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Victorious in the first Temptation, we ought to hope the same in the rest; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Tempter with the same Simplicity as at first, by a Passage of Scripture, <hi>Thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy GOD.</hi> This prudent Answer confounded the Pride of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and strangely provoked him: He observed no longer that outward Respect which he at first had shewed; and whereas before he had treated our Saviour as the <hi>Son of GOD,</hi> he would now have him to Worship him as <hi>GOD;</hi> and to persuade him to this, <hi>He took him up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an exceeding high Mountain, and shewed him all the Kingdoms of the World and the Glories thereof; and said unto him, All this Power will I give thee, and the glory of them,</hi> (for that is delivered to me, and to whomsoever I will, I give it) <hi>if thou therefore wilt fall down and worship me,</hi> all shall be thine.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Devil's</hi> Insolency was never before so great; he never thus dealt with any of the Saints; he contented himself with annoying them, as <hi>Job,</hi> but never required they should Worship him, as he desired our Saviour to do; whose Excellency he knew, by the Resistance he made him. But this extream Impudence was also Rebuked by a Greatness of Mind, which caused him to utter these words, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw Satan, for its written, Thou shalt worship the LORD thy GOD, and him only shalt thou serve.</hi> This Answer of our Saviour's put the Devil to flight, and the Angels came and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This</hi> Temptation <hi>of our</hi> Blessed Saviour <hi>has always afforded great</hi> Instruction <hi>and</hi> Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>to all good</hi> Men. <hi>Let us love</hi> Retirement, Fasting, <hi>and</hi> Prayer, <hi>and the</hi> Devil <hi>cannot hurt us. Let us with a</hi> Lively Faith <hi>Meditate on the</hi> Word of <hi>GOD, and 'twill prove a Divine</hi> Shield, <hi>whereby we shall be able to resist the</hi> Fiery Darts <hi>of</hi> Satan. <hi>Put we our</hi> Confidence <hi>in</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>that was</hi> Tempted, <hi>and was</hi> Victorious <hi>over the</hi> Triumpher; <hi>and all</hi> his Temptations <hi>will serve only to</hi> strengthen <hi>our</hi> Vertue, <hi>and</hi> increase <hi>our</hi> Rewards.</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Marriage</hi> being made in <hi>Cana,</hi> a Town of <hi>Galilee,</hi> where the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> was present; our <hi>Saviour</hi> also and his <hi>Disciples</hi> were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Invited.

And</hi> Jesus <hi>commanded them to fill them with</hi> Water; <hi>and they filled them to the brim.</hi> And having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly changed this <hi>Water</hi> into <hi>Wine,</hi> he commanded it to be drawn out, and given to the Governour or Master of the Feast.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Man</hi> being surprized at the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this <hi>Miraculous Wine,</hi> called the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi> and told him, He had done contrary to the common Custom; <hi>For every Man at the beginning sets forth good Wine, and when men have well drank, than that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good Wine till now.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The two <hi>Wines</hi> here spoken of, are the <hi>Wine of the World,</hi> and the <hi>Wine of Grace.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> presents the first, which is of better taste to <hi>Carnal Men,</hi> who inebriate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Sweetnesses of <hi>Worldly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,</hi> which at first appear extream pleasant to them, but at last their Taste is bitter as <hi>Wormwood.</hi> 'Twere well if Men would consider Pleasures in their <hi>Farewels,</hi> as well as in their <hi>Approaches.</hi> They begin with <hi>Smiles,</hi> but end with <hi>Sighs;</hi> they <hi>embrace</hi> us, that they may <hi>strangle</hi> us; and always accost us with a Face of <hi>Friendship,</hi> when as indeed they are our mortal <hi>Enemies.</hi> We are safe if we renounce their Acquaintance, and keep them without Doors as Strangers; for being once let in, they never fail of doing us Mischief.</p>
                  <p>The second <hi>Wine,</hi> is the <hi>Wine of Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>New Wine</hi> of the <hi>New Man,</hi> which sweetly inebriates the <hi>Soul,</hi> masters and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominates over the Carnal Reasoning, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the heart of Man by a real and perfect Conversion, that being as it were dead to himself, he may live to none but to <hi>GOD,</hi> and only relish the Spiritual Food of <hi>Heaven.</hi>

                  <p>This <hi>Jewish Doctor</hi> could not understand this great Truth, and thereby plainly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, That nothing is so contrary to Faith, as <hi>Human Arguments.</hi> He enquired of our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> How a Man could enter again into his <hi>Mothers Womb?</hi> But <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, How he (being a <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi>) could be ignorant of so weighty a matter?

He reasoned with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the marvellous effect of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> who Breatheth where he pleaseth; like the <hi>Wind, which bloweth where it listeth, and we hear the sound thereof, but know not whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He told him several other things, which made this Learned Man comprehend, by the difficulty he had of conceiving and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them, That God (to make us his Disciples) must pull down in us the foolish Edifice of our Reasonings, which will admit of nothing but what are objects of Sense.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Blessed Lord</hi> ended this Conversation by Discoveries to him of the great <hi>Love of GOD to Men,</hi> who had given them his own <hi>Son,</hi> to make them thereby eternally happy. In fine, He informed him of the chief cause of Mens <hi>Misery,</hi> That they loved <hi>Darkness</hi> better than <hi>Light,</hi> because it condemned them, by shewing the madness of their ways, until <hi>GOD</hi> gives them other <hi>Eyes,</hi> which makes them hate the Extravagancies of their Courses, and love this <hi>Light</hi> which comes from <hi>GOD,</hi> and guides them to him.</p>
                  <p>Thus did our <hi>Saviour</hi> dismiss this Eminent Person amongst the <hi>Jews;</hi> who afterwards shew'd, that this Entertainment had not been fruitless unto him, the powerful Word of <hi>God</hi> having made lasting Impressions in him.</p>
                  <p>For having at first discovered a kind of <hi>Fearful Sagacity,</hi> in not daring to come to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> but by <hi>Night;</hi> he had the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage afterwards to maintain publickly his Innocency in a full <hi>Council;</hi> and to declare at his <hi>Death,</hi> and after it, That he would have no part in the Injustice committed on his <hi>Person,</hi> when they made him suffer so cruel and shameful a <hi>Death.</hi> And so far was his <hi>Love</hi> from being lessened to our <hi>Saviour</hi> then, that on the contrary he increased the Signs of it; for he publickly brought <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes</hi> for to Embalm his <hi>Body,</hi> when it was to be laid in the <hi>Sepulchre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> observe hence, That we must not despair of the Sincerity of those, whom <hi>Fear</hi> does at present with-hold from making an open Profession of the <hi>Truth.</hi> Those weak in <hi>Faith</hi> may hide themselves for a time, to be instructed privately in the <hi>Truths</hi> of GOD, and to be nourished by them in silence, that they may afterwards publickly appear in the <hi>World,</hi> when GOD shall offer them a fit Occasion.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Prince,</hi> who had heard of the Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Excellency of his <hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi> respecting him as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> had a great Kindness for him, as is observed in the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Neither did his Love grow cold, for the freedom he used, in Reprehending him for his <hi>Incestuous</hi> Defilements.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> avoiding for a while the Malicious stroaks of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who had also counselled <hi>Herod</hi> to throw S. <hi>John</hi> into Prison, left <hi>Judea,</hi> and returned into <hi>Galilee.</hi> His Journey lay through <hi>Samaria,</hi> and by converting a <hi>Samaritan Woman,</hi> he shewed us, That oft-times in flying from the Rage of the <hi>World,</hi> we still may be profitable to <hi>Men,</hi> and that the <hi>Church</hi> generally increases by <hi>Persecution.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He made known to her all the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the <hi>New Law,</hi> which is a Spiritual Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the Worshipping of <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> At the hearing of this, the <hi>Woman</hi> replied to him, <hi>That the</hi> Messiah <hi>would come and teach them all things.</hi> To which our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> answered, That He was the Person.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>OUR <hi>Saviour</hi> being returned to <hi>Galilee,</hi> by reason of S. <hi>John</hi>'s Imprisonment, began to <hi>Preach</hi> there publickly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same year of the common</hi> Aera 30.</note> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort Men (as S. <hi>John</hi> had done) to <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> because the <hi>Kingdom of</hi> GOD was at hand. He went into the City of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and discovered to those <hi>People</hi> (buried in <hi>Darkness</hi>) a <hi>Divine Light,</hi> but which served (as was afterwards seen) only to render them the more <hi>Criminal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He accompanied his <hi>Preachings</hi> with a Gravity and Authority which extreamly distinguish'd him from all the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> He joined <hi>Actions</hi> to <hi>Words</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his <hi>Miracles</hi> every day gave fresh Testimonies to the <hi>Truths</hi> which he offered.</p>
                  <p>He healed in <hi>Cana</hi> a certain great Man's Son, that was at the point of Death. He cast a <hi>Devil</hi> out of a Man possessed; and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the <hi>Synagogue</hi> where he had wrought this <hi>Miracle,</hi> he entred into the House of S. <hi>Peter</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where he did another on the Person of his <hi>Wives Mother,</hi> whom he cured of a violent <hi>Fever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Miracle</hi> no less engaged S. <hi>Peter</hi> to follow our <hi>Saviour,</hi> than that of the <hi>Fishing</hi> had done; which struck this <hi>Disciple</hi> with such an awe, that he threw himself at our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Feet, entreating him to retire from him, being a sinful Man.</p>
                  <p>So many <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Miraculous Cures</hi> drew the <hi>Sick</hi> from all parts, who came to seek in our <hi>Saviour</hi> a Remedy for their <hi>Griefs:</hi> And the <hi>People</hi> came crowding about him, to have the double Joy of hearing his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being Witnesses of his <hi>Miracles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But his <hi>Disciples</hi> pleasing themselves with the Honour they received in following him, our <hi>Saviour</hi> instructed them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, not to expect from him a Temporal Felicity. And therefore to signifie to them their Future State, he engaged them to pass over an Arm of the <hi>Sea</hi> with him; and there arose a great <hi>Tempest</hi> in the Sea, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>Ship</hi> was covered with the <hi>Waves;</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi> being asleep, his <hi>Disciples</hi> came to him and awaked him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>LORD save us, we perish.</hi> And he said unto them, <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was to be a clear Representation to them, of what was to befal the Church in all Ages. For the <hi>Winds</hi> roaring and the <hi>Waves</hi> arising, and beating violently against the <hi>Ship,</hi> filled the <hi>Disciples</hi> with Fear, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to cry out, and to awake our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> as aforesaid; who (to shew his Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in greatest <hi>Perils</hi>) slept peaceably in the midst of the <hi>Storm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He reprehended them for their Fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and shewed them, they had nothing to fear all the time that he was with them: And then immediately arising, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Winds</hi> to be still, and the <hi>Sea</hi> to be calm; who both obeying his Voice, the Fear of his <hi>Disciples</hi> was changed into Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration at so great a Power.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Ship</hi> (says S. <hi>Austin</hi>) denotes the <hi>Church,</hi> which is in this <hi>World,</hi> as in a <hi>Sea,</hi> always troubled. <hi>GOD</hi> suffers these <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests,</hi> lest our Faith lessen: and to prevent, that the <hi>Peace</hi> we may meet with in this <hi>World</hi> should not make us forget our <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Country.</hi> 'Tis no marvel, if we be seized with <hi>Fear</hi> during the Storm; and 'tis no Fault, if we do not distrust the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from above.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Goodness of GOD</hi> having prepared this <hi>Vessel</hi> to pass over such a troublesome and dangerous <hi>Sea</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ought to commit our selves to his skilful Conduct, who will not fail to bring us to our desired <hi>Port.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Storms,</hi> instead of troubling us, ought to raise up our <hi>Spirits,</hi> seeing they have been foretold, and do bear Testimony to the Truth of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Words.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Divine Providence</hi> (which tho conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually busied, yet is always at rest) will guide in safety through the midst of the <hi>Storm,</hi> those that look upon him.

                        <hi>The same Year of the common</hi> Aera 30.</note> he likewise discovered to them, the Authority he had over the <hi>unclean Spirits,</hi> by delivering several <hi>Persons</hi> that were possessed with them. But amongst all those which he cured, there was one most considerable, as is more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly rehearsed in the <hi>Gospel;</hi> to shew us with great Horrour, the <hi>Empire</hi> which the <hi>Devils</hi> visibly exercised on <hi>Men,</hi> and with what Fury (when they tormented their <hi>Souls</hi>) they tore moreover their <hi>Bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was a <hi>Man,</hi> who for a long time had left dwelling in <hi>Houses,</hi> and made his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant abode amongst <hi>Graves,</hi> and such like solitary Places: He was Naked, and would endure no <hi>Cloaths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Endeavours were used to tie him, he broke all <hi>Cords,</hi> yea, and <hi>Chains;</hi> so that no one could tame him. He kept <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night</hi> in these <hi>doleful Abodes;</hi> where he cast forth terrible <hi>Screeks</hi> and <hi>Howlings,</hi> mangling and disfiguring his <hi>Body</hi> with stroaks of <hi>sharp Stones.</hi> In fine, the Place where he dwelt was become inaccessible to all <hi>People;</hi> no one daring to be so bold, to pass by that way.</p>
                  <p>But as soon as ever he saw <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> tho' afar off, he ran to meet him, and changing this brutish <hi>Fierceness</hi> into an <hi>Adoration</hi> full of Respect, he fell prostrate on the Ground, saying with a loud Voice; JESUS, <hi>thou Son of the Most High GOD! Wherefore dost thou come to torment me before my Time? I conjure you to leave me alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> ask'd him his Name, not that he was ignorant of it, (say the <hi>Fathers</hi>); but to fill <hi>Men</hi> with <hi>Fear,</hi> in seeing how many <hi>Devils</hi> one <hi>Man</hi> might be posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with. For this Spirit answered him, That he was called <hi>Legion,</hi> because they were several in number; and he entreated <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> That if he would cast them out of this Man, he would permit them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a great <hi>Herd of Swine,</hi> who were feeding not far off; which he did: And this <hi>Herd</hi> (to the number of 2000) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ran down a steep <hi>Rock,</hi> and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated themselves into the <hi>Sea.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Saviour</hi> sent him back to his own <hi>House,</hi> to declare the Favour which GOD had shewed him; by this, learning us the Thankfulness we ought to shew to GOD before Men, for the <hi>Mercies</hi> we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him. <hi>And when the Devil was cast out,</hi> and the Possest Man spake, <hi>the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude marvelled, saying.

                  </p>
                  <p>He cleansed immediately the Heart of this <hi>Disciple</hi> from all that greediness after Gain, which is too common amongst Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of that Rank; And made him with great Joy to follow a <hi>Poor Despised Man</hi> that was scorned, and set at Naught by the great People of the <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He only of all the <hi>Apostles</hi> who were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by our Blessed <hi>LORD,</hi> exprest the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Satisfaction he had in following him, by a <hi>Feast</hi> whereunto he invited him; by which he shewed us, That there is no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, like that, which arises from a True Conversion.</p>
                  <p>This new <hi>Convert,</hi> invited also to this <hi>Feast,</hi> several other <hi>Publicans;</hi> as if he would share the <hi>Grace</hi> he had received, with those, to whom he had been United in his former Life.</p>
                  <p>The proud <hi>Pharisees</hi> were scandalized, to see our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> eat publickly, with Persons whom the <hi>Jews</hi> abhorred. But our <hi>Saviour</hi> confounded their Pride, by telling them, he was the <hi>Soul</hi>'s Physician, and that he could do no Good to any, but such as acknowledged themselves to be great <hi>Sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He moreover in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> wrought a famous <hi>Bodily Cure,</hi> on one troubled with the <hi>Palsie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>House</hi> wherein our <hi>LORD</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> entred, being so full of People, that those who brought this <hi>Paralytick,</hi> knew not how to bring him in before our <hi>Saviour:</hi> They at last fell on a Determination, which was an evident Mark of their great <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ascended to the top of the <hi>House,</hi> and uncovering it, let down their sick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son before <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who admiring their <hi>Faith,</hi> bid the sick of the <hi>Palsie,</hi> be of good cheer, for his <hi>Sins</hi> were forgiven him.</p>
                  <p>This Man had certainly good reason to be Cheerful; For what better News can any Man hear, what Words can be more comfortable, than these of our <hi>Saviour</hi>? Which made the <hi>Psalmist</hi> cry out as it were with an <hi>Extacy,</hi> Blessed is the Man whose Transgressions are remitted, and whose Sins are covered: And in the Sense of this he exults, saying, <hi>Thou hast put Gladness into my Heart,</hi> I will therefore lay me down in Peace, and take my Rest. Thou shalt open my <hi>Lips,</hi> O <hi>LORD,</hi> and my <hi>Mouth</hi> shall shew forth thy Praise. My <hi>Song</hi> shall be always of the loving Kindness of the <hi>LORD;</hi> with my <hi>Mouth</hi> will I be ever shewing of thy Truth from one Generation to another.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> took these Words, immediately for <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> Mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themselves, that 'twas only <hi>GOD</hi> that could remit <hi>Sins.</hi> But our <hi>Saviour</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that he was <hi>GOD,</hi> assured them of the inward Health of this Man, by the outward <hi>Cure</hi> which he had wrought on his <hi>Body;</hi> and shewed them, that he had effectually remitted his <hi>Sins,</hi> by delivering him from the <hi>Palsie.</hi>

                  <p>OUR <hi>Saviour Christ's</hi> drawing <hi>Disciples</hi> after him, would have been of small Advantage to us, had not his Concern for the <hi>Church</hi> in future Ages,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In the Year of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Aera <hi>of Christians</hi> 31. <hi>second after Christ's Preachings.</hi>
                     </note> made him choose out of this number, twelve Persons, whom he designed for its Foundation, honouring them on this Account, with the particular Title of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> as being to be sent to <hi>preach</hi> his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> throughout all the <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having separated them once already from the rest of Men, he now again separated them from the rest of the <hi>Disciples;</hi> to make them understand by this double Separation, that they ought to have a double Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Vertue;</hi> and to excel as much, the common <hi>Disciples,</hi> as those <hi>Disciples</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the common sort of <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They had this Advantage above the rest; That they were (as it were) the <hi>Domesticks</hi> of our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> and lived with him in the same <hi>House;</hi> For we know he kept the <hi>Passover,</hi> and eat the <hi>Lamb</hi> with them alone; so that they were <hi>Witnesses,</hi> not only of his <hi>Actions,</hi> and publick <hi>Preachings,</hi> but of his private <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Secrets,</hi> after he had discoursed to others in <hi>Parables.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Choice of the <hi>Twelve Apostles</hi> was preceded by <hi>Prayers,</hi> in which our <hi>Saviour</hi> is said to have spent the <hi>Night;</hi> to learn his <hi>Church</hi> what she ought to do in future <hi>Ages,</hi> in the Election of her <hi>Ministers;</hi> to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish those whom <hi>GOD</hi> had chosen.</p>
                  <p>As soon as he had made this Choice, he led them up a <hi>Mountain,</hi> being followed by a great Croud of <hi>People:</hi> And then he made them that famous Discourse, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Sermon on the Mount;</hi> which contains the whole <hi>Gospel,</hi> and all necessary <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Behaviour,</hi> as well for the <hi>Ministers,</hi> as for the <hi>People: Saying,</hi> Blessed <hi>are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Blessed <hi>are they that Mourn, for they shall be Comforted.</hi> Blessed <hi>are the Meek, for they shall inherit the Earth:</hi> Blessed <hi>are they that hunger and thirst after Righteousness, for they shall be filled.</hi> Blessed <hi>are the Merciful, for they shall obtain Mercy.</hi> Blessed <hi>are the Pure in Heart, for they shall see GOD.</hi> Blessed <hi>are the Peace-makers, for they shall be called the Children of GOD.</hi> Blessed <hi>are they that shall be Persecuted for Righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Blessed <hi>are ye when Men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of Evil against you falsely for my sake; rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your Reward in Heaven; for so persecuted they the</hi> Prophets <hi>which were before you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having at the beginning of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> overthrown all the <hi>Judgments</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and all the Notices of Natural Reason; in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling those <hi>Happy,</hi> whom the <hi>World</hi> esteems <hi>Miserable;</hi> He afterwards shewed, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable the Ordinances of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Law,</hi> are in Comparison of the <hi>Precepts</hi> of his <hi>Gospel;</hi> plainly telling them he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of his <hi>Disciples,</hi> such a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as far exceeded that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> without which he declared they could not enter into the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He taught us by these <hi>Words:</hi> That he will not be pleased with our abstaining from things, which are apparently Evil to others Sight; nor with the doing of such things, as have the Face of <hi>good Works,</hi> which may gain us Esteem from <hi>Men;</hi> this being a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common thing amongst the <hi>Pharisees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore he enjoyns us toward the end of his <hi>Sermon,</hi> not to lay up Treasures on <hi>Earth,</hi> lest our Hearts be there where our <hi>Treasure</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Eye</hi> of our Intentions be Pure and Simple, that it may sanctifie the whole Body of our <hi>Actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we have but one <hi>Master,</hi> and that we do not share our selves betwixt <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and the <hi>World:</hi> And that we seek only the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the Righteousness thereof; to the end the rest may be given us as an <hi>Overplus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which clearly shews us, That the end of the new <hi>Law,</hi> is to give a new <hi>Heart</hi> to the new <hi>Man;</hi> because our outward <hi>Actions</hi> must be regulated by the inward <hi>Principles</hi> of our <hi>Minds;</hi> for the <hi>River</hi> cannot be Pure, if the <hi>Fountain</hi> be corrupted.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He shewed his principal Design was, to regulate the <hi>Heart,</hi> and to reduce it to such an Order, that it should abominate the least Inclination to <hi>Sin.</hi> Wherefore having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the entertaining the smallest <hi>Desires</hi> to Revenge, he afterwards prohibits <hi>Injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Words;</hi> because a peaceable <hi>Mind,</hi> and a well governed <hi>Tongue,</hi> are the best outward Signs of a True <hi>Christian Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> chief Endeavours were to satisfie the <hi>Eyes</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> whereas True <hi>Christians</hi> seek only to do what is well pleasing in the Sight of <hi>GOD,</hi> who looks into the <hi>Heart</hi> So that our Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> seems to respect the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> as containing only Precepts of lesser Excellency; whereas he gives the Name of <hi>Great Commandments,</hi> to this keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Tongue;</hi> which stifle all Motions to <hi>Wrath</hi> and evil <hi>Speaking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> under the Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of two such small things, conceals all the greatness of <hi>Christianity.</hi> It seems, as if he did not much value the Forbearance from <hi>Murther,</hi> because this may happen without any inward Vertue, <hi>Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> often hindering it.</p>
                  <p>But that which he most esteemed was, not to murmur inwardly against ones <hi>Brother;</hi> because the Forbearance of this, must hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from an excellent Principle. For the rise of <hi>Great Sins,</hi> comes from these <hi>small Beginnings,</hi> of which we take no Notice.</p>
                  <p>It being certain, <hi>That he which fears to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure a Man in Word, cannot fall into the Sin of Murther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore do's our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part of his Discourse, so greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to us the Love of our <hi>Enemies;</hi> by which he saith, we become like to his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who causeth his <hi>Sun</hi> to shine, both on the <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Unjust.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But one of the <hi>Commandments,</hi> on which our <hi>Saviour</hi> do's most insist in this <hi>Sermon,</hi> is the <hi>Precept</hi> of <hi>not judging our Brother.</hi> For seeing a natural Inclination in the bottom of <hi>Mens Hearts</hi> of judging others, he bounds this Liberty, telling us, that by our rash Judments, we are like unto a Man, that having a <hi>Beam</hi> in his own <hi>Eye,</hi> yet would pull out the <hi>Mote</hi> out of his <hi>Brothers Eye:</hi> As the Scripture saith, <hi>Judge not, lest ye be Judged; for with what Judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what Measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the Mote that is in thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Eye, but considerest not the Beam in thine own Eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy Brother, Let me pull out the Mote out of thine Eye, and behold a Beam in thine own? Thou</hi> Hypocrite, <hi>first cast out the Beam out of thine own Eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the Mote out of thy Brother's Eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>World</hi> is full of Offences of this kind, say the <hi>Fathers;</hi> but the greatest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy they could find against them, is <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility:</hi> The having low Thoughts of our selves, which will hinder us from having mean Thoughts of others. So that either our <hi>Charity,</hi> or <hi>Humility</hi> must suppress in us, all these rash Judgings; and if neither of them will do it, then will Fear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain us, by remembring the Day, in which <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> shall come to judge the smallest Defects, which are to be found in our good <hi>Works,</hi> which often deceive both our selves and others.</p>
                  <p>He do's assure us, he will deal out to us, the same <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> we have given others.</p>
                  <p>He that seriously thinks on this <hi>Judgment,</hi> cannot judge his <hi>Brother,</hi> much less make himself a pleasant entertainment of his Faults. <hi>Charity</hi> makes us take all things by the best Handle, and practise the Advice of an Holy <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>OUR <hi>Saviour,</hi> being come down from the <hi>Mountain,</hi> where he had establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed all the Rules of <hi>Christian Morality,</hi>

wrought two <hi>Miracles</hi> related in the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first was the <hi>Leprous Person,</hi> who in the manner he approaches our <hi>Saviour,</hi> gives us an excellent Model of <hi>Prayer.</hi> For as soon as he had perceived him, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him his <hi>Saviour,</hi> and by Vertue of this <hi>Faith,</hi> he saith to him with an inward <hi>Humility</hi> of <hi>Soul,</hi> which he testified by his outward Gestures, <hi>LORD if thou wilt thou can'st make me Clean;</hi> Shewing on the one Hand, what was his <hi>Faith,</hi> and on the other his Submission to the Will of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> had Compassion on him, and stretching out his Hand to touch him, saith unto him, <hi>I will, be thou clean;</hi> to approve what this Man had declared, and to shew us, that his <hi>Will</hi> alone, is the Source of all those <hi>Graces</hi> which they receive, whom he has loved with an <hi>everlasting Love,</hi> when he saw nothing in them but <hi>Bruises</hi> and <hi>Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Sores.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having <hi>Healed</hi> this Man, and forbidden him to make known this <hi>Miraculous Cure,</hi> (which teacheth us to conceal the secret <hi>Graces</hi> that he bestows on us,) as soon as he was entred into <hi>Capernaum,</hi> a <hi>Centurion,</hi> who was extreamly troubled at the Sickness of his Servant, who was at the Point of Death; sent some <hi>Jews</hi> to request him, to come and heal this Sick Person.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> came to him, to entreat this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at his Hands, and urged in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, that this <hi>Centurion</hi> had built them a <hi>Synagogue:</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> yielded to their Request, and went with them to the House where this Sick Man lay. But as he drew near, this <hi>Centurion,</hi> who had a more lively <hi>Faith,</hi> than all the <hi>Jews;</hi> sent his most intimate Friend to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to entreat him, not to be at the trouble to come to his <hi>Lodging,</hi> because he was unworthy of so great an Honour; and that it was for that reason, he dared not wait upon him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; That he knew, he needed but speak the <hi>Word,</hi> and his <hi>Servant</hi> would be <hi>Healed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Blessed <hi>LORD</hi> admired the <hi>Faith</hi> of this <hi>Centurion;</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> has so admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, after his <hi>Example,</hi> that she offers it continually as a Model to her <hi>Children,</hi> and puts the Words of this <hi>Holy Man,</hi> into the Mouths of her <hi>Ministers and People,</hi> when they are ready to receive the same <hi>LORD,</hi> to whom this great Man spake.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to draw the Instruction which our <hi>Saviour Jesus Christ</hi> and his <hi>Spouse,</hi> would have us to draw from so great an Example, we ought to have in Imitation of this <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> a profound <hi>Humility</hi> of <hi>Soul;</hi> and to believe our selves unworthy to offer up the least Request to our <hi>Saviour.</hi> For he must hear us, for his own Merits sake, and not for any thing that is in us, to make our <hi>Prayers</hi> acceptable.</p>
                  <p>We ought also to believe, as say the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> That the least Word of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> can Operate, if he pleaseth, as great Effects in our <hi>Souls,</hi> as his <hi>Divine Body.</hi> For this <hi>Centurion,</hi> did in effect, receive by the sole Word of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> the same <hi>Grace,</hi> as if he had received his Presence.</p>
                  <p>Our Blessed <hi>LORD</hi> would surrender him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to his <hi>Humility;</hi> and in some sort, be Obedient to Him: He abstained from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, because he would not render him confused.</p>
                  <p>But in not entring the House himself, says St. <hi>Austin,</hi> he made an invisible Vertue enter in, which cured the Sickness of his <hi>Servant;</hi> and if he visited him not in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> 'twas to visit him more happily by his <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> have taken occasion, from the <hi>Charity</hi> of this <hi>Centurion,</hi> towards his <hi>Servant;</hi> to recommend to all Persons in the <hi>World,</hi> the care of their <hi>Domesticks,</hi> especially when they are Sick. 'Tis in these Occasions, wherein they must testifie to <hi>GOD,</hi> that they know both Poor and Rich are equal; and that if they will have him to have pity on them as the <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>GOD;</hi> they ought also to be Compassionate to those that serve them.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter the cure of so many several <hi>Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> did that which was more surprizing; which is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same Year</hi> 31.</note> the Miracle of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> from the Dead. The first, which the <hi>Holy Gospel</hi> denotes, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> raised up to Life, is a young <hi>Damsel,</hi> aged Twelve Years, who was Daughter to to a Ruler of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> named <hi>Jairus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There appeared nothing extraordinary in this <hi>Miracle,</hi> nor in the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> who being on this Account, of a Temper different from the <hi>Centurion,</hi> suffered our <hi>Saviour</hi> to come to his <hi>House;</hi> nor in the <hi>Faith</hi> of this <hi>Damsel</hi> that was raised up, of whose acknowledgment, the <hi>Gospel</hi> makes no mention; nor in that of those, who were present; seeing on the contrary they derided our blessed <hi>LORD,</hi> for saying this young <hi>Damsel slept,</hi> and was not dead.</p>
                  <p>The second <hi>Resurrection,</hi> we read of in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> contains something more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as will appear by what follows.</p>
                  <p>When our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> went into the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>NAIM,</hi> accompanied by his <hi>Disciples,</hi> and a great Croud of <hi>People,</hi> he met with a dead <hi>Corps</hi> at the Gates of the <hi>Town,</hi> that was going to be buried, which was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Son</hi> of a <hi>Widow,</hi> who much lamented his Death. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> was moved with Compassion at the Sight, and though she spake not to him, yet her Tears called aloud for Compassion. He drew near to her, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>id her hold her Peace; and then stopping those that carried this dead Body, he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the <hi>Bier,</hi> whereon this young Man lay, and bid him arise, which he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did, and he delivered him to his <hi>Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Miracle</hi> contains great <hi>Instructions,</hi> as is observed by the Ancient <hi>Fathers.</hi> We hence learn, that nothing happens by Chance; and that whatever appears to Men, to be a meer Accident, is a real Design in <hi>GOD;</hi> for our <hi>Saviour</hi> came by on purpose, to raise this dead Man to Life. We may here Remark, That these <hi>Bearers</hi> whom <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> stops in the Way, are the <hi>Devils,</hi> which carry the <hi>Soul</hi> into <hi>Hell,</hi> which is its last resting Place; and the <hi>Sinners Grave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Bearers</hi> are really horrible; whence we may truly judge, that the <hi>Soul</hi> of a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> is but a meer inanimate <hi>Corps,</hi> that is not able to stir it self, unless the <hi>Devils</hi> bear it up and move it, as they are said to enter into the dead Bodies of wicked Persons to appear visible to our Sight.</p>
                  <p>And therefore this Circumstance of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> agrees with what is said in another Place of the same <hi>Writings:</hi> That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> must first bind the strong Man, to spoil him of his <hi>Vessels,</hi> which is to say, the <hi>Soul,</hi> in which he inhabits, as in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Dwelling. And in effect when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Difficulty there is in converting a <hi>Soul,</hi> that is a Slave to <hi>Lust;</hi> we find it so great, that it cannot be done, unless our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> do's first tie up the <hi>Devils,</hi> to make this Man love that, which before he abhorred</p>
                  <p>Our blessed <hi>LORD,</hi> having restored this young Man to Life, he gave him to his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to whom he belonged; as well for that she had brought him into the <hi>World,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, because she had restored him again to it by her <hi>Prayers,</hi> which shews us our great Obligation to the <hi>Church;</hi> and that we are not able sufficiently to requite the great care she has took of us. And therefore the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> have said, That these dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again raised up by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> ought after their Conversion, to be in Mourning with the <hi>Divine Mother,</hi> to obtain altogether the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of their <hi>Brethren,</hi> whose Death she still bewails.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Twere well if</hi> People <hi>would consider the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations they have to their Parents, to whom, next to</hi> GOD <hi>they are most Indebted. We have more reason to love them, than they have to love us. But 'tis true, they are led by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be infinitely kind to us, and we should be led by Reason to be infinitely grateful to them. Yet we see, when</hi> Parents <hi>grow old, and need their</hi> Childrens <hi>Assistance, how seldom is it chearfully given them? For whatsoever they do for them, seems to be more Burdensom, than what they will do perhaps for those to whom they have no Obligation.</hi>

                        <hi>The same Year</hi> 31.</note> spreading over all Parts; the <hi>Disciples</hi> of S. <hi>John,</hi> informed him of them in <hi>Prison,</hi> where <hi>Herod</hi> had thrown him.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Holy Man</hi> having no other intention than the discovering of our <hi>Saviour</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> as knowing he had his Life for that purpose; he continued still, in some sort, to do the Work, he came for; at least, as much as he could; and therefore, he desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to force, as it were, our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself to declare, that he was the <hi>Messias,</hi> in the Presence of some of his <hi>Disciples,</hi> which he sent to him, not to entreat him, to deliver him from <hi>Prison;</hi> but to enquire of him, if he were the Person, the <hi>World</hi> had so long expected. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> knowing that the <hi>Disciples</hi> of S. <hi>John</hi> did, in some sort, envy him, as excelling their <hi>Master,</hi> he therefore would not say any thing, which might appear ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous of himself, but rather chose to do some <hi>Miracles</hi> before them, and enjoyned them to relate to S. <hi>John</hi> what they had seen.</p>
                  <p>When they were gone, our <hi>Saviour</hi> took occasion from this <hi>Deputation,</hi> to speak of S. <hi>John</hi> before the <hi>People,</hi> and to praise that Firmness and Constancy of Mind, wherewith he was endued; <hi>That is not like our Tempers,</hi> which are as <hi>Reeds</hi> shaken with the <hi>Wind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the Life of this <hi>Holy Man</hi> had been attended with great <hi>Austerities</hi> and <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;</hi> so our <hi>Lord</hi> declared, that it must be with great <hi>Strivings</hi> and <hi>Watchfulness</hi> that a Man can be saved: That the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> could not be taken, otherwise than by a long <hi>Siege,</hi> and violent <hi>Storm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He declared the miserable Circumstances, which some <hi>Cities</hi> lay under, where he had shewed great Joy, at the hearing of his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi> because they had not given any To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of their Amendment; saying, that it will be more tolerable, for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> at the Day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> than for them.</p>
                  <p>But the generality of <hi>Men,</hi> being strangely hardened, and bare <hi>Discourses</hi> not being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to work a <hi>Reformation</hi> in them; our <hi>Saviour</hi> therefore, would bring them to it, by a Famous <hi>Example,</hi> which was that of the blessed <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Holy Sinner,</hi> moved by the <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> came running to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as the only <hi>Physician</hi> of her <hi>Soul.</hi> And therefore knowing that he had entred into the House of <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> to Eat there; she came thither with an <hi>Holy Boldness;</hi> and without Blushing, at so many <hi>Witnesses,</hi> she threw her self at his <hi>Feet, Embraced</hi> them, <hi>Kissed</hi> them, <hi>Wash'd</hi> them with her <hi>Tears,</hi> and wiped them with the <hi>Hair</hi> of her <hi>Head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who knew this <hi>Woman,</hi> (for the Irregularity of her Life, had made her infamous, throughout all the <hi>Town;</hi>) began to doubt, whether our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> was a <hi>Prophet,</hi> seeing he knew not who she was, that had dared to touch Him; doubting not, but if he had known her, he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected her. But our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the vain Imagination of this <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> learnt him, how much he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Fervent Love</hi> of this <hi>Sinner,</hi> to the Lukewarmness of those who had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted such great <hi>Crimes.</hi> And having shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Multitude of her <hi>Sins</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, because she loved much, he sent her away in <hi>Peace,</hi> after this holy Action.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Woman,</hi> as is observ'd by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> has given in her Person a compleat Pattern of <hi>Repentance,</hi> in which there is nothing wanting but <hi>Words;</hi> to shew, That <hi>GOD</hi> doth not much value them, in such a case; seeing they are only the Leaves of <hi>Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She now employs to a Vertuous use, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever she had before abused to Vice. She now offers to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as many <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> as she before had made to the <hi>Devil;</hi> and now <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to <hi>Repentance,</hi> whatever she had heretofore offered up to <hi>Luxury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This so admirable a Conversion may be called the Glory of <hi>Repentance;</hi> for it shews us, that the greatest <hi>Sinner,</hi> becomes pure in the sight of <hi>GOD,</hi> when his <hi>Repentance</hi> is Sanctified by <hi>Humility:</hi> and that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Chastest <hi>Soul</hi> is impure in his sight, when this Heavenly Gift, which should ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him the most humble of <hi>Men,</hi> does on the contray, make him <hi>Proud.</hi>

                  <p>OUR blessed <hi>Lord,</hi> being one day sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with great Crowds of <hi>People</hi> Entred into a <hi>Ship;</hi> and putting off,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same Year</hi> 31.</note> some small distance from the Land, he sat down in it, and thence taught the <hi>People,</hi> instructing them by many <hi>Parables.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He told them in that of the <hi>Sower,</hi> that the <hi>Husbandman</hi> sowing his <hi>Seed,</hi> part of it fell out of the <hi>Field,</hi> into the way side; and there was trodden under foot, or eaten by the <hi>Fowls.</hi> And afterwards Explaining pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately this <hi>Parable,</hi> to his <hi>Disciples;</hi> he told them, that these <hi>Persons</hi> are those, who hear the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and from whose <hi>Hearts,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> at the same time comes and takes it away; lest they should believe, and be saved.</p>
                  <p>For this <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Darkness</hi> who often mixes his <hi>Tares</hi> with the <hi>Wheat,</hi> as our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> observes in the following <hi>Parable,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways endeavours at the same time that <hi>GOD</hi> Sows his good <hi>Seed</hi> in our <hi>Souls,</hi> to produce their Conversion, to destroy it, either by himself, or by Men that are his <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> lest it should take deep Root in our <hi>Hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> is, that which fell on <hi>Stony Ground;</hi> which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to take Root, soon withers at the <hi>Sun</hi>'s Appearance.</p>
                  <p>And these are those, says our <hi>Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> who hear the <hi>Word</hi> with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but taking no <hi>Root,</hi> are discomposed, and lost, at the least <hi>Affliction,</hi> or <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> which may happen, because of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis easie for those Persons to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to be Ignorant, that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this delight which they have in the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> yet their <hi>Hearts</hi> are as hard as <hi>Stone,</hi> and that they have need of softening them by continual Exercises of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third part of the <hi>Seed,</hi> falls among <hi>Thorns,</hi> which grow up with the good <hi>Grain,</hi> and Choak it. And these <hi>Persons,</hi> says our <hi>Saviour,</hi> are those, who hear the <hi>Word;</hi> But the <hi>Cares and Troubles of this World,</hi> the deceitfulness of <hi>Riches,</hi> and an infinite number of inordinate desires, stifle this <hi>Word,</hi> and render it fruitless. For 'tis too evident, that the Cares of this <hi>World,</hi> make us apply our <hi>Minds</hi> with less Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what <hi>GOD,</hi> or his <hi>Ministers</hi> speak to us.</p>
                  <p>We cannot sufficiently enough Lament before <hi>GOD,</hi> the mischief which these secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Concerns bring along with them; kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us so frequently this Precious <hi>Seed,</hi> after several Acts of Devotion have made it spring up in us. For all the Miseries which respect the Body, as <hi>Plague, War, Famine,</hi> &amp;c. are not Subjects worthy of our <hi>Tears,</hi> so much as the loss of this <hi>Divine Seed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, the fourth part of this good <hi>Grain</hi> falls on good <hi>Ground,</hi> which soon springs up, and brings forth good <hi>Fruit,</hi> although not all alike; some <hi>Grains</hi> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one <hi>Hundred</hi> fold for one, others <hi>Sixty,</hi> and others <hi>Thirty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Persons,</hi> says our <hi>Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> are those who have their <hi>Hearts</hi> not only good, but very good. If the <hi>Heart</hi> be simply good, it is exposed to two great Evils, to one, that it bears small <hi>Fruit,</hi> and the other, that it easily becomes Bad: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must endeavour, how good soever it is, to make it better; which is done by increasing in <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Saviour Jesus Christ</hi> doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self observe, that 'tis only by <hi>Patience,</hi> that we bear much <hi>Fruit,</hi> that is to say, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during many <hi>Afflictions,</hi> which do in some sort Cultivate our <hi>Fields,</hi> and renders our <hi>Charity</hi> more Vigorous. For she is the Root of all good <hi>Fruit,</hi> and the stronger that this Root is, the more excellent is the <hi>Fruit,</hi> which springs from it, proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Condition and Rank of each true <hi>Believer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Afflictions</hi> overthrow the Weak, as 'tis observable touching the second <hi>Seed;</hi> but become, on the contrary, the Exercise and Crown of the Strong.</p>

                  <p>They could not reconcile what was said touching the great things he did, with what they beheld in his <hi>Person.</hi> They saw on one hand his <hi>Poverty,</hi> the mean condition of his <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Kindred;</hi> and on the other, the great <hi>Miracles</hi> which were publish'd of him; and the Applauses of the <hi>People.</hi> In fine, their Pride (being offended at this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Fame of our <hi>Saviour</hi>) made them contrive to precipitate him from the Top of the <hi>Mountain</hi> whereon their <hi>Town</hi> stood.</p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s hour was not then come, neither was it in the power of any Man to hasten it; so that passing through the midst of them, he rendred ineffectual their wicked design.</p>
                  <p>Our blessed <hi>Lord</hi> well understanding the Aversion they had to him, would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preach in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> but in <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,</hi> and other circumjacent <hi>Towns;</hi> as well to humble himself, as to shew us, that we ought to avoid all pompous Appearances in a place where we have before lived in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity; as also to dispose by degrees those of <hi>Nazareth</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by his <hi>Absence,</hi> to believe in him, as well as others, and to respect him for the time to come whom they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore despised.</p>
                  <p>But the hardness of their <hi>Hearts</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable, our <hi>Saviour</hi> contented himself with Working some few <hi>Miracles</hi> to shew that he did not slight them; and he did no more, lest he should make them more Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>
                  <p>He past then from them, and leaving <hi>Nazareth</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had News brought him of the Death of S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> which hapned in this manner.</p>

                  <p>S. <hi>John</hi>'s Head was cut off in <hi>Prison,</hi> and delivered to <hi>Herodias</hi>'s Daughter in a <hi>Charger;</hi> who immediately came, and brought it to her <hi>Mother</hi>

                  <p>'Tis strange, says S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> that such infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>People</hi> should have that Power over so <hi>Divine</hi> a <hi>Person</hi> as S. <hi>John:</hi> But if his Life was precious in the eyes of GOD, it was not so in his own; and one may say that <hi>GOD</hi> seconding his <hi>Humility,</hi> and considering how little he valued it, gave it therefore for a <hi>Dance;</hi> by which, adds this <hi>Holy Father,</hi> the Servants of <hi>GOD</hi> may learn to despise their own <hi>Lives,</hi> and be willing they should be at the Mercy of cruel and wicked <hi>People;</hi> for in sacrificing them to <hi>GOD</hi> for and to whom alone they live, their Death, like S. <hi>John</hi>'s, will be the more estimable, and acceptable in the sight of <hi>GOD</hi>

taking his <hi>Disciples</hi> along with him, to learn his <hi>Church</hi> to retire to places of Retreat in times of Danger.

                  <p>Such Imaginations as these trouble the Repose of this wicked <hi>Prince;</hi> whilst our <hi>Saviour</hi> was Retired into the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> where <hi>Herod</hi> could not hinder the <hi>People</hi> from Running after him: for he was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by near five thousand Persons, who were continually attentive to his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</hi> Their <hi>Minds,</hi> were so taken up with what they saw and heard from him, that they forgot to take along with them their necessary <hi>Provisions.</hi> And three <hi>Days</hi> being already past since they left their Habitations to follow <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the <hi>Desert;</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> was moved with Compassion in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these <hi>Persons,</hi> and spake to his <hi>Disciples</hi> about the procuring of them Sustenance: They answered him, that the place, where they were, was a <hi>Desert,</hi> far distant from <hi>Towns,</hi> and that they had no other <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> than five <hi>Barly Loaves,</hi> and some few <hi>Fishes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> commanded the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> to cause them to sit down, in divers Companies; and when this was done, lifting up his <hi>Eyes</hi> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> he blessed these <hi>Loaves</hi> and gave them to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> that they might share them amongst the <hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Loaves</hi> Multiplyed themselves in our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Hands; for all the <hi>People</hi> Eat of them, and were satisfied; and our <hi>Saviour</hi> commanded his <hi>Disciples</hi> to gather up the Fragments with great care, with which were filled Twelve <hi>Baskets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> have ever regarded these five thousand Men that followed our <hi>Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> as a Type of true <hi>Christians,</hi> who forsake the <hi>World,</hi> at least their Hearts, to follow <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he calls them.</p>
                  <p>There is observable in their whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, an excellent Image, or Representation of the <hi>Church.</hi> They are attentive to the Words of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and expect no relief on Earth, but from his Bounty. They all appear but as one single Man. They have all the same <hi>Affections,</hi> the same <hi>Inclinations,</hi> and the same end, whereto they tend by the same means. They continue in this <hi>Desert,</hi> and grow not weary of our <hi>Saviours</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. They persist therein, till they Faint, without Murmuring for Sustenance. And therefore our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> seeing their great <hi>Faith,</hi> stays till the third day before he feeds them, and though his <hi>Charity</hi> was great, yet he would not do it presently. He then shewed that Pious Conflict, which oft happens between GOD, and Elect <hi>Souls;</hi> when on the one Hand, <hi>GOD</hi> will not yet succour them in their <hi>Distresses;</hi> because 'tis not the time; and on the other, his Elect feeling such <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi>

                  <p>When 'twas night, he came to his <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> at the place where this <hi>Miracle</hi> was wrought; and to put the Remembrance of it out of their Minds, which were puft up at the thoughts thereof, He made them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a <hi>Ship,</hi> and pass the <hi>Sea,</hi> that the <hi>Tempest</hi> which soon after happened by his Order, might make them sensible of their Weakness in the absence of their <hi>Master;</hi> and that this Knowledge might keep them in <hi>Humility,</hi> which was to be (as it were) the Foundation, on which he would Erect this solid Vertue, which was to render them the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He left them for some time, in the midst of the <hi>Waves,</hi> being driven up and down the whole night by the Weather, without his hastning to deliver them. But when the day appeared, he drew towards them, Walking on the Surface of the <hi>Waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they beheld him, thus coming on the <hi>Floods,</hi> as on dry Land, they thought him to be a <hi>Spectrum,</hi> and their Fear made them send forth strong Cries.</p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Saviour</hi> spake to them to Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, saying, Fear not, It is I. S. <hi>Peter</hi> was the first that felt the Efficacy of this <hi>Divine Word;</hi> and having his Heart full of an Assurance, which placed him above all fear of danger, he said to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> if it be thou <hi>LORD,</hi> Command me to come upon the <hi>Waters</hi> to thee. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> bad him come; and S. <hi>Peter</hi> leapt immediately into the <hi>Sea,</hi> with a Confidence which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sufficiently enough admired, and which then denoted, That <hi>GOD</hi> would make his <hi>Church</hi> in future Ages Victorious through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the <hi>World;</hi> and that she should tread under Foot, whatsoever should oppose Her.</p>
                  <p>But as S. <hi>Peter</hi> thus went to joyn himself to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> a great Wind arose, which put him into an Astonishment; Fear over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed his <hi>Spirits,</hi> and his <hi>Faith</hi> failing, he began immediately to Sink.</p>
                  <p>Then did he Address himself to our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> who had already given him some power, entreating him to succour him. And <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> stretching out his hand, took hold of him, and blaming the Weakness of his <hi>Faith,</hi> bid him not be afraid. And when they were entred into the <hi>Ship,</hi> the Wind immediately ceased, and the <hi>Waves</hi> melted themselves into a Calm Smoothness.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> who have always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as full of <hi>Mysteries;</hi> have admired, he should suffer S. <hi>Peter</hi> to be in danger of drowning, after he had Commanding him to come on the <hi>Waters</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He designed, say these <hi>Ancient Writers,</hi> to convince this good <hi>Disciple,</hi> by his own Experience, That 'tis <hi>he only can Save,</hi> lest his natural assurance should Tempt him to <hi>Pride.</hi>

But our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> not listing to satisfie their Curious Humour, and concealing the manner of his Walking on the <hi>Waters:</hi> only told them, who were so Zealous in their search after him, That they followed him, meerly for the <hi>Loaves</hi> sake, and not out of any real Love to his <hi>Person,</hi> or <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Exhorted them, to Labour after other <hi>Food;</hi> and not to seek so greedily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Meat which perisheth.</p>
                  <p>He discoursed to them of the <hi>Eucharistical Bread,</hi> whereat many were Scandalized, even of his own <hi>Disciples.</hi> When they went away, <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> without shewing any Concern, at the seeing himself thus Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by his <hi>Disciples.</hi> Addrest himself to the Twelve <hi>Apostles,</hi> Demanding of them, whether they would also leave him? To which St. <hi>Peter</hi> answered with his usual Fervor; <hi>LORD, to whom shall we go, seeing thou hast the Words of Eternal Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> also plainly shewed, 'twas no wonder that several of his <hi>Disciples</hi> left him, seeing of the Twelve, which he had chosen particularly, there was one of them, which he assured them was a <hi>Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He left then <hi>Judea,</hi> to avoid the Rage of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> who began openly to declare themselves against him, and departed to the Coasts of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon;</hi> where he did more than he had done in <hi>Judea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For a <hi>Canaanitish Woman</hi> (arriving from those Parts, where our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> would not go himself, lest he should scandalize the <hi>Jews</hi>) came by a Secret Instinct of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who called her to him, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to her, who shewed him with great <hi>Cries,</hi> that her <hi>Daughter</hi> was tormented with a <hi>Devil,</hi> and entreated him to have Pity on her. But our <hi>Saviour</hi> although so Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate to others, yet seemed to give no Ear to the Complaints of this <hi>Woman,</hi> to the end he might give us in her <hi>Person</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent instance of the Prevalency of <hi>Prayer;</hi> and to shew us by her example, with what <hi>Humility</hi> we ought to persevere in it, when it seems to us that <hi>GOD Almighty</hi> in Deaf to our Requests, and rejects all our <hi>Petitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This humble <hi>Woman,</hi> being not able to obtain any thing of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> Addrest her self to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who interceded for her to our <hi>Saviour.</hi> But he answered, he was only sent to the lost <hi>Sheep</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and not to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And they being urgent with him, because the <hi>Canaanitish Woman</hi> Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned them, with her entreaties; our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> therefore to shew the Solidity of her <hi>Faith,</hi> would not yet yield to her. When at length she came up to him and cast herself at his <hi>Feet</hi> and Worshipped him, Imploring his Assistance, with great Lamentations. Our <hi>Lord</hi> still Repell'd her, and using her as a <hi>Dog,</hi> said to her, <hi>That it was not Lawful, to take the Childrens Bread, and cast it to Dogs.</hi> This usage which would have sufficiently provoked a Proud Spirit, served only to encrease her Confidence in our <hi>Saviour.</hi> She confest indeed she was but a <hi>Dog,</hi> yet that the <hi>Dogs were permitted to Eat of the Crums which fell from the Childrens Table,</hi> and that she desired no more.</p>
                  <p>She put herself into the Condition of such a mean Creature, and acknowledged the <hi>Jews</hi> to be her <hi>Masters,</hi> and the <hi>Children</hi> of the true <hi>GOD.</hi> This humble Confession in the midst of such a rude Treatment in Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, made our <hi>Saviour</hi> immediately Cry out, O <hi>Woman, great is thy Faith,</hi> and changing his Roughness into an Admiration of her <hi>Faith,</hi> immediately granted what she desired.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> have much extolled this <hi>Faith</hi> in a <hi>Pagan Woman;</hi> and S. <hi>Gregory the Great</hi> saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as this Idolatrous <hi>Woman</hi> confounded the Incredulity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> so it may often happen in the <hi>Church;</hi> That <hi>Persons</hi> who are engaged in <hi>Worldly</hi> Business, shall make those Blush, who make Profession of a more <hi>Heavenly Calling.</hi>

They answered, that some thought he was <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist;</hi> others that he was <hi>Elias;</hi> others, that he was <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> or one of the ancient <hi>Prophets.</hi> And you, said our <hi>Lord,</hi> whom think ye that I am? St. <hi>Peter</hi> then without Haesitating, answered; Thou art <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Living GOD.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> called him <hi>Blessed,</hi> because his <hi>Father</hi> had revealed to him this Truth, and assured him, he would so firmly establish his <hi>Holy Church,</hi> on this his Confession, That the Gates of <hi>Hell</hi> should never prevail against it.</p>
                  <p>This was a proper and ingenuous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Faith;</hi> yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not our blessed <hi>LORD,</hi> from calling him <hi>Satan,</hi> when he would have disswaded him from suffering and yielding unto Death: Which shews us, that <hi>GOD</hi> seldom raises up his <hi>Saints,</hi> but he immediately abases them; for Humane Weakness is so great, that if the Divine Goodness dealt not thus with us, we should be puft up, either with our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or spiritual Prosperity; which might prove of dreadful Consequence to us.</p>
                  <p>Eight Days after this had hapned, our <hi>Saviour</hi> took Three of his <hi>Disciples, viz.</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> (who ever seemed to be the chiefest Favorites, and to whom he shewed most Tenderness.) He led them up a high <hi>Mountain</hi> apart, and when he <hi>Prayed</hi> there, he was immediately <hi>Transfigured:</hi> His Countenance shined like the <hi>Sun,</hi> and his <hi>Garments</hi> were white as <hi>Snow:</hi> At the same time <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, who discoursed with <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> touching what was to happen to him at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Three <hi>Disciples</hi> that Slept, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately awaked; and were surprized at the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and at the Sight of the two <hi>Prophets</hi> who were talking with him. St. <hi>Peter</hi> being transported with <hi>Joy,</hi> thus spake to our <hi>Saviour, Master, it is good for us to be here: Let us make here three Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; one for thee, another for</hi> Moses, <hi>and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for</hi> Elias. But whilst he was yet speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a <hi>Cloud</hi> came and o'er shadowed them, and a <hi>Voice</hi> was heard, saying, <hi>This is my B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, hear ye Him.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Disciples</hi> fell immediately on the Ground with Astonishment; when <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near unto them, touched them, saying arise and be not afraid; they then arose, and saw no one save <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged them, as they were coming down from the <hi>Mountain,</hi> to tell no Body, what they had <hi>Seen</hi> and <hi>Heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Transfiguration</hi> full of <hi>Mysteries,</hi> was one of the Means which our <hi>Saviour</hi> made use of, to strengthen the <hi>Faith</hi> of his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi> and for a more sensible Perswasion to them that he was GOD, He intended by this Anticipation of his Glory, to shew them, what they should one Day be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the Dead; and that Maugre all the <hi>Labours, Tryals,</hi> and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> of this Life, they should certainly enjoy the Glory of which they had been <hi>Eye-witnesses</hi> on this <hi>Mountain.</hi> And 'tis this Sight which made them strong in their greatest Conflicts.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> came upon them, he made this <hi>Vision</hi> more useful to them, than it then appeared, comprehending by its <hi>Light,</hi> that this ineffable <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> which they had seen with their own <hi>Eyes,</hi> should be communicated to their own Body; so that we may say the Design of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> in this <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to render his <hi>Apostles</hi> strong in the Day of his <hi>Passion,</hi> and to remember his Glory in the time of his <hi>Humiliation;</hi> but even to make them strong themselves in the time of their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and to encourage them in their <hi>Afflictions,</hi> by the sight of the Glory with which they were to be attended.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now although our blessed <hi>Lord</hi> had given them Power over these <hi>Spirits,</hi> yet could not they drive out this; wherefore our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ</hi> having done it himself, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored this <hi>Son</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> his <hi>Disciples</hi> asked him privately, why they could not do it. He answered them, Because of their Unbelief; adding, That if they had <hi>Faith,</hi> they might remove the <hi>Mountains,</hi> and place them in the midst of the <hi>Sea.</hi> He afterwards informed them, that this kind of <hi>Devils,</hi> went not out but by <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus did he teach them their Mistake, in pretending to exercise an absolute Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the <hi>Devil,</hi> without using the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Means which <hi>GOD</hi> had prescribed, such as were <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>LORD</hi> after this went to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where those that gathered <hi>Taxes,</hi> ask'd St <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> whether his <hi>Master</hi> was for paying <hi>Tribute;</hi> and he answered he was: And they had no sooner entred into an <hi>House,</hi> but our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> prevented <hi>Peter</hi> with this Question; From whom do Princes require <hi>Tribute;</hi> from their <hi>Children</hi> or <hi>Strangers</hi>? But added he, that we may give no Offence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Go thou to the <hi>Sea,</hi> and open the Mouth of the first <hi>Fish</hi> thou shalt take; and therein thou shalt find a piece of <hi>Money,</hi> give it for me and thee.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> teaches us by this Example, to submit to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Place</hi> where we <hi>Live,</hi> and to obey <hi>Magistrates</hi> when the things they require of us be not sinful.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>LORD</hi> being seated in an <hi>House,</hi> with his <hi>Disciples,</hi> he demanded of them the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their <hi>Discourse</hi> in the way; for he knew they had been disputing, which of them should be the greatest. And intending to overthrow in their <hi>Minds</hi> all proud Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and Desires of <hi>Preheminency,</hi> he told them, that he that would be the first of all, should be the last: And to give them a more lively Image of this <hi>Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Soul,</hi> he took up a little <hi>Child,</hi> and placed him in the midst of them, saying, That if they endeavoured not to become like this <hi>Child,</hi> they could in no wise enter into the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, that the <hi>Disciples</hi> coming to him, asked him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was the greatest in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi>? And our <hi>Saviour</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him a little <hi>Child,</hi> and set him in the midst of them, and said, <hi>Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> Children, <hi>ye shall not enter into the</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>of</hi> Heaven, <hi>whosoever therefore shall humble himself, as this little</hi> Child <hi>the same is greatest in the</hi> Kingdom <hi>of</hi> Heaven, <hi>and who so shall receive one such little</hi> Child <hi>in my Name, receiveth me: But who so offends one of these little ones which believe in me, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him that a</hi> Mill-stone <hi>were hung about his Neck, and that he were drown'd in the Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> have much reflected on this Saying of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how difficult this is to the proud <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> their only Hope has been, in the Grace of him who uttered this Sentence.</p>
                  <p>Hence they have discoursed how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary it is to stifle all those ambitious Desires of appearing Greater than others; And that a true <hi>Christians</hi> Study ought to be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal himself; and to be willing, that others should be preferred before him. One <hi>Man</hi> is no greater than another; but only as he has more <hi>Charity,</hi> or more <hi>Humility;</hi> for all the rest is meer Vanity before <hi>GOD.</hi> And should a Man extol himself above other <hi>Men,</hi> because he has more <hi>Charity,</hi> this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would Rank him amongst the Lowest.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> stifles <hi>Pride,</hi> and plucks it up by the <hi>Roots,</hi> by reducing his <hi>Disciples</hi> to the Condition of a little <hi>Child.</hi> And if a <hi>Man</hi> would judge whether he shall be of the number of the <hi>Blessed</hi> in the other <hi>World,</hi> he need only to consider whether he be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as an <hi>Infant</hi> in this, and whether he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours by <hi>Christian Simplicity</hi> by <hi>Humility,</hi> by <hi>Obedience,</hi> and other <hi>Vertues,</hi> to be as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Children</hi> are in <hi>Body.</hi>

For no sooner had these <hi>Persons</hi> shewed themselves to the <hi>Priests,</hi> but they found themselves Cured of their <hi>Leprosy.</hi> One of the 10 immediately thereupon returned, loudly Glorifying <hi>GOD</hi> for so Miraculous a <hi>Cure;</hi> and went to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> throwing himself at his <hi>Feet,</hi> and Bowing his <hi>Head</hi> to the Ground, gave him thanks for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which he came from Receiving. Our <hi>LORD</hi> ask'd him whether they had not all been <hi>Cured</hi> and what were become of the other <hi>Nine</hi>?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gospel</hi> tells us only one of the Ten returned to our <hi>Saviour</hi> to give him thanks, and he was a <hi>Samaritan.</hi> Our <hi>Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> sent him away, telling him his <hi>Faith</hi> had saved him, sufficiently shewing how greatly the Ingratitude of the rest did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> considering this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have ever taken hence occasion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort <hi>Men</hi> to fly Ingratitude and to receive no favour from <hi>GOD,</hi> without shewing him, by all the signs they are able, how greatly they desire to make their acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments suitable to the Benefits they Receive.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not sufficient for us to rejoyce at the inward Cures of our <hi>Souls,</hi> seeing 'tis not to be Questioned, but that these 9 <hi>Lepers</hi> were thus Affected. They had beyond all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion a perfect sense of their <hi>Cure,</hi> and even admired from their <hi>Hearts,</hi> him that was the Author of it. But this was not enough. They ought to have returned and prostrated themselves, giving him Thanks in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming manner.</p>
                  <p>These ungrateful <hi>Persons</hi> have become by their Ingratitude, <hi>Leprous</hi> in their <hi>Souls,</hi> in cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be so in their <hi>Bodies;</hi> and have been in this particular like those, who forbearing sometimes to commit <hi>Gross Sins</hi> in the Sight of <hi>Men,</hi> increase by their Ingratitude their <hi>Secret Sins</hi> before <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Happy is he, says S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who always lies prostrate at our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Feet,</hi> giving him Thanks for the smallest <hi>Graces;</hi> and who considering himself as a Stranger in Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this <hi>Samaritan,</hi> believes that all the Favours done him, are the more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, in that he deserves only <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Punishment.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>OUR <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> having Healed these ten <hi>Lepers,</hi> as he past along, found, when he arrived in <hi>Judea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same year</hi> 32.</note> all <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in trouble, in that he was not come to the <hi>Feast,</hi> and all the <hi>People</hi> were divided in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they made of him; some saying he was a <hi>Good man,</hi> others maintaining he was a <hi>Seducer.</hi> But eight days after the <hi>Feast,</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> appeared in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and there Taught the <hi>People</hi> with such Wisdom, as Astonish'd all those as knew he had not been brought up in <hi>Human Sciences,</hi> and the Study of the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Speaking then publickly with great Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, those that heard him Admired, his <hi>Enemies</hi> that heard him, did not seize on him, Imagining sometimes they believed he was the <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But 'twas not long before <hi>Designs</hi> were laid against his <hi>Person,</hi> which yet proved Fruitless, because his Hour was not then come. For the <hi>Pharisees</hi> seeing the <hi>People</hi> speak of his <hi>Miracles</hi> with Admiration, loudly affirming, that when <hi>Christ</hi> came he could not do greater things: They could not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this Testimony which was given him, wherefore they sent <hi>Officers</hi> to seize on his <hi>Person:</hi> But whereas hitherto he had often hid himself, he did not so now; to give Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the different motions which <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Spirit</hi> should produce in those who should be Persecuted in following <hi>Ages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those then who came to take him, were with-held by a secret Stroak from <hi>GOD;</hi> so that instead of seizing him, they stood still and became his <hi>Auditors.</hi> And when the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who sent them, blamed them for not bringing him, they answered, <hi>That ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man spake as he did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> Retiring afterwards on the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Olives</hi> to <hi>Pray</hi> there, he came thence the next Morning very early into the <hi>Temple,</hi> where a great Croud surrounded him; But whilst he was <hi>Preaching,</hi> the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> laid a Snare for him, by presenting him with a <hi>Woman</hi> taken in <hi>Adultery,</hi> to the end, that if he Condemned her to <hi>Die,</hi> he might be decryed by the <hi>People</hi> as a <hi>Man</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream severe; and if he condemned her not he might be charged as a Breaker of <hi>Gods Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jesus</hi> knowing their <hi>Malice,</hi> Stoopt down, and wrote on the Ground; and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting to know his Opinion, he lifted up his <hi>Head,</hi> and said; <hi>He amongst you that is without Sin, cast the first Stone at her.</hi> Then began he again to write on the Ground, and in the mean time the <hi>Pharisees</hi> slunk one by one away, and the <hi>Woman</hi> was left alone, to whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> said, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no one had Condemned her, neither would he; and thereupon immediately sent her Home in <hi>Peace,</hi> charging her to <hi>Sin</hi> no more. Whereby our <hi>Lord</hi> shews us, he would rather have <hi>Men</hi> to condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves than accuse others, and to Examine their own Lives, rather than to Censure the Faults of their <hi>Brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Men</hi> generally abhor gross <hi>Sins</hi> because they make them uneasy; but make little regard of <hi>Spiritual Sins,</hi> which do more Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>GOD,</hi> who is all <hi>Spirit:</hi> The <hi>Sin</hi> of the <hi>Faln Angels,</hi> and that of the first <hi>Man</hi> have more Offended <hi>GOD,</hi> than the Crime of this <hi>Adulteress.</hi> And this is that which ought to humble us in the sight of <hi>GOD,</hi> and make us Gentle and Moderate to those who fall into these Dreadful Excesses: This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness being many times a Means to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from these Disorders. The mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness wherewith our <hi>Saviour</hi> treated this <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> had perhaps a greater effect upon her to disengage her from this Evil Course, than all the Severity of the <hi>Law. Nothing does more effect, and perswade a good Natured Person than Meekness and Gentleness, where they expected Rigor and Severity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church</hi> therefore in Imitation of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> discourages not the greatest <hi>Sinner,</hi> from hopes of <hi>Mercy,</hi> on the least signs of Contrition. She has thought sitting, that this sentence of our <hi>Saviour, Let him that is without Sin cast the first Stone,</hi> should have at least as great effect on the Hearts of <hi>Christians,</hi> as it had on the <hi>Jews;</hi> and that the <hi>Piety</hi> of such should yield to those <hi>Words</hi> to which the others hardness was obliged to yield.</p>

                        <hi>The same Year</hi> 32.</note> he continued to Preach to the <hi>People</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> several Important Truths, and reproach the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> with their design of destroying him. He shewed them from whence they were the <hi>Devils Ministers,</hi> who delighted in Blood from the beginning of the <hi>World,</hi> and had Slain the <hi>Prophets.</hi> He ask'd them openly which of them could Convince him of <hi>Sin;</hi> and why they did not believe him, seeing he Preached the Truth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> answered these just Reproaches, not with <hi>Reasons,</hi> but with <hi>Injuries,</hi> calling him a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and one possessed with a <hi>Devil.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> answered these <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies</hi> with great Meekness; But seeing them take up <hi>Stones</hi> to throw at him, he privately past out of the <hi>Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his passage thence, he saw a <hi>Man</hi> who was <hi>Born Blind.</hi> His <hi>Disciples</hi> asked him, whether this <hi>Man</hi> had <hi>Sinned,</hi> or his <hi>Parents,</hi> in that he was <hi>Born Blind?</hi> But our <hi>Saviour</hi> answered them and said, that neither this <hi>Man</hi> hath <hi>Sinned</hi> nor his <hi>Parents,</hi> but that the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> should be made manifest in him; and told them, <hi>That he must work the works of him that sent him, whilst it is day; for the night cometh when no Man can work; and as long as he was in the</hi> World, <hi>he was the Light of the</hi> World. When he had thus spoken, <hi>he spat on the Ground and made Clay with the Spittle, and anointed the</hi> Eyes <hi>of the Blind Man therewith, and bid him go wash in the</hi> Pool <hi>of</hi> Siloam, <hi>which he no sooner had done, but he received his</hi> Sight.</p>
                  <p>Those that knew him, were strangely surprized when they saw him. All who demanded of him in what manner so great a <hi>Miracle</hi> was wrought on him, were told, that a <hi>Man</hi> called <hi>Jesus</hi> had made <hi>Clay,</hi> and putting it on his <hi>Eyes,</hi> sent him to the <hi>Pool</hi> to wash them, which he had no sooner done but he recovered his <hi>Sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was hereupon carried to the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi> who asked him the same <hi>Questions,</hi> and had the same <hi>Answers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of them would needs have it That a <hi>Man</hi> who had made <hi>Clay</hi> on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Day</hi> could not be a good <hi>Man.</hi> Others who were Astonish'd at the greatness of the <hi>Miracle</hi> replyed, that an ill <hi>Man</hi> could not <hi>Cure</hi> one that was <hi>Born Blind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being thus divided one against another, they made the <hi>Blind Man</hi> speak again, and, demanded of him what he thought of this <hi>Man</hi>? To which he answered, That he was without doubt a <hi>Prophet.</hi> Angred with this reply, they would not believe he had been <hi>Blind.</hi> They therefore made his <hi>Parents</hi> come, who fearing such Passionate <hi>People,</hi> managed themselves with address, asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing else but that this was their <hi>Son,</hi> and that he was <hi>Born Blind;</hi> but as to the rest, they said, their <hi>Son</hi> was of Age to answer for himself.</p>
                  <p>Having again made this <hi>Blind Man</hi> come to them, they spake to him with greater Earnestness, bidding him give Glory to <hi>GOD,</hi> for they well knew our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> was a <hi>Sinner.</hi> I know not, answered he, whether he be a <hi>Sinner;</hi> but this I know, that having been <hi>Born Blind,</hi> I now see. The <hi>Jews</hi> said, That as for their parts, they were <hi>Moses Disciples,</hi> but they knew not what this <hi>Man</hi> was. This I cannot but wonder at, said he, that ye know not who he is, and yet he has opened mine <hi>Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pharisees</hi> after this put him out of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi> having found him ask'd him whether he Believed in the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi>? adding he was the Person who spake to him. The <hi>Man</hi> fell on the Ground and Worshipped him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An happy Blind Man,</hi> say the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who <hi>Discovered the true Light.</hi> He was not only the Worshipper of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> but his <hi>Defender.</hi> He confounded the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and shewed, that a Simple <hi>Faith</hi> which is Humble, is more Enlightned, than Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which puffeth up. The <hi>Jews</hi> drove him out of their <hi>Synagogue,</hi> but our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> received him into the Communion of the Faithful, and made his Heart his living <hi>Temple.</hi>

                  <p>AFter the Cure of the Man <hi>Born Blind,</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> relates what <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> said to the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the <hi>Charity</hi> which the <hi>Pastors</hi> ought to have for the Flock committed to them;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same Year</hi> 32.</note> in imitating that of the Sovereign <hi>Pastor</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> who laid down his Life freely for the safety of his <hi>Sheep.</hi> He gave in the few Words which he spake on this Subject, all desirable Marks to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one be of the number of the true <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> of the <hi>Divine Flock;</hi> seeing we need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know whether we be ready to part with, not only our <hi>Estates</hi> and our Ease, but our <hi>Lives</hi> also, in losing them immediately, or by a long sequel of <hi>Sufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He shewed how greatly opposite in this Point to the true <hi>Pastor,</hi> is he that is an <hi>Hireling,</hi> and flies away, when he espies the <hi>Wolf</hi> coming, that is, who keeps a Cowardly silence, when he should Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously oppose those who destroy the <hi>Flock</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But having instructed the <hi>Pastors</hi> in this Discourse, of the <hi>Charity</hi> which they owe their <hi>People;</hi> he afterwards instructs all Men, in that which they ought to have for one another. For a <hi>Doctor</hi> coming to demand of him, tempting him. which was the greatest <hi>Commandment</hi> of the <hi>Law?</hi> Our <hi>Lord</hi> answered him in one Word, That it was to love <hi>GOD with all ones Heart, and ones Neighbour as ones self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Doctor</hi> asked our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who are our Neighbours? and was informed by this <hi>Parable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A certain <hi>Man</hi> went down from <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to <hi>Jerico,</hi> and fell among <hi>Thieves,</hi> which stripped him of his <hi>Rayment, Wounded</hi> him, and departed, leaving him half Dead. And by chance there came down a certain <hi>Priest</hi> that way, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Levite</hi> did the same thing, both shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that great <hi>Vertues</hi> are not inherent to the highest Offices; and that one may have the Dignities of the <hi>Church,</hi> without having that <hi>Charity</hi> which should always accompany them.</p>
                  <p>In fine, a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> which is to say, a <hi>Pagan,</hi> and an <hi>Idolater,</hi> passing near this place in his Journey, saw this <hi>Man,</hi> and having Compassion on him, went to him, bound up his <hi>Wounds,</hi> pouring in <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and set him on his <hi>Beast,</hi> brought him to an <hi>Inn,</hi> and took care of him; and on the Morrow when he departed, he took out two <hi>Pence</hi> and gave it to the <hi>Inn-keeper,</hi> saying to him, take care of him, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> Demanded of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Doctor,</hi> who of these three <hi>Men</hi> had been his <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> who fell amongst <hi>Thieves?</hi> To which he answered, That 'twas he who had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on him. Go then, reply'd our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ,</hi> and do the same thing.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>LORD</hi> commands us in the Person of this <hi>Doctor</hi> to be always ready to succour those whom we see in <hi>Misery,</hi> and to spare neither our <hi>Cares,</hi> nor our <hi>Pains,</hi> nor our <hi>Estates,</hi> when an occasion of <hi>Charity</hi> offers it self. The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> complain, that <hi>Men</hi> are too cautious in these occasions.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Levite</hi> thought they had good reasons to pass on: They were also seemingly affected in seeing this <hi>Piteous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> but this <hi>Ineffectual Compassion</hi> hindred them not from being Cruel, in being wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to so pressing a Duty of <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Samaritan</hi> reasoned not much on the matter, he acted more <hi>Naturally</hi> and more <hi>Charitably</hi> than they; he thought the sight of this Pitious Object obliged him to use his utmost endeavours to assist him. Thus ought we to do; for how shall we be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to succour those miserable <hi>People,</hi> who are at a distance from us, if we do not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist such as lie languishing before our <hi>Eyes?</hi>

whom he sent two by two before him, wheresoever he was to go; and who living <hi>Content</hi> in their Condition, without envying the <hi>Apostles</hi> who were above them, they then gave us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that those who should be one day in the inferiour Degrees in the <hi>Church,</hi> should live therein satisfied, without Grudging at those who are in higher Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where they must not think to ascend by their <hi>Pride,</hi> but remain with an humble resignedness in their Condition, unless <hi>GOD</hi> draw them thence, as he drew out <hi>Matthias</hi> from the seventy and two <hi>Disciples,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote him to the <hi>Apostle-ship.</hi> Having sent them with Power to cast forth <hi>Devils</hi> they returned transported with Joy, telling our <hi>LORD,</hi> that these <hi>Unclean Spirits</hi> were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them by Vertue of his Name. But our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> inspiring them with the Contempt of these lower <hi>Gifts,</hi> tells them, they ought not to rejoice at this <hi>Empire,</hi> which they had over the <hi>Unclean Spirits,</hi> but in that their Names were written in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And thereupon immediately by a Motion of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> he gave thanks to his <hi>Father,</hi> in that he had hid these things from the <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Prudent,</hi> and revealed them to <hi>Babes.</hi> And turning himself at the same time to his <hi>Disciples</hi> he said unto them, Blessed are the <hi>Eyes</hi> which see those things which they saw; for many <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> had desired that Sight but could not obtain it; whereby he shewed to those that had received from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the same <hi>Mysteries</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how great their Crime would be, in losing them; or not esteeming them as they ought for want of applying themselves to the serious and continual Consideration of them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Jesu Christ</hi> designing to give us an Instance, how <hi>Christians</hi> should spend their time, went into a <hi>Castle,</hi> where a Woman named <hi>Martha,</hi> received him, which Woman had a Sister named <hi>Mary;</hi> who lying at our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Feet</hi> heard <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> his Holy <hi>Word,</hi> whilst <hi>Martha</hi> was busied in making Preparations for his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment: She was also dissatisfied that her <hi>Sister</hi> did not help her, in the Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty she found her self in, and therefore she makes known her Complaint to our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> who was so far from sending away <hi>Mary,</hi> from this her important Attention, that he took her part against her <hi>Sister,</hi> and told <hi>Martha,</hi> that whilst she was employed with so great Earnestness about several Matters, <hi>Mary</hi> had chosen the better part, and which should never be taken from her.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fathers</hi> have hence gathered, That though the external Actions of <hi>Charity,</hi> be necessary during this Life, yet those whom <hi>GOD</hi> gives Dispensations from them, for to keep them in a calm State of Life, wholly employed in the Meditation of his <hi>Word,</hi> are always in the most happy Condition.</p>
                  <p>Nothing appears more beseeming, than to prepare fit <hi>Entertainments</hi> for our <hi>LORD</hi> himself; and yet <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> prefers the Repose of <hi>Mary</hi> before the Employments of <hi>Martha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Saying of our <hi>Saviour, That there is but one thing necessary,</hi> has had a great Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the Conduct of the <hi>Saints.</hi> They have seen, that all things else are compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively Superfluous, and that 'tis difficult to apply ones self to them, without Prejudice <hi>to this one thing.</hi> Wherefore they have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this Sentence should moderate the Activity of those, who place all their <hi>Piety</hi> in external <hi>Actions;</hi> and tho' these Works of <hi>Charity</hi> be excellent in themselves; yet they should fear, lest the <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> wherewith they be circumstanced, do not insensibly lessen the inward <hi>Purity,</hi> and Union of <hi>Heart</hi> with <hi>GOD;</hi> in which doth properly consist this one thing necessary, which our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all things.</p>

                  <p>That if these External Engagements are always to be dreaded by all sorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; Our <hi>Saviour</hi> shews how much more they are to be so, by those he has chosen to be his <hi>Ministers.</hi> For two <hi>Brethren</hi> having entreated him to accord them, and to divide to each his <hi>Portion,</hi> he said to them with a kind of Indignation, Who made me a <hi>Judge,</hi> or <hi>Divider</hi> over you? Shewing by this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that he would not concern himself in the <hi>Affairs</hi> of this <hi>World;</hi> and that a True <hi>Christian,</hi> and especially a Minister of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> should avoid these secular Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not deceive themselves by a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Charity,</hi> with which they are covered.</p>
                  <p>He took occasion from the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two <hi>Brethren</hi> touching the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of their <hi>Estate,</hi> to warn <hi>Men</hi> to avoid Covetousness, and to assure them, that <hi>Man</hi>'s Life consists not in the Abundance of these things which he possesseth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he told them this <hi>Parable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ground</hi> of a certain <hi>Rich Man</hi> brought forth Plentifully; and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, having no Room to bestow my <hi>Fruits</hi>? I will pull down my <hi>Barns</hi> and build greater, and there will I bestow all my <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Goods,</hi> and will say to my <hi>Soul, Soul</hi> thou hast much <hi>Goods</hi> laid up for many <hi>Years,</hi> take thine <hi>Ease, Eat, Drink,</hi> and be <hi>Merry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>GOD</hi> said unto him, thou <hi>Fool,</hi> this Night shall thy <hi>Soul</hi> be required of thee; Then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up Treasure for himself, and is not <hi>Rich</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>GOD.</hi> And our <hi>Saviour</hi> said to his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> take no thought for your <hi>Life,</hi> what ye shall <hi>Eat;</hi> neither for your <hi>Body,</hi> what ye shall put on; the <hi>Life</hi> is more than <hi>Meat,</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> more than <hi>Rayment;</hi> consider the <hi>Ravens,</hi> for they neither <hi>Sow</hi> nor <hi>Reap,</hi> nor have <hi>Store House</hi> or <hi>Barn,</hi> and <hi>GOD</hi> feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them; how much more are ye better than the <hi>Fowls</hi>?

                  <p>The <hi>Rich Man</hi> whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls <hi>Fool,</hi> intended not to enrich himself by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means; his <hi>Folly</hi> consisted in making such <hi>Provision</hi> for many <hi>Years,</hi> when he was presently surprized by <hi>Death.</hi> So that our <hi>Lord</hi> would have us stifle in our selves, all immoderate Desires after things below, by the continual foresight of the Moment, wherein we must leave all these things.</p>

                     <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> who knew the Importance of it, here learns us to have this Consideration perpetually in our <hi>Minds;</hi> and 'tis one of the chief Effects of <hi>Christian Humility,</hi> to nourish our <hi>Souls</hi> with the <hi>Meditation</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> and to say with <hi>David, Lord make me to know my End, and the number of my Days.</hi>

                  <p>But the most cogent Instance which our <hi>Saviour</hi> has given us on this Subject, is that of the <hi>Prodigal Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A certain <hi>Man,</hi> says he, had two <hi>Sons,</hi> the younger of them desired his <hi>Father</hi> to give him his <hi>Portion</hi> of goods that was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to him, and the <hi>Father</hi> divided his liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them; and not many days after the younger gathered all together, and took his Journey into a far Country, and there wasted his <hi>Estate</hi> with <hi>Harlots,</hi> and in other <hi>Debaucheries.</hi> And having spent all, a great Famine arose in the Land, so that he began to be in want: Whereupon he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to Pin himself upon one of the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of that <hi>Country,</hi> who sent him into the <hi>Field</hi> to feed <hi>Swine:</hi> And his <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> was so great, that although he earnestly desired to Eat what the <hi>Hogs</hi> did Eat, yet no body would give that unto him.</p>
                  <p>And when he came to himself, he sighed at the Remembrance of his <hi>Fathers</hi> hired <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> to think that they had <hi>Bread</hi> enough, and to spare, whilst he was ready to perish with <hi>Hunger.</hi> I will therefore arise, leave this Wretched Condition, and go to my <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Father</hi> perceived him, when he was a great way off; and being moved to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, he ran to meet him, and Embraced him; being not ashamed to acknowledge him for his <hi>Son;</hi> Suppressing, by the Joy, which he had in possessing him, the Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the injury he had done him in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating himself from him.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Young Man</hi> being then more than ever, effectually sensible of the Offence which he had committed, in forsaking so good a <hi>Father,</hi> said to him, with the deepest Sorrow,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Father, I have Sinned against Heaven and against thee, and am therefore no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this good <hi>Father,</hi> willing to Re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish him in his former Condition of a <hi>Son,</hi> of which he acknowledged himself so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, commanded his <hi>Servants</hi> to bring forth the <hi>Best Robe,</hi> and to put it on him, and to put a <hi>Ring</hi> on his <hi>Hand,</hi> and <hi>Shooes</hi> on his <hi>Feet,</hi> and to bring forth the Fatted <hi>Calf,</hi> and kill it, that they might Eat and be Merry; For this my <hi>Son,</hi> says he, was <hi>Dead,</hi> and is <hi>Alive,</hi> he was lost, and is found; and they began to Rejoice.</p>
                  <p>Now his <hi>Elder Son</hi> was in the <hi>Field,</hi> and as he drew nigh to the <hi>House,</hi> he heard <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> and <hi>Dancing.</hi> And he called one of the <hi>Servants,</hi> asking him what was the meaning of this <hi>Mirth;</hi> who told him, that his <hi>Brother</hi> was come, and his <hi>Fathrr</hi> had killed the <hi>Fatted Calf</hi> for Joy. Whereupon he was <hi>Angry,</hi> and would not go in, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Father</hi> came out and entreated him, saying, that although all he had was his, yet he might Rejoice at the recovery of his other <hi>Son</hi> from the <hi>Grave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis a difficult matter, say the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to add any thing to this <hi>Parable</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeing it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it self in such a full and lively manner.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eye</hi> sees therein, and the <hi>Heart</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in feels what is above all <hi>Words.</hi> The <hi>Marks</hi> of a true Conversion are here admirably well exprest. This <hi>Son</hi> sees his Misery, and leaves it, he returns to his <hi>Father,</hi> and gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to him. Let us also forsake <hi>Sin,</hi> and turn we to <hi>GOD</hi> from the Bottom of our <hi>Souls,</hi> and he will have Bowels of Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for us; Let us be sorrowful like this young <hi>Man,</hi> for having forsook our <hi>Father's House;</hi> and let us esteem our selves happy for having again been received into it.

                  <p>The <hi>Rich Man</hi> also died, but his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition after Death, was as different from that of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as it had been during his Life: For he was Condemned to the Torments of <hi>Hell,</hi> where lifting up his <hi>Eyes,</hi> he saw <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> afar off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his <hi>Bosom;</hi> and he cryed, in the Anguish which posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his <hi>Soul,</hi> unto <hi>Father Abraham</hi> to have pity on him, and to send <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he might dip the <hi>Tip</hi> of his <hi>Finger</hi> in <hi>Water,</hi> and Cool his <hi>Tongue,</hi> being horribly scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with those <hi>Flames.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Abraham</hi> bid him remember, that he had in his Life-time received his good things, whilst <hi>Lazarus</hi> lived in <hi>Want</hi> and <hi>Misery;</hi> but that now <hi>Lazarus</hi> enjoyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible Happiness, whilst he was enduring the saddest Torments. And besides, said he, between us and you, there is a great <hi>Gulph</hi> fixed, so that they which would pass from hence to you, cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</p>
                  <p>Then said he, I pray thee at least <hi>Father Abraham,</hi> that thou wouldst send him to my <hi>Father's House;</hi> for I have Five <hi>Brethren,</hi> who if they were certainly informed of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of this place, would undoubtedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Lives, to prevent their falling into such a state of Misery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> answered him, That they had <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> whom if they did not hear, neither would they be perswaded, should one arise from the Dead to convince them.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Parable</hi> has two different Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Whatever concerns <hi>Lazarus</hi> is sweet and pleasant; and whatever relates to <hi>Dives,</hi> that is, the <hi>Rich Man,</hi> is dreadful and astonishing.</p>
                  <p>The one was really happy in appearing miserable; and if he desired Consolations, 'twas only <hi>Crumbs,</hi> the better to bear his after-<hi>Miseries,</hi> not to end them. The other on the contrary was truly miserable, when he appeared happy; and he found <hi>Lazarus</hi> as constant after his Death, in refusing him the least Consolations, as he had been Hard-hearted himself in his Life-time, in refusing <hi>Lazarus</hi> the <hi>Crumbs</hi> which fell from his <hi>Table.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Example which <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself proposes, The <hi>Faithful Poor</hi> do not at all envy the <hi>Rich:</hi> But on the contrary, they have a secret Compassion for them; and so far are they from murmuring against the <hi>Rich,</hi> and desiring their <hi>Riches,</hi> that they bless GOD for their <hi>Poverty,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it as an excellent means to Humble them before <hi>GOD,</hi> for their <hi>Sins,</hi> which they have always before their <hi>Eyes,</hi> and which they feel as <hi>Lazarus</hi> felt his <hi>Sores.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poverty</hi> suffered in this <hi>World</hi> in this manner, is a Spring of Happiness in the <hi>World</hi> to come; and the <hi>Rich</hi> are very unhappy, if they place not their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Succouring these kind of <hi>Poor,</hi> seeing that according to the Words of St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> the <hi>Poors Friends, are the Friends of Kings; and the Voluntary Poor, are Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For he compares the Time in which he shall come, to that in which the <hi>Deluge</hi> drown'd the <hi>World; Men</hi> then, says he, <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Drank;</hi> they <hi>Married</hi> their <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters,</hi> till the Day that the Flood hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which Buried them all.</p>
                  <p>To avoid a Surprize of this dismal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, our <hi>Saviour</hi> advises the Faithful to <hi>Pray without ceasing,</hi> and to do it with the same Earnestness and Constancy as a <hi>Widow,</hi> which is oppressed, entreats a <hi>Judge</hi> to do her <hi>Justice,</hi> and who importunes him in such a sort, by the assiduity of her Cries, that he is forced against his own Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to yield to her Requests, and do what she would have him.</p>
                  <p>But in exhorting us to frequent and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <hi>Prayer,</hi> and in giving us so excellent an Instance in this <hi>Widow</hi> he speaks of, he gives us in the same <hi>Parable,</hi> a double Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of two <hi>Persons</hi> that <hi>Pray,</hi> one of which he greatly dislikes, but the other's manner is very pleasing to them.</p>
                  <p>Two <hi>Men,</hi> says he, went to the <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>Pray:</hi> The one was a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> that is to say, of the Number of those, who made profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a greater <hi>Vertue;</hi> and the other was a <hi>Publican,</hi> that is, one of those who were counted the loosest sort of <hi>People</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well for their <hi>Rapines</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,</hi> as other sort of Irregularities.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pharisee</hi> standing upright, gave <hi>Thanks</hi> to <hi>GOD,</hi> that he was not like the rest of <hi>Men,</hi> who live disorderly, without any certain <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Life;</hi> or else like meer <hi>Formalists,</hi> void of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Godliness;</hi> nor as this scandalous <hi>Publican,</hi> who he then beheld in the <hi>Temple.</hi> He told <hi>God Almighty</hi> he fasted twice in the <hi>Week,</hi> and gave exactly the tenth part of his <hi>Goods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whilst he offered to <hi>GOD</hi> these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous <hi>Boastings,</hi> and laid before him his best <hi>Works;</hi> The <hi>Publican</hi> in a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Temper of <hi>Mind,</hi> stood at the lower end of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and blushing at the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of his Nature, and actual Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, shewed outwardly the Confusion he felt within. He dared not to lift up his <hi>Eyes</hi> to <hi>Heaven;</hi> he smote his <hi>Breast,</hi> and opened his <hi>Mouth</hi> only to say these <hi>Words, GOD be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi> This <hi>Publican</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> saith went down to his <hi>House</hi> justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, rather than the other; for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>
                  <p>Our blessed <hi>Lord,</hi> shews us in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this <hi>Parable,</hi> how greatly different his Thoughts are from ours; and how greatly his <hi>Judgments</hi> are above those of <hi>Men.</hi> For <hi>Men</hi> would have been apt to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded this <hi>Pharisee</hi> with Admiration; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>GOD</hi> only looks upon him with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Dislike: And whereas this <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> was despised by all the <hi>World,</hi> our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> assures us, that his <hi>Humility</hi> rendred him honourable, and acceptable in the Sight of <hi>GOD;</hi> For <hi>GOD resisteth the Proud, but gives Grace to the Humble;</hi> and that he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a <hi>Proud Man,</hi> that prefers himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, on the Account of any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Qualifications that they want.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes, that this <hi>Pharisee</hi>'s Crime was, not that he attributed the good <hi>Qualities</hi> he was endowed with, to himself, as purely his own, Independent from <hi>GOD;</hi> seeing he thanked him for them; but in that he extolled himself above those, who seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be so highly favoured of <hi>Heaven</hi> by the Participation of these Gifts.</p>
                  <p>External <hi>Vertues</hi> are dangerous, if they be not at the same time accompanied with great <hi>Humility;</hi> and 'tis better to be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble only of Faults in ones self, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold like this <hi>Pharisee,</hi> a great number of good <hi>Works,</hi> which too often serve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire us with Complacency in our selves, and Contempt of others.</p>

                        <hi>The same Year</hi> 32.</note>
spake to them this <hi>Parable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Heaven</hi> is like unto a <hi>Man</hi> that is an <hi>House-holder,</hi> which went out early in the <hi>Morning,</hi> to hire <hi>Laborers</hi> into his <hi>Vineyard:</hi> And having agreed with the <hi>Laborers</hi> for a <hi>Penny</hi> a <hi>Day,</hi> he sent them into his <hi>Vineyard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he went out about the third <hi>Hour,</hi> and saw others standing idle in the <hi>Market-Place,</hi> to whom he said, Go ye also into the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and whatsoever is right I will give you, and they went their way.</p>
                  <p>Again he went out about the sixth and ninth <hi>Hour,</hi> and did the like; and about the eleventh <hi>Hour,</hi> he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the <hi>Day</hi> idle? They said unto him, because no <hi>Man</hi> has hired us; He saith unto them, go ye also into the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and whatsover is right, that shall ye receive.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Evening</hi> was come, the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard</hi> saith unto his <hi>Steward;</hi> Call the <hi>Laborers</hi> and give them their <hi>Hire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the last unto the first</p>
                  <p>And when they came that were hired about the eleventh <hi>Hour,</hi> they received every <hi>Man</hi> a <hi>Penny:</hi> But when those that were hired first came, they supposed that they should have received more; but they received the same <hi>Wages;</hi> which made them <hi>Murmur</hi> against the <hi>Good Man</hi> of the <hi>House,</hi> saying; These last have wrought but one <hi>Hour,</hi> and thou hast made them equal to us, which have bore the <hi>Burden</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Day.</hi> But he answered one of them and said, <hi>Friend</hi> I do thee no wrong; didst thou not agree with me for a <hi>Penny</hi>? Take that which is thine, and go thy Way. I will give unto this last, even as unto thee; Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own; or are you Wicked, because I am Good?</p>
                  <p>Thus says our <hi>Saviour, The last shall be first, and the first shall be last; for many be called; but few chosen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Encouragement and Comfort does this <hi>Parable</hi> yield to such, the greatest part of whose <hi>Lives</hi> has been consumed in Folly and Wickedness, if they do but at length heartily bewail their ill-spent Time, and seriously betake themselves to the working out of their <hi>Salvation</hi>? Who can sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough admire and extol the <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of the <hi>Lord?</hi> Who can shew forth all his <hi>Praises,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks; for he does not deal with us after our <hi>Sins,</hi> nor reward us according to our <hi>Iniquities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> have taken occasion also from this <hi>Parable,</hi> to exhort <hi>Christians</hi> to fly Idleness, which <hi>GOD</hi> hereby shews to be disagreeable in his Sight. All <hi>Work</hi> in this <hi>Vineyard,</hi> though the <hi>Work</hi> be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; 'tis sufficient to do therein what the <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Family</hi> commands us, contenting our selves both with the <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Wages,</hi> which he thinks fitting to allot us. We should also take care not to be puft up, or <hi>Pride</hi> our selves on the Account of the Excellency of our <hi>Work,</hi> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect thereof greater Recompence for it. We lose our Labour when we apply our selves too strictly to it; and consume our Strength in Vain, when we build our hopes thereon. It is from <hi>GOD</hi> alone, and his Bounty, from whom we are to expect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may receive. Whatever Goodness we do, 'tis not properly we that do it, but <hi>GOD,</hi> for 'tis he that worketh in us both, to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>do</hi> of his good Pleasure; And <hi>GOD</hi> in rewarding us, will only Crown his own Gifts in us. Unhappy, saith S. <hi>Austin,</hi> would the best of <hi>Men</hi> be, should <hi>GOD</hi> leave them to themselves, and examin the best of <hi>Mens</hi> Works, according to the strict Rules of his <hi>Purity.</hi>

                  <p>THE appointed time of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Death</hi> drawing near, it seems as if he in some sort advanced it, by the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus.</hi>

And this being one of his most Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Miracles,</hi> it stirred up a greater envy in the Minds of his <hi>Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was sick in <hi>Bethany,</hi> his Sisters <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> sent to our <hi>Saviour</hi> to give him notice of it. Our <hi>Lord</hi> who loved these two <hi>Sisters</hi> and their Brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> contented himself with saying then that this <hi>Sickness</hi> happned only for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory of <hi>GOD.</hi> And that the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> might be glorified thereby. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so far was he, from hasting to <hi>Cure</hi> him, that he remained 2 days on purpose in the same place, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might <hi>Die;</hi> and to shew us at the same time, that his absence from us, is the cause of the <hi>Spiritual Death</hi> of our <hi>Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After these two days, he told his <hi>Disciples</hi> that he must go again into <hi>Judea:</hi> But they fearing the danger of that <hi>Journey,</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred him, that 'twas but a Moment since his <hi>Enemies,</hi> the <hi>Jews sought to Stone</hi> him, and take away his <hi>Life.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> said unto them, are there not 12 Hours in the day, in which if one walk, he stumbleth not as seeing the light of this <hi>World;</hi> but if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. Then he said unto them. that <hi>Lazarus</hi> sleepeth, but I go to awaken him; his <hi>Disciples</hi> answered, if he Sleep he shall do well; then our <hi>Saviour</hi> told them plainly that he was <hi>Dead,</hi> and was glad for their sakes that he was not there at his <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was on this occasion that S. <hi>Thomas</hi> said those <hi>Words,</hi> which have been as it were the device of all <hi>Christians</hi> in all Ages, when they have seen <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> persecuted in his Members; <hi>Let us go and die with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was in <hi>Bethany,</hi> he found <hi>Lazarus</hi> Dead four days, and laid in the <hi>Grave. Martha</hi> understanding that our <hi>Lord</hi> was coming, made hast to meet him; and left <hi>Mary</hi> her <hi>Sister</hi> with those of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who came from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to comfort her. <hi>Martha</hi> shewed her Grief to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> in that he was not present at her <hi>Brother</hi>'s <hi>Sickness;</hi> and she shewed also her <hi>Faith,</hi> by saying, she was certain, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the condition her <hi>Brother</hi> was in, our <hi>Saviour</hi> could obtain of <hi>GOD,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he desired of him; and confessed that he was <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of the Living <hi>GOD,</hi> who came into the <hi>World.</hi> She went also to <hi>Mary,</hi> and told her privately, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> was come, and asked for her. <hi>Mary</hi> arose at these <hi>Words,</hi> and ran to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> which were with her to comfort her followed her, supposing the Violence of her Grief transported her to the Place, where her <hi>Brother</hi> lay <hi>Buried.</hi>
                  </p>

Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> commanded them to unbind him, and let him go.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> have all of them respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Lazarus</hi> as a <hi>Type,</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and the Conversion of a <hi>Sinner.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> draws near to the <hi>Soul,</hi> as he drew near to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and calls it with a loud <hi>Voice,</hi> to raise it by the power of his Word, by the power of <hi>Binding</hi> and <hi>loosing,</hi> which he has given his <hi>Church,</hi> and by the impressions of his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which form in <hi>Mens Hearts</hi> a sincere Regret, and makes them bring forth <hi>Fruits</hi> worthy of <hi>Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Tears,</hi> this <hi>Trouble,</hi> this <hi>Groaning,</hi> and this <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> do shew, how painful a thing it is to raise up those <hi>Dead</hi> who have grown old in sinful Habits. But what difficulty soever there is in this <hi>Work,</hi> we ought not to despair of any <hi>Man,</hi> when we consider the Powerfulness of this <hi>Voice,</hi> which makes the <hi>Dead</hi> Rise out of their <hi>Graves,</hi> and the <hi>Bounty</hi> of him, who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after makes him <hi>Eat</hi> at his <hi>Table</hi> who lay before in the Rottenness of a <hi>Sepulcher.</hi>

                  <head>The Conversion of Zacheus.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Pharisees</hi> being informed of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and seeing with sorrow, the Fame which this <hi>Miracle</hi> had procured our <hi>Saviour;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same Year</hi> 32.</note> they thereupon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately assembled together, to deliberate amongst themselves, what they had to do. If we let this <hi>Man</hi> go on, say they, in this manner, all the <hi>People</hi> will believe in him; and the <hi>Romans</hi> will come, and seize upon our <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Estates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One amongst them, who was <hi>High Priest</hi> that year, being inspired of <hi>GOD,</hi> Prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That 'twas expedient one <hi>Man</hi> should die for the <hi>People;</hi> and from that time they resolved on his Death. Which <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> knowing he privately retired, and would no longer remain in <hi>Judea.</hi> But a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the time of his Death approaching, he resolved to return to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and foretold as he was Travelling thither, what was to befal him.</p>
                  <p>When they drew near to <hi>Jerico,</hi> a certain <hi>Publican</hi> named <hi>Zachaeus,</hi> hearing of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> coming, had a great desire of a long time to see him, and therefore thrust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self amongst the Croud of those that went before him; but being a <hi>Man</hi> of low Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he was hindred, by those that attended our <hi>Saviour,</hi> whereupon he was forced to run before, and to get upon a <hi>Sycamore-Tree</hi> which stood in the way side, near to which our blessed <hi>Lord</hi> was to pass by.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour being come to the place where he stood, and lifting up his <hi>Eyes,</hi> bid <hi>Zachaeus</hi> to come down, for he would abide that day at his <hi>House.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zachaeus</hi> giving an Example of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness we ought to use in obeying <hi>GOD's Commands,</hi> immediately came down, and Entertained the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> at his Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with great Joy, although all the <hi>People</hi> murmured at our <hi>Saviour's</hi> chusing this <hi>Mans House</hi> for the place of his Retirement, when the Master of it, was of so Odious a Profession. But <hi>Zachaeus</hi> being fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from the Bottom of his <hi>Soul;</hi> and Renouncing from that very Moment his past <hi>Life,</hi> came and presented himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> saying, with an humble <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Gracious liberty,</hi> that he would now distribute half of his <hi>Goods</hi> to the <hi>Poor,</hi> and with the rest make <hi>Restitutions;</hi> and that if he wronged any body, he would restore them Four-fold.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> having heard this <hi>Holy Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> which he himself had put into his <hi>Heart,</hi> said; that this day <hi>Salvation</hi> was come to his <hi>House;</hi> and that this Man, whom the <hi>Jews</hi> could not but regard with Horror, was of the number of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> considered <hi>Zachaeus</hi> as an instance of a true <hi>Conversion.</hi> He seems to be beforehand with our <hi>Saviour;</hi> But our <hi>Saviour</hi> had indeed been first dealing with him, by the Invisible Motions of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> whence followed all those Visible <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> which he had received.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zachaeus</hi> was so full of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that he would willingly have part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all his <hi>Goods</hi> to the <hi>Poor;</hi> but only he considered, that necessity of reserving a part to make Restitution, to such as he might have wronged. For he knew that <hi>GOD</hi> did not approve of a <hi>Mans</hi> being Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, with what is not his own.</p>
                  <p>He thought it not enough, to Restore what he had taken away, but he would make a Four-fold return: And therefore <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> immediately declares the happiness of his Condition. For when the Darling and beloved <hi>Sin</hi> is parted with, as <hi>Covetousness</hi> and <hi>Griping</hi> in these sort of <hi>People,</hi> all the rest do fall of course.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gospel</hi> shews us, by this remarkable instance, that we must always begin our Conversion, by removing the greatest Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, such as are <hi>Restitution</hi> of <hi>Goods,</hi> or good <hi>Name.</hi> For GOD sooner pardons those Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which are committed against himself, than those committed against our <hi>Neighbours.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>People</hi> knowing that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was in this place, came crouding, not only to see him, but also <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that was raised from the Dead: which further discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> they determined to put him likewise to Death; whose <hi>Resurrection</hi> encreasing the Fame of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> hindred the design they had formed of destroying him, and induced several among the <hi>Jews</hi> to believe in him.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the <hi>City,</hi> sent his <hi>Disciples</hi> from the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Olives,</hi> where he was, to a Neighbouring <hi>Village</hi> and commanded them to loose an <hi>Ass</hi> with its <hi>Foal,</hi> and bring them both away; and to answer those that might offer to hinder them, that the <hi>Lord</hi> had need of them. The <hi>Disciples</hi> did as our <hi>Saviour</hi> had commanded them, and spread their <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> on this <hi>Ass,</hi> and set <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> thereon, as it is written, <hi>fear not Daughter of</hi> Sion, <hi>behold thy King cometh sitting on an Ass's Colt.</hi> When immediately, all the <hi>People</hi> who were come to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> on account of the <hi>Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> hearing that our <hi>Saviour</hi> was about entring into the <hi>City,</hi> they took Branches of <hi>Palms</hi> in their <hi>Hands,</hi> and went before him, with loud Acclamations of <hi>Joy:</hi> Several threw their <hi>Garments</hi> on the Ground, in the places where our <hi>Saviour</hi> was to pass along; and others strewed the Road with <hi>Boughs</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> and cried before him; <hi>Salvation and Glory to the Son of</hi> David; <hi>Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Applauses</hi> and <hi>Acclamation</hi> of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> more and more enraged the Enemies of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which made them say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, what shall we do, for all the <hi>People</hi> croud after him?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> have made excellent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations on this <hi>Miracle</hi> of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> He <hi>Triumphs,</hi> say they before-hand, as he died before-hand in the last <hi>Supper.</hi> He shews the real Power he was to gain on Mens <hi>Hearts,</hi> by the Merits of his Death, and by the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of his <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He does what he will with these <hi>People;</hi> he forces the Wicked to adore him, even as they shall one day, be constrained with the <hi>Devils,</hi> to bow their <hi>Knees</hi> before him, and confess that he is <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> hate him; they would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed him, yet they cannot hinder his <hi>Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hence appears, that 'tis <hi>GOD</hi> alone, that governs all things on <hi>Earth,</hi> as well as in <hi>Heaven;</hi> That the Wicked as well as the Good, are subject to his Power; and that we do in vain think to rule the Events of this <hi>World.</hi> We ought always to say, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happens, That <hi>GOD</hi> has thus ordained it, and after this, to <hi>lie down</hi> in <hi>Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the sole advantage of <hi>Christians,</hi> and the best course they can take in all their affairs; seeing this Temper of Mind raises them above the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> above <hi>Men, Angels</hi> and <hi>Devils,</hi> nay, <hi>Heaven</hi> it self; to make them enter into the Sanctuary of <hi>GOD,</hi> and to remain firm and unmoveable, whilst they are on <hi>Earth,</hi> amidst all the <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Tempests</hi> of it.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> saith our <hi>Saviour,</hi> is like unto a <hi>King,</hi> who made a <hi>Marriage</hi> for his <hi>Son,</hi> and sent his <hi>Servants</hi> to call those which were bidden to the <hi>Wedding.</hi> But these <hi>Persons</hi> made light of this Invitation, and came not: He sent to them again o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Servants,</hi> to tell them, he had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his <hi>Oxen,</hi> and <hi>Fatlings,</hi> and that all things were in a Readiness: But they still forbore coming, for some went to their <hi>Farms,</hi> and others to their <hi>Merchandizes;</hi> and there were others more ungrateful and base, who outragiously handled the <hi>King's Servants,</hi> and slew them. And when the <hi>King</hi> heard of this, he was wroth, and sent forth his <hi>Armies,</hi> and slew these <hi>Murtherers,</hi> and burnt their <hi>City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which being done, he said to his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> You see, I have gotten all things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but those I had invited are not worthy of the Entertainment; Go then into the <hi>Highways,</hi> and as many as ye shall find there, bring to the <hi>Wedding.</hi> The <hi>Servants</hi> obeyed their <hi>Master,</hi> and gathered together a great number of <hi>Persons,</hi> both good and bad, so that the <hi>Table</hi> was filled with <hi>Guests.</hi>

                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> tell us, That this <hi>Nuptial Robe,</hi> is the <hi>New Man,</hi> which has bin created according to <hi>GOD,</hi> in true <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> and <hi>Holiness.</hi> If we do not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Cloath our selves with this <hi>Robe,</hi> 'tis to be feared that <hi>God</hi> will reject us from his <hi>Feast;</hi> and that the Nakedness wherein he sees by the Corruption of the Old <hi>Man,</hi> with which we were <hi>Cloathed,</hi> will force him to bid his <hi>Servants</hi> to put us away from his <hi>Table,</hi> and cast us into utter Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that is to say, into such Darkness, as will hinder us from ever finding him.</p>

But the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> related afterwards by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs us in many important Truths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Kingdom of</hi> Heaven <hi>is as a Man</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling <hi>into a far</hi> Country, <hi>who called his own</hi> Servants, <hi>and delivered to them his</hi> Goods: <hi>Unto one he gave</hi> 5 Talents, <hi>to another</hi> 2, <hi>and to another</hi> 1; <hi>to every Man according to his several ability, and straightway took his</hi> Journey. <hi>He that received</hi> 5 Talents, <hi>went and traded with the same, and made them</hi> 5 <hi>more; and likewise he that received</hi> 2, <hi>gained</hi> 2 <hi>others; but he that received</hi> 1, <hi>went and hid it in the Earth, which rendred it useless. After a long time, the</hi> Lord <hi>of those Servants being return'd, called his</hi> Servants <hi>to account; and he that received</hi> 5 Talents, <hi>came and brought other</hi> 5 Talents, <hi>saying,</hi> Lord, <hi>thou deliveredst me</hi> 5 Talents, <hi>behold I have gained</hi> 5 <hi>more: His</hi> Lord <hi>said, Well done thou good and faithful Servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many things, Enter thou into the Joy of thy</hi> Lord. <hi>He also that had received the</hi> 2, <hi>brought also</hi> 2 <hi>others to his</hi> Lord, who likewise recompensed his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as he had done to the first. <hi>But he that received but</hi> 1 Talent, <hi>coming near to his</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <hi>told him,</hi> Lord, <hi>I know thee to be an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere Man, and that thou gatherest where thou hast not sowed; and therefore I was so afraid of thee, that I have hid thy</hi> Talent <hi>in the Ground, and lo here it is. His</hi> Master <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him,</hi> O <hi>thou wicked and slothful</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>seeing thou knewest I gathered where I did not sow, why didst not thou put the</hi> Money <hi>I gave thee into other Hands, that when I returned, I might have received my own with Usury? Take therefore the</hi> Talent <hi>from him, and give it to him that hath</hi> 10; <hi>for unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that hath, shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him that hath not, shall be taken away even that which he hath; and cast the unprofitable</hi> Servant <hi>into outer Darkness, where shall be weeping and gnash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> have trembled in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering this <hi>Parable:</hi> They have seen the danger wherein a Man falls, if he goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Measures set him by the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and if he does not also walk up to the Rules of it.</p>
                  <p>It was as dangerous to these <hi>Servants,</hi> to design the serving their <hi>Master,</hi> according to the <hi>Talent</hi> which he had given to others, as not to serve him according to the <hi>Talent</hi> which they had themselves received.</p>
                  <p>For as there is no greater <hi>Humility,</hi> than not to set about works of <hi>Charity</hi> beyond the Grace that <hi>GOD</hi> has bestowed on us; so there is no greater <hi>Misery,</hi> than to keep the Gifts of the <hi>Spirit</hi> unemployed. For the Severity used towards that Person, who had hid his <hi>Talent</hi> in a <hi>Napkin,</hi> has so awed considering <hi>Christians,</hi> that it made them vanquish their own Natures, and humbly surrender themselves to the Decrees of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> 'Tis certain, <hi>GOD</hi> is no hard <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> yet is it not to be imagined, that he has given us our Lives to no other purpose, than to take in and let out the <hi>Air.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Instruction</hi> was very necessary, to awaken us out of that drowzy <hi>Coldness,</hi> whereunto we are all too subject during this Life.</p>
                  <p>For tho' our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> has received from his <hi>Father</hi> a Sovereign Rule and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all the World; yet he seems to let Men loose, and to suffer all things to be confounded, as if he concern'd not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with them.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis certain, he exercises an <hi>Invisible Power</hi> over them, and which he will one day demonstrate with all <hi>Solemnity.</hi> And therefore 'tis, that he inculcates it to be a Man's greatest Wisdom in this Life, ever to remember this <hi>Judgment</hi> that is to come, and to be before hand with it, by judging our selves, that is, our <hi>Consciences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When (say he) the <hi>Son of Man</hi> shall come in his <hi>Majesty,</hi> attended by his <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> and all <hi>Nations</hi> shall come before his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; he shall then separate them as the <hi>Shepherd</hi> separates the <hi>Sheep</hi> from the <hi>Goats;</hi> for he shall set the <hi>Sheep</hi> on his right Hand, and the <hi>Goats</hi> on his left. Then shall he say to the one, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, receive the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the World: For I was an hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was a thirsty, and you gave me to drink: I was a Stranger, and you gave me entertainment; I was naked, and you cloathed me; I was sick, and you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me; I was in Prison, and you visited me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having said these comfortable words to the <hi>Righteous,</hi> which will surprize them, and sensibly inform them, That when they did these actions of <hi>Charity</hi> to the least of those which belong to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> they did it to himself; neither will he less surprize the <hi>Wicked,</hi> in reproaching them with their hardness of Heart, in that having seen him an <hi>hungry</hi> and <hi>thirsty,</hi> and in other Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they have not assisted him. They will ask of him, <hi>When saw we thee an hungred, or a thirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</hi> And <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> will plainly tell them, with the severest Anger, That when they refused all Kindness to the <hi>Poor,</hi> they refused it to himself, saying, <hi>In as much as ye did it not to the least of these, ye did it not to me;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Depart from me ye Cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus publickly extolled the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the one, and accused the <hi>Ingratitude</hi> of the others, he will bring the <hi>Good</hi> into <hi>everlasting Life,</hi> and throw the <hi>Wicked into everlasting Torments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> shews us in these words, That this <hi>Judgment</hi> will be a great surprize to most People, and that 'twill then be made manifest, how much we are deceived in our Accounts of <hi>Salvation.</hi> For 'tis plain from what our <hi>Saviour</hi> says both to the <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Unjust;</hi> that 'tis not sufficient to avoid <hi>Evil,</hi> but we must do <hi>Good;</hi> seeing <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> condemning the <hi>Wicked,</hi> doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them with Crimes, but only with the want of <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that according as the <hi>Fathers</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked from these words of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Our greatest trust which we can have in the <hi>Mercies of GOD,</hi> must arise from the exercise of <hi>Charity</hi> towards our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> in all the occasions which do offer themselves. And those who set about the <hi>working out of their Salvation</hi> in good earnest, do easily find them.</p>
                  <p>We can no where turn our selves, but we see some Object or other, that does e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven force our <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Compassion.</hi> The lewd and debauched do need our <hi>Prayers, That GOD would open their</hi> Eyes, <hi>and purifie their</hi> Understandings <hi>by</hi> Faith <hi>and</hi> Repentance, <hi>that they may not receive the wages of their</hi> Sins, <hi>which is</hi> eternal Death.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Disciple</hi>'s Treachery has made the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> admire and wonder at the goodness of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> who for all this desisted not from giving him his <hi>Body</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even as to the rest, with the same patience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he a while after suffered his <hi>Perfidious Salutation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church</hi> in all Ages has sighed and groaned, in considering that her holy <hi>Spouse</hi> doth every day suffer the same Indignity at the <hi>Altar,</hi> as he suffered then. She has testified her deep Sorrow, to see her self forced (as it were) to give our <hi>Saviour's</hi> pure <hi>Body</hi> to impure <hi>Souls;</hi> and has admired the <hi>Humility</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that he doth not come down from <hi>Heaven</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to punish those who thus unworthily receive him.</p>
                  <p>He is present at this Day at our <hi>Altars,</hi> as an Example to us of Patience, and if we be faithful to him, we must endeavour in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his <hi>Body,</hi> to be the Imitators of his ineffable <hi>Humility;</hi> and to lament the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched blindness of those who dishonour him by so many Sacrilegious <hi>Communions.</hi>

                  <p>AFter <hi>Judas</hi> had left our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to execute the design he had contracted with the <hi>Jews,</hi> our <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed LORD</hi> made an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Discourse to his <hi>Apostles;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same Year</hi> 33.</note> whereby he shewed us, in joyning the <hi>Word</hi> to his <hi>Body,</hi> that it also is the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment of our <hi>Souls,</hi> and that we ought not to part them, according to our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> own Example.</p>
                  <p>He at the same time said to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> That the <hi>Devil</hi> had desired to tempt him; but that he had prayed his <hi>Father</hi> for him. This <hi>Apostle,</hi> instead of humbling himself at these <hi>words</hi> and <hi>prayers</hi> of the Son of <hi>GOD</hi> in his hehalf, grew conceited of himself, as it soon after too plainly appeared. For our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ</hi> formally foretelling him, That he would Three times deny him before the <hi>Cock</hi> Crowed: He boldly answered him, He would never do it; and that he was so far from Renouncing him, that he was ready to go to <hi>Prison</hi> with him, yea, to die with him: so that the terrible prediction of his <hi>Fall,</hi> not being able to humble him, there was a necessity of doing it by the Fall it self.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> then having said these admirable Truths to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> contained in this last <hi>Sermon,</hi> he commanded them to take <hi>Arms</hi> with them; and thus they past over the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> to go (as he was wont) to the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Olives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Disciples</hi> followed him, and being come to a place called <hi>Gethsemane,</hi> he caused them to tarry there, that he might go alone into the <hi>Garden</hi> not far off, to <hi>pray</hi> there, according to his usual custom, and on this occasion was well known to <hi>Judas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He took only <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> with him, who were his chiefest Favourites, and who more immediately attended him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, he told them, That he was in great anguish of Spirit, even unto death, and therefore he desired them to watch with him whilst he <hi>prayed.</hi> He afterwards went from them about a Stones-cast, and falling upon his <hi>Face,</hi> he prayed, saying, <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be possible, let this Cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> And when our <hi>Saviour</hi> came to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> he found them asleep, and said, <hi>Could ye not watch with me one hour? watch and pray lest ye enter into Temptation; the Spirit indeed is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but the Flesh is weak.</hi> He went away the second time, and <hi>prayed</hi> as formerly, and returning he found them asleep, for their Eyes were heavy. Again our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> left them and <hi>prayed</hi> the same words. Then he came to them and said, <hi>Sleep on now, and take your rest, behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of Sinners. Rise let us go, he is at hand that betrays me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour's Agony</hi> was so great, altho' there was an <hi>Angel</hi> appeared to strengthen him, that he sweat drops of <hi>Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Passion</hi> in the <hi>Garden,</hi> has been the admiration and astonishment of <hi>Christians</hi> in all Ages; especially when they considered, how many <hi>People</hi> have gone joyfully to suffer <hi>Death</hi> but this might well happen to them, seeing their Case and our <hi>Saviours</hi> extreamly differed. For our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> bore on him the <hi>Iniquity</hi> and <hi>Punishment</hi> of us all; the <hi>Sins</hi> of the whole <hi>World</hi> lay on his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and he was to undergo the <hi>penalty</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>It is moreover to be considered, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Man,</hi> he was liable to all the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that state: For he was subject to <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> to <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> as we are. <hi>For it behoved him to be in all things, like unto us,</hi> Sin <hi>only excepted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prayer</hi> he thrice offered up to his <hi>Father,</hi> to remove this <hi>Cup</hi> from him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding at each time with <hi>submission</hi> to his <hi>Will,</hi> should serve as an excellent Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to us in all our <hi>Prayers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having shewed throughout his whole Life a perfect resignation to his <hi>Fathers</hi> Will, he seems to renew this Disposition at his Death. By which he learns us, That we ought chiefly to labour after this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Soul in all <hi>Afflictions</hi> and <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> but more especially at the Hour of <hi>Death;</hi> for then we shall have most occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to put his excellent Example in practice, and to say, <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done.</hi>

                  <p>OUR <hi>Saviour</hi> being o'erwhelmed with <hi>Sadness,</hi> when he was in an <hi>Agony</hi> in the <hi>Garden,</hi> gave us a great instance of his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;</hi>

                        <hi>The same year</hi> 33.</note>
for he came to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> to try, if peradventure he might find any <hi>Consolation</hi> in them, or any mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Grief.</hi> But he found not them in any sort disposed to <hi>wise Counsels,</hi> for they were fallen into a <hi>dead sleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He came thrice to awake them, with these important Words, <hi>Watch and Pray, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is willing, but the Flesh is weak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had no sooner done speaking to them the third time, but <hi>Judas</hi> appeared at the Head of a great Company of People bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms. <hi>Judas</hi> had given them a Sign, whereby they should know, which was the <hi>Person</hi> they should lay hold on, to the end he might not make his escape from them, and so occasion more trouble in taking him.</p>
                  <p>He came then boldly up to the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World, and treacherously kist him, saying, <hi>Hail Master;</hi> which our <hi>Blessed Lord</hi> patiently endured, and with the same kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as heretofore, to teach us, To bear gently with such Persons as are like him, and not to be sharp and spightful at the ill usages of <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Domesticks.</hi> Yet he said to him, <hi>Wherefore comest thou hither? Dost thou betray the Son of Man with a Kiss?</hi> Which Words were rather spoken, to bring him to a thoughtfulness of what he did than to complain of his <hi>Ingratitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Kiss</hi> of <hi>Judas,</hi> our <hi>Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> (who had heretofore fled, when the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> would have made him a <hi>King</hi>) went to meet those who came to take him, asking them, <hi>Whom they sought</hi>? and that with so powerful a <hi>Voice,</hi> as made them all to fall flat on the Ground; shewing by this means, That 'twas not want of <hi>Power</hi> made him suffer Death; but that he underwent it of his own free will. He then surrendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to these <hi>wicked People,</hi> having an eye to the <hi>Power</hi> which GOD had given them.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> endeavoured to defend Him from them, drew out his <hi>Sword,</hi> and cut off the Ear of <hi>Malchus,</hi> who was a Servant to the <hi>High Priest:</hi> But our <hi>Saviour</hi> was so far from delighting in this <hi>Resistance,</hi> and permitting this just <hi>Revenge,</hi> that immediately he heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Wound,</hi> and reprehended S. <hi>Peter</hi> for making it; saying, <hi>Put up thy</hi> Sword <hi>into his place; for all they that take the</hi> Sword, <hi>shall perish by the</hi> Sword.</p>
                  <p>He told him he needed not his <hi>Arm</hi> to deliver him; for had he not fully determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to drink of this <hi>Cup, He could pray to his</hi> Father, <hi>and he would presently give him more than</hi> 12 Legions <hi>of</hi> Angels, <hi>to assist him; But how then shall the</hi> Scriptures <hi>be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He suffered himself then to be bound on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saying to the <hi>Officers,</hi> That they needed not to have come out against him, as if he were a <hi>Thief,</hi> or a <hi>Murtherer;</hi> seeing he was every day in the <hi>Temple,</hi> where they might have laid hold on him.</p>
                  <p>Being then secured in their Hands, all his <hi>Disciples</hi> fled, and left him alone with them; <hi>And when they had laid hold on him, they led him away to</hi> Caiaphas <hi>the</hi> High-Priest, <hi>where the</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Elders <hi>were assembled, and</hi> Peter <hi>followed afar off.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by this, To comfort those who should fall by surprize into the hands of their <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He knew, that they were to come to take him, and he did not avoid them, because he knew it was his <hi>Fathers</hi> Will; to the end, that those who should fall into a like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without knowing it, should adore (as he did) the Power of <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>Men;</hi> and not suffer themselves to be carried away by fruitless <hi>Complaints</hi> and <hi>Repinings.</hi> For there is nothing comes amiss to him, who consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>That he suffers nothing, but what a most</hi> Divine Person <hi>suffered before him; and that the</hi> Sufferings <hi>of this present Life, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared to the</hi> Glory <hi>which shall be revealed.</hi>

who was <hi>High Priest</hi> that Year. <hi>Annas</hi> interrogated him touching his <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Doctrine;</hi> whereunto our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> replied, <hi>That he had not Taught in secret, so that he might be informed by every Body of that matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this freedom of Speech displeasing an <hi>Officer</hi> which stood near our <hi>Saviour,</hi> he gave him a blow on the <hi>Face,</hi> and ask'd him, Whether it became him, to answer the <hi>High Priest</hi> in that manner?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> suffered this Indignity with a <hi>Divine Patience,</hi> and only bade this Person, to tell him what he had spoke amiss, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he that smote him would shew himself to blame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Annas</hi> after this sent him to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> at whose House the <hi>Chief Priests</hi> were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to confer about the Charge they were to exhibit against him; and, if need were, to find <hi>false Witnesses;</hi> who being brought, they could make out nothing that was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to take away his Life: But at last, one amongst them accusing him for having said, <hi>That he would destroy the</hi> Temple, <hi>and build it up again in Three Days.</hi> The <hi>High Priest</hi> arose, and ask'd him, Why he made no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against this Accusation? <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> observed still a profound Silence, which made the <hi>High Priest</hi> command him, in the Name of the Most High <hi>GOD,</hi> to tell them, if he were the <hi>Christ</hi>?

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>High Priest</hi> having heard these words, rent his <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and cried out, He has spoken <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> What need have we of further <hi>Witnesses</hi>?

                  <p>The Night being thus spent, in the Morning they led him to <hi>Pilate,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Sentence on him. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who had followed <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> at a distance into the House of the <hi>High Priest,</hi> and warmed himself by the <hi>Fire</hi> with the <hi>Officers,</hi> lost that Heat which he had shewed before, and his Courage changed into an excessive <hi>Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness;</hi> when a <hi>Servant Maid</hi> asked him, Whether he had not been with <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>? He answered, No. And having a while after charged him with the same Question, he renounced him, (as he had done before) saying, That he knew not the <hi>Man.</hi> In fine, About an Hour after one of the <hi>High Priest's</hi> Servants, a Kinsman of him whose Ear <hi>Peter</hi> had cut off, positively affirmed, that he was with <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it again the third time with horrid <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Imprecations;</hi> and immediately the <hi>Cock</hi> Crew; and our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> looking on him, touched him to the <hi>Quick,</hi> and made him remember what had been said to him; and thereupon <hi>he went out and wept bitterly.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>JEsus Christ</hi> was led from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> who demanded of the <hi>Jews,</hi> What were the chief Heads of their Accusations against this Man?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same Year</hi> 33.</note> But the <hi>Jews</hi> answered him confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That if he had not been a wicked <hi>Man,</hi> they would not have brought him before him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pilate</hi> not being accustomed to judge <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> upon such slight Grounds, would have remitted him into their Hands again, that they might judge him according to their own <hi>Law.</hi> But to satisfie him they produced false <hi>Witnesses,</hi> who making no mention of <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Temple,</hi> as they did before the <hi>High Priest,</hi> affirmed, That he was a <hi>seditious Fellow;</hi> that he stirred up the <hi>People</hi> to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> and hindred them from giving Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Caesar, Calling himself a KING.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon <hi>Pilate</hi> came to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who spake freely to him touching himself, and of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and that 'twas not of this <hi>World;</hi> his only Business amongst Men being to instruct them in the <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pilate</hi> not being prejudiced with <hi>Malice</hi> against his <hi>Person,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, easily discovered our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Innocency, and went to the <hi>Jews</hi> again to tell them, that he found him in no sort culpable.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>People</hi> being impatient at the hearing of this, he was constrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and question him again; but he remained in a deep Silence. <hi>Pilate</hi> shewed him what a great number of <hi>Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> were laid against him; unto all which <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> answered nothing, so that he astonished the <hi>Judge</hi> with his Silence.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Governour</hi> understanding, that our <hi>Saviour Jesus Christ</hi> was of <hi>Galilee,</hi> he would make this a <hi>Pretence</hi> to be discharged of him, and sent him therefore to <hi>Herod,</hi> who was King of that <hi>Province,</hi> and was then at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herod</hi> was at first over joy'd at the Sight of him; for having of a long time heard much of him, he was glad of this opportunity to <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nverse</hi> with him, and expected also, that he would do some <hi>Miracle</hi> before him. But having offered to him several <hi>Questions,</hi> to which our <hi>Saviour</hi> made no answer: This <hi>Prince</hi> therefore despised him, and esteemed him a <hi>Fool,</hi> and caused therefore a <hi>white Robe</hi> to be put on him, and sent him thus array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back again to <hi>Pilate,</hi> with whom he was then reconciled, so that they became <hi>Friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pilate</hi> having received our <hi>Saviour,</hi> went out the third time to tell the <hi>Jews,</hi> That he found no <hi>Fault</hi> in him, and that <hi>Herod</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to whom he had sent him, could not find him <hi>guilty</hi> of any thing. But the <hi>Jews</hi> being resolved to put our <hi>Saviour</hi> to Death, shewed by the <hi>Shouts</hi> and <hi>Uproars</hi> they made that they liked not <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Opinion of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore thinking to asswage their <hi>Rage,</hi> and to gratifie their revengeful <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> condemned our <hi>Saviour</hi> to be scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, imagining that this <hi>Punishment</hi> might be a means to make him escape <hi>Death</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Judas</hi> when he saw how far the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our <hi>Saviour</hi> began to carry their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> came to himself; and considering the <hi>Crime</hi> he had committed, was seized with <hi>Despair,</hi> which made him bring back to the <hi>Jews</hi> the <hi>Thirty pieces</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> which he had received of them; telling them, He had <hi>sinned,</hi> in betraying <hi>Innocent Blood;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thrown his <hi>Money</hi> into the <hi>Temple,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went away, and <hi>hanged himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Disciple,</hi> whose Heart the <hi>Devil</hi> had corrupted, and whose <hi>Malice GOD</hi> had made subservient to his <hi>Eternal Designs,</hi> is a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Example of the manner of the <hi>Devil's</hi> imposing on <hi>Men.</hi> He disguises the <hi>Mischief</hi> whereunto he would cast them, he blinds their <hi>Eyes</hi> lest they should behold it, and so artificially colours it, that they cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ugliness of it. But as soon as they have committed it, he makes use of a quite contrary Course; aggravating their <hi>Sin,</hi> with the severe Justice of <hi>GOD;</hi> and thus brings them to <hi>Despair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those <hi>Christians</hi> that would escape his Snares, must be sensible of their <hi>Sins,</hi> which are innumerable, and also be sensible of the <hi>Mercies</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> which knows no bounds; for there is no <hi>Mala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>PILATE</hi> having delivered <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to the <hi>Soldiers,</hi> they added cruel <hi>Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> to the punishment of <hi>Scourging;</hi>

                        <hi>The same Year</hi> 33.</note> and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision of his Royal Dignity, they put a <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Thorns</hi> on his <hi>Head,</hi> a <hi>Reed</hi> in his <hi>Hand,</hi> and <hi>cloathed</hi> him in a <hi>Purple Robe.</hi> They after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bowed the <hi>Knee</hi> before him, and <hi>buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting</hi> him, said, <hi>Hail King of the Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, They had so pitiously used him, that <hi>Pilate</hi> thought the shewing him to the <hi>People</hi> would be sufficient to <hi>mollifie</hi> them, and to make them lay aside their thirst after his <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he was much mistaken in his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for as soon as he had presented <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hefore them, saying, <hi>Behold the Man!</hi> there arose such Cries and Clamours from all the <hi>People,</hi> that much troubled him. Even the offer which he made them of delivering our <hi>Saviour</hi> on the account of the <hi>Passover;</hi> at which time he was wont to set at liberty one certain Person; was by one common Voice rejected; so that our <hi>Blessed LORD</hi> saw <hi>Barabbas,</hi> who was a <hi>Thief,</hi> a <hi>seditious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> preferred before him.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge that this <hi>Judge</hi> had of the innocency of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> held him in suspence, and hindred him from blindly following the fury of the <hi>People:</hi> He was also further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed by the Advice of his <hi>Wife,</hi> who char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him not to be any ways concerned in the Death of that <hi>Just Man,</hi> for she had been much troubled on this occasion with <hi>Dreams</hi> in the Night.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while the <hi>Jews,</hi> who would not give over their prosecution; cunningly told <hi>Pilate,</hi> That he shewed but small affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> in taking such a <hi>Man's</hi> part, who had declared himself a <hi>King,</hi> in opposition to <hi>Caesa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Governour,</hi> who was very careful of his Fortune, and very little concern'd for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> could not hold out any longer against these words. Wherefore finding all his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnesses</hi> were fruitless, and that the more he endeavoured to save him, the more he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a <hi>Tumult,</hi> he caused <hi>Water</hi> to be brought him, and thought to do away the <hi>horrible Crime</hi> he was about committing, by washing his <hi>Hands</hi> before all the <hi>People,</hi> in saying, He was not guilty of the <hi>Blood</hi> of this <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He soon after pronounced the Sentence of <hi>Death</hi> on our <hi>Saviour,</hi> delivered him into the hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and set <hi>Barabbas</hi> at liberty.</p>
                  <p>There was never any greater instance than this Action of <hi>Pilate,</hi> to shew how far the desire which the <hi>People</hi> of the World have to satisfie their <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Interests,</hi> will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them. He sets at naught whatever he knew of the Dignity and Innocency of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ:</hi> He neglects the Advice of his <hi>Wife,</hi> which he ought to have respected as the warnings of <hi>Heaven;</hi> and treading un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot all the <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>good inclinations</hi> which he had to protect a <hi>Just Man</hi> opprest; he condemned <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> not out of <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, nor out of <hi>Covetousness,</hi> as <hi>Judas;</hi> but only out of a <hi>timerous humour,</hi> that he might not expose himself to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being out of favour at <hi>Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 27th. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> is set forth our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s being delivered to <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> the <hi>Governour;</hi> how <hi>Judas</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him, when he saw he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, repented, and brought the 30 pieces of <hi>Silver</hi> which he received for betraying him to the <hi>Chief Priests,</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> telling them he had sinned in betraying <hi>Innocent Blood;</hi> they answered him, What is that to us? see thou to that. Then casting down the <hi>Silver</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> he went out and <hi>hanged</hi> himself: That with this <hi>Silver</hi> they bought a piece of Ground, called the <hi>Potters-Field,</hi> to Bury Strangers in, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Blood.</hi> How <hi>Pilate</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished by his <hi>Wife,</hi> not to have his hands in the <hi>Blood</hi> of that <hi>Innocent Man,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Clamours of the <hi>People</hi> prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, that he pronounced <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> which accordingly was <hi>Executed.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Holy Fathers <hi>have observed on this passage of the</hi> Gospel, <hi>That there's nothing but</hi> Charity <hi>which can make us prefer our</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science <hi>and</hi> Salvation, <hi>to whatever we may lose in the</hi> World.</p>
                  <p>Words <hi>are vain,</hi> Thoughts <hi>are weak,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions <hi>are too often broken; it must be</hi> GOD <hi>that works in us by the secret motions of his</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, <hi>to keep us in any thing that is good.

                  <p>The Son of <hi>GOD</hi> assures us, That whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever takes not up his <hi>Cross,</hi> and follows him, is not worthy to be his <hi>Disciple,</hi> for he hath first carried it himself, to the end we might be perswaded by his <hi>Example,</hi> if we could not be so by his <hi>Words.</hi>

                  <p>The holy <hi>Women</hi> that had followed <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and had assisted him during his <hi>Preachings,</hi> attended him when he thus carried his <hi>Cross</hi> to <hi>Calvary,</hi> shewing by their <hi>Sighs</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> what a share they had in his <hi>Sufferings;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> speaks only to them, saying, <hi>Daughters of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>weep not for me, but rather for your selves.</hi> He will not be lamented, though his <hi>Cross</hi> excessively deserved it; teaching us there by, That we ought not to bewail our selves in our <hi>Afflictions</hi> above measure, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be little, or great, nor suffer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to lament for us.</p>
                  <p>The time, says he, will come, in which it will be said, <hi>Blessed are the Barren, and the Breasts which have not given Suck;</hi> Then shall they say to the <hi>Mountains, Fall on us;</hi> for if these things be done unto the <hi>green Tree,</hi> what will become of the <hi>dry?</hi>

                  <p>When they were discoursing in the way, of whatever had happened to our <hi>Saviour;</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> taking on him the form or habit of a <hi>Traveller,</hi> drew near to them, and dimm'd their <hi>Eyes,</hi> that they should not know him.

                  <p>One of them answered him, He was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished that he alone should be ignorant of what had past at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> lately, touching <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who was a <hi>Prophet</hi> mighty in <hi>Word</hi> and in <hi>Deed,</hi> before <hi>GOD</hi> and all the <hi>People,</hi> and how the high <hi>Priests,</hi> and Rulers delivered him to be condemn'd to Death, and have <hi>Crucified</hi> him: And we hoped, added they, that he should have delivered <hi>Israel;</hi> but this is the third day since this happen'd. Not but that, said they, some good <hi>Women</hi> have startled us, in affirming, That having been at the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> before day, they could not find his Body there: They also say, that they saw <hi>Angels</hi> there, who told them, That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was <hi>risen.</hi> And some from among us being gone to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,</hi> found what these <hi>Women</hi> told us to be true, and could not in effect find his <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> admiring the <hi>Disciples</hi> should tell him all that was necessary to induce them to believe, when as yet they persisted in their <hi>Incredulity,</hi> cried out, O insensible and incredulous to all which the <hi>Prophet</hi> has foretold! Ought not <hi>Christ</hi> to have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered these things, and thus enter into his <hi>Glory?</hi> And beginning from <hi>Moses,</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through with all the other <hi>Prophets,</hi> he expounded to them whatever had been said of him.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he spake to them after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they drew near to <hi>Emaus;</hi> and our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> made as if he would have went farther, but they constrained him to tarry with them; it being already late, our <hi>Saviour</hi> yielded to their Entreaties, and entred with them into the <hi>Inn,</hi> and being at <hi>Table,</hi> he took <hi>Bread,</hi> blessed it, and gave it to them.</p>
                  <p>At this instant their <hi>Eyes</hi> were opened, and they knew our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who vanish'd from them, leaving them full of astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and asking one another, Whether their <hi>Hearts</hi> were not inflamed, whilst he expounded to them the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> They arose at the same time, and went to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to find the Eleven <hi>Apostles,</hi> to whom they declared what had happened, and in what manner they had known <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> when he gave them <hi>Bread;</hi> and as they thus spake, <hi>Jesus</hi> stood in the midst of them, and said unto them, <hi>Peace be unto you.</hi> But they were terrified and afrighted, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing him a <hi>Spirit.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, having appeared several times together for the space of forty days, either to all of them, or to some of them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, when the time of his <hi>Ascension</hi> was come, he stood in the midst of his <hi>Disciples,</hi> declaring to them, He had received from his <hi>Father</hi> all <hi>Power</hi> both in <hi>Heaven</hi> and in <hi>Earth,</hi> and he sent them into the <hi>World</hi> to preach the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to <hi>Baptize</hi> all <hi>Nations,</hi> and teach them to observe whatever he had told them, promising them to be with them to the end of the <hi>World.</hi> And said unto them, behold, I send the <hi>promise</hi> of my <hi>Father</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, but tarry ye in the City of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> until ye be endued with Power from on high.</p>

                  <p>Whilst they stood gazing on him, two <hi>Men</hi> cloathed in <hi>white</hi> appeared to them, who asked them, why they held their <hi>Eyes</hi> thus fixed towards <hi>Heaven?</hi> assuring them, that this same <hi>Jesus</hi> who thus ascended up into <hi>Heaven</hi> before their <hi>Eyes,</hi> should one day in like manner descend to <hi>Judge</hi> the whole <hi>Earth.</hi> And they worshiped him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and returned to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with great <hi>joy,</hi> and were continually in the <hi>Temple,</hi> praising and blessing <hi>GOD.</hi>

                  <p>During this time, St. <hi>Peter</hi> being inspir'd of <hi>GOD,</hi> said to the other <hi>Disciples,</hi> that to fill the place of <hi>Judas,</hi> who had betray'd our <hi>Saviour,</hi> they should elect one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those who had been always with <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> since the Baptism of S. <hi>John,</hi> to his <hi>Ascension;</hi> And therefore two <hi>Disciples</hi> having been chosen from amongst others, <hi>Joseph</hi> surnamed the <hi>Just,</hi> and <hi>Matthias;</hi> they prayed to <hi>GOD,</hi> who presides over <hi>Lots,</hi> to shew which of these Two he had chosen to be an <hi>Apostle,</hi> and the <hi>Lot</hi> fell on S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias.</hi>

                  <p>He took him at the same time by the <hi>Hand,</hi> lifted him up, and immediately his <hi>Feet</hi> and <hi>Ancle-bones</hi> received strength, so that he stood firmly, and walked steddily. He also leaped for Joy, and entred into the <hi>Temple</hi> with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to praise <hi>GOD</hi> in the Sight of the <hi>People</hi> for this Favour, who were greatly surprized at the <hi>Miracle,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving known this <hi>Man</hi> of a long time.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> observing, that all the People gazed on them, asked them why they beheld them with such Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if they had been the Authors of this <hi>Miracle;</hi> which made S. <hi>Peter</hi> to tell them, 'twas in the Name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> through <hi>Faith</hi> in his Name, that this <hi>Man</hi> is cured and made strong, which ye see and know; hence S. <hi>Peter</hi> took Occasion, to represent to them the <hi>Crime</hi> they had committed in putting our <hi>Saviour</hi> to Death; which he yet in some sort extenuated, in saying, They did it through <hi>Ignorance.</hi> He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards exhorted them to <hi>Repentance,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as an Encouragement, That 'twas to them <hi>GOD</hi> had first sent his <hi>Son,</hi> and that they were the Children of the <hi>Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Five Thousand were converted by this his Discourse, and then the <hi>Rulers</hi> came, being much troubled at their Exhortations to the <hi>People,</hi> and preaching our <hi>Saviour's Resurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They seized on the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and threw them into <hi>Prison,</hi> till they had finished their Consultations. The next Morning they caused S. <hi>Peter</hi> to be brought before them, and ask'd him in whose Name they had done this <hi>Miracle</hi>?</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> boldly replied, in the Name of the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> whom they had Crucified. These <hi>Priests</hi> observing the Constancy and Wisdom wherewith they spake, whom they knew to be Illiterate and Ignorant <hi>Men,</hi> they caused them for a while to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, that they might have further time to deliberate what to do with them; and considering how publick this <hi>Miracle</hi> was, which they came from doing; they thought it best to have them recall'd, and to give them a strict Charge, never to speak in this Man's Name any more.</p>
                  <p>But S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> appealed to themselves, whether it was more just to obey them than GOD, who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to declare what they had <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>heard.</hi> But these <hi>Priests</hi> making no reply, sent them away with great Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
                  <p>This Answer of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was in the Hands of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> shews such an unshaken Courage, together with such Wisdom, as all the <hi>Saints</hi> have admired; who when they have seen themselves in such like Occasions, where <hi>GOD</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Men</hi> on the other, command them contrary things, they have imitated the Wisdom of this <hi>Holy Man,</hi> in saying, with as great Humility as Constancy; We must not obey <hi>Men</hi> rather than <hi>GOD.</hi>

                  <head>The Death of <hi>ANANIAS</hi> and <hi>SAPHIRA</hi> his Wife.</head>
                  <p>SAint <hi>Peter</hi> being come out from the Assembly of the <hi>Jews</hi> came with Saint <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> to the <hi>Disciples,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The same Year</hi> 33.</note> who were in great Trouble for them. They informed them how all things had past, and the Threatnings which the <hi>Priests</hi> had used towards them; which the <hi>Disciples</hi> having heard, they all unanimously lifted up their Voices to <hi>GOD,</hi> entreating him to consider the Threats of these <hi>Men,</hi> who had conspired against his <hi>Son;</hi> and to give Grace to his <hi>People,</hi> to <hi>preach</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> with all Boldness.</p>
                  <p>When they had ended their <hi>Prayer,</hi> the Place shook where they stood, and they were all filled with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and preached the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> with great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. All those that received the <hi>Faith</hi> had but one <hi>Heart,</hi> and one <hi>Soul,</hi> no <hi>Body</hi> amongst them possessing any thing in private, all that which they had being in common, so that there were no <hi>Poor</hi> amongst them; for when any one of the <hi>Faithful</hi> had <hi>Lands,</hi> they sold them, and brought the <hi>Money,</hi> and laid it at the <hi>Apostles</hi> Feet, who afterwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed it according as every one had need.</p>
                  <p>The whole <hi>City</hi> had an extream respect for these first <hi>Faithful,</hi> and when they were in the <hi>Temple,</hi> no Body durst joyn himself unto them. In the mean time S. <hi>Peter</hi> (both by his <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Preachings</hi>) increased the Number of the <hi>Disciples,</hi> healing the <hi>Sick</hi> with his <hi>Shadow</hi> only. All <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the <hi>Cities</hi> round about, came and placed their <hi>Sick</hi> in the <hi>Streets,</hi> to the end, that in passing by, his <hi>Shadow</hi> might light on them and heal them.</p>
                  <p>Thus when the <hi>Faithful</hi> were filled with the <hi>Consolation</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an Action which troubled their Joy, and shewed the Power of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in another manner than the miraculous <hi>Cures</hi> that he had hitherto done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ananias</hi> having sold an <hi>Estate,</hi> resolved with his Wife <hi>Saphira,</hi> to retain secretly a part of the <hi>Money,</hi> and came and brought the rest, and laid it at the <hi>Apostles</hi> Feet. S. <hi>Peter</hi> was wounded at the <hi>Heart</hi> at the Sight of this <hi>Covetousness,</hi> joyned with a <hi>Dissimulation,</hi> which seemed to put upon GOD himself: He therefore demanded of <hi>Ananias,</hi> why he suffered himself to be so surprized by the <hi>Devil,</hi> as to <hi>lye</hi> to the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> in keeping back part of the <hi>Money. Could you not</hi> (said he) <hi>have kept your Estate without selling it; or keep the Money after you have sold it? You have not attempted to deceive</hi> Men, <hi>but GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Words,</hi> were Words of <hi>Thunder</hi> for <hi>Ananias,</hi> and he fell down dead at the same instant. Three Hours after, his Wife <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira</hi> (not knowing of the Death of her <hi>Husband</hi>) entred in where S. <hi>Peter</hi> was, of whom he demanded, Whether 'twas true they had sold their <hi>Estate</hi> for so much? She answered, <hi>It was</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> S. <hi>Peter</hi> said the same to her as to her <hi>Husband;</hi> and added, that the Persons which came from carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her <hi>Husband</hi> were at the Door, and would carry her away in like manner. This <hi>Woman</hi> fell down dead at the same instant, and these Men entring, carried and buried her with her <hi>Husband.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What hapned to these Two Persons, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a great Terror amongst the <hi>Faithful.</hi> They learnt from so visible a Judgment of <hi>GOD,</hi> how displeasing <hi>Covetousness</hi> is in his Sight, and how contrary to that Spirit of <hi>Charity,</hi> which he has spread among <hi>Christians.</hi> If the Process of Time, and the Corruption of Manners have introduced it since, the <hi>Church</hi> has no less Horror at it at present, than she shewed then in the Person of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> She strikes no longer with a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Death those who are subject to her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she would have too many Persons to punish. She knows that <hi>GOD</hi> speaks but one, and after this retires, to give place to <hi>Faith,</hi> who believes also as certainly what was seen but once, as if it should happen every Day.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, this Espouse of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> laments continualy the invisible Death of so many <hi>covetous Persons,</hi> who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour her <hi>Spouse,</hi> and who make of the <hi>Church,</hi> (according to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and Words of S. <hi>Bernard</hi>) a Den of <hi>Thieves,</hi> who live on Prey and Labour only to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Spoils of <hi>Passengers.</hi>

                  <p>WHen the <hi>Church</hi> daily increased, the <hi>Sadduces</hi> were those who shewed most displeasure at it: They seized on the <hi>Apostles,</hi>

At the same time other Persons came and told them, That they spake publickly to the <hi>People.</hi> Order was immediately thereupon given, to lay hold on them, and bring them into the <hi>Assembly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>High Priest</hi> demanded of them, Why they <hi>Preached</hi> in the name of <hi>Jesus</hi>? To whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> returned the same Answer as heretofore, That <hi>they ought rather to obey GOD than</hi> Men.</p>
                  <p>At these <hi>Words</hi> they became furious, and consulted together, to put them to Death: But <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> one of the most considerable <hi>Persons</hi> amongst them, recommended to them the taking heed of what they did. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred them of some Passages which late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hapned; by which he shewed, That if this <hi>Enterprize</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> were of Men, they would dissipate of themselves; but if of <hi>GOD,</hi> all resistance would be in vain.</p>
                  <p>They were somewhat cooled by these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances, contenting themselves with causing the <hi>Apostles</hi> to be Scourged, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them to speak ever hereafter of <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Apostles</hi> came out from the Council full of Joy, in that they had been judged worthy to suffer for the Name of <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some time after there arose a Misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing among the <hi>Faithful.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> Converts supposing their <hi>Widows</hi> were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and that only those of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were admitted to certain Offices to which they were appointed, complained of this Slighting to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who bad them choose seven <hi>Men</hi> amongst them who were filled with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that the burden of these Cares might be laid on them. Of these Seven (which were called <hi>Deacons</hi>) the most considerable amongst them was S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who wrought a great many <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> by reason of the greatness of his <hi>Faith.</hi> At the same time several <hi>Enemies</hi> rose up against them; but they were not able to resist the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which spake by his Mouth. Being then too weak for him in point of Reasoning, they had recourse to <hi>false Witnesses,</hi> and gained Persons who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished amongst the People, That <hi>Stephen</hi> ceased not to <hi>blaspheme</hi> against the Law of the <hi>Temple.</hi> He was cited before the <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> where he defended himself with words full of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi> He reproached the <hi>Jews</hi> with the hardness of their <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> whereby they resisted the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and persecuted the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who foretold the Coming of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> of whom they were lately the <hi>Betrayers</hi> and <hi>Murtherers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Reproaches</hi> transporting them into Fury, they ran impetuously on S. <hi>Stephen;</hi> who having appeared (during this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) with the Countenance of an <hi>Angel,</hi> cried out at length, That he saw <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Jesus</hi> sitting at the right Hand of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> They haled him immediately out of the <hi>Town</hi> and whilst they were <hi>Stoning</hi> him, this <hi>holy Man</hi> kneeling on the Ground, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>GOD</hi> with a loud Voice, to forgive his <hi>Persecutors;</hi> and he gave up the <hi>Ghost</hi> in this <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church</hi> has celebrated chiefly in this <hi>Proto-Martyr,</hi> the <hi>Charity</hi> he shewed for those who put him to Death. Herein he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially appeared to be the true <hi>Disciple</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and shewed, that the <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Liberty</hi> with which he spake, was only an effect of his great Love to them. 'Tis not to hate <hi>Men,</hi> to shew them with earnestness the great Abuses they commit. No Body loved the <hi>Jews</hi> better than <hi>S. Stephen,</hi> and yet he reproaches them boldly with their <hi>Obstinacy.</hi> Yet these <hi>Reproaches</hi> are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bitterness, wrath, and clamor. <hi>He was a</hi> Dove (saith S. <hi>Austin) whose Passion was without any Gall: He speaks earnestly to them, to vanquish the hardness of their Hearts; but he at the same time burns with</hi> Zeal <hi>for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and offers to GOD his</hi> Blood, <hi>for those who shed it.</hi>

                  <p>ONE of the Advantages which the <hi>Church</hi> received by the Death of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> was the encrease of the <hi>Persecution,</hi>

                  <p>About this time S. <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Deacon</hi> went to <hi>Samaria,</hi> where he Preached the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and Converted several Persons, who were affected with the holiness of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the great number of his <hi>Miracles.</hi> When they all came in Crouds to be Baptized, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who was a great <hi>Magician,</hi> and had for a long time seduced the whole Town of <hi>Samaria</hi> by his <hi>Enchantments,</hi> did also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, caused himself to be <hi>Baptized,</hi> and became S. <hi>Philip</hi>'s <hi>Disciple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Apostles,</hi> who remained at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> during the Persecution, hearing that the Town of <hi>Samaria</hi> had embraced the <hi>Faith,</hi> sent thither S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> to confer on them the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which they had not yet received.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simon</hi> observing, that these two <hi>Apostles</hi> conferred the gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> by the Imposition of Hands, came and offered them <hi>Mony,</hi> entreating them to give him this Power, to the end that all those on whom he should lay his <hi>Hands,</hi> should also receive the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> was moved with a just Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against this Man; <hi>Thy money Perish with thee,</hi> answered he, who believest the <hi>Gift of GOD</hi> is to be purchased at that rate.

                  <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> having finished at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> what they had to do, returned thence to <hi>

The <hi>Eunuch</hi> returned this meek Answer to <hi>Philip,</hi> That he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Interpreter. He therefore prayed him to get up into his <hi>Chariot,</hi> and expound it unto him. The Passage was this, <hi>He was led as a Sheep to the slaughter, and opened not his mouth: He remained silent as a Sheep before the Shepherds.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Eunuch</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Philip</hi> to inform him, of whom the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> spake in this Place; whether of himself or of some other. <hi>Philip</hi> took thence an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to declare <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> unto him. And the <hi>Eunuch</hi> believed what-ever was shewed him. The <hi>Chariot</hi> being then come to a place where there was <hi>Water,</hi> he caused it to stop, and demanded what hindred his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Baptized? Philip</hi> answered him, That if he believed, he knew no Impedient: Which the <hi>Eunuch</hi> affirming, they both descended into the <hi>Water,</hi> where <hi>Philip</hi> baptized him; who was, as it were, the first Fruits of his <hi>Gentilism,</hi> When he came out of the <hi>Water</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> took up <hi>Philip,</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> saw him no more, praising <hi>GOD,</hi> with great Transports of <hi>Joy,</hi> for the <hi>Grace</hi> he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</p>
                  <p>This seems, as if <hi>GOD</hi> intended in this occasion, to instruct such as do Idolize the Persons of those who have instructed them in the <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Eunuch</hi> had no sooner received from <hi>Philip</hi> the knowledge of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> but <hi>GOD</hi> took him away from him; and so far was he from afflicting himself hereupon, that he continued on his way <hi>praising GOD,</hi> and rejoycing in <hi>believing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>GOD <hi>makes use of</hi> Men, <hi>as</hi> Instruments <hi>to convert us, and does permit us to reverence them in a subordinate degree. But at the same time, he expects we should pass over from them to him, there to find our true</hi> Joy <hi>and</hi> Strength, <hi>remembring that he that plants, and he that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are nothing, seeing 'tis</hi> GOD <hi>who gives the increase.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For when <hi>Saul</hi> breathed nothing but <hi>Blood,</hi> and the slaughter of the <hi>Christians,</hi> and had obtained <hi>Letters</hi> from the <hi>Chief Priests</hi> to go to <hi>Damascus,</hi> to apprehend all the <hi>Christians</hi> he could find, and bring them bound to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> he was immediately surrounded with a <hi>shining Light,</hi> which struck him to the ground, and he heard a Voice which said unto him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test thou me</hi>? Who art thou <hi>LORD</hi>? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered he: <hi>I am</hi> JESUS, <hi>whom thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutest.</hi> And <hi>Saul</hi> trembling at this word, cried out, <hi>LORD, what wilt thou have me to do? Jesus Christ</hi> commanded him to arise, and to go into the <hi>City,</hi> where he should be told what should be expected from him.</p>
                  <p>Those who accompanied him in this <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> or <hi>Journey,</hi> were surprized at this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. They heard a <hi>Voice,</hi> but saw not whence it came: And <hi>Saul</hi> arising from the Ground, opened his <hi>Eyes,</hi> but could not see, and therefore they led him by the hand as far as <hi>Damascus,</hi> where he was for three days without his <hi>sight,</hi> as also without <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>drinking</hi> any thing.</p>
                  <p>There was in this Town a <hi>Disciple</hi> named <hi>Ananias,</hi> whom <hi>GOD</hi> commanded in the <hi>Night</hi> to go into a <hi>Street</hi> he named to him, and to enquire in the House of <hi>Judas</hi> for one called <hi>Saul,</hi> who was of <hi>Tarsus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ananias</hi> shewed at first some unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, alledging, he had heard of this Man, and the mischief he had done at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to all the <hi>Christians,</hi> and that he came only to <hi>Damascus</hi> to carry away <hi>Captives</hi> all those who called upon his Name. But <hi>GOD</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to do what he had enjoyned him; because <hi>Saul</hi> was a chosen Vessel, to carry his Name before <hi>Kings,</hi> and all the People of the <hi>Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He went then to seek him in the place related to him. He put his <hi>Hands</hi> on him, and said unto him, <hi>Brother</hi> Saul, <hi>the</hi> Lord Jesus <hi>that appeared to thee in the Way, has sent me to thee, to the end thou maist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> recover thy Sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</hi> At the same time things like <hi>Scales</hi> dropt from his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and he saw clear, and was <hi>Baptized:</hi> And having received Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he recovered his strength, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some days at <hi>Damascus</hi> with the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Preaching in the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of the <hi>Jews, That</hi> Jesus <hi>was truly the Son of GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All were astonished to see the most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Persecutor</hi> of the <hi>Christians,</hi> become the most zealous <hi>Preacher</hi> of the <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Damascus,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> every day confounded, could not patiently suffer this change, and therefore they made several attempts on his <hi>Life.</hi> But the <hi>Disciples</hi> adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised of it, let him down in the Night by a <hi>Cord</hi> from the <hi>Walls,</hi> whose <hi>Gates</hi> were shut that he might not escape.</p>
                  <p>Being come to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he endeavoured to join himself to the rest of the <hi>Disciples.</hi> But when every one was afraid of him, as not knowing his Conversion; <hi>Barnabas</hi> took him, led him to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and related to them whatever had happened to him in the <hi>Way,</hi> and what he had done at <hi>Damascus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was then at length received as a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and having found at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (by reason of his <hi>Zeal</hi>) the same peril as at <hi>Damascus,</hi> he was constrained to retire to <hi>Tarsus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Conversion of S.</hi> Paul, <hi>which was heretofore the Joy of the</hi> Church, <hi>is now its Consolation; which makes her hope,</hi> GOD <hi>will bring into her</hi> Fold <hi>those, that heretofore persecuted her with the greatest Violence. For this Example teaches us, not to despair of any one.</hi> S. Paul <hi>says himself, That GOD has chosen him, to certifie all the World of this</hi> Truth, <hi>and to shew the riches of his</hi> Mercies, <hi>even to the worst of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It has been the Wish of the</hi> Fathers, <hi>to lie continually like S.</hi> Paul <hi>in a state of</hi> abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>before GOD, and to say to him from the same disposition of</hi> Soul <hi>these words, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a true Conversion: LORD,</hi> what wilt thou have me to do?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cornelius</hi> sent immediately hereupon some of his People to <hi>Joppa,</hi> and told them what he had seen. When these Persons drew near to the <hi>Town,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> Praying, about <hi>Noon</hi> fell into an Extasie, wherein he saw <hi>Heaven</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, whence came down a great <hi>Sheet,</hi> fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the four Corners, which was full of all sorts of <hi>Four-footed Beasts,</hi> and <hi>Feathered Fowls;</hi> and a Voice said, <hi>Peter, Kill and eat.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> at first excused himself, and said, He had never eaten any <hi>unclean Meats:</hi> But he was answered, That he must not call that <hi>unclean</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> had purified.</p>
                  <p>Whilst S. <hi>Peter</hi> was musing what this <hi>Vision</hi> might mean, which appeared at three different times, <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Servants entred into the <hi>House,</hi> who told him, That their <hi>Master</hi> had sent them, to entreat him to come and visit him.

                  <p>This modest Answer stopt these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and became since to all the <hi>Church</hi> an admirable Example for its <hi>Pastors;</hi> which shews them, That they lose nothing of their <hi>Authority,</hi> when their <hi>Charity</hi> leads them to use Condescension and Moderation towards the <hi>People</hi> under their Charge.</p>

                  <p>The whole <hi>Church</hi> interessing it self in the Death of so great an <hi>Apostle,</hi> drove on without intermission its Prayers and Cries unto <hi>GOD,</hi> who favourably heard them: For the <hi>Night</hi> before the <hi>Day</hi> that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was to be Executed, an <hi>Angel</hi> filled on a sudden the whole <hi>Dungeon</hi> with great Light, where this <hi>Apostle</hi> lay sleeping between two <hi>Souldiers</hi> bound.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Angel</hi> struck him, and awakening him, said, <hi>Make haste and rise;</hi> when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the <hi>Chains</hi> wherewith he was fastened, dropt off his <hi>Hands;</hi> and the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> said unto him, <hi>Gird thy self, and bind on thy</hi> Sandals, <hi>cast thy</hi> Garment <hi>about thee, and follow me; and he did as the</hi> Angel <hi>had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, and followed him without knowing what he did, thinking he was in a</hi> Dream, <hi>or thought he saw a</hi> Vision: <hi>When they were past the first, and the second</hi> Ward, <hi>or</hi> Watch, <hi>they came to the</hi> Iron-Gate, <hi>which leads to the</hi> City <hi>which opened to them of its own accord; and they went out, and passed on through one</hi> Street, <hi>and then the</hi> Angel <hi>vanished from him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then did S. <hi>Peter</hi> come to himself, and knew that <hi>GOD</hi> had sent his <hi>Angel</hi> to deliver him from the hand of <hi>Herod.</hi> He went thereupon immediately to the House of S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s <hi>Mother,</hi> where there were many of the <hi>Faithful</hi> assembled, who spent the Night in <hi>Prayers.</hi>

                  <p>When he had knock'd at the <hi>Door,</hi> a young Damsel named <hi>Rhodias,</hi> who knew S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Voice, instead of opening, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the <hi>Door</hi> to him, ran back, to tell those that were in the House the joyful News of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s deliverance. Some said, she was beside her self; others said, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps 'twas his <hi>Angel:</hi> But this <hi>holy Apostle</hi> continuing still to knock, they were strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surprized at the opening of the <hi>Door.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> made signs to them to be still and told them how the <hi>Angel</hi> had delivered him from Prison; and having enjoyned them to give notice thereof to S. <hi>James,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> he immediately departed from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to retire into another place.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Saint <hi>PAUL</hi> Cured a Lame Man, and obstructed the People that would Sacrifice to him as to a God.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter the miraculous Deliverance of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the History of the <hi>Acts</hi> scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaks any more of him, being wholly employed in relating the Actions of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Year</hi> 43.</note> This <hi>Holy Apostle</hi> having carried to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> the Charity of <hi>Antioch,</hi> with which he had been entrusted, was chosen with S. <hi>Barnabas</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to enlighten all the Provinces of <hi>Asia,</hi> and propagate the <hi>Faith</hi> throughout all <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He shewed in <hi>Paphos</hi> his Zeal against a false <hi>Prophet,</hi> who hindred the Proconsul <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> from believing in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> For this <hi>Holy Apostle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being full of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> beheld this <hi>Impostor,</hi> and said to him with an <hi>Apostolical Liberty: O thou full of all craft and subtilty, Child of the Devil, and enemy to all Righteousness, how long wilt thou pervert the ways of the</hi> LORD, <hi>which are strait? The hand of</hi> GOD <hi>is upon thee, and thou shalt become blind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had no sooner said these words, but this <hi>Seducer</hi> was struck with <hi>Blindness;</hi> and he sought some body to give him their hands. Thus did he shew in his Person the folly of those, who instead of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to <hi>GOD</hi> in the Evils he sends upon them, search only humane Remedies.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proconsul</hi> admired this Miracle, and believed in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> with a profound ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of his Doctrine, and to shew, that 'tis the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> who affects the Heart, and that all outward applications are of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle efficacy, unless seconded by the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of his <hi>Grace;</hi> the blindness which the <hi>Magician</hi> experienced in his Person, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him not, whereas the only sight of this Prodigy converted the <hi>Proconsul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some think that 'tis of this <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> (called before <hi>Saul</hi>) has taken the name of <hi>Paul,</hi> which is ever given him since this <hi>Conversion,</hi> in the Book of the <hi>Acts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> Preaching afterwards at <hi>Antioch,</hi> ended his <hi>Preachings</hi> by dreadful Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Anger of <hi>GOD,</hi> and shaked off against that <hi>People</hi> the Dust of his Feet. The <hi>Jews</hi> revenged themselves of these just Remonstrances in the City of <hi>Iconia,</hi> whose Inhabitants they so greatly animated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that they threw Stones at this <hi>holy Apostle,</hi> who was thereby obliged to withdraw to <hi>Lystra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was in this Town he found a <hi>Man Lame</hi> from his Birth, and observing he heard him speak with great <hi>Attention,</hi> he spake to him aloud, That he should arise and stand on his Feet, which immediately he did.</p>
                  <p>The People affected with this <hi>Miracle,</hi> would needs Sacrifice to S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> whom they respected as <hi>GODS</hi> descended from Heaven, and took on them the form of <hi>Men.</hi> But these humble <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> rent their <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and represented to these People, That they were only <hi>Men</hi> like unto them, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to give over Worshipping <hi>Idols,</hi> and adore the only true <hi>GOD,</hi> that made <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> came immediately hereupon into the Town of <hi>Lystra,</hi> and there stirred up the People, who changing according to their usual lightness, the <hi>Divine Honours</hi> which they would give S. <hi>Paul,</hi> into an excess of <hi>Fury;</hi> for they drove him out of the <hi>Town,</hi> stoned him and left him half dead. Then was seen the strange effects of <hi>Charity</hi> in a <hi>Soul</hi> when 'tis mounted to its highest degree. For S. <hi>Paul,</hi> tho' covered with <hi>Wounds,</hi> and black with <hi>Strokes,</hi> yet at that very hour betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Preaching</hi> afresh, and to declare to the <hi>Faithful</hi> more by these bloody Marks, than by his Words, <hi>That we must through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Tribulations <hi>enter into the Kingdom of</hi> GOD.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Gregory</hi> admires the great Courage of this <hi>Apostle; They stone him,</hi> says he, <hi>and yet he leaves not off to</hi> Preach; <hi>They may kill his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>The Year</hi> 46.</note> the <hi>Jews</hi> were not long before they made him feel the effects of their <hi>Hatred.</hi> They seized on him in a great Tumult, which they made, and the <hi>Tribune</hi> being come to appease it, snatched S. <hi>Paul</hi> out of the hands of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Altho' this <hi>Holy Apostle</hi> was batter'd with <hi>strokes,</hi> yet this hindred him not from desiring leave of the <hi>Tribune</hi> to speak to the People. But when he gave a publick account of all his Conduct, the <hi>Jews</hi> being encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his affirming, that he had a Call from <hi>GOD</hi> to Preach the <hi>Faith</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they cried out aloud, That such a Fellow was not worthy to live. And as the Tribune was ready to torment him, S. <hi>Paul</hi> demanded, Whether 'twas lawful to Scourge a <hi>Roman?</hi> and they immediately gave over misusing him.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning the <hi>Tribune</hi> brought him before the Assembly of <hi>Priests,</hi> to know what they thought of him Then S. <hi>Paul</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying himself with great freedom of Speech, <hi>Ananias</hi> the <hi>High Priest</hi> caused to be given him a <hi>Box</hi> on the <hi>Ear;</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> told this <hi>Judge,</hi> That <hi>GOD</hi> would one day strike him in like manner. In fine, He escaped the ill Designs of this <hi>Assembly,</hi> by saying, That all his Crime was, that he believed the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> which immediately cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a division amongst the <hi>Judges.</hi> A while after forty of the greatest <hi>Zealots</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> made a Vow, neither to <hi>eat</hi> nor <hi>drink</hi> until they had kill'd him. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was informed of this Conspiracy by his <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,</hi> and advertised the <hi>Tribune</hi> thereof, who made S. <hi>Paul</hi> to depart from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with a good Convoy, conducting him to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> to put him in the hands of <hi>Felix.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> fully justified himself before this <hi>Governour,</hi> who knowing his Innocency kept him in <hi>Prison,</hi> only because he expected <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> to be given him for his liberty.

And when it came, this <hi>Holy Apostle</hi> comforted them, assuring them, that not one of them should be lost. 'Twas known in effect, that the <hi>Revelation</hi> he had was true; for the <hi>Vessel</hi> being batter'd to pieces, they all got to shoar the best they could at the Isle of <hi>Malta,</hi> whose Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants received them with no small kindness. They immediately kindled a <hi>Fire</hi> to dry them, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> having taken up some of the Fewel, was bit by a <hi>Viper,</hi> which made these barbarous People think that he was a <hi>wicked Man,</hi> seeing the Wrath of <hi>GOD</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him both by <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land:</hi> But when they saw S. <hi>Paul</hi> shake off the <hi>Viper</hi> into the Fire without receiving harm, they soon changed their minds, and believed he was a <hi>GOD.</hi> He healed in this Isle the Father of <hi>Publius,</hi> the Governour thereof, with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others. In fine, having stayed there three Months, he departed thence, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at length at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he assembled immediately the principal Persons amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> and gave them an account why he had appealed to <hi>Caesar.</hi> He endeavoured to bring them over to the Faith of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> but found them little disposed thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Acts</hi> end here, and inform us of no more, saving that S. <hi>Paul</hi> dwelt two years at <hi>Rome</hi> in an House which he hired, and where he <hi>Preached</hi> the <hi>Faith</hi> to all those that would come and hear it.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> amongst all the rest of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> has had this <hi>Holy Apostle</hi> in greatest Reverence. <hi>His</hi> Life <hi>was his admiration, his</hi> Labours <hi>the mitigations of his</hi> Sufferings; <hi>and he told his</hi> People, <hi>that he would rather choose to be in Chains with S.</hi> Paul, <hi>than to be in Glory with the</hi> Angels <hi>in</hi> Heaven.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Seven Golden Candlesticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Revelations of S. <hi>John</hi> in the Apocalyps. How Jesus Christ shewed himself unto him.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ALtho' that the <hi>Revelations</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> made to S. <hi>John</hi> are all Mysterious, and very obscure in themselves, yet the <hi>Saints</hi> have found them to contain most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Instructions; as oft as they <hi>Read</hi> them with an humble frame of <hi>Soul,</hi> without prying too curiously into the <hi>depths</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>The first <hi>Vision</hi> which this <hi>Holy Apostle</hi> had in the Isle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> wherein he had been exiled, was, that being ravished in Spirit one <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day,</hi> he heard behind him a Noise like the sound of a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to write what he saw. And he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held seven <hi>Golden Candlesticks,</hi> and in the midst of them one like the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> cloathed with a long <hi>Robe,</hi> and girded with a <hi>Golden Girdle;</hi> his <hi>Hair</hi> was white as <hi>Snow,</hi> his <hi>Eyes</hi> sparkling like <hi>Fire,</hi> his <hi>Feet</hi> shining like the purest <hi>Brass,</hi> and his <hi>Voice</hi> was as the Noise of the great <hi>Waters.</hi> He had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Stars</hi> in his <hi>Hand;</hi> there came out of his <hi>Mouth</hi> a sharp <hi>Sword,</hi> and his <hi>Countenance</hi> was like the <hi>Sun</hi> at Noon-day.</p>
                  <p>As soon as ever S. <hi>John</hi> beheld him, he fell at his <hi>Feet</hi> as one dead; but he raised him up, telling him, that the seven <hi>Stars</hi> which he held in his <hi>Hand,</hi> where the seven <hi>Angels,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches.</hi> He commanded him to write what he saw, and to tell this in particular to these seven <hi>Bishops:</hi> To that of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> That he commmended him for his <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> against wicked Livers, and for his <hi>Patience</hi> in Adversity; but yet blamed him for having abated of his first <hi>Zeal;</hi> and admonished him, to remember whence he was fallen, and to Repent.</p>
                  <p>To him of <hi>Smyrna;</hi> He should comfort himself, seeing he was <hi>Rich</hi> in his <hi>Poverty,</hi> and unreproveable in the midst of all the <hi>Calumnies</hi> published against him: That he should arm himself against fresh <hi>Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which were ready to fall upon him, and to continue <hi>faithful</hi> to death.</p>
                  <p>To him of <hi>Pergamus;</hi> That he praised him for his <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> but he did not vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously enough oppose Errors; that he should therefore <hi>repent</hi> of this and take new Courage.</p>
                  <p>To the Bishop of <hi>Thyatira;</hi> That he knew his <hi>Charity</hi> to the Poor, his Constancy in <hi>Persecutions,</hi> and his uninterrupted <hi>Piety;</hi> but that he blamed his want of Courage, whereby he suffered a false <hi>Prophetess</hi> to seduce the Faithful.</p>
                  <p>To him of <hi>Sardis;</hi> That he was as dead in the sight of <hi>GOD,</hi> altho' believed to be alive, and that his Works were imperfect; that he must repent, and remember what he had <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>received,</hi> otherwise he would come upon him, and surprize him like a <hi>Thief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To him of <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> That he loved him for his <hi>Fidelity,</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> in Sufferings, altho' otherwise he had not much Strength.</p>
                  <p>In fine, to him of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> That he could not suffer his <hi>Lukewarmness,</hi> and would therefore Spue him out of his Mouth: That he thought himself <hi>rich,</hi> though he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>poor, blind</hi> and <hi>naked:</hi> That he should therefore purchase <hi>Gold</hi> purified by <hi>Fire</hi> to enrich himself, and <hi>Garments</hi> white as Snow to cover his <hi>Nakedness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Judgments</hi> which our <hi>LORD,</hi> when Risen, made in <hi>Heaven</hi> of those who serve him on <hi>Earth,</hi> have fill'd the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> with astonishment, S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> (amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) seemed to be much startled at them. He recites, says he, all the good which these <hi>Bishops</hi> have done, and yet declares to them, he will not pardon the <hi>Ill</hi> which they have done, till they have throughly repented of it. He strictly observes what progress every one makes in <hi>Vertue;</hi> and how he draws back from his first <hi>fervour.</hi> He marks out one single <hi>default</hi> amongst many great <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> and represents them as soil'd by this mixture. One only Omission, and one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly want of Vigour in a just occasion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends him, and makes him threaten Persons otherwise vertuous, to remove their <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick,</hi> and give away their <hi>Crown</hi> to others.</p>
                  <p>In fine, says this <hi>Holy Prelate,</hi> our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> shews us by this divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> what great Reasons the most <hi>just</hi> have for <hi>Humiliation;</hi> for should he shew them the bottom of their <hi>Hearts,</hi> they would find such <hi>stains,</hi> as would make them have a low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem for whatever appears commendable in them, and would fill them with an holy <hi>Indignation</hi> against themselves.</p>

                     <hi>which the</hi> Church <hi>has since made use of;</hi> Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almightly, which was, and is, and is to come. <hi>When the</hi> 4 Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals <hi>sang this</hi> Song, <hi>the</hi> 24 Elders <hi>fell down before him that sat on the</hi> Throne, <hi>and cast down their</hi> Crowns <hi>at his</hi> Feet, <hi>saying, Thou art worthy,</hi> O Lord, to receive Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Power; for thou hast created all things, and 'tis thro' thee they do subsist.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>John</hi> saw afterwards in the right Hand of him that sat on the <hi>Throne,</hi> a <hi>Book,</hi> but sealed with 7 <hi>Seals,</hi> and an <hi>Angel</hi> cried with a loud voice, <hi>Who is worthy to open the Book, and to break the Seals thereof?</hi> but no one could open it, or look upon it.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>John</hi> was so troubled at this, that he shed Tears, when one of the <hi>Elders</hi> bid him cease Weeping, because the <hi>Lion</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> had obtained by virtue of his <hi>Death</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to open this, and to break open the <hi>Seals</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>He beheld at the same time in the midst of the <hi>Throne</hi> of the 4 <hi>Animals,</hi> and the 24 <hi>Elders,</hi> the <hi>Lamb</hi> which lay slain, and had 7 <hi>Eyes,</hi> and 7 <hi>Horns.</hi> The <hi>Lamb</hi> took after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Book</hi> out of the right Hand of him who sat on the <hi>Throne,</hi> and immediately the 4 <hi>Animals,</hi> together with the 24 <hi>Elders</hi> fell down before the <hi>Lamb,</hi> having each of them <hi>Harps,</hi> and golden <hi>Cups</hi> full of <hi>Incense</hi> and <hi>Perfumes, which are the Prayers of the Saints.</hi> They said to the <hi>Lamb</hi> in their <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, Thou Lord art worthy to take the Boo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>At the same time an infinite Company of <hi>Angels</hi> joyned in this <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Praise,</hi> and said, <hi>To him that sits on the Throne, and to the Lamb, be Honour and Glory World without end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These blest <hi>Spirits,</hi> who remember in the midst of their Joy, that their happiness comes only from <hi>GOD,</hi> are too humble to attribute their Victories to themselves; and therefore they give <hi>GOD</hi> the glory of them, as the only <hi>Author,</hi> from whence all good things do flow.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> have admired in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Adoration, which they render to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> denoted by the <hi>Lamb,</hi> that one of the chief subjects of their Praises is, the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Book</hi> and breaking open the <hi>Seals;</hi> which is to say, that he has opened to us the sense of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> by his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Resurrection.</hi> We had this <hi>Book</hi> before, but it was sealed, and we had it, as not having of it. Now that the Mysteries are unveil'd, 'tis very reasonable we should adore him, who has given us this <hi>Light,</hi> and that we continually nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish our <hi>Souls</hi> with the words of <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> have admired in these Mysterious <hi>Visions</hi> the excellency of this Divine Book, wherein they are represented.

                  <p>This is that which made S. <hi>Denys</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> say, according to the relation of <hi>Eusebius, I am perswaded that the Book of the</hi> Revelations <hi>is as admirable, as 'tis little known: For altho I do not understand the words of it, yet I know they contain great sense under their obscurity and profoundness. I make not my self the</hi> Judge <hi>of these Truths, neither do I measure them by the smallness of my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; but giving more to</hi> Faith <hi>than</hi> Reason, <hi>I believe them so much raised above me, that 'tis not possible for me to attain unto them; so that I esteem them not the less, when I do not comprehend them, but I reverence them so much the more; in that I do not comprehend them.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Angel</hi> afterwards took the <hi>Censer,</hi> and filled it with <hi>Fire</hi> from the <hi>Altar,</hi> and having cast it on the <hi>Earth,</hi> there was heard a noise in the <hi>Air</hi> of <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</hi>

And the first <hi>Wo</hi> being past, the sixth <hi>Angel</hi> sounded his <hi>Trumpet;</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> heard a Voice from the four Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or Horns of the <hi>Golden Altar,</hi> which is before <hi>GOD,</hi> saying to the sixth <hi>Angel</hi> which had the <hi>Trumpet,</hi> Loose the four <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> which are bound in the great River <hi>Euphrates.</hi> And he unbound those four <hi>Angels,</hi> who were prepared for an <hi>hour,</hi> a <hi>day,</hi> a <hi>month,</hi> and a <hi>year,</hi> to slay the third part of Men. And the number of the Army of <hi>Horsemen</hi> were Two hundred thousand thousand.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>John</hi> saw also <hi>Horses</hi> in the Vision, and them that sat thereon had <hi>Breast plates</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> and of <hi>Jacinth</hi> and <hi>Brimstone;</hi> and the Heads of the <hi>Horses</hi> were as those of <hi>Lions,</hi> and there came <hi>Fire, Smoke</hi> and <hi>Brimstone</hi> out of their <hi>Mouths.</hi> And with these three things, the third part of Men were killed.</p>
                  <p>The strength of these <hi>Horses</hi> were in their <hi>Mouths,</hi> and in their <hi>Tails,</hi> which were like unto those of <hi>Serpents,</hi> and had <hi>Heads,</hi> and with them they did great Mischief.</p>
                  <p>And the rest of the <hi>Men</hi> which were not killed by these <hi>Plagues,</hi> yet repented not of the works of their <hi>Hands,</hi> that they should not worship <hi>Devils,</hi> and <hi>Idols</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> and <hi>Brass</hi> and <hi>Stone,</hi> and of <hi>Wood,</hi> which neither can <hi>see,</hi> nor <hi>hear,</hi> nor <hi>Walk;</hi> neither repent they of their <hi>Murthers,</hi> nor of their <hi>Sorceries,</hi> nor of their <hi>Fornication,</hi> nor of their <hi>Thefts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Gregory</hi> says, That this fifth and sixth <hi>Plague</hi> denote these Men which persecute the <hi>Saints.</hi> The first are like to <hi>Locusts,</hi> which sting with their <hi>Tails;</hi> And such, saith this <hi>Father,</hi> are those that poyson Men with <hi>Flatteries,</hi> and who smiling in their <hi>Faces</hi> kill them with their <hi>Tails,</hi> who under a pretence of <hi>Friendship,</hi> seek only an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to destroy them.</p>
                  <p>The sixth <hi>Plague</hi> of the <hi>Horses,</hi> which hurt with their <hi>Mouths</hi> and <hi>Tails,</hi> denotes according to the same <hi>Father,</hi> those who use their <hi>Tongues</hi> to corrupt the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and Truths of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and who doing mischief thus with their <hi>Mouths,</hi> do moreover en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, says this <hi>Holy Father</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief with their <hi>Tails,</hi> in relying like the <hi>Arians</hi> heretofore, on the Power of Great Men, that uphold them; whereby, though they are contemptible of themselves, yet by these Props they render themselves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to the <hi>Church.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And he cryed with a loud <hi>Voice,</hi> like as when a <hi>Lion</hi> roareth; and when he had thus cryed, seven <hi>Thunders</hi> uttered their <hi>Voices;</hi> And when the seven <hi>Thunders</hi> had uttered their <hi>Voices,</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> was about to write their <hi>Words;</hi> but he heard a <hi>Voice</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> which said unto him, seal up those things which the seven <hi>Thunders</hi> uttered, and write them not. Then the <hi>Angel</hi> which S. <hi>John</hi> saw stand upon the <hi>Sea,</hi> and upon the <hi>Earth;</hi> lifted up his Hand to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the things that therein are, and the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the things that therein are and the <hi>Sea,</hi> and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer: But in the Days of the <hi>Voice</hi> of the seventh <hi>Angel,</hi> when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of <hi>GOD</hi> should be finish'd; as he hath declared to his <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Voice</hi> which S. <hi>John</hi> heard from <hi>Heaven,</hi> directed it self again to him, saying, <hi>Go and take the little Book, which is open in the Hand of the</hi> Angel, <hi>which standeth on the</hi> Sea <hi>and the</hi> Earth. And he went to the <hi>Angel</hi> and said, <hi>Give me the little Book.</hi> And the <hi>Angel</hi> said, Take it, and eat it, and it shall make thy <hi>Belly</hi> bitter, but it shall be in thy <hi>Mouth</hi> as sweet as <hi>Honey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>John</hi> took the little <hi>Book</hi> out of the <hi>Angels</hi> Hands, and eat it; and found in effect, that it was in his <hi>Mouth</hi> sweet as <hi>Honey;</hi> but having swallowed it down, it proved bitter in his <hi>Belly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Angel</hi> said unto him, Thou must <hi>Prophesie</hi> again before many <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> and <hi>Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Book,</hi> according to the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> and especially S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> is the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> which is the true <hi>Food</hi> of our <hi>Souls.</hi> We cannot digest it of our selves, says this <hi>Father, GOD</hi> must give us his assistance, as he gives it here to S. <hi>John,</hi> and elsewhere to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We devour this <hi>Book,</hi> says he, when <hi>GOD</hi> discovers to us the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of it; and this understanding which he gives us of it, is sweet to our tast as <hi>Honey.</hi> But at the same time, this <hi>Book</hi> which is so sweet in the <hi>Mouth,</hi> becomes bitter in the <hi>Stomach;</hi> which denotes, That weak and carnal <hi>Minds</hi> cannot relish the <hi>Truths,</hi> which are the delicacies of the <hi>Just.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Figure</hi> further signifies, according to S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> that when the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> begins to become sweet in our <hi>Mouths,</hi> and we begin to find our pleasures in it, our <hi>Stomach,</hi> or <hi>Belly,</hi> which is to say, the bottom of our <hi>Hearts,</hi> whose defects this <hi>Word</hi> discovers to us, is filled with bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; because that the more we know <hi>GOD,</hi> the more we know and understand our selves, and bewail the Misery rooted in us, altho' before we did not perceive it; that we may often say to him, with the <hi>Royal Prophet: Lord, All my desires are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, and the sighings of my Heart are not hid from thee.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter that S. <hi>John</hi> had taken the <hi>Book</hi> out of the hand of him which presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to him, there was a <hi>Reed</hi> given him like unto a <hi>Rod,</hi> with which he was ordered to go and measure the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the <hi>Altar,</hi> and them that worship therein.</p>
                  <p>But he was not to measure the outward <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> because it was given unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were to tread the <hi>Holy City</hi> under foot forty and two <hi>Months.</hi> And I will give power, said <hi>GOD,</hi> to my two <hi>Witnesses,</hi> who shall Prophecy a thousand two hundred and threescore Days, cloathed in <hi>Sackcloath.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>And having finished their Testimony, the <hi>Beast</hi> which ascends out of the <hi>Bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Pit,</hi> shall make <hi>War</hi> against them, and vanquish and kill them.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Bodies</hi> shall lie in the <hi>Streets</hi> of the great <hi>City,</hi> which Spiritually is called <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where also our <hi>Lord</hi> was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and <hi>Men</hi> of several <hi>Nations, Tribes</hi> and <hi>Languages,</hi> shall see their dead Bodies lying on the <hi>Earth</hi> for three Days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead Bodies to be put in <hi>Graves.</hi> The <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> shall rejoyce to see them in this condition make <hi>Feasts,</hi> and send <hi>Presents</hi> to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because these two <hi>Prophets</hi> much tormented those that dwelt on the <hi>Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As future things are already present, or rather past in the sight of <hi>GOD,</hi> so S. <hi>John,</hi> according to the custom of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing related the beginning of this <hi>History</hi> as a thing to come, continues it as if 'twere alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy past. And after three Days and an half, adds he, the Spirit of <hi>Life</hi> from <hi>GOD</hi> entred into them, and they stood upon their <hi>Feet,</hi> and great fear fell upon them that saw them. And they heard a great <hi>Voice</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> saying unto them, <hi>Come up hither:</hi> And they ascended up to <hi>Heaven</hi> in a <hi>Cloud,</hi> in the sight of their <hi>Enemies.</hi> And at the same time there was a great <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and the Tenth part of the <hi>City</hi> fell, and Seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men were kill'd by this <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and the Remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the <hi>GOD</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>SAint <hi>John</hi> saw a <hi>Beast</hi> rise out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> that had seven <hi>Heads</hi> and ten <hi>Horns,</hi> and on his <hi>Horns</hi> ten <hi>Crowns,</hi> and on his <hi>Heads</hi> the name of <hi>Blasphemy.</hi> She was like to a <hi>Leopard,</hi> and her <hi>Feet</hi> were as the <hi>Feet</hi> of a <hi>Bear,</hi> her <hi>Mouth</hi> of a <hi>Lion,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> gave her great power, and his seat, and great Authority.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>John</hi> saw one of these seven <hi>Heads,</hi> as it were wounded to death; but this mortal Wound was healed, and all the World wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred after the <hi>Beast.</hi> And they worshipped the <hi>Dragon,</hi> which gave power to the <hi>Beast,</hi> and they worshiped the <hi>Beast</hi> saying, who is like to this <hi>Beast</hi>? Who is able to make War with him? And there was given to him a <hi>Mouth</hi> speaking great things, and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against <hi>GOD,</hi> his <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and them that dwell in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him to continue 42 <hi>Months.</hi> There was also power given him to make <hi>War</hi> with the <hi>Saints,</hi> to vanquish them, and power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him over all <hi>Kindreds, Tongues</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> to vanquish them whose Names are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of <hi>Life,</hi> of the <hi>Lamb</hi> slain from the foundation of the <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>John</hi> saw afterwards another <hi>Beast</hi> which came out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and he had two <hi>Horns</hi> like a <hi>Lamb,</hi> yet he spake as a <hi>Dragon,</hi> and he exerciseth all the power of the first <hi>Beast,</hi> before him, and causeth the <hi>Earth,</hi> and them that dwell therein, to worship the first <hi>Beast</hi> whose deadly Wound was healed; and he doth great Wonders, so that he maketh Fire come down from <hi>Heaven</hi> on the <hi>Earth</hi> in the sight of Men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the <hi>Earth,</hi> by means of those <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> which he had power to do in the sight of the <hi>Beast,</hi> saying, to them that dwell on the <hi>Earth,</hi> that they should make an Image to the <hi>Beast,</hi> which had the wound by a <hi>Sword,</hi> and did live.</p>
                  <p>And she had power to give life to the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> that the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> should both speak, and cause as many as would not worship the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> to be killed. And he causeth all, both <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>poor, small</hi> and <hi>great, bond</hi> and <hi>free</hi> to receive a mark in their right <hi>Hand,</hi> or in their <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</hi> Neither was any man to buy or sell, save he that had the Mark, or Name of the <hi>Beast,</hi> or the Number of his <hi>Name.</hi> But at the same time S. <hi>John</hi> saw the <hi>Lamb</hi> standing on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and with him an hundred forty four thousand, having his <hi>Fathers</hi> Name written in their <hi>Foreheads:</hi> And a Voice said, that in their <hi>Mouth</hi> was found no guile, for they are without fault before the Throne of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another cried at the same time, That if any one worshipped the <hi>Beast,</hi> and his <hi>Image,</hi> and received his Mark on his <hi>Forehead,</hi> and in his <hi>Hand,</hi> he should drink of the <hi>Wine</hi> of the Wrath of <hi>GOD,</hi> which is poured out without mixture, and be tormented with <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimstone,</hi> the Smoke of whose tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ascendeth up for ever and ever, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no rest Day nor Night, who worship the <hi>Beast,</hi> or his <hi>Image,</hi> and receive the mark of his Name.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Gregory</hi> enlargeth himself much on these mysterious <hi>Beasts,</hi> and this last above all made him tremble. He was like unto a <hi>Lamb,</hi> said S. <hi>John,</hi> but he spake like a <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> which admirably well denotes, says this <hi>Holy Father,</hi> the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Seducers</hi> which are in the Church.

                  <p>We should pray <hi>GOD</hi> to preserve us, lest we be of the number of those mentioned by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who shall be delivered by the just Judgment of <hi>GOD</hi> unto the power of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the malignity of Error, because they would not receive the Truth but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it as an <hi>Enemy;</hi> whereas they ought to love it, as the remedy of all their Miseries, and the true life of their <hi>Souls.</hi>

                  <p>SAint <hi>John</hi> saw another Wonder in <hi>Heaven.</hi> He saw seven <hi>Angels,</hi> having the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven last <hi>Plagues;</hi> which contained the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Wrath:</hi> And a Voice at the same time said to the seven <hi>Angels,</hi> go and pour out on the <hi>Earth</hi> the seven <hi>Vials</hi> of the Wrath of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the first went and poured out his <hi>Vial</hi> on the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the Men which had the Mark of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and adored his <hi>Image,</hi> were struck with a noysom and grievous <hi>Sore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the second <hi>Angel</hi> poured out his <hi>Vial</hi> on the <hi>Sea,</hi> and 'twas changed into <hi>Blood,</hi> and all the living Creatures died therein.</p>
                  <p>The third <hi>Angel</hi> poured out his <hi>Vial</hi> on the <hi>Rivers,</hi> and <hi>Fountains</hi> of <hi>Waters,</hi> and they were changed into <hi>Blood,</hi> and an <hi>Angel</hi> said at the same time, <hi>Thou art Righteous, O Lord, for they have spilt the Blood of the</hi> Saints, <hi>and</hi> Prophets, <hi>and thou hast given them</hi> Blood <hi>to drink.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth <hi>Angel</hi> poured out his <hi>Vial</hi> on the <hi>Sun</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Power was given him to scorch <hi>Men</hi> with <hi>Fire,</hi> which made them Blaspheme <hi>GOD,</hi> and not repent.</p>
                  <p>The fifth <hi>Angel</hi> poured out his <hi>Vial</hi> on the Throne of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and his Kingdom became dark, and <hi>Men</hi> gnawed their <hi>Tongues</hi> for pain.</p>
                  <p>The sixth <hi>Angel</hi> poured out his <hi>Vial</hi> on the great River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and its Water was dried up to make way for the <hi>Kings</hi> which were to come from the <hi>East.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then S. <hi>John</hi> saw three unclean Spirits like <hi>Frogs,</hi> come out of the Mouth of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and out of the Mouth of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and out of the Mouth of the false <hi>Prophet;</hi> for they are the Spirits of <hi>Devils,</hi> working <hi>Miracles,</hi> which go forth unto the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the whole World to gather them to the Battle of that great Day of <hi>GOD Almighty,</hi> and they gathered them all in one place.</p>
                  <p>The seventh <hi>Angel</hi> poured out his <hi>Vial</hi> into the <hi>Air,</hi> and there came a great <hi>Voice</hi> out of the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> from the <hi>Throne,</hi> saying, <hi>It is done.</hi> And there were heard great <hi>Thundrings</hi> and <hi>Lightning:</hi> And the great <hi>City</hi> was divided into three parts, and the <hi>Cities</hi> of the <hi>Nations</hi> fell, and great <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> came in remembrance before <hi>GOD,</hi> to give unto her the Cup of the <hi>Wine</hi> of the fierceness of his <hi>Wrath.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>S. <hi>John</hi> saw this <hi>Woman</hi> drunk with the Blood of the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and he wondred with great admiration at the sight: But the <hi>Angel</hi> which shewed him these things, asked him, wherefore he was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd? and he explain'd to him the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of this <hi>Whore,</hi> and the <hi>Beast</hi> on which she sat.</p>

                  <p>SAint <hi>John</hi> saw (after these things) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Angel</hi> come down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> having great Power, and, the <hi>Earth</hi> was lightned with his Glory. And he cried with a loud Voice, saying, <hi>Babylon the great is fallen, she is fallen, and is become the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of</hi> Devils, <hi>the hold of every foul</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>and the Cage of every unclean and hateful</hi> Bird. <hi>For all</hi> Nations <hi>have drunk of the</hi> Wine <hi>of the Wrath of her</hi> Fornication, <hi>and the Kings of the</hi> Earth <hi>have committed</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication <hi>with her, and the</hi> Merchants <hi>of the</hi> Earth <hi>are waxed rich through the abundance of her</hi> Luxuries.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>John</hi> heard afterwards another Voice, which said, <hi>Come out of</hi> Babylon <hi>my People, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive none of her Plagues; for her sins have reached unto</hi> Heaven; <hi>and</hi> GOD <hi>hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred her Iniquities. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her, double according to her works;</hi> and in the <hi>Cup</hi> which she hath filled to you to drink, give to her double. How much she has glorified her self, and lived deliciously, so much <hi>torment</hi> and <hi>sorrow</hi> give her; for she saith in her heart, <hi>I am in the</hi> Throne <hi>as a</hi> Queen, <hi>I am no Widow, and shall see no sorrow.</hi> Therefore shall her Plagues come in one day, <hi>Death, Mourning,</hi> and <hi>Famine</hi> shall fall upon her, and she shall be utterly burnt with <hi>Fire.</hi> But the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> who have committed <hi>Fornication,</hi> and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the Smoke of her <hi>burning,</hi> and standing afar off for fear of her <hi>torments,</hi> say <hi>Alas alas! that great City,</hi> Babylon, <hi>that mighty City, thy Condemnation is come in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The <hi>Merchants</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> shall weep and mourn over her, for no Man buyeth their <hi>Merchandize</hi> there any more; <hi>viz.</hi> the Merchandize of <hi>Gold, Silver, Pearl, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, fine Linen and Purple, and Silk and Scarlet,</hi> and all <hi>sweet Wood,</hi> Vessels of <hi>Ivory,</hi> and all manner of <hi>Brass, Iron</hi> and <hi>Marble, Cinamon, Odours</hi> and <hi>Oyntments, Frankensence, Wine</hi> and <hi>Oyl,</hi> fine <hi>Flour</hi> and <hi>Wheat, Sheep</hi> and <hi>Horses, Chariots,</hi> and <hi>Slaves,</hi> and <hi>Souls of Men:</hi> The <hi>Fruits</hi> that thy <hi>Soul</hi> lusted after are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more. The <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> of these things which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for fear of her <hi>torment, weeping,</hi> and <hi>wailing</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and say <hi>Alas, alas</hi>! That great <hi>City</hi> that was cloathed in fine <hi>Linen, Purple</hi> and <hi>Scarlet,</hi> and <hi>Deckt</hi> with <hi>Silver, Gold</hi> and <hi>precious Stones,</hi> in one hour is come to nought. All <hi>Mariners,</hi> and all those that pass the <hi>Seas</hi> to Traffick, shall keep at a distance from her: They shall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the sight of her <hi>burning,</hi> saying, <hi>What City is like unto this great City?</hi> And they shall cast <hi>Dust</hi> on their Heads, saying, weeping, <hi>Alas, how has this great City been ruined in a moment!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then a great <hi>Angel</hi> took up a Stone like a great <hi>Mill-stone,</hi> and cast it into the <hi>Sea,</hi> saying, <hi>Thus with violence shall that great City</hi> Babylon <hi>be thrown down, and shall be found no more.</hi> And the Voice of <hi>Harpers</hi> and <hi>Musicians,</hi> and of <hi>Pipers</hi> and <hi>Trumpeters,</hi> shall be no more heard in thee, neither any <hi>Crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of whatever Craft he be; and the light of a <hi>Candle</hi> shall shine no more in thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall the Voice of the <hi>Bridegroom;</hi> nor the <hi>Bride</hi> be any more heard in this City. Thy <hi>Merchants</hi> were the great Men of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and by thy <hi>Sorceries</hi> were all Nations deceived. And in her was found the Blood of <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> and all that were slain upon the <hi>Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Lamentations at the loss of <hi>Babylon,</hi> have made the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> say, That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> bewailed <hi>Jerusalem</hi> when as then it subsisted, and that we ought also to bewail the Miseries of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when she appears in all her Glory. And therefore St. <hi>Austin</hi> considering the words of the <hi>Wicked</hi> in the Book of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> when they complain with a <hi>Repentance</hi> full of despair, that their <hi>Riches</hi> have left them in a moment, adds with great reason; <hi>Let us now say</hi> Brethren, <hi>by a foresight which will prove advantageous to us: Every thing passes like a shadow, lest we say when 'twill not avail us, like those aforementioned wicked Persons, with fruitless</hi> Tears <hi>and</hi> Lamentations; <hi>All is past as a shadow.</hi>

                  <p>AFter the Ruin of <hi>Babylon,</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> heard the Songs of the <hi>Saints,</hi> who adored <hi>GOD,</hi> because of his <hi>Judgments</hi> which he had exercised against this <hi>Whore.</hi> He saw afterwards <hi>Heaven</hi> opened, and therein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a <hi>white Horse,</hi> and he that rode there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was called the <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>True</hi> that judgeth and combateth justly.

                     <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>John</hi> also saw an <hi>Angel</hi> come from <hi>Heaven,</hi> having the <hi>Key</hi> of the <hi>Bottomless Pit</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a great <hi>Chain</hi> in his hand, and he laid hold on the <hi>Dragon</hi> that old <hi>Serpent,</hi> which is the <hi>Devil</hi> and bound him for 1000 years; and having cast him into the <hi>Bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Pit,</hi> shutting up, and setting a <hi>Seal</hi> upon him, that he should deceive the <hi>Nations</hi> no more till the 1000 years were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd, after which he was to be unbound for a little while.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards S. <hi>John</hi> saw <hi>Thrones,</hi> and they that sat upon them, and <hi>Judgment</hi> was given to them; and he saw the <hi>Souls</hi> of them that were <hi>Beheaded</hi> for the Testimony of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> and for the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and which had not worshipped the <hi>Beast,</hi> nor his <hi>Image,</hi> neither had received his Mark on their <hi>Fore-heads,</hi> or in their <hi>Hands,</hi> and they lived and reigned with <hi>Christ</hi> 1000 years; but the rest of the <hi>Dead</hi> lived not until the 1000 years were finish'd, and this is the first <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the accomplishment of these 1000 years, <hi>Satan</hi> shall be unbound, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his <hi>Prison,</hi> and go out to deceive <hi>Nations,</hi> which are at the four Corners of the <hi>World,</hi> to gather them to fight, and environ the <hi>Camp</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and the <hi>City</hi> beloved of <hi>GOD:</hi> But <hi>Fire</hi> came down from <hi>GOD</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and devoured them, and the <hi>Devil</hi> who seduced them, was cast into the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimstone,</hi> where the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>false Prophet</hi> shall be tormented Day and Night for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>John</hi> then saw a great <hi>white Throne,</hi> and the Majesty of him that sat thereon, from whose face the <hi>Earth</hi> and the <hi>Heaven</hi> fled away, and disappeared.</p>
                  <p>He saw the <hi>Dead</hi> small and great stand before <hi>GOD;</hi> and another <hi>Book</hi> was opened, which was the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>Dead</hi> were judged out of what was written in this <hi>Book,</hi> according to their Works. And the <hi>Sea, Death</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> gave up their <hi>Dead;</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> were cast into the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> with all those whose <hi>Names</hi> were not written in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us, <hi>That this</hi> Dragon <hi>which the</hi> Angel <hi>binds in the</hi> Bottomless Pit, <hi>is the</hi> Devil, <hi>whom</hi> GOD <hi>casts out from the Hearts of the Faithful, and keeps chained in the Hearts of the Wicked, who have ill designs against the Servants of</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>though they cannot execute them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> GOD <hi>gives afterwards</hi> (says this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father) <hi>power to this</hi> Dragon <hi>to come out of the</hi> Pit, <hi>when he permits for the good of the</hi> Saints, <hi>that the Malice of the Wicked should shew it self outwardly, and set upon the Good with open Violence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is hard to find a clear Explication of the other Circumstances which these Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations set before us. But this is certain, That they denote to us either the Power of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in his Glory, or the power of the <hi>Devil</hi> over the Wicked, or the Terror with which they shall appear before the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> or the severity with which this great <hi>

                  <p>Thus all these <hi>Instructions,</hi> whose very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity is edifying, should carry us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand with more respect, and to practise with greater care this so clear Advice of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the <hi>Gospel.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then an <hi>Angel</hi> transported S. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> on a high Mountain, and shewed him the <hi>Holy Jerusalem,</hi> which descended from <hi>Heaven;</hi> coming from GOD; being envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron'd with the Divine <hi>Brightness,</hi> having an high <hi>Wall,</hi> wherein were 12 <hi>Gates,</hi> and 12 <hi>Angels,</hi> one at each <hi>Gate,</hi> whereon were the Names written of the 12 <hi>Tribes</hi> of the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel:</hi> on the <hi>East</hi> three <hi>Gates,</hi> on the <hi>North</hi> three <hi>Gates,</hi> on the <hi>South</hi> three <hi>Gates,</hi> and on the <hi>West</hi> three <hi>Gates:</hi> And the <hi>Wall</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> had 12 Foundations, and in them the Names of the 12 <hi>Apostles</hi> of the <hi>Lamb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that spake to S. <hi>John</hi> had a <hi>Golden Reed</hi> to measure the <hi>City,</hi> the <hi>Gates,</hi> and the <hi>Walls.</hi> The <hi>City</hi> lieth four square, the length and breadth being equal, and he measured the <hi>City</hi> with the <hi>Reed,</hi> and found it 1200 <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs;</hi> and he measured the <hi>Wall,</hi> which is 144 <hi>Cubits,</hi> according to the measure of a Man, that is, of the <hi>Angel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Wall</hi> was built with <hi>Jasper,</hi> and the City was pure <hi>Gold,</hi> like unto clear <hi>Glass:</hi> The Foundations of the <hi>Walls</hi> were garnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all manner of <hi>precious Stones,</hi> and the 12 <hi>Gates</hi> were 12 <hi>Pearls;</hi> each of these <hi>Gates</hi> was made of one of these <hi>Pearls.</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> said, he saw no <hi>Temple</hi> therein, because the LORD GOD <hi>Almighty,</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> are the <hi>Temple</hi> of it. This <hi>Temple</hi> had no need of the <hi>Sun</hi> nor <hi>Moon</hi> to shine in it, for the Glory of GOD did enlighten it, and the <hi>Lamb</hi> is the light of it. And the <hi>Gates</hi> of it shall not be shut at all by Day, for there shall no Night be there. Nothing <hi>unclean</hi> shall enter there nor any of those who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Abominations,</hi> and speak <hi>Lyes;</hi> but those only who are written in the <hi>Lambs Book</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He saw also a pure <hi>River</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> clear as <hi>Crystal,</hi> proceeding out of the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> In the midst of the <hi>City,</hi> and of either side the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> was the <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> which bare 12 manner of <hi>Fruits,</hi> which yields its <hi>Fruit</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Month</hi> the <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> are to heal the <hi>Nations.</hi> And there shall be no more <hi>Curse,</hi> but the <hi>Throne</hi> of GOD and the <hi>Lamb</hi> shall be in it, and his <hi>Servants</hi> shall serve him; they shall see his <hi>Face,</hi> and his Name shall be writ on their <hi>Foreheads.</hi> Immediately after our <hi>Saviour</hi> said to S. <hi>John, I come quickly, and bring my recompence with me, to give to every one according to his Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blessed are those that wash their</hi> Garments <hi>in the Blood of the</hi> Lamb, <hi>that they may have right to the</hi> Tree <hi>of</hi> Life, <hi>and enter into the City by the</hi> Gates.</p>
                  <p>As the representation of the punishment of the <hi>Wicked</hi> is so dreadful and various in all this <hi>Book,</hi> so nothing is more consolatory than the description of this <hi>Heavenly Jerusalem</hi> and the everlasting recompence which GOD bestows on the Good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How precious ought the Labours of this Life to be to us,</hi> say the <hi>Holy Fathers, seeing they are as Gold, whereby we purchase this Glory, so great that it cannot be comprehended</hi>! The true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> have always sighed towards this <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jerusalem;</hi> and knowing that their <hi>Souls</hi> (according to the <hi>Scripture</hi>) are the <hi>living Stones</hi> of this sacred Building, they have been willing to have them cut, and as it were polish'd in this World with the Sheers of <hi>Affliction</hi> and <hi>Sufferings.</hi> They have ever had one Eye on this <hi>Bottomless Pit</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimstone,</hi> mentioned in the several places of this <hi>Book,</hi> and the other lifted up towards this everlasting <hi>City,</hi> where <hi>Men</hi> shall enjoy the same happiness which GOD does, often calling to mind these excellent words of S. <hi>Austin. Love the Good things which Christ promises you; fear the Evils wherewith he threatens you, and then you will slight as well the Promises as Threatnings of this World.</hi>

                     <p>After his being Elected to the <hi>Apostleship,</hi> he continued amongst the <hi>Apostles,</hi> till our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Ascension,</hi> and then for about eight Years Preached up and down in <hi>Judaea;</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards which way he steer'd his <hi>Travels,</hi> for the Conversion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known; but <hi>Aethiopia</hi> is the place most generally assign'd him for his <hi>Province,</hi> tho' some affirm, he went first into <hi>Parthia.</hi>

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his History of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> The first, said to be written at <hi>Achaia,</hi> when he was with <hi>Paul,</hi> who is thought by some to have bin a great assistance to him in it, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it has bin entituled S. <hi>Pauls Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi> and all this might seem probable enough, were it not that S. <hi>Luke</hi> himself expresly mentions, That whatsoever he writ in this <hi>Gospel,</hi> he had it from the Testimony of those, who from the beginning had been Eye-witnesses of all our <hi>Saviours Works</hi> and <hi>Transactions;</hi> and this as <hi>S. Austin</hi> says came to pass by the wise Counsel of GOD, that of the 4 <hi>Evangelists,</hi> 2 having bin <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> the remaining 2 should not be so, to the end it might not be believed there was any difference in their <hi>Writings,</hi> who saw the Actions of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and those that described them, from the Faithful Relation of those that had seen them; GOD designing in this manner to shew us, that the certitude of the <hi>Evangelical History,</hi> comes not only from those that made it, and relate the things which they have seen, which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in several <hi>Histories,</hi> whose certainty is only Human and Moral; but that it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the particular assistance of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> who dictated all their <hi>Words</hi> to the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> as well to S. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> who were <hi>Disciples</hi> to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as to S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> who were <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> was doubtless writ at <hi>Rome,</hi> at the time of his being there with <hi>Paul,</hi> in his first <hi>Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,</hi> and were both originally written in the <hi>Greek Tongue,</hi> as may be concluded from what S. <hi>Jerom</hi> and others observe in the Elegancy of the Style, and purity of the <hi>Greek</hi> above others of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that writ in that <hi>Language;</hi> and both these <hi>Works</hi> he dedicated to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> a Person of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Honour and Quality, and one of his principal <hi>Converts.</hi> He writ his <hi>Gospel</hi> about the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 56. In the beginning of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> he relates the Motive he had in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it saying, that several hastily undertook to write the <hi>Evangelical History,</hi> he thought himself obliged to do it after an exact infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, from those who had bin the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers and Ministers of it, and especially from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to hinder the word of the <hi>Gospel</hi> from being Sophisticated by the mixture of Error and Falshood.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Luke</hi> always remained in <hi>Coelibacy,</hi> and arrived to the age of 84 years. The <hi>Church</hi> says of him, that he continually bore on his Body the marks of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and therefore thought his <hi>Death</hi> was not honoured with suffering: Yet one may say, according to the expression of S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> That his life was a continual <hi>Martyrdom.</hi>

S. <hi>Luke</hi> therefore, the Penman of this <hi>Book,</hi> after a short Preface declares when and how <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> ascended into <hi>Heaven;</hi> and how <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> was chosen by <hi>Lot,</hi> to supply the place of the Traitor <hi>Judas,</hi> who hang'd himself, Chap.

Next relates how the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> came down upon the <hi>Apostles,</hi> in the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Cloven Tongues,</hi> like as of <hi>Fire,</hi> with the sound of a mighty rushing <hi>Wind,</hi> whereupon they were all fill'd with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and began to speak with other <hi>Tongues,</hi> which being opprobriously reflected upon by some, as supposing them to be <hi>Drunk,</hi> S <hi>Peter</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageously disproves, shewing that what had happened, was nothing else but a fulfilling of <hi>Prophecy;</hi> and from several passages of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> convincingly proves that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to rise from the <hi>Dead,</hi> and ascend into <hi>Heaven;</hi> and how by this discourse of his, about 3000 Persons were converted and <hi>Baptized.</hi> Moreover S. <hi>Luke</hi> sets forth the holy qualifications, and happy condition of these first Members of the New born <hi>Christian Church,</hi> Chap. II. How S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S <hi>John</hi> restore a Cripple born, who sate begging at a <hi>Gate</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> to the perfect use of his <hi>Limbs;</hi> whereupon the <hi>People</hi> running toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to see this Miracle, S. <hi>Peter</hi> declares, that this wonderful cure was wrought by the sole <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> whom they had wickedly put to <hi>Death,</hi> and exhorts them to repent and believe in him, Chap. III. That hereupon the chief <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Sadducees,</hi> cause S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> to be seized, and to be brought before the <hi>Council,</hi> where S. <hi>Peter</hi> boldly justifies what they had done; the <hi>Council,</hi> tho' astonish'd at their undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, charge them to preach no more in the name of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> which they absolutely refuse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> declaring to their <hi>Faces,</hi> that it was safer for them to obey GOD than <hi>Men.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> betake themselves to Prayer, which is answered with a further effusion of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> the glorious state of the Primitive <hi>Apostolick Church</hi> described, by their unbounded Love and Charity, Chap.

The 4<hi>th</hi> is the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> clothed with the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> under her <hi>Feet,</hi> and upon her <hi>Head</hi> a <hi>Crown</hi> of 12 <hi>Stars,</hi> who Travailing to bring forth, is Persecuted by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and forc'd to Flee into the <hi>Wilderness;</hi> and of the 2 <hi>Beasts,</hi> the one rising out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> the other coming up out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the <hi>Saints;</hi> against which the <hi>Lamb</hi> on <hi>Mount Zion</hi> doth oppose himself, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the 144000 Sealed ones, having his <hi>Fathers</hi> name written in their <hi>Foreheads;</hi> all which is contained in the 12<hi>th</hi> 13<hi>th</hi> and 14<hi>th</hi> Chapters. The fifth is the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi> and <hi>Plagues</hi> poured forth on the <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> set down in the 15<hi>th</hi> and 16<hi>th</hi> Chapters. The 6<hi>th</hi> represents the great <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> sitting upon a <hi>Scarlet Coloured Beast,</hi> full of names of <hi>Blasphemies,</hi> having 7 <hi>Heads</hi> and 10 <hi>Horns,</hi> and the dreadful <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> upon her; the <hi>Kings, Merchants</hi> and <hi>Mariners</hi> lamenting over her; the <hi>Saints</hi> Song of <hi>Triumph</hi> because of her fall; and <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> at the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly Armies,</hi> engaging and discomfiting the <hi>Beast</hi> and the false <hi>Prophet,</hi> with the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> taking their part, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in the 17<hi>th</hi> 18<hi>th</hi> and 19<hi>th</hi> Chapters. The 7<hi>th</hi> and last <hi>Vision</hi> represents the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Satan,</hi> and his sealing up in the <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless Pit,</hi> for 1000 years; the loosing of <hi>Satan</hi> after the 1000 years are expired, and the end of all things following thereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the last <hi>Judgment</hi> of GOD; after which <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> are cast into the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> and all that were not found written in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Life;</hi> and besides sets forth the <hi>New Heaven</hi> and the <hi>New Earth,</hi> with the great <hi>City;</hi> the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> descending out of <hi>Heaven</hi> from GOD, to be the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glorious Mansion of all the <hi>Saints,</hi> as is contained in the 20, 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 22<hi>th</hi> Chapters.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And here there occurs to us an observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, too remarkable to be omitted, <hi>viz.</hi> the vast difference between the Methods of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> and the ways of the <hi>World;</hi> for whereas the generality of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind looks only upon Pomp, and outward shew; and Pin their <hi>Faith</hi> upon those of great fame in the <hi>World,</hi> for <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Wisdom;</hi> GOD in the Foundation of his <hi>Church</hi> made use of the meanest, obscurest and illiterate Persons, to confound and put to silence those high Points of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> so much then noised in the <hi>World,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by propagated those <hi>Divine Truths,</hi> which Human policy was not able to withstand.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> after the Communication with our <hi>Lord,</hi> for a while returned to his <hi>Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but after our <hi>Saviours</hi> confirming the <hi>Doctrin</hi> he preached, by such a Miraculous draught of <hi>Fish,</hi> and had strengthned his staggering <hi>Faith,</hi> he left all and followed his great <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> and from that time remained constantly his <hi>Follower</hi> and <hi>Disciple.</hi> At this time, <hi>Jesus</hi> had his chief Residence about <hi>Capernaum,</hi> whither S. <hi>Peter</hi> had removed; and here <hi>Peters</hi> Wives Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lying sick of a <hi>Fever,</hi> was raised to health by our <hi>Saviour:</hi> Upon Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> 12 were particularly Pitch'd on to be more immediately attendants on his Person, and to be the constant <hi>Witnesses</hi> of his <hi>Doctrin</hi> and <hi>Miracles:</hi> And these were they that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were called the <hi>Apostles;</hi> and not without reason were they so styled, as being the first Persons whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> appointed as his <hi>Messengers,</hi> to Preach the <hi>Gospel</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and not without the Gift of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> to confirm the <hi>World</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>Doctrin;</hi> nor was the number 12 made choice of in vain, as mysteriously an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering to the 12 <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Israel;</hi> whom he told they should Judge at the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, sitting on 12 <hi>Thrones:</hi> Of these 12 <hi>Apostles, Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were chosen as a <hi>Trumvirate,</hi> and admitted into all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Transactions,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> is generally put the first. After the Feeding the <hi>Multitude</hi> with 5 <hi>Loaves</hi> and 2 <hi>Fishes, Peter</hi> is only mentioned passing or'e the water, to meet his Master. S. <hi>Peter</hi> is frequently styl'd by the Fathers the <hi>Mouth of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> and not without reason; for when our <hi>Saviour,</hi> being forsaken by the <hi>Multitude</hi> at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> turned about to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and asking them, <hi>if they would leave him also?</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of the rest, answered they would not, for that it was <hi>he only had the words of Eternal Life;</hi> And when in the Journy to <hi>Caesarea Philippi,</hi> he asked his <hi>Disciples</hi> what men said of him, and after, what they themselves thought he was? <hi>Peter</hi> gave this positive answer in the name of the rest, <hi>Thou art Christ the Son of the living GOD.</hi> Which hearty Declaration how well it was received, appears by this high <hi>Eulogy</hi> given him in return; <hi>Blessed art thou</hi> Simon Bar-Jonah, <hi>Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father which is in Heaven; therefore I also say unto thee, Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</hi> Moreover, <hi>I will give unto thee, the</hi> Keys <hi>of</hi> Heaven, <hi>and whatsoever thou shalt bind in Earth, shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> upon our <hi>Saviours</hi> Commendations and Words was so Transported with Zeal and Affection for him, that thereby he ran into an Error, which incurr'd his displeasure, no less than before he had received his Applause; for when doubtless out of concernment for his Preservation, he perswaded him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve himself, from those <hi>Sufferings,</hi> he told him he was to undergo, he incurr'd a rebuke that seemed much to lessen the esteem he was lately in, saying to him; <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me Satan,</hi> thou <hi>savourest not the things that be of GOD, but of Man.</hi> However, it soon appeared that this rebuke was but the chastising Lesson of a gracious <hi>Master,</hi> who knew the Error he had committed, was but the effect of his imprudent Zeal: For when our <hi>Saviour</hi> went up to <hi>Mount Tabor,</hi> (as is supposed to confer with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias) Peter</hi> was not left out of the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of

                        <hi>Apostles;</hi> for he with the 2 Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> which accompanied him, were the only <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> and <hi>Spectators</hi> of his <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> which was a Type of his future state of <hi>Glory</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when the <hi>Collectors</hi> of the <hi>Tribute Mony,</hi> came to gather their <hi>Tribute, Peter</hi> is the Person consulted in this Affair; who acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>Saviour</hi> therewith, was immediately ordered to go Fish for the <hi>Shekel,</hi> which was to be paid to the <hi>Collecters,</hi> which accordingly was done. He is chiefly made mention of in all cases of doubt and controversy, as the most inquisitive to be informed, as in the Question, How oft a <hi>Man</hi> is obliged to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give his <hi>Brother</hi> for an injury done; and upon the dismission of the <hi>Young Man</hi> who came partly to ask, what he should do to gain <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> with this answer, That he should sell his <hi>Estate,</hi> and give the <hi>Mony</hi> to the <hi>Poor;</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> puts in his <hi>Quere,</hi> What reward they should have, who had forsaken all their worldly concerns to follow <hi>Christ</hi>? To which he received this satisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. That ample recompence should be given in this <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life</hi> in the other.</p>
                     <p>And now our <hi>Saviour</hi> foreseeing his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension and <hi>Crucifixion</hi> drew on apace, he hastens to celebrate the <hi>Passover</hi> with his <hi>Disciples;</hi> whose <hi>Feet</hi> he wash't, which <hi>Peter</hi> in modesty would have refused, as not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to accept of so great an Honour, for which he met with a Reproof, our <hi>Saviour,</hi> telling him, That <hi>if he wash't him not, he could have no part in him.</hi> Whereupon he resigned himself up to his <hi>Masters</hi> Will, Crying out, <hi>Lord, not my Feet only, but also my Hands and Head.</hi> After the <hi>Last Supper,</hi> and the <hi>Washing</hi> their <hi>Feet,</hi> he began to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course more plainly to them of his going to <hi>Suffer;</hi> and when he spoke of leaving them, and going where they could not follow, <hi>Peter</hi> most particularly shews his resentment, and great zeal to follow him wherever he went, not only to <hi>Prison,</hi> but even to <hi>Death</hi> it self; and in the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Olives,</hi> whither they went, after the Celebration of the <hi>Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> he persists in his resolute constancy to his <hi>Master,</hi> saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Though all the rest should forsake and deny him, yet would not he.</hi>

                     <p>From the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Olives,</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> descended to the Village of <hi>Gethsemane,</hi> and retiring into the <hi>Garden,</hi> he desired <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to watch for some time, whilst he suffered that bitter <hi>Agony.</hi> But see the effects of Human frailty, even in the greatest <hi>Saints;</hi> for he that but lately had so Zealously exprest himself in his <hi>Masters</hi> behalf, could not watch an hour with him in his greatest extremity, but fell fast asleep, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> However our <hi>Lord,</hi> considering well the frailties of <hi>Human Nature,</hi> past over this neglect only with a mild Rebuke, and excuses them saying, <hi>The Spirit is willing, but the Flesh is weak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This attempt might in the Eye of the <hi>World</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have gained him great Reputation, but it met with a check suitable to the rashness of it; especially since he must needs have been better instructed, by his long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> than to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of these Divine <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and how the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were to be fulfilled, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Mankind: Wherefore he was commanded as an offender, to put up his <hi>Sword,</hi> with this severe Reprimand, that, <hi>They who use the</hi> Sword, <hi>should perish by it.</hi> And now we come to a <hi>passage,</hi> which will teach us by his Example, how subject the best <hi>Men</hi> are to failings, and how vain a thing it is, for any to put confidence in his own strength. He that had made so many Asseverations of his Constancy, and never to forsake him, nor denie him, whoever did; not only slunk away with the rest of the <hi>Disciples,</hi> when he was apprehended by his <hi>Enemies;</hi> but in the <hi>High Priests Hall,</hi> when he was tax'd by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Persons, for being one of his <hi>Disciples,</hi> which he utterly denied, and with <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Imprecations,</hi> renounced all knowledg of him. This was his last, and most dangerous fall from those his former Evidences of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and of which our <hi>Saviour</hi> gave him warning, but a little before his Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>viz.

                        <hi>Crowing</hi> of the <hi>Cock,</hi> he went out, and wept bitterly. In fine, his fall seems to have proved <hi>Antaeus</hi> like, his greater rise, and after all his failings was the principal Assertor of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and ready to suffer for it on all occasions. He was the first of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> to whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> appear'd alone after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> according to the Testimony of S. <hi>Luke.</hi> And at that time, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to several of his <hi>Disciples,</hi> at the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> he was the first mentioned of them: And after he had <hi>Eat</hi> with them, of the Fish they caught by his directions, he singled out <hi>Peter,</hi> and had a particular and most affectionate conference with him; the effect of which was the putting it home, whether he had a peculiar love for him, above any of the <hi>Disciples</hi>? To which he answered, <hi>Lord thou knowest I love thee;</hi> upon which he bid him <hi>feed his Sheep;</hi> and for the greater confirmation, all this was repeated 3 several times. Thus oft times in <hi>Holy writ</hi> things answer Mystically in number; a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Denial</hi> is expiated, by a threefold decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Love.</p>

reason, why these men believing should not be <hi>Baptized:</hi> At this the very <hi>Apostles,</hi> and Brethren at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> took offence, and at his return to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> charged him with too much favour to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> See the force of old <hi>Customs,</hi> those that had embrac'd the very <hi>Religion</hi> built upon <hi>Charity,</hi> could not yet quit the old Animosity of their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> towards people of all other <hi>Nations,</hi> but their own; yet at last they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the reasons he gave them, and rendred <hi>GOD</hi> thanks for their Conviction.

No sooner was this <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> broke up, but S. <hi>Peter</hi> went to <hi>Antioch,</hi> where after all the <hi>Christian Prudence</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> he had so lately shewed in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and his excellent ordering of affairs at the House of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his familiar converse with the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> at his first coming there, yet fell into an Error which seemed to contradict all that he had done before; for upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of certain <hi>Jewish Brethren,</hi> out of respect to them, and for fear of their Displeasure, on a sudden left the company of these <hi>Gentiles,</hi> with whom he had before contracted a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, shunning them as persons Unclean, which was a great amazement and disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to them, and an example to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Jews,</hi> to make the like Separation; even <hi>Barnabas</hi> himself, being drawn in by the example of others; the consequence of which could be no less than the hindrance of the <hi>Gospels</hi> Propagation; insomuch that <hi>Paul</hi> thô but a late Convert, was highly concern'd to see <hi>Peters</hi> weak carriage in this affair; and thereupon took upon him to withstand him Face to Face, and reprove him severely for it. And thus far reacheth the account of our <hi>Apostles Life</hi> and <hi>Transactions,</hi> as taken from the 4 <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles:</hi> For the remainder of his <hi>Life</hi> until his <hi>Death,</hi> we must depend upon the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>ancient Writers</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> whose testimony also might sufficiently pass, were it built upon sure proofs, and not for the most part conjectural.</p>

The Substance therefore of this <hi>Epistle</hi> may be reduc'd to these 3 heads, which by an exquisite and holy Skilfulness, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlac'd throughout the whole contexture of it.

In the <hi>Schools</hi> of this <hi>City,</hi> he was brought up from his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and became an excellent proficient in all the polite <hi>Learning</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> yet at the same time he was brought up to a Manual <hi>Trade,</hi> as even the Learnedst of their <hi>Rabbins</hi> were, for enabling them to get a Livelyhood if occasion required it, it being a Maxim (especially amongst the <hi>Jews,) That he who teacheth not his Son a</hi> Trade, <hi>teacheth him to be a</hi> Thief; for <hi>Learning</hi> of old was not made an instrument to get a <hi>Maintenance</hi> by, but for the better polishing the <hi>Mind;</hi> so that the Learned among the <hi>Jews,</hi> were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently denominated (as <hi>Drusius</hi> observes) from some one or other <hi>Handycraft Trade,</hi> as <hi>Rabbi Judah,</hi> the <hi>Baker; Rabbi Jochanan,</hi> the <hi>Shoomaker,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Having at <hi>Tarsus</hi> attained to a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the <hi>Liberal Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> he was sent to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to be instructed in the knowledge of the <hi>Laws;</hi> and for the better accomplishing him in that Study, was put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tuition of <hi>Raban Gamaliel</hi> the Son of <hi>Simon,</hi> (the same probably that took up our <hi>Saviour</hi> in his Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) He was an eminent <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> one of the Families of the <hi>Schools</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and a Person of principal Note and Authority in the <hi>Jewish Sanhedrim,</hi> in which that grave and prudent <hi>Speech,</hi> before mentioned in the Life of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which he made in behalf of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and their <hi>Doctrin,</hi> took great effect. At the Feet of this great <hi>Doctor</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> was brought up, as he himself testifies, and by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions he soon advanced to that degree, that he gain'd himself a Reputation above all his fellow <hi>Scholars:</hi> Moreover he was a strict professor of the Sect of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> which of all others amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> was the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and most Magisterial, and the professors thereof, generally great applauders of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for their <hi>Sanctity,</hi> despising and censure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all others as <hi>Reprobates,</hi> and unworthy of their <hi>Society,</hi> and presuming (as <hi>Josephus</hi> writes,) to govern even <hi>Princes</hi> themselves. With the fiery Genius of this <hi>Sect,</hi> our <hi>Apostle</hi> was too deeply infected, which made him a most zealous Persecutor of the <hi>Saints,</hi> so that <hi>when the blood of the Martyr</hi> Stephen <hi>was shed,</hi> I (saith he with sorrow after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version) <hi>was standing by, consented to his Death, and kept the Rayment of them that slew him.</hi> Nay, of all the Apparators, and

Inquisitors employed by the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> to Execute their <hi>Warrants</hi> upon those upstart <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as they call'd them, who preach'd against the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the tradition of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> he was the Man that strove to be the forwardest.

His stay at this time at <hi>Damascus</hi> was not long, for being warned away by a <hi>Vision</hi> from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> he took a Journey into <hi>Arabia,</hi> where he Preach'd the <hi>Gospel</hi> for 3 years, and then return'd to <hi>Damascus,</hi> where the unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jews</hi> eagerly sought his Ruin, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to seize him, but he escaped thrô the help of the <hi>Disciples,</hi> and the rest of his Friends, who were zealous for his safety.</p>
                     <p>Thus far we have made an entrance into the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of this great <hi>Apostle,</hi> with which there is scarce any thing equally me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable in <hi>History;</hi> nor could the further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution thereof have been omitted, but that all the <hi>Travels</hi> of this <hi>Apostle</hi> in the pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his <hi>Ministry,</hi> from the time of his <hi>Conversion,</hi> to the last of his being at <hi>Rome,</hi> with the most principal <hi>Transactions,</hi> and the several <hi>Accidents</hi> that hapned to him therein, are already related in the exposition of the <hi>Map</hi> of the <hi>Voyages</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and more particularly those of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> to which for avoyding needless Repetitions, the sequel of his <hi>Life</hi> may not unfitly be referr'd.

Not long after at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he is said to write his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians;</hi> and before he left <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he wrote his first <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Moreover he sent from thence by <hi>Apollos</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> whom he left in that <hi>Island</hi> to propagate the <hi>Faith,</hi> and had made him <hi>Bishop</hi> thereof; in which he gives him advice for the better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his <hi>Episcopal Office.</hi> At <hi>Macedonia,</hi> whither he went from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> having by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> received an account of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>'s present state of Affairs, he sent by him at his return, when he was accompanied by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> his 2<hi>d Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and about the same time, he wrote his first <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom he had left at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi> From <hi>Corinth</hi> he went for <hi>Macedon,</hi> whither he sent his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by <hi>Phaebe</hi> a <hi>Deaconess</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrea,</hi> not far from <hi>Corinth.</hi> Going thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> he sent his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Philippians</hi> by <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> who had been sent from them with Relief, not knowing to what streights he might be reduc'd by his Imprisonment at <hi>Rome.</hi> In the next place he sends by <hi>Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> Not long after (if not about the same time,) he wrote his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> and sent it by

Tertullian</hi> judgeth it to be written by <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas;</hi> but the most received Opinion is, that it was S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> but written by him in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> and so sent to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and for the better Publishing it to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> translat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Greek,</hi> some say by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> but others probably by S. <hi>Clement;</hi> for the style of whose <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is observed by <hi>Eusebius</hi> and S. <hi>Jerom</hi> to come very near the style of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> and to contain a purer vein of <hi>Greek,</hi> than is found in the rest of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistles.</hi>

In the first place, it treats concerning the <hi>Justification</hi> of Man before <hi>GOD,</hi> not by any of his works, but by the <hi>Faith</hi> which is in <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> from the 16 <hi>ver.</hi> of the 1<hi>st Chap.</hi> to the end of the 5<hi>th.</hi> Secondly, Of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or the renewal of mans mind, by the new <hi>Birth</hi> in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> from the beginning of the 6<hi>th Chap.</hi> to the beginning of the 7<hi>th;</hi> where he handleth of the <hi>Spiritual Fight,</hi> wherein the <hi>Regenerate</hi> are engaged, by reason of the contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in them; as in the 8<hi>th Chap.</hi> he sets forth the <hi>Victory,</hi> they obtain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> against the <hi>Flesh;</hi> and the great comfort and assurance of <hi>Salvation,</hi> which accrues to them from this conquest, even in the midst of their sore Persecutions and Afflictions.

                     <p>IN this <hi>Epistle,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> chiefly defends his <hi>Doctrin</hi> and <hi>Apostleship,</hi> against the <hi>Accusations</hi> and <hi>Calumnies</hi> of some false <hi>Apostles;</hi> and after a short <hi>Introduction,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the 7 first <hi>verses,</hi> of the 1<hi>st Chap.</hi> he declares to them, to the end of the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the reason why he was not come to them, according to the Promise he had made them, in the foregoing <hi>Epistle;</hi> and that this delay of his, did not proceed from lightness or inconstancy, but by reason of the grievous <hi>Persecutions</hi> he had suffered in <hi>Asia;</hi> as also, because he was desirous to give them time to Repent of, and mend those faults where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had reproved them; to the end he might appear with greater chearfulness, and comfort amongst them.

To this purpose, after the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi> comprised in the 5 first <hi>verses</hi> of the 1<hi>st Chap.</hi> he proves to them, by divers arguments, that they ought not to suffer themselves to be drawn aside from the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin</hi> he had <hi>Preached,</hi> seeing there was no other <hi>Gospel</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> but what he had delivered to them, assuring them that he had not received the same of man, but from <hi>Heaven,</hi> even from <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself, which he demonstrates to them, by the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his former <hi>Conversation</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> and his miraculous <hi>Conversion,</hi> and calling to the <hi>Apostleship;</hi> that accordingly he did not go up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self known to, and confer with the <hi>Apostles</hi> there, but went immediately into <hi>Arabia,</hi> to discharge his <hi>Apostolical Function,</hi> committed to him by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself; that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the most famous amongst the <hi>Apostles,</hi> gave to him the right hand of <hi>Fellowship,</hi> as a sign of their union and agreement in <hi>Doctrin</hi> and <hi>Function:</hi> How he reproved even S. <hi>Peter</hi> himself, because he was not bold enough, in asserting and maintaining the <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> for fear of displeasing some <hi>Jews, Chap.</hi> 1, and 2, to the 15 <hi>verse.</hi> And then in opposition to the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of these <hi>Seducers,</hi> he proves by many strong reasons, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent examples, drawn from <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> that man is <hi>justified</hi> before <hi>GOD,</hi> only by <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and not by the works of the <hi>Law,</hi> whether <hi>Moral,</hi> summarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the 10 <hi>Commandments,</hi> or <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial,</hi> consisting of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward observations, which are all abrogated under the <hi>New Testament;</hi> with a refutation of the <hi>Principal objections,</hi> of these false <hi>Apostles,</hi> from the 15<hi>th ver.</hi> of the 2<hi>d Chap.</hi> to the end of the 4<hi>th.</hi> To which he adds a serious <hi>Exhortation</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> to stand in the liberty, wherewith <hi>Christ</hi> had made them free; with a caution not to abuse it, to carnal Licentiousness, but by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to oppose the <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Flesh;</hi> which he enumerates, and afterwards repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to them the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> in which he exhorts them to walk and <hi>Live, Chap.</hi> 5<hi>th.</hi> And more particularly, he exhorts

them to <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Beneficence,</hi> as well towards <hi>Poor Believers,</hi> as towards the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Word;</hi> and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with a serious warning of them, to take heed of false <hi>Apostles,</hi> representing to them their <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisy,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing his own sincerity; shutting up all with a hearty <hi>Commendation</hi> of them, to the <hi>grace</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>

Wherefore after his <hi>Apostolical Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> contained in the 2 first <hi>verses</hi> of the 1<hi>st Chap.</hi> he declares in a most exquisit and sublime discourse, the saving <hi>Benefits, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> and <hi>Immunities Believers</hi> receive here in time, according to the <hi>Eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> and <hi>Purpose</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to the 15 <hi>ver.</hi> of the same <hi>Chap.</hi> Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration he continues, and concludes with an earnest <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>GOD,</hi> that it would please him, to strengthen and confirm them more and more, in the knowledge of this transcendent Grace, and efficacious virtue of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who being taken up into <hi>Glory.</hi> sits at the <hi>Right Hand</hi> of the <hi>Father;</hi> and is constituted the <hi>Head</hi> over all things.

                     <p>AFter the <hi>Apostolical Inscription</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the two 1<hi>st verses,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> commendeth the <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Perseverance</hi> of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and comforts them against their sufferings, by the coming of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to <hi>Judgment,</hi> for the <hi>Punishment</hi> of <hi>Persecutors,</hi> and their deliverance, in the 1<hi>st</hi> Chap. Afterwards he informs them, that the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> would not come so soon, as some might expect; because a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Apostasie</hi> was to precede it, and the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Antichrist,</hi> whose <hi>Rise, Pride, Deceit</hi> and <hi>Downfal</hi> he <hi>Describes,</hi> adding a repeated exhortation to <hi>Perseverance</hi> in the <hi>Faith,</hi> to the end of the 2<hi>d</hi> Chap. Lastly, he exhorts them to a <hi>Christian Conversation;</hi> particularly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to <hi>Pray</hi> for him, to live in mutual <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> to withdraw themselves from <hi>Brethren</hi> that walk disorderly, and live in <hi>Idleness,</hi> whom he reproves by his own <hi>Example;</hi> and exhorts and commands them to work with quietness and eat their own <hi>Bread,</hi> and adviseth the <hi>Church,</hi> to censure those that shall be found refractory and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. To the 16 <hi>verse</hi> of the 3<hi>d</hi> Chap. and in the 3 following <hi>verses</hi> he concludes the <hi>Epistle,</hi> by his <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>GOD</hi> for them, and wonted greetings. So that this 2<hi>d Epistle,</hi> appears to be much of the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with the first; because the <hi>Apostle</hi> having had no opportunity to visit the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> thought good to write again to them, and back his former <hi>Epistle</hi> for their instruction and <hi>Consolation.</hi>

S. <hi>Peter</hi> also writing to those of the <hi>Circumcision,</hi> witnesseth expresly, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15) that the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> had also writ to them, <hi>according to the wisdom given unto him;</hi> which in all appearance cannot be meant of any other <hi>Epostle</hi> but this.

                     <p>This <hi>Epistle</hi> is a most excellent part of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> in the which (according to the Order commonly observ'd by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the most part of his <hi>Epistles,</hi> and in a lofty and divine <hi>Style</hi>) he treats at large of the transcendent excellency of the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> our Saviour, to the 19<hi>th</hi> Verse of the 10<hi>th</hi> Chapter; and from thence to the end of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> he sets down several <hi>Exhortations,</hi> tending to strengthen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and in a holy and Christian <hi>Conversation.</hi> In the two first Chapters he treats of the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> in the 1st he asserts and proves the Truth of his <hi>Eternal Divine Nature,</hi> and his <hi>Preheminence</hi> above all <hi>Angels;</hi> in the 2d, he demonstrates the Truth of his <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> or <hi>Human Nature,</hi> which he took from the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for our <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to <hi>GOD</hi> the Father. In the 3d and 4th Chapters, he speaks of his <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Office,</hi> exalting the same far above that of the great Prophet <hi>Moses;</hi> declaring, that his <hi>Doctrin</hi> (as being the Eternal <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi>) is far more sublime, worthy, and powerful, than that of <hi>Moses,</hi> or any other <hi>Prophet</hi> whatsoever; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that it ought the more carefully to be heeded and obeyed. In the 5th Chapter, he begins to treat of the <hi>Call</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to his <hi>Sacerdotal Office,</hi> and after a Parenthetical Discourse, reaching from the 11th Verse of that Chapter, to the end of the 6th, wherein he blames their dulness and unfitness to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand these <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and exhorts them to leave the Rudiments of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and to press on to the Perfection of a <hi>Man-like</hi> growth in <hi>Christ;</hi> he in the 7th Chapter proceeds, to set forth the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> and <hi>Kingly Office</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> by a continued Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison between Him and <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> to the end of the Chapter. In the 8th, 9th, and part of the 10th Chapters, he represents the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent Excellence of the <hi>Priestly Office</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> by comparing his <hi>Eternal Priesthood</hi> with the <hi>Levitical Priesthood</hi> of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the <hi>Temporal Covenant</hi> made with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> with the <hi>Eternal Covenant</hi> ratified by the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and therewithal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the former part of this <hi>Epistle.</hi> At the 19th Verse of the 10th Chapter, he proceeds to the latter part, exhorting them in general, to <hi>Obedience</hi> and constant <hi>Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in the abovesaid <hi>Doctrin,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their <hi>Persecutions</hi> and his <hi>Bonds.</hi> In the 11th Chapter, he gives an excellent description of <hi>Faith,</hi> and of its miraculous <hi>power</hi> and <hi>efficacy;</hi> and in the 12th, Discourses of the excellent properties of <hi>Christian Hope</hi> and <hi>Patience:</hi> And in the 13th Chapter, to the 13th Verse, he treats of the Duties of <hi>Christian Love</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his <hi>Epistle</hi> with an earnest and ardent <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>GOD</hi> for them, and a short <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi> with an account of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s being set at Liberty, and his wonted <hi>Salutation.</hi>

Some will have him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is styled in the Catalogue of the <hi>Apostles, Simon</hi> the <hi>Canaanite,</hi> to be of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee;</hi> others (upon the same considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) make him that <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> whose Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Solemnity our <hi>LORD</hi> honoured with his presence; whereas in truth, he was sirnamed <hi>Canaanite</hi> rather from his Temper, which probably was hot and sprightly, than from his Country. <hi>Canaanite</hi> being in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> what <hi>Zelotes</hi> is in <hi>Greek,</hi> which signifies <hi>Zeal;</hi> or else from a particular Sect among the <hi>Jews,</hi> called the <hi>Zelots.</hi> But gross is the mistake of those who will have him the same person with <hi>Simon</hi> Son of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor in the See of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Just.</hi> Being Elected into the <hi>Apostleship,</hi> he continued with his <hi>Brethren</hi> till their disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion up and down the World into their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Provinces;</hi> and then he is said to have taken his Journy to <hi>Egypt, Cyrene,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Africa;</hi> thence thrô <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and all <hi>Lybia,</hi> and lastly, to have come over into the Western <hi>Islands,</hi> and in particular into this Isle of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> where after he had <hi>Preached,</hi> and wrought many <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and undergon a world of Troubles and Difficulties, he suffered <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirmed by <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and <hi>Dorothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> and this is confirmed by the <hi>Greek Meno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies,</hi> which tell us, that he went at last to <hi>Britain,</hi> where having revealed the light of the <hi>Gospel</hi> to many, he was <hi>Crucified</hi> by the <hi>Infidels,</hi> and Buried there.</p>

The <hi>Scripture</hi> hath exactly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out all these Circumstances; and from thence it is that we have taken whatsoever is here set down; from thence it is that we know the <hi>Deluge</hi> hapned in the year of the <hi>World</hi> 1656, being it hapned in the 600<hi>th</hi> year of <hi>Noah</hi> who was Born in the 1056<hi>th</hi> year of the <hi>World.</hi> But as to the particular Transactions in this <hi>Period,</hi> or <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> it will be convenient to make a farther Enlargement.</p>
                     <p>We shall not here say any thing touching the Journal of the first <hi>Week,</hi> and History of the <hi>Creation,</hi> it being treated of in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Old <hi>Testament,</hi> to wit, the <hi>six days</hi> Work; we suppose that the common Year of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which began with the Month of <hi>Tisri,</hi> with the <hi>Equinox</hi> of <hi>Autumn,</hi>

                        <hi>Cain</hi> was born in the first Year of the World; <hi>Abel</hi> in the second, each with their <hi>Female</hi> to be their <hi>Wives;</hi> 'tis said <hi>Cain</hi>'s was called <hi>Calmanna,</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi>'s, <hi>Delbora:</hi> These irregular and incestuous <hi>Marriages,</hi> as now accounted, were not so then, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the first spring of <hi>Nature; GOD</hi> also designing of one <hi>Blood</hi> to make all Mankind, and derive it from the same Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.26. 'Tis not to be doubted, but since the Birth of these two, to that of <hi>Seth, Eve</hi> had more Children, of each <hi>Sex,</hi> and in this first fruitfulness of Nature, more than one at a time; <hi>Whence arose</hi> Cain<hi>'s fear after his Parricide,</hi> Gen. 4.14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> being now grown up, apply themselves, the first to feeding <hi>Cattel,</hi> the latter to the <hi>cultivating</hi> the <hi>Earth;</hi> and worshiping according (without doubt) to the Orders which their <hi>Father</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>GOD:</hi> They offer different <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> according to their different Functions; but <hi>GOD</hi> having given a particular Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> of <hi>Abel,</hi> by <hi>Fire,</hi> or otherwise, <hi>Cain</hi> conceived thereat, so great a Grudge, that he resolved to kill him. <hi>GOD</hi> reprehends him for this unjust malevolency, remembring him of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority he had over his Brother, by <hi>Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> and that <hi>Abel</hi> acknowledging it, as he did, ought not to be the Object of his Hatred. Yet he persists in this wicked humor, draws his Brother apart (under pretence of Kindness) and privately Murthers him. <hi>GOD</hi> calls him to account for it, condemns him to be punish'd, and yet provides for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of his Life; he retires into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Nod,</hi> there begets a Son named <hi>Henoc,</hi> and builds a City (to which he gives the same Name) by the assistance, (without ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) of the rest of his <hi>Brethren,</hi> of their <hi>Families,</hi> and his own, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This <hi>Fratricid</hi> hapned about the Year of the World 130, in which <hi>Seth</hi> was born, whom <hi>GOD</hi> substituted to our first <hi>Parents,</hi> in the place of <hi>Abel, Gen.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Josephus</hi> pretends, that <hi>Seth</hi> erected two different <hi>Columns,</hi> the one of <hi>Brick,</hi> the other of <hi>Stone,</hi> on which he wrote <hi>Astronomical Observations,</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to Posterity. 'Tis certain, that <hi>Seth</hi> apply'd himself to <hi>Piety,</hi> and all manner of <hi>Vertues,</hi> otherwise than the Men of his time; and that <hi>Moses</hi> having said little of the cursed Race of <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4.5. sets on a particular deduction of the Descendents of <hi>Seth;</hi> it being from him that all <hi>Men,</hi> since the <hi>Flood,</hi> draw their Original.</p>
                     <p>Of <hi>Seth,</hi> Aged 105 <hi>Years,</hi> and who lived moreover 807, was born <hi>Enos,</hi> in the Year of the World 235, under whom those who made with <hi>Seth</hi> a Profession of <hi>Piety,</hi> as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>GOD,</hi> began to separate themselves from the profane <hi>Canaanites,</hi> to attend his pure service, <hi>Gen</hi> 4.26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.6.7.</p>

                     <p>Of <hi>Enoch,</hi> Aged 65 years, was born <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 687, <hi>Methusalem</hi> (who lived the longest of all Men, to wit, 969 years) 235 years after his Birth, his Father <hi>Enoch</hi> in the 300 years of his Life, (during which time he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly attended the <hi>LORD</hi>) was carried up into <hi>Heaven,</hi> that he might not see death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.5. After the Death of <hi>Adam, Anno Mundi</hi> 930, the taking up of <hi>Enoch</hi> in the year 987, and the decease of <hi>Seth.</hi> In the year 1042 Corruption slipt in amongst those who made a more particular profession of the Fear and Service of GOD, by the <hi>Marriages</hi> they contracted with the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and others; whence came those fierce and impious <hi>Giants,</hi> Gen. 6.1, 2, 4. which has furnish'd <hi>Paganism</hi> with those Relations of <hi>Gigantomachia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To <hi>Methusalem</hi> (aged 187 years, in the year 874, which was 113 years before the Translation of <hi>Enoch,</hi> and of <hi>Lamech,</hi> aged 182 years) was born <hi>Noah,</hi> in <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 1056, and who was thus named by his Father, as expecting something great and salutary from him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.29. and in effect, tho he were not the <hi>Messias,</hi> who promises and gives Life and Rest to our <hi>Souls,</hi> he was however the <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of him.</p>
                     <p>Under <hi>Noah</hi> the <hi>Herald,</hi> or <hi>Preacher</hi> of Righteousness, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Corruption came to its perfection, and <hi>GOD</hi> began to denounce to Men the resolution of destroying them; yet allowing them the term of 220 years to Repent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Noah,</hi> aged 500 years, and 100 before the <hi>Flood,</hi> began to have his three Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.32. and 6.10. <hi>Japhet</hi> was the eldest, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.24. who was born in the year 1556, or 1557. <hi>Shem,</hi> the second, born in the year 1558; and <hi>Cham,</hi> the youngest, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.24. one or two years after; for in that the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of <hi>Shem</hi> is recited the last, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.20. and 11.10. is not because he was the last amongst these 3, as when he is sometimes named the first, doth not prove he was the eldest; but because to his <hi>Family,</hi> was restrain'd the Promise of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and that from him was born <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom (and his Posterity) <hi>Moses</hi> undertook the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> and not of the other two. About the time of the Birth of <hi>Noah</hi>'s 3 <hi>Children,</hi> he was commanded by <hi>GOD</hi> to build the <hi>Ark,</hi> to preserve in his Family the <hi>Seeds</hi> of Human kind, with all the several species of <hi>Animals,</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> would cause to come there, whereby to replenish the <hi>Earth</hi> after the <hi>Deluge,</hi> Gen. 6.13, &amp;c. During the Life of <hi>Noah,</hi> his Father <hi>Lamech</hi> died, aged 874 years, and in the year of the <hi>World</hi> 1651, which was 5 years before the <hi>Flood;</hi> and <hi>Methusalem</hi> his Grandfather, aged 969 years, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1655, being at the end of the year, or at the beginning of 1656, which was about a Month before the <hi>Deluge</hi> began. <hi>Noah</hi> then in the 600 year of his Life, the 100 of <hi>Japhet,</hi> 98 of <hi>Shem,</hi> 97 of <hi>Cham,</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> 1656, entered into the <hi>Ark</hi> with his <hi>Wife,</hi> his 3 <hi>Sons</hi> and their <hi>Wives,</hi> being but 8 Persons, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. in the 2d Month of the year partly answering our <hi>October,</hi> and partly our <hi>November,</hi> the 17th day of the <hi>Month,</hi> in which the <hi>Deluge</hi> began, which increased for 40 days, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.11, 12, 17, &amp;c. It's not to be doubted, but that this <hi>Deluge</hi> was universal (<hi>Moses</hi> having affirmed it in express terms) and drown'd all Living Creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.19, 20, 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And because that if any place of the <hi>Earth</hi> was to have been exempted, <hi>GOD</hi> perhaps would have sent <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>Family</hi> thither, together with the rest of the Living Creatures, which he designed to spare, without condemning them to so long and incommodious a Prison in the <hi>Ark,</hi> during one whole year.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Deluge</hi> lasted a year and 10 days; it increas'd, and continued in its highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree 150 days, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. at the end of which the <hi>Waters</hi> began to decrease; so that on the 17th of the 7th Month, answering partly to our <hi>March,</hi> and partly to our <hi>April,</hi> the <hi>Ark</hi> rested on the Mountain of <hi>Ararat</hi> in <hi>Armenia:</hi> On the 1st day of the 10th Month of the year, the tops of the highest <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> began to discover themselves; 40 days after <hi>Noah</hi> sent out a <hi>Raven,</hi> and then a <hi>Dove</hi> 7 days after, to see whether the Earth dried, without being certainly informed; but 7 days after the <hi>Dove</hi> returned with an <hi>Olive-Leaf,</hi> whereby the <hi>Patriarch</hi> knew that the <hi>Waters</hi> abated; and being sent out the third time (7 days after) he returned no more. Then on the first day of the year 1657, with which
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:63323:312"/>
began the year 601 of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Earth was wholly dried; whereupon the <hi>Patriarch</hi> took off the Cover from the <hi>Ark,</hi> and thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably let go the <hi>Fowls;</hi> but he waited for the Divine Appointment to go out himself; which he received, and obeyed the 27th day of the 2d Month; and as soon as ever he set foot on the Earth, he built an <hi>Altar,</hi> and offered his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the <hi>LORD,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him, there should be no more such a <hi>Flood;</hi> and establish'd the <hi>Bow,</hi> that is, the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> in the <hi>Heaven</hi> for his infallible Seal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 9.11, 12.</p>

Of <hi>Heber,</hi> aged 34 years, was born <hi>Peleg;</hi> after which, he lived more than 430 years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.10, <hi>&amp;c. Peleg</hi> was thus named, because that in his time the <hi>Earth</hi> was portioned out, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.25. either for that his <hi>Birth</hi> in the year of the World 1757, being 100 yeas after the <hi>Flood,</hi> falls into the time of the confusion of <hi>Languages;</hi> or that his <hi>Father</hi> Prophetically imposed on him this Name, because this should happen in his time, tho at the end of his days; or whether we are to believe a double division of the <hi>Earth,</hi> the first by a bare project, which was fairly carried on under the direction of <hi>Noah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 3 <hi>Brethren;</hi> in pursuit of which, to enlarge and extend themselves, they came from <hi>Armenia,</hi> to encamp in the Land of <hi>Shinar:</hi> The 2d effective, which has necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>Confusion</hi> of <hi>Languages.</hi> 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that under <hi>Peleg,</hi> and during his Life, was first undertaken the Enterprize of the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Babel,</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> overthrew by the <hi>Confusion of Languages,</hi> Gen. 11.1, 2, 3, &amp;c. 2d, <hi>Nimrod</hi> the Son of <hi>Chus,</hi> and <hi>Cham</hi>'s Grandson, who perhaps was the first Author of this haughty design, began by <hi>Babel,</hi> and other places built in the Country of <hi>Shinar;</hi> that is, <hi>Chaldea;</hi> the establishment of his Tyranny, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.8, 9, 10. 3d, Departing out of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> to enlarge it, he past into the Country where <hi>Assur</hi> (who was apparently the 2d or 3d Son of <hi>Shem,</hi> tho <hi>Helam,</hi> and he is mentioned before <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> Gen. 10.24.) had brought his Colony, and there built <hi>Nineveth</hi> after the Name of his Son <hi>Ninus:</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over other <hi>Cities,</hi> as so many <hi>Forts</hi> or <hi>Cittadels</hi> of his Dominion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.11, 12.</p>

Now from the ending of the <hi>Flood</hi> to the Birth of <hi>Phaleg,</hi> there is 100 years; and from the Birth of <hi>Phaleg</hi> to that of <hi>Thares</hi> 121, that being in the year of the <hi>World,</hi> 1757, and this in the year 1878. 'Tis said (<hi>Gen.</hi> 11.27.) that <hi>Thares</hi> at the age of 79 years begat <hi>Abraham, Nachor,</hi> and <hi>Haran.</hi> Now as 'tis certain they were not all born at a time; so 'tis apparent from Scripture, that <hi>Haran</hi> was the eldest, <hi>Nachor</hi> the 2d, called by his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers Name, and <hi>Abraham</hi> the 3d, altho he be called the first, as well on account of the Reputation of his Person, as for that he was the Root of the People of GOD, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Faithful.</p>

As to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he was younger by 59 or 60 years, than his eldest Brother; he was Born in the 130th year of <hi>Thares,</hi> in the year of the <hi>World</hi> 1808, and 75 years before the Death of his Father: For <hi>Abraham</hi> was aged 75 years when he went out of <hi>Haran,</hi> to come into <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 12.4. and not having left <hi>Haran</hi> till after the death of <hi>Thares,</hi> Acts 7.4. who had lived 205 years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.32. he must be born in the 130th year of his Father; and thus the Birth of <hi>Abraham</hi> terminates it self in 2008.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> then lived with <hi>Thares</hi> his Father 75 years, seeing that <hi>Thares</hi> died in the year 2083; with <hi>Serug</hi> 41, seeing he died in the year 2049; with <hi>Rehu</hi> 18, seeing he died in <hi>Anno</hi> 2026; with <hi>Heber,</hi> who died in the year 2187, 179; 121 with <hi>Selah,</hi> who died in the year 2129; with <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> who died in the year 2096, 88; with <hi>Shem</hi> 150, seeing he died in the year 2158; but not with <hi>Noah,</hi> who died aged 950 years, 2 years before the Birth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> seeing he departed this Life in the year of the <hi>World</hi> 2006.

shall not take much Notice here of what the <hi>Jews</hi> have asserted, touching <hi>Serug,</hi> that he was a <hi>Painter;</hi> and of <hi>Thares,</hi> that he was a <hi>Statuary,</hi> and employed himself in making of <hi>Idols;</hi> and concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been condemn'd to be burnt alive in the <hi>Fire</hi> which the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> worshipped, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them of their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously delivered thence.

This Sojourning in <hi>Haran</hi> lasted with <hi>Abraham</hi> for 5 years; for <hi>Thares</hi> being dead at the end of this term, <hi>Abraham</hi> (who was already on his March to come into the Land which GOD would shew him) departed by his order to come into <hi>Canaan,</hi> aged 75 years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.</p>

It is apparent that <hi>Moses</hi> wrote nothing which was not in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Man, since he was not above 4 or 5 Generations from <hi>Adam. Isaac</hi> likewise lived in their time, that had known those Persons that saw the <hi>Deluge,</hi> which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he could not be ignorant of, no more than what past at the <hi>Creation</hi> could be unknown at the time of the <hi>Deluge,</hi> since there were People then living, who had seen those that knew <hi>Adam</hi> himself. So <hi>Adam</hi> could not be unknown to <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Sem,</hi> nor they to <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> especially at a time when there were no <hi>Histories</hi> which men could make use of, or have recourse unto. We shall make a further enlargement on this <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Period</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                     <p>In the 70th year of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the <hi>World</hi> 2078, he began his <hi>Travels,</hi> which continued for the space of 105 years, which was to the end of his life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.7. And from the vocation of the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> and the beginning of his <hi>Travels,</hi> till the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> are found the 430 years mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.40. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> 3.17. of which the first 215 are for <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the other 215 for the abode and servitude of their Posterity in <hi>Egypt:</hi> Yet here is found some disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the most exact <hi>Chronologists;</hi> for some begin the 430 years only at the year 75, and others at the year 85 of the <hi>Patriarch;</hi> but we are for keeping to what best agrees with the <hi>Text</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Birth of <hi>Isaac,</hi> in the year 160 of his <hi>Father,</hi> and the 400 spoken of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.6.</p>

                        <hi>Joseph</hi> was born to <hi>Jacob</hi> in the 14th year of his service, and the 91st of his life; for <hi>Joseph</hi> was 30 years old when he appeared before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Gen. 41.46. and 7 years of <hi>Plenty,</hi> and 2 of <hi>Famine</hi> were already past, since the time that <hi>Jacob</hi> came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> aged 130 years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.9. which makes up our reckoning; so that <hi>Joseph</hi> being 17 years old, when he began to be hated by his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.2. <hi>Jacob</hi> in the 11th year of his Return into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and which might be the first of his more near approaches to his Father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.27. must be aged about 108 years. And this age of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> falls in with the year of the World 2276. Then <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren, especially those of the 2d Rank, who were born of <hi>Leah,</hi> and <hi>Rachel</hi>'s Servants, began to prosecute him with their Hatred, as well for the relation of his <hi>Dreams,</hi> which presaged the Dominion over them, as the Reports which he made to his Father, of their naughty Behaviour. But GOD having hindered (by <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi>) the Murthering of him, which these unnatural Wretches projected, he was sold to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianite Merchants,</hi> and by them to <hi>Potiphar,</hi> a great Officer under the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whilst <hi>Jacob</hi> bewails the loss of his <hi>Joseph,</hi> the bloody <hi>Coat</hi> which was brought him, caused him to believe that he was torn by some <hi>wild Beasts.</hi>

                        <hi>Isaac</hi> his Father quietly ends the rest of his days, <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2288, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the 180th year of his life, after the Death of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> already deceased before his Return into <hi>Canaan.</hi> His 2 Sons were present at his Death, and honourably buried him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.27, 28, 29. This was in the 120th year of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Life, and the 12th since the sale of <hi>Joseph;</hi> after which hapned what's recited of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Tamar,</hi> Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The short of which is thus; <hi>Judah</hi> was about 10 years old when his Father returned into <hi>Canaan;</hi> having soon contracted too great familiarity with <hi>Hira,</hi> he was persuaded to espouse the Daughter of a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> who was scarce at the years of Puberty; yet he had a Son of her named <hi>Er,</hi> in the 13th or 14th year of his Life; at which we need not be astonish'd, if we remember the <hi>Jews</hi> hold by an old Tradition, That a Man is obliged to Marry at 13 years of age. His two other Sons <hi>Onan</hi> and <hi>Selah,</hi> were born in the two following years. 13 or 14 years after, <hi>Er</hi> his eldest Son espouses <hi>Tamar;</hi> but he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely dies, the Father then gives to <hi>Onan,</hi> whom <hi>GOD</hi> likewise punished by a speedy death for his filthy Crime. <hi>Judah</hi> promises to give her to the third, when he should be of Age, and obliges her in the mean time to remain a <hi>Widow</hi> in her Fathers House; but seeing her self deluded, she disguises her self in the Garb of an <hi>Harlot,</hi> and becomes a Prostitute to <hi>Judah</hi> himself, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who she was. Having understood she was with Child, he prosecutes her to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for an <hi>Adulteress,</hi> as being betrothed to his 3d Son; but she discovers to him who it was by; and was Delivered of 2 Twins <hi>Phares</hi> and <hi>Zara.</hi> See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of this <hi>Gen.,</hi> 38.1. And supposing the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:63323:316"/>
Marriage of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Birth of <hi>Er,</hi> hapned in the 14th year of his Life, and four years after the Return of <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that 14 years after followed the Marriages of <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan</hi> with <hi>Tamar,</hi> and that she past one year of Widowhood in her Father's House; the Birth of <hi>Pharez,</hi> and <hi>Zara</hi> may be terminated to the 19th or 20th year of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Return into <hi>Canaan;</hi> and so moreover may have been born of <hi>Pharez</hi> in the same Country, <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Hamul, Gen.</hi> 46.12. <hi>Judah</hi> must needs have been Married much sooner than his other Brethren, seeing he alone went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> having already Children of his Children. 'Tis thought <hi>Job</hi> was born about this time, tho the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> doth not take notice thereof. Whilst these things past in <hi>Canaan, Joseph</hi> serv'd in <hi>Egypt</hi> and remained several years with <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar,</hi> till refusing the impure sollicitations of his Masters Wife, he was by her Calumnies shut up in Prison; to whom the <hi>Gaoler,</hi> in time, committed the Chief care of the place. Here he interprets the dreams of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>Cup-bearer</hi> and <hi>Baker;</hi> he informs the <hi>Cup-bearer</hi> of his Innocency, and entreats him, when at Liberty, (which was 3 days after) that he would remember him; but he forgets him till two years after he was delivered out of Prison, to interpret <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>Dream,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the years of <hi>Plenty</hi> and <hi>Famine</hi> which were to happen; whereupon (for this and the prudent Advice he gave on this occasion, the whole Government of <hi>Egypt</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, and the second place of the Kingdom, that is next unto the King, given him, <hi>Gen.</hi> Cap. 39, 40, <hi>&amp;</hi> 41. This was in <hi>Joseph</hi>'s first year, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.46. and the 121st of <hi>Jacob,</hi> in which he was exalted in this high Dignity, and married <hi>Asenath</hi> the Governour of <hi>Onan</hi>'s Daughter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.45.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2289. <hi>Manasses</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> were born to <hi>Joseph</hi> before the Famine began, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.50. <hi>Jacob</hi> sends at the first Year of Scarcity his Sons into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to buy Corn: <hi>Joseph</hi> knew his <hi>Brethren,</hi> but is not known of them; retains <hi>Simeon</hi> as an <hi>Hostage,</hi> and enjoyns them to bring <hi>Benjamin,</hi> Gen. 42.1, &amp;c. They return the year following, having <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> with them, and at the last he discovers himself to them, and sends <hi>Chariots,</hi> Gen. 44.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jacob</hi> then comes into <hi>Egypt</hi> in the second Year of the Famine, being in the 130th year of his Life, with all his Family, which (reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Joseph</hi> and his two Sons) are 70 <hi>Souls,</hi> and were entertained in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Goshen,</hi> Gen. 46.27, 28. and Chapter 47.9. <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2298. He lived moreover 17 years in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 47.18. and having stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to be Interred in <hi>Canaan,</hi> Gen. 47.30. he blesses and adopts <hi>Joseph</hi>'s 2 Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.5. and prophetically declares to all his <hi>Children</hi> what would happen to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He died aged 147 years, and his <hi>Body</hi> was embalmed after the <hi>Egyptian</hi> manner; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back in great solemnity into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and laid with his Fathers, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.1, &amp;c. 'Tis thought that <hi>Job</hi> at 30 years of age, <hi>Anno</hi> 2315, almost about the same time when <hi>Jacob</hi> expired in <hi>Egypt,</hi> espous'd his Wife, whom the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters call <hi>Balsorra,</hi> originally of <hi>Arabia,</hi> of whom he had 7 <hi>Sons</hi> and 3 <hi>Daughters,</hi> Job 1.2.</p>

                        <hi>Levi</hi> going down into <hi>Egypt</hi> with <hi>Jacob</hi> his Father, had 3 Sons, <hi>Gershon, Kehath,</hi> and <hi>Marari,</hi> all very young and unmarried; of <hi>Kehath</hi> was born <hi>Amri,</hi> the Father of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moses:</hi> And tho the <hi>Scripture</hi> does not design the time of his Birth, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently refer it to the 91st year of <hi>Joseph,</hi> and the 103d year of <hi>Levi,</hi> which is Eleven years before the Death of <hi>Joseph,</hi> who lived 110 years, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.16. A term which falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the 60th year of the descent of the <hi>Israelites</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Joseph</hi> having gotten into the <hi>King</hi>'s pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session all the Lands of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> except those of the <hi>Priests,</hi> provided for his <hi>Father</hi>'s Family, assured his <hi>Brethren</hi> of his affection, happily governed <hi>Egypt</hi> 80 years, dies 54 years after his <hi>Father,</hi> and orders his <hi>Bones</hi> to be carried into <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 50.24, 25, 26. The Vulgars making the History of <hi>Genesis</hi> of 2300 years, is partly to make the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber run smooth, and partly to place the Birth of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the 70th year of his Father <hi>Terah,</hi> altho he was not born till the year 130, as has been already observed. A while after the Death of <hi>Joseph,</hi> those of <hi>Gath</hi> killed the Sons of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who was thereat greatly afflicted, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.20. The <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> does not mark the years, nor the death of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s other Sons excepting <hi>Levi</hi>'s, who died aged 137 years, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.6. And thus supposing he was four years older than <hi>Joseph,</hi> he must have lived 24 years more than he. We may presume, that the others more aged nearly followed <hi>Joseph;</hi> but 'tis certain none of them died before him, as may be seen, <hi>Gen</hi> 50.24. where he charges them to carry
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:63323:316"/>
his <hi>Bones</hi> with them, when their Posterity they should depart out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Supposing that <hi>Kehath</hi> was aged 70 years when <hi>Amri</hi> was born, for the <hi>Scripture</hi> is silent, having lived 133 years, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.18. he must have died in the 123d year of the descent of <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> 54 years after <hi>Joseph,</hi> and 33 years after <hi>Levi</hi> his Father; which we distinctly represent, to verify, that all <hi>Moses</hi> Ancestors were dead, to wit, <hi>Jacob, Levi, Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hath,</hi> and <hi>Amram,</hi> who lived 137 years, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.20. when he was sent to the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the people, seeing that since the 60th year of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s descent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the 215th year, in which his Posterity went out, there are 155.</p>
                     <p>The death of <hi>Joseph,</hi> and that of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whom we may suppose not to have lived longer than <hi>Levi,</hi> was followed with the Persecution which their Descendents suffered in <hi>Egypt,</hi> of which see <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.6, 8, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amram</hi> in the 67th year of his Life, and 127 of the descent of <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> espouses <hi>Jokebed</hi> his Kinswoman, either his Aunt, his Father <hi>Kehath</hi>'s Sister, or his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin German, the Daughter of <hi>Gershon,</hi> or of <hi>Merari,</hi> one of his Unkles, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.1. and 6.20. Of this Marriage was born first <hi>Mary,</hi> whom the Father called by this Name, by reason of the bitter condition in which all the people then lay, being under the violent Tyranny of this <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whom common Writers have named <hi>Amenophis.</hi> Four years after the Birth of <hi>Mary, Aaron</hi> was born, and <hi>Moses</hi> 3 years after him.</p>
                     <p>After the Birth of <hi>Aaron</hi> the <hi>King</hi> seeing the means heretofore used for the oppression of the people did not succeed, and that the more they were afflicted, the more they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.12. took a Resolution secretly to put to death all the Males, intending to oblige the Midwives <hi>Siphora</hi> and <hi>Puah</hi> to stifle them in the Birth; which they would not do, excusing themselves to the Tyrant by an ingenious Artifice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.15, &amp;c. But he afterwards used open violence, enjoyning that all the Males should be drowned in the <hi>Nile. Moses</hi> being Born under this cruel Edict, in <hi>Anno</hi> 2428, was expos'd on the <hi>Nile</hi> 3 months after. The Daughter of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whom some name <hi>Thermutis,</hi> others <hi>Merris,</hi> causes the Thing in which he was, to be brought her from amongst the <hi>Rushes,</hi> where the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of <hi>Water</hi> had carried it, and being moved with Compassion, resolved to save its life, which <hi>Mary</hi> (a little Girl of 7 or 8 years old) observing, offers her self to the <hi>Princess</hi> to find out a <hi>Nurse,</hi> and brings her the <hi>Mother,</hi> who is charged to suckle and take care of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When he was grown up, <hi>Jokebed</hi> his Mother brings him to the <hi>Princess,</hi> who Adopts him for her own, gives him the Name of <hi>Moses,</hi> because she had taken him out of <hi>Waters,</hi> Exod. 2.10. and has him carefully brought up in all the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Learning, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>'Tis thought he had several great Offices in the <hi>Kings Court,</hi> where he was considered as the presumptive Heir of the <hi>Crown;</hi> but he slipped all the Honours and Advantages in the World, when they stood in competition with his service of <hi>GOD, Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26.

                        <pb n="365" facs="tcp:63323:317"/>There is nothing in this <hi>Table,</hi> which is not taken from <hi>Holy Scripture:</hi> But nothing is here said of <hi>Sampson,</hi> as great and mighty as the Atchievements which he acted in the time of <hi>Eli;</hi> so that we must take half the years of <hi>Eli</hi> (that is to say 20) and give them to <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> as several have done before.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed according to our former Method in the foregoing Ages. This <hi>Period</hi> is expresly defined 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.1. and in effect the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were under the Conduct of <hi>Moses</hi> 40 years, 17 under that of <hi>Joshuah,</hi> under <hi>Judges</hi> 299, under <hi>Eli, Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> 80, under <hi>David</hi> 40; and it was in the 4th year of <hi>Solomon,</hi> when the Foundations of the <hi>Temple</hi> were laid.</p>
                     <p>This express <hi>Text</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> can't be opposed by the Passage of the <hi>New,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.20. which seems to denote about 450 years since the destruction of the 7 Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to <hi>Samuel.</hi> For not to alledge here whatever may be said for the reconciling of these 2 passages, all the difficulty will be removed, if we keep to some ancient <hi>Greek Copies,</hi> followed by the vulgar Version in the Book of the <hi>Acts;</hi> which contain, That <hi>GOD having destroyed</hi> 7 <hi>Nations in the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>he delivered their Lands by Lot about</hi> 450 <hi>years after, and afterwards gave them Judges, till the Prophet</hi> Samuel. So that this term of 450 years agrees with what is said in the 17th Verse, That <hi>GOD</hi> had chosen our Fathers (in the Vocation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in the Birth of <hi>Isaac</hi>) and that after the 450th of this Election, the People who were descended, had obtained under <hi>Joshuah</hi> the division or portion of the <hi>Country;</hi> and this term will be easily found, if we joyn the 400 years which slipt till the Birth of <hi>Isaac,</hi> to the departure of the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the 40 years which past in the <hi>Desart,</hi> with the 7 first of <hi>Joshuah,</hi> after which began the dividing of the <hi>Country;</hi> and 'tis far better to keep to this, than to attempt the correcting of either <hi>Text,</hi> and to say, therein is an Error, whether in the first of 480 for 580, or in the second of 450 for 350. 'Tis not necessary to cut the Knot, when one may unty it.</p>

In the same time as the <hi>Ammonites</hi> (towards the end of the Government of <hi>Jair</hi>) used their endeavours against the People of <hi>GOD</hi> whom <hi>Jeptha</hi> represt; the <hi>Philistins</hi> also made new Attempts, <hi>Judges</hi> 10.7. after the first Essay, in which <hi>Shamgar</hi> had resisted in his time; and they continued the space of 40 years, <hi>Judges</hi> 13.1. until <hi>Sampson,</hi> the <hi>Israelites Hercules,</hi> who Judged <hi>Israel</hi> 20 years, began to encourage them; for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Israelites</hi> lay not still without Reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations, frequently opposing the <hi>Philistins</hi> even under <hi>Eli,</hi> altho with different Successes, sometimes beating, and other whiles being beaten, till <hi>Samuel,</hi> Judges 16.31. He is

also called <hi>Bedan,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.11. See the miraculous History of <hi>Sampson,</hi> Judges Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters 13, 14, 15, 16. After his Death, in which expired the Year 299 from that of <hi>Joshuah; Eli</hi> the <hi>High Priest</hi> Judged <hi>Israel</hi> 40 years, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.18. The Sacred History does not denote, when died <hi>Phineas</hi> the Son and Successor of <hi>Eleazer</hi> in the <hi>High Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;</hi> nor how this Dignity past from <hi>Eleazers</hi> Family, who was <hi>Aarons</hi> eldest Son, into that of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> who was the youngest: For <hi>Eli</hi> descended of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> as is seen 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.3, 4. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.4. So also it return'd in <hi>Zadock</hi> to its first Branch, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.27. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.8. Some make <hi>Eli</hi> to succeed immediately to <hi>Phineas</hi> about the time when <hi>Sampson</hi> began to act against the <hi>Philistins;</hi> but there appears no reason for giving of <hi>Phineas</hi> such a long life, which must have exceeded the term of 300 years. Some say <hi>Phineas</hi> was deposed on occasion of <hi>Jeptha</hi>'s Vow; Some say for having approved of the bloody Execution, and others for designing to hinder it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Josephus</hi> pretends, that after <hi>Phineas,</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their order <hi>Abishah</hi> his Son, and <hi>Bukki</hi> his Grandson, of whom is mention, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.50, 51. And perhaps after the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature death of <hi>Bukki,</hi> we should pass by <hi>Eli</hi> to the branch of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> not to find any one in that of <hi>Eleazer,</hi> who was of competent age, or who had all the requisite Conditions for this employ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Samuel</hi> was born under him, and grew up with the time, fit for the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> which was then at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> Chap. 1, &amp; 2. The Sons of <hi>Eli, Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ill, at which he is reprehended by a <hi>Prophet,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.22, 27, &amp;c. and also by the Ministry of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1, &amp;c. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the Government, and life of <hi>Eli,</hi> there was a great Fight between the <hi>Philistins</hi> and <hi>Israelites,</hi> in which these latter were worsted, <hi>Eli</hi>'s 2 Sons killed, and the <hi>Ark</hi> taken; at this sorrowful News brought to <hi>Philoh, Eli</hi> aged 98 years, and deprived of the use of his sight, falls from his Chair and breaks his Neck; and his Daughter-in-Law, the wife of <hi>Phineas,</hi> dies in <hi>Child-Bed,</hi> and calls her Son <hi>Ichabod,</hi> more afflicted for the taking of the <hi>Ark,</hi> than for the death of her Husband, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.10.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 2984. The <hi>Ark,</hi> altho a Prisoner, yet triumphs over the <hi>Philistins,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who sent it back again into <hi>Israel</hi> at the end of 7 Months; and arrives at <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shemes,</hi> and the People of those parts are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with a great <hi>Plague,</hi> for having look'd into the <hi>Penetralia</hi> of it; for there died 70070 Men, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.1, &amp;c. From <hi>Bethshemes</hi> it's carried to <hi>Kirjathjeharim</hi> to <hi>Aminidab,</hi> where it remained 20 years without being removed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.1, 2. for it seems not to have been till<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Samuel</hi> made it be brought and set down at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> for a while after the Anointing of <hi>Saul,</hi> which is thought may be collected from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14, &amp; 13.4.</p>
                     <p>Now altho' 'twas some Consolation to the People to see the <hi>Ark</hi> returned, yet they found their Affairs in great disorder after the loss of so great a <hi>Battle:</hi> But <hi>Samuel</hi> having convocated the People at <hi>Mitspa,</hi> the <hi>Philistins,</hi> who took hold of this occasion to invade the <hi>Israelites,</hi> are put to flight by means of a great <hi>Thunder,</hi> and pursued as far as <hi>Bethcar,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.3, &amp;c. From that time the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listins</hi> were kept in some awe, till after the decease of <hi>Samuel;</hi> for he retook the <hi>Towns</hi> which they had obtained from the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and continued in his Magistracy as long as he lived, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.13, 14, 15. And tho' <hi>Saul</hi> was established King by him, yet he still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd some remains of his first Authority till his death.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> attributes 40 years to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and to <hi>Saul</hi> conjoyntly, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.21. But we are not certain how many years <hi>Saul</hi> reigned, nor how many he survived <hi>Samuel,</hi> whose death is mentioned 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.1. 'Tis certain that <hi>Samuel</hi> being old, and his Sons, whom he began to establish <hi>Judges</hi> over <hi>Israel</hi> degenerating from his Vertue, the Ancients of the People ask'd a <hi>King</hi> of him, and he set before them, what they must then expect, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.1, &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Saul</hi> the <hi>Benjamite</hi> is divinely directed to <hi>Samuel,</hi> who Anoints him as <hi>King,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents him to all the People convocated at <hi>Mitspa,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> Chap. 9, &amp; 10. His first Exploit of War was to raise the Siege, which <hi>Nahash</hi> the <hi>Ammonite</hi> had laid against <hi>Jabesh</hi> of <hi>Giliad;</hi> which succeeding, he thereby won the affection of the People, even of those who had at first despised him, and he is by <hi>Samuel</hi> solemnly confirmed in his Dignity, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.1, &amp;c. <hi>Samuel</hi> takes occasion in this Assembly to justifie his Conduct, to reprehend the People for their lightness, to exhort them to their duty, and to astonish them by a great Mircale, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>

12.1, &amp;c. In the 2d year of King <hi>Saul Jonathan</hi> his Son repels the <hi>Philistin Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,</hi> which lay near <hi>Gilboa;</hi> whereupon they reinforce themselves, and come to <hi>Michmash. Samuel</hi> in this publick Consternation had charged <hi>Saul</hi> to expect him at <hi>Gilgal;</hi> but he being impatient, and under pretence of <hi>Devotion,</hi> offers <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> for which he is sharply reprehended by <hi>Samuel,</hi> who makes known to him his Rejection, and that another should be substituted in his place, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.1, &amp;c. Now in this Terror the People being half Unarm'd, <hi>Saul</hi> stands only on the defensive, and contents himself with guarding the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages: But <hi>Jonathan</hi> having only his <hi>Shield-Bearer</hi> with him, ascends between 2 <hi>Rocks</hi> to attack the <hi>Philistins Corps de Gard,</hi> and does great Execution amongst them, and thereby puts the <hi>Enemies Army</hi> into great confusion and dissention: Upon which <hi>Saul</hi> (with his Army) pursues them; and those <hi>Israelites,</hi> whom Fear had made to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, now come out and joyn themselves to him; so that the Defeat was very great. See all the particulars, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> Chap. 14. Being heartned by his Victory, he beats this Enemy on all sides, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.47. reccives Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment by <hi>Samuel</hi> to fall on the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites,</hi> over whom he gains a signal Victory; but spares King <hi>Agag,</hi> and great store of <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</hi> and <hi>Booty,</hi> contrary to the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But <hi>Samuel</hi> put <hi>Agag</hi> to death of his own Authority, and from that time he saw <hi>Saul</hi> no more, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>David,</hi> when as yet young, not exceeding 20 or 22 years, is secretly Anointed by <hi>Samuel</hi> King over <hi>Israel,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.13. But <hi>Saul</hi> being troubled with an Evil Spirit, <hi>David</hi> is sent for to play on <hi>Musical Instruments</hi> before him, during these vexatious Paroxisms, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.18, &amp;c. The <hi>Philistins</hi> having reassembled their Forces, have <hi>Goliah</hi> in their Army, who braving that of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and offering to decide the Quarrel by a single Combat, is undertaken, and kill'd by <hi>David;</hi> which conciliates a real Kindness from <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and the Envy and Hatred of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.1. From hence arose divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions against <hi>David,</hi> which the Sacred Story gives a particular account of, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> Chap. 18, &amp;c. to which we owe several of his <hi>Psalms.</hi> First, <hi>Saul</hi> endeavoured to pierce him with his <hi>Javelin,</hi> 1 Sam. 18.10, 11. Then he makes him a Collonel of a 1000 Men, to make him perish by his Enemies; but he met every where with Success, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.13, &amp;c. He afterwards promises him <hi>Merab</hi> his eldest Daughter, but gives her to <hi>Hadriel,</hi> 1 Sam. 18.17, &amp;c. but in her stead he gives him <hi>Michal,</hi> the youngest, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of him for her Dowry, 100 of the <hi>Philistins</hi> Fore-skins. <hi>David</hi> furnishes him with double the number, and Espouseth her, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.20, &amp;c. After this Marriage, <hi>Saul</hi> designs to Assassinate him; but <hi>Jonathan</hi> hinders him the first time, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>David</hi> being well received again by the King, obtains from him a notable Victory against the <hi>Philistins,</hi> 1 Sam. 19.7, 8. This lasted not long, for being vexed with his Evil Spirit, as <hi>David</hi> played on the Harp before him, he tries again to kill him with his <hi>Javelin. David</hi> declines the Stroak, and hastens to his own House: <hi>Saul</hi> besieges it; but by the prudence of <hi>Michal</hi> he escapes also this Danger, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He comes then towards <hi>Samuel,</hi> and retires with him to <hi>Naioth;</hi> where <hi>Saul</hi> sends first, and then comes himself to take him, but in vain, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> being afterwards come secretly to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> they contrive together how to provide for his safety; he is determin'd for <hi>Nob,</hi> where <hi>Abimelech</hi> the <hi>High Priest</hi> gives him the <hi>Consecrated Bread,</hi> for want of other, and <hi>Goliah</hi>'s <hi>Sword,</hi> with which he goes towards <hi>Achish</hi> King of <hi>Gath;</hi> where seeing his Life in danger, he counterfeits himself Mad to escape, and is on this account driven from the Court, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> Chap. 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 21. This <hi>Achish</hi> is also called <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Psal. 34.1. But as to the <hi>High Priest, Abimelech,</hi> he was the Son of <hi>Ahitub;</hi> and this was of <hi>Phineas</hi> the Son of <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 14.3. and 22.11. so that <hi>Ahitub</hi> obtained the <hi>High Priesthood</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Fathers and Grandfathers death, and left it afterwards to his Son <hi>Abimelech,</hi> who was also called <hi>Ahijah,</hi> 1 Sam. 14.3. Thence he saves himself in the Cave of <hi>Adullam,</hi> where his near Friends came and found him, together with others, to the number of 400 Fighting Men. He secures his Father and Mother in the Country of <hi>Moab,</hi> whence he parts by the advice of <hi>Gad,</hi> an holy Prophet of great esteem in that time, to come into the Land of <hi>Juda,</hi> in the Forrest of <hi>Herets,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Idumean</hi> tells <hi>Saul,</hi> he had seen him at <hi>Nob,</hi> and how <hi>Abimelech</hi> received him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Saul</hi> not only puts him, but all the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:63323:321"/>
                        <hi>Priests</hi> of his Family to death, to the number of 85, destroys the whole Town of <hi>Nob,</hi> and puts all the Inhabitants (without distinction of Sex or Age) to the Sword. <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Son of <hi>Abimelech</hi> having only escaped this Slaughter retired towards <hi>David,</hi> and brought him the News, and succeeded him in his time in the Dignity of <hi>High Priest,</hi> 1 Sam. 22.9, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Tho <hi>David</hi> was only armed for his own preservation, yet he ceased not on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to use his Arms for the Publick, and therefore he goes and Charges the <hi>Philistins</hi> at <hi>Kehila,</hi> and delivers the Town from their hands. <hi>Saul</hi> thinks to surprize him, and the Inhabitants were ready to deliver him; but being warned of their design from <hi>GOD,</hi> he departs, and retires to the Desart of <hi>Ziph,</hi> where <hi>Jonathan</hi> comes and finds him. The <hi>Ziphians</hi> advertize <hi>Saul</hi> thereof, and offer themselves for his Guides to pursue him: But <hi>David</hi> having notice of his March, shifts from him, until the <hi>Philistins</hi> being entred into the Country obliged <hi>Saul</hi> to desist from his Pursuit, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> being delivered from so eminent a danger in the Desart of <hi>Mahon,</hi> retires to the strong places of <hi>Engeddi,</hi> of which <hi>Saul</hi> being advertiz'd, goes in search of him, and falls into the hands of <hi>David,</hi> in a <hi>Cave</hi> where he was hid, and contented himself with cutting off a piece of his <hi>Garment,</hi> as a token that he might have killed him, if he would, whereupon <hi>Saul</hi> acknowledges his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and desires of him, that when he should come to the Crown, he would not destroy his Family. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. Not long after this <hi>Samuel</hi> dies, and <hi>David</hi> retires with his Friends to the Desart of <hi>Paran;</hi> he sends to demand Provisions of <hi>Nabal,</hi> whose People had received all manner of good Offices from him in the Desart, yet he refuses them; but <hi>Abigal</hi> his Wife dexterously prevents the Misery which her Husbands Churlishness had drawn on him, at which he dies with Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>David</hi> Marries his Widow, whom he adds to <hi>Ahinoam</hi> his other Wife, which he had espoused after <hi>Saul</hi> had taken <hi>Michal</hi> from him, and Married her to <hi>Palti,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.1, &amp;c. After this the <hi>Ziphians</hi> go to <hi>Saul</hi> the 2d time, and advertize him, that <hi>David</hi> was again returned towards them; whereupon he again pursues him with 3000 Men. <hi>David</hi> enters by Night into his <hi>Camp,</hi> goes into his <hi>Tent,</hi> takes his <hi>Javelin</hi> which stuck at his Beds-head, and his <hi>Pot of Water,</hi> and passes on the other side, rouses <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and shews them again, that the Kings Life was in his hands; at which <hi>Saul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, acknowledges his Fault, and promises to desist from persecuting him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.1, &amp;c. Yet <hi>David</hi> durst not confide in his word, but retires into the Country of the <hi>Philistins</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Achis</hi> King of <hi>Gath,</hi> who gives him <hi>Ziklag</hi> for a place of surety and retreat, which he made his place of residence 16 <hi>Months,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the death of <hi>Saul;</hi> whence he made his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads on the inveterate Enemies of <hi>Israel,</hi> and always return'd laden with <hi>Booties,</hi> which <hi>Achish</hi> thought to be taken from those of <hi>Judah,</hi> 1 Sam 27.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Achish</hi> being confirmed by this Opinion which he had of <hi>David,</hi> declares to him, that he would make use of him and his Men, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thereupon a new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition is form'd by the <hi>Philistins</hi> against the <hi>Israelites. Saul,</hi> destitute of Counsel, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses himself to a <hi>Witch,</hi> to call up the Spirit of <hi>Samuel;</hi> and the <hi>Spectrum</hi> which appeared (by means of her Charms) foretels him of the Misfortune he should meet with the next Morning, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was in <hi>Anno</hi> 2944. The <hi>Armies</hi> being almost in sight of one another, <hi>David</hi> and his Men, on the Mistrust which the other <hi>Philistins</hi> conceived at him, are sent away by <hi>Achish,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But whilst <hi>Ziklag</hi> was burnt and plunder'd by the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who had carried away the <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, <hi>David</hi> in this sorrowful Accident pursues the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> overtakes them in disorder, and recovers the <hi>Persons</hi> and the <hi>Booty</hi> which they had brought away from <hi>Ziklag.</hi> He equally divides the <hi>Booty</hi> amongst the People, and returns to <hi>Ziklag,</hi> and sends Presents to his Friends in <hi>Israel,</hi> 1 Sam. 21.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Battel</hi> is given between the <hi>Philistins</hi> and <hi>Israelites;</hi> these last being beaten, <hi>Saul</hi> falls on his Sword; his 3 Sons, <hi>Jonatham, Abinadab,</hi> and <hi>Malchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah,</hi> are killed, and their Bodies with their Fathers ignominiously hang'd on the Wall of <hi>Bethshan,</hi> whence the Inhabitants of <hi>Jabesh</hi> carry them off in the Night, to the end they might have an honourable Burial, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.11. The News of this is brought to <hi>David,</hi> 2 days after his return to <hi>Ziklag,</hi> and 3 days after the <hi>Battel:</hi> He put the Messenger to death, who vaunted of his having fallen upon <hi>Saul,</hi> altho' at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:63323:321"/>
to hasten his Death; and utters a Funeral Elegy on this occasion, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have represented all this at large, to shew how much those misreckon themselves, who allow only 2 years to the Reign of <hi>Saul,</hi> seeing all the things mentioned do require a longer term. He may indeed have absolutely Reigned but 2 years after the death of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> who retain'd the dignity of a <hi>Judge</hi> all the time of his life; or that he did not Govern properly, but only the two first years, after which he was rejected of GOD, and <hi>Samuel</hi> saw him no more; but 'tis certain, many years past more since his Anointing by <hi>Samuel</hi> till his Death, of which here is an unquestionable proof. <hi>David</hi> was 30 years old when he began to Reign, and Reign'd 40, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.4. and the 2d of <hi>Saul</hi> was spending, or spent, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.1. when <hi>David</hi> was Anointed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> being the youngest of his Brethren, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.13. And when <hi>Goliah</hi> was killed, <hi>David</hi> was then but a youth; on which account also <hi>Saul</hi> durst not hope for good success in this Duel; <hi>Goliah</hi> himself likewise dispising him for this reason, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.33, 42. So that in the time of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat he must be above 22 years old; whence it evidently follows, we may reckon 10 years from the Anointing of <hi>Saul</hi> to his death; so that he Reigned at least 2 years as legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate King, the 6 following in the unjust prosecution of <hi>David</hi> till the death of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and the two last to his death.

                     <p>This <hi>War</hi> continued still above 5 years, until <hi>Abner</hi> grew offended by <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Interests and Party, sends <hi>Michal</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> he disposes the other <hi>Tribes</hi> to receive him, and comes to inform <hi>David</hi> of this at <hi>Hebron,</hi> where he is well received; but having forsaken the <hi>King, Joab</hi> and <hi>Abishai</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther basely kill him; whereat <hi>David</hi> was greatly offended, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A while after <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> is Assassinated by two of his own Captains, <hi>Rechab</hi> and <hi>Bahana,</hi> who bring his Head to <hi>David,</hi> but instead of thanking them for their Present, caused them to be put to death as Vile Fellows, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then the other <hi>Tribes</hi> resolve to acknowledge <hi>David,</hi> and hereupon wait on him at <hi>Hebron,</hi> where he had already Reigned over <hi>Judah</hi> 7 years and an half; whence he departs to seize on the Fort of <hi>Sion,</hi> and to drive the <hi>Jehusites</hi> from <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> There <hi>Hiram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre</hi> sends to him <hi>Ambassadors</hi> and <hi>Cedar-Wood,</hi> with Workmen to build his Court, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was in <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2950.</p>
                     <p>In the 9th year of his Reign he obtains 2 notable Victories over the <hi>Philistins,</hi> the first in <hi>Bahal-Peratsim,</hi> and the 2d in a place where there were a great many <hi>Mulberry-Trees,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it seems 'twas on this occasion that 3 of <hi>Davids</hi> Valiant Men went to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> for <hi>Water</hi> for him through the midst of the Enemies Forces, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.15, 16, 17.

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was blest by it, to whose house he had sent it; he made it be brought thence into <hi>Sion</hi> with great solemnity, his Wife <hi>Michal</hi> blaming him for having Danced publickly before it: he is greatly offended with her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He afterwards designs the building of the <hi>Temple,</hi> which GOD by the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> orders him to remit to his Successor, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he then prepared, or Divinely received the Model

                     <p>He beats again the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and wins them the Fort of <hi>Metheg-amma,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.1. subjugates the <hi>Moabites;</hi> and 'twas in this Expedition that <hi>Benaja</hi> slew two of the most Mighty Men amongst them, and a <hi>Lion</hi> in a Snowy day, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.30.

                     <p>It's not certain, whether the War against the <hi>Ammonites</hi> preceded that which <hi>David</hi> had against the <hi>Syrians;</hi> yet it seems the one had great Coherence with the other, of which you may see the occasion in <hi>David</hi>'s Embassy violated by <hi>Haman,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the end of it, by taking of <hi>Rabba,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Whilst <hi>Joab</hi> carried on the Siege, <hi>David</hi> commits Adultery with <hi>Bathsheba</hi> the Wife of <hi>Uriah,</hi> and procured secretly by <hi>Joab</hi> her Husbands death at the Siege of <hi>Rabba,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.1, <hi>&amp;c.

                     </p>
                     <p>This Fifth Age of the World, begins at the Foundation of the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the Year 2992; and ends at the <hi>Jewish Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Cyrus, Anno Mundi</hi> 3468; which <hi>Period</hi> contains the space of 476 years.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Temple</hi> was 7 years and an half in Building, and was Dedicated in the year 3001, which began the Fourth <hi>Millenary</hi> of the World. <hi>Solomon</hi> Reigned 40 years, and died in the year of the World 3029, being 975 years before the Birth of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> But it is incredible to think what a confusion in <hi>Chronology,</hi> is caused by the division of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> between the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> which happen'd after his Death.

but of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Asa,</hi> which had taken its birth in the separation of the <hi>Tribes,</hi> since which he found these 36 years: For <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> had Reigned 17, and <hi>Ahijam</hi> 3, and <hi>Asa</hi> 15 or 16, when <hi>Baasha</hi> openly invaded him.

This Contest having lasted about 4 years, he began to Reign absolutely without any Controuler: As the 33th year of <hi>Asa</hi> ended, and continued 8 years; having transferr'd the Royal Seat from <hi>Tirzah</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> which he built; and having bought the Ground of <hi>Shemer,</hi> who was Lord thereof: So that the 12 years that are attributed to him must be reckoned not from the death of <hi>Tibni,</hi> but from that of <hi>Elah,</hi> for the revenge of which he had been Tumultuously declared King, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He left <hi>Ahab</hi> his Son Successor to the Crown of <hi>Israel</hi> in the 38th year of <hi>Ahab.</hi> He was a wicked Prince, doing great mischief, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.29, <hi>&amp;c.

                     <p>Those who allow only 2 years to <hi>Evilme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodac,</hi> speak without grounds, and seem to contradict the <hi>Scripture,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.29, 30. and this way of speaking that <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> being by <hi>Evilmerodac</hi> set at liberty, on the 27th day of the 12th Month, as expired either the year 37 of the Captivity, or the

1st of <hi>Evilmerodac,</hi> and eat with him, and was fed by him all the time of his life, doth methinks express a longer time than a year or 2; and therefore some of the Ancients attribute to <hi>Evilmerodac</hi> 18 years Reign, and others 12.

                     <p>Let us then, without defining the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular time of the Reign of these 3, of which the <hi>Scripture</hi> is silent, allow them together the 33 years in question.

And therefore neither does he speak of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazar,</hi> as a Youth, who came now from losing his pretended Father <hi>Neriglissar,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whose Tutelage he had lived; (this great Festival which he celebrated would have been little agreeable to the year of Mourning) but he speaks of him as a perfect Man, who Feasts not only his <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> but likewise his <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Concubines,</hi> Dan 5.2. and distinctly recites those Visions he had in the first year of <hi>Belshazar, Dan.</hi> 7.1. and in the 3d, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.1. which he could not say, had <hi>Belshazar</hi> Reigned only 9 Months. I would give then 20 or 25 years to <hi>Evilme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodac,</hi> and to <hi>Belshazar</hi> his Son, and the rest to <hi>Darius,</hi> Subrogat to <hi>Belshazar,</hi> after he had been killed by the Conspiracy of his own, in the Night of his Sacrilegious Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, in the which the end of a Mystical Hand, by a Writing which <hi>Daniel</hi> alone could read and expound, had denounced to him his ruin, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.30. so that still the last year of this <hi>Darius,</hi> who is the same that Writers have call'd <hi>Nabonides</hi> and <hi>Labonules,</hi> as they name <hi>Belshazar, Labosoarchodes,</hi> will fall in with the first of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the last of the Captivity.</p>
                     <p>He was not King of <hi>Media,</hi> but of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> as may be seen <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.31. and 9.1. and he is surnamed of <hi>Mede,</hi> not so much for having liv'd amongst the <hi>Medes,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was an originary, and that <hi>Ahasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus</hi> his Father, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.1. is the same, who is termed by the other Greeks <hi>Cyaxares</hi> (Father of <hi>Astyages,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father) who being King of <hi>Mede</hi> joyned his Arms to those of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> for the taking of <hi>Niniveth,</hi> and the suppression of the <hi>Assyrians;</hi> for as <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> had espous'd <hi>Nitocris,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and Sister of <hi>Astyages,</hi> so it seems he brought into his Court this <hi>Darius,</hi> his Wives Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that he there lived in great Credit, seeing he was 62 years of Age, when he was substituted to <hi>Belshazar,</hi> by the Faction of those who Assassinated him, and of whom perhaps he was the Chief, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.31. And this was the first step of what <hi>GOD</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to him, that his Kingdom should be divided, and given to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians, Dan.</hi> 5.28. seeing that this Person being originary of <hi>Mede,</hi> possest it after him, and settled the Government of it on the Platform of what was practis'd by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> lately re-united under the Government of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (after the death of <hi>Astyages</hi> his Grandfather) as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd from <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.1, 8, 12, 15.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> in favouring <hi>Daniel,</hi> and establishing him one of the <hi>Triumvirs,</hi> who presided over the 120 <hi>Satrapes</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> which at his coming to the Crown he had established over all the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to share his Authority with those from whose Suffrage he had received it, expos'd him to the envy and hatred of all others, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by a wicked and cruel Edict, to make him be thrown into a Den of <hi>Lions,</hi> where he was miraculously preserved, to the great Joy of the King, and the confusion of his Enemies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As <hi>Daniel</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Belshazer,</hi> the first and the 3d year of his Reign, the <hi>Visions</hi> he describes in the 7th and 8th Chapters of his Book; so hapned under <hi>Darius</hi> of <hi>Mede,</hi> in the first year of his Reign, what he did and saw in the 9th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Some few years after, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was mentioned by the name, almost 2 Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, to be the Deliverer of the

                        <p>As from the Foundation of the <hi>Temple</hi> (Laid in the Year of the <hi>World 2988</hi>) we reckon about <hi>482</hi> Years; so from the Taking of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Ending of the <hi>Captivity,</hi> to the Death of our <hi>Saviour JESUS CHRIST,</hi> there are (according to some) <hi>490</hi> Years, and (to others) <hi>74</hi> Years more, and again (according to others) <hi>13</hi> Years more.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>ANno Mundi</hi> 3470. DANIEL, who had been till then <hi>Darius</hi> Favourite, and remained in this quality in the Capital City, insinuated himself so prudently into the Favour of the Conqueror (by the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of <hi>GOD</hi>) that he continu'd to him the same Employs he had under <hi>Darius,</hi> Dan. 6.28. And there's great likelihood 'twas at the <hi>Prophets</hi> perswasion (who without doubt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to him the Predictions of <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi>) that he published in favour of the <hi>Jews</hi> the Edict of their Liberty, from the 1st year of the taking of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Monarchies submission to the Diadem of the <hi>Persians,</hi> 2 Chron. 36.22. <hi>Esdr.</hi> 1.1. in the year of the World 3470. Some Learned Men begin here the 70 Weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and end them at the Death of the <hi>Son of GOD,</hi> Dan. 9.24. as if <hi>GOD</hi> would have had the <hi>Septenary</hi> of the Servitude to be followed by another <hi>Septenary,</hi> which should bring us in the Death of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the true <hi>Messias,</hi> the Liberty of our <hi>Souls.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> seem in some sort to favour this Sentiment, seeing they make their 2d <hi>Temple</hi> to subsist but 420 years; and it's apparent, 'twas overthrown by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasian,</hi> in the 70th or 72d year after the Birth of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> But others, to adjust the <hi>Holy Chronology</hi> with Foreign Accounts (altho they be in several chief Points uncertain, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in what concerns the <hi>Persian Monarchy</hi>) they hold one must descend lower, and begin the account of 70 <hi>Weeks</hi> in the 7th of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> in which <hi>Esdras</hi> came into <hi>Judea</hi> with ample Commission, to set the Republick in order, <hi>Esdr.</hi> 7.7. or what appears more agreeing with the 20th, in which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> obtain'd the Office of Governor, and the Authority of rebuilding the <hi>Walls</hi> and <hi>Streets</hi> of the Town, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.1. Others have moreover on this Subject, Sentiments less reasonable than the preceeding, the last of which is prefixable to all the rest: We intend not to enter into the discussion of these <hi>Chronological Punctilio's,</hi> in which one may sooner guess at, than demonstrate things.</p>
                     <p>After the Edict of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was published, <hi>Zorobabel</hi> the Son of <hi>Salathiel,</hi> of the Royal Family, called otherwise <hi>Shesbat-shar</hi> by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> Esdr. 1.8. and <hi>Attirshatta,</hi> which is the Governour for the King, in respect of his Dignity, <hi>Esdr.</hi> 2.63. compared with <hi>Esdr.</hi> 3.2. and <hi>Joshuah</hi> the <hi>High Priest</hi> the Son of <hi>Jozadock,</hi> and <hi>Sherajah</hi>'s Grandson, who was executed with <hi>Zedekias,</hi> laden with the <hi>Sacred Vessels,</hi> which he caused to be restored, with a great number of persons specified, <hi>Esdr.</hi> Chap. 2. and <hi>Nehem.</hi> Chap. 7. arriv'd in <hi>Judea</hi> in the 2d year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a while before the 7 Months, and set to rebuilding the <hi>Altar,</hi> and offering their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> Esdr. 3.1. In the following year they laid the Foundations of the <hi>Temple,</hi> Esdr. 3.8. But they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately met with opposition, by the Credit which their Enemies found at Court, whence it came that <hi>Cambyses (Cyrus</hi> his Son, who
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:63323:329"/>
was employ'd afar off in the Expedition against Queen <hi>Tomyris</hi>) favour'd them not. And this was the cause of the Fasting and Prayers of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the 3d year of <hi>Cyrus, Dan.</hi> 10.1. But the <hi>Prophet</hi> died a while after the last <hi>Vision</hi> which he had, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the words of the <hi>Angel,</hi> and in ending it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.13.</p>
                     <p>This opposition continu'd under the Reign of <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> and more violently under that of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as is seen <hi>Esdr.</hi> 4.6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as these 2 Names seem to have been common to the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Mede,</hi> (compared <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Esther</hi> 1.1. and <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.1.) yet it seems we should understand by this <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> the Son and Successor of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom the generality of <hi>Historians</hi> have called <hi>Cambyses,</hi> who was found the Heir of his Scepter 3 or 4 years after the taking of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Reigned 7 or 8 years; and by <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who followed him. This Impostor who would pass for <hi>Smerdis, Cyrus</hi> his 2d Son, whom the eldest had put to death; for his Imposture having been discover'd, and he punish'd, <hi>Darius Histaspis</hi> came to the Crown, and the <hi>Jews</hi> seeing him settled, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over considering, that tho <hi>Cambyses</hi> (preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd by his Flatterers) had conniv'd at their Oppression, without confirming the Edict which his Father had publish'd in their favour, yet there was no contrary and prohibited one, other than that of the false <hi>Smerdis,</hi> who is the first <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> of the Scripture, and that he not having been lawful King, the Prohibition he had made of Rebuilding was of no validity; they therefore took Courage at the sollicitation of the Prophets <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zacchary,</hi> and set to work in the 2d year of <hi>Darius,</hi> Esdr. 4.24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.1. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Zac.</hi> 1.1. And <hi>Darius</hi> having chang'd the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Crown on this side <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and substituted to <hi>Bishlam, Metredath, Rehum, &amp;c.</hi> who in the time of <hi>Cambyses,</hi> and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor <hi>Smerdis,</hi> had so hotly oppos'd the Building of the Temple, <hi>Tattenas, Shether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boznai, &amp;c.</hi> who were more moderate, <hi>Esdr.</hi> 5.3. They seeing this work advanced, came to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to inform themselves on the Spot; hear from <hi>Zorobabel</hi> and <hi>Joshuah,</hi> the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they had from the Edict of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and made a faithful Report by their Letters to <hi>Darius,</hi> entreating him to inform himself of the Truth of the matter, and to send his Commands, touching what he would have them to do in this Point, <hi>Esdr.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On these <hi>Letters Darius</hi> caus'd Search to be made in the <hi>Archives</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> for what might concern this Order of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and finding the Writing, he confirmed it by a 2d Edict, more careful to maintain the Will of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whose Daughter he had espous'd than had been <hi>Cambyses</hi> his own Son, <hi>Esdr.</hi> 6.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus was finished the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the Dedication of it was celebrated, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Worship in it in the 6th year of King <hi>Darius, Esdr.</hi> 6.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be alledged, That according to this reckoning the interruption of this <hi>Temple</hi> must have lasted no more than 10 or 12 years at most, whereas 'tis said (<hi>John</hi> 2.20.) it had been 46 years in Building; one may answer, either that the <hi>Jews</hi> said this at a venture, without any certain information; or that they misreckon'd the time employ'd by <hi>Zorobabel</hi> in this Work; or that in giving moreover a year or two to the Life of <hi>Cyrus</hi> since the Work began, 7 to <hi>Cambyses,</hi> 1 to the Impostor <hi>Smerdis,</hi> and 36 to <hi>Darius,</hi> they find precisely these 46 years between the 2d of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in which the <hi>Jews</hi> return'd from <hi>Babylon</hi> had follow'd this design, and the last of <hi>Darius,</hi> their second Benefactor, under whom the Work was again undertaken and finished.</p>
                     <p>It seems that <hi>Darius,</hi> since the <hi>Temple</hi> was finish'd, took no more care of the Interest of the <hi>Jews;</hi> whether he was otherwise employ'd in continual Wars; or whether he thought it was sufficient the <hi>Temple</hi> was built, tho the Walls were not raised.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>Darius,</hi> after a Reign of 36 years which is commonly given him, his Son <hi>Xerxes</hi> succeeded, who was born to him by <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Daughter: It's he who is indicated <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.2. and of whom is mention <hi>Esther</hi> 1.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He repudiated <hi>Vashti,</hi> espouses <hi>Esther</hi> in her place, takes <hi>Haman</hi> into favour, who vex'd at <hi>Mordecai</hi> for his refusal to bow to him, took a design, not only of destroying him, but at one and the same time all the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were to be found in the Empire; but the King having read the publick Registers, and the signal Service which <hi>Mordecai</hi> had rendred him, would have him worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd by the very hands of his great Favourite; who as he was just on the point of oppressing the <hi>Jews, Esther</hi> opposes her self with such success, by the Counsel of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> that all the mischief which this infolent Favourite had prepared against him,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:63323:329"/>
fell on his own Head, and turn'd to the shameful ruin of himself and his Family. As <hi>Mordecai (Esthers</hi> Uncle) is without doubt another, than he who came up from <hi>Chaldea</hi> with <hi>Zorobabel</hi> and <hi>Jeshuah,</hi> Esdr. 2.2. and <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7.7. so what is said <hi>Esther</hi> 2.6. that he had been transported with the King <hi>Jecho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,</hi> is not to be understood of his Person, but of that of his Father or Grandfather: But in supposing he was transported in the Reigns of his Father, or Grandfather, and born towards the end of the Captivity; or after 'twas ended; here will be no longer diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                     <p>Those who collect the History of <hi>Esther</hi> as far as <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> or <hi>Darius Ochus,</hi> increase this Difficulty; and those who terminate it in <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> do disingage themselves little better. Those who understand it of <hi>Cambyses</hi> are contradicted, because 'twas the 7th year of <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> when he espoused <hi>Esther,</hi> and <hi>Cambyses</hi> scarcely past over the 7th of his Reign, having moreover been a constant <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation to his death; and those who would understand the <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> of <hi>Esther,</hi> of <hi>Cyaxaris,</hi> who was the Father of <hi>Darius</hi> of <hi>Mede,</hi> cannot attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to him the magnificence and extent of the Empire, describ'd <hi>Esther,</hi> Chap. 1. beside, that he was not King of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zorobabel</hi> and <hi>Jeshuah,</hi> who had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the People from <hi>Cyrus</hi> this year, died, apparently under the Reign of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and by their decease left their new springing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick in very bad order; to speak humanly, there cannot be given more than 60 years in their Administration, and in giving moreover 4 to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> after the taking of <hi>Babylon,</hi> 7 to <hi>Cambyses,</hi> 1 to the Impostor, and 36 to <hi>Darius,</hi> according to the common Reckoning, they must have liv'd no farther than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> to whom there are alloted 21; at the end of which succeeds his Son <hi>Artaxerxes Longemain,</hi> that is, <hi>Long-hand,</hi> who is made to have worn the Crown 40, or 41 years.

                     <p>It appears, that in the time of <hi>Esdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah, Joakim</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeshua</hi> exercised the <hi>High Priesthood,</hi> Nehem. 12.26, but it seems he died a while after the arrival of <hi>Esdras,</hi> seeing <hi>Eliashib</hi> his Son was already in this Dignity, when the <hi>Walls</hi> of the Town were rebuilt, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 3.1, <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.</p>

This <hi>Alexander,</hi> who is called by <hi>Daniel</hi> the King of <hi>Javan,</hi> Dan. 8.21. and 10.20. outlived <hi>Darius</hi> by 6 years, and his Kingdom was divided to 4 Strangers: <hi>Seleucus</hi> had great <hi>Asia</hi> towards the North for his part; <hi>Ptolomy, Egypt</hi> towards the South; <hi>Antigonus, Asia Minor</hi> to the East; and <hi>Cassander, Macedonia</hi> towards the West, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.6. and 8.8. and 23. and 11.4.

                     <p>We have pursued the Series of these things the longer, not to place these <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> nor the History of <hi>Josephus,</hi> in the rank of <hi>Canonical Books;</hi> but because they serve to shew the fulfilling of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniels</hi> predictions.

                     <p>To <hi>John,</hi> after he had sustained 30 years this double Dignity, succeeded the first in one and the other <hi>Aristobulus</hi> his Son, who kept it but a year, having dethron'd his Mother, and privately put to death his Brother <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus.</hi>

                     <p>His younger Brother <hi>Alexander Jammeus</hi> succeeds him, and Rules 27 years: He was engaged in several Wars, as well domestick as foreign; the latter against <hi>Ptolomy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurus,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and died, having been troubled for 3 years together with a <hi>Quartan Ague.</hi> He left 2 Sons after him, <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus;</hi> but <hi>Alexandra</hi> their Mother governed by the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> possest her self of the Crown, and obliged the Eldest to content himself with the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> continuing in this Authority the space of 9 years.</p>
                     <p>After her death <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> who has only 6 years assigned him, takes her place, and deprives <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> his Eldest Brother of the <hi>Priesthood.

                     <p>After several Domestick Intrigues, in which the Ambition, Fraud and Cruelty of <hi>Herod</hi> every day signalized themselves, and the Suits he had before <hi>Anthony</hi> with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> followed the Battle of <hi>Actium,</hi> and the death of these two, whereupon he puts to death the old <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> who seemed an Eye-sore to him, comes to <hi>Augustus</hi> victorious, and is well received by him, and obtains the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his Authority, and assurance of his Amity: being returned home, he puts to death his Wife <hi>Mariamne,</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andra</hi> his Mother in Law, prejudiced by Calumnies against them; obliges his Sister <hi>Salomas</hi> to give a Bill of Divorce to <hi>Costobar</hi> her Husband; rebuilds <hi>Samaria,</hi> which he calls <hi>Sebastia</hi> in honour of <hi>Augustus,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalizes himself by several other Buildings; relieves the People in Famine; espouses the Daughter of <hi>Simon Boetius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and taking the <hi>High Priesthood</hi> from <hi>Jesus-Phabetis,</hi> who had held it six Years after <hi>Ananel,</hi> confers it on his Father in Law; prejudiced by Calumnies and Suspicions, he put his two Sons to death, <hi>Aristobulus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> which he had of <hi>Mariamne;</hi> sets a <hi>Golden Eagle</hi> on the Gate of the <hi>Temple,</hi> to the great scandal of the whole Nation, and makes not only his own dwelling, but the whole Country a <hi>Charnel-House.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Which contains the History of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> from the Birth of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ANno Christi,</hi> Altho the Spirit of <hi>GOD</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes us with considerable Marks, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.1, 2. and 3.1, 23. to denote to us almost the exact time of the coming of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> into the <hi>World;</hi> yet it seems to have in this particular bridled our too great Curiosity, in telling us that in the 15th year of the Reign of <hi>Tiberius, &amp;c.</hi> he was about 30 years of Age. Yet from hence is gathered, he must have been born about 15 years before the death of <hi>Augustus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Prince</hi> (according to <hi>Suetonius</hi>) lived about 76 years; at the Age of 20 he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Succession of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, killed in the Senate by <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius;</hi> to revenge his death, he associates <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and thus formed the <hi>Trumviracy,</hi> which lasted about 12 years, after which it terminated in the death of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> he Reigned moreover 44 years. Yet <hi>Chronologists</hi> begins the years of <hi>Augustus</hi> in the Empire by the death of his Uncle; and thus we must fix the Birth of the Son of <hi>GOD,</hi> to the end of the 41st year of <hi>Augustus,</hi> or at the beginning of the 42d.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> of the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Rank, the Son of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ordained for a Fore-runner to our <hi>Lord,</hi> was born 6 Months before him, it being already 6 Months since his Mother was big of him, when the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> declared to the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> the Conception of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> Luke 1.36. She dwelt at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a Town of <hi>Gallilee,</hi> and was betrothed to <hi>Joseph</hi> when the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Messenger brought her this great News. And a while after, by the secret instinct of the Spirit of <hi>GOD,</hi> she went to visit her Cousin S. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Luke 1.39, which served to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them both in the Faith of this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
                     <p>Whilst the consummation of the <hi>Marriage</hi> is deferred by the secret Order and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>GOD,</hi> which made innocent Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to arise, such as might be the Journy of the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Joseph</hi> perceiving her pregnancy, resolved to disingage himself from her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noise; but he was divinely hindred by an <hi>Angel,</hi> Matt. 1.18, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time comes the Edict of <hi>Augustus,</hi> to make the recension and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all the Subjects of the <hi>Empire,</hi> to know the Forces of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.1. It seems that <hi>Cyrenius,</hi> as he is named, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.2. that is <hi>Quirinus,</hi> was sent into <hi>Syria</hi> with an extraordinary Commission for this descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whilst that <hi>Saturninus</hi> was called home, and that <hi>Q. Varus</hi> had succeeded him. Now to proceed to this description in an orderly manner, every one was obliged to render himself in his Town and Country; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> had their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> they were obliged to go to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to be Enrolled in the City of <hi>David,</hi> because both how mean soever and low their condition was then, drew their original from this great <hi>King,</hi> as appears from the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies which we have of <hi>Jesus Christ, Matt.</hi> Chap. 1. and <hi>Luke</hi> Chap. 3.</p>
                     <p>Being arrived at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> they found all places of Entertainment so full, that they were forced to lodge in a <hi>Stable,</hi> where the hour and pains of Childbirth seizing on the Holy <hi>Virgin,</hi> she was happily delivered of this <hi>Holy Child, God-Man,</hi> wrapping him up in poor Cloaths, in the best manner she could in this surprize, strengthened by a particular assistance of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and laid him in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.6, 7.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Nativity</hi> was immediately declared by an <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>Shepherds,</hi> who watch their <hi>Flocks</hi> in the Night; and a Multitude of the <hi>Heavenly Choir,</hi> made at the same time, the Air resounds with <hi>Canticles</hi> of <hi>Praise</hi> on this occasion. These <hi>Shepherds</hi> come to see at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> what had hapned, and publish the News thereof to their Neighbours, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> has not mark'd the Day or Month of our <hi>LORD</hi>'s Birth; but held to be on the 25th of <hi>December:</hi> Eight days after his <hi>Birth,</hi> He is <hi>Circumcised</hi> according

to the Law, and called JESUS, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.21. A while after <hi>Wise-Men,</hi> called <hi>Magi</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> being warned of this <hi>Birth</hi> by a miraculous <hi>Star,</hi> come from the East of <hi>Judea,</hi> and rather from <hi>Arabia,</hi> than <hi>Persia,</hi> to inform themselves at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> of the place where the King of the <hi>Jews</hi> was born. Their Demand and Enquiry put them in trouble, and filled the mind of <hi>Herod</hi> with disquiet, to whose Ambition every thing gave place. Being instructed by the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> of the place mark'd in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> for the <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Messias,</hi> he sends these Strangers into <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> with a strict charge to bring him exact Information of their Discoveries, pretending also, that he would go and worship him. They setting forth at Night for <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> see the same <hi>Meteorick Star</hi> (for it was not an <hi>Aethereal</hi>) which they had seen in their Country, which led them directly to the Place where <hi>Jesus</hi> lay, stopping its course on the House; where being entred, they find the <hi>Mother</hi> and the <hi>Child,</hi> whom they Religiously worship, and draw forth <hi>Gold, Myrrh,</hi> and <hi>Frankincense,</hi> which they brought with them to present him; and being warn'd from <hi>GOD,</hi> not to return towards <hi>Herod,</hi> they withdrew another way, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is what the <hi>Holy History</hi> teaches us; those who affirm, they were but Three, and make Kings of them, have spoken without Book, as well as those who make them to arrive at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> the sixth of <hi>January,</hi> and 13 days after our <hi>Saviour's Nativity.</hi> So the Feast of the <hi>Epiphany</hi> was celebrated anciently in remembrance, either of the <hi>Conception,</hi> or of the <hi>Birth</hi> or <hi>Baptism</hi> of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> and not on the occasion of the Arrival of these <hi>Magies.</hi> It's far more probable, they came not into <hi>Judea</hi> till about 5 Weeks after the <hi>Birth</hi> of our <hi>LORD;</hi> and that a few days after they parted from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the term of the <hi>Mother</hi>'s <hi>Purification,</hi> and Presentation of her <hi>Son</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi> being laps'd, <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ascended up with the Child to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to satisfy the Ordinances of the Law, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.22, 23, 24. There <hi>Simeon</hi> comes to meet and embrace him in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> the <hi>Prophetess</hi> meets them at the same instant; and as he (before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) joyfully disposes himself for death, having seen the <hi>LORD Christ,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promise he had; so she spake of it to all them, whom she knew expected Deliverance at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Luke 2.25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilst these things past in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> (who hatch'd a detestable Design against the LORD's <hi>Life</hi>) expects in vain the Return of the <hi>Wise-Men,</hi> to execute it with greater Secrecy: <hi>Joseph</hi> is advertiz'd from <hi>Heaven,</hi> not to bring back the Child to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but to carry him with his <hi>Mother</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there to tarry till further Order, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.13, 14. It was at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> that this Command was given <hi>Joseph,</hi> and thereupon he immediately sets forth; so that S. <hi>Luke</hi> making him return to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> after what had hapned in the <hi>Temple,</hi> Luke 2.39. must be supplied from St <hi>Matthew,</hi> to understand that he return'd not into <hi>Galilee,</hi> till he had executed what was prescrib'd by <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which he received to fly into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as a place of shelter against <hi>Herod</hi>'s Designs: For <hi>Herod</hi> finding himself deceived by the <hi>Wise Men,</hi> resolved to use the <hi>Lyons Claw,</hi> where the <hi>Foxes Skin</hi> had served to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and therefore he sends Officers to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> who make diligent search in all Houses of this <hi>Town,</hi> and adjacent places, and kill the <hi>Male Children</hi> which they could find, from 2 years old and upwards, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was not two years since this <hi>Star</hi> had appeared to the <hi>Wise Men,</hi> and they had not been two years in the way; but <hi>Herod</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Child</hi> might have been born before the <hi>Wise Men</hi> had observed the <hi>Star,</hi> and determined to take the surest Measures, he took therefore a larger compass, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to Death all those who might have been Born since two years, to the time in which the <hi>Wise Men</hi> were arrived at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and had carefully informed himself of them. And thus, if any <hi>Children</hi> were spared, it were only those who were new Born, seeing few days slipt between his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and his cruel Execution.</p>
                     <p>A while after, and in the same year in which <hi>JESUS</hi> was Born, <hi>Herod</hi> falls sick of the filthy and troublesome <hi>Disease,</hi> called <hi>Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> with which he dies. By the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Antipater,</hi> the eldest of his Sons, he had put to Death <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> whom he had of <hi>Mariamne;</hi> but <hi>Antipater,</hi> impatient at his Father's living so long, began to Conspire against him, and resolved
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:63323:334"/>
on Poysoning him. He formed this Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with his Unkle <hi>Pheroras, Herod</hi>'s Brother, whose Wife was much irritated against her Brother in Law in favour of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> a great number of whom <hi>Herod</hi> had put to death, and Condemn'd the rest to great <hi>Fines;</hi> for finding himself hated by the <hi>People</hi> for his Avarice and Cruelty, he had extorted from them a new <hi>Oath,</hi> which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had refused, promising to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others, on certain Revelations which they pretended, the <hi>Crown</hi> should be taken from him, and his Brother <hi>Pheroras</hi> should wear it. <hi>Antipater,</hi> the better to carry on his design, procur'd by his Friends to be sent to <hi>Rome;</hi> but <hi>Pheroras</hi> surpriz'd by <hi>Sickness,</hi> repents of this design and dies. <hi>Herod</hi> suspects his Sister-in-Law to have poysoned her Husband, and in making an exact Inquisition, he finds the Poyson was design'd against him, by the Conspiracy of <hi>Antipater.</hi> He sends for him from <hi>Rome,</hi> accuses him of <hi>Parricide,</hi> and throws him into Prison, in expectation of <hi>Augustus</hi> his Sentence. Things were in this state when the <hi>Little Children</hi> were murthered, which Fact being related to <hi>Augustus,</hi> employed in a second Process of the Father against the Son, made him utter this saying, cited in <hi>Macrobius) That 'twere better to be</hi> Herod<hi>'s Hog than his Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This wretched <hi>Tyrant,</hi> laden with Crimes, Vexation, and Years, being about 70, takes his Bed, and tho desperately ill, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in his ordinary Cruelty. Two famous Men, <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Matthias,</hi> Doctors of the Law seeing him in a condition not like to recover, had perswaded their <hi>Disciples</hi> to beat down the <hi>Golden Eagle,</hi> which he set over the Gate of the <hi>Temple</hi> in honour of <hi>Augustus;</hi> but he caused most part of them to be burnt at <hi>Jerico,</hi> where he had caused them to be brought: He also shut up in the <hi>Hypodrom,</hi> the Principal Persons of the <hi>Jewish Nation,</hi> with Order, that they should be knock'd on the Head, as soon as he was dead, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might have cause to lament at his death, tho not for it. And having known, that <hi>Antipater</hi> (on a false Rumour which was spread in the <hi>Palace</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he was dead, when he called for a <hi>Knife</hi> to pare an <hi>Apple,</hi> and had attempted to kill himself with it, and began to treat with the <hi>Goaler</hi> about his Liberty, he puts him to death, and died himself 5 days after, having Reigned (according to <hi>Josephus,</hi> who relates all these things at length) 37 Years since he had obtained at <hi>Rome</hi> the Title of <hi>King,</hi> and 34 since <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the last of the <hi>Asmoneans</hi> was dead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 2. <hi>Herod</hi> being dead, <hi>Joseph</hi> had notice from Heaven thereof in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and receives Order to return home; but having understood, that <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Son Reigned in his stead, he retired into <hi>Galilee, Matth.</hi> 2.20, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herod,</hi> a while before his death had altered his Will, and by a preceeding, he made <hi>Herod-Antipas</hi> his Successor of the <hi>Crown;</hi> but in the last he appointed <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Successor and King of <hi>Judea,</hi> with reference to the good liking of <hi>Augustus. Archelaus</hi> being arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> to be confirmed in his Dignity, found there great opposition, as well from the part of <hi>Herod-Antipas</hi> as from all the Nation, who would have no more Kings. And <hi>Augustus</hi> having heard the Parties, and the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ambassadors, to the number of fifty, assisted by 8000 other <hi>Jews</hi> residing at <hi>Rome,</hi> who formed weighty Accusations against <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and desired, That their Country might be govern'd as a <hi>Province,</hi> and not as a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> assign'd <hi>Judea, Idumea,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Ethnare,</hi> that is, less than that of a King; but with Promise to obtain that, if he made himself worthy, though the <hi>Jews</hi> made no difference between these two Names: But <hi>Philip</hi> his Brother was made <hi>Tetrarch</hi> of <hi>Ituria</hi> and <hi>Trachonia</hi> and <hi>Herod-Antipas</hi> was of <hi>Gallilee, Luke</hi> 3.1.</p>
                     <p>While these things past at <hi>Rome,</hi> and moreover, an Impostor would pass for <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Son of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Mariamne,</hi> whom the Father had put to death; <hi>Judea</hi> was vext with divers <hi>Seditions,</hi> and greatly disturbed by the Incursions and Pillagings of this <hi>Theudas,</hi> or <hi>Judas,</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 5.36. He was the Son of one <hi>Ezekias,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Banditi,</hi> who had heretofore given much Trouble to <hi>Herod. Archelaus</hi> returned into <hi>Judea,</hi> takes away the <hi>High Priesthood</hi> from <hi>Joazar,</hi> and places <hi>Eleazer</hi> his Brother in his room. These two were the Sons of <hi>Simon Boethius,</hi> whom <hi>Herod</hi> (who had espoused his Daughter) had promoted to this Dignity; but had since deprived him of it, in putting to death his Wife, who had conspired against his Life, and had subsituted to him <hi>Matthias</hi>
                        <pb n="399" facs="tcp:63323:334"/>
the Son of <hi>Theophilus;</hi> but a while before his death he had deposed <hi>Matthias,</hi> accusing him for having connived at the beating down of the <hi>Golden Eagle,</hi> and put this <hi>Joazer</hi> in his place; but <hi>Eleazer</hi> was since dispossest by <hi>Joazer,</hi> who took his Rank when <hi>Archelaus</hi> was banisht. The principal Persons of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> impatient at the rude Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they received from <hi>Archelaus,</hi> put in an Accusation at <hi>Rome</hi> against him, in process of which he is dispoiled of his Dignity 10 years after he had obtained it, being banisht to <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> all his Estate confiscated, and his Country reduced in form of a <hi>Province,</hi> and joyned to <hi>Syria,</hi> where <hi>Quirinus</hi> is sent Governour, and charged with the sale of <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s Goods, of a second description; and 'tis in respect of this second, that that under which our <hi>Saviour</hi> was born is called the first, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.2.</p>
                     <p>In the time of this second description, <hi>Judas</hi> the <hi>Galilean</hi> interpreting it <hi>Servitude,</hi> and pretending that the Title of <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> belonged only to <hi>GOD,</hi> he drew great store of <hi>People</hi> after him, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.27. In the preceeding Verse there is also mention of one <hi>Thudas,</hi> a Ring-leader of <hi>Sedition,</hi> who must have appeared in the time of <hi>Augustus,</hi> or <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and must not be confounded with another of the like Name, who arose since, under <hi>Claudius</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and after the death of <hi>Herod-Agrippa,</hi> of whom speaks <hi>Josephus, lib.</hi> 20. <hi>of the Antiquity of the Jews,</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>Quirinus</hi> having ended his Recension, left <hi>Coponius</hi> as Procurator of <hi>Augustus</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> to order affairs there. Then also <hi>Joazer</hi> is deposed from the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> and <hi>Ananus,</hi> or <hi>Annas</hi> (the Father-in-Law of <hi>Caiphas</hi>) is substituted in his room; and these two exercise alternately the Charge, until our <hi>LORD</hi>'s Death, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.2. tho not so constantly, but that they left the place sometimes to a Third, as may be verified out of <hi>Josephus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 12. Then our <hi>Saviour</hi> at the age of 12. years was led by <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where they lived, to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Passover,</hi> where he stayed unknown to them 3 days; at the end of which they found him in the <hi>Temple,</hi> sitting or standing in the midst of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> hearing and asking Questions, to the admiration of all, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.40, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Sacred Records denoting only this of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our <hi>Saviour</hi> did, and whatever hapned to him at his <hi>Baptism;</hi> only that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> he was subject to <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> applying himself to the labours of a <hi>Carpenter,</hi> and eating his Bread with the sweat of his Brows, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.51. (for we have no reason to amuse with <hi>Apochryphal Writings</hi>) we shall therefore pass lightly over the things that hapned in the World, during the 18 years which slipt, till he was manifested in <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. We may refer to the 13th year of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> what was done by the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where being secretly entred, and by Night (during the Feast of the <hi>Passover</hi>) they sprinkled it with dead Bones, to defile it. In the 14th year <hi>Augustus</hi> sends for Successor to <hi>Coponius,</hi> in the Office of Procurator of <hi>Judea, Marc Ambivius,</hi> who remained there but a while; for immediately <hi>Annius Rufus</hi> was substituted in his place. In the 15th year expiring, or the 16th be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <hi>Augustus</hi> dies at <hi>Nola,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> succeeds him, who from the 2d year of his Empire, in the 17th year of <hi>Christ,</hi> sends for Successor to <hi>Annius Rufus</hi> in <hi>Judea, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Gratus,</hi> who continued in this Office 11 years; during this time he made divers changes in the <hi>Priesthood;</hi> for first, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived <hi>Annas</hi> of it, to confer it on <hi>Ishmael</hi> the Son of <hi>Fabius,</hi> whom he displaced a while after, substituting <hi>Eleazar</hi> to him, the Son of <hi>Annas;</hi> but at the years end, deposes <hi>Eleazer,</hi> and puts <hi>Simon</hi> the Son of <hi>Comith</hi> in his place; and at the end of a year, <hi>Joseph,</hi> surnamed <hi>Caiphas (Annas</hi> Son in-Law) succeeds him; so that we must not wonder if the <hi>Gospel</hi> speaks often of <hi>Chief Priests</hi> in the Plural, because the <hi>Romans</hi> made this Dignity not only Ambulatory, but also Annual, and sometimes shared it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Persons, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.2. About this time <hi>Tiberius</hi> made the <hi>Jews</hi> be expelled <hi>Rome,</hi> because <hi>Fulvia,</hi> Wife to <hi>Saturninus,</hi> having embraced <hi>Judaism,</hi> and 4 vile Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, who pretended to be <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> having persuaded her to send for an <hi>Offering</hi> to the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem, Purple</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> they had applied (by a horrid Sacriledge) these Oblations to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar use. Then also 4000 <hi>Jews,</hi> who had been freed from Servitude, were sent from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Samaria,</hi> to oppose the <hi>Thieves</hi> there; the <hi>Senate</hi> esteeming there would be little loss,

if the bad Air killed most part of them.</p>

                        <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 28, 30. <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> at the end of 11 Years succeeds <hi>Valerius Gratus;</hi> and about two Years after, in the 15th of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> S. <hi>John Baptist</hi> begins his Ministry, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.1.

It was in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Jordan,</hi> in a place called <hi>Bethabara,</hi> as who would say, <hi>The House of Passage,</hi> John 1.28. and which is thought to be the same place by which the <hi>Israelites</hi> (under the Conduct of <hi>Joshuah</hi>) entred into the Land of <hi>Canaan, Joshuah</hi> 3.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Those who pretend, that S. <hi>John Baptist</hi> attended his Ministry some years before the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> will be hard put to it, to find in <hi>Scripture</hi> grounds for their Opinion; but being older than our <hi>LORD</hi> by 6 <hi>Months,</hi> 'tis to be presumed he had been already 5 or 6 <hi>Months</hi> employed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his Office, before our <hi>LORD</hi> was by his <hi>Baptism</hi> solemnly inaugurated into his.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Preachings</hi> were full of <hi>Spirit,</hi> tho he confirm'd them by no Miracle, <hi>John</hi> 10.41. his <hi>Censures</hi> sharp, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.7. his <hi>Instructions</hi> weighty and pertinent to every condition, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he especially dispos'd mens Minds to believe in him, who was come after him, and whose Fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he was, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He here again warns his <hi>Apostles</hi> to take heed of the Leaven of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees,</hi> and of <hi>Herod,</hi> Matth. 16.5, &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.14, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He comes to <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> where he cures one that was <hi>Blind,</hi> who recovers by degrees his sight, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.22. and passes from thence to the Towns of <hi>Caesarea</hi> and <hi>Phillippi,</hi> and by the way asks his <hi>Disciples,</hi> what Men thought of him, and what their Opinion was also of him; and for the good Confession which S. <hi>Peter</hi> made in the Name of all the rest, he receives from him in their Name exquisit Promises, foretels them his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and calls St <hi>Peter Satan,</hi> because he would disswade him from his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.13, &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.27, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.18, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Eight days after, according to St <hi>Luke</hi> he is <hi>Transfigur'd</hi> on the <hi>Mount,</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of three of his most intimate <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> talks there with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and coming down thence explains to them how <hi>Elias</hi> was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come, <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.1, &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.1, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.28, &amp;c. The next morning returning to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> he finds them environ'd by a great <hi>Multitude,</hi> and he at his coming cast out a <hi>Devil</hi> from a Youth that was a <hi>Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> whom his <hi>Disciples</hi> could not dispossess, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.14, &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.14, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.37, &amp;c..</p>
                     <p>Being arrived at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> he pays the Tribute for himself, and S. <hi>Peter, Matt.</hi> 17.24. And knowing that his <hi>Disciples</hi> had contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way touching <hi>Superiority,</hi> he instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them largely on this Subject, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.1, &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.35, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.46, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Then the Feast of <hi>Tabernacles</hi> drawing nigh, he refuses his Company to his unbelieving Relations, in their journey to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> on the account of this Solemnity; but he goes up after them, sending before them two of his <hi>Disciples;</hi> yet the <hi>Samaritans</hi> would not receive him. In this <hi>Journey</hi> he sends 70 of his <hi>Disciples</hi> round about. Being arrived at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the midst of the <hi>Feast,</hi> he teaches in the <hi>Temple;</hi> the Officers who are sent to take him, return without him, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily astonished at his Doctrine, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.51, &amp;c. and 10.1, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 7.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="404" facs="tcp:63323:337"/>Withdrawing at Night to the <hi>Mount of Olives,</hi> he returns the next morning early into the <hi>Temple,</hi> where an <hi>Adulteress</hi> is brought to him, and having sent her away with a Charge to <hi>Sin</hi> no more, he shews at large who he is; and the <hi>Jews</hi> taking up <hi>Stones</hi> to stone him, he retires for his securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>John</hi> 8.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In passing by he sees and heals one born <hi>Blind</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> using <hi>Clay</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with <hi>spittle</hi> for this purpose, which he having published, the <hi>Jews</hi> are offended at it; which occasions a large sequel of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Instructions, <hi>John</hi> 9.1, &amp;. and 10.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The 70 <hi>Disciples</hi> return to him with Joy; he instructs a <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> who is our Neighbour; and enters into the House of <hi>Martha,</hi> who is much busied, whilst her Sister <hi>Mary</hi> attentively hears the Word, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17, &amp;c. Afterwards he teaches his <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> to <hi>pray;</hi> cures a <hi>Mute</hi> that was possest; a <hi>Woman</hi> cries out from the midst of the <hi>Crowd,</hi> That the <hi>Womb</hi> was blest that bore him, and he answers as heretofore, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Pharisee</hi> invites him to Dinner, where he censures the Pride and Covetousness of that sort of People, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.37, &amp;c. He again warns his <hi>Disciples</hi> to take care of the Leaven of <hi>Hypocrisy,</hi> refuses to divide the Succession between two contending Brethren, and gives on this occasion several excellent instructions, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>On what is reported to him touching the <hi>Galileans,</hi> who apparently were of the Sect of <hi>Judas Gaulonite,</hi> whose Blood <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Hand mingled with their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts every one to Repentance; <hi>heals</hi> in the <hi>Synagogue</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> a Woman, <hi>distempered</hi> 18 years; answers the question, Whether there would be many saved, and shews he little matters the Threatnings of <hi>Herod,</hi> Luke 13.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In his way towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Luke 13.22. he goes into a <hi>Pharisees</hi> House, to refresh himself, cures one troubled with a <hi>Dropsie</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> and as well at <hi>Table,</hi> as elsewhere, he sows the Seed of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, <hi>Luke</hi> Chapters 13, 14, 15, 16. His Disciples ask of him an encrease of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and are advised by him always, to esteem themselves unprofitable Servants. He cleanses ten <hi>Lepers</hi> in passing through <hi>Samaria,</hi> exhorts to pray always, and offers a <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Pharisee</hi> and <hi>Publican,</hi> Luke 17.1, &amp;c. and 18.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Being come to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in the <hi>Feast</hi> of the <hi>Dedications,</hi> he declares himself to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> and of one and the same Essence with the <hi>Father,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Jews</hi> would have laid hands on him; but he avoids them, <hi>John</hi> 10.22, &amp;c. This makes him leave <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to go beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> where St <hi>John</hi> had first <hi>Baptized;</hi> where several came to him; and the <hi>Pharisees</hi> Interrogate him touching <hi>Divorces,</hi> John 10.40, &amp;c. Matt. 19.1, &amp;c. Mark 10.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Little <hi>Children</hi> are brought to him, which he would not have hindred; and the young <hi>Man,</hi> who asks him what he should do to inherit <hi>Eternal life,</hi> and gloryed in his exact observation of the Law, goes away sad, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.13, &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Coming to <hi>Jericho,</hi> he restores sight to one that was blind, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.35. in the Town <hi>Zacheus</hi> a <hi>Publican</hi> receives him into his <hi>House,</hi> Luke 19 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Going out thence followed by a great Multitude, he gives sight to 2 that were <hi>Blind,</hi> one of which was <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timaeus,</hi> Matt. 20.29, &amp;c.

In fine, 6 days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Passover</hi> he comes to <hi>Bethany,</hi> John 12.1. and at the <hi>Feast</hi> which is made there for him, he is Anointed by <hi>Mary</hi> with a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Oyntment</hi> (tho to <hi>Judas</hi> great trouble)

In the same day he shewed himself to 2 of his <hi>Disciples,</hi> one of which was called <hi>Cleophas,</hi> and the other (as 'tis thought) was <hi>Luke,</hi> who went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> where they knew him in the Breaking of <hi>Bread,</hi> Mark 16.12, 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.13.

he procured them a great Draught of <hi>Fishes</hi> for which they had fruitlesly toyl'd all Night.

Coming all to Land they see there <hi>Fish</hi> a dressing, whereto he bid them to joyn some of their <hi>Fish,</hi> and makes them dine with him. After <hi>Dinner</hi> he draws from <hi>Peter</hi> a threefold profession of his Love, to oppose it to his triple Denial of him, and re-establishes him 3 times in the <hi>Office</hi> from which he seem'd to have fallen; obscurely foretold him, that he shoud be <hi>Crucified</hi> in his old Age, and would not have him concern himself with what would become of <hi>John,</hi> and this was the 3d time he shewed himself to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> John 21.</p>
                     <p>Since the XI had betaken themselves to the <hi>Mountain,</hi> which he had appointed them; they saw him, worshipt him, and there received a more particular Explication of their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> in the Name of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> Matt. 28.16, &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> also speaks of divers Appearances of the <hi>LORD,</hi> after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and amongst others, that he had particularly appeared to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the lesser, and twice to the whole Assembly of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and another time to 500 <hi>Brethren</hi> together, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5, 6, 7. which seems to have been in the <hi>Mountain,</hi> which the <hi>LORD</hi> indicated.</p>
                     <p>For 40 Days together, he at several times Communed familiarly with them, with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable Proofs of the truth of his <hi>Resurrection, Acts</hi> 1.3, 10, 41, that they might be <hi>Witnesses</hi> of it to all People over all the <hi>World.</hi> It appears from Antiquity, that <hi>Pilate</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Emperor <hi>Tiberius</hi> of this, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the <hi>Senate,</hi> the putting our <hi>Saviours</hi> Image amongst the number of the <hi>Gods;</hi> and tho Divine Providence hindered the <hi>Senate</hi> from doing it, yet the <hi>Emperour</hi> expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the <hi>Christians</hi> to be Persecuted. At the end of these 40 Days having Assembled them at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he ordered them not to remove thence till they had received the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> and finding them still possest with an opinion of his <hi>Earthly Reign</hi> he turned their thoughts from it, forbidding them to enquire of the Time and Seasons which <hi>GOD</hi> had kept in his own power, and goeth out with them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Bethany,</hi> to the <hi>Mount of Olives,</hi> where having blest them, he was lifted up from them into <hi>Heaven,</hi> being supported by a <hi>Cloud,</hi> and thus received into his Glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49, <hi>&amp;c.

                     <p>10 Days after our LORD's <hi>Ascension,</hi> in the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> was sensibly given to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> by the gift of <hi>Languages;</hi> and the same day, at the first <hi>Preaching</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> 3000 Men were converted to the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Baptized</hi> in his Name, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1, &amp;c. And these were the beginings of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which (by the agreement of its <hi>Members,</hi> their Charity, Union and Assiduity in exercises of <hi>Piety</hi>) every day increased, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Some time after, one <hi>Lame</hi> from his Birth, about 40 years of Age, was miraculously cured by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>John;</hi> the relation of which is treated of in the 214th Discourse.</p>
                     <p>The Union of the <hi>Church</hi> is powerfully maintain'd, and all things are had in Common, if not in possession, yet in use amongst her <hi>Members,</hi> there being no Indigent Person amongst them: Such as had <hi>Houses</hi> or <hi>Lands,</hi> sold them, and brought the Price and laid it at the <hi>Apostles</hi> Feet, to be distributed to every one according to his Necessity, as was done particularly by <hi>Barnabas</hi> the <hi>Levite,</hi> but born in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> whose <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> was signal afterwards in the propagation of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> But <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his Wife, having dealt hypocritically in a like occasion, by bringing but half of the Price which they had received for the <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and yet affirming they had sold it for no more, were both punish'd by sudden Death at S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s word, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32, &amp;c. And as the <hi>Apostles</hi> daily persevered in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Porch,</hi> and signaliz'd themselves by divers <hi>Miracles,</hi> to such a degree, that the <hi>Sick</hi> (over which past the <hi>Shadow</hi> of S. <hi>Peter</hi>) were healed, and that from all the <hi>Country</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts <hi>People</hi> came flocking to them, the <hi>High Priest,</hi> chief of the <hi>Sadducean</hi> Party, and those of his Faction, made the <hi>Apostles</hi> be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and confined in the publick <hi>Prison,</hi> whom an <hi>Angel</hi> delivers thence in the Night, and the <hi>Council</hi> sending thither in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, they found the <hi>Prison Doors</hi> fast, and the <hi>Watch</hi> set, but the <hi>Prisoners</hi> gone, who were at the <hi>Temple</hi> doing their Office; where the <hi>Captain</hi> goes to fetch them, but without violence.

                     <p>Thus past the 34th Year of our <hi>LORD,</hi> which concurr'd with the 19th of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> We may refer to the 35th, the <hi>Contention</hi> which hapned between the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were yet equally <hi>Jews,</hi> differing only by <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Language,</hi> which had for a long time produc'd the Seed of an old <hi>Emulation.</hi> For the preventing of this Disorder 7 <hi>Deacons</hi> were established, who should take care of the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Widows</hi> of both sides. These were <hi>Stephen, Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menas,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas,</hi> the last of which was a Proselite. And it appears from their <hi>Greek</hi> Names, that in this Choice there was more regard had to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> than the <hi>Hebrews, Acts</hi> 6.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis likely this 35th Year was past very peaceably by the <hi>Church,</hi> which greatly multiplied at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> even to that degree, that several <hi>Priests</hi> became obedient to the <hi>Faith.</hi> In the mean time S. <hi>Stephen</hi> grew famous for his <hi>Piety,</hi> his <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> and was every day disputing with the <hi>Hellenists</hi> or <hi>Greeks,</hi> for the truth of the <hi>Gospel;</hi> but in fine, these unhappy People <hi>Libertins, Cyrenians, Alexandrians, Cilicians,</hi> and <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> being not able to resist his Wisdom, they suborn'd <hi>false Witnesses</hi> against him, who accuse him of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> against <hi>Moses,</hi> against the <hi>Temple,</hi> and against <hi>GOD.</hi> Appearing on this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation before the <hi>Council,</hi> he defends himself by a long and earnest <hi>Apology;</hi> at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of which, he is drawn by these mad Zealots out of the Town, and cruelly <hi>Stoned; Saul</hi> keeping the <hi>Cloaths</hi> of the <hi>false Witnesses,</hi> who were to cast the first <hi>Stones</hi> at him, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 7.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Persecution</hi> began by the Death of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> in the Year 36; it grew so violent by the Fury of <hi>Saul,</hi> and others, that it caus'd a great dispersion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> of which the Chief Members, (excepting the <hi>Apostles</hi>) search'd their Retreat, some in the other Towns of <hi>Judea,</hi> others in those of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> which yet turned to the propagation of the Gospel, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 11.19.

                     <p>In like manner also some of this Dispersion went to <hi>Damascus,</hi> as <hi>Ananias,</hi> Acts 9.19.25. and 22.12; others into <hi>Phenicia, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> and announced the <hi>Gospel</hi> every where to those of that <hi>Nation;</hi> and some <hi>Cypriots</hi> and <hi>Syrenians,</hi> spake of it with success also to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts 11.19.

                     <p>A while after these things past in the East, <hi>Tiberius</hi> dies in the 23d year of his <hi>Empire,</hi> and <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> succeeds him; so that the 23d of him and the 1st of this, concur with the 37th of our <hi>LORD.

                        <hi>Paul</hi> being Converted to <hi>Christ</hi> about the year 38, and 2 years before the Death of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> (in which time <hi>Josephus</hi> the <hi>Jewish Historian</hi> was born) had began to <hi>Preach the Gospel</hi> at <hi>Damascus,</hi> with as much Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on one hand, as Efficacy on the other; and after a Voyage into <hi>Arabia,</hi> for the same purpose, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.17. being returned, the <hi>Jews</hi> who were Enemies of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> favoured by the Governor, had done him mischief, had not the <hi>Faithful</hi> let him down by Night from the <hi>Wall</hi> in a <hi>Basket,</hi> Acts 9.20, &amp;c. 2 Cor. 11.32, 33. Being thus got out of <hi>Damascus,</hi> 3 years after his <hi>Conversion,</hi> he comes to <hi>Jerusalom,</hi> and by the Mediation of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> he visits there only S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the Brother of our <hi>Lord,</hi> commonly termed the <hi>Lesser,</hi> and tarried only 15 Days, which did not pass without Disputation with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and danger of his Life. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the <hi>Temple</hi> (as he Prayed) an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Command to go and <hi>Preach the Gospel</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and therefore the Brethren conducted him to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and from thence sent him to <hi>Tarsus,</hi> which was his Country, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 22.17, <hi>&amp;c. Gal.</hi> 17.18, 19.</p>
                     <p>After this <hi>Conversion,</hi> and by the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hapning in the <hi>Empire,</hi> and in <hi>Judea,</hi> the <hi>Persecution</hi> stopt there, and the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Judea, Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> flourished and were calm. And it was perhaps <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi>'s first year, when <hi>Peter</hi> Visiting the <hi>Churches,</hi> cured at <hi>Lydia</hi> the Paralitick <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and raised up <hi>Tabbitha</hi> at <hi>Joppa,</hi> where he remained a long time at <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Tanners,</hi> Acts 9.31.</p>
                     <p>Then also <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Centurion,</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Man, and one that feared <hi>GOD,</hi> tho' a <hi>Gentile,</hi> was advertized by an <hi>Angel</hi> to send for <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Joppa,</hi> to be instructed by him. The <hi>Apostle</hi> being prepared for this <hi>Journy</hi> by a <hi>Vision,</hi> which tended not to make him stand on distinctions of <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> he went without difficulty, attended with some of the <hi>Brethren;</hi> and was received by <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> with too great Respect, which he refuses: At the hearing of the <hi>Gospel</hi> Preached, he and those that are with him receive the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and are <hi>Baptiz'd</hi> in the Name of the <hi>LORD,</hi> Acts 10.1, &amp;c. <hi>Peter</hi> being return'd to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is obliged to give an account of this Action, which some reprehended; but they were all satisfied at the Report he made them, and praised <hi>GOD,</hi> Acts 11.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Whilst these things past in <hi>Palistine,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> Preaches in <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Damascus, Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi> Deifies himself, and makes himself the <hi>Priest</hi> to his own <hi>Godhead,</hi> associating his <hi>Horse</hi> in his godly <hi>Religion;</hi> He uses the <hi>Alexandrian Jews</hi> very roughly, for not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him a <hi>God,</hi> and resolves by force to make his <hi>Image</hi> be set up in the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to be there served and worshiped; which yet he could not obtain. <hi>Barnabas</hi> was sent by the <hi>Apostles</hi> to <hi>Antioch,</hi> to take cognizance of the condition of the <hi>Church</hi> there, to the Edification of which he gave great Assistance, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At the same time the Prophet <hi>Agabus,</hi> being come down from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Antioch,</hi> foretold the future <hi>Famine,</hi> which hapned since under the Empire of <hi>Claudius</hi> in the 4th year, and this <hi>Prediction</hi> obliged the <hi>Churches</hi> to make <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections</hi> for the <hi>Brethren</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> which were in a fit time sent by <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> Acts 11.27.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Barnabas</hi> seeing at <hi>Antioch</hi> the Harvest great, goes to search for <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Tarsus,</hi> and brings him, where they Sojourned a year, to the great Edification of the <hi>Church</hi> in this place: And in this time it was when the <hi>Disciples</hi> were first called <hi>Christians,</hi> Acts 11.25, 26. In fine, <hi>Caligula</hi> was killed, more

worthy of the Name of <hi>Monster,</hi> than that of <hi>Man;</hi> and <hi>Claudius</hi> his Unkle, the Son of <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> succeeds him with Fear; but <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi> encouraging him, obtained by this means his Favor as he had possest that of his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, so that he confirm'd to him, and even much encreast his Power and Authority. Thus the 4th of <hi>Caligula,</hi> and the 1st of <hi>Claudius</hi> concur with the 41st of our Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herod</hi> being returned into <hi>Judea</hi> with this increase of Power and Honour, in the 2d year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and 42d of <hi>Christ,</hi> he did many Acts of <hi>Jewish Devotion,</hi> and caused a <hi>Chain</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> which he had received from <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi> (instead of an <hi>Iron</hi> one, wherewith <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> had fastned him) to be hung up in the <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> But he began to persecute the <hi>Church,</hi> and put to death <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Major,</hi> the Son of <hi>Zebedee;</hi> and seeing that this pleased the <hi>Jews,</hi> he imprisoned also <hi>Peter,</hi> with design to bring him forth to the <hi>Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> after the Feast of the <hi>Passover;</hi> but when he was to be drawn forth to <hi>Punishment,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> miraculously delivered him from <hi>Prison,</hi> making the <hi>Gates</hi> open of themselves before him. The particulars of which is taken notice of in the 220 discourse, <hi>viz</hi> St Peter<hi>'s delivery out of Prison.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's held that St <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote his <hi>Gospel</hi> about this time, as under the particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> so by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Advice of the other <hi>Apostles,</hi> for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of those of the <hi>Circumcision,</hi> who had believ'd. And tho several have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that he wrote it in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but that by himself or some other it was since Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into <hi>Greek,</hi> such as we have it, yet may we with greater likelihood of Truth say, that he himself wrote it in <hi>Greek,</hi> because the number of the <hi>Hellenist Jews</hi> converted to the <hi>Faith,</hi> was at first greater than that of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> witness the first 7 <hi>Deacons</hi> being taken thence. At the same time <hi>Herod</hi> who had taken away the <hi>High Priesthood</hi> from <hi>Theophilus,</hi> to confer it on <hi>Simon Canthara,</hi> takes it also from him to give it to <hi>Jonathas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Annas,</hi> who refuses it through <hi>Modesty,</hi> and recommends to the <hi>King</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Matthias,</hi> who had it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herod</hi> after this, and in the year 43 goeth to reside at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and designing to make War on the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Sidonians,</hi> they found means to appease him by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Blaflus,</hi> his <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> because they drew all their Provision from the <hi>Kings Country,</hi> and then hapned the <hi>Famine</hi> foretold by <hi>Agabus.</hi> On occasion of which Treaty of <hi>Peace,</hi> giving several Spectacles to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he also would needs harangue them from the <hi>Tribunal,</hi> where he sat Mrgnificently <hi>Cloathed,</hi> and his <hi>Flatterers</hi> to applaud him, extolling the Majesty and Eloquence of his Discourse, cried out, <hi>'Twas the Voice of GOD, and not of Man;</hi> An <hi>Angel</hi> therefore struck him, for not giving Glory to <hi>GOD,</hi> nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending these impious Acclamations, and he died gnawed with <hi>Worms,</hi> Acts 12.19, &amp;c. <hi>Josephus</hi> also recites the Death of this Prince conformably to what St <hi>Luke</hi> says of it, but he relates more circumstances, Lib. 19 <hi>Antiq.</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the last Chapter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> had timely brought some small time before <hi>Herod</hi> began to rage against the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the Collection made in the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> for the Poor of <hi>Judea,</hi> to succour them in the approaching <hi>Famine</hi> foretold by <hi>Agabus,</hi> and which seemed now to be at the Door. From <hi>Jerusalem</hi> they returned to <hi>Antioch,</hi> bringing with them S. <hi>John,</hi> surnamed <hi>Mark,</hi> who is thought to be the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> bearing this name, and who perhaps was as well as St <hi>Luke</hi> of the number of the LXX, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.29, 30, <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.25.</p>
                     <p>As they attended their Ministry with their Fellow-Labourers in the Church, <hi>Simeon,</hi> who was call'd <hi>Niger, Lucius</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian,</hi> who is thought to have been St <hi>Luke</hi> the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list,</hi> and <hi>Manahem,</hi> who had been brought up with <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch,</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> designed them for an Employ of greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for which they set out accompanied with <hi>John,</hi> and attended by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the rest, about the 4th year of the Empire of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and the 44th of our <hi>Lord,</hi> and come to <hi>Seleucia,</hi> whence embarking they come down to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the Country of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and begin to Preach the <hi>Gospel</hi> at <hi>Salanus,</hi> Acts 13.1, 2, 3. In traversing the <hi>Isle</hi> they arrive at <hi>Paphos,</hi> where <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> the <hi>Pro-Consul</hi> had his residence, who desired to hear them; but a <hi>False Prophet,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> named <hi>Barjesu,</hi> and surnamed <hi>Elymas,</hi> that is, <hi>Magician</hi> or <hi>Enchanter,</hi> endeavour'd to hinder him. <hi>Paul</hi> who now leaves the name of <hi>Saul,</hi> whether in remembrance of the <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Pro-Consul,</hi> or for the sound sake of his Name, by the change of the first Letter to the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Pronunciation, vigorously opposes this <hi>Impostor,</hi> and denounces to him a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Blindness,</hi> wherewith he was immediately

struck, which occasioned the <hi>Pro-Consul</hi>'s Conversion, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Departing from <hi>Cyprus</hi> they come to <hi>Perga</hi> of <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> where <hi>John,</hi> surnamed <hi>Mark,</hi> leaves them to return to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Acts 13.13. From <hi>Perga</hi> they came to <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Pisidia,</hi> where being entered into the <hi>Synagogue</hi> on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day,</hi> they are desired after the Reading of the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> to <hi>preach to</hi> the <hi>People;</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> did by a long and grave discourse. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> at their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, entreat them to Preach the same things the next <hi>Sabbath-day;</hi> in which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the whole <hi>Town</hi> assembled to hear the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>GOD.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them; but they declare that on their refusal, by which they made themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> they would hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward address themselves to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who receiv'd this News with great Joy, <hi>and as many of them as believed were ordained to Eternal Life.</hi> Yet the <hi>Jews</hi> having gain'd some of their bigotted <hi>Proselytes,</hi> they stirr'd up a <hi>Persecution</hi> against these two <hi>faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Jesus Christ,</hi> who having shak'd the <hi>Dust</hi> of their <hi>Feet</hi> against their Persecutors, and left their <hi>Disciples</hi> much comforted, they past to <hi>Iconium,</hi> a City of <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> Acts 13.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Being enter'd there in the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> they spake with such efficacy, that several, as well <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Greeks,</hi> believed in the <hi>Lord.</hi> They made a considerable stay here, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd themselves by several <hi>Miracles.</hi> On this occasion two Parties are formed in the Town, one for them, and another for the <hi>Jews:</hi> But on the Point, when those latter, (strengthened by the most powerful) design'd to mischief them, they fled to <hi>Lystra</hi> and <hi>Derbe,</hi> and the Quarters thereabouts, where they Preach the <hi>Gospel,</hi> Acts 14.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's thought then was brought over to <hi>Christ</hi> S. <hi>Thecla,</hi> an <hi>Ironean Virgin,</hi> very famous at that time in the <hi>Church,</hi> tho the <hi>Acts</hi> which bore her Name are held for <hi>Apocryphal.</hi> At <hi>Lystra,</hi> a man Lame from his Birth, having been miraculously cured by them, the people of the place take them for <hi>Gods,</hi> calling <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Paul, Mercury,</hi> because he spake most, and would needs sacrifice to them, which they refuse with the greatest aversion, beseeching them to turn from these vain <hi>Idols</hi> to the living <hi>GOD.</hi> But certain obstinate <hi>Jews,</hi> which came from <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Iconia</hi> to oppose them, stirr'd up the <hi>Populacy</hi> against them, who begin now to fling <hi>Stones</hi> at them; and drew <hi>Paul</hi> out of the Town as dead, yet being environ'd by the <hi>Disciples</hi> he comes to himself, rises up and enters again into the Town, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Those who refer the date of the 2d of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to the 4th of <hi>Nero,</hi> pretend that in this year, and perhaps in this place, hapned the Ravishment of <hi>Paul</hi> up into the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> which was 14 years before, as he declares it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Lystra</hi> they come to <hi>Derbe,</hi> where having instructed several, they returned back to <hi>Lystra, Iconia,</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Pisidia,</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing in all the <hi>Churches Governours</hi> and <hi>Pastors.</hi> Passing thro <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> they Preach at <hi>Perga,</hi> descend to <hi>Attalia,</hi> and thence Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark for <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they relate what <hi>GOD</hi> had done by them in the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and tarry there a good while, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilst they were here <hi>Anno</hi> 49. some of the <hi>Circumcision,</hi> who yet in some sort had received the <hi>Gospel,</hi> came from <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> St <hi>Paul</hi> calls them <hi>false Brethren,</hi> who thrust themselves into the <hi>Church</hi> to invade the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.4. They had been of the Sect of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and 'tis thought they were of the Party of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> famous <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and who may be said to be the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of the <hi>Photinians, Chiliasts, Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Semi-Jews.</hi> Some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients affirm, That <hi>Cerinthus</hi> himself was of this party; these would needs oblige the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be <hi>Circumcised,</hi> and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all the Ordinances of the <hi>Law;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> vigorously opposed themselves; and because they strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves under the pretended Authority of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the Mother Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Brethren of <hi>Antioch</hi> depute <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> having also <hi>Titus</hi> with them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.1. at whose Arrival the <hi>Synod</hi> was convocated, the Question debated, and decided in favour of the <hi>Christian Liberty;</hi> those who had begun and maintained this Doctrine at <hi>Antioch,</hi> disown'd; and the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Gentiles</hi> only obliged to abstain from <hi>Blood</hi> and things <hi>Strangled,</hi> and those pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Uncleanness.

otherwise <hi>Barsabas,</hi> and of <hi>Silas,</hi> who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the 2 others in their return to <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they were well received; and <hi>Judas</hi> honourably dismist, to return into <hi>Judea; Silas</hi> staid at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts 15.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This hapned according to the common Opinion, 17 years after the <hi>Conversion</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> as they gather from <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18. and 2.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we had rather, that we may not too much differ from the Calcuation of others, understand 14 years of the 2d Chapter since his <hi>Conversion,</hi> and not since the first Journy he made to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> after that of <hi>Damascus</hi> and <hi>Arabia;</hi> in which Case we must assign the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to the 50th year of our <hi>Lord,</hi> which was the 10th of <hi>Claudius</hi> and the 8th after the Collection of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> carried by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> into <hi>Judea.</hi> And tho' after their first going into <hi>Cyprus</hi> and other places, to which there can no less time be allow'd than 2 years, they were return'd to <hi>Antioch;</hi> there's great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood <hi>Paul</hi> did not sojourn there so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, but that he now and then visited other places, which were not far distant, to advance the <hi>Gospel;</hi> to which we may refer what he recites of the propagation of the <hi>Gospel</hi> by his Ministry as far as <hi>Illyrium,</hi> Rom. 15.19, 20. and one part of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, Accidents,</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> to which he had to that time been exposed, and which he summarily recites, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, &amp;c.</p>

It seems that then he wrote his 1st <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom in parting he had left at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to Govern the Church there, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.3. But <hi>Timothy</hi> comes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after to him in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where he had not determined any thing about his abode there. <hi>Titus</hi> also being come near to him in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and brought him good News from <hi>Corinth,</hi> he writes from <hi>Philippi</hi> his 2d Epistle in his Name and that of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and char<hi>Titus</hi> and another with it, who is thought to have been St <hi>Luke</hi> the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> with order to take care the Collections which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended above a year ago, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2. might be ready for him at his arrival, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 8.16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 9.3, 4, 5.</p>

                        <hi>Anno</hi> 59. After some stay in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he comes into <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains 3 <hi>Months,</hi> and whence he writes (by the Hand of <hi>Tertius</hi>) his <hi>Epistles</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and sends it by <hi>Phaebe,</hi> a <hi>Deaconess</hi> of the Church of <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> on the point of carrying to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> the Collections made for the <hi>Saints,</hi> Rom. 15.25, 26. and 16.1, 2, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.2, 23. Then also <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> from <hi>Nicapolis,</hi> in which he obliges him to come to him, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.12. The <hi>Apostle</hi> had left him in <hi>Crete,</hi> to settle Pastors in every <hi>Town;</hi> after that, going from <hi>Macedonia</hi> into <hi>Greece</hi> by the <hi>Aegean Sea,</hi> he had Landed in <hi>Crete</hi> or <hi>Candia,</hi> and there laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Christianity.</hi> There, to avoid the Ambushes of the <hi>Jews,</hi> had he taken the way of <hi>Syria;</hi> he determines to take that of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> and sends <hi>Sopater,</hi> (who is called <hi>Sosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater,</hi> Rom. 6.21.) the <hi>Beraean, Aristarchus,</hi> and <hi>Secundus (Thessalonians) Gaius, Timotheus, Tychicus,</hi> and <hi>Trophimus,</hi> to stay for him at <hi>Troas;</hi> and weighing Anchor at <hi>Philippi</hi> (with the rest of his Company) after the Feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> he comes to them 5 days after, and there remained 7. On <hi>Sunday</hi> all the <hi>Faithful</hi> being Assembled to celebrate the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> Preaching till Midnight, a young man named <hi>Eutychus,</hi> sitting in a <hi>Window</hi> and o're-taken with Sleep, falls dead from the 3d Story; but the <hi>Apostle</hi> having embraced him raises him up alive. From <hi>Troas</hi> he Journied to <hi>Assos</hi> by Land, and the rest of his Company by Water; where having met, they come to <hi>Metelin;</hi> where parting they found themselves the next morning in sight of <hi>Chios,</hi> and the day following touching at <hi>Samos,</hi> they stopt at <hi>Trogyllum,</hi> and arrived the next day at <hi>Miletum,</hi> which was not far from <hi>Ephesus. Paul</hi> hastning to be at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> sends for the Bishops and Pastors of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to come to <hi>Miletum,</hi> to
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:63323:343"/>
whom he represents the integrity of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and his preparedness for the Afflictions which attended him, and seriously exhorts them to acquit themselves well of their Duty; and his Discourse being ended, he is conducted by all of them to the <hi>Ship,</hi> Acts 20.3, &amp;c. not without Disconsolating them, by telling them, <hi>They would no more see his Face,</hi> as he then thought; tho <hi>GOD</hi> gave him an opportunity of Visiting them again, after his first Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Parting from <hi>Miletum,</hi> they steer dirictly to <hi>Coos,</hi> the next day to <hi>Rhodes</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Patara;</hi> where they Embark on a Vessel which was bound for <hi>Phoenicia.</hi> Thus leaving <hi>Cyprus</hi> on the left, and making towards <hi>Syria</hi> they arrive at <hi>Tyre,</hi> where they tarried 7 days, and found there <hi>Disciples,</hi> who would have dissuaded <hi>Paul</hi> from going to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing by the <hi>Spirit</hi> the <hi>Persecutions</hi> which he was to undergo. At <hi>Tyre</hi> they Embark'd, for <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> where they tarried one day with the <hi>Brethren,</hi> Acts 21.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Ptolemais</hi> they come to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and Lodge at <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> who had been one of the 7 <hi>Deacons,</hi> and whose 4 <hi>Daughters</hi> were enlightned with the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy. Agabus</hi> foretold <hi>Paul</hi> of his Bonds, who could not be diverted from going to <hi>Jerusalem, Acts</hi> 21.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Having abode several days at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> they part thence for <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> carrying with them an ancient <hi>Disciple,</hi> a <hi>Cyprian</hi> named <hi>Mnason,</hi> at whose house <hi>Paul</hi> was to Lodge. They are kindly received by the <hi>Brethren</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The next day after their Arrival they Visit St <hi>James,</hi> and all the Elders of the <hi>Church</hi> are Assembled; to whom <hi>Paul</hi> represents the success of his <hi>Ministry</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and exhibits without doubt the <hi>Collections</hi> he brought for the poor of <hi>Judea.</hi> He is here advised to purify himself (according to the Law) with 4 other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Jews,</hi> who had made a Vow of a <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi> to refute the Calumny, as being a Deserter of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of bad Example to all the <hi>Jews,</hi> who also believed in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to forsake it. But this Project little availed, tho <hi>Paul</hi> made use of it; for some <hi>unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jews</hi> being come from <hi>Asia</hi> to the <hi>Feast,</hi> having seen him in the <hi>Temple,</hi> where he had satisfied this <hi>Purification,</hi> cry out against him, as a declared Enemy of the <hi>Nation,</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> and that <hi>Place.</hi> They also accuse him for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning the <hi>Temple,</hi> by carrying <hi>Greeks</hi> into it, (for they had seen <hi>Trophimus</hi> in the Streets with him, and imagined he had introduced him therein) and having raised a great Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, they endeavoured to kill him: But <hi>Claudius Lysias,</hi> the Collonel, who Commanded the <hi>Garrison,</hi> coming hereupon with his <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi> took him out of their hands, and causes him to be laid in <hi>Irons.</hi> And not being able to get any certain knowledge of the Matter, by reason of the <hi>Tumult,</hi> he orders him to be carried into the <hi>Castle</hi> called <hi>Antonia,</hi> where the <hi>Garrison</hi> lay, where the Crowd was so great, that the <hi>Soldiers</hi> were forced to carry him on their Shoulders up <hi>Sairs,</hi> where he desires leave to speak to the people. <hi>Lysias</hi> asks him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was not the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> who some years before having gather'd (under the Title of a <hi>Prophet</hi>) about 4000 men, had seized on the <hi>Mount of Olives;</hi> for <hi>Felix</hi> the Governour had indeed defeated him; but as to his own person, he had escap'd without any bodies knowing what was become of him. See <hi>Joseph</hi> l. 2. c. 20. But <hi>Paul</hi> having declared himself a <hi>Jew,</hi> and born at <hi>Tarsus;</hi> obtain'd permission to speak, and offers his Apology in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures him the greater <hi>silence,</hi> until he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned his being sent of <hi>GOD</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> Then all all his <hi>Hearers</hi> cry out impetuously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, as unworthy to live, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.17, &amp;c. and 22.1, &amp;c. <hi>Lysias</hi> hereupon makes him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the <hi>Castle,</hi> and orders him to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by <hi>Scourging;</hi> but the <hi>Apostle</hi> having represented to the <hi>Captain,</hi> That he was a <hi>Roman Citizen; Lysias</hi> respecting this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd Quality, which he himself had bought so dear, made him be speedily unbound, and the day following he convocates the whole <hi>Senate</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to hear the Heads of his Accusation, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.23, <hi>&amp;c. Annanias,</hi> who is thought to have been Depos'd, and to exercise the Office of <hi>Chief Priest</hi> only on this occasion, caused <hi>Paul</hi> to be struck without any Reason, which hindred not the <hi>Apostle</hi> from going on with his Defence, and by declaring himself a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> he set them all at variance with one another; which <hi>Lysias</hi> observing, took care of <hi>Paul,</hi> and carried him back into the <hi>Castle</hi> by the <hi>Soldiers, Acts</hi> 23.1, &amp;c. The <hi>LORD</hi> streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens this <hi>Apostle</hi> the Night following. The next morning more than 40 <hi>Zealots</hi> conspire to slay him; which Enterprize is discover'd by a young Lad, <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sisters Son; and <hi>Lysias</hi> to hinder it, sends him the Night following with a good Guard to <hi>Cesarea,</hi> where resided <hi>Felix</hi> the Governour of the Province, who confined him in <hi>Herod</hi>'s Palace, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.12, <hi>&amp;c. Anno</hi> 60, 61.</p>

                        <pb n="418" facs="tcp:63323:344"/>Five Days after <hi>Ananias</hi> came to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> to implead <hi>Paul,</hi> thereunto joyning Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints against <hi>Lysias,</hi> who had taken him out of their Hand. The <hi>Apostle</hi> returns a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Answer to every thing, and <hi>Felix</hi> refers to another opportunity the Judgment on this matter. <hi>Felix,</hi> some days after, makes <hi>Paul</hi> be brought before him, who strikes him with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by a pathetical discourse of <hi>Justice, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi> and the <hi>future Judgment.</hi> He hopes to draw Money; but finding himself disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and constrain'd 2 years after to leave his Place to another, to gratify the <hi>Jews,</hi> he left the <hi>Apostle</hi> a Prisoner, <hi>Acts</hi> Chap. 24.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 62. To <hi>Felix,</hi> whose Government was very Insolent and Tyrannical, succeeds <hi>Portias Festus,</hi> about the same time as <hi>Nero</hi> put his Mother <hi>Agrippina</hi> to death, who (to hasten the promotion of her Unnatural Son) had poyson'd the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> her Husband. 3 Days after <hi>Festus</hi> arrived at <hi>Caesarea</hi> he came to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where the <hi>High Priest</hi> and Chief of the <hi>Council</hi> renew'd their Accusation against the <hi>Apostle,</hi> and entreat <hi>Festus</hi> to send him to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> intending to have him Murther'd by the way; but <hi>Festus</hi> excuses himself, and declares, he would return to <hi>Caesarea</hi> in few days, and that then some of them should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be heard in his presence there. Having tarried not above 10 days at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he returns to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and the next Morning sits in the <hi>Judgment Seat;</hi> where having heard the Sum of what both Parties had to say; <hi>Festus</hi> (to gratify the <hi>Jews</hi>) demands of Paul, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would go up to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>to be Judged there before him</hi>? But the <hi>Apostle</hi> excuses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and appeals to <hi>Caesar,</hi> Acts 25.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Some days after, young <hi>Agrippa</hi> and his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Bernice</hi> came to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> to salute <hi>Festus,</hi> and congratulate his coming into those Parts. <hi>Festus</hi> speaks to them about his Prisoner, and what had hapned concerning him since he came to his <hi>Government;</hi> and knowing not what he would write to <hi>Caesar</hi> on <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, is very willing to have the Advice of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who having heard the <hi>Apostle</hi> reason very earnestly out of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> tho <hi>Festus</hi> made a Mock at all, acknowledges to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, <hi>That he had almost perswaded him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Christian;</hi> and declares to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>That he might have been released as Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, had he not appealed to</hi> Caesar, <hi>Acts</hi> 25.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 26.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In fine, <hi>Festus</hi> being resolved to send <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> with other Prisoners, under the Guard of an Officer named <hi>Julius,</hi> he was Embarkt on an <hi>Adramytten Ship,</hi> which went into <hi>Asia,</hi> accompanied by <hi>Timotheus,</hi> St <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starchus.</hi> Touching the next morning at <hi>Sidon, Julius</hi> permitted the <hi>Apostle</hi> to go to his <hi>Friends</hi> to be supplied by them with what he wanted. The Vessel arriving at <hi>Myra,</hi> a Town of <hi>Lycia,</hi> they found another there of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> bound for <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein <hi>Julius</hi> embarkt himself and his Prisoners. <hi>Paul</hi> would have advised them to have put in at <hi>Fair Havens,</hi> and there have <hi>Winter'd;</hi> because already the Fast of the Month of <hi>Tisri</hi> was past, that is, the Month of <hi>October</hi> was come, and the time of <hi>Navigation</hi> near spent: But the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Ship,</hi> to which <hi>Julius</hi> gave a greater adherence, than to that of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> prevailed. Not long after an horrible <hi>Tempest,</hi> and which continued for several days, meets with the Ship; yet the <hi>Apostle</hi> exhorts as well the <hi>Sea-men</hi> as <hi>Passengers,</hi> to take Courage, <hi>GOD</hi> having told him that Night, by an <hi>Angel, That he should stand before</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar, <hi>and that in consideration of him no Body should perish in the Ship.</hi> When the <hi>Vessel</hi> was ready to split, the <hi>Sea-men</hi> would have saved themselves in the <hi>Long Boat;</hi> but by the Counsel of <hi>Paul</hi> they are hindred. The <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> would have the Prisoners killed, but <hi>Julius</hi> (on <hi>Paul</hi>'s account) diverted them from that purpose; and the Vessel being wrecked, each man saves himself as he could, some by <hi>Swimming,</hi> and others on pieces of <hi>Planks;</hi> and thus all come safe to Land, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They found it was the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Malta,</hi> whose Inhabitants used them very Courteously. And a <hi>Viper</hi> fastning on <hi>Paul</hi>'s hand, as he gathered up <hi>Sticks</hi> to throw on the <hi>Fire,</hi> the <hi>Islanders</hi> believed he must presently die upon it, judging him to be a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> whom <hi>Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> pursued to Land; but seeing he had shak'd the Animal into the <hi>Fire</hi> without any hurt, they change both Thought and Language, and will have him now to be a God. Here <hi>Paul</hi> cured the Father of <hi>Publius,</hi> who was sick of a <hi>Fever,</hi> and pain in the <hi>Bowels;</hi> and also of those who were <hi>sick</hi> in the Island. Whence (after 3 Months) <hi>Julius</hi> Embarks his People in a Ship of <hi>Alexandria</hi> called <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux:</hi> The first place they cast Anchor was at <hi>Syracuse,</hi> where the Passengers refresh'd themselves for 3 days; at the end of which they set forth for <hi>Rhegium,</hi> and two days after to <hi>Puzziolum.</hi> And after that <hi>Julius</hi> had yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Requests of some of the <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                        <pb n="419" facs="tcp:63323:344"/>
who were there, that <hi>Paul</hi> should tarry 7 Days with them, they arriv'd at <hi>Rome, Acts</hi> 28.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilst these things hapned to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Mark</hi> is thought to have died at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the 8th year of <hi>Nero.</hi> Those who will have him to have wrote his <hi>Gospel</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> want Foundation: There is greater probability he wrote it whilst he accompanied the <hi>Apostle</hi> in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and that since it was sent or left by him at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> by reason of the great number of <hi>Jews</hi> which there remained, and amongst which he made a great progress. But according to this reckoning, either we must distinguish <hi>Mark</hi> the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> that is, <hi>John</hi> surnamed <hi>Mark,</hi> from another <hi>Mark</hi> the Cousin of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Coloss. 4.10. whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> (in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.) recommends to his <hi>Disciple</hi> to bring along with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> as being very useful to him in the <hi>Ministry;</hi> or if he be the same, it must be acknowledged, that those who make him die so soon, have not taken exact Measures. Moreover, whilst <hi>Festus</hi> was waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about what he should do with the <hi>Apostle, Nero</hi> having set <hi>Rome</hi> on Fire, laid the <hi>Crime</hi> on the poor <hi>Christians,</hi> whom he caused to be cloathed in the Skins of <hi>Wild Beasts,</hi> and thus exposed them to ravenous <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Bears,</hi> making it a sport of putting them to all cruel Tortures. And this was the first of the 10 <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,</hi> which the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> raised against the <hi>Christians.</hi> It was, as described by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> very sharp and fierce, but did not last long; for the <hi>Storm</hi> was in a manner over when <hi>Paul</hi> arrived at <hi>Rome.</hi> Then also <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Lesser,</hi> under the Authority of <hi>Ananias</hi> the High Priest and <hi>Sadducee,</hi> suffered <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> being thrown down from a <hi>Pinnacle</hi> and Ston'd. We have a <hi>Catholick Epistle</hi> of his amongst those of the <hi>New Testament;</hi> but it's not precisely known in what time he Wrote.</p>
                     <p>Now to return to <hi>Paul:</hi> The <hi>Brethren</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> understanding he was at <hi>Puzzoli,</hi> came out to meet him as far as the Market of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius;</hi> and <hi>Julius</hi> having delivered up the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Guards, Paul</hi> had leave to dwell apart by himself with a <hi>Souldier,</hi> who was his <hi>Keeper.</hi> 3 Days after he sends for the Chief Persons of the <hi>Nation,</hi> to whom he shews his Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his Innocency. They tell him, <hi>They had received no</hi> Information <hi>concerning him from</hi> Judea, <hi>and desire to hear from himself an account of his</hi> Sentiments, <hi>observing that the</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion <hi>was every where spoken against.</hi> He (on the Day appointed) declared to them the <hi>Kingdom of GOD,</hi> with different success, and a Protestation, That the <hi>Salvation</hi> which they refused, should be offered to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> remained 2 whole years in his own <hi>House,</hi> receiving all that would Hear him, and Preaching <hi>Christ</hi> at full liberty, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.15, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Here S. <hi>Luke</hi> ends his Relation, which he inscribes <hi>The Acts of the Apostles,</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently he wrote at <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was Prisoner there. He had written his <hi>Gospel</hi> long before, to oppose the Fabulous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of <hi>False Teachers,</hi> by which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to overthrow the <hi>Doctrine</hi> taught by our <hi>Saviours</hi> true <hi>Apostles.</hi> It's not known who was the <hi>Theophilus,</hi> to whom he Addresses both these Relations; but it seems, as to himself, he was to <hi>Paul</hi> what <hi>Mark</hi> was to <hi>Peter,</hi> for the <hi>Evangelical History;</hi> and he had been also with <hi>Coleophas</hi> (in the Way of <hi>Emaus</hi>) an Eye-witness of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Resurrection,</hi> Luke 24.13, &amp;c. It's of him and his <hi>Gospel</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18, 19. and whom he terms a <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> Coloss. 4.14. being far from the Profession of a <hi>Painter,</hi> attributed to him by the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> an Employment which in the Birth of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> was equally abominable and unlawful, both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians.</hi>

                     <p>Whilst <hi>Paul</hi> is a Prisoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> he writes to the <hi>Philippians</hi> by <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> whom they had sent to Visit him and assist him, and who employing himself with the <hi>Apostle</hi> in the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> was in danger of his Life by a great <hi>Sickness,</hi> in the very time when the <hi>Bonds</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> famous in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Palace, had brought over several of his <hi>Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> to the knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> Phil. 1.12, 13, and 2.19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 4.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he had Writ a while before from the same place to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> and to <hi>Philemon,</hi> by <hi>Onesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> a Fugitive Servant of his, who at <hi>Rome</hi> was Converted to the <hi>Faith</hi> by the <hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> who sent him back to his Master with a <hi>Letter,</hi> and entrusted him also (with <hi>Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>) with an <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> Coloss. 4.7, 8. I say, That the <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Philemon</hi> and the <hi>Colossians,</hi> preceded that of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> seeing that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was the Bearer of this, whereas he was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> and a <hi>Prisoner,</hi> if he be the same as <hi>Epaphras;</hi> and several think, when the 2 others were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>Coloss.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Philem.</hi> ver. 23. these 3 <hi>Epistles,</hi> to the <hi>Philippians, Colossians,</hi> and to <hi>Philemon,</hi> are written in the name of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> as a small time after the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
                        <pb n="420" facs="tcp:63323:345"/>
was written to the same place, in which he hoped to see them shortly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.23, 24. Not long after the City of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of which was concerned in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> was overthrown by an <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake;</hi> but is seems that since it arose in some sort from its fall, seeing the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is mentioned among the 7 <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> Rev. 1.11.</p>
                     <p>Now there's great likelyhood that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had been detain'd Prisoner at <hi>Rome</hi> 2 years, was releast about the 10th of <hi>Nero,</hi> which concurred with the 64th of our <hi>Lord;</hi> on the failure of his <hi>Accusers</hi> appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and under an Obligation to be in such a place as should be appointed at a time. Some pretend, that during this time, he accomplished the Design which he had of a long time of passing into <hi>Spain,</hi> Rom. 15.24, 28. At least may be gathered out of his <hi>Epistles</hi> written from <hi>Rome,</hi> that he had great hopes of returning again into <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Asia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> Philip. 1.25. &amp; 2.24. Yea, towards the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Heb. 13, 23.24. That he orders <hi>Philemon,</hi> when he writes to him in the name of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and his own, by <hi>Onesimus</hi> and <hi>Tychicus;</hi> to prepare him a Lodging, <hi>Philem.</hi> ver. 22. That <hi>Timothy,</hi> who had accompanied him his whole <hi>Voyage</hi> and <hi>Bonds</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and long dwelt with him, had been sent by him to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> during his first <hi>Imprisonment,</hi> and after the <hi>Epistles</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the <hi>Phillippians,</hi> to the <hi>Clossians,</hi> and to <hi>Philemon,</hi> which bear both his Name and that of <hi>Timothy.</hi> That <hi>Timothy</hi> was not then at <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> it being probable that parting from <hi>Rome,</hi> he was somewhere detained at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his <hi>Voyage</hi> to <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and that <hi>Paul</hi> (in receiving the News of his <hi>Relaxation,</hi> Heb. 13.23, 24.) expected he would have returned to him, tho being at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty he did not do it, but continued his way; And thus the <hi>Apostle</hi> being at length releas'd, tho the manner be unknown, parted also from <hi>Rome,</hi> and at least following <hi>Timothy; Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> took a turn into the <hi>East,</hi> according to his promise and hopes he had conceiv'd; seeing that in the 2d of <hi>Timothy</hi> writ from <hi>Rome,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of his days, and when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd himself for <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> he orders <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> to return speedily towards him, and to bring <hi>Mark</hi> with him; informing him, that <hi>Erastus,</hi> who probably had given some hope of accompanying him in this second <hi>Voyage</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet remained at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and was constrain'd to leave <hi>Trophimus</hi> sick at <hi>Miletum,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.11, 13, 20. which cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of a 2d Voyage of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that having had <hi>Timothy</hi> with him during the first, he must needs know, that <hi>Erastus</hi> was not of the Company, and <hi>Trophimus</hi> was stopt by Sickness at <hi>Miletum,</hi> and hindred to pass further. So when <hi>Paul</hi> (from his first Imprisonment) wrote to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> he says, that <hi>Mark</hi> was with him, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> ver. 24. But since he ordered <hi>Timothy</hi> to bring him to him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.11. when he wrote this 2d <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Demas</hi> was gone to <hi>Thessalonica, Crescens</hi> into <hi>Galatia,</hi> and not amongst the <hi>Gauls,</hi> as some have thought, <hi>Titus</hi> into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and he had only <hi>Luke</hi> with him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. But when he wrote to the <hi>Colossians</hi> and to <hi>Philemon,</hi> he had with him <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Demas, Coloss.</hi> 4.14. and <hi>Philem.</hi> ver 24. In this last <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he writes as being ready to suffer <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> and at the point of death, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. But in the other <hi>Epistle</hi> writ from <hi>Rome,</hi> he speaks, as hoping and assuring himself quickly to see those to whom they were directed: And as he salutes <hi>Timothy</hi> in the name of <hi>Eubulus, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Linus,</hi> and <hi>Claudia,</hi> of whom he had made no mention in his <hi>Epistles</hi> to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians, Colossians,</hi> and to <hi>Philemon;</hi> so he salutes the <hi>Colossians,</hi> and <hi>Philemon</hi> in the name of <hi>Aristarchus, Mark</hi> the Cousin of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and of <hi>Jesus</hi> surnam'd the <hi>Just,</hi> as of his Fellows in the Ministerial Labors at <hi>Rome,</hi> of whom he makes no mention to <hi>Timothy;</hi> but seeing he therein salutes <hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> and the Family of <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi> who was an <hi>Asiatick,</hi> there's great likelyhood, that the first who were at <hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> came there the first time, had also went out thence the 2d time with him, and return'd to dwell in <hi>Asia;</hi> or in <hi>Achaia.</hi> This diversity of Persons, joyned to the Circumstances already mentioned suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently verifies, that the <hi>Scene</hi> was changed, and that we must imagine a considerable Interval of Time between the <hi>Imprisonment</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the 2d, under which was writ the 2d <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We cannot say where <hi>Timothy</hi> Sojourn'd, when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to him his 2d <hi>Epistle,</hi> out of his 2d <hi>Bonds;</hi> and for what Reason he did not return to <hi>Rome</hi> with him, nor by whom it was sent to him, no more than we know how, whence, or on what occasion, the <hi>Apostle</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his <hi>Prison;</hi> but it's certain, that from
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:63323:345"/>
the same <hi>Prison,</hi> and a little before he had writ his 2d <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which is the last of all his <hi>Epistles,</hi> he wrote his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and sent it them by <hi>Tychicus,</hi> which manifestly appears from what we read <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.21. and 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.12. And certainly had the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> been carried by <hi>Tychicus,</hi> at the same time he carried with <hi>Onesimus</hi> the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> would as well have joyn'd the Name of <hi>Timothy</hi> with his, as well in that, as in this, were they sent away from <hi>Rome</hi> together at the same time. It's certain, that then <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers</hi> presented themselves against <hi>Paul,</hi> who altho' he was forsaken by all his Acquaintance in his first defence, yet was he so assisted by <hi>GOD,</hi> that he boldly defended <hi>Christianity,</hi> and was not at that time Condemn'd. But by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlocutory <hi>Sentence</hi> sent to <hi>Prison,</hi> in which he couragiously expected the time of his Death, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>
                     <p>Whilst <hi>Paul</hi> was either newly releas'd from his first <hi>Imprisonment,</hi> or return'd to his 2d, and therein detained, <hi>Peter</hi> wrote his 2d <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> sensible of his approaching Death, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. and after almost all of <hi>Paul</hi>'s were divulg'd amongst the <hi>Churches,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15, 16. and especially that which was writ to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that there's great Conformity in the Matters which are treated of in them both. A while after was writ the <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Jude</hi> whom the <hi>Evangelists</hi> call <hi>Lebbeus</hi> and <hi>Thad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> which is (as it were) an Epitomy of the 2d of <hi>Peter,</hi> and has great conformity with it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the opinion of some, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> suffer'd <hi>Martyrdom</hi> in the same place, and at the same time; It's certain they both suffer'd <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> and that <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> according as our <hi>Saviour</hi> had foretold him, <hi>John</hi> 21.18. And it's also certain, that <hi>Paul</hi> suffer'd <hi>Martyrdom</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he so joyfully expected it; but if <hi>Peter</hi> underwent it at the same time, and in the same place, (as some are of Opinion) he must have come to <hi>Rome</hi> a little before the Death of <hi>Paul,</hi> and after he had writ all his <hi>Epistles,</hi> seeing that in all of them he makes no mention of <hi>Peter,</hi> altho he takes notice of several others of less Consideration and Authority than he amongst the <hi>Christians.</hi> However, because it might happen that since the last <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> writ to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and consequently since his first Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It being our design to contain our selves within the compass of the <hi>Holy History,</hi> we shall say nothing of what may be mentioned touching the other <hi>Apostles</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> and the success of their <hi>Preaching</hi> in divers places of the <hi>World:</hi> and therefore to finish our Task, let's observe, That in the same time when <hi>Nero</hi> began to make <hi>Martyrs,</hi> whose <hi>Ashes</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> were the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Jewish Nation</hi> had filled up the measures of their <hi>Iniquities,</hi> and hastned by its Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, its entire and final ruin. The <hi>War</hi> had begun to grow hot since some years, between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans. Nero</hi> had sent <hi>Florus,</hi> (a wicked man) to succeed <hi>Albinus</hi> in the Government of <hi>Judea;</hi> who vexing, and in sundry manners oppressing the <hi>Jews,</hi> (prone enough of themselves to <hi>Sedition,</hi> and full of ill <hi>Humours</hi>), made them take the <hi>Bridle</hi> in their <hi>Teeth,</hi> and threw them into Despair. King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a great Zealot in <hi>Judaism,</hi> did what he could to disswade them from taking up <hi>Arms;</hi> but scarcely was he gone from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but certain seditious persons, who called themselves <hi>Zealots,</hi> surprized the <hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Massadas</hi> a strong place, and well provided, and therein kill all the <hi>Roman Garrison. Eleazer</hi> moreover the Son of the <hi>High Priest Ananias,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Temple,</hi> a factious and haughty person, perswades the <hi>Priests</hi> to offer no <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> but for the <hi>Jews,</hi> to the exclusion of those which were wont to be offered for the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Chief of the <hi>Town</hi> considering whereto this tended, entreat <hi>Florus</hi> at <hi>Cesarea,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> to send Forces speedily to stifle the <hi>Sedition</hi> in the Cradle. <hi>Florus,</hi> who desired no better, lets it increase; and the Troops which <hi>Agrippa</hi> sent, served only to form parties. They held with the chief persons the higher part of the <hi>Town,</hi> the Seditious possest the lowe <hi>Town</hi> and the <hi>Temple.</hi> 7 Days past between them in <hi>Skirmishes;</hi> but on occasion of a <hi>Feast,</hi> several <hi>Assassins</hi> or desperate <hi>People</hi> got into the <hi>Temple,</hi> and joyning with others, they burn <hi>Herods Palace</hi> and that of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and the House of <hi>Ananias. Manahem</hi> the Son of <hi>Judas,</hi> a <hi>Galilean,</hi> Chief of these <hi>Ruffians,</hi> and who had Armed them at <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sada,</hi> made himself Master of the <hi>Town,</hi>
                        <pb n="422" facs="tcp:63323:346"/>
having taken the Fort <hi>Antonia,</hi> and killed the <hi>Roman Garrison;</hi> but <hi>Eleazer</hi> Captain of the <hi>Temple,</hi> killed him in the very <hi>Temple,</hi> as he was there at <hi>Prayers;</hi> and having rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Party, he re-takes <hi>Massada,</hi> and kills in cold <hi>Blood,</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> the <hi>Roman Souldiers</hi> of several <hi>Garrisons,</hi> who had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered on Terms of Composition. <hi>Florus</hi> returns the same to the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Caesarea.</hi> And thus the <hi>Animosity</hi> sharpens on both sides, by the effusion of much <hi>Blood</hi> both in <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Syria. Cestius Gallus,</hi> Governor of <hi>Syria,</hi> Arms at this Report, takes and burns <hi>Joppa, Lyddia,</hi> and other <hi>Towns,</hi> marches towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Blocks up the <hi>Seditious,</hi> who had marched out in the <hi>Field</hi> against him, and might have then by the favour of the <hi>People</hi> possest himself of the <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> had he prest the <hi>Siege,</hi> which he suddenly raised, and without any Reason, with great loss of his Men, and several <hi>Machines</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> which he left behind him in his hasty Retreat, and which served since during the <hi>Siege</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to the defence of the <hi>Town.</hi> At the hearing of this, <hi>Nero,</hi> who was in <hi>Achaia,</hi> commits to <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian</hi> the Care of this <hi>War. Titus</hi> his Son brings him a great Reinforcement from <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and thus with an Army of 60000 Men, pierces into <hi>Galilee,</hi> Besieges, takes and burns <hi>Gadara</hi> and <hi>Jotapata; Tiberias</hi> does of it self surrender; <hi>Terichee</hi> having held out a <hi>Siege,</hi> is taken by force, and utterly destroyed. And whilst other <hi>Towns</hi> in <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Palestin</hi> yield to the Conqueror, the <hi>Jews</hi> divide themselves into 2 Factions; the one being for <hi>War,</hi> and the others being as earnest for <hi>Peace.</hi> The <hi>Countries</hi> are filled with <hi>Robbers,</hi> who laden with <hi>Spoil</hi> taken from the Peaceable, come to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and fill it with <hi>Disorders, Discords, Violences, Murthers,</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi> These <hi>Zealots,</hi> (for so did they call themselves) being besieged by the People in the <hi>Temple,</hi> call in the <hi>Idume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to their assistance, who entring with 20000 <hi>Men</hi> into the <hi>City,</hi> make there a great Slaughter. <hi>Vespasian</hi> being moved by these Disorders, prepares himself for the Siege of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and removes all hindrances: Yet on the News of <hi>Nero</hi>'s death, and that of <hi>Galba,</hi> who had succeeded him, he thinks fitting with <hi>Titus</hi> his Son to temporize a while, which gives the <hi>Jews</hi> leisure to take Breath. which they only used to their mutual Ruin. <hi>Otho,</hi> who had succeeded <hi>Galba,</hi> having been also killed, and <hi>Vitellus</hi> being entred into <hi>Italy</hi> to succeed them, the Troops of <hi>Vespasian</hi> salute him <hi>Emperor,</hi> and his Party having prevail'd at <hi>Cremona,</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> against <hi>Vitellus,</hi> who was killed, he Embarks at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and charges his Son <hi>Titus</hi> with the care of the <hi>War</hi> of <hi>Judea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was full of Factions, which raged every day more violently against one another. <hi>Titus</hi> parts from <hi>Caesarea</hi> a while before <hi>Easter,</hi> and comes and sits down before the <hi>Town,</hi> which he attacks with great Vigor, hindring all persons from going out thence, and any thing to be carryed into it; the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Famine</hi> did also there rage; that from the 14th of <hi>April,</hi> when the <hi>Siege</hi> began, were Buried or cast into Holes, above 600000 Persons, which had perished either thro <hi>Hunger</hi> or <hi>Sickness.</hi> In fine, the <hi>City</hi> being Attacked on all sides from the 5th of <hi>July,</hi> all was submitted to the Victorious, and burnt down to the ground; as to the <hi>Temple,</hi> on the 10th of <hi>August,</hi> tho <hi>Titus</hi> did what he could to preserve it; and as to the rest of the <hi>Town,</hi> the 8th of <hi>September,</hi> these Wretches being to be brought by no means to any Composition. There were made 97000 <hi>Prisoners,</hi> and 1100000 Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons died during the <hi>Siege. John</hi> and <hi>Simon,</hi> Chief of the <hi>Factions,</hi> were found hid in the common <hi>Jakes;</hi> and 2000 others, who chose rather to kill one another, or dye with <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> than to surrender themselves. Several <hi>Prodigies</hi> had preceeded this Disaster; A <hi>Man</hi> for several years together had run about the <hi>Street,</hi> crying incessantly, <hi>Voice of the East, Voice of the West, Voice of the four Winds, Voice against</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>against the Temple, and against all the People;</hi> there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could hinder him, and crying (as he was wont) during the <hi>Siege</hi> on the <hi>Wall, Misery to the City, People, and Temple,</hi> he was struck with a <hi>Stone</hi> out of a <hi>Sling,</hi> and feeling himself mortally wounded, he added to his Cry these words, in expiring, <hi>Woe be also to me.</hi> A <hi>Comet</hi> in the form of a <hi>Sword</hi> glistered for a year together over the Town; of a <hi>Cow</hi> led to the <hi>Altar</hi> sprang a <hi>Lamb.</hi> A Year before the <hi>Siege</hi> in the <hi>Feast</hi> of <hi>Easter</hi> a great <hi>Light</hi> shined in the <hi>Temple</hi> and about the <hi>Altar,</hi> at 9 at Night, and continued for half an hour.

                     <p>THe Times wherein any one of the <hi>Prophets</hi> lived, may easily be here seen; so that to pass over those whereof mention is made in the Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> as <hi>Samuel, Gad, Nathan, Iddo,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Elisha;</hi> the Time of whose Lives are very apparent from the <hi>Kings</hi> under whom they lived: It will be sufficient to take notice of those whose <hi>Writings</hi> we have extant, and at the same time, the particular <hi>Ages</hi> wherein they flourished will be found in this ensuing Table.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>JONAS began to Prophecy under <hi>Joash,</hi> Father of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the 2d, King of <hi>Israel. Anno Mundi</hi> 3116.</item>
                        <item>HOSEA, under <hi>Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who were Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> King of <hi>Israel.</hi> A. M. 3194.</item>
                        <item>JOEL, under the same Kings as <hi>Hosea,</hi> and not for as long a time.</item>
                        <item>AMOS began to Prophecy in <hi>Israel</hi> the 23d year of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> and continued so for 28 years. <hi>A. M.</hi> 3217.</item>
                        <item>ISAIAH Prophecied in <hi>Judah</hi> the 25th year of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> and continued under <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> The Tradition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and some of the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> is, That <hi>Manasses</hi> (the Son of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>) put him to death; so that he must needs have Prophecied one whole Age. <hi>A. M.</hi> 3219.</item>
                        <item>OBADIAH Prophecied in <hi>Israel,</hi> the same time as <hi>Isaiah</hi> in <hi>Judah.</hi> A. M. 3249.</item>
                        <item>MICAH was under <hi>Jotham, Ahaz</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Kings of <hi>Judah;</hi> and it seems to have been about this time, that <hi>Jonas</hi> was sent to <hi>Nineveh.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>NAHUM began to Prophecy after that the 10 <hi>Tribes</hi> were carried away Captive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Babylon,</hi> as well to <hi>comfort</hi> those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, as those that were carried away. <hi>A. M.</hi> 3291.</item>
                        <item>JEREMIAH began to Prophecy in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> in the 13th year of <hi>Josiah,</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied for 45 years. Being afterwards carried into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he was there <hi>Stoned</hi> to death. <hi>A. M.</hi> 3375.</item>
                        <item>BARUCH was also of the same time, and tho he was of a very great <hi>Family,</hi> yet he served him as <hi>Secretary.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>ZEPHANIAH, and HABAKKUK<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were also of the same time.</item>
                        <item>DANIEL began to Prophecy in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when yet in a manner but a Child, under <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> and continu'd until the time of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that is to say, about the 85th year of his Age; and tho he obtain'd by his <hi>Prayers</hi> the accomplishment of his <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> for the deliverance of the <hi>People;</hi> yet it seems probable, he died in this strange Country without ever returning into <hi>Judea, Anno Mundi</hi> 3398.</item>
                        <item>EZEKIEL (who was of the Race of the <hi>Priests,</hi> and one of those carried Captive, together with <hi>Jechoniah,</hi> by King <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar</hi>) began 5 years after to prophecy at <hi>Babilon,</hi> and so continued 22 years. A. M. 3409.</item>
                        <item>HAGGAI Prophecied in <hi>Judah</hi> upon the Return of the <hi>People</hi> from <hi>Captivity,</hi> and rebuk'd them for being too slow in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building the <hi>Temple,</hi> A. M. 3485.</item>
                        <item>ZACHARIAH was of the same time.</item>
                        <item>MALACHY was the last of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and seems to have been of the same time, with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that is, towards the end of the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus;</hi> (<hi>A. M.</hi> 3550) So that the whole time of the <hi>Prophets</hi> seems to have been above 400 years.</item>

                     <p>
                        <hi>It is observable, That of all the</hi> Sages <hi>of</hi> Greece, <hi>so celebrated in</hi> Ethnick Antiquity, <hi>not one flourish'd till after the time of the</hi> Prophets. Pythagoras <hi>himself went to</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, <hi>and learned many things of the</hi> Jews, <hi>which he made use of in his</hi> Philosphy <hi>and</hi> Plato <hi>also, who inserted many things out of the Books of</hi> Moses <hi>into his, was near</hi> 200 <hi>years after all.</hi>
