         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <salute>Much Honoured Couſins,</salute>
            <p>IT is not any Ambition to appear in Print,
that hath induced me to this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking;
Only I could not handſomly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the Dedication of this Poſthumous
Piece, and Preſenting it to your Hands, who
have ſo clear and unqueſtionable a Right to
it, as will appear by the Sequel. I preſume
you are not ignorant, that it was really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and deſigned for you by the Reverend
Author, (now at Reſt with the Lord) your
dear Brother and mine; Who, (had he
not been prevented by Death) had done it
with his own Hand: but perceiving the
<pb facs="tcp:59219:6"/>
Printing of this Book procraſtinated beyond
his Expectation, and being dayly ſenſible of
his near approaching and long expected
Change, it was his deſire that I would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it in his behalf; and indeed it was
one of the last requests he made to me before
he left the World. I doubt not then, but what I
have done herein, will be well conſtrued and
kindly accepted, when it is done in purſuance
of ſo honeſt a Deſign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; to gratifie the juſt &amp;
reaſonable Deſire of ſo near and dear a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who (on his Death-bed) bequeath'd
this Legacy as a Teſtimony of his unfeigned
Brotherly-Love, and Memorial of his real
Gratitude to you his dear Dear Siſters, who
had not been forgetful of him, but oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and refreſhed him by your Kind and
Chriſtian like Viſits, in his Low and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
Condition.</p>
            <p>As for the Subject of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
You will eaſily grant, it is very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and needful as for all Times, ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
theſe laſt and worſt Times, wherein
Worldlineſs ſo much prevails &amp; gets ground
of Godlineſs even in the Hearts and Lives
of thoſe that call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
whereas did they truly anſwer the Name
they bear, what would it ſpeak elſe, but their
<pb facs="tcp:59219:6"/>
Conformity to Chriſt, and not to the World.</p>
            <p>The Words of the <hi>Apoſtle, 1. Cor.</hi> 7. 29.
30, 31. deſerve ſeriouſly to be taken, and
laid to heart by every Chriſtian: Where, to
take us off the extreams of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi>
in the Poſſeſſing, or Parting with Earthly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and Worldly Comforts, he tells us,
<hi>The faſhion of this World paſſeth away:</hi>
and yet notwithſtanding, how do we find
by Woful Experience, the Hearts of too many
drawn away and enticed through the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy
of <hi>Worldly Luſts,</hi> that this
is their chiefeſt ſtudy how to keep in with the
World by Faſhioning and Conforming the
dayly Actions of their Lives according to
the Rules and Patterns of it? And herein,
how do they ſeek to out-vye and out-ſtripeach
other with ſo great Emulation and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(when their Lives and the World are
hastning to an end) as if it were their
higheſt Ambition to live and dye the Werld's
Favorites? But, certainly if there were a
through and ſound Belief of a Life and
World to come, after this preſent frail and
tranſitory State of all things here below,
how would it turn the Stream and Current
of Mens Thoughts and Affections, and have
a powerful Influence on their Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations,
<pb facs="tcp:59219:7"/>
to make them more Godly, &amp; leſs
Worldly; and from this very Conſideration
(2 Pet. 3. 11.) the Apoſtle argues ſtrongly
for a Holy and Godly Converſation, and
not a Worldly Conformity. But our <hi>Saviour</hi>
himſelf hath foretoldus (and therefore we
may and muſt believe it) that towards the
end of the World it will be a rare thing to
find true Faith, <hi>(Luk.</hi> 18. 8.) that Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Grace which, St. <hi>John</hi> tells us. (1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
5. 4.) overcometh the World and the Luſts
thereof.</p>
            <p>But (dear Couſins) I am perſwaded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things of you, and ſuch as accompany
Salvation. You have been happy above ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
in reſpect of your Education, having
been acquainted with Sound Principles of
Godlineſs from your tender years, through
the Care and Diligence of your Religious
Parents. And although there are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to be found in theſe times, between whoſe
Principles and Practices there is little or no
Conformity, but the one is rather a plain
Confutation of the other; I hope you will
never be found in that number: for that
precious Seed of good Principles which was
ſown in your Minority, was not (it ſeems)
burned and laſt, but hath (through Gods
<pb facs="tcp:59219:7"/>
Bleſſing with a continual watering) budded
and brought forth ſeaſonable and wholeſom
Fruit for the Comfort and Refreſhing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which hath occaſioned (no doubt) the
Thanks-giving of many to God on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
And if God hath given you, (with
a large and plentiful Eſtate) a large Heart
and open Hand to do good, it is a double
Bleſſing, and lays a double Obligation upon
you to be thankful.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe the beſt Chriſtians need day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Monitors to warn them of Dangers, and
to awaken them to Duty and the continual
Exerciſe of their Graces; give me leave as
a faithful Friend to beſeech you to keep in
remembrance, and ſeriouſly to ponder what
the Apoſtle writes to <hi>Timothy</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.
17. 18, 19.) The more Splendid your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Condition is, the greater is the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
you are expoſed unto, from the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of a Smiling &amp; Flattering World,
which being masked &amp; vetled, are not eaſily
known and diſcovered; which if they were,
would more eaſily be reſiſted, and were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo dangerous. They that by Experience
know what a tempting thing <hi>Worldly
Grandeur</hi> is, and have any acquaintance
with their own hearts, how apt they are to

is none of the eaſieſt Points of that difficult
Duty of Chriſtian Self-denial, for thoſe
that have arrived at the Haven of Worldly
hopes, to keep their Hearts humble from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lifted up with Self-admiring thoughts,
when their outward Greatneſs and Splendor
invites others to applaud and admire them.
And indeed it will put the <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to the greateſt Streſs, and prove not only
the Truth but the Strength thereof, when, in
the midſt of Worldly Enjoyments, they can
look above them to higher and better; and in
the midſt of Worldly Greatneſs, can live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
it in the Soul-raviſhing View of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Glory. It muſt needs be then a Mercy
worth the asking, and a Leſſon worth the
learning, to have our Hearts looſed from
all outward Comforts before Hand, and to
leave and part with them in affection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are called to part with them indeed,
(ſeeing there will be a time of parting and
we enjoy them on no other, but parting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms)
and then, whenſoever they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from us, or we from them, the trouble
of parting will not be great. But to detain

            <p>THE words conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
are either words of,
<hi>Counſel,</hi> iſſuing from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's

<hi>Caution,</hi> iſſuing from the Apoſtle's Care
and Love; or words of <hi>Command,</hi> iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Apoſtle's Authority: <hi>Be not

            </p>
            <p>We will conſider them as a prohibitive
Precept, wherein we have</p>
            <p>1. The Act forbidden, and that is
<hi>Conformity.</hi>

an Age wherein Sin and Corruption did
more abound. But we ſhall take it more
largely; ſo, <hi>this World,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed

It's ſaid of <hi>Demas,</hi> That <hi>he embraced this

not being in the world, nor uſing of the

that is forbid.</p>
            <p>There are two great things the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                  <item>2. Imitating of it, and conforming

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59219:15"/>
In handling of it, we ſhall ſpeak to four
things:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The</hi> Explication.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The</hi> Confirmation.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The</hi> Vindication.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>The</hi> Application.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. For <hi>Explication;</hi> ſo two things come
to be opened:
<list>
                  <item>I. What is meant by <hi>the world</hi> to
which Chriſtians are not to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. What is meant by being a <hi>Non-Conformiſt</hi>
to <hi>this world.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. What is meant by <hi>the world</hi> that
Chriſtians are not to <hi>conform</hi> to. To let
paſs the ſeveral acceptions of the <hi>world</hi>
in Scripture, It may be underſtood either
of the Frame or Family of the World.</p>
            <p>1. For the Frame; ſo for what the
world conſiſts of; ſo for the Heavens and
Earth, and the things contained in them,
<hi>Heb. 1. 2. By whom alſo he made the world.</hi>
So it is not here underſtood.</p>
            <p>2. The Family of the world; ſo the
<hi>world</hi> is taken for the perſons that inhabit
this lower world, the Earth: and ſo in
Scripture, for the wicked of the world,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59219:16"/>
1 <hi>Joh. 5. 19. The world lieth in wickedneſs.</hi>
Where by the <hi>world</hi> is not underſtood the
Frame, but the Family and men of the
world; who by a ſpecial appellation in
Scripture are ſtiled <hi>the men of the world,</hi>
Pſal 17. 14. and the <hi>children of this world,</hi>
Luke 16. 8.</p>
            <p>And the reaſons why they are called the
world, are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. The worſt are the moſt of the world,
they take up moſt room in the world; the
Godly are a little Flock. Who can num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the duſt of Atheiſts, Swearers, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
Sabbath-breakers, Covetous, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane?
How few are thoſe that fear an
Oath, to thoſe that ſwear? How few are
thoſe that ſanctiſie a Sabbath, to thoſe that
prophane it? How few are thoſe that call
upon the Name of the Lord, to thoſe that
blaſpheme his Name? How few are thoſe
that fear God, to thoſe that fear him
not?</p>
            <p>2. The worſt are for the moſt part the
greateſt of the world, they are the moſt
flouriſhing part of, and people in the
world; and they are the world's own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
whom the world loves, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſaith, <hi>The world will love its own.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59219:16"/>
They are the Diamonds of the world, and
the godly are but the Pebbles, They are
the perſons in eſteem, when the godly are
accounted the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, off-ſcowring
of the world. They are the men that
have moſt worldly wiſdom, moſt worldly
wealth, moſt worldly honour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called the world.</p>
            <p>3. The worſt are called the world in
regard of affection; they love the world,
and the things of the world. They ſavour
the things of the world, and ſavour of the
world; they ſmell of the world, as <hi>Eſau</hi>'s
garments did of the Field. The ſaying is,
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num quodque illud eſt quod amat;</hi> every
thing is that it loves. Affections work a
change, eſpecially that of love, which in
a manner changes one into the perſon or
thing loved. Hence it is the worſt are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the world.</p>
            <p>4. The worſt are called the world, in
reſpect of Converſation; they are <hi>carnali
converſatione Mundo dediti,</hi> as an Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
ſaith, they are wholly addicted to,
and given up to the world; the world is
the Principle from which, and the End
for which they act; they riſe no higher
in their converſation, than the world; their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59219:17"/>
converſation is not in Heaven; they do
all carnally; ſo they eat, and ſo they
drink; ſo they live, and ſo they dye; and
therefore called the world.</p>
            <p>5. The worſt are called the world, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are all for the world; for the
Riches, and Pleaſures, and Profits, and
Vanities of this preſent world. If they
can have but thoſe things, they care for
no more. They make the world their reſt;
they muſt have the things of the world,
or elſe they dye. Give them the things of
the world, and it ſufficeth. The things of
another world, they mind not, they deſire
not, they ſeek not after. What they look
after and covet, lies below. As the Duke
of <hi>Alva,</hi> when he was asked by the King
of <hi>France,</hi> Whether he had ſeen a great
Eclipſe that was of the Sun? Replied,
That he had ſo much to do on Earth, that
he could not have while to look up to
Heaven. So it is with theſe; a Portion in
this life, and in this world, is the higheſt
in their eſteem; as that prophane Duke of
<hi>Burbon</hi> ſaid, He preferr'd his part in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
before his part in <hi>Paradice.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account the worſt are called the
world; and this is that world that is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59219:17"/>
chiefly meant, to which Chriſtians are to
be <hi>Non-conformiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for the firſt.</p>
            <p>II. Conſider, What it is to be a <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt</hi>
to the world: ſo, in handling that,
we ſhall do two things:</p>
            <p>1. Shew you wherein <hi>Conformity</hi> to the
world ſtands.</p>
            <p>2. Wherein <hi>Nonconformity</hi> ſtands; and
ſo ſhall ſhew you what it is to be a <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi>
and a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> to this world.</p>
            <p>The words in the Original are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which <hi>Beza</hi> renders the <hi>Configure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi>
Be not <hi>configured</hi> to the world. Some
render them (and ſo the <hi>Vulgar), Nolite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formari,
Be not conformed,</hi> as here in the
Text. The words may be rendered, Be
not <hi>figured</hi> or <hi>faſhioned</hi> according to this
world, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 14. Not faſhioning your
ſelves, &amp;c.</hi> where the word is the ſame in
the Original, with that in the Text. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done this, I now come to ſhew
wherein</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Conformity</hi> to the world ſtands.
<hi>Conformity</hi> ſuppoſeth and implies a
pattern to which one doth <hi>conform.</hi>
What is <hi>Conformity</hi> but a walking or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59219:18"/>
working by a Rule or Pattern, out of a
ſtudy and deſire to imitate it? So <hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
to Chriſt ſtands in the imitating and
following the Pattern that Chriſt hath left
us, and writing after the Copy he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us; treading in his ſteps, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21.
<hi>Leaving us an example, that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his ſteps.</hi> So conformity to the world
ſtands in treading in the world's ſteps,
writing after the world's Copy, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the world's example. The world
hath its <hi>Tables,</hi> which it hangs forth for a
pattern of Conformity to others. It hath
its Samplers, wherein is a deſcription of
its actions, for the imitation of others.
There is a Scheme and Figure of the
world, according to which it wonld have
all to faſhion themſelves. It knows that
man is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Creature that is apt
to imitate, who will be working according
to ſome Pattern or other; and therefore
hath its Patterns of all ſorts, which it
hangs forth to gain his Conformity. So
then there are two things that make up
conformity to the world, and that make
a man a <hi>Conformiſt</hi> to the world.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Approbation.</item>
               <item>2. Imitation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59219:18"/>
1. <hi>Approbation;</hi> when a man in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
approves of the world's Principles
and Practiſes, concluding that beſt that
the moſt of the world ſay and do; That
the world's way of worſhipping God, is
the beſt way; That the world's way to
Heaven is the eaſieſt way, <hi>and therefore to
be choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Imitation:</hi> This follows upon <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation:</hi>
He likes the Copy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reſolves to write after it. He likes the
Pattern, and reſolves to imitate it. As it
is in writing, we firſt look on it, and like
the Hand-writing, and then there is a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Pen in hand to write like it. In a
word, Conforming to the World ſtands in
this, When a man is inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
not what God, but the world
would have him to be. When a man
judgeth as the world judgeth, thinks as
the world thinks, ſpeaks as the world
ſpeaks, acts as the world acts, loveth as
the world loveth, delights as the world
delights, hates as the world hates. When
a man's carriage and diſpoſition is the
the ſame with the men of the world;
when a man maketh the rule of his life to
be the ſinful Manners, Cuſtoms, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59219:19"/>
of the world, and ſalves all with
worldly diſtinctions and limitations.</p>
            <p>II. What <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the World
is, and what it is to be a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> to
the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the World conſiſts of
theſe things:</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the World in
<hi>Judgment.</hi> He that is a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> to
the world, muſt judg of things otherways
than the world doth. The world calls
evil good, and good evil; the world puts
darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs;
the world thinks the ways of God une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
the ſervice of God burthenſome,
the Servants of God fools, the Miniſters
of God illiterate Dunces, Religion it ſelf
irrational: It thinks Holineſs ſingularity;
and ſtrictneſs and preciſeneſs in the ways
of God, to be fooliſh ſcrupuloſities. It
thinks great ſins little ones, and little ſins
to be none at all. It thinks Repentance
and Salvation to be the eaſieſt things in
the world, and that the way to Heaven
is not ſo hard as the Scripture makes it.
What a low opinion hath the world of
ſin, judging is not to be ſo evil as it is?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59219:19"/>
What a low opinion hath the world of
Grace, thinking it not to be ſo excellent
as it is? What a low opinion hath the
World of Chriſt, thinking him not to be
ſo neceſſary, amiable, and deſirable, as he
is? What a low opinion hath the world
of Heavenly things, and the great things
of Eternity, thinking them not to be of
that everlaſting concernment as they are?
What a low opinion have they of the
Saints of God, thinking them not to be
ſo excellent and uſeful as they are? What
a low opinion have they of Religious
Duties and Ordinances, thinking them
not to be ſo neceſſary, ſweet, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
as they are? So this is the firſt
thing, Wherein a Chriſtian is to be a <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt</hi>
to this World, In point of
<hi>Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> He muſt judg of things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
than the World judgeth.</p>
            <p>2. A Chriſtian muſt be a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi>
to the World, in reſpect of <hi>Affection.</hi> He
muſt have his Affections ſet upon higher
objects than thoſe things the affections of
worldly men are ſet upon; he muſt be
unlike the world in his love, deſires, and
delight. The World loves nothing but
what is like it ſelf; none but thoſe in whom
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59219:20"/>
it eſpieth its own conditions and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
he muſt be unlike the world in his
ſorrow, grief, and mourning, which is for
worldly croſſes, not for ſin; it mourns
more for the Effect, than the Cauſe. The
Affections of the World run with a byaſs
towards the World; they are all edged
and pointed downwards; they always
face ſome Worldly Object. And in this
particular a Chriſtian is to be a <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt</hi>
to the World.</p>
            <p>3. A Chriſtian muſt be a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi>
to the World in reſpect of <hi>Practice.</hi> A
Chriſtian muſt not do as the World doth;
he muſt not conform to the World in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of its
<list>
                  <item>Rules,</item>
                  <item>Examples.</item>
               </list>
He muſt not walk by the <hi>Rules</hi> the World
walks by: He muſt not imitate the ſame
Patterns: the life of a Chriſtian muſt be
a life ordered by the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi>
of the Word, not of the World. His
Principles from which he acts, his Rules
and Precepts by which he acts, and his
Ends for which he acts, muſt be higher
than the World.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the <hi>Explication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59219:20"/>
II. For the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the truth
of the Doctrine: So conſider the grounds
and reaſons, Why Chriſtians muſt be <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts</hi>
to the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are to be <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to
the world in reſpect of their <hi>Calling.</hi> A
Chriſtian's Calling, and his Conformity to
the world, cannot conſiſt nor ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
To make this out, conſider
<list>
                  <item>1. What a Chriſtian is called from.</item>
                  <item>2. What a Chriſtian is called to.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. What a Chriſtian is called from. He
is called from the world, he is called out
of the world; and ſo he is called from a
conformity to the world: John 15. 19. <hi>I
have choſen you out of the world.</hi> The
Church is deſcribed to be a company of
faithful ones, choſen and called out of
the world. Now, What is this calling out
of the world? It is not calling them from
living in the world. It is not calling them
from uſing of the world; it is not calling
them from all converſing with the world;
but it is a calling them from conforming to
the world, Rev. 18. 4. <hi>Come out of her my
people; (i. e.)</hi> Have nothing to do with <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>'s
Manners, and ſinful Cuſtoms, and
corrupt Forms of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59219:21"/>
2. Conſider what Chriſtians are called
to, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1. 3. they are ſaid to be called to
<hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> Chriſtians are called to
Holineſs and Happineſs. And upon this
account he muſt not be a Conformiſt to
this world.</p>
            <p>1. He is called to Holineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15,
16. <hi>Be ye holy.</hi> Now Holineſs conſiſteth
not with conforming to the world; the
world is unclean, impure, unholy; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
5. 19. <hi>The world lieth in wickedneſs;</hi> it
lies like a Beaſt in its own dung and filth.
Conforming to the world, is being like
the world, and bearing the image of the
world; and ſo it is to bear the image of
that that is unholy and unclean. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
is called to bear another image; he is
called to be like God. But none can bear
the Image of God, and the Image of the
world too. God is infinitely holy; and he
that will be like to a holy God, muſt be
unlike an unholy world: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 27. it is
there made one part of that Religion that
is ſaid to be pure and undefiled, <hi>For a man
to keep himſelf unſpotted of the world:</hi>
which ſhews that the world is a beſpotting
and defiling thing. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. we read
of the pollutions of the world. If you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59219:21"/>
look upon that Scheam and Figure of the
world that St. <hi>John</hi> hath drawn, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.
16. you will find, whatever is in the
world, is all luſt. So <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. we read
of worldly luſts. And if you will ſee
what the way, and courſe, and practice of
the world is, you have it in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of Riot, Drunkenneſs, Revelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
So then it cannot be, that a Chriſtian's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called to holineſs, can conſiſt with a
conforming to this world.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſtians are called to Glory. As
to Holineſs, ſo to Happineſs. Now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to glory, and conforming to the
world, cannot ſtand together. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.
24. <hi>The way of life is above to the wiſe.</hi>
That way that leads to glory, lyes above
the world. Thoſe Principles from which
a man acts, thoſe Rules by which a man
acts, and thoſe Ends for which a man acts,
that acts for Heaven, and ſeeks for Glory
and Immortality, are all higher Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Rules, and Ends, than thoſe of the
world, and far above them. The world's
way will never bring a man to glory; it
may bring a man to worldly Honour and
Preferment, but will never mount a man
to the enjoyment of the things of that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59219:22"/>
world that is to come. The world hath
kept many from Heaven, and is ſtill the
great block and hinderance in the way to
Heaven. How many have the curſed
courſes and examples of the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
and damned? And how often doth
the Scripture cautionate all to take heed
of the world as a dangerous Rock, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which a thouſand <hi>Dema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> have
daſhed themſelves, and made ſhipwrack
of Faith and a good Conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider ſome particular
grounds, Why Chriſtians are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts</hi>
to the world.</p>
            <p>1. Conformity to God and the World,
cannot ſtand together, no more than the
love of God and the love of the World
can, 1 Joh. 2. 15. <hi>If any man love the world,
the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> There
is an antipathy and contrariety between
God and the World. A man is never more
like God, than when he is moſt unlike the
World. Now a Chriſtian is to conform to
God and Chriſt. The <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>beſt,</hi> is ſaid
to be the Rule of the reſt. Chriſt is our
higheſt and beſt Pattern. Here is no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of two Maſters; no conforming to
two contrary Patterns. He that will be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59219:22"/>
a <hi>Conformiſt</hi> to the World, muſt be a
<hi>Non-conformiſt</hi> to God and Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. The world is one of the declared
Enemies that a Chriſtian is to fight againſt:
worldly luſts, as well as fieſhly luſts, fight
againſt the ſoul; ſo that conforming to the
world is taking part and ſiding with our
Enemy. The Apoſtle ſaith <hi>(Gal.</hi> 6. 14.),
<hi>The world is crucified to me, and I to the
world; (q. d.)</hi> The world and I are upon
equal terms of defiance; I neither care for
the would, nor the world for me.</p>
            <p>3. Chriſtians are predeſtinated to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Conformity than that to the world:
Rom, 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>9. <hi>For whom he did fore-know, he
alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the
image of his Son.</hi> Not to the Image of the
world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Conformity to the world conſiſts
not with that Predeſtination.</p>
            <p>4. What was a Chriſtian's Rule and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
before converſion, cannot be his Rule
after. Before converſion the world was
ſo: <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. The Apoſtle tells the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
that before converſion they walked
according to the courſe of the world.</p>
            <p>5. It was one end of Chriſt's living ſo
long on earth, to give us a better and a
more noble Pattern and Example, than
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59219:23"/>
what the world gave, 1 Pet. 2. 21. <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us an example, that we ſhould follow
his ſteps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. It is a debaſement to a Chriſtian to
be a <hi>Conformiſt</hi> to the world. The
ground of Conformity and Imitation,
ſhould be to advance and better; but in
conforming to the world, a Chriſtian doth
but degrade himſelf; he writes after a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
by which he cannot mend his hand. It
is obſervable in Scripture, what the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the world are compared to; among
Beaſts, to I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yons, Bears, Wolves; among
Plants, to Briers, Thorns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Among
other living Creatures, to Vipers, Dogs,
Swine. What a debaſement is it for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to be like ſuch, to wallow as a Sow
in the mire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. The <hi>Vindication</hi> of the truth. So
the queſtion is this, <hi>Whether all conformity
to this world be unlawful?</hi> And the reaſon
of the queſtion is this, Becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaking of the faſhion of the world,
(1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29.) he makes Marrying, and
Weeping, and Rejoicing, and Poſſeſſing,
to be ſome of the faſhions of the world.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59219:23"/>
So the queſtion is, <hi>Whether all conformity
to the world in theſe its faſhions, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We muſt here diſtinguiſh of the
Manners, Cuſtoms, and Faſhions of the
World; ſo they are of three ſorts:
<list>
                  <item>1. Some are Civil.</item>
                  <item>2. Some are Sinful.</item>
                  <item>3. Some are Doubtful.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. There are the Civil Cuſtoms, Manners,
and Faſhions of the world; and concerning
them, I anſwer, That all conformity to the
world in thoſe, is not unlawful; as to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to weep, to rejoyce, to buy, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs,
is not unlawful; yet I muſt tell you,
that all conformity to the world, even in
theſe things, is not lawful: For conſider,
Even in things that are lawful, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a Chriſtian to be ſuch in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
uſe, and enjoyment of thoſe things,
as the moſt of the world are; and therefore
the Scripture, when it treats of thoſe
things which are in themſelves lawful, yet
it ſets thoſe bounds and limits to Chriſtians
which the World obſerves not. It calls
upon Chriſtians to have their affections ſet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59219:24"/>
on things above the world; to be ſober in
uſing the things of this world; to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
while they are in this world, they are
almoſt come to the end of the world; and
ſo to uſe the world, as thoſe that look for
another world: to look upon this preſent
world, as that that will ſhortly be the
world paſt; and to look upon the world
to come, as that that will ſhortly be the
world preſent, all the days of Eternity. I
ſhall give you two places of Scripture,
wherein Chriſtians are forbid to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
to the world even in theſe things;
One is 1 Pet. 4. 7. <hi>The end of all things is
at hand, be ye ſober.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
it's diverſly rendred; but here its taken
for <hi>ſober-mindedneſs:</hi> Sobriety, properly
taken, is a moderation of the Appetite
about eating and drinking: but here it is
put for the moderation of the Affections
about the world, and the things of the
world: The ſobriety there enjoined, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 Modeſty</item>
               <item>2 Moderation
<list>
                     <item>of Mind.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Modeſty of Mind:</hi> So Rom. 12. 13.
<hi>Let no man think more highly of himſelf
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59219:24"/>
than he ought to think, but think</hi> ſoberly
<hi>of himſelf,</hi> &amp;c Where Sobriety is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to pride of heart. And in this a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
muſt be a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> to the world.
He may marry a Wife, but muſt not be
proud of a Wife; he may purchaſe, but
not be proud of his Purchaſe; he may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs,
but not be proud of his Poſſeſſion.
Now this is the way of the world, to be
proud of all their enjoyments; and in this
Chriſtians are not to conform to it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Moderation of Mind:</hi> And ſo Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is oppoſed to letting out the heart and
affections too much upon the world: and
this is the ſobriety that is called for, and
wherein Chriſtians muſt be unlike the
world. It is not this that Chriſtians are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to, To give over marrying, and
poſſeſſing, and uſing the things of this
world; but to be moderate in the uſe of
them, and therein to be unlike the world.
And it is obſervable what reaſon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
gives for this Sobriety in the place
fore-mentioned, <hi>viz. The end of all things
is at hand.</hi> An end of all the Civil Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
Faſhions, and Manners of the world;
an end of Marrying, Buying, Poſſeſſing;
an end of Building, Planting, Eating, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59219:25"/>
Drinking; an end of all Worldly Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
Employments, and Enjoyments.
And this he makes the reaſon why Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſhould be ſober and moderate in theſe
things, and herein to be unlike the
world.</p>
            <p>The other Scripture is 1 Cor. 7. 29. 30.
<hi>This I ſay, Brethren, the time is ſhort,</hi> &amp;c.
Conſider, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had written to
the Apoſtle to be reſolved in divers caſes;
and among others, ſome concerning Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:
To which the Apoſtle gives an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
in that Chapter, telling them, he could
not give an abſolute determination what
was to be done; but he did ſuppoſe that
this and that was beſt; and then addeth,
<hi>But this I ſay, brethren,</hi> &amp;c. as if he ſhould
ſay, The queſtions are difficult, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
(it may be) you will find doubtful;
but this I can tell you of certainty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>if<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> and <hi>and's,</hi> poſitively and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
and of which you need not doubt;
<hi>Brethren, the time is ſhort; Let thoſe that
have Wives, be as though they had none,</hi> &amp;c.
The meaning is, that a Chriſtian is to have
his heart above all Creature-comforts, and
all Creature-croſſes; and in this, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are to be unlike the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59219:25"/>
Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let them that have
Wives, be as though they had none.</hi> Now he
that hath a Wife, hath two things:</p>
            <p>1. A great deal of <hi>comfort.</hi> A Wife is
a ſecond ſelf, one that a man can make a
partaker of all his contentments, and who
will be a ſharer with him in all his croſſes
(ſuppoſing her to be a good Wife).</p>
            <p>2. A great many <hi>cares. Such</hi> (ſaith the
Apoſtle) <hi>as are married, ſhall have trouble
in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 28. Now when the
Apoſtle ſaith, That ſuch as have Wives,
muſt be as though they had none; the
meaning is, they muſt moderate their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in that enjoyment, that they be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taken too much with the comforts,
nor vext too much with the croſſes in a
Wife. And ſo for the reſt, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaks of weeping, and rejoycing, and
poſſeſſing, that we ſhould be as though we
wept not, and rejoyced not, and poſſeſſed
not; the meaning is, that we ſhould ſtill
remember, that there are greater things to
be wept for, and to be rejoyced in, than
the things of this World; and greater
Poſſeſſions to be ſought after, than the
Poſſeſſions of this life: and then obſerve
the Apoſtle's Motives to enforce this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59219:26"/>
1. <hi>The time is ſhort: Tempus eſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi>
ſo <hi>Beza;</hi> The time is contracted, it
is drawn into a narrow compaſs. The <hi>Greek</hi>
word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies ſuch a
contraction and drawing in, as of Sailors,
as is uſed by Sea-men and Boat-men when
they draw near to ſhore. Some refer it to
the time of life; ſo that the Apoſtle's
meaning is, That <hi>the time of life is ſhort.</hi>
Thoſe that lived in the firſt Ages of the
world, had their lives drawn out, the
thread of their lives was ſpun out longer;
they by the courſe of Nature lived Six
hundred, Seven hundred, Eight hundred
years; ſo they might have their thoughts
more buſied about the world, in peopling
Countreys, in marrying Wives, in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the time of their life was
long: but now <hi>the time is ſhort;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſtians are ſo to uſe the world, as
thoſe that muſt ſhortly leave it.</p>
            <p>Others think the Apoſtle (when he ſaith
<hi>the time is ſhort)</hi> means the time of the
World's being and continuance, is ſhort:
that God is gathering in the Sails of Time,
and that the end of the World is at hand;
it is not long that there will be no more
marrying, no more weeping, no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59219:26"/>
no more poſſeſſing in this world,
becauſe the time of the world's being is
ſhort. This is the Apoſtle's firſt Reaſon,
why we ſhould be moderate in theſe
things.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond Motive is, <hi>The faſhion of
the world goeth away:</hi> And as the other led
the Van, ſo this brings up the Reer of the
Exhortation; the <hi>Greek</hi> word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the <hi>Scheam,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Figure, only external and accidental,
without ſubſtance: The Vulgar renders it
<hi>Figura,</hi> the Figure of the World: <hi>Beza</hi>
renders it <hi>Species,</hi> the Show of the World:
Some think the Apoſtle therein alludes to
a Comedy, or a Shew upon a Stage, which
is but a ſhew or appearance; ſo all the
things of the world are but a ſhew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
there is no true ſolidity orreality
in them: and then obſerve he ſaith, <hi>It paſſeth
away,</hi> to ſhew that the World is upon Gate
and Motion; it hath been ſome thouſands
of years paſſing by us, and the Reer of it
is coming up, and it will not be long ere
the World and all the faſhions of it (as
Marrying, Weeping, Rejoycing, Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<hi>&amp;c.)</hi> will be paſt and gone. Though
its now the faſhion of the world,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59219:27"/>
yet ere long theſe things will be no more.</p>
            <p>The ſum of all that I have been ſpeaking
to, is this, That though Chriſtians may be
<hi>Conformiſts</hi> to the world in theſe Civil
things, yet not in all reſpects; and that in
their conforming to things lawful and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
yet there muſt even in that conformity
be ſomething wherein they muſt be unlike
the world. We may do ſome things that
the world doth, but we may not do them
in all reſpects as the world doth them. Our
Saviour telleth us, <hi>(Luke</hi> 20. 34.) <hi>The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of this world marry, and are given in
marriage;</hi> i. e. Thoſe that live in the world,
while they are in the world, have this way,
and manner, and faſhion, and cuſtom; <hi>they
marry, and are given in marriage:</hi> where
the things themſelves of <hi>marrying, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in marriage,</hi> are not condemned; but
this is condemned, Our being like the
world even in thoſe things that are in
themſelves lawful. And this appears by
another expreſſion of our Saviour, <hi>(Luke</hi>
17. 26, 28.) <hi>As it was in the days of Noah,
they eat, they drank, they married, and gave
in marriage,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And as it was in the days
of Lot, they bought, they ſold, they planted,
they builded, &amp;c.</hi> Now theſe were things
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59219:27"/>
that were never unlawful in themſelves. It
was never unlawful in any age, for a man
to eat, and drink, and marry, and give in
marriage. It was never unlawful for a man
to buy and ſell, to plant and build; and
yet this ſeems to have been the way of the
world then, which is by our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
But the meaning of our Saviour
is this, That though they were lawful
things, yet by the men of that Generation
they were uſed unlawfully. They made it
the main and whole buſineſs of their lives,
to eat and drink, to marry and give in
marriage, to buy and ſell, to plant and
build; they minded nothing elſe, as if
they were only made for thoſe ends, and
no other, no higher. But in this, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
muſt be unlike the World: they may
eat and drink, marry, buy, ſell, plant,
build; but ſtill remember, they were made
for higher and nobler Ends than theſe, and
not be in the uſe and practiſe of theſe
things, as the World is. The World's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in theſe things, is by Chriſtians to be
avoided. So then, to cloſe all, There is a
conformity to the Word in Civil things,
that is lawful for Chriſtians, but not a full
conformity. Thus much for the Civil
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59219:28"/>
Manners and Cuſtoms of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are the Sinful Manners,
Cuſtoms, and Faſhions of the World,
which are in themſelves purely ſinful. Now
to theſe it is unlawful for a Chriſtian to be
a <hi>Conformist</hi> in any reſpect. The Apoſtle
<hi>(Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2.) ſpeaks of thoſe that were then
Chriſtians, That <hi>in time paſt they walked
according to the courſe of this world;</hi> where
he means not the <hi>civil</hi> courſe, but the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
courſe of this world, as it appears ver.
3. <hi>Fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh, and the
deſires of the fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the mind.</hi> Where
the Apoſtle ſhews, that this was the courſe
of the World then, and that they confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to it in the time of their unregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which now they ought not to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called to be Chriſtians; and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
them, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> conformity in times
paſt, was their ſin. So then, a Chriſtian's
conforming to the ſinful courſes of the
world, is abſolutely unlawful. It's the
commendation given of the Saints of
old, That they were utterly <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi>
to the world in ſinful things. Thus
<hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid to be a man <hi>perfect in his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi>
Gen. 6. 9. He did ſome things
that the men of his generation did; <hi>Noah</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59219:28"/>
did eat, and drink, and marry, all this the
men of his generation did ſinfully, and in
this <hi>Noah</hi> did not conſorm to them. So we
may ſee how <hi>Lot</hi> behaved himſelf in his
generation; he was ſo far from conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their ſinful manners, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
tells us (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7.), <hi>That his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſoul was vexed with their wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi>
And the ſame Apoſtle tells the
Chriſtians in his time, of their <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
to the ſinful manners of thoſe
times, 1 Pet. 4. 4. <hi>Wherein they think it
ſtrange, that ye run not with them into the
ſame exceſs of Riot.</hi> They thought it
ſtrange, they would not do as the wicked
of thoſe times did. What was the courſe
of the Wicked of thoſe times? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſhews, <hi>v. 3. For the time past of our
lives may ſuffice us to have wrought the will
of the Gentiles;</hi> and ſo mentions <hi>laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
luſts, exceſs of Wine, revellings, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetings,</hi>
&amp;c. Theſe manners of the world
being ſinful without diſpute and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
they are not at all by Chriſtians to
be conformed to.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the ſinful Manners
and Faſhions of the VVorld.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59219:29"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There are the <hi>doubtful</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and Faſhions, and Cuſtoms, of the
VVorld; ſuch as about which there may
be a queſtion, Whether they are ſinful
or not? Concerning theſe, Chriſtians
ought to examine their conformity by
Scripture-Rules. Under this doubtful
conformity, comes conformity to Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Modes in Behaviour and Apparel; the
ſaying indeed is, <hi>That though fools bring up
Faſhions, yet wiſe men will be obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them:</hi> I am not for an affected ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
it being commendable prudence to
conform our ſelves to what Cuſtom (in an
indifferent matter) hath made to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
in the practiſe of all. But Chriſtians
are to take heed of a conformity to thoſe
faſhions that are either ſo immodeſt or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
that they become not Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
It's very doubtful whether we are to
be of the number of thoſe who are firſt in
the faſhion, or to change from one extream
to another; the Scripture (without doubt)
condemns exceſs in theſe things. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are there, which ſpend more time in
trimming and decking themſelves, than in
ſerving God! VVhich gave occaſion to
Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> to ſay to a Lady (whom
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59219:29"/>
he beheld induſtriouſly curious in dreſſing
and trimming her ſelf) <hi>O Madam, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
will God deal with you, if he give you not
Hell, ſince you take ſuch extraordinary pains
for it!</hi> Chriſtians muſt know, where there is
in faſhions an affected vanity in apparel &amp;
dreſſing, ſavouring of pride, a conformity
therein remains no more doubtful, but is
abſolutely ſinful. To theſe faſhions may
be referred, Painting, Frizling, Powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Black-patching; of the laſt of
which, a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> ſaith. <hi>That if the Divine
Work-man ſhould ſo ſix thoſe their beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
Patches, as to remain ever immova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they would ſoon be aſhamed to appear
with ſuch diſguiſed deformities; and all
would then eſteem them (as indeed they are)
but a meer disfiguring of what they ſo vainly
intended to beautifie and amend.</hi> In the
matter of Faſhions, Chriſtians muſt know,
that there are ſome things, which if they
are not ſin, are near a-kin to ſin; and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to theſe things is to be avoided,
according to the precept of the Apoſtle,
1 Theſ. 5. 22. <hi>Abſtain from all appearance
of evil;</hi> the ſaying is, <hi>In dubiis minimum,</hi>
In doubtful things its good to do the
leaſt. I ſhall cloſe up this of <hi>doubtful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59219:30"/>
with that paſſage in <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. 61, 62,
63. There were ſome that upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the Captivity, pleaded that they
were of the Prieſt's Line; but the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
being ſearched, and their Genealogy
not found, they were put by the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
till there ſhould ſtand up a Prieſt
with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> So it were well
in theſe doubtful caſes, if Chriſtians would
avoid conformity to theſe things, till there
be more Scripture-light to warrant it.
What hath been attempted by ſome (as
particularly, by the Author of that Book
entituled, <hi>Auxiliary Beauty),</hi> it tends more
to pleaſe Fancy, than to ſatisfie Conſcience,
and to warrant the practiſe.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Doubtful Manners
and Faſhions of this world.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>1. <hi>Information:</hi> So you have the true
Character of a true Chriſtian: He is one
that is a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> to the world. His
motion is a Counter-motion to that of the
world. Though he liveth in the world, yet
he conforms not to the world. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
(2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3.) diſtinguiſheth between
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59219:30"/>
living in the fleſh, and after the fleſh; ſo
there is a walking in the world, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after the world. True Chriſtians make
the ſinful courſes and practiſes of the
world, the object of their ſorrow and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
but not of their imitation. Thus
did <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and other holy ones in
their generation; they are <hi>Antipodes</hi> to
the world in judgment, affection, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
We read of Heathens, that in their
generations would not conform to the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of their generation; but what they
did, was out of ſingularity: but what
Chriſtians do, is to be out of ſincerity. It
ſhould be with Chriſtians as with the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
which have a motion of their own,
contrary to the wrapt motion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
whereby they are carried from Eaſt
to Weſt: they have a retrograde and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
motion of their own, whereby they
are carried from Weſt to Eaſt. So the
Children of God, though they live and
converſe in the World, yet have a motion
of their own, contrary to the World: As
ſome Creatures being hatched under a
Hen, preſently flye or run away. Though
a Chriſtian in the Civil things of this life,
ſeem to move as the World moves, yet hath
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59219:31"/>
he a motion of his own Heaven-wards,
which the World ſuſpects (and blindly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures),
but underſtands not.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Inform.</hi> What are we then to think
of thoſe that are <hi>Conformiſts</hi> to the world?
Is it to be thought that thoſe will ever be
accounted Chriſtians on Scripture-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that conform to the world? It's ſad
to ſee how many call themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who when the Image and Superſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that they bear, comes to be examined,
will be found to be only Worldlings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It
may be, Chriſtians in their own account
and eſteem, but not in God's. You that
call your ſelves Chriſtians, conſider whoſe
Image and Superſcription you bear. Such
you are as the Image is that you bear, and
the Pattern to which you conform. True
Chriſtians are ſuch as bear the Image of
Chriſt, and conform to the Pattern and
Example of Jeſus Chriſt; and thoſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be real Chriſtians that conform to the
World. It is not an outward Profeſſion
that makes a true Chriſtian, <hi>Rom. 2. 28. He
is not a Jew that is one outwardly.</hi> Thoſe
are not true Chriſtians that are only ſo in
bare pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſſion. God looks what a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's
conformity is, and what copy and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59219:31"/>
pattern he writes after. The Apoſtle ſpeaks
of ſome (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>that had a form of
godlineſs, but denied the power of it.</hi> It is
the power of Godlineſs and Chriſtianity,
that ſpeaks one to be godly, and a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
indeed. And this power of godlineſs is
a transforming power; it makes thoſe that
have it, God-like, and ſo godly; Chriſt-like,
and ſo Chriſtians indeed. So then, in
Chriſtianity there are two things to be
conſidered, the <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Power.</hi>
Now it is the power of Chriſtianity, and
not the profeſſion only, that ſpeaks us to be
Chriſtians. It's true power cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
profeſſion, but profeſſion may be
without the power. A Tree that bears
fruit, muſt of neceſſity have leaves; but a
Tree may have leaves; and yet no fruit.
And ſuch a Tree, not withſtanding the fair
flouriſh it makes, is but barren, and like
the Fig-tree in the Goſpel which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
curſed, coming to it, finding leaves
only, and no fruit, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 19. So then,
as there is a power in godlineſs which
ſpeaks men to be truly godly; ſo there is a
power in Chriſtianity which muſt ſpeak
men to be truly Chriſtians. Now, this
power of Chriſtianity doth conform and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59219:32"/>
transform us into the Image of Chriſt. As
the power of godlineſs makes us (as I ſaid
before) God-like; ſo this power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
Chriſt like. But where is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the world, there is a power,
whereby men are made world-like; and
how can thoſe that are like the world, that
bear a worldly and an earthly Image, and
not the heavenly, and that of Chriſt, be
Chriſtians indeed? It is ſad to ſee ſo many
call themſelves Chriſtians, that are ſo much
conformable to the world, to its ſinful
courſes, faſhions, rules, and examples; as if
Chriſtianity did not hold forth higher and
more excellent examples and patterns for
them to imitate, and higher and more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
rules for them to walk by. To ſuch
we may ſay as the Prophet ſaid to the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
of <hi>Ahaziah, Is it becauſe there is no
God in Iſrael, that thou ſendeſt to Baal-ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub,
the God of Ekron?</hi> So you that call
your ſelves Chriſtians, let me ask you, Why
do you conform to the World and its ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
courſes? Is it becauſe you are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to do? You ſee the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the contrary. Is it becauſe you have
nothing higher and better than the World
to conform to? Sure you have. The ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59219:32"/>
is, <hi>The firſt and beſt in every thing, is the
Rule of the reſt.</hi> Are you not called to a
conformity to the beſt? That God that is
<hi>Optimus Maximus,</hi> the Beſt and Greateſt,
calls you to be like him, calls you to be
like his Son, who is the moſt perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
for our imitation; calls you to be like
his Saints, who in their ſeveral generations
pleaſed God, ſerved his Will, and are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
aſleep: he calls you to be like thoſe
Servants of his that are yet in the World,
and to be followers of them as they are of
Chriſt: He calls you out of the World,
and to be unlike it, and to have nothing
to do with it by way of conforming in the
leaſt to its ſinful courſes. He cautionates
you againſt ſuch a conformity, and tells
you the dreadful danger of it; and he
hath laid down Rules in his Word, by
which Chriſtians are to walk, that are
made up altogether of that purity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
of which the World is altogether
void, it lying (as the Apoſtle ſaith) in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.
And now tell me, How can he be a
Chriſtian indeed, that is a <hi>Conformiſt</hi> to the
World? and ſuch as are <hi>Conformiſts</hi> to the
World (you ſee) have nothing to plead in
that particular, as if they had not better
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59219:33"/>
Rules to walk by, and higher Patterns to
imitate, than thoſe of the World. He that
is a Chriſtian indeed, is one that hath given
up his Name to Chriſt, and entred it into
his Liſt; and how can ſuch a one ſerve and
fight under the Colours and Banner of the
World? Such forget their <hi>Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
one clauſe of which is this, <hi>Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and forſaking of the world.</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
let me tell you, There is a day a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when the great enquiry will be, Whoſe
Image and Superſcription you bear. Your
<hi>Conformity</hi> or <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the world,
will ſpeak that, and accordingly will be
your doom.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Inform.</hi> Here we may ſee what is the
cauſe, why <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (that will be <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
indeed) meet with ſo much trouble and
oppoſition in and from the World; the
cauſe is, <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the World; the
ground of the quarrel between the World
and them is, That they are unlike the
World; that they will not do as the moſt
do; that they will not do as their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
do; that they are unlike every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
that they are a company of fooliſh
preciſe perſons, that delight to be ſingular.
This is the reaſon why the World, and the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59219:33"/>
men of it, hate thoſe that are truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Every thing loves its like; and the
unlikeneſs of the Saints to the World, is
the cauſe both of the World's hatred, and
the World's wonder at them, 1 Pet. 4. 4.
<hi>Wherein they think it ſtrange, that ye ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
not with them into the ſame exceſs of riot.</hi>
The Saint's ſtrictneſs is the VVorld's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
As I ſaid before, it is in this caſe as
with the Eggs of Patridges hatched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Hen; when they are hatched, they
run, and (as ſoon as they can) make away.
The VVorld is (as it were) the Hen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whoſe wings <hi>Christians</hi> are for a while
hatched; but when they begin to take
their flight upwards, then the world won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at them. And as this is the cauſe of
the VVorld's wonder, ſo it is the cauſe of
the VVorld's hatred of them, and of all
the afflictions and perſecutions they meet
with in and from the world. Our Saviour
told his Diſciples, <hi>In the world you ſhall
have affliction;</hi> and gives this as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it, <hi>I have choſen you out of the world.
The world</hi> (as our Saviour ſaith) <hi>will love its
own,</hi> thoſe in whom it can ſee its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
diſpoſitions; its own Image
and Superſcription. Likeneſs cauſeth love;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59219:34"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59219:34"/>

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59219:35"/>
and upon this account it is that the world
cannot but love thoſe in whom ſhe eſpies
her own likeneſſe, and cannot but hate
thoſe that are unlike, and in whom ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee a conformity to her. Hence it is
that the World hath always been a Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
to the Saints of God, uſing them
rigidly and coarſely, as thoſe whom ſhe did
not own as hers, becauſe they owned not
her by a conformity to her. <hi>Christians,</hi>
if you be not like the World, you muſt
not think it ſtrange if you be hated in and
by the World. If you have not the world's
<hi>likeneſs,</hi> you are not to expect the world's
<hi>love.</hi> If you walk contrary to the world,
you muſt expect that the world will walk
contrary to you. Your <hi>non-conforming</hi> to
it, is a ſecret condemning of the world's
ways and courles; and then it is not to be
wondred at, if the world condemn you.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the Uſe of <hi>Information.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> So I am now to exhort
you to the duty of <hi>Non-conformity</hi> to the
World; and in doing this, I ſhall acquaint
you with three things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> With what are ſome of the
cauſes of a <hi>Conformity</hi> to this World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59219:35"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> With ſome diſcoveries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may know whether we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to this World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> With ſome directions to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
yonr being <hi>Conformiſts</hi> to this
World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ſhall ſhew you ſome of the
cauſes why ſo many are <hi>Conformiſts</hi> to the
World; and they are chiefly two:
<list>
                     <item>1. A baſe and ſlaviſh fear of the World's
Frowns.</item>
                     <item>2. A baſe and ſinful love of the World's
Favours.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And from both theſe proceeds that baſe
and ſinful compliance with the World,
and conformity to it.</p>
               <p>1. A baſe and ſlaviſh fear of the
World's Frowns. They fear the trouble
they may meet with in the World, if they
ſhould ſwim againſt the ſtream of being
unlike the World. Moſt love a Religion
without trouble: and although oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be made the Attendant of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
following it as the ſhadow doth the
body; yet moſt love (as a cheap Religion
which may coſt them nothing, ſo) ſuch a
peaceable Religion as may not diſturb
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59219:36"/>
their worldly reſt, but that will ſuffer
them to ſleep in a whole skin. Indeed, for
a man to be no more religious than the
World would have him be, may ſeem to
make for his outward peace. As a wiſe
man ſaid, <hi>For that man that would deny
his body no ſenſual pleaſure, and yet ſave his
ſoul at laſt, there was no place like that of</hi>
Italy, <hi>and no Religion like that of</hi> Rome:
So I ſay, For that man that only ſtudies his
outward peace, <hi>(viz.</hi> a freedom from the
World's malice, hatred, and oppoſition)
there is no Religion like the World's. And
hence it is that ſo many comply with it,
and conform to it. Conſider, there is in
every one naturally a ſtrong propenſity
and inclination to theſe four things.</p>
               <p>1. To be thought ſome-body in the
World, and not to be looked upon as
Cyphers, as No-bodies; to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of, well ſpoken of by the moſt
of their generation. Some extreamly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the good-will and the good-word of
every one, and hereby are betrayed to a
ſinful compliance. Although ſuch ſhould
remember the ſaying of our Savior, <hi>Wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you when all men ſpeak well of you.</hi> Mat. 5.</p>
               <p>2. There is a deſire in moſt to be as free
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59219:36"/>
from trouble and oppoſition in the World,
as they can. Moſt ſay with <hi>Iſſachar, Reſt
is good.</hi> Why ſhould I (ſay ſome) create
trouble to my ſelf, and may chuſe? Why
ſhould I croſs with the World, and cauſe
the World to croſs with me? If I do as
the World doth, and conform to it, I need
not fear its frowns. And this is one cauſe
why ſo many ſinfully comply with, and
conform to the World; not remembring
the ſaying of our Saviour, Matt. 5. 10. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are thoſe that are perſecuted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
ſake,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. There is in men naturally a deſire to
have company in their way. Man is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
Creature, and loves company. Now
the way of the World is the way moſt
beaten, and trodden, and frequented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the way that moſt walk in. Men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
love not ſolitary paths, but thoſe
in which they can ſee moſt foot-ſteps. And
upon this account it is that ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
ſinfully with the World, for the ſake
of company; not at all conſidering whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the broad way leads; nor that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude
to do evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59219:37"/>
4. Men naturally deſire Elbow-room
in their way. They love ways wherein
they may enjoy the moſt of ſinful liberty;
and this they fancy to be only found in the
way of the World; they would have
room for them and their luſts to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
and ſuch a way the way of the
World is; the wide way (as our Saviour
ſaith) that leads to deſtruction. And hence
it is that ſo many comply with the World;
not conſidering, That it's eaſier for a man
to have ſo much Religion and Chriſtianity
as will pleaſe the World, and go to Hell at
laſt, than to have ſo much as will pleaſe
God, and bring him to Heaven.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond cauſe is, A ſtrong love
to, and deſire after the World's Favours.
There is an innate diſpoſition in perſons to
enjoy the World's Sun-ſhine, thinking
there is a refreſhment in thoſe beams. They
think it ſweet to ſit in the World's lap, to
be hugg'd in the World's boſome, to be
embrac'd in the VVorld's arms. Many love
not to ſee others embraced, and themſelves
caſt out; to ſee others favoured, and
themſelves frowned on; to ſee others the
world's Darlings, and they to be the
world's Out-caſts. The world hath its
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59219:37"/>
temptations on both hands. On the one
hand there are its perſecutions, and threats,
and frowns; on the other hand, its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
allurements, and favours; and
the laſt of theſe have often proved the
moſt powerful temptations to draw men
to compliance with the world. Thus it's
obſerved of <hi>Julian,</hi> That he drew more
away, and made more Apoſtates by his
Preferments, than he did by his Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
VVe read <hi>(Rev.</hi> 12. 4.), that the
Dragon with his tail drew the third part
of the Starrs from Heaven: the meaning
is, that many that were eminent in the
Church, and did ſhine as Starrs, were
drawn away, and became Apoſtates, by
the tail of the Dragon, <hi>i. e.</hi> by its embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And this is one great reaſon why men
have been brought to comply with, and
conform to the world. And this hath ever
been the world's way of tempting; it firſt
frowns, and then flatters; and the latter
hath been found to be the moſt dangerous:
Thus was that famous <hi>Galeacius</hi> aſſaulred;
and when they ſaw threatnings would do
nothing, he was offered a great ſum of
Gold to return again to his former Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Countrey: but his anſwer was,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59219:38"/>
                  <hi>That he preferr'd one day's communion with
Chriſt in the Goſpel, before all the Gold in the
world.</hi> And thus it was with <hi>Luther;</hi> when
they ſaw Bulls and nothing elſe by way of
Menace, would do, then they offered him
a Cardinals Hat; but his anſwer was, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptus
eſt à me Romanus &amp; favor, &amp; fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;</hi>
I deſpiſe both <hi>Rome</hi>'s Favours and
Fury. Though theſe ſtood as unſhaken
Mountains; yet, how many, if not by the
firſt, yet by the laſt have been overcome;
like the Traveller, who by the wind kept
his Cloak cloſer, was by the warm and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring
beams of the Sun invited to caſt it
off. The Sun-ſhine of the world hath had
more influence upon men to conform them
to the world, than all its cold and ſtormy
blaſts could have. It's Favours and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
hath drawn thoſe whom its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
could not drive. Hence it is that
ſo many comply with, and conform to the
world; not remembring, that there is
more comfort and happineſs attends thoſe
that are the world's Caſt-aways, than thoſe
that are the world's Darlings. Thoſe
Chriſt chuſeth to be the objects of his
love, whom the world caſts out as objects
of her hatred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59219:38"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider the trials and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
VVhether we are <hi>Conformiſts</hi>
or <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> to this world.</p>
               <p>1. He that is a <hi>Non-conformiſt</hi> to the
world, is one unlike the world; he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the world in his judgment, affection,
converſation; he doth not judg as the
world judgeth, of Chriſt, of Holineſs, of
Heaven, of Saints, of Sin. Here is the
queſtion, VVhether we differ from the
world in theſe? One ſaid of <hi>Nero, That
muſt needs be good that</hi> Nero <hi>perſecutes.</hi>
And ſo I ſay, That muſt needs be evil that
the world commends, and good that the
world condemns. Try your ſelves by this,
Do you judg as the world judgeth? Do
you love and hate, as the world loves and
hates? Is your converſation according to
the courſe and converſation of the world?
Then you may conclude, you are <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi>
to the world. Oh that Chriſtians
would but examine themſelves ſeriouſly,
wherein they are unlike the world; and
by that they may find whether they are
<hi>Non-conformists</hi> to the world. I am brief
in this, becauſe I have ſpoken more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to it before:</p>
               <p>2. He that is a <hi>Non-conformist</hi> to this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59219:39"/>
world, is a <hi>Conformist</hi> to another world.
VVhen the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Be not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this world;</hi> it implies, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world to which we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
Scripture mentions a world that
now is, and a world that is to come. There
is another world beſides this preſent
world; a world that will be, when this
world ſhall be no more. As I ſaid before,
ſo I ſay again, It is but a little while, and
the world preſent will be the world paſt;
and the world to come, will be the world
preſent all the days of Eternity. Now
Chriſtians, you are to be <hi>Conformists</hi> to
the world that is to come; there is an
Earthly and a Heavenly world; and the
great thing you have to do, is to examine
what Conformity there is in you to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(to the Heavenly world) that is to
come. And what of Heaven is to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeen
in you? VVhat of Heaven in your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
Do you conform to the world to
come in that? Chriſtians, you ſee here how
the world judgeth of things and perſons:
but, Do you think we ſhall have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that judgment of things that the men
of the world have now? If you ask, How
we ſhall judg of things here, who are yet
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59219:39"/>
on Earth, and not in Heaven? Why th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <hi>Word,</hi> and not the <hi>World,</hi> is your Rule; you
need not ſay, Who ſhall go up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to bring us tidings what is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of things there; we have it near, in
the written Word. Next, What confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
is there to Heaven in your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Are they heavenly? Remember,
the Command is <hi>(Col.</hi> 3. 2.), <hi>Set your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on things above.</hi> And, What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
is there in your converſation? Is
your converſation in Heaven? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith, the converſation of a Chriſtian
ſhould be ſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 27. What engravings
of Heaven are there on your converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
What beginnings of Heaven have
you in you? How many are there that
begin Hell on Earth, and have the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravings
of Hell written upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations?
Theſe indeed are <hi>Conformiſts</hi>
to another World, but it is that World
of Darkneſs, and not of Light, that is to
come.</p>
               <p>But in proſecuting theſe Diſcoveries of
a <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to this World, for every
one's better and fuller ſatisfaction, I ſhall
proceed by way of Enquirie; thoſe ſhall
be of two ſorts:
<list>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59219:40"/>
                     <item>1. Some more general.</item>
                     <item>2. More particular.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. More general: And ſo the Enquiry
is this, What conformity is there in you
to thoſe that are in Heaven, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
Heaven? If you ask, Who are in
Heaven? The Scripture tells you, That
there is
<list>
                     <item>A God.</item>
                     <item>A Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>Angels.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. God is in Heaven, his Throne is
there. He dwells there in reſpect of the
manifeſtation of his glorie. He is ſaid to
<hi>inhabit Eternity, and to dwell in that high
and holy place,</hi> Iſa. 57. 15. The enquiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this, God is in Heaven; and, What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
is there in you on Earth, to that
God who is in Heaven? You are called
to be like him, to be holy as he is, to be
merciful as he is (not in reſpect of equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but ſimilitude and likeneſs). You are
called to be partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and, What is that but to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59219:40"/>
of Divine Graces, by which we bear
his Image, and ſo become like him? You
are called Children of God, and Children
are to reſemble the Father: Now try, how
you reſemble him, and by that, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
to him.</p>
               <p>1. Conſider how God judgeth of things.
Here the Scripture gives us light; and by
it you are to ſee whether you judg of
things as God doth. He judgeth of Sin as
the greateſt Evil, of Sinners as the greateſt
Enemies; of Grace, as moſt excellent; of
gracious ones, as moſt precious; of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as moſt deſirable; of the World, as
moſt vain and contemptible. Thus God
in his Word declares his judgement of theſe
things. Now the Query is, What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
there is in our judgments to this?
Whether we judg of things as God judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of them? And ſo for the eſtimative
facultie, Whether you eſteem things
as God eſteemeth them? The godly man
is deſcribed <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 15.) to be one <hi>in whoſe
eyes a vile perſon is contemned; but he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth
them that fear the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. How God-like you are in your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?
and, What conformitie is there in
yours to his? The Scripture acquaints us
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59219:41"/>
with what God loves, and with what he
hates, and with what he delights in. The
Scripture tells us what he loves; That he
loves righteouſneſs, loves holineſs; he
loves uprightneſs, he loves truth and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the inward parts. Now put the
queſtion to your ſelves, Whether you love
the things which God loves? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
tells us what God hateth, He hateth
iniquitie, and all the workers of iniquitie;
he hateth ſin, and all ſinful ways; he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
all ſin. And now ſee what conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
there is in your affections, of hatred to
this? The Scripture acquaints us, what it
is that God delights in. It tells us, that he
delighteth in thoſe that fear him; He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
in uprightneſs. He is a God that
hath pleaſure in uprightneſs. He delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in mercy. Now Chriſtians, try what
conformitie there is in you to your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father in theſe things.</p>
               <p>2. Chriſt is in Heaven, <hi>Phil. 3. 20. from
whence we look for a Saviour,</hi> &amp;c. We look
for him from Heaven: And it is an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of our Faith, <hi>That he is aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven:</hi> Though Chriſt be in Heaven,
and you on Earth, yet there is to be in
Chriſtians a conformitie to Jeſus Chriſt.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59219:41"/>
Chriſt is the Head; now he is in Heaven,
and the members muſt be conformed to
the Head. Though he be in Heaven, yet
he hath left us ſuch foot-ſteps on Earth,
in which we are to tread. Thoſe that will
come to Chriſt in Heaven, muſt tread in
his ſteps on Earth, and ſo aſcend up to
him. Chriſtians are ſtill to be followers of
Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt is the great Maſter
they are to follow, and the grand Pattern
they are to imitate. The great Apoſtle
ſaid, <hi>Be followers of me, as I am of Chriſt.</hi>
Now, Chriſtians, trie what conformitie
there is in you to Jeſus Chriſt; and you
have reaſon to put your ſelves upon the
trial, becauſe the Apoſtle telleth us <hi>(Rom.</hi>
8. 28.) <hi>We are predeſtinated to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to his Image.</hi> Let me tell you, there
are three things wherein Chriſtians are
called to be conformable to Jeſus Chriſt,
viz. <hi>Sufferings, Sanctity, Glory.</hi> In this
world we are called to be conformed to
Jeſus Chriſt in the two firſt: when we come
to Heaven, we ſhall be made conformable
to him in the latter. Now the Querie lieth
about the two firſt.</p>
               <p>1. Chriſtians, What conformitie is
there in you to Jeſus Chriſt in your <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59219:42"/>
It cannot be that a Chriſtian can be
a Chriſtian indeed, but he muſt be a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſtian: if it come not ſo high as to
reſiſting unto blood, yet it may come to
bonds and impriſonments; if not ſo high,
yet to ſcoffs, nick-names, reproaches, for
the ſake of Chriſt. Now, Chriſtians, In
your <hi>ſufferings</hi> are you conformed to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt? Do you ſuffer meekly, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
rejoicingly? Chriſt was patient in
his ſufferings: <hi>He was led as a ſheep to the
ſlaughter, and he opened not his mouth.</hi> He
prayed for his perſecutors: <hi>When he was
reviled, he reviled not again;</hi> and in that,
the Apoſtle <hi>Petor</hi> telleth us, <hi>He left us an
example, that we ſhould tread in his ſteps,</hi>
1 Pet. 2. 23. Now trie your ſelves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you are like Chriſt, or the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>ſufferings.</hi> It is the way of the world,
to return like for like, railing for railing,
reviling for reviling; to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>et, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
and be impatient under their <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
Chriſtians, Jeſus Chriſt when he
was on earth, and in the days of his <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
was otherwiſe. Now ſee to whom you
conform in your <hi>ſufferings,</hi> whether to
Chriſt or the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59219:42"/>
2. VVhat conformitie is there is you
to Jeſus Chriſt, in reſpect of <hi>Sanctity</hi> and
<hi>Holineſs?</hi> Though Jeſus Chriſt be now in
Heaven, yet he hath left us his foot-ſteps
of that wherein we are to tread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was
one that went about, doing good. He was
abundant in dutie, and much in prayer.
He was ſo holy in the whole courſe of his
life, that he challenged any to convince
him of ſin. He ſuffered wrong, but did no
wrong, <hi>neither was guile found in his
mouth.</hi> He was conformable to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
will, and it was his meat and drink
to do it. He was much in ſelf-denial; he
denied himſelf in his deareſt things; he
laid aſide his own glory: he laid down
his own life for the ſalvation of poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
He was much in holy and heavenly
diſcourſe, ever ſpeaking of the Kingdom
of heaven; and taking occaſion from
earthly things, to reflect on and diſcourſe
of heavenly things. He was much in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing,
counſelling, comforting his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
He ſtood up for the honour of his
Father, and defended the truth againſt all
oppoſition. All this, and much more, did
he in the days of his fleſh, when he was on
earth, and therein left us an example. He
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59219:43"/>
made a holy cloſe of his life; As he lived,
ſo he died. VVhen the time of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
death drew near, he betook himſelf to
prayer. Under his laſt ſufferings he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himſelf meekly and patiently. VVhen
nailed to the Croſs, he prayed for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
ſaying, <hi>Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do</hi> VVhen he was
giving up the Ghoſt, he commended his
Soul to God, ſaying, <hi>Father, into thy hands
I commit my ſpirit.</hi> Thus, Chriſtians, you
ſee a ſhort <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Sanctity</hi>
when he was on Earth. Now trie your
conformitie to Jeſus Chriſt, who is now in
Heaven? Can you ſay, <hi>My Pattern is in
Heaven,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of his <hi>Witneſs,</hi> Job 16.
19 <hi>My Witneſs is in Heaven?</hi> Do you tread
in thoſe ſteps of holineſs that Jeſus Chriſt
hath left? which though we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
walk in; yet, Do you ſtrive to come
as near in imitating his Example, as you
can? Remember, Chriſtians, The world
hath found out other ways than the way
of Jeſus Chriſt: There is the way of <hi>Cain,</hi>
and <hi>Corah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi>
in which the moſt of the world walk.
But the way wherein you are to walk, is
that way wherein Jeſus Chriſt walked
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59219:43"/>
when he was on earth. Chriſtians are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to be in this World, as Jeſus Chriſt was
in this World.</p>
               <p>3. In Heaven are <hi>Angels.</hi> Angels of
Light; who are called <hi>holy Angels,</hi> and are
the Heavenly Courtiers. Theſe are ſome
of the Inhabitants of the World that is
to come. Chriſtians, You are to try what
conformitie there is in you to theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlie
Spirits, and whether you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to Angels of Light, or Angels of
Darkneſs. Thoſe who are <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi>
to this world, hold ſome conformitie to
thoſe glorious Angels that inhabit the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world; and the great and main con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
to them, ſtands in our doing the
will of God on Earth, as the Angels do it
in Heaven; it is one Petition in the Lord's
Prayer, <hi>Thy will be done on earth as it is in
Heaven.</hi> Now try your ſelves by this.</p>
               <p>1. They do the will of God Zealouſly,
with a great deal of heat, fervency, and
intention of ſpirit, and are therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Seraphims.</hi> They are zealous for his
work, and zealous in his work. Are you
conformable to them in that?</p>
               <p>2. Angels do the will of God Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with abundance of delight and joy;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59219:44"/>
and therefore they are ſaid to have Harps,
to ſhew it is their Muſick and Delight. All
the Services God puts them upon, they go
about with abundance of alacritie. Now
what conformitie is there in you to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in this? When you go to dutie, Do
you go about it as Angels do about their
work? Remember, the moſt of the world
are never more ſad and dull, than when
they are ſet about Heavenlie work; and
never ſo chearful, as when they are out of
God's work, and freed, from Heavenlie
employments.</p>
               <p>3. Angels in Heaven do the will of God
ſpeedilie, and are therefore ſaid to have
wings. They never diſpute the commands
of God; no ſooner are they bid go, but
they go. What Meſſages they are ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
what Work they are put upon, they
do and execute readily and ſpeedily. Now
Chriſtians, How like Angels are you in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord's work on earth? The way
of the world is to move ſlowly, as <hi>Pharo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s
Chariots when the Wheels were pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
off. But, Chriſtians, if you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Angels, there is a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of mind in you to do the will of God;
You ſtand ready preſſed for his Service,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59219:44"/>
and have your Loins girded up.</p>
               <p>4. Angels do the will and work of God
with much ſelf-denial: They aſcribe all
to God, and give him all the glorie; and
therefore are ſaid to <hi>caſt down their Crowns
before the Throne:</hi> and in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1. 8. they
are ſaid to have hands under their wings,
as concealing their own abilities. Now,
Chriſtians, ſee what conformitie there is
in you to the Angels, in this particular of
<hi>Self-denial.</hi> It's the way of moſt of the
world, when they do any thing that is
good, to boaſt and be proud of it; as the
<hi>Phariſee,</hi> of his faſting and duties. But
thoſe that are conformable (in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular)
to the Angels in Heaven, do nothing
as of themſelves, and give all the glory to
God; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, who ſaid, <hi>By the grace
of God I am what I am; and not I, but the
grace of God which is in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do the will and the work of
God with abundance of love. There is a
ſweet harmony and agreement among
them in their Employments; they do not
croſs or thwart one another, they are obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
Servants to their Lord, and are in
love and unitie among themſelves. <hi>Ezek.</hi>
1. 9. we read of the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59219:45"/>
living Creatures, that their wings joined
one to another, and they turned not when
they went, and they went every one
ſtraight forward; they did not go one this
way, and another that way, but do ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and mutually correſpond in doing the
will of God. Now, Chriſtians, What
conformitie is there in you to Angels in
this? Do you ſweetly conſpire and agree
together in ſerving God on Earth? Oh
that Chriſtians were more Angel-like in
this! Remember, Contention and Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the way of the world, and the way
of carnal men; the Apoſtle tells us ſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
3. 3. <hi>While there are ſtrifes and diviſions
among you, are you not carnal, and walk as
men.</hi> Now, Chriſtians, I have ſhew'd you
how the Angels in another world do the
will of God; and try your ſelves what
conformitie there is in you on earth, to
them.</p>
               <p>4. In Heaven are the Spirits and Souls
of juſt men made perfect. Theſe are in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
world, they are in Heaven; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the Promiſes: and ſuch the Apoſtle
commands us to be followers of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12.
Now what conformitie is there in you to
them?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:59219:45"/>
1. We have reaſon to believe there is
in them a longing for a full accompliſhment
of the number of the Elect, and for a full
revelation of glory. They long for their
own perfection, and that of all the Saints.
This the world longs not for, the coming
of the Kingdom of Glory. Our Saviour
tells us how it was in the days of <hi>Noah, they
eat, they drank,</hi> &amp;c. and ſaith, it would be
ſo in the days of his Coming. Now ſee
what your conformitie is in this particular:
Do you mind the Glory to come? Is there
in you a looking for the coming of Jeſus
Chriſt?</p>
               <p>2. The Spirits in Heaven are in perfect
union. What ever diſagreements were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Saints on Earth, yet in Heaven
they all agree: There <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther,
Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper,</hi> are agreed. Now ſee
what conformitie there is in you to them?
Is it your endeavour to preſerve on Earth
<hi>the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Spirits of juſt men departed, are
with Chriſt, enjoying his preſence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing
in it. Tell me, Do you rejoice in
the thoughts of it? and do you long for it,
and to be with Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Thus for the general Queries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59219:46"/>
2. Conſider ſome particular Queries;
and they are to enquire further what <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi>
you are to another world?</p>
               <p>1. Do you ſpeak the language of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world? We read of ſpeaking the <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Canaan:</hi> We know of what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
a man is, by the language that he
ſpeaks. Is your language heavenly? The
Primitive Chriſtians were charged with
being affectors of Kingdoms, becauſe they
ſpake ſo often of the Kingdom of God.
What ſhall we think of thoſe whoſe words
are either worldly or wicked? To what
world are they conformed?</p>
               <p>2. What life do you live? Is it the life
of another world? Is your Converſation
in Heaven? And have you the engravings
of Heaven on them? It is ſad to ſee that
moſt of the world have the engravings of
Hell upon their's.</p>
               <p>3. VVhat works do you? Do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to another world, or only to this?
Praying, hearing, holy meditation, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
God, and religious duties, they relate
to another world, to an heavenly world
that is to come. How ſad is is to ſee how
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59219:46"/>
many there are whoſe works only relate to
this world, or to the infernal vvorld of
Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>4. VVhat things do you moſt eye and
look at? Are they the things of another
world, or of this vvorld? The Apoſtle
ſaith (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. the laſt), <hi>We look not upon the
things that are ſeen,</hi> &amp;c. Do you moſt eye
and long after heavenly Glory, Treaſures,
and Poſſeſſions, or Earthly?</p>
               <p>5. VVhat vvorld is it you make the
greateſt preparation and proviſion for? Do
you provide for that vvorld that novv is,
or for that that is to come? VVe read of
the fool in the Goſpel, that cheer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
vvith that, <hi>That he had goods laid up
for many years.</hi> Hovv many are there, that
have no thoughts of another vvorld? That
provide for their peace, and ſafety, and
contentment in this vvorld; that ſay, <hi>What
ſhall we do to be rich?</hi> but never ask, <hi>What
they ſhall do to be ſaved?</hi> that <hi>lay up for
themſelves treaſures on earth,</hi> but <hi>lay not up
treaſures in heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. VVhat place, and vvhat vvorld do
you look upon as your home? Is it this
vvorld, or that to come? If that to come,
then you are in this, as ſtrangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59219:47"/>
you lodg in it as in an Inn; and you
walk through it as perſons unconcerned in
its ſinful luſts and vanities.</p>
               <p>7. What Right and Intereſt do you moſt
rejoice in? Is it, that you have an Intereſt
in this world? or, that you have an Intereſt
in the world to come? Is it in that portion
you enjoy here, or in that portion that
God hath reſerved for his in another
world? Is it in your Manſions here, or in
thoſe that Chriſt hath provided in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Kingdom for his?</p>
               <p>8. VVhence do you fetch all your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in any ſad and cloudy condition? Is it
from this world, or from the thoughts of
another world, where there ſhall be no
more ſorrow, nor weeping, nor death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. VVhat promiſes do you moſt priſe?
VVhether thoſe that are made concerning
this world, or thoſe that concern the world
that is to come? The Apoſtle telleth us,
<hi>That godlineſs hath the promiſes of both</hi> But
he that is a <hi>Nonconformist</hi> to this world,
doth moſt highly priſe the latter, and
would not be without them for a world,
to enjoy the former.</p>
               <p>10. How do you do the Civil buſineſſes
of this world? Do you do them as relating
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59219:47"/>
to another world? Do you ſo eat, and
drink, and marry, and uſe the World, as
thoſe that think of Eternity, and as thoſe
that ſhortly look for Eternity? Do you
ſo uſe this World, as thoſe that muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leave it, and muſt go hence, to live in
another World? It's ſad to ſee how many
there are, that live in this world as if there
were no life to come, nor any other World
to be looked for. Now, Chriſtians, if you
are <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to this World, you uſe
it with weaned affections, as thoſe whoſe
time is ſhort, and are paſſing out of this
life into another.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the Evidences, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to this
World.</p>
               <p>3. Directions what to do; with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
propounded, that we may not
be <hi>Conformiſts</hi> to this World: With
Means and Helps preſcribed, How we may
be delivered from ſuch a <hi>Conformity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Thoſe that would be <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi>
to this World, muſt be much in comparing
both Worlds together, this World, with
that which is to come. They muſt take a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59219:48"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59219:48"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:59219:49"/>
view of both Worlds, and by that means
they will come to diſcern which of the two
is moſt worthy of their conformity, to
which it's moſt rational to conform. When
we have compared them together, as we
ſhall find this World not worthy to be
compared with the World to come; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worthy to be conformed to.</p>
               <p>So, conſider what a World that is, that
is to come; and then ſee how worthy that
World is of a Chriſtian's conformity. The
Scripture gives us ſome account of the
World to come, what a World it is; and
by that light we ſhall walk, in making a
deſcription of it.</p>
               <p>1. The World to come, is an <hi>Eternal
World.</hi> This World is but <hi>temporary;</hi> this
is but <hi>this preſent</hi> world, this <hi>now</hi> world,
which ſhortly will not be. As <hi>David</hi> ſaith
of the wicked of the world <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 37.),
<hi>Yet a little while, and the wicked ſhall not
be; thou ſhalt ſeek his place:</hi> So we may
ſay of this World, <hi>Yet a little while, and it
will be no more, and its place will not be
found:</hi> The great Creator ſet up this
Earthly World to be as a Stage, wherein
men (in their ſucceſſive generations) are
to act their parts for ſome thouſands of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59219:49"/>
years, and then God will take it down. It
is reſerved for fire; it is drawing to its end,
as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>The end of all
things is at hand.</hi> The World to come, is
an enduring-world, which will to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
continue, when this World will be no
more. Chriſtians, remember, you are made
for Eternity; and if upon this account
you compare both World's together, you
cannot but conclude, its the Eternal world
you are to be <hi>Conformiſts</hi> to.</p>
               <p>2. The World to come is an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
World;</hi> its firm and fixed; a Kingdom
that cannot be ſhaken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. But this
World is a changeable World, and all the
things of this World are changeable
things. All the men in the World are
changeable Creatures; they are all children
of Change: Here one Generation goeth,
and another cometh. There is no fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſetledneſs, ſtability here: Like the
Moon, this World hath her changes. But
the World to come, is the World that is
unchangeable. As with the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
there is no variableneſs; ſo it is with
Heaven it ſelf. Now compare the two
Worlds upon this account, and ſee which
is moſt worthy of your Conformity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:59219:50"/>
3. The World to come is a <hi>Glorious
World.</hi> It is the place where Glory dwells.
Heaven is the Houſe of Glory; its called
<hi>the Kingdom of Glory;</hi> all that inhabit it,
are glorious. There is the place where the
glorious God (who inhabiteth Eternity)
doth and will to all Eternity make the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations
of his Glory. When we look
upon the viſible Heavens (which are but
the outſide of that Houſe), and ſee them
ſo glorious, How glorious then are the
Manſions within? As for this World, it is
the place where Miſery and Baſeneſs
dwells. Now if you compare the two
worlds upon this account, then judg which
world is moſt worthy of your confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p>4. The Heavenly World is a <hi>Holy World,</hi>
where no ſin dwells. It's called <hi>the Holy
Heavens,</hi> Pſal. 20. 5. There dwells righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
2 Pet. 3. 13. <hi>We look for new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and new Earth, wherein dwells righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>
No unclean thing ſhall or can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there. The Apoſtate Angels, for their
ſin and diſobedience, were caſt out thence,
and ſhall know their place there no more
to all eternity. The <hi>Heavenly Jeruſalem</hi> is
deſcribed to be a City paved with Gold;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59219:50"/>
to ſhew, among other things, its purity.
Now this world is an unholy world. <hi>Gal.</hi>
1. 4. it's there called, <hi>this preſent evil
world.</hi> It's an evil world, both in reſpect
of Miſery, and in reſpect of Sin. But in
that world which is to come, as there will
be no <hi>ſuffering,</hi> ſo no <hi>ſinning.</hi> The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of that world will to all Eternity be
above both. Now if you compare the
two worlds upon this account, then judg
which world is to be conformed to.</p>
               <p>5. The world to come is a <hi>Quiet</hi> and
<hi>Peaceable World.</hi> It's the world of reſt,
where there are no ſtirrs, no troubles, no
diſturbances, no diſquietments. It's the
place where reſt only is to be found. All
Chriſtians, while they are in this world,
muſt ſay, <hi>Here is not our reſt. Rev.</hi> 15. 2.
the world is reſembled to a <hi>Sea of Glaſs
mingled with fire:</hi> A <hi>Sea of Glaſs,</hi> to ſhew
its brittleneſs and ſlipperineſs; and <hi>ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with fire,</hi> (i.e.) with the fire of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
troubles, perſecutions. This world
indeed is a Chriſtian's Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now compare
the two worlds together upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and ſee which is worthy of your
conformity.</p>
               <p>6. The world to come, is the world for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59219:51"/>
                  <hi>which man was chiefly made.</hi> Chriſtians, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
you are made for another world.
This world is to be but only as an Inn, in
which you are to lodg as ſtrangers and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
in your way and paſſage to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world. Chriſtians muſt ſay of it, <hi>That
here they have no abiding City, but ſeek one
that is to come;</hi> and that is, the world to
come. Man is a Creature made capable of
Immortality; he hath an immortal Soul;
and this ſhews he was made for another
world. The Apoſtle tells us (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19),
<hi>If in this life only we had hope in Chriſt, we
were of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> Chriſtians, if
you had been made only for this life, and
had your hopes only in this world, and did
not expect and hope for the great things of
another life, and world that is to come;
you were of all men moſt miſerable. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
you were made for this End, <hi>To
glorifie God, and to enjoy him to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
And this ſhews, that then you muſt be
made for another world. VVhere can you
ſerve him for ever, and enjoy him for ever,
but in another world? To ſing praiſes and
Hallelujahs to God, will be the work of
Saints in the Heavenly world. There they
ſhall praiſe God to all Eternity, and ſhew
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59219:51"/>
what eternal debtors they are to Mercy
and Free-grace. And then for the other
chief End of man, which is, <hi>The enjoyment
of God for ever;</hi> where can that be but in
another world? The eternal fruition of
God, and Chriſt, muſt be in a world that is
Eternal, which is that world that is to
come. Now, Chriſtians, conſider, what you
do here in relation to ſerving of God, is
but the beginning of that work we have
to do in Heaven; and what you enjoy of
God here, is but only a taſte of that we
ſhall enjoy of him in another world. Now
upon this account conſider, Chriſtians,
what world is worthy of your confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p>7. The world to come, is <hi>the world
drawing near to us;</hi> and the world preſent,
is <hi>the world going from us.</hi> Chriſt, when he
began to preach, ſaid, <hi>The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is at hand:</hi> where, by the Kingdom of
Heaven, is meant the Heavenly Coſpel,
which open'd and made way to that world
that is to come. So, let me tell you, The
world to come, is at hand; the world to
come, is the world to be; this preſent
world, ere long, will not be. It is near
parting with us, and vve ſhould be ſo vvith
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59219:52"/>
it. Eternity is at hand, and vve live upon
the borders of it. This vvorld hath not
long to be, nor vve long to be in it: vvhen
ye go out of it, ye enter upon Eternity;
you go to an Eternal VVorld, vvhere you
muſt have an Eternal Being. Now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
theſe tvvo vvorlds together upon all
theſe accounts, and judg rationally which
is moſt vvorthy of your conformity.</p>
               <p>Thus for the firſt <hi>Direction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Direction.</hi> That you may be <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi>
to this vvorld, compare together
the conſequences of a <hi>Conformity</hi> and a
<hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the vvorld. Compare
together the conveniences and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
the advantages and diſadvantages,
the gain and the loſs, that you have by
conforming and not conforming to this
vvorld. So here are two things to be done:
<list>
                     <item>1. To conſider, VVhat you vvill
gain by being <hi>Conformiſts</hi> to the
vvorld.</item>
                     <item>2. What you will loſe by <hi>not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to the vvorld.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. Conſider, vvhat you vvilt gain by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59219:52"/>
conforming to the world. All you gain,
amounts but to this, <hi>The World's good-will,</hi>
and <hi>the World's good-word.</hi> If you-be a
<hi>Conformiſt</hi> to the world, you ſhall have
the love, and favour, and affection of the
world; you ſhall be hugg'd in her boſome,
you ſhall ſit in her lap, you ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
her Darlings, when others ſhall
be but her Out-caſts; you ſhall be high
in the world's eſteem; the men of the
world will ſpeak well of you living, and
(perhaps) well of you when you are dead!
They will ſpeak what a loſs they have,
what an honeſt man is gone. This is the
moſt (for ought I ſee) a man gains by a
conformity to this world, To have the
men of the world's good-will and good-word;
whereby a man enjoys ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace, and quietneſs, and freedom
from trouble; <hi>that</hi> (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
ſpeaks) <hi>he comes not in trouble like other
men.</hi> And, beſides all this, it may be he is
made partaker of ſome of the world's
Promotions and Preferments. This is the
ſum of vvhat a man gains by being a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt</hi>
to this world.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider, What a man loſeth by a
Conformity to this world. So conſider
what that loſs amounts to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:59219:53"/>
1. A loſs of inward peace. That man
can have no true peace in his own ſpirit,
that walks by a Rule that is deſtructive to
his own ſoul, Iſa. 57. 27. <hi>There is no peace,
ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> And if no
peace to the wicked, then what peace can
there be to thoſe that conform to this
world? Conformity to the world may
give a man ſome outward peace; but it can
never give a man that peace that is true
peace, which is peace within, which is the
peace of God and not of the world, <hi>a
peace paſſing underſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Such as conform to the world, loſe
the favour of God. He that makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Favourite of the world, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
one whom God looks upon as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy:
Jam. 4. 4. <hi>The friendſhip of the
world is enmity with God.</hi> He that is a
friend to the ſinful courſes, faſhions, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and ways of the world, is a profeſſed
enemy to God, and God profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
an enemy to him. How ſhall God
love and affect, favour and delight in that
man, who forſakes thoſe rules and ways
that he hath preſcribed him to walk in,
and to conform to thoſe patterns and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
which he hath propoſed to him to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59219:53"/>
imitate; to cloſe with thoſe ways, and to
follow thoſe examples which he hath flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbid us to walk in, and to conform to?
So that every <hi>Conformiſt</hi> to the world is
ſuch a perſon as loſeth the favour of
God.</p>
               <p>Now come and compare this gain and
loſs together.</p>
               <p>1. The gaining of outward, and the
loſs of inward peace; and tell me, What
ſhall it profit a man to gain worldly peace,
and loſe inward and ſpiritual peace? It's
peace in the ſoul and ſpirit, that is the true
peace. Chriſt told his, <hi>That in him they
ſhould have peace,</hi> when yet <hi>in the world
they ſhould have affliction.</hi> It is not peace
<hi>from</hi> trouble, but peace <hi>in</hi> trouble; peace
<hi>within,</hi> when there is trouble <hi>without,</hi> that
is true peace. A man's greateſt trouble, is
trouble within, when it is in his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
Prov. 18. 14. <hi>The ſpirit will ſuſtain his
infirmities; but a wounded ſpirit, who can
bear?</hi> There are the lending-parts, and
the borrowing-parts, in the body. If the
lending-parts, as the heart, and brain, &amp;c.
be wounded; the borrowing-parts, <hi>viz.</hi>
hand, or foot, cannot relieve them: but
if the borrowing-parts be wounded, the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59219:54"/>
lending-parts can relieve them. A quiet
and a peaceable Spirit and Conſcience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
againſt all outward troubles, and
helps a man to ſuſtain all his outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities:
But if there be trouble in the
ſpirit, outward peace and proſperity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
relieve that. Let the Winds be never
ſo high and bluſtring, yet they cannot
make an Earth-quake; but it's wind got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
into the inwards and bowels of the
earth, that cauſeth that. It is not trouble
<hi>without,</hi> that can trouble us, while there is
peace <hi>within;</hi> no more than Hail-ſtones
ratling on the Tiles of the Houſe, can hurt
us, while we are at a Feaſt in a dry and
warm Houſe. Alas! what is outward peace
without inward! Peace <hi>without,</hi> when
there is trouble <hi>within,</hi> can give no peace
to the ſpirit; it reacheth not the leading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
The Earth may as ſoon give light to
the Sun, and a Tempeſt give reſt to the Sea,
as outward and worldly peace can give
reſt to a wounded ſpirit. What comfort is
there in a man's being aſſured of freedom
from the World's perſecutions, and to be
under the apprehenſion of the purſuits of
Eternal Wrath? Now compare theſe two
together, the loſs of worldly and inward
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59219:54"/>
peace, and then conſider what you gain by
having peace <hi>without,</hi> and loſing peace
<hi>within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Compare together the gaining of the
world's favour, and the loſing of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, and ſee what it will profit to
be the world's Favourite, and God's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
To have the world ſpeak well of
you, and to have the Lord ſpeak againſt
you. To have the world well pleaſed with
us, and to lye uuder the diſpleaſure of an
Almighty God. To be the World's Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and God's Out-caſts. To be the
World's choſen ones, and to be God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates.
To have the world commend
us, and God condemn us? Surely, thoſe
that have a kindneſs for the World's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
do little know or conſider what the
Favour of God is, which they loſe by
gaining that. They little think, that in his
favour is life; and, that his favour is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than life. That it is his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> that
makes Heaven; and his Wrath and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
that makes Hell. Now compare
this gain of the World's Favour, with the
loſs of the Favour of God, and ſee what
reaſon you have to conform to the
World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:59219:55"/>
2. Conſider what you loſe, and what
you gain, by not conforming to this world;
and compare thoſe two together, and ſee
which doth preponderate.</p>
               <p>1. Conſider what is the loſs of not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
to the world. I have ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to this before, and ſhall be brief in
it here. All the loſs amounts but to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is only outward and temporal,
<hi>viz.</hi> Credit, a good report from the world,
a good repute with the world, worldly
peace, freedom from the world's troubles
and perſecutions, the World's Favour, and
its Preferments. The higheſt it can amount
to, is but loſs of Eſtate, loſs of Liberty,
loſs of Life. This is the ſum of what a
man loſeth by not complying with, and
not conforming to the world.</p>
               <p>2. Next, conſider what a man ſhall
gain by not conforming to the world.
This is the great thing every one is apt to
enquire after, <hi>If I do ſo, what ſhall I get
by it?</hi> As <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Maſter, we have left
all and followed thee; What ſhall we have?</hi>
So, if any ſhall ſay, We indeed hear that
it is our duty to be <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
World; and we know, ſuch a <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
is attended with many diſadvantages;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59219:55"/>
and we would gladly know what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
do attend ſuch a <hi>Nonconformity;</hi> and
whether they over-weigh the diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?
To ſatisfie ſuch, conſider what ſuch
a one gains who is a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> to the
World.</p>
               <p>1. He gains the love, and eſteem, and
good report of thoſe that are godly, and
that are really ſo. Chriſt hath ſome cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
precious ones in the World, redeemed
from the World, that are not of the world,
whoſe Names are written in Heaven, who
are Virgins, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> who are not defiled nor
ſpotted with the World's corruptions and
pollutions; you have a deſcription of
them, <hi>Rev. 14. 4, &amp;c.</hi> ſuch as vvalk in the
ſteps of Chriſt here, and ſhall vvalk vvith
Chriſt in vvhite hereafter. Novv conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Your not conforming to the World,
vvill gain the good report of theſe. What
the Apoſtle ſaith, (Heb. 11. 2. <hi>By faith the
Elders obtained a good report)</hi> may I ſay,
By this <hi>Nonconformity</hi> you vvill obtain a
good report from thoſe that are truly and
ſincerely good. Novv compare this gain
vvith the fore-mentioned loſs: What is
it to loſe the good vvord of a Drunkard, a
Swearer, a filthy wicked prophane perſon,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59219:56"/>
and to be vvell reported of by thoſe that
are holy and pious? Let me tell you, Next
to God's Approbation, the Approbation
of thoſe that are godly, is moſt deſirable.
What comfort vvill this give a man upon
his dying-bed, that all the Drunkards and
Prophane perſons in the Countrey, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him, and ſpeak vvell of him? Our
Saviour ſaid, <hi>Wo to you when all men ſhall
ſpeak well of you:</hi> and ſurely then, Wo to
that man of vvhom none can ſpeak vvell,
but only ſuch as are vvicked.</p>
               <p>2. By <hi>not conforming</hi> to the World,
you vvill not only gain a <hi>good report</hi> from
<hi>godly men,</hi> but alſo from <hi>God</hi> himſelf: let me
tell you, They are ſuch as God makes high
account of, whom Jeſus Chriſt highly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
and vvhom the Angels in Heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
over. Look but into Scripture, and
ſee hovv highly God commends thoſe
vvho are <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to the men of
their generation: The Apoſtle (in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.)
ſpeaks of the Faith of the holy men of old,
as <hi>Enoch,</hi> of vvhom it's ſaid, <hi>he walked with
God;</hi> and of <hi>Noah,</hi> who by building the
Ark upon the vvarning he had from God,
condemned the World. Let me tell you
vvhat the Apoſtle ſpeaks of all them there
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59219:56"/>
in relation to their <hi>Faith,</hi> we may ſpeak of
them in relation to their <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to
the world; that, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>by Faith they obtained a good report;</hi>
ſo, by their <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the world.
What was <hi>Enoch,</hi> but a <hi>Nonconformiſt?</hi>
What was <hi>Noah,</hi> but a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> to
the men of his generation? What were
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> but <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts</hi>
to the world, when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſaid of them, <hi>v.</hi> 13. that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<hi>that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims
on the earth;</hi> that they <hi>did look after a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Countrey, (i.e.)</hi> a heavenly one? What
was <hi>Moſes</hi> but a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> to this
World, <hi>who refuſed to be called the ſon of
Pharoah's daughter; who choſe rather to
ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than
to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; who
eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
than the treaſures of Egypt?</hi> This is
an eminent and high demonſtration of his
<hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the World. And ſo I
might ſpeak of the reſt, who were all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<hi>of whom the world was not worthy; who
obtained a good report from God;</hi> and of
whom we may ſay as the Apoſtle doth,
<hi>(Heb.</hi> 11. 13.) <hi>All theſe dyed in faith:</hi> So
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59219:57"/>
all theſe lived and dyed <hi>Nonconformists</hi> to
the World. How highly and honourably
doth the Lord (in Scripture) ſpeak of
theſe <hi>Nonconformiſts?</hi> Non doubt but the
men of their generation looked upon them
as men ſingular, factious, humorous, as ſuch
that delighted to be unlike their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
But the Lord ſpeaks of them as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and precious, and ſuch of whom
the World was not worthy. Now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
theſe together, and ſee whether is
better, To be well reported of by the
World, or to be well reported of by God?
What though the World account ſuch <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Fools,</hi> if the Lord call ſuch <hi>the only wiſe
in the world?</hi> It is not whom the World
commends, but whom God commends, that
are praiſe-worthy indeed. <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the
bleſſing of <hi>Joſeph, Deut.</hi> 33. 16. he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to him <hi>the good-will of him that dwelt
in the buſh.</hi> To have the good-will and
the good-word of God, is that that is moſt
deſirable in this life.</p>
               <p>3. That you may be <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to
this World, Be much in comparing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Rules and Patterns, Thoſe of the
<hi>Word,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>World.</hi> Take a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59219:57"/>
view of both, and then conſider theſe
three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Which are most worthy your
conformity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To which you are moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and engaged to conform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By your conformity to which,
you ſhall moſt benefit and advantage your
ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider, whether the Rules and
Examples of the <hi>Word,</hi> or of the <hi>World,</hi>
be moſt worthy of your conformity. So
conſider,</p>
               <p>1. What the World's Rules, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and Preſcriptions are. You will
find them to be all corrupt, erroneous,
baſe, unclean, unholy. And you will find
its Examples ſuch likewiſe: The Rules it
hath, by which it doth and acts things, and
by which it judgeth of things, are all
naught. Who can bring a clean thing out
of an unclean, ſaith <hi>Job?</hi> And how can a
filthy and unclean World, preſcribe Rules
that are otherwiſe? Take a ſurvey of its
Rules; 1. For judging of things; It makes
this one of its great Rules by which it
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59219:58"/>
judgeth of things, Whether they be Good
or Evil, by the ſuitableneſs or unſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
there is in them, to ſinful fleſh, and
corrupt nature. I might name many other
Rules of the like nature; but for brevity's
ſake I omit them. 2. For its Rules for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
they are ſinful and corrupt too. I
ſhall name you ſome, (viz.) <hi>To do as the
moſt do,</hi> is one Rule. <hi>To do as the greatest
do,</hi> is another Rule. <hi>To do as our Anceſtors
and Fore-fathers did,</hi> (who lived in dark
and corrupt times) is another Rule. <hi>To do
what reſpects our outward eaſe, and credit,
and quiet, in this world, that we may ſleep
in a whole skin,</hi> is another Rule. In a
word, <hi>To do what is good in our own eyes,</hi>
and <hi>to do what tends to the pleaſing and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of our luſts,</hi> is another Rule. I might
name more; but let theſe ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Next, for the World's Patterns and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
take a view of them: You will
find them all corrupt and naught. If you
look with a right eye upon them, you will
find they all have ugly, baſe, ſinful inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on them; as of Prophaneneſs, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,
Swearing, Covetouſneſs, Pride,
Luxury, Uncleanneſs, and of all Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
Atheiſm, Indifferency in Religion,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59219:58"/>
Lukewarmneſs, Denying the power of
Godlineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such are the World's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
And ſo I have ſhew'd you what
the World's Rules for judging and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
are; and what its Patterns and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
are, All naught.</p>
               <p>2. Now I ſhall come to ſhew you, what
the Rules and Examples of the Word are,
that ſo upon comparing them together,
you may ſee which are moſt worthy of
your conformity. As for the Rules of the
Word, they are holy, they are pure, they
are perfect; ſo are all the Rules of the
Word, both for judging of things, and
for practice.</p>
               <p>1. For the Rules preſcribed us in the
Word, they are all pure: I might name
many; but among others, take theſe
three.</p>
               <p>1. The VVord teacheth us to judg of
things as God judgeth of them, whoſe
judgment is according to truth; the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the VVorld is according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and corrupt phantaſie.</p>
               <p>2. The Word teacheth us to judg of
things as they have relation to the Soul.
That, that is good which is good for the
Soul, which tends to the making of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59219:59"/>
us more Holy and Heavenly.</p>
               <p>3. The Word teacheth us to judg of
things to be good or evil, as they relate to
a man's future and eternal ſtate. So, thoſe
things to be good, that concern a man's
eternal well being; and thoſe things to be
evil, that relate to eternal miſery.</p>
               <p>Thus for the Rules of judging of things.</p>
               <p>Next, for the Rules of Practice, I ſhall
name ſome (of many) to you; you will
find them all holy and pure.</p>
               <p>1. Is this; Doing what pleaſeth God,
not what pleaſeth men. Pleaſing God,
whom ever we diſpleaſe. This is a Rule in
the Word, for practice; it telleth us, We
ſhould not be the ſervants of men, to pleaſe
their ſinful humours, and luſts, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>2. To do as the <hi>beſt</hi> do, and not as the
<hi>moſt</hi> do: where, by <hi>[beſt]</hi> we mean not
<hi>the beſt of the Pariſh,</hi> who are accounted ſo
for their Riches, and Lands, and Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but the <hi>best</hi> in reſpect of Godlineſs
and Holineſs.</p>
               <p>3. In all things we do, to prefer <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
before <hi>ſinning.</hi> To chuſe Affliction ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Sin. It gives us to conſider, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59219:59"/>
the leaſt evil of Sin, hath more evil in it
than the greateſt evil of Suffering.</p>
               <p>4. In all we do, to reſpect more inward,
than outward peace. To regard (moſt)
peace in our own Spirits and Conſciences.
To remember what the Martyr ſaid, <hi>There
were no Stocks to the Stocks of an evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
To have a care to preſerve the
Bird in our boſome.</p>
               <p>5. Doing good, and avoiding evil,
though with diſadvantage to our ſelves,
when the good concerns eternal life, and
the diſadvantage only this life.</p>
               <p>Thus for ſome of the Rules for practice.</p>
               <p>Next, for the Patterns and Examples
that the VVord of God holds out to us.
You will find them all holy, having the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
of Heaven and Holineſs on
them. So it propounds to us, for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
the Examples, (Firſt) Of Jeſus
Chriſt. Secondly, Of Holy men, and ſuch
as were Followers of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>1. Of Jeſus Chriſt So it holds him out to us
as our great Pattern to imitate. It ſhews us
the ſteps of his Humility, Meekneſs, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
Obedience, Holineſs, Heavenlineſs-</p>
               <p>2. It holds out to us the Examples of
Holy men, for our imitation, more famous
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59219:60"/>
in their Generation than others, for their
Faith, Piety, Patience, Holineſs, Zeal, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 12: <hi>Be ye followers of them who through
faith and patience inherit the Promiſes.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
the Scripture propounds to us for
our example, ſuch as inherit the Promiſes
of God; the VVorld propounds ſuch as
inherit the Threatnings of God. The
Word propounds to us for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
ſuch as now are in Heaven.
The VVorld propounds ſuch, who (for
ought we know) are either in Hell, or in
the road-way to Hell. Now, Chriſtians, I
have given you a brief <hi>ſpecimen</hi> and view
of the VVorld's Rules and Examples, and
of thoſe of the VVord; and now compare
them together, and judg which are moſt
worthy of your conformity. Upon your
comparing them together, you will find
the reſult to be this.</p>
               <p>1. That the Rules and Examples of the
VVord are more high, and noble, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
than thoſe of the VVorld: The
VVorld's Rules and Examples are low and
baſe; and a Chriſtian debaſeth himſelf in
conforming to them; they are below a
Chriſtian's Calling, they are below a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's
Spirit, they are below a Chriſtian's
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59219:60"/>
Profeſſion, they are below a Chriſtian's
Hope and Expectation; and ſo muſt needs
be too low for his conformity and imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Man is an excellent Creature, he was
made a little lower than the Angels; ſo that
(next to the Angels) he is the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Creatures. And God, that gave Man
a noble Being, gave him alſo a noble Rule
to live and walk by. As God made not
man to be his own End, neither did he
make him to be his own Rule. From whom
he received his Being, he was to receive his
Rule. His Rule was, the Will and Law of
his Creator; and herein ſtood his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
in conforming to that Rule. When
man conformed to another Rule, he loſt
his excellency. <hi>God made man upright, but</hi>
(as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>they have found out many
inventions.</hi> So, God made Man excellent;
but having found out other Rules to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to, than thoſe of his Creator, they
have loſt their excellency. There was a
high and noble Rule, for a high and noble
Creature; and that Rule is, the Rule of
the Word, which contains the revealed
Will of the Creator.</p>
               <p>2. You will find this, upon comparing
them together, That the Rules and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59219:61"/>
of the Word are more pure and holy,
than thoſe of the World. Conſider what
is ſaid of the Word of God, and what is
ſaid of the World: Of the Word of God
the Scripture ſaith, <hi>it is pure, very pure, as
Gold tryed in the fire ſeven times.</hi> Of the
World it's ſaid, that it is <hi>ſinful, evil,</hi> and
that <hi>it lieth in wickedneſs.</hi> Now, as the
Word is, ſo are its Rules; and as the
World is, ſo are its: A pure Word hath
pure Rules; and an impure VVorld muſt
needs preſcribe impure Rules. The higher
things are, the purer they are. VVhat is
Purity, but a freeneſs from all Contagion,
and touch of inferior things? That Gold
is impure, that is mixed with droſs; and
that Face and Garment is defiled, that is
ſpotted with dirt. Conſider, things are
pure <hi>ex contactu ſuperiorum:</hi> the higher
they are, and the more heavenly, the more
pure. And things are impure <hi>ex contactu
inferiorum;</hi> the lower things are, the more
impure. Now, upon this account, the Rules
and Precepts of the VVord moſt needs be
the pureſt, becauſe they are muſt high, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
heavenly. There is no <hi>ſcoria,</hi> no droſs
at all in them. And as for the Examples of
the VVord, they are holy and heavenly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59219:61"/>
ones, that are propounded to us for our
conformity and imitation.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>It's true, ſome may here except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Examples, and ſay,</hi> What, was
there no droſs in them? Had not the beſt
Saints their failings and corruptions? Were
they perfectly pure, without ſtain or blemiſh?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this we anſwer: That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
and Patterns that the VVord of
God holds out to us for our imitation, are
(as I told you before) of two ſorts: thoſe
<list>
                     <item>1. Of Jeſus Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>2. Of Holy men.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Example of Jeſus Chriſt Now
his Example is without, and beyond all
exception; it is perfectly pure. He hath
left us his ſteps to tread in; and upon view
of them it wil never be found that he trod
one ſtep awry. <hi>He did no ſin, neither was
guile found in his mouth.</hi> He made this
challenge to his moſt bitter and obſerving
Adverſaries, <hi>Which of you convinceth me
of ſin?</hi> He was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59219:62"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59219:62"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59219:64"/>
               <p>2. As for the Examples of Holy men,
againſt whom the Objection moſt lieth,
and of whom it muſt be confeſſed, that
they had their impurities; yet concerning
them, there is this to be ſaid.</p>
               <p>1. That though they had their impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
yet they had their purity, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was precious and excellent.
They were Gold, though there were ſome
droſs mixed with it: ſo that (comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
we may ſay they were pure. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the VVorld are altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure;
they are all droſs, and no Gold
mixed with them. They are altogether
corrupt, and have nothing of holineſs and
purity in them.</p>
               <p>2. This is to be conſidered, That God
in his VVord, propounding to us the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Holy men for our imitation, ſets
them out to us to be imitated by us in what
was good, not what was evil in them. The
holieſt men were in ſome things but men:
they had their black, as well as their bright
ſide. Now the Scripture ſhews us their
black ſide only for our caution; but their
bright ſide only for our imitation. In the
Scripture we ſee Saints in their Sins, and in
their Graces; and it is in their Graces only
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59219:64"/>
that they are held forth to us as Patterns
for our imitation. The great Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
bids them to whom he writes, to <hi>be
followers of him, as he was of Chriſt.</hi> VVe
are to eye Chriſt as our chiefeſt Pattern,
and to conform to the Examples of others,
as they are conformable to Jeſus Chriſt.
Particular Saints, had their particular
Graces and Excellencies. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi>
was eminent for his Faith, <hi>Job</hi> for his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<hi>Moſes</hi> for his Meekneſs, <hi>David</hi> for
his Zeal; and ſo for the reſt. And in theſe,
the Scripture propounds them to us as Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
for our imitation, in their Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
not in their Frailties. Thus the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is anſwered. And now conſider
what Rules and Examples are worthy of
your imitation and conformity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> You will find this, upon compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them together, That the Rules and
Examples of the VVord, have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and beſt, and higheſt approbation; and
in this they exceed thoſe of the VVorld;
this I ſhall ſhew you in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>1. They are approved of by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who is the Beſt and Greateſt. And
needs muſt it be ſo, when ſuch Rules are of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59219:65"/>
own making, and ſuch Examples of his
own ſtamping. To theſe God puts his Seal
of Approbation: but to thoſe of the
VVorld, that of his diſlike and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>2. They are thoſe Rules and Examples
that all that are godly approve of: by their
diſſenting from the other, they have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
their approbation of theſe. Read but
the <hi>119th Pſalm,</hi> and ſee how highly <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſpeaks forth his approbation of the
Law, and Teſtimonies, and Precepts of
God, and how he had choſen the way of
God's Precepts. And this godly men have
done under the greateſt perſecutions and
afflictions; they have then teſtified their
high approbation of the ways of God,
and have not accepted of deliverance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition of complying with the ſinful
ways of the VVorld: ſo you read of thoſe
ſufferers of old, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. what tortures
they endured, and all upon the account of
<hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the world.</p>
               <p>3. They are thoſe Rules and Examples
that will one day be approved of by all,
both good and bad. There is a day when
even wicked men themſelves will vote for
them. It is not much to be regarded what
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59219:65"/>
wicked men now think or ſpeak of them,
while they are in their proſperity, and in
the hot and eager purſuit of their Luſts.
Alas! they are not now themſelves; but
there is a day when they will be in cool
blood, when they wil be themſelves, when
they wil commend the ways of God, and
the Examples of thoſe holy ones they once
condemned; and wil wiſh they had choſen
the way of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
&amp;c. and not of <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and
<hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>4. You will find this, upon comparing
theſe Rules and Examples together, That
thoſe of the VVord are the ſafeſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to. In that conformity, there is a
ſafety for Eternity. In a conformity to
thoſe of the world, there is nothing but
danger, they are liable to be condemned
with the world; there is no ſafety in thoſe
ways, wherein there is no ſalvation to be
found. They that live the life of the
VVorld, muſt expect to periſh with the
VVorld. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith (Pſal. 125. 5.)
<hi>As for ſuch as turn aſide to crooked paths,
the Lord will lead them forth with the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of iniquity, (i.e.)</hi> God wil deal with
ſuch, as with wicked men. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59219:66"/>
us, (Prov. 10. 9.) <hi>He that walks uprightly
walks ſurely.</hi> It is a man's conformity to the
Rules and Examples of the VVord, that
ſpeaks him Upright; and in that lieth his
ſafety for Eternity.</p>
               <p>5. Upon comparing them, you will find,
That a conformity to the Rules and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the VVord, is that that is moſt
becoming Chriſtians. VVhat can more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Chriſtian, than to conform to thoſe
Rules and Examples that are moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
and holy.</p>
               <p>1. It becomes not a Chriſtian's Calling.
He is called from the world, he is called out
of the world, he is called to be unlike the
world, he is called to be an Heir of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, he is called to begin Heaven
on Earth; to begin it here in Grace, and to
enjoy it hereafter in Glory. Now Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
How doth a conformity to the world
agree and ſuit with your Calling? Doth it
become a man to wallow in the Mire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a Hog doth ſo?</p>
               <p>2. It is unbecoming a Chriſtian's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
As your Calling is, ſo is your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
holy. Do but reflect upon your
Baptiſmal-Covenant; Is not the VVorld
one of thoſe things you promiſe to forſake
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59219:66"/>
and renounce? And if ſo, How can you
conform to it? How can you that profeſs
your ſelves to be the ſervants of Chriſt, be
the ſervants of ſinful men? How can you
that profeſs your ſelves to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thoſe that are redeemed from the
world, comply with, and conform to the
world?</p>
               <p>3. Conformity to the world, is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Spirit of a Chriſtian. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
is to be one of an excellent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Spirit: And what hath an excellent
Spirit to do with baſe and low Rules and
Examples? Let me tell you, there is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Gallantry Chriſtians ſhould have, which
ſhould ſet them above ſuch a conformity,
with the greateſt diſdain and ſcorn. As
it's ſaid of <hi>Caleb, (Numb.</hi> 14. 24.) He had
<hi>another Spirit.</hi> What have holy Spirits to
do with ſinful Rules? And, What have
heavenly Spirits to do with worldly and
earthly Examples?</p>
               <p>6. Upon comparing them together,
you will find, That a Conformity to the
Rules and Examples of the Word, is moſt
<hi>Conſolative.</hi> There is more comfort in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
to the Word, than in conforming
to the World. What comfort will the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59219:67"/>
thoughts of your conforming to a ſinful
wicked World, give you? when you come
to lye on your laſt and dying-beds, What
comfort will a conformity to the World
reflect? Oh that men would conſider what
will give them peace at the laſt! Conſider
this you covetous Tradeſmen, that uſe falſe
Meaſures and Ballances, and that deal in
falſe Wares: the ſaying is, <hi>Leight Gains
make an heavy Purſe;</hi> but take heed they
make not an heavy and accuſing Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the end. It is the way of the World
to get gain any way, but never conſider
what the iſſue will be, whether it will be
comfort and peace at laſt. It was the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a worthy Judg of this Nation, to
his Son when he was a dying, <hi>Son, I leave
you but a ſmall Eſtate, but it was well gotten.</hi>
Oh that men could ſay ſo of their Eſtates
(whether great or ſmall), <hi>That they were
well gotten!</hi> Let the cunning, covetous,
worldly Tradeſman, know, That he may
as well rob a man in his Shop, with a mete-Yard,
and a pair of Ballances in his hand,
as a Thief doth with Sword and Piſtol on
the Road; and although they are not alike
arraigned at the Barr of Man's Tribunal,
yet they will be alike at the Barr of God's
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59219:67"/>
Tribunal. And as for you prophane ones,
What comfort will the thoughts of
your ſinful pleaſures, delights, and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
reflect when you come to dye? What
pleaſure will it then be to you, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the ſinful jollities and debaucheries of
a fore-paſſed life? Know this, that one
hour ſpent in communion with God, will
yeeld a man more ſolid comfort, than all
the days a man hath ſpent in the Tents of
wickedneſs. He ſaid it, that had proved
it, Pſal. 84. 10. <hi>A day in thy Courts, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a thouſand,</hi> &amp;c. And let me tell
you, A day ſpent in ſerving God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
to his Will and Word, doing what
is well-pleaſing in his ſight; will yeeld
more comfort than a thouſand ſpent in
complying with, and conforming to the
ſinful faſhions, pleaſures, and examples of
the World. Nay, What ſad reflections will
the thoughts of ſuch a compliance cauſe?
That proud Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> when he
was caſt out of the favour of his Prince,
and was under the apprehenſion of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
death, ſaid, <hi>If I had been as
careful of ſerving and pleaſing God, as I
have been to ſerve and pleaſe my King; he
had not now forſaken me in this my miſery.</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:59219:68"/>
And ere long men will wiſh, they had been
as careful in conforming to the will of God
revealed in his Word, as they have been
to the wills of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ways of the
World; and repent of it when its too
late.</p>
               <p>7. Upon comparing theſe together,
you will find, That a conformity to the
Rules and Examples of the Word, is a
Chriſtian's Wiſdom; and that all <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi>
to the World, will at the laſt be
found but fools, as the Prophet <hi>(Jer.</hi> 17.
11). ſaith, <hi>He that getteth riches, and not
by right, at his end ſhall be a fool.</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
who in the end will be the verieſt
fools, <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> or <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> to
the World? <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had
told the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of the Statutes of
God, this is one Motive he makes uſe of to
preſs them to an obſervation of them, <hi>v.</hi> 6.
<hi>This will be your wiſdom in the ſight of the
Nations.</hi> Let me tell you, A <hi>Conformity</hi> to
the Word, and a <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the
World, is a Chriſtian's Wiſdom. There
is a day coming, when thoſe who now for
not conforming to the world, are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fools, will not only be pronounced
<hi>wife,</hi> by the teſtimony of God, and Chriſt,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59219:68"/>
and Angels, but alſo by thoſe that now
eſteem and call them Fools. Let me tell
you, What is the judgment and opinion
of wicked men now concerning Holineſs
and Holy ones, will not always be their
judgment; they will one day be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mind. Now, indeed, <hi>the wiſdom of
God is fooliſhneſs with the world;</hi> when, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is the <hi>wiſdom of the world that is
fooliſhneſs with God.</hi> In the Word of God,
and the laws and rules which it preſcribes,
is ſeen the Wiſdom of God: And thoſe muſt
needs be the wiſeſt who conform to thoſe
Rules. Conforming to the World's Rules,
is conforming to the World's Wiſdom,
which indeed is conforming to the World's
Wickedneſs; and the wiſeſt of ſuch <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
(except they repent) will ere long
call themſelves Fools to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Now, having compared all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
tell me, Whether the Rules and
Examples of the Word, or of the World,
are moſt worthy of your conformity.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the <hi>Firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We come next to enquire,
To which you are moſt obliged and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59219:69"/>
to conform, To the Word of God,
or to the World. And here I ſhall put this
Queſtion to you, viz. <hi>To whom you owe
moſt, whether to God, or the world?</hi> So I
muſt ask you two things:
<list>
                     <item>1. Which hath done moſt for you?</item>
                     <item>2. Which can do moſt for you?</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. Which hath done moſt for you, God
or the VVorld? To whom owe you your
Beings? VVho created you, God or the
world? Then tell me, to whom you owe
your conformity? To whom owe you
your Redemption? Who ſent a Saviour
into the world to dye for you; and by
that death to purchaſe pardon, and peace,
and reconciliation, and eternal ſalvation?
To whom do you owe your lives? Who
endued your ſouls with life, and hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
held your ſouls in life? Or whoſe
Mercies is it, that you have not ere this
been conſumed? Is it of the Lord's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or of the World's? From whom have
you had protection and deliverance from
dangers? Whoſe Angels are it that have
pitch'd their Tents about you, God's, or
the World's? From whom do you receive
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59219:69"/>
all your bleſſings, of health, wealth, food,
raiment? Is it from God, or the World?
See, by this, to which you owe your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider, which can do moſt for you.
What can the world do for you? Doth it,
or can it bid more for your conformity,
than God doth? As <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid to his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
when he ſaw they were addicted to
<hi>David</hi>'s Party, <hi>Can the Son of Jeſſe give
you Vineyards, or Olive-yards,</hi> &amp;c. So let me
ask you, Can the world give you what
God can? All that the world can do for
you, doth but amount, to what is tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
But can it give you that which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?
Let me tell you, It is ſo far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, that though it can give a man Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Riches, yet it cannot give a man
Contentment with them; much leſs can
it give inward comfort, and peace, and
aſſurance of Eternal Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
All this, God bids for your confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to him. And now ſee to which you
moſt owe your conformity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> VVe are next to enquire, By
which you will be moſt advantaged,
whether by a conformity to God, or the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59219:70"/>
world? To this I have ſpoken largely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when I ſhew'd you the Gain and Loſs
of <hi>Conformity</hi> and <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the
world. I ſhall only here put you upon the
conſideration of two things:
<list>
                     <item>1. Which promiſeth moſt.</item>
                     <item>2. Which threatneth moſt.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. Which promiſeth moſt, the <hi>Word</hi> or
the <hi>World:</hi> Look over the promiſes of the
<hi>Word,</hi> and tell me, whether the <hi>World</hi> can
promiſe what God in his <hi>Word</hi> doth? Can
it promiſe you, That by conforming to
its Statutes and Laws, it ſhall be well with
you and your children for ever? The
world cannot promiſe you a long and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
life here; much leſs can it promiſe you
eternal life and happineſs hereafter.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider, which threatneth moſt:
whoſe threatnings are moſt dreadful and
terrible, thoſe of the <hi>Word,</hi> or of the
<hi>World:</hi> It's true, the world can thunder
out threatnings againſt thoſe that conform
not to her: But tell me, Is that Thunder
like, in terror, to that thunder we hear in
the word, and the threatnings of it, againſt
thoſe that conform to a wicked world?
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59219:70"/>
The world can threaten with Bonds and
Impriſonments, with Fire and Faggot: But
God threatens with Hell, and everlaſting
burnings. As the Martyr told the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
that threatned him with impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Tu Carcerem, ille Gehennam:</hi> Thou
threatneſt me with a Priſon, but God
threatens me with Hell. Remember the
counſel of our Saviour, Matt. 10. 28. <hi>Fear
not them which kill the body, but are not
able to kill the ſoul; but rather fear him
which is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul
in Hell.</hi> And now you have heard all this,
conſider ſeriouſly of it, and tell me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the world is worthy your conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
or, whether you are at all engaged to
conform to the world; or, whether it will
be any advantage to you to conform to
the world, and not rather an infinite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage?</p>
               <p>And thus much for the Directions in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
and in theſe Directions are wrap'd
up the Motives to move us to be <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi>
to this world.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now cloſe all, with giving you ſome
particular Directions, as further Means
and Helps againſt Conformity to this
world: and that briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59219:71"/>
1. Conſider your natural inclinations,
and remember there is, by nature, in us a
ſtrong propenſity to a conformity to the
world. The world is a tempting, alluring,
bewitching thing, apt to ſteal away our
hearts, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> did the hearts of the
men of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It will court, invite, and
tempt; it will flatter and fawn, to gain a
conformity; it hath tempting rules, tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
examples, tempting proffers, and much
more, to draw men into a conformity to
her. Now, Chriſtians, you had need be
watchful in this caſe, upon conſidering in
what danger you are, to be deluded by the
world; and that upon two accounts.</p>
               <p>1. You live among thoſe that are of
the world, and therefore apt to be infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was by living in
<hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Court; and <hi>Peter,</hi> by being in
the High-Prieſt's Hall. Rivers partake
of the nature of the ſoil through which
they run; and it is a difficult thing to live
in the world, and not to have a taſte of the
ſins and corruptions of it.</p>
               <p>2. Remember, you have (even the beſt)
the remainders of corruption in you.
There are the remainders of ſelf, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59219:71"/>
ſo a love of worldly Credity, of outward
Eaſe, of worldly Enjoyments; and theſe
will be as a Byas to the Bowl, which will
encline you toward the world, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to it.</p>
               <p>2. That you may be <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to
this world, Grow and encreaſe in love to
Jeſus Chriſt. The more we love Jeſus
Chriſt, the leſs we ſhall love the world.
Any ſinful compliance with the world, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
either no love, or litle love to Jeſus
Chriſt. Love is the great worker of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as Hatred is of averſation. Thoſe
that love Jeſus Chriſt, will live to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt; and will be ſuch to whom the
world is crucifi'd, and they unto the world:
Such will ſay as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>To us to live,
is Chriſt.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt will be the <hi>All</hi> of
their lives; all the Rule; and all the End
of their living.</p>
               <p>3. That you may be <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to
the world, Meditate much of Chriſt's
love to you; by that you will come to
know, you owe all your conformity to
Him, Right thoughts of this, will cauſe
the world to be crucified to you, and you
to the world; that neither the world
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59219:72"/>
ſhall care for you; not you for it.</p>
               <p>4. Remember where Chriſt is: He is
no more in this world, in reſpect of his
corporal Preſence; he is aſcended into
Heaven; he is there preparing Manſions
for his: he hath left you ſteps on earth, in
which you are to tread and in which you
are to follow him, if you deſire to be
where he is. So that, this conſidered, a
conformity to the world can never conſiſt
with a Chriſtian's aims of being with
Chriſt hereafter, and to behold, his glory.
He now being in Heaven, is drawing the
hearts and affections of thoſe up to him,
who are to be for ever with him.</p>
               <p>5. Be much in ſearching the Scriptures:
where you may view, as the Rules you
are to walk by, ſo the examples you are to
imitate; you will there have Glaſſes, by
which you are to dreſs your ſelves: you
will there find the pure example of him
who was holy, undefiled, without ſpot
and blemiſh, <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. You
will there find the Examples of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, who were <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to the
men of their generation.</p>
               <p>6. Be much in prayer, That God would
deliver you from this preſent evil world;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59219:72"/>
That you may not be led into temptation,
but may be delivered from the evil of it.
Pray, that God would carry you above
the world, and over all the good and evil
of it, without being infected or hurt by it.</p>
               <p>7. Remember what your condition in
this world is. If you profeſs your ſelves
Chriſtians, then you profeſs your ſelves to
be ſtrangers and pilgrims in the world:
and a conformity to this world, cannot
conſiſt with ſuch a profeſſion. What have
ſtrangers to do with a conformity to that
place, through which they paſs only as
travellers, and where they lodg only as
pilgrims?</p>
               <p>8. Remember, you are for Eternity,
and that you live upon the borders of it.
Think not ſo much where at preſent you
are, as where you ſhortly muſt be. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Conformiſt</hi> to this world, there is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs
of Eternity. How can thoſe
that think of an Eternal world that is
drawing near to them, and they to it, give
up themſelves to a conformity to a world
that is paſſing away? Remember, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
now calls <hi>on</hi> you, and will ſhortly call
<hi>for</hi> you.</p>
               <p>9. Encreaſe in Self-denyal, It is the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59219:73"/>
ſelf-denying Chriſtian, that is the <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi>
Chriſtian to the world. Such a
Chriſtian will regard neither the world's
favours, nor the world's frowns. Such a
Chriſtian will ſay as <hi>Luther</hi> did, <hi>I deſpiſe
both the world's favour, and the world's
fury.</hi> The ſelf-denying Chriſtian is one
whom the world may both flatter and
frown on; but he ſtands like an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
Rock, not ſhaken by either.</p>
               <p>10. Encreaſe in the mortification of
your worldly luſts. Not mortifying theſe,
hath reduced ſome to a conformity to the
world, who ſeemed to have eſcaped the
pollutions of it: This was the undoing of
<hi>Demas,</hi> who forſook both his Miniſtry,
and the fellowſhip of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to embrace
this preſent world; and (as ſome are of
opinion) became an Idol-Prieſt at <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi>
upon the account of filthy lucre,
and worldly gain.</p>
               <p>11. Strengthen Faith, whereby you
will be ſtrengthened to overcome this
preſent evil world. The Apoſtle tells us,
(1 John 5. 4.) <hi>This is the victory whereby we
overcome this world, even our faith.</hi> It will
make us couragious to out-face a ſinful
world. It is the evidence of things not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59219:73"/>
ſeen, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. and will work in us a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the things that are ſeen. It will
be the eye, by which, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> we ſhall
ſee him that is Inviſible, and therby keep us
from a conforming to a viſible world, upon
greateſt temptations, though they be the
pleaſures and promotions of a <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s
Court. The more <hi>faith,</hi> the leſs <hi>fear;</hi> and
it is baſe fear and cowardiſe, that often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays
to a ſinful compliance with, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the world. The more <hi>believing</hi>
Chriſtians are, the leſs <hi>conforming</hi> they are
to this world. To cloſe all, let me mind
you of what the Lord ſpeaks to <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi>
and that I ſay to all Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
complying with, and conforming
to the world, Jer. 15. 19. <hi>Therefore thus
ſaith the Lord, If thou return, then will I
bring thee again, and thou ſhalt ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me: And if thou take forth the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
from the vile, thou ſhalt be as my mouth.
Let them return unto thee, but return not
thou unto them.</hi>
