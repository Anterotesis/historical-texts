         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Good Council and Advice Unto All PROFESSORS</head>
            <p>In whom there is any tenderneſs and breathings after the Lord, and the knowledge of his way.</p>
            <p>By one that hath in the Light of the LORD ſeen through them all, into the reſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place that is prepared for them that truly fear the Lord.</p>
            <p>Hear all you Profeſſors of the Towns of <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Hardingſtone,</hi> you whoſe Profeſion is waxed old as a Garment; Hearken you that border about them, and are thereunto adjoining, liſten as you that are Inhabitants, for unto you it doth belong.</p>
            <p>THE onely true God that framed the Heavens, and laid the Foundations of the Earth, that created and made mankind in his own likeneſs, hath look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down from Heaven, and hath beheld and ſeen how mankind is degenerated and fallen from that eſtate in the which he was made &amp; brought forth, and hath committed the two great abominations <hi>in forſaking the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fountain</hi> and Well-ſpring of life, and <hi>digged to themſelves bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ciſterns that will hold no water</hi>: And now the only wiſe God hath decreed a Decree, and determined a Determination, and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Purpoſe that muſt ſtand; which is to try all ſorts of people and profeſſors under what name or title ſoever they may be known or called, that the Bearer may be known from the Hearer, and the Sayer from the Doer. And now <hi>awake, awake, awake, Ariſe</hi> all you profeſſors, come forth, and lay aſide all your Fig-leafed garments, and all your high notions of words, and come to the Word that is ingrafted, which is able to ſave the ſoul that is immortal, that hath lain low, and hath been oppreſſed under all this Profeſſion, which hath not enjoyed the inviſible Life, which onely this could ſatisfie: And now it ſlandeth every one in hand, diligently to ſearch, and truly to try and examine themſelves whether they be in the Faith that giveth victory over the World, the which ſlandeth in the Power of God, Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the World, who is the Rock of Ages, the ſure Foundation upon which the holy men of God (in ages and generations paſt) were built, and their Faith, Hope and Confidence was in him onely; and ſo every one is to come to him which was the Rock of Ages and Generations paſt, and is the Rock of this preſent Age; and bleſſed are they that are built there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: For verily profeſſors, you that have built, and are yet buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with Hey, Straw and Stubble, which wil not abide the fire, but with it are to be burned up, and there ſhall be none found to quench it; therefore every one before you again begin to build, try what you build upon; for in vain, and to no purpoſe will it be for you to build upon that which hath not been tryed: And come out of theſe changeable things, and out of all thoſe noiſes, and crying up one thing for truth one while, and then for another time throw it down again, and ſay it was Erroneous, Superſtition and Popery, and ſuch like, and was to be aboliſhed and diſannul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and now cry the ſame up for Truth again: But now come and wait upon the Lord, and come into that in which there is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning, that when you are turning to the right hand, or to the left, the ſtil ſmall Voice you may come to hear, ſaying, <hi>This is the way, walk in it</hi>; the Voice that calleth for Purity, and (out of prophaneneſs) for Equity, and to do unto all men as you would that they ſhould do unto you: And though for a long time the Light hath ſhone in your dark hearts, and hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times reproved you in ſecret when you did do, or ſpeak that which you ought not to have acted or ſpoken; yet this I ſay, turn, turn to that which reproves you; for that which maketh manifeſt is Light, and the reproof of Inſtruction is the way to Life; and as it is written in the Scriptures of Truth, <hi>This is the condemnation of the world, that Light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their deeds are evil</hi>; but they that love the Light, and thereunto are turned, bring their Works and Deeds to the Light, that with it they may be proved whether they be wrought in God, yea or nay: But they that love their evil deeds more then the Light, will not bring them to the Light, becauſe it wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them. So now, flee from the <hi>Mountains,</hi> and eſcape from the <hi>Hills,</hi> and none any longer ſeek to hide your ſelves in the <hi>Cliſts</hi> of the <hi>raggy Rocks</hi>; for now the Lord is riſen from amongſt all theſe Sects, and various Opinions, and diverſities of Judgements, and changeable forms of Worſhip that are not come (neither will be perſwaded) to forſake their evil deeds, and come to that which changeth not, but liveth and abideth for euer.</p>
            <p>And now dear people this is the day of the lord, and none of you put it afar off; verily the bowels of my Love flow forth unto you, and my heart is even broken in the remembrance of you: Oh, how have you pierced the Jus;t One, and grieved the good Spirit of God in you from day to day, and would have none of his Counſel, neither hearken to his reproof, but have caſt his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Law behind your backs, and done deſpight to the Spirit of Grace! And now it would be juſt from the Lord, that the day of your Viſitation ſhould paſs over your heads, which cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be recalled, but for the Seeds ſake, and thoſe in whom there is any tenderneſs yet remains, and true breathings after the Lord, which are not yet gathered unto the Lord, and to his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Witneſs in them; in this their day there is a little dramm more of time added unto it, that they may be tryed unto the full, whether they will return to the Lord that they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved out of the mouths of the Lyons, and out of the paw of the Bear, and eſcape the wrath of the Almighty, and the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcourge that is coming upon the heads of the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, that hate the Lord, and deſires not the knowledge of his way; the which, neither hills nor mountains can ſtop or hinder, but it will them overtake unavoidably.</p>
            <p>Written by the movings of the Spirit of the Lord; and in Love unto all that have deſires after him, and are ſeeking of him where he is not to be found; By one whoſe Natural birth-right was, and Outward being is, in the Town of <hi>Hardingſtone</hi> in <hi>North-Hampton-ſhire</hi>; who am known to many people by the name of,<lb/>
WILLIAM GREEN.</p>
            <p>Unto you Prieſts and Profeſſors of the Towns above mentioned, in particular is this chiefly written and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth; and by the Author thereof you are deſired to communicate is one to another; but the ſervice thereof reacheth unto all which in theſe things menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, are concerned, where ever this may come.</p>
