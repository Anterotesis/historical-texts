            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Apoll.</hi> mentions Many, in which not only the choicest Trees and Fruits, the most sweet and beautiful Flowers, the most fragrant and lasting Greens, but Multitudes of living Creatures of the selectest sorts were enclosed; whence <hi>Aul.

               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Paradise</hi> was not Allegorical or Figurative, (according to <hi>Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and others) is not only confirmed by the general Consent of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers; nor Fantastical, according to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Cabbala: But a part of <hi>Asia,</hi> where <hi>Babylon</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards built, and known by the Name of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> as lying between the <hi>Euphrates</hi> and the <hi>Tygris;</hi> both the Description of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Nature of the Soil, and the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of many places of Scripture most evidently make out. Of the Fertility of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> gives this Testimony, <hi>Resudat toto ferè solo humor, qui ex utroque amne (Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrate &amp; Tigri) manat per aquarum vends, &amp; solo Babylonico foelicitatem affert maximam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Garden of God, as it is called <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 10. abounding with all things, the choicest and most excellent the Earth ever bore, God seated our great Progenitors, in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so superlatively happy, that our blessed Saviour was pleased by it to Typifie the high and happy State of Everlasting Life, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 43. <hi>This day thou shalt be with me in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Forfeiture of this Innocent and Blissful Seat, by the Disobedience of our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and their deserved Expulsion out of this <hi>Paradise,</hi> is the sad Subject of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd Poem.</p>
               <p>V. 2. <hi>The Fruit of that Forbidden Tree.</hi> It imports not much to know, nor can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, what kind this Interdicted Tree was of, the Prohibition having no regard to, or influence on, its Fruit, more than that it was made the Trial of Man's entire Obedience to his Maker. <hi>Moses Barcepha</hi> endeavours to prove it a Fig-Tree, because the Offenders had its Leaves so ready at hand to cover their Nakedness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 7. But this implies no more, than that a Tree of that kind, stood in its dangerous Neighborhood. It seemeth on the contrary, not reasonable to imagine, <hi>Adam</hi> should presume to cloath his Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Consequence of his Offence, with the Leaves of the same Tree, the Eating of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66206:3"/>
whose Fruit had been the cause of his Offending; especially when according to <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 3. the Prohibition was so strict and severe, that it had been a Daring second to his shameful Sin, but to have touch'd that sacred Tree; sacred (as our Author tells us) to Abstinence, secluded and set apart from all Enjoyment.</p>
               <p>The common Opinion, That this Tree so set apart, and secluded by God's Command, was an Apple-Tree, is weakly grounded on <hi>Cantic.</hi> 8. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>&amp;c. sub arbore malo suscitavi te. Ibi corrupta est mater tua, ibi violata est genetrix tua,</hi> more expressive of the Original than our Translation, <hi>I raised thee up under an Apple-Tree, there thy Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thee, there she conceived that bare thee:</hi> But this excellent Song is wholly Allegorical, and not to be literally understood.</p>
               <p>V. 2. <hi>Whose mortal taste; Mortalis,</hi> Lat. deadly: The taste of this Forbidden Fruit is called Deadly, not as such in its own Nature, and therefore prohibited; but by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, being made the Test of Man's Obedience, became pernicious to him by violating his Creator's Command, and brought forth Death and Hell.</p>
               <p>V. 4. <hi>With loss of EDEN;</hi> Of <hi>Paradise,</hi> which by God was planted Eastward in <hi>Eden,</hi> as to the place where <hi>Moses</hi> wrote, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 8. though <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifies Pleasure and Delight, from whence perhaps the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and also <hi>Adonis horti,</hi> from some knowledge the Ancient Poets had of the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and this Garden of <hi>Eden.</hi> And although St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and after him <hi>Cajetan</hi> and others, and in some places the LXX (though not in this) translate <hi>Eden,</hi> Pleasure, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Plantaverat autem Dominus Deus Paradisum voluptatis,</hi> yet undoubtedly <hi>Eden</hi> is here the proper Name of a Region, as will be more evident from <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 27. 23. <hi>Isai.</hi> 37. 12.</p>
               <p>Divers have been the Opinions of Men, and Many, even of the Learned, absurd enough, concerning the Site of this Terrestrial <hi>Paradise:</hi> Some have fancied it in the Moon, others beyond an Unnavigable Ocean, others under the Equinox; some, near the North-Pole; others, above the middle Region of the Air: But the Learned Sir <hi>Walt. Rawleigh</hi> plainly proves, God planted this Delightful Garden in <hi>Eden,</hi> (Eastward in respect of <hi>Judaea)</hi> which was afterwards called <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> where <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> joyn their Streams, and taking several Courses water <hi>Chus</hi> and <hi>Havilah</hi> according to <hi>Moses,</hi> the Seat of <hi>Chus</hi> and his Sons being then in the Valley of <hi>Shinar,</hi> where <hi>Nimrod</hi> built <hi>Babel.</hi> A Climate of all others the most temperate, 35 Degrees from the Equinoxial, and 55 from the Pole; abounding with most Excellent Wines, Fruits, Oyl, and Grain of all sorts, where, as the most perfect proof of Fertility, Palm-Trees grow in great numbers at this Day, without Care or Cultivation.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>One greater Man,</hi> the Man Christ Jesus, much greater than the Protoplast <hi>Adam,</hi> as being both God and Man, the perfect Image of his Father, who fulfill'd all Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and was made a Propitiation for us.</p>
               <p>V. 6. <hi>Sing, Heav'nly Muse:</hi> Inform me, Heavenly Muse, who didst instruct the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd <hi>Moses,</hi> who first taught the Sons of <hi>Israel,</hi> how the Heavens and Earth were made, and how this Beauteous Universe arose in such bright various Forms out of Confusion.</p>
               <p>The Poets, Ancient and Modern, in the beginning of their most Considerable Works at least, call some one, or all, the Muses to their Assistance:

The Poets tell us, when the Giants attempted Heaven, and upon Mountains piled one above another attacked the Gods, they were most of 'em so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly affrighted at the very sight of the Monstrous <hi>Briareus, Egeon</hi> and <hi>Typhon, &amp;c.</hi> that in a shameful manner they deserted, and ran down right away by the Mountain <hi>Atlas</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they transformed and hid themselves under the base sordid shapes of Beasts, and Birds, and Herbs, while <hi>Jupiter, Apollo, Bacchus,</hi> and the rest that stood to't, laid about 'em with their Thunderbolts, and at last cleared the Sky of these bold Invaders: Hence the <hi>Egyptians</hi> worshipped those mean Animals, under whose assumed shapes the Gods were supposed to have disguised themselves, in so much that they held even their Onyons Sacred, imagining some Dastard Deity might still lie stinking there for fear.

They Discoursed and Reasoned subtily and refinedly of the wonderfull, various, and unaccountable Providence of that Eternal Being, who made this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Universe, and manageth it according to the Methods of his inscrutable Will, not to be fathomed by the most discerning and enlightened Angels, much less by Minds cloathed and immersed in Clay: <hi>Providentia,</hi> Lat. of <hi>Providere,</hi> to foresee, and take care of.

               <p>Ibid. <hi>Fore-knowledge, Will and Fate;</hi> The Praescience and Fore-knowledge of God Almighty is indubitable, since he who is Omniscient must needs know and see all Things at one view, those that are past or yet to come, being only such in reference to finite Beings, but have no relation to him that is Eternal. From this Fore-knowledge, which in God is Absolute, as the next Verse affirms, the weak Apologists for Sin and Folly endeavour to draw a Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Impunity, as if whatever God foreknows will be, were by that his Fore-knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced and compelled so to come to pass, robbing at once the just Judge of all the Earth (of whom the Psalmist says, <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his Ways, and holy in all his Works, Psal.</hi> 145. <hi>v.</hi> 7.) of his Glory, and Man of his Free-will, whom <hi>God created after his Image,</hi> Gen. 1. 27. <hi>and left him in the hands of his own Counsel, Eccles.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 14. But to avoid deriving our Finite Consequences from Incomprehensible Infinitude, many things are by Men foreknown, on which nevertheless their Foreknowledge has not the least effect or shadow of Impulse, as the Rising and Setting of the Sun, the Succession of the Seasons of the Year, the various Appearances of the Moon, and the Eclipses of both those Luminaries to the end of the World, are easie to be foreknown, yet no Man will affirm, that his Foreknowledge is the cause of any of'em.</p>
               <p>V. 560. <hi>Fix'd Fate Free-Will. Omnia fato fieri,</hi> was the <hi>Dogma</hi> of the Stoicks; And <hi>Quod fore paratum est, id summum exuperat Jovem.

               <p>Ibid. <hi>First-born;</hi> Light was doubtless the first and brightest Birth of Heaven, without which even the Deity himself is inconceivable; <hi>Speak not of GOD without Light,</hi> was <hi>Plato</hi>'s saying, and what is there among all his Creatures so expressive of his Goodness, Omniscience, and Purity? <hi>Who covereth himself with Light, as with a Garment,</hi> Psal. 104. v. 3. Light, as to the Creation of this lower World, was the first of all the Creatures that had the Almighty <hi>Fiat</hi> pronounced at its Production; <hi>Then God said, Let there be Light: and there was Light.</hi> Gen. 1. 3. So our Poet, <hi>Forthwith Light Etherial, first of all Things, sprung from the Deep.</hi>

               <p>V. 2. <hi>Coeternal;</hi> Thou bright Beam, as everlasting as thy everlasting Father GOD Almighty: <hi>Coaeternus,</hi> Lat. of the same duration with Eternity.</p>
               <p>V. 3. <hi>May I express thee unblam'd,</hi> &amp;c. Blameless may I declare thee, because God himself is Light, and from Eternity in amazing brightness, disdaining all approach of Human Eyes, dwelt from Eternity, dwelt then in the, bright Emanation of the brightest Being, Eternal, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>GOD is Light;</hi> Nothing can give us a clearer Idea of the Divine Incomprehensible Being, than Light: See him described; <hi>His Brightness was as the Light,</hi> Hab. 3. v. 4. <hi>God is Light, and in him is no Darkness,</hi> 1 John 1. v. 5. <hi>Every perfect Gift cometh from the Father of Lights,</hi> Jam. 1. v. 17.</p>

Before the shining Sun, or rouling Heavens thou wert, and at the Voice of God, as with a Garment, didst array, the World arising from the Womb of Waters, gained from the empty and unfinished Deep: A noble <hi>Idea</hi> of Light,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66206:50"/>
the usefullest Ornament of the Creation, without which it had been but a sad Night-piece. Many of the Fathers, both Greek and Latin, were of opinion, that the Primitive Light created on the first Day, was the Light of the Sun imperfect and unfinished, which as it contradicts the Narrative of <hi>Moses,</hi> who tells us, That the Sun and the Moon (the two great Lights) were made on the fourth Day, so it derogates from the Majesty of the Great Maker of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, that any thing, on which his Omnipotent <hi>Fiat</hi> was pronounced, should come forth unfinished.</p>
               <p>That this first Light was not the Sun, but a shining bright Body, like a radiant Cloud mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving about the Earth, and distinguishing Day from Night, before the forming of the Sun and other Planets, is the Opinion of <hi>Bede</hi> in his <hi>Exem. Bonaventure, Nicol. de Lyra,</hi> and <hi>Tostatus,</hi> with many of the School-Divines; and of this Opinion was our Author, as at large he expresseth it, where he handles the Creation in his Seventh Book:

               <p>V. 10. <hi>As with a Mantle didst invest;</hi> As with a Glorious Mantle didst cover the dark World coming out of the deep Womb of Waters. Our Poet useth the Word <hi>Invest,</hi> B. 1. V. 208. <hi>While Night invests the Sea;</hi> there Night throws her dark Coverture o're the Waters, here Light with her glorious Garb arrays the Infant World just at its Birth, arising from the dark Deep; and the same Word does well express the Metaphor in both places. <hi>Mantle,</hi> of <hi>Manteau,</hi> Fr. of <hi>Mantelum,</hi> Lat. a Cloak.</p>

               <p>V. 17. <hi>With other Notes than to the Orphean Lyre;</hi> While pursuing my strange Subject through Hell the utter, and through the void empty Gulf, the middle Darkness, I sung of <hi>Chaos</hi> and everlasting Night, in Strains more lofty and sublime, than <hi>Orpheus</hi> ever Tuned his famous Harp to. <hi>Orpheus</hi> is reckoned the Son of <hi>Apollo</hi> and the Muse <hi>Calliope,</hi> an excellent Poet and Philosopher, as those famous ones of Antiquity were.

The next Verse, <hi>Of Natures Works to me-expung'd and ras'd,</hi> confirms, that it ought to be an <hi>Universal Blot;</hi> for <hi>Expung'd,</hi> is of <hi>Expungere,</hi> Lat. to blot out a written Word, by covering it with little Pricks or Blots, and <hi>Ras'd,</hi> is of <hi>Radere,</hi> Lat. to shave; the Romans, (who writ on Waxed Tablets with Iron Styles) when they struck out a Word, did <hi>Tabulam radere,</hi> rase it out.</p>

               <p>V. 118. <hi>Fore-knowledge had no influence;</hi> The Fore-knowledge of God does not determine the Minds of Men to good or bad Actions, thô that Fore-knowledge be infinite and infallible; nor does the commission of Good or Evil depend thereon: <hi>But he that knoweth whereof we are made, and that searcheth the Hearts, and trieth the Reins, that knows all our Thoughts afar off,</hi> clearly foresees all our Faults and Failings, which we should have committed undoubtedly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thô they had not been foreknown or foreseen by that infinite Eye.

               <p>How this lower World, and all therein, may probably enough be liable to a General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration, is easie to imagine; but how the Heavens, the Celestial Bodies, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, those bright burning Beings, which many of the Fathers, as well as Philosophers, believed to consist and be made of Fire, shall be obnoxious to it, is not so familiar to our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

St. <hi>John</hi> (who though in the Front of the <hi>Revelation</hi> he be named <hi>the Divine)</hi> is yet held to be the same who writ the Gospel called by his Name, as <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Hieronymus, Eusebius</hi> and others affirm; the difference of the style being no more, than that in the one, he has used that of a Prophet; and in the other, that of an Historian. <hi>Apocalyps,</hi>

               <p>V. 17. <hi>A Devilish Engine back recoils;</hi> Like a great Gun, that at discharging its destructive Entrails, runs back with mighty force and rude repulse; so this malicious attempt of Satan on frail Man, beats back again upon himself in hideous Horrours and distracting Doubt, of what he was, is, and must be to all Eternity. <hi>Recoils,</hi> of <hi>Reculer,</hi> Fr. to give back, to run back as a Cannon when fired.</p>

               <p>V. 20. <hi>For within him Hell he brings;</hi> Is his own Hell and Tormentor. Change of Place gives no allay or intermission to his Pains: He travels with Hell about him and within him. <hi>Coelum non Animum mutant qui trans mare currunt.</hi>

               <p>V. 40. <hi>Till Pride and worse Ambition;</hi> Pride is a kind of excessive and vicious Self-esteem, that raises Men in their own Opinions above what is just and right: But Ambition is that which adds Fewel to this Flame, and claps Spurs to these furious and inordinate Desires that break forth into the most execrable Acts to accomplish their haughty Designs; which makes our Author stigmatize Ambition as a worse Sin than Pride.</p>

               <p>From whence we are informed, that the Poets attributed to this Flower, Black, Red, and a Colour of these mixt, that of rusty Iron: But the most Judicious interpret <hi>Ferrugineus</hi> to be that Colour, which polish'd Iron, when grown cold, after having been red hot, represents, which is a sort of Violet, not well suiting with good colour'd Hair.

Vers. 28. and the Injunction <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. Vers. 17. which gave rise to that Opinion of the Fathers, that <hi>Adam</hi> was created of the Size that his Sons might arrive at about Fifty Years old, (Childhood and Youth inlarging and lessening in the times of different Longaevity;) and therefore doubtless they did not only excel all their Descendents, as the first Originals of Mankind, but as the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Image of their Maker, while they continued in glorious Innocence, which in their sinful Posterity is so defaced, that the most accomplish'd of either Sex, is but a dull dry Copy of those Master-Pieces of the Almighty.</p>

               <p>V. 348. <hi>To draw the thinner Air;</hi> 'Tis the general Opinion, that Fish breath not, because they want Lungs, the Organs in other Creatures prepared for that purpose; but whether their Gills may not supply the Office, is not determined: Certain it is, that in the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, some there are that fly about a considerable time to avoid their Persuers, and only dip to wet their Finny Wings, and get up again. Some Fish live much longer out of their Element than others; and <hi>Gesner</hi> from <hi>Albertus</hi> tells us, That Eels in a long Frost have been found bedded in a Haycock adjoyning to a River lusty and lively, and that an Eel has in warm Weather lived 5 days out of the Water. Our Author therefore does not affirm Fish not to breath, but that they cannot draw our Air more thin and subtle than that embodied with Water, for if Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers be quite frozen up, the Fish die for want of it.</p>

               <p>V. 355. <hi>But in these I found not what I wanted;</hi> As it is related in the Holy Leaf, That after <hi>Adam</hi> had given Names to every Beast of the Field, to the Fowl of the Air, and to all Cattel, <hi>But for Adam there was not found a help meet for him,</hi> Gen. 2. 20. Four Reasons are alledged, why God brought these living Creatures to be Named by him: That he might see how much he excelled them, made of more Noble Frame, and to more Noble Ends: That they might pay him Fealty as their Lord: That he might enlarge his Language by so many Words: And that seeing each of 'em in his kind Paired and Mated, he might desire of his Maker a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

For had Man continued Sinless, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable how the World could have maintained, if able to contain, their vast Multitudes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways here below. Therefore <hi>Immortality</hi> imports a <hi>Longevity</hi> of undisturb'd Happiness, and undistemper'd Health, which should have transmitted Mankind into Heaven at God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time. But having lost his Happiness, which depended on his Innocence, Immortality would have proved a Punishment, an everlasting Disease, whose only Remedy and Cure is Death, the Restorative of his Primitive State, and Eternal Bliss. Hence that of St. <hi>Paul, To die is great gain,</hi> Phil. 1. 21.

That the <hi>Rainbow</hi> was seen in the Clouds often before the Deluge, is not to be doubted, because its Natural Causes were then in being, the Sun shining on opposite Clouds: But <hi>God</hi> made choice of it for a sign of his <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Noah</hi> and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritp, it being naturally the most fit and proper, as the Token of decreasing Rain, as never to be seen but when the Clouds are thin, and the chearful Sun shines on them; as <hi>Vallesius</hi> has well observed, <hi>c.</hi> 9. Those that suppose the <hi>Rainbow</hi> was, at God's Covenant with <hi>Noah,</hi> first set in the Clouds, are forc'd to believe, that till the 600 years of his Life, God had not caused it to rain on the Earth, but water'd it with Mists, or by overflowing of Rivers, as <hi>Egypt</hi> by the <hi>Nile,</hi> otherwise it must have been there before.

               <p>V. 290. <hi>Law can discover Sin. Sin by the Commandment, becoming exceeding Sinful.</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 13. (was to be expiated by the Sacrifices of Bulls and Goats, according to the <hi>Mosaic Institution,</hi> under the Law: <hi>So that without shedding of Blood there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> Heb. 9. 22. These <hi>Types and weak Shadows of Expiation,</hi> and Pardon, were to inform Mankind of some Sacrifice of more absolute Satisfaction, of the <hi>Just for the Unjust, Jesus Christ, who not by the Blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own Blood enter'd once into the holy place, having obtained Eternal Redemption for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 12. <hi>Expiatio,</hi> Lat. a cleansing by Sacrifice, thence Pardon.</p>
               <p>V. 295. <hi>To them by Faith imputed;</hi> That Christ Righteousness and Satisfaction being by Faith made and reckon'd as their own, <hi>&amp;c. By the Righteousness of one, came the Free-Gift upon all Men,</hi> unto Justification of Life, <hi>by the Obedience of one shall many be made Righteous,</hi> Rom. 5. 18, and 19. <hi>Therefore being justified by Faith, we have Peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> v. 1.</p>
               <p>V. 298. <hi>Nor Man the Moral part perform:</hi> No Man is able to keep God's Commandments, call'd the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> or <hi>Moral Law: Therefore by the Deeds of the Law, there shall no Flesh be justified in his sight,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. <hi>From which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses,</hi> Act. 13. 39. <hi>Moralis,</hi> Lat. appertaining to Manners.</p>
               <p>V. 300. <hi>So Law appears imperfect; for the Law made nothing perfect,</hi> Heb. 7. 19.</p>
               <p>V. 303. <hi>From Shadowy Types to Truth;</hi> From the <hi>Types and Shadows</hi> of the Legal Sacrifices, to Christs real Satisfaction, <hi>From the Law having a shadow of good things to come,</hi> Heb. 10. 1. To Grace given by <hi>Jesus, who fulfill'd all Righteousness,</hi> Matth. 3. 15.</p>
               <p>V. 305. <hi>To free acceptance of large Grace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Much more the Grace of God, and the Gift by Grace, by one Man, Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many. The Freegift is of many Offences untó Justification,</hi> Rom. 5. 15, and 16.</p>
               <p>V. 306. <hi>Works of Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By what Law? of Works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 27.</p>
               <p>V. 307. <hi>Shall not Moses lead his People into Canaan. Moses</hi> Died in Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> from whence he had the prospect of the Promised Land, but not the honour of leading the Israelites in to possess it, which was reserved for <hi>Joshuah,</hi>
