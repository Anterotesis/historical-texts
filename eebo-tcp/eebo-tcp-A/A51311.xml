            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to be, an entire <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
upon the whole Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> yet I
hope it will prove what the Title promises, A

<hi>the several</hi> Prophecies or Divine Visions of
<hi>Daniel,</hi> wherein the affairs of the Church of
God whether Iewish or Christian are prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or predicted, which indeed is as much as
to say, upon <hi>all</hi> the Prophecies or Divine Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of <hi>Daniel.</hi> For those two Visions which
I have omitted, That touching the <hi>Tree,</hi>
Chap. 4. to be hewn down by the decree of
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:59418:3"/>
the Watchers and the demand of the Holy
Ones, and that other, Chap. 5. of the <hi>Hand</hi>
seen <hi>writing</hi> upon the wall, neither of those
are the Visions of <hi>Daniel,</hi> but the former the
Dream of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the latter a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which <hi>Belshazzar</hi> saw, namely, The shape
of a mans hand writing on the wall. Nor were
these predictions of the State of the Church,
but of the particular State of those two Kings
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> So that I did not avoid them for any more

for it is far less; but merely because
they were not sutable to my scope. The stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest

into an Oxe. But that is a mere abuse
both of the Text and of him. That by the just

of an Oxe or Bull, and in this wild

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> And as for that Vision of the Hand seen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the wall,<note place="margin">Of the Hand seen writing on the wall by Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, and of the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers, &amp;c. being not able to read it.</note> the most puzling thing in
that whole story is, that all the Chaldeans,
Soothsayers and Astrologers, all the wise men
of King <hi>Belshazzar</hi> should prove themselves
such fools, as to be puzled in the reading three
or four words writ in their own language, For
the words are Chaldee. This I confess Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
make a great pudder about, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to loose the knot various ways. Some
say, they could not read it because though the
words were <hi>Chaldee,</hi> yet they were writ in the
old <hi>Hebrew,</hi> i.e. <hi>Samaritan</hi> Character. Others
that the Characters though they were Chaldee,
yet were transposed. Others that onely the Initial
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:59418:4"/>
letters were writ, and so they could make no
words of them. And others that they being
writ without points, they did not know how to
point them or vowel them. And lastly there
are others that conceive that God miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
blinded or rather dazled their sight, and
confounded their perception, that he might
reserve the credit of that exploit for <hi>Daniel.</hi>
But it being such a night of profane revelling
and feasting, why might not the wise men part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of tipsiness, and partly out of consternation
of mind, in sympathizing with their perplexed
Prince and his Court, be so maskard that they
could not read the hand-writing on the Wall, it
being writ also on purpose by the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi>
(for the Iews make him the Scribe) so scribledly
as I may so say, and brokenly, that though a
man of a pacate mind and quick understanding
would easily read it, yet men so much gone in
drink, and drunk also with horrour and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
would not be able to make any thing
of it.</p>
            <p>And yet there is a more simple and easy
solution than all these. In Chap. 4. vers. 9.
<hi>Tell me,</hi> says <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to <hi>Daniel,
the Visions of my dream that I have seen
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:59418:5"/>
and the Interpretation thereof.</hi> Where the
particle ו [And] most assuredly signifies as
much as [that is to say.] For <hi>Daniel</hi> was not
to tell the dream but the Interpretation of it.
So that the true and plain sense of that part
of that Verse is, <hi>Tell me the Visions of my
dream that I have seen, that is to say,
the Interpretation thereof.</hi> In like manner
Chap. 5. vers. 8. where it is said, <hi>The wise
men could not read the writing,</hi> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
following which is [ו] and which our
English Translation renders [Nor] in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
of the negation preceding (otherwise it
naturally signifies [And]) may as well be
rendred [that is to say] as [Nor] And
then the sense is plain and easy. <hi>The Kings
wise men could not read the writing,
that is to say, they could not make
known to the King the Interpretation
thereof,</hi> they could not read it so asto inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
it to him. For though the hand-writing
was not mere <hi>Initial</hi> letters, yet they were such
single incoherent words without any syntax,
that none could tell what they meant but he
that writ them, who haply assisted <hi>Daniel</hi> in

Whenas the Appearance of an
Hand, while it writ upon the wall, was most
certainly a real Appearance to <hi>Belshazzar,</hi>
and not a mere fancy of his own, it having so
violent an effect upon him, that it loosened
the ligaments of his loins, <hi>compages renum,</hi>
as the Latin has it, so that for very fear his
urine came from him, as <hi>Grotius</hi> comments
upon the place. The Agony that the Apparition
put him into, it seems was so great that it
weakened his <gap reason="foreign">

it is expressed in the<note n="*" place="margin">Ezech. 7. 17. Ch. 21. 7.</note> Prophets, nay
made both his knees knock one against another
from the violence of his trembling and fear.
Besides, that it was no fancy, the Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the wall was an indubitable testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
it being permanent and visible to
all.</p>
            <p>The other Observable concerns those high

of themselves, as if it were below them to
be moved by any Prophetical Interpretation
that is analyzed into <hi>Paronomastical</hi> Allusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Whenas <hi>Maimonides,</hi> in the above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

What greater or more Authentick te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
for this way of interpreting can be

            <p>This little excursion, which I have made,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
almost unawares,<note place="margin">Why the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour did not undertake the whole Exposition of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </note> touching these two Visions
that are not properly the visions of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
but the one of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the other
of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> his grandchild, will I hope
satisfie the Reader, if my preterition of them,
in my <hi>Exposition</hi> of <hi>Daniels</hi> Visions, may
seem any Defect, and make some compensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for my omitting them, I having thus cleared
by the bye the most considerable things in them.
But to have undertaken the whole Book of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
it would have taken more time, and
swelled the volume into a greater bulk and
price than would be ordinarily convenient, and
delayed the publishing of it, and made it less
effectual for the main design, which is the
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:59418:8"/>
most speedy and expedite succouring of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion, which the Agents of <hi>Rome</hi>
lay such strong battery against, and by all
means possible seek to undermine. Wherefore
I conceived that my <hi>Exposition</hi> would prove
the more effectual for that end, the less it had
of any thing but what tended thereto. And
yet I would not be so sparing and precise as
not to take in <hi>all</hi> the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi>
that concern the State of the Church of God,
whether <hi>Jewish</hi> or <hi>Christian;</hi> even <hi>all</hi> those
<hi>entire</hi> Visions in which these affairs are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,

so far as I have attempted,<note place="margin">Why he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Prophetical parts.</note> I thought it not
improper to undertake, forasmuch as in all
likelyhood it might prove an easier Province
to me, than to another man, and be more
speedily and more successfully administred by
me; both because I have so throughly from
the beginning to the end considered the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,
which is a more full Commentary upon
those parts of the Visions of <hi>Daniel</hi> which fall

<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:59418:8"/>
(whence they will wonderfully illustrate

my <hi>Mystery of Godliness</hi> and <hi>Mystery of

of <hi>Daniel</hi> already, as that of the <hi>Seventy
Weeks,</hi> and of the <hi>King of Pride,</hi> and others.
One good use of which my Performance, I hope,
will be, that when men see so palpable a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
betwixt the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
they will be steared off from conceiving
any such sense in any passages of <hi>Daniel</hi> as
may be inconsistent with the genuine meaning
of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> Which was one reason
amongst the rest that invited me to this
task.</p>
            <p>But now for the <hi>Performance</hi> of the <hi>Task</hi>

itself,<note place="margin">What the manner and nature of his performance therein, And how grosly <hi>Calvin</hi> is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting <hi>Daniel</hi> in those parts of the Visions that fall in with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse.</hi>
               </note> the manner and nature thereof, it is
muchwhat like that of my <hi>Apocalypsis Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypseos,</hi>
an <hi>Exposition</hi> homogeneous and
coherent, and as it were of one thread,
though I have been here and there ever
and anon assisted by several Interpreters, such
as <hi>Cornelius à Lapide, Gaspar Sanctius,
John Calvin, Hugo Grotius</hi> and <hi>Joseph
Mede,</hi> the two first of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:59418:9"/>
and high Papists, the third as high an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papist,
the fourth a <hi>Cassandrian</hi> Protestant,
and the fifth a sound Christian, and the glory
indeed of our English Church. Something out
of all these Authours, besides what is spun of
mine own, makes one continued Contexture
and closely coherent Exposition of these six
Visions or Prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which I have
undertaken to Interpret.</p>
            <p>But as for those parts of any of the Visions
which synchronize with the Times of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie</hi>
of the Church, or the duration of the
<hi>Beast</hi> with <hi>ten Horns,</hi> as I had least need of
it (the understanding the Apocalypse being
a sufficient key for the opening those parts of
the Visions) so I had least help from either
<hi>Cornelius à Lapide, Gaspar Sanctius, Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
or <hi>Calvin</hi> himself, who is more out in
his Interpretation of those parts of the Visions
touching the <hi>little Horn</hi> rising amongst the
<hi>ten Horns,</hi> and the <hi>King of Pride,</hi> than those
two Iesuits who with the ancient Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously
confess, that Antichrist is prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in those parts of the Visions, though they
with the ancient Fathers rest in ignorance who
this Antichrist is. But <hi>Calvin</hi> not allowing
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:59418:9"/>
so much as that they are Predictions of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
but bounding the Vision in the seventh
Chapter, and also that in the eleventh, upon
the first coming of Christ, and interpreting
things concerning the <hi>Pagan Roman</hi> Empire,
his Expositions are so childishly argute and
whisling, so dilute, shallow and slubbering, so
preposterous, forced and confused, and so devoid
of that strength and nervosity he shews in other
things where he is unprejudiced (nor is it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
I dare say here, for he holds expresly
and zealously that the Pope is Antichrist, but
mere defect of skill and judgment) that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
is not at all like <hi>Calvin</hi> in this performance.
And no wonder, he venturing to interpret those
parts of the Visions which are not to be unlock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without the key of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which
he neglected to get the understanding of, or
despaired ever to attain to the understanding
of it, by reason of the seeming obscurity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And I wish there were not so many in the
Reformed Churches that in this point <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize</hi>
also, as there are.</p>
            <p>But yet to give him his due he is much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>
more tolerable than <hi>Grotius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">That yet <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> is far more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and in what regard.</note> forasmuch as he

Horns to be the Roman Empire, though he
does not improve that light to the due advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
he might. But <hi>Grotius</hi> on the other side,
was so nasute on the behalf of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that foreseeing if the fourth Beast
were the Roman Empire, it would infallibly
fall to the share of the <hi>Pope</hi> to be the <hi>little
Horn</hi> with eyes and a mouth speaking great
things, that is to say, to be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> he to
befriend the Papacy denies, against the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of all Antiquity, and against the Roman

is the Roman Empire, but that it is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> having

to the week in which Christ suffered, as
well as to that in which the City was taken by
<hi>Titus</hi> and Temple demolished; I say, though
he hath shewn good learning and skill in the

a Labyrinth, and seeming not so easy and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
a sense of things, I have declined this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
excellent Interpreter, in this point,
and have taken the Epocha of <hi>Thomas Lydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,</hi>
that other singular ornament of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Church, namely the twentieth of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes

opened his chief arguments for that <hi>Epocha.</hi>
And therefore this way being most simple, plain
and natural, I preferred it before what was
more operose, intricate and labyrinthical. And
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:59418:11"/>
I believe Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s main confidence in his
own Interpretation as to these Epocha's, was
this, in that he followed the footsteps of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph
Scaliger</hi> in the main, (of whom through

            <p>I must confess <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> took another

our case, which I conceive to be quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Forasmuch as those parties I so often

besides Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> being of a different persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

the greater argument to the Reader that those

could bear and of the Devils they could bear,

            <p>And it were worth the while for them that
have so slight a conceit or great abhorrence

search into the condition of their own souls
whether their unholy and insincere nature
makes not the converse with these two holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

to conclude things far more hard and

of the Flesh, and so seem to shuffle with God

But he was tampering with the King of <hi>Assyria</hi>

and not to be distracted by new Appearances,
he did what he could to winde himself off from
any <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>supernatural</hi> Direction, as all

And this is the usual case of those that pretend

it is no fault of the Prophecies themselves,
but that they are not duly qualified that read
them. For, as, that the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible

touching the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> those parts

that after such a time, namely the expiration
of one thousand two hundred and ninety Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
days,<note place="margin">Dan. Ch. 12. ver. 10.</note> which are so many years from the

in order to the discerning and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in the midst of this full light they phansie

<hi>Dan. Ch.</hi> 12. 10. Which is no small argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>utility</hi> if not <hi>necessity</hi> of studying

Interpreters of them, the rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of them being amongst other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
no obscure mark of our being sound,

            <p>Which I would have those seriously to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
who (though they would take themselves
much injured if they were not numbred amongst

ignorance of the meaning of the Prophecies of
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:59418:16"/>
               <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> that they cannot
forbear the declaring of it in their publick wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
as if it were forsooth such a special per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of nature or Gift of the Holy Ghost,
not to be able to understand those Prophecies.
Whenas the Holy Ghost himself does declare
those blessed that understand them, and that
the wicked shall not understand them, but that
the wise shall understand them. Whence we
may note a further ignorance in these men
more than they are aware of, or willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg.
They seem ignorant or insensible
that they, thus publickly and boastfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
their ignorance in these Prophecies, do
but glory in their own shame, and basely and
shamefully beg the applause and approbation
of the Wits of the age, and the worldly Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
who for coarse carnal ends decry all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

thus out of a fond and light ambitious desire
of being entred into the list of the <hi>Wits</hi> of

of the Christian, the largeness of the Christian

and needfull beneficency directed him, and
limited him; so likewise the same Christ has
behaved himself in like manner in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of these Prophecies. Wherein there
is not the least shew of affectation of foretelling
future things as future, but merely as they are
in subserviency to the most certain information
of his Church, whether Iewish or Christian,
concerning their own state and condition, what
it would be. This is more largely insisted upon,
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:59418:18"/>
if the Prophecies be rightly understood; but
the <hi>Pagan</hi> Concerns more sparingly, and in
subordination onely to the affairs of the Church,
which is a thing methinks very gracefull and

of these Prophecies. And this shall briefly

would make too great a rattle or noise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse
the names of them, you may see them in

that <hi>was, is not, and yet is, Apoc.</hi> 17. are

says of this last, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Beast that is said
to ascend out of the bottomless pit,</hi> that
<hi>Antichrist</hi> ascends with him, and that the
other Beast, Chap. 13. with <hi>ten Horns</hi> is <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi>
from the authority of the Fathers,
and the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast his Armour-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
or Squire of his body, though more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast is to be called
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> and the <hi>ten-horned</hi> his Squire,
(I wish he had had a better office and not been
debased to so mean and unbecoming a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
by the Imposture of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast)
I say it being according to the common stream
of Antiquity and Interpreters, that those times
of the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast are the times of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi>
and the same being founded mainly
upon that which is unexceptionably sound, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the times of these <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Beasts,

consent declare to be the formidable <hi>Antichrist</hi>

synchronize, or are the very same times, and
both necessarily conceived in the latter time
of the Roman Empire; <hi>Grotius</hi> discerning
that unless <hi>Porphyrius</hi> his opinion may be

perceive that the Papistical notion and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
touching <hi>Antichrist</hi> is such a Romance,
so incredible and ridiculous (you may have
it pretty well at large in <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi>

of such a childish story, occasioned first
from the ignorance of the Prophetick style, but
entertained afterwards by the Roman Clergy
to save the credit of the <hi>Pope</hi> from being sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to be the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> it is worth our
noting that he had no way left to doe them a
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:59418:21"/>
more solid piece of service, or to offer them any
plausibler pretence, That the <hi>Pope</hi> may not be
thought to be the <hi>little Horn with eyes</hi>
(which all Christian Antiquity with one voice
declare to be the <hi>Antichrist)</hi> than by espousing
the opinion of <hi>Porphyry,</hi> that the <hi>fourth</hi>
Kingdome in <hi>Daniel</hi> is not the <hi>Roman,</hi> and
therefore the little Horn not the Papacy nor
the Pope Antichrist. For <hi>Grotius</hi> was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a person of so much Wit and Iudgment as
clearly to discern that that wooden conceit of
<hi>Mahomet</hi>'s being the little Horn with eyes,
and consequently the Antichrist, was altogether
impossible. That was such a blockish device,
or rather such a stumbling-block, that so sober
a man as he would never break his shins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; it being a thing absurd at the very
first sight. For it is plain out of the Text that
the little Horn is an Horn growing up amongst
the Horns of the fourth Kingdome, which is the
fourth Beast, and therefore it is an Horn of
that Beast or Kingdome, not of the Kingdome
of the <hi>Saracens</hi> or <hi>Turks.</hi> Otherwise there
would have been mentioned another Beast to
which this Horn should belong. But there being
no mention of another besides this fourth, which
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:59418:21"/>
I say, is the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, nor does <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
allow it to be the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that this little Horn be an Horn
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, not <hi>Mahomet</hi> nor
any Horn of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Kingdome. And
therefore accordingly, Ch. 7. ver. 20. the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ten Horns are called his <hi>fellows</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
all to one and the same Polity the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and as being all political<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conjoyned or <hi>consociated</hi> into one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
as the words in the Original imply, which
no <hi>Saracenical</hi> or <hi>Turkish</hi> Horn is with the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire thus divided into ten King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
This could not but lye obvious to the
sight of so perspicacious a person as <hi>Grotius,</hi>
besides the unapplicableness of the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the little Horn to the <hi>Mahometan</hi>
Empire which it would be too long to insist
upon.</p>
            <p>I will onely add one notable bar more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this conceit of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s being the
little Horn with eyes, <hi>viz.</hi> That what the
<hi>Clay</hi> is to the <hi>Iron feet</hi> and <hi>ten toes</hi> of the
Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> Ch. 2. what the <hi>King of Pride</hi>
is to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>Dan.</hi> Ch. 11.
what the <hi>two-horned Beast</hi> is to the <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:59418:22"/>
               <hi>horned Beast,</hi> Apoc. Ch. 13. what the <hi>Whore</hi>
is to the <hi>Beast that was, is not, and yet is,</hi>
Apoc. Ch. 17. the same is the <hi>little Horn
with eyes</hi> to the <hi>Beast with ten Horns,</hi>
Dan. Ch. 7. So that if the Horn with eyes be
<hi>Mahomet</hi> or the Turk; the <hi>Clay,</hi> the <hi>King
of Pride,</hi> the <hi>two-horned Beast,</hi> and the
<hi>Whore</hi> must be the <hi>Turk</hi> also. This he that
understands the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the
<hi>Apocalypse</hi> throughly is certainly assured of,
and consequently as certain that neither <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
nor any <hi>Turkish</hi> Polity is that <hi>little
Horn with eyes,</hi> Dan. Ch. 7. But what was so
very obvious you may be sure turned <hi>Grotius</hi>
his stomach sufficiently from so fond and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loùs
a conceit. See my <hi>Synopsis Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
Book 2. Ch. 5. Consect. 9. where it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
demonstrated, <hi>That the Whore of</hi>
Babylon <hi>or</hi> Antichrist <hi>sits not now at</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,
<hi>but that old</hi> Rome <hi>is his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Seat.</hi> Wherefore it is plain, That <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
shewed a great deal of Iudgment in
not adventuring to let the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
be the fourth Beast, and so to pretend that
<hi>Mahomet</hi> is the little Horn or Antichrist, it
being a thing so absurd and impossible. And
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:59418:22"/>
therefore to give a stop to this grand inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
that the <hi>Turk</hi> not proving the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi>
or <hi>little Horn</hi> the Pope would be sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he, he was forced to deny that the <hi>fourth</hi>
Empire was the <hi>Roman,</hi> thinking that less
absurd, than that <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Pontifician
Antichrist</hi> or that <hi>Mahomet</hi> should be he.
Whence it plainly appears of what great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is to be assured of this ancient Truth
of the Church, that the fourth Kingdome in
<hi>Daniel</hi> is the <hi>Roman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which made me therefore though I have
competently well confuted <hi>Grotius,</hi> or made
good that the <hi>fourth</hi> Kingdome is the <hi>Roman</hi>

persuasion and impression of so concerning a
truth upon the mind of the Reader, to add this
first part of my Appendage, namely a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Confutation of that opinion of <hi>Grotius.</hi>
Which being found so weak and impossible as
I have demonstrated, and this fable of the
Romanists so foolish and ridiculous as well
as that of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s being Antichrist, or the
little Horn, even in <hi>Grotius</hi> his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:59418:23"/>
with the greater strength against the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
to prove that the Pope is Antichrist, he,
methinks, thus plainly insinuating, that if
this conceit of his and <hi>Porphyrius</hi> his will
not hold, the Pope will be Antichrist and no
mortal man knows how to help it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> Wherefore none ought to take amiss my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in making good this point.<note place="margin">The great importance of proving the fourth Kingdome in <hi>Daniel</hi> to be the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> for making good the opinion of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers that the times of the <hi>little Horn with eyes</hi> are the times of <hi>Antichrist</hi> &amp;c. and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Times of <hi>Antichrist</hi> the Times of the <hi>Papacy.</hi>
               </note> Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the <hi>fourth</hi> Kingdome in <hi>Daniel</hi> its
being the <hi>Roman,</hi> is a necessary foundation
of the ancient Fathers interpreting the little
Horn with eyes, <hi>Dan. Ch.</hi> 7. <hi>the King of
Pride, Ch.</hi> 11. <hi>the Man of sin,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. the
ten-horned Beast and the two-horned Beast,
<hi>Apoc.</hi> Ch. 13. and the Beast arising out of the
bottomless pit, Ch. 17. of the times of Antichrist.
And if this foundation stand, as it is most sure,
the Interpretation of the Fathers, so far in
general, as that those Prophecies concern the
times of Antichrist, must stand also. But
now by undeniable demonstration in my <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypsis
Apocalypseos,</hi> and in my <hi>Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
Prophetica,</hi> I have proved that those times
which the ancient Fathers declare to be the
times of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> are in reality the times of
the <hi>Papacy.</hi> Whence it necessarily follows,
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:59418:23"/>
That the times of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> if we stand to
this verdict of the Fathers, are the times of
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> and that it is not a piece of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
or reproachful language but a just and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
charge laid upon the <hi>Pope</hi> with his Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
by the Reformed party, that he is that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Antichrist</hi> which the ancient Christians, in
the very Apostles time, so much dreaded that
he would come.</p>
            <p>Which Rumour and Fear most certainly was
raised from the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and more
especially from that of the King of Pride, which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the man of sin, and from the
little Horn with eyes. Which <hi>false Seer</hi> or
<hi>Pseudo-prophet,</hi> as also that <hi>King of Pride,</hi>
is, by St. <hi>John</hi> according to the vulgarly known
name then in the Church, called <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
Touching whom they which he wrote to in his
Epistles, being solicitous, he acknowledges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that <hi>grand Antichrist</hi> to come that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
foretells of, but in the mean time warns
them of such <hi>Antichrists, false Seers</hi> or
<hi>Pseudo-prophets</hi> as were more near and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

them characters of them to shun them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very wretched and mischievous Antichrists

in their time and place, as well as that other
to come. So authentick a name is that name
of <hi>Antichrist</hi> for that Party and Polity that
should prove the <hi>little Horn with eyes,</hi> the

of the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that, when he
did come, he would prove horribly bad, as

him, his tyranny and salvage cruelty against
them being unutterable, as the monstrosity of
his doctrines and gross enormities in practice
a thing beyond all conceit of any of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick

<pb n="li" facs="tcp:59418:26"/>
orderly comprehension of things. But sundry
being not aware that the Vials, all of them
follow the Rising of the Witnesses, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that the Witnesses are risen already in
the late Blessed Reformation, busy themselves
in the inventing new <hi>Epocha</hi>'s of the <hi>Medial</hi>
or <hi>Antemedial</hi> Synchronals to fit themselves
for the foretelling (out of an itch of Prophecying
or prognosticating things future) when that will
come, that is already past, as I have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
the Rising of the Witnesses to be, in
this second part of my <hi>Appendage.</hi> And they
that have applied the late Blessed Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the second Vial, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him <hi>Peganius</hi> has done, it was from this
errour, that they took it for granted that most
of the Vials preceeded the Rising of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
And such is the humour, fansifulness
and partiality of many, that they can hardly
believe of themselves, that the Witnesses are
risen, till Kingdomes, Nations, and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
of their own party rise into Political
power, namely all <hi>Episcopal,</hi> all <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
all <hi>Calvinists,</hi> all <hi>Arminians,</hi> all <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
and so of <hi>Anabaptists, Quakers</hi> and
<hi>Famulists.</hi> But they erre knowing not the
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:59418:27"/>
Scriptures or the true meaning of them, nor
rightly considering the Records of History,
where they may find what was the testimony
of these Witnesses who are predicted to rise
in the Reformation, and to be warred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/> As there was nothing to alledge against
the Apostolicalness of their faith,<note place="margin">The main Testimony of the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses what it was, and that there was a Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of these Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in the Reformation.</note> they profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Triunity of the Godhead and Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Christ, and such like Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
belief, and living accordingly, whereby
they became idoneous, Witnesses; so their
plain and simple testimony against the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> was this, That the Pope was that
Man of sin or Antichrist, and their Church
Idolatrous by reason of their adoration of the
Host, invocation of Saints and worshipping of
Images, and their Religion otherwise also gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
corrupt in seeking to propitiate God by their
adhering to the multifarious vain and wicked
inventions of men, excogitated onely for the
gain of the Priest and the keeping the people
in blindness and ignorance. This was the
tenour of the Testimony of the Witnesses both
in the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and the <hi>Thyatirian</hi>
               <pb n="liii" facs="tcp:59418:27"/>
Interval of the Church, which they witnessed
with great <hi>favouriness</hi> and <hi>assurance,</hi> in
virtue of the Spirit of life and holiness in
them: And persons innumerable that bore the
same testimony and were of the same sentiments,
instead of being still mournfull Witnesses in
sackcloth, or lying dead in a Political sense
in the streets of the Mystical Prophet-murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> (the same with <hi>Babylon</hi> or
<hi>Aegypt</hi> which signify the large jurisdiction of
the Pope of <hi>Rome)</hi> at the Reformation had
a reviving into Political Power again, and
ascended, in several Kingdomes, to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Honours, Dignities and Employments in
Church and State. Which therefore as I have
proved in this part of my <hi>Appendage</hi> must
needs be <hi>the Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> they
being of the same mind and profession with
those that were so grievously persecuted and
kept out of all power, nay burnt at the stake,
murdered and massacred God knows how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred thousands of them.</p>
            <p>And at this very day our own Church of
<hi>England,</hi> partly in her <hi>Homilies,</hi> partly in
her <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Liturgy</hi> gives the same te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> even that she
<pb n="liv" facs="tcp:59418:28"/>
is that old painted harlot of <hi>Babylon</hi> with
her cup of fornication, that is, of Idolatry,
and that the Pope is Antichrist, as I have
shewn in my <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> Book 2.
Ch. 21. Which, whenas our own Church, which
seems most moderate, does so plainly attest,
we may be sure the rest of the chiefest writers
of the Reformation do not mince the matter at
all. And if there be any persons in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
any where that at all recoyl from this
testimony, it is because the Spirit of life and
holiness is decayed in them, and the gross
Spirit of this world has blinded their eyes and
darkened their understandings, and hardened
their hearts against the truth, they preferring
worldly power, pomp and riches before the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Gods worship. Wherefore, I say, this
is one great usefulness of my demonstrating
the <hi>Vials to follow the Rising of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
in that it is thence manifest, that the
Vision of the Rising of the Witnesses was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in the late Blessed Reformation, there
being thus no other Vision to predict it but
this.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVII"/> Which conclusion contains a manifold use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness

Heaven upon the Rising of the Witnesses, <hi>That
the Kingdomes of the world were become
the Kingdomes of the Lord and of his
Christ,</hi> namely after so many Principalities,
Provinces and Kingdomes had cast off the Pope
in the late Blessed Reformation, what does
this imply but that they were before in the
hands of Antichrist, and that were the Pope
has any Dominion it is <hi>ipso facto</hi> Antichrists
Kingdome, and on the contrary that all the
Reformed parts of Christendome are the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ, and indeed the fifth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
begun. Which ought to stop the mouths
and carrears of an ignorant and Fanatical sort
of men that cannot see wood for trees, and seek
for a fifth Monarchy in a fifth Monarchy,
whenas so considerable a part of it is erected
before their eyes already. But as I noted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
such is the folly and freakishness of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and conceited men, that they would
not willingly acknowledge the Witnesses to be
risen till those of the same crotchets with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
(whole Kingdomes and Nations of them)
have got into power.</p>
            <p>But it is very true and extremely worth

good use and moment that we be assured of
this truth for these two main reasons especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
First that it appearing so plainly, That the
Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> stands for the Reformed
Churches, as they are called, we may look our
selves in that glass and see our spots and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
therein, to amend them. For that we
are signified by that Church even they do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
who otherwise differ something from
me in the determining the Seven Intervals of
these Churches (but have declared, as I find,
long before me, that this Vision of the Seven
Churches is a Prophecy of the State of
the Church to the end of the World)
while they expresly deliver that the <hi>Sardian</hi>
Period as they call it, is the Period of the
Reformed Churches commencing from <hi>Luther</hi>
and <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Balthasar
Willius</hi> a sober and learned German Doctor

in his Commentary on the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi>
(and indeed he is so well assured of the truth
of the Vision of the Seven Churches being a
Prophecy of the Church from the beginning
thereof to the end of the world, that he makes
it the Basis of a special part of his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary)

               </note> Where Christ
tells the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church, that is, the Reformed
Churches, that they have a name that they
live, because they have zeal and heat, which
seems to be a symptome of life, but it is not
for the true indispensable Christian life but for
or against this opinion or that ceremony,
whenas they are cold at the heart to what is
the onely life of a Christian, Humility, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Charity. To which they are either dead
or in a profound sopor. Whence Christ says to
them <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,<note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 2.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the behalf of

out of this deep sleep or lethargy, and
keep they self awake and strengthen the things
that are ready to dye, that is, Faith in God and
Christ and of a life to come. For it is horrid
to consider how far Atheism, Vnbelief, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curisme
has spread itself even amongst the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches themselves, these monsters
having grown upon us as our zeal has relaxated
against the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For to such all
Religions are alike, if the worst be not the
<pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:59418:35"/>
most eligible, with them especially of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
it serving best for the pride, power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of a corrupt Priesthood.</p>
            <p>But Christ bids them <hi>remember how they
have received and heard,</hi> from the ancient
Prophets and Apostles, and from the late
<hi>Witnesses</hi> to the truth, as by whom they were
expresly informed that the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
was the great <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and his Church a
Synagogue of <hi>Idolaters.</hi> That the Popedome
is Antichrists Kingdome, and consequently for
one to forsake the Reformed Religion and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himself to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is little
better in <hi>foro Divino</hi> than rebellion and
treachery against the Kingdome of Christ.
Wherefore says Christ to the Church in <hi>Sardis,
Hold fast</hi> and be no revolters, but renew
and resume your ancient zeal for the Purity of
Gods worship and the Power of Godliness, your
ancient Iealousy for the honour of God against
Idols and Image-worship and other kinds of
Idolatry and Heathen-like Superstitions, your
horrour and detestation of all Debauchery and
Scandal of life, lest he whose eyes are more
pure than to behold Iniquity, loath you and
turn off from you on a suddain, and leave you
<pb n="lxx" facs="tcp:59418:36"/>
to be a prey to your insulting enemies. So that
here is Commination of misery enough to the
Reformed Churches unless they repent, without
recourse to the slaying of the Witnesses, the
fulfilling of which Prophecy is already past.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVI"/> But in the mean time it is apparent enough
from this first consideration,<note place="margin">The second reason why he added the third part of his Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <hi>viz.</hi> For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription sake of the <hi>Philadelphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Interval which is to succeed the <hi>Sardian.</hi>
               </note> namely the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of the Epistle to the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church
for the representing the defects and corruptions
of the Reformed Churches to their view, that
I had reason why I should be solicitous to
make good that the Vision of the Seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
is a Prophecy of the state of so many Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of the Church from the beginning thereof
to the end of the World. And the other main
reason is the description of the state of the
succeeding Interval of the Church in Christs
Epistle to the Church in <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which glorious Character is exposed to the
view of the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church as a <hi>Pharos</hi> to
mariners on a dangerous Sea in a dark night,
that they may know towards what to make to,
and that the Reformed Churches may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that Christ intends such a state of his
Church upon earth, at the next turn, as shall
be <hi>without either spot or wrinkle or any
<pb n="lxxi" facs="tcp:59418:36"/>
such thing, but that it shall be holy and
without blemish.</hi> For for this very cause did
he yield himself to the death of the cross, as you
may see, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 25. But of the <hi>Sardian</hi>
Church it is said expresly, that her <hi>works are
not found perfect before God,</hi> Apoc. 3. 2.
And for this reason certainly, most especially
are they not found perfect, because they are
not done in charity, according to that precept
of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 16. 14. <hi>Let all your
things be done in charity,</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
elsewhere calls the bond of perfectness, and
is indeed perfectness itself, without which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is right nor perfect, nor can well hold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
This is the thing that is especially
wanting in the Reformed Churches, and is the
very Title and Inscription of the next Interval
of the Church, which is the Church of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi>
The Church of Holy Love or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
For that Church will count every son
of <hi>Adam</hi> their brother, as the good <hi>Samaritan</hi>
did every one his neighbour.</p>
            <p>Wherefore this condition of the Church that
is next, is exhibited to our view as an high
golden tower with crystal windows on the Sea
side, full of Lights by night, and the burnis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

gold and crystal glistering in the sun by day,
to shew us whitherto we should stear our course,
that we may conform all our outward actions
and inward motions as near as we can to this
excellent principle of Charity. The nature
whereof St. <hi>Paul</hi> has so accurately described
on purpose, one would think, that we might
be guided by the light thereof. And it is so
Divine and <hi>transcendent</hi> a principle, or <hi>deep</hi>
and profound, that a man may give all his goods
to the poor and his body to be burnt, and yet
either not have <hi>reached</hi> it, or else <hi>overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
it, and so be devoid of it, when a man
would think that so great a zeal and Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
could not be without that Celestial flame
of Holy Love.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVII"/> But methinks I hear you say,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of Charity with a brief ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof, and consequently of the state of the Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian <hi>Church.</hi>
               </note> if these be not
sure Symptomes of it, what I beseech you are?
The Apostle will tell you. For whenas the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
things may be done out of <hi>Self-Interest,</hi>
the Apostles description is of a pure and holy
<hi>unself-interessed</hi> Love, that arises out of the
Ruines, Death, or Annihilation of the <hi>Old
Man,</hi> in us, and is that <hi>Rectitude of Spirit,</hi>
of which our Saviour Christ declares,<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Blessed
are they that hunger and thirst after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<pb n="lxxiii" facs="tcp:59418:37"/>
for they shall be satisfied.</hi> As
on the contrary they are in a <hi>sad condition,</hi>
that never felt this hunger and thirst in them,
and are thereby convicted to be mere Strangers
and Aliens from the <hi>Life of God.</hi> But out
of the Annihilation and Mortification of our
own impetuous selfish will or lust, which is our
true purification from the life of the Flesh,
does this Divine or Vnself-interessed Love
arise, the effects whereof <hi>Paul</hi> describes
thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity suffereth long,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 4.</note> that is to say, is
slow to anger; and no wonder, Anger being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a passion raised out of a sense of injury
done to ones self. Charity <hi>is kind,</hi> as being
the Image of that God who according to Saint
<hi>John</hi> is love itself. <hi>Charity envieth not,</hi>
Forasmuch as the good of the Vniverse, and of
every man in particular is the very life and
pleasure of the regenerate soul, whose real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
is into this Divine Love. <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  </gap>, does nothing scurvily, rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
or <hi>tumultuarily,</hi> forasmuch as this Grace
arises out of the allaying or extinguishing all
the Impetuosities of our own wills and lusts.
<hi>Is not puffed up,</hi> this Spirit of Charity being
<pb n="lxxiv" facs="tcp:59418:38"/>
not an huffy blast of crude Enthusiasm, but
the permanent and solid life of God in us, into
which our Souls are regenerated by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the more of us hitting upon and approving the

It is not onely asserted by our Church but it is

that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Idolatrous. And

our Church in her Homilies does not stick
to intimate this bloudy Idolatrous Church to
be that Harlot in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> upon the

is the Antichrist. And Bishop <hi>Jewel</hi> in his

of sin <hi>(2 Thess. 2.)</hi> whom all the Ancients
understood of Antichrist, of the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> making the Antichrist predicted there,
<pb n="lxxxiii" facs="tcp:59418:42"/>
to be the Pope. And indeed what Protestant
writer before <hi>Grotius,</hi> ever expounded that
Prophecy of any other than the Pope? But

but dough-baked Protestants and in great peril
if occasion offer itself, to be amassed and

worse than the very Leaven of the Pharisees,

in the Primitive times, more in number and
more hainous in quality (as you may see in

Church was then the real Kingdome of Christ,
no more do those Sects that appear in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

hinder at all but they are the true Kingdome
of Christ also, and rightfully oppose the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Antichrist, as the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
did the Kingdome of the Dragon. And
that Reformed Christendome being in truth
the Kingdome of Christ, our inference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
is very sound, that we ought from the
very heart to give all Reverence and obedience
in things indifferent to the Magistrates thereof,
a duty which is owing even to Pagan Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates

            </p>

and genuinely Christian in this point without
the least leaning towards Libertinism and

fire, namely upon the shore of the <hi>Red Sea</hi>
(for what reason so called it matters not) in
which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Host was overthrown,
as the Pope and his Pontifician Clergy defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Witnesses professing, <hi>That a true
and living faith in the bloud of Christ</hi>
(which the Title of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> is a Symbol
of) <hi>for remission of sins does alone justify
us before God.</hi> Whereby they flung off a
load of trumperies and tedious impositions of
humane invention, by which they were kept
in a worse than <hi>Aegyptian</hi> servitude under the
Pope and Pontifician Clergy. And therefore
the Reformed Churches are brought in, in the
above-cited place of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> (in
<pb n="xcii" facs="tcp:59418:47"/>
imitation of the <hi>Israelites</hi> that had escaped
the thraldome of <hi>Pharaoh)</hi> singing a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
song on the shore, as it were, of the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>Red Sea,</hi> where the Roman <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and
his tyrannical Hierarchy were overthrown,
and that wretched bondage, which those <hi>true

and quite escaped.</p>

comfort from the Gospel, and wonderfull
efficacy to make men <hi>truly</hi> good, they hid from
the eyes of the people; and whenas the very

Religion is a sincere and vehement Love of our

require) in this Covenant of grace, this high
honour and affection we bear to Christ, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and peace of mind we have in the merits
of his most precious bloud and passion, those
supplies, by his promised Spirit, of illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

by multiplying of false Patrons and the vain

all hopes of illumination and direction from
the blessed Spirit of Christ, that the members
of that Church are made not onely so many
slaves, bereft of their Christian liberty and
enjoyment of the love of Christ that procured
it, but so many senseless stocks or stones, as
to Divine matters, and are taught to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all that recumbency that every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
has on the person of our faithful High
Priest, upon the persons of these unskilful and,
which is worse, unfaithful Tamperers with the
Souls of men.</p>
            <p>Whose Salvation consisting in a lively
faith and sincere love, honour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on the person of our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and doing the things that He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
these deceitful Emissaries of <hi>Rome,</hi>
O Detestable Treachery! carry on such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
or rather Superstition, as whose very
nature is to abuse that Religious inclination

away their love and zeal upon false objects,
and to spend their obedience on the vain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of men; by making them rely on
the falsly supposed merits of Saints, and to
depend upon the person and Trumperies of
an ignorant or deceitful Priest, instead of
having their sure repose in the richness of the
mercy of God through Christ Iesus our Lord.
To whom if we be immediately united by
faith and love, and shew our love by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
sincerely, to our power, to keep <hi>His</hi>
commandments, this is the plain and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious

platform of our Reformation. Has Sense?
common Reason? the Rudiments of Logick?
the sound Principles of Philosophy any weight
with them? all these assuredly witness for us
against the impossible figments and fond for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Has Morality
and indispensable Principles of common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
(which the pretence of no Religion
<pb n="xcviii" facs="tcp:59418:50"/>
ought in any wise to deface) Has the eternal
law of God and Nature implanted in our hearts
any right to be appealed to? we right willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeal to it, how innocent the Form of our
Religion is as to this, and how foul and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
will be found the Principles of the
Papacy. And finally has the attestation of
Scripture and bloud of Martyrs, some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousands of innocent and holy Souls,
burnt and massacred by these Antichristian
Persecutors? have such <hi>serious</hi> Testimonies
any force with them? then have we even a
cloud of Witnesses in the behalf of the Truth
of our Reformed Religion against the impious
corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>The plain places of Scripture expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the worship of Images, the praying in
an unknown tongue, the communicating but
in one kind, and the like. And the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
do not onely declare the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
to be the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Pope An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
but those that professed the faith of
the Reformed Churches, to be the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
to be the Martyrs of Iesus, and the
Saints of the most High. Such a Seal is
<pb n="xcix" facs="tcp:59418:50"/>
there set to the truth of the profession of the
Reformed Religion against the enormous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of Popery, even by the bloud of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
numbers of the serious and faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of our Lord Christ, that I may not say
even by the bloud of Christ himself. <hi>Who gave
himself,</hi> and shed his most precious bloud on the
cross, <hi>for his Church that he might sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
it, and cleanse it, as with the washing
of water, by the word of God:</hi> and the
Pope keeps the word of God from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the people that they may wallow
in the black mire of ignorance and the filth
of Idolatry, for the gain of Holy Church.
Christ the true Bridegroom gave himself for
his Church that he might present it to himself
a glorious Church most illustriously shining
forth in the fruits of the Spirit and the
works of real Righteousness declared in the
Gospel: But the Pope blasphemously arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
that Title of <hi>Sponsus Ecclesiae,</hi> to
himself, has debauched the Church, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
it a glorious Church to Christ her
true Husband, but in a whorish, pompous
dress contrary to the Christian mans very
<pb n="c" facs="tcp:59418:51"/>
promise in Baptism (to forsake the pomps
and vanities of this wicked world) presents
it to himself a garis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, gorgeous, Idolatrous
Church for the satisfaction of his own pride
and lust. And whenas Christ the true Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
gave himself for the Church <hi>that she
might have neither spot nor wrinkle nor
any such thing, but be holy and without
blemish,</hi> the whole body of the Religion of
the Roman Church so far forth as it differs
from the Ioynt Profession of the Reformed
Churches, is nothing but an overspread le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie
of grosly false Doctrines, and of foully
Superstitious, and Idolatrous Practices, besides
being smeared over and over again with the
bloud of the innocent, and carrying on a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
design and trade of eluding all the
force of true Religion and piety by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of humane inventions, and breaking off
our comfortable recumbence and dependence
upon the lovely person of our Lord Iesus
our faithful Saviour and Redeemer, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the person of some ignorant or
deceitful Wight, that bewilders a deluded
Soul with a world of false devices and trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries,
<pb n="ci" facs="tcp:59418:51"/>
giving her no solid rest after she
has once strayed from the simplicity of the
Gospel of Christ, and fallen into the hands
of these deceivers, who are sealed and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crustated
in the trade of their impieties by
a false and boastful pretence of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Infallibility, and under the colour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
declaring the true and faithful servants
of Christ Hereticks, they thereby snatch all
occasions to drink and swill and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
drunk with the bloud of the Saints of
the most High.</p>
            <p>From whence it is plain that the Roman
Church is an estranged Synagogue, which is
no Spouse of Christ, but the Spouse of the
Pope, as he boastfully pretends to be her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
So contrary does this Successour of
St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note> who
espoused the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> as a chast
virgin not to himself but to Christ, but the
Pope the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not to Christ but
to himself, and not a chast virgin but all to
be polluted with the filth of Idolatry which is
Spiritual fornication. But Reformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
is the Spouse of Christ as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="cii" facs="tcp:59418:52"/>
no Husband but him, and depending
immediately upon him by faith in his bloud
alone and sincere obedience to his commands
(and not to the vain injunctions and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men) for her justification and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
And for such a Church his own chast
Spouse has Christ given himself, and poured
forth his most precious bloud, and not for
those that have espoused themselves to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Husband. Which is also a sound Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and may go for a most firm and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Seal to the saving Truth of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion.</p>
            <p>These things I have taken the boldness to
speak with all freedome out of sincere love
and faithfulness to the Souls of men of what
communion soever, that those that are
already deluded may be undeceived, and they
that are yet of our Communion may never so
deeply sin against their own souls as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from it, and so dislodging themselves
out of the bosome of Christ run into the arms
of that man of sin and son of perdition the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

EXPOSITION
Of the several
Prophecies or Divine Uisions
OF THE
Prophet Daniel.</head>
            <head>VISION I.</head>
            <argument>
               <p> The Vision of the Image of the Four Metals signifying
the Four Empires, Babylonian, Medo-Persian,
Greek and Roman, seen first by Nebuchadnezzar,
and after revealed to Daniel, Dan. 2.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN the second Year of his Reign (which is now
about 2300 Years ago) did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sollicitous concerning the Fate of his own
Empire and what would be afterwards, his thoughts
coming into his mind upon his Bed, as it is said
Ver. 29. fall into a Dream, which much affected
him when he was in it, and therefore was earnestly
desirous to recall it into his mind again; but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able, he sent for his Magicians, Astrologers, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59418:54"/>
and Chaldeans, to try if they could divine
what this Dream was. For the thing was gone from
him, neither could he recover it into his mind. But
if they could have declared unto him what it was,
he could then have very-well remembred he had
dream'd it. Which forgetfulness of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
in not retaining the Dream in his mind, as well as
the <hi>Impression</hi> of the Dream it self, is no small Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Providence of God over his Church and
People, for whose sake these things happened, <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> should dream this Dream that
concerned the Church of God infinitely more than
himself, and that he should forget it, to the baffling
of all his Magicians, Sorcerers and Chaldeans; and
that <hi>Daniel</hi> a Jewish Youth, and one of the people
of God, should by Divine Revelation have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of declaring the King's Dream unto him, so that
the King could not but acknowledge that this was
the Dream. By which alone it was manifest that
the Spirit of the Holy God was in him.</p>
            <p>And the Dream, it concerning the people of God,
(more than <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> himself) whether Jews
or Christians, there was this singular good effect
thereof, that they could not but be more certainly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
that it was a truly Divine Dream, neither
feigned by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> nor by <hi>Daniel,</hi> but
communicated to both by God, either immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or by the ministry of his Holy Angels. And
that therefore <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>iel</hi> having this privilege of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Dream, had also the same
supernatural privilege of rightly interpreting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
The Declaration and Interpretation whereof
is as follows, which we shall expound as briefly
and as clearly as we may, where there is need,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59418:54"/>
beginning at the 31 Verse. For it will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
to observe how the Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>iguration of things
in this Prophetical Dream reaches from <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>'s
time not to our days only but even to the
pouring forth of the <hi>seventh Vial,</hi> whereupon, all the
Kingdoms of the World will become the Kingdom of
the Lord and of his Christ.</p>
            <p>31. <hi>Thou O King,</hi> when thy thoughts came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy mind upon thy Bed, and thou didst fall into
that Dream, <hi>sawest, and behold a great Image,</hi> or
great Statue of a Colossean bigness, it comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in its extent no less than the succession of Four
Famous Empires. <hi>This great Image whose bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was excellent,</hi> it representing the Splendour and
Glory of those Empires it did prefigure, <hi>stood before
thee. And the form thereof was terrible,</hi> setting
out thereby the great Fear and Awe these Empires,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Supreme Powers therein and their Ministers,
cast the World into by their severity, violence and
cruelty. For which cause in another Vision they
are resembled to wild Beasts for their rage and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirstiness,
as the true Church of God has too often
found them.</p>
            <p>32. <hi>This Image's head was of fine Gold.</hi> There
being a Succession of Four Empires here to be prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
by Four kind of Metals, the order of <hi>dignity</hi>
or pretiosity in the Metals is made use of to set out
the order of time, in the succession of the Empires.
And therefore because Gold is first in esteem amongst
Metals, therefore the Golden part of the Image the
Head, both because it is the Head, and of Gold, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
the first Empire the Church of God, or People
of the Jews were concerned in, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Babylonian</hi>
under whom they were then Captive. But as for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59418:55"/>
the Ten Tribes they were carried away into perpetual
Captivity by <hi>Salmanasser</hi> King of <hi>Assyria</hi> long before,
never to be heard of again, at least during the time of
these Four Empires here prefigured. But the Jews
<hi>properly</hi> so called were concerned first under the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi>
Empire, then under the <hi>Medo-Persian;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
being given out first by <hi>Cyrus</hi> then <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
in their behalf though <hi>Cambyses</hi> was unkind to them.
And under the great <hi>Xerxes</hi> by reason of his Queen
<hi>Esther</hi> a Jew they had a signal deliverance from their
bloudy Enemy <hi>Haman.</hi> And how they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
during the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, especially under
<hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and much more under the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
is so notorious, that it is enough only to name
it. Which reasons may suffice why no more King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
or Empires, and why these especially, <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,
Medo-Persian, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> are compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in this Image. The first whereof was signified
by the Image's Head of fine Gold, as <hi>Daniel</hi> himself
will anon interpret. <hi>His Breast and his Arms of
Silver.</hi> The Arm is properly that part of the Body
which reaches from the Shoulder to the Wrist, and
so excludes the <hi>hand,</hi> of which there is here no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
though there be mention of <hi>feet</hi> adjoyned to
the Legs. Which is not fortuitous but designed. For
this Breast with its Arms of Silver denotes the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi>
Empire, which consisting of Two People,
the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> they are fitly represented by
these Two Arms, but with no mention of Hands of
which the <hi>Ten</hi> Fingers would be the Natural parts,
because there was no division of the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi>
Empire into Ten Kingdoms as there was of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
His Belly and his Thighs of Brass.</hi> By this
Belly and the Two Thighs of Brass is understood the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59418:55"/>
               <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, which was One in <hi>Alexander,</hi> but
after his death divided more notably and durably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Two Kingdoms of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae.</hi>
For at first there was a <hi>Quadripartition</hi> of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
but that not lasting so long, or all parts of it
being not so famous, or the <hi>Iews</hi> not so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in them, this general Prefiguration of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Four Empires, takes notice only of what
is most remarkable, as those Two were.</p>
            <p>33. <hi>His Legs of Iron.</hi> Here begins the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire; suppose upon <hi>Aemylius Paulus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi>
Consul his vanquishing of <hi>Perseus</hi> the last King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia.</hi>
From which time the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the
Prophetical account may rationally seem to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Macedonick</hi> Empire properly so
called being then put an end to, though other parts
still remained. And here the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire may
very well be represented by the Two Legs, that State
for many Hundred years being most-what supported
by the Supreme Power of their Two Consuls. And
so this Character may be alluded to by the Two Legs,
to understand what People is meant, though the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Empire commence no higher than from
the vanquishing <hi>Perseus</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> by <hi>Aemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
the Consul. Which Consular Power continued
above an Hundred years after, and the Name much
longer. So fit an Emblem are these Two Legs of
Iron, of the People of <hi>Rome</hi> and their Empire. <hi>His
Féet part of Iron, and part of Clay.</hi> Which Feet
imply the <hi>Ten Toes</hi> which are parts of the Feet, and
therefore represent the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire divided into
<hi>Ten Kingdoms.</hi> Which Ten Kingdoms are also prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
by the Ten Horns of the Fourth Beast, Chap. 7.
The division of which <hi>Roman</hi> Empire into Ten King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59418:56"/>
happening since the Empire became Christian,
we may better thence understand what is meant by
the Feet being partly of <hi>Iron,</hi> and partly of <hi>Clay,</hi>
namely, That in that time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire it
was become partly <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and partly <hi>Secular,</hi>
by the <hi>Iron</hi> as before understanding the <hi>Secular</hi> Power,
by the <hi>Clay</hi> the <hi>Ecclesiastical.</hi> Which Clay, or Earth
here in <hi>Daniel</hi> seems to be alluded to <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. 16.
where the <hi>Earth</hi> is said to help the Woman, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
an OEcumenical Council, by opening its mouth
and swallowing down the floud of Contention (which
the <hi>Arians</hi> especially had raised) by their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that Heresie: as if a Clayie ground should
cleave with a wide scissure and swallow down a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Torrent, or Land-floud.</p>
            <p>34. <hi>Thou sawest till a Stone was cut out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> that is, Besides this Image and the Four
distinct Metalline parts thereof, thou sawest more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
a Stone cut out without hands, no man with
Axe or Gavelock dissevering it. Which Stone is Christ
and his true Church, himself being born in a supernatural
way by the over-shadowing of the Holy
Ghost, and his Church being raised and propagated
in a supernatural way by the assistance also of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, by real Miracles, by unfeigned Sanctity,
and by invincible Patience and Suffering for the Truth.
Wherefore the true Christian Church, Head with
the Members, this is that Stone cut out without
hand, <hi>which smote the Image upon his Féet, which
were of Iron and Clay, and brake them in pieces.</hi>
This true Apostolick Church which appeared with
Christ and his Apostles, and so on in the pure Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times, will at last strike the Image upon his Feet,
namely, under the Seventh Vial, or at that War of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59418:56"/>
the Rider on the White Horse. Wherein the Beast
and the False Prophet (the remainder of the <hi>Iron</hi> and
degenerate <hi>Clay)</hi> are cast into a Lake of Fire burning
with Brimstone, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19. 21.</p>
            <p>35. <hi>Then was the Iron, the Clay, the Brass,
the Silver, and the Gold broken to pieces together,
and became like the Chaff of the Summer thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oor,
and the Wind carried them away that no
place was found for them.</hi> This plainly answers to
the casting the Beast and the False Prophet into the
Lake of Fire burning with Brimstone. Both places
signifie the utter abolishing all the Idolatrous Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
remaining in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire at that time, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Secular or Ecclesiastical Powers. But that
then the Clay, Brass, Silver, and Gold are said to be
broken to pieces together, that is only an embellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the external <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Vision. The suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of these Four Empires being exhibited at once,
they are made also to fall to dust at once together.
Besides that the <hi>succeeding</hi> Empire most-what occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying
the Possession and Territories of the <hi>Antecedent,</hi>
that which vanquisheth the last may in some sense be
thought to vanquish them all at a clap, or to possess
what any of them had. Which will be immediately
made good in the next words. <hi>And the Stone that

well noted) as the State before this may be called
<hi>Regnum Lapidis,</hi> the Kingdom of the Stone.</p>
            <p>36. <hi>This is the Dream,</hi> Which miraculously and
by the mere inspiration of the Spirit of the most High
was communicated unto me, and which the King
cannot deny but to have been the Dream which he
was so desirous to recover into his mind. <hi>And we
will tell the Interpretation thereof before the King.</hi>
Which he may be sure is true and Divinely inspired,
it being impossible any man should know the thoughts
of another man, especially so strange and operose as
these, unless he were inspired. Whence my <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
the Dream ought to be look'd upon as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
assurance of the truth of my <hi>Interpretation;</hi>
which is this.</p>
            <p>37. <hi>Thou, O King, art a King of Kings,</hi> that
is, The greatest King on Earth. <hi>For the God of
Heaven hath given thée a Kingdom, Power, and
Strength, and Glory.</hi> Thou hast a Strong, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and Glorious Kingdom, and it is the gift of
God unto thee, and therefore thou shouldst remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to govern as his Vice-gerent.</p>
            <p>38. <hi>And wheresoever the Children of men dwell,
viz.</hi> the cultivated places of his Kingdom, <hi>The Beasts
of the Field,</hi> The desart places of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi>
says <hi>Grotins, And the Fowls of the Heaven,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

of Heaven can nest, <hi>Hath he given into thy hand,
and hath made thée Ruler over them all.</hi> All these
diversities of the vast places of thy Kingdom art thou
Lord over. And God having given thee so large an
Empire, so prosperous and glorious, I declare unto
thee, <hi>Thou art this Head of Gold.</hi> Which is briefly

            <p>39. <hi>And after thée shall arise another Kingdom
inferiour to thée.</hi> The first Empire comprised in
this Image being thus evidently the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> it
does naturally follow that the Second must be the
<hi>Medo-Persian</hi> begun in <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Who first having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Belshazzar</hi> the last King being slain
by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> he brought along with
him, though he delivered the Empire to his Uncle
<hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede;</hi> yet he being aged, and dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a year or two he presently succeeded him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Monarch of the <hi>Medes</hi> as well as <hi>Persians,</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
also being a <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> by extraction, on the
Mother's side a <hi>Mede,</hi> and on the Father's side a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian.</hi>
Whence he was called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or a Mule, as
<hi>Grotius</hi> notes. But that the coalescency of these Two
Nations into One Kingdom or Empire, is signified
by the Silver part of the Image which is the Breast
from which the Two Arms come, has been noted
above.</p>
            <p>The hardest scruple is, how this <hi>Medo Persian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
should be said to be less than that of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>'s,
the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> there being the accession
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59418:58"/>
of <hi>Persia,</hi> and all the Acquists of <hi>Cyrus</hi> added thereto.
<hi>Grotius</hi> his answer is, <hi>Quia Cyrus &amp; successores ejus
Africam non tenuerunt. Gasper Sanctius,</hi> That there
was not that pacateness nor tranquillity in the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi>
Empire that there was in the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> or
so continued prosperity and success. <hi>Calvin</hi> makes
one Empire inferiour to another, (as the Metals are
from Gold to Iron,) in Morality, Temperance, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
Faithfulness, &amp;c. according to that vulgar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
expressed in <hi>Horace, Carm. lib. 3. od.</hi> 6.
<q>
                  <l>Aetas parentum pejor avis tulit</l>

                  <l>Progeniem vitiosiorem.</l>
               </q>
Whence sprung that Poetical description of the World's
degenerating according to the Four Ages thereof,
from Gold to Silver, from Silver to Brass, and from
Brass to Iron. Which in all likelihood was more
particularly occasioned from <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Dream
of this Image of those Four Metals, Antiquity not
understanding the true sense thereof.</p>
            <p>But it is possible that forasmuch as it is read, <hi>And
after thee shall arise another Kingdom inferiour to
thee;</hi> that [to thee,] is here on purpose put for [to
thine,] that the <hi>first Head</hi> of this following King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
might be understood to be more especially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>him,</hi> in which there seems apparent odds.
For <hi>Cyrus</hi> the first Head of the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
or Empire reigned not past Two or Three years
in that inlarged Empire, and not passing Thirty in
his Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> whenas <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in
his <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire reigned Three and forty years
most splendidly and prosperously, insomuch that the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59418:58"/>
excess of his prosperity cast him into that Septennial
delirancy, out of which he was recovered and gave
praise to the God of Heaven. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> as he reigned
but a small time in the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Empire, so he
was vanquished ingloriously by the hand of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>Tomyris,</hi> a <hi>Scythian</hi> Queen, who cut off his
Head and cast it into a Vessel of bloud saying, <hi>Satia
te, Cyre, sanguine, quem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>itisti.</hi> But whether this
way or that way please best to make the easiest sense
of the Text, it is unavoidably plain, that this second
Monarchy is the <hi>Medo-Persian,</hi> nor does any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
doubt of it. <hi>And another third Kingdom of
Brass.</hi> This shews plainly, that the Golden, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and Brass parts of the Image, signifie Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Kingdoms. But now it is evident in History
that as the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Empire succeeded the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian,</hi>
so the <hi>Macedonick,</hi> or <hi>Grecian,</hi> succeeded the
<hi>Medo-Persian.</hi> For <hi>Alexander Macedo</hi> after he had
vanquished <hi>Darius Codomannus</hi> in his last Battle at
<hi>Arbela, (Darius</hi> being slain some Six months after
by <hi>Bessus</hi> one of the Peers of his own Empire, and
<hi>Babylon</hi> taken,) translated the Monarchy from the
<hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> about the third year
of the 112 Olympiad. And that the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire
was not unfitly set out by the Two Thighs of Brass,
by reason of those Two most eminent parts of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which after <hi>Alexander</hi>'s death it was divided, and
stood so divided for a long time, namely, the Two
Kingdoms of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above. And it may not be altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to Note also what <hi>Iustin</hi> writes, <hi>Lib. 12. Eâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
quâ natus est</hi> Alexander <hi>duae Aquilae totâ die prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petes

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59418:59"/>
shall bear rule over all the Earth.</hi>
               </hi> So it is said of
him, <hi>I Maccab. I. He made many Wars, and won
many strong holds, and slew the Kings of the Earth,
and went through to the ends of the Earth.</hi> And so
<hi>Iustin, Lib.</hi> 12. From the utmost Coasts of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
were Embassies sent to him returning to <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
both of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and other Cities of
<hi>Africk,</hi> yea of <hi>Spain, Sicily, France, Sardinia.</hi> And
some also from <hi>Italy</hi> expected his return to <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

this prediction sutes with the event.</p>
            <p>40. <hi>And the fourth Kingdom shall be as strong as
Iron.</hi> That this fourth Kingdom is the <hi>Roman</hi> is
manifest from hence that it succeeds the <hi>Greek</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
which it may seem most properly first to seise
upon, when <hi>Aemylius Paulus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Consul had

about an Age after the Kingdoms of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and

the Husband of <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Daughter of <hi>Ptolemaeus
Auletes,</hi> the last but one of the <hi>Lagidae,</hi> or Kings of
<hi>Aegypt.</hi> Whence it is plain that the <hi>Roman</hi> succeeds
the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire as the <hi>Greek</hi> the <hi>Medo Persian,</hi> and
that therefore this is the <hi>Fourth</hi> Kingdom prefigured
by the Image of <hi>Four</hi> several Metals. And the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the former days of it
especially, sutes well with this Metal, they being
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59418:59"/>
not only full of courage and valour, but also hardy,
rigid, severe, and indeed cruel. They that are any
thing versed in History will easily acknowledge this
a fitting Character. To which you may add what
is intimated in the Text, namely, that as Iron can
cut, and form, and subdue all those Three first Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
Gold, Silver and Brass, so the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
could vanquish and subdue all those Regions wherein
the <hi>Babylonian, Medo-Persian,</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire
was spread. Which feat not being done by the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> it is impossible
they should be the Fourth Kingdom of <hi>Daniel.</hi> And
besides this, we may be infallibly sure that the Fourth
Kingdom is the <hi>Roman,</hi> in that the Stone cut out
without hands happened, during the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
(and it must happen in some of the Four Kingdoms
according to the Vision,) and not during the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae. <hi>Forasmuch as
Iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things, and
as Iron breaketh all these,</hi> viz.</hi> all these Metals of
Gold, Silver and Brass, <hi>shall it,</hi> this <hi>Roman</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or Empire, <hi>break in pieces and bruise,</hi> the
Countries and People which the <hi>Babylonian, Medo-Persian,</hi>
and <hi>Grecian</hi> Empires had ruled over.</p>
            <p>41. <hi>And whereas thou sawest the Féet and Coes.</hi>
Here is mention made of <hi>Toes</hi> with the <hi>Feet,</hi> which
justifies our exposition above, Ver. 33. But now we
are come hither, we must remember we are come
unto that period of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire when it was
divided into <hi>Ten Kingdoms,</hi> which are intimated by
the <hi>Ten Toes</hi> of the Statue. Which <hi>Ten Toes</hi> answer
to the <hi>Ten Horns</hi> of the Beast actually crowned. Which
is the time that the Two horned Beast rises out of
the <hi>Earth:</hi> so it is said, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. And why not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59418:60"/>
out of a <hi>white Clayie clammy Earth,</hi> such as Potters
make use of, as well as out of any other <hi>Earth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.
And no man I think while he considers that
the <hi>Iron</hi> here signified <hi>men,</hi> a body Politick of them,
can stick to admit that this <hi>Clay</hi> does signifie so
likewise. But there being so palpable a <hi>difference</hi>
betwixt <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> it is manifest that there
must be as great a difference betwixt these Two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Politick, the one signified by the <hi>Iron,</hi> the other
by the <hi>Clay;</hi> the former suppose the <hi>Secular</hi> Power,
the latter the <hi>Ecclesiastical;</hi> as it is said of the Papal
Hierarchy, which is the little Horn, Chap. 7. 24. that
that Horn or King shall be <hi>diverse</hi> from the rest,
which <hi>diversification</hi> here betwixt the <hi>Secular</hi> and
<hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Power, signified by the <hi>Iron</hi> and the
<hi>Clay,</hi> need not be expressed in <hi>words,</hi> the <hi>Symbols</hi>
themselves being so apparently <hi>different. <hi>Part of

               </hi> that is, partly
of such clammy white <hi>Clay</hi> as Potters make use of,

the Empire was divided into Ten Kingdoms, the

or shared betwixt the <hi>Papal</hi> or Sacerdotal Hierarchy,
and the <hi>Secular</hi> Orders of Emperours and Kings. For
the <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay</hi> cannot stand for the division of the
Empire into <hi>Ten</hi> Kingdoms, for that the <hi>Ten Toes</hi>
prefigure, but the sharing the <hi>Summa Potestas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59418:60"/>
the Secular Magistrate and Papal, or Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Hierarchy. <hi>But there shall be in it of the strength
of the Iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the Iron
mixed with the miry Clay:</hi> that is to say, The
Sword-men or Secular Power of the Ten Kings was
so assured to the maintaining the Power and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
of the Papal Hierarchy (though never so foul
or Idolatrous, so they made for the Sacerdotal world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Interest) that the Papal Empire, or the Empire
framed according to that pattern and scope, was as
it were strengthned with Iron. Which is that which
is intimated <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. 13. where the Ten Kings are
said to give their Strength and Power to the <hi>Beast
that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> Which is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
refashioned again into a Pagan-like Idolatrous
Form, for the worldly advantage of the Papal Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy.
Thus was the Iron mixed with the miry
Clay, the Ten Kings cleaving so close to the interest
of the Papal Idolatrous Clergy.</p>
            <p>42. <hi>And as the Toes of the Féet were part of
Iron, and part of Clay,</hi> that is, And as every one
of those Ten Kingdoms consisted of Temporal power
and Ecclesiastical, the Papal Hierarchy being bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
through all the Ten Kingdoms till the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
<hi>So the Kingdom shall be partly strong,
and partly broken;</hi> that is, The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into these Ten Kingdoms shall be partly strong,
and partly brittle; the Papal Power weakening the
absolute Power of each Kingdom, and occasioning
many breaches and jars in Christendom.</p>
            <p>43. <hi>And whereas thou sawest Iron m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

the great Ecclesiastick Sovereign, and to all the Rites,

of such instruments as these, I conceive to
be alluded to, as if he should say, They shall mingle

<hi>by the sowing or planting of men in the Seminaries</hi>
abovesaid, fitting them for the foresaid purpose, the
more brisk, cunning, and gentile attacking Princes

hanging fast on the people, and clarting upon them,
and keeping warm in them all the modes of Idolatry
and Superstition, and all the Principles and Practices
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59418:61"/>
that may be gainfull to the Papal Hierarchy. Thus
the Clay sticks to the Iron as well as it can. <hi>But
they shall not cleave</hi> (so very firmly) <hi>one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even as Iron is not mixed with Clay.</hi> And
what Bickerings and Clashings there have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
these Two Powers, the <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi>
in particular Kingdoms, the Chronicles of each King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
will declare: As also what combates there have
been betwixt the Pope and the Emperours, both
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>German,</hi> is notoriously known to all. I will
only cite one passage out of <hi>The Defence of the Right
of Kings,</hi> written by King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed Memory.
Let Histories be searched, saith he, Let just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
be taken, and beside many Sieges laid to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it will appear by true computation, that <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fourth, and <hi>Frederick</hi> the First fought above
Threescore Battles in defence of their own Right
against the enemies of the Empire, stirred up to Arms
by the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> And indeed the dealings and
usurpations of that Hierarchy grew so intolerable that
many Kingdoms at last shook them off, and would
admit the Papal Authority and Religion no longer.
Whereby was manifestly fulfilled which is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by <hi>Daniel, That they shall not cleave one to
another, even as Iron is not mixed with Clay.</hi> It is
an unnatural and heterogeneal union, and therefore
not durable and permanent. This passage therefore
in <hi>Daniel</hi> seems to answer to that in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi>
Ch. 17. v. 16. <hi>And the ten Horns which thou sawest
upon the Beast they shall hate the Whore, and make
her desolate and naked,</hi> &amp;c. Which was performed
in some measure in the happy Reformation begun in
<hi>Luther</hi>'s days, and when there will be a farther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of it, lies wholly in the pleasure of the
Almighty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59418:62"/>44. <hi>And in the days of these Kings shall the God
of Heaven set up a Kingdom which shall never be
destroyed.</hi> After <hi>Daniel</hi> in his Interpretation has
gone through all the Empires comprised in that Image
which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> saw from head to foot, now
he begins to explain the mystery of the <hi>Stone cut out
without hands;</hi> whereby is understood Christ, with
his truly pure Apostolick Church. Wherefore by
[in the days of these Kings] must be understood in
the days of the Fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire. For Christ was born, and his Gospel
divulged, and his Church first gathered in that time,
as every body must acknowledge. And the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
weeks plainly carry to that time also. But now
this pure Church of Christ being called the <hi>Kingdom</hi>
which the <hi>God of Heaven</hi> shall set up, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
from hence, how in our Saviour Christ's preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and mentioning the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> and the
<hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> that it had a respect to this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
And the use of those Phrases with him does fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ratifie our interpreting it thus, of the appearance
of Christ with his true Church. Which is rightly
called the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> or <hi>of God,</hi> because the
raising of it was by the special miraculous power of
the <hi>God of Heaven.</hi> And the administration of this
his true Church is by his Spirit from above in the
hearts of his true Believers. God does truly rule
there by his Spirit, whence it is rightly called the
Kingdom of God. <hi>Which shall never be destroyed.</hi>
The Gates of Hell shall never prevail against it. The
true and living Church which the Spirit of Christ
actuates, this shall never fail. <hi>And the Kingdom
shall not be left to other people.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> the <hi>Persians,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59418:62"/>
and the <hi>Romans</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but no Empire shall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
nor any People the true Christian Church which
is the Kingdom of God, which either as <hi>Regnum La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidis,</hi>
or else as <hi>Regnum Montis</hi> will last to the end

<hi>Regnum montis,</hi> it will have overspread, and will
possess, and keep in rule all the Countries that the
Four great Monarchies, signified by the Statue, had
occupied. And the Three former Kingdoms being as
it were incorporated into the Fourth, or because the
Four Kingdoms are in this Image exhibited at once,
the Kingdom of the Mountain, for the embellishing
the cortex of the Vision, is said to break in pieces
and consume all the other Kingdoms together, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Image on the Toes as I noted above. <hi>And

            <p>45. <hi>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the Stone
was cut out of the Mountain without hands;</hi> that
is, Forasmuch as the State of the true Church of
Christ is the absolute work of God, carried on by his
special Providence not by humane arts or policies,
and that it was thus begun, and that he is with his
Church to the end of the World: <hi>And that it broke
in pieces the Iron, the Brass, the Clay, and the
Silver, and the Gold.</hi> Forasmuch as thou sawest
the Stone cut out of the Mountain without hands to
do this: Which signifies the true Church of Christ
thus supernaturally begun, and as supernaturally
emerging to this glorious issue at last. For as the
Stone was cut out without hands, so it will be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59418:63"/>
without hands to smite the Image on the Feet,
namely, by the power and conduct of the Spirit of
Christ, who will then open a door of success that no
man shall be able to shut, as it is said to the Church
of <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> considering, I say, that Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
it self is the Spring of this motion, and that it
does not depend on the humours and purposes of
men, I can of a truth declare unto the King that,
<hi>The Great God hath made known to the King what
shall come to pass hereafter,</hi> or after this, namely,
after the demolition of all these Four Empires, the
Vision reaching to the end of the World, which that
expected glorious State of the true Church will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede,
when the <hi>Kingdom of the Stone</hi> cut out of the
Mountain, that is, out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, shall
it self become the <hi>Kingdom of the Mountain,</hi> and fill
the whole Earth, that is, when that State of the
glorious and pure Church shall spread over all. <hi>And
the Dream is certain, and the Interpretation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
sure;</hi> and more particularly touching that excellent
State of the Church concerning which it is said, <hi>Apoc.
21. 5. And he that sate upon the Throne said, Behold, I
make all things new. And he saith unto me Write, For
these words are true and faithfull. And he said unto
me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and the End,</hi> The Dream that he has interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
is certain, especially the most concerning part
thereof, the Glory and Prosperity of the true Church
of Christ, it being to be atchieved by the irresistible
power of the Lord Jesus.</p>

Greek,</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> from their beginning to their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
were represented; so they are here in the very
same extent of time, notwithstanding this Vision was
seen towards the end of the first of these Empires,
namely, the <hi>Babylonian.</hi> Which manner of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
in Prophetical Type part of time past in a <hi>Set</hi>
of Visions, is made use of also in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> the
greatest part of the time of the first of the Six Visions
in the <hi>First Six Seals</hi> being expir'd when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saw
them. And there is the same reason of the <hi>Set</hi> of
Visions of the <hi>seven Churches</hi> which begin, as that
of the <hi>Seals,</hi> from the first Epocha of Christianity,
as does also the Vision of the measuring the <hi>Inner</hi>
and <hi>Outer</hi> Court, and the <hi>Woman</hi> clothed with the
<hi>Sun</hi> with <hi>Twelve Stars</hi> upon her head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There
was about Sixty years from the Epocha of S. <hi>Iohn's</hi>
Visions to the time he saw them; and less from the
beginning of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire till <hi>Daniel</hi>'s see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Vision of the Four Beasts. So that this is
no obstacle, but that the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire may be
here represented, from its beginning, though <hi>Daniel</hi>
saw this Vision toward the end thereof.</p>
            <p>But because that in a <hi>Set</hi> of Prophetical Visions,
a little snip of time (in comparison of what the whole
Set of Visions takes in) may be set out by some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59418:65"/>
part of that Set of Visions, to take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of interpreting a whole Set of Visions <hi>(viz.</hi> all the
Six Seals, nay Two whole Sets of Visions succeeding
one another, <hi>viz.</hi> all the Six Trumpets succeeding the
Six Seals) of things past when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saw those Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
as <hi>Grotius</hi> does, is so wild and extravagant, that
it may well astonish any sober man, to see a person
of so considerable Parts and Learning to fall into such
a delirancy. But what we here adventure on is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
enough, <hi>viz.</hi> the supposing that the <hi>Babylonian</hi>
Empire even from its beginning is here represented
by the First Beast, there being the like liberty taken
in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> And this being supposed, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
will run smoothly and unexceptionably.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In the first year of Belshazzar</hi> (the Son of <hi>Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Merodac,</hi>
who was the Son of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar) <hi>King
of Babylon,</hi>
               </hi> namely, the last King of <hi>Babylon</hi> who
was slain by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> the City <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
being taken by <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the Eighteenth year of
<hi>Belshazzar</hi>'s Reign, according to <hi>Thomas Lydiat.
<hi>Daniel had a Dream and Uision of his head upon
his bed.</hi>
               </hi> He had a Divine Vision communicated to
him in his sleep. For Prophetical <hi>Visions</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the Prophets either way, either <hi>sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
or <hi>waking,</hi> and they are either way truly Divine.
<hi>Then he wrote the Dream, and told the sum of the
matters;</hi> that is to say, He declared the sum of the
matters in writing.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Daniel Spake and said, <hi>viz.</hi>

language is understood vast multitudes of
People that overspread the face of the Earth, as the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59418:65"/>
Waters of the Sea doe. By the <hi>Winds</hi> is understood
that invisible Principle of motion, from whence comes
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>icissitude of mutations amongst the Nations of
the Earth, who are driven this way and that way
according as the active part, whatever it is, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
here to the Winds, doth move them: Whether
they be Angelical Powers which superintend the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Nations, or what-ever else. And it is said in
the <hi>Psalms, Who maketh his Angels Spirits, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
a flaming Fire.</hi> On which <hi>Grotius</hi> learnedly
and ingeniously glosses thus, <hi>Psal. 104. 4. Sunt Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum
alii Aerei, alii Ignei,</hi> and a little after, <hi>Esse
Angelis corpora sed subtilissima non</hi> Pythagorae <hi>tantùm
&amp;</hi> Platonis <hi>Schola sensit, sed &amp; Iudaei veteres &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teres Christiani.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The activity therefore of the Aerial <hi>Genii</hi> or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
may be understood by these <hi>Winds,</hi> or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
they bring in by Divine Providence in the
Production of new Empires, and demolition of the
old. From the subtility of their bodies, but it may
be chiefly from their activity in the Innovations and
Commutations of the affairs of mankind, in pulling
down and building up Kingdoms and Empires, these
Angelical orders are called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>venti.</hi> And there
is a quadripartition of them, <hi>(Zach. 6.)</hi> a distribution
of them into Four Chariots with various coloured
Horses. Where to the Prophet asking, what are these
my Lord? it is answered, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Isti sunt quatuor venti Coeli,</hi> where <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is the very
same word that is in <hi>Psal. 104. 4. These are the Four
Winds of Heaven,</hi> The Quaternio of the Angelical
Ministers of Divine Providence. Something like that
<hi>Apoc.</hi> 7. where there is mention of the Four Angels
at the Four Corners of the Earth, holding the Four
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59418:66"/>
Winds of the Earth that they should not blow on the
Earth, nor on the Sea. And that the great things
in the vicissitude of Kingdoms and Empires are done
by the Angels, is an Hypothesis that both <hi>Daniel</hi>
and the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> plainly supposes, the latter indeed
inculcates to awaken this dull Sadducean Age.</p>
            <p>This I don't doubt but is one sense of this passage
in <hi>Daniel,</hi> but if any one think it too sublime and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the vulgar capacity, he may substitute for
these Angelical Powers here denoted by the Winds,
the ambitious and unquiet minds of great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Politicians, and their Officers, and those
blusters they make in the World by their impetuous
activity to begin or increase their Dominion, and to
inlarge it into a more absolute Empire. But the
more sober may take in both Senses according to the
Genius of the Prophetick style, that by the same
Symbol exhibits frequently more things than one at
once.</p>
            <p>But that these Winds are said to be Four, it may
be partly in allusion to the Four Quarters of the
World, partly to the mystical meaning of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Four,</hi> in setting out the Angelical Kingdom or
Ministry, and partly to the Four Beasts that were
to arise in succession one after another out of the Sea,
by the striving thereon, not all together, but one
after another. For expressing the thing so as if they
all co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>cted one with another at the same time, is
but for the embellishing the Cortex of the Vision, of
which no more is to be taken in than is agreeable to
History and Reason.</p>
            <p>But this in the mean time is very remarkable, that
being the very Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ordia here of them all is premised
is necessarily follows that the Vis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ion reaches the very
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59418:66"/>
beginning of each Empire, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> as well as
the rest, or because it reaches the very beginning of
the first of these Empires, that that Empire must be
the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> as we shall see in the procedure.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>And four great Beasts came up from the Sea.</hi>
Which, as I said, shews that the Vision reaches the
very rise or first beginning of each of them. But
here we are again to Note that though all Four are
here mentioned together, yet the rising out of the
Sea was one after another. But their coming thus
out of the Sea together strikes the phancy more strong,
which is the peculiar scope of the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
both here and in the <hi>Apocalypse. <hi>Divers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
from another,</hi> viz.</hi> in shape and condition. But
in the mean time they are all <hi>Beasts.</hi> The Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint

the place, <hi>Ideo Bestiae,</hi> saith he, <hi>quia Idololatrica
erant Imperia ut not at hic</hi> Jacchiades. Their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
indeed shews their brutishness, being accustomed
to no higher a dispensation of Religion than adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of visible Objects, as the Elephant is said to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Moon. But cruelty is another ingredient
to make them <gap reason="foreign">

came to erect the Empire of Love and Charity, and
of pure Religion, the worshipping the Father in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and in truth.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The First was like a Lion,</hi> a Beast of a fulvid
or Golden colour, as the Poets describe him, and
the head of all Beasts, which is the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
signified also by the Golden head of the Image
or Statue. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> likewise describes
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> by this Animal,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59418:67"/>
Ch. 4. 7. <hi>The Lion is come up from his thicket, and the

                     </gap>,</hi>
               </hi> which betoken the quickness of his
dispatch in his expeditions and conquests. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the same Prophet speaking of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
his coming against the <hi>Iews,</hi> Ch. 4. 13. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
he shall come up,</hi> saith he, <hi>as Clouds, and his
Chariot shall be as a Whirlwind, his Horses are swif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Eagles, Wo unto us for we are spoiled.</hi> And
again, Ch. 40. <hi>Behold, he shall fly as an Eagle, and
shall spread his Wings over</hi> Moab. And many other
places there are concerning <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to the
same purpose. <hi>I beheld till the Wings thereof were
pluckt wherewith it was lifted up from the Earth.</hi>
For the Marginal [wherewith] in the <hi>English</hi> Bible
is better than [and] in the Text. And <hi>Grotius</hi> says,
<hi>Verte [per quas efferebatur supra terram.]</hi> And he
adds thus Note further, <hi>Saepe enim</hi> Chaldaeis <hi>ut &amp;</hi>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> will signifie [for] as well as [and] and
then the sense will be the same that <hi>Grotius</hi> drives at,
and the Septuagint ratifie it by translating <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which signifies, he was carried up on
high, not taken out of the way or destroyed, as
some would have it.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch his being thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
up on high on his Wings, may signifie both the
height of his prosperity and the haughtiness of his
mind, his ambition, as it is set out by the Prophet
<hi>Isaiah,</hi> Ch. 14. v. 14. where he brings him in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>I will ascend above the heights of the Clouds, I will
be like the most High.</hi> For this is to be understood
of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the whole succession is to
be look'd on as one King, as the Empire is look'd
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59418:67"/>
upon as one Beast. Now therefore [I beheld till the
Wings thereof were pluckt] is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
as if this plucking of the Wings could not be
but after the time of this Vision of <hi>Daniel,</hi> because,
as I proved above, the Vision reaches from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire, the Scene whereof
all along <hi>Daniel</hi> here beheld. Where amongst other
things he noted the plucking of the Wings of this
Lion, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch. Which happened
most notoriously in his being cast down from his lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
priding himself in his great Magnificence, Ch. 4.
30. <hi>Is not this great Babylon that I have built, by the
might of my Power, and for the honour of my Majesty?</hi>
Which was no sooner said by him, but he heard a.
voice from Heaven, <hi>O King</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>to thee
it is spoken, The Kingdom is departed from thee,</hi> &amp;c.
And so he was driven out to eat grass with the Beasts
of the Field, till Seven times passed over him. And
is not this a clipping of his Wings indeed, who was
soaring before above the Clouds? Instead of being
lifted up on high with his Wings from the Earth, he
was fain to graze on the ground with Oxen. <hi>And
was made stand on the feet as a man, and a man's
heart was given to it.</hi> Now after that Septennial
humiliation of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> by being cast into so
deep a melancholy and delirancy, as if he were grown
a very brute that goes on all Four, these words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
his happy recovery out of that deep disease.
For Physicians take notice of such a melancholy as
makes the party imagine himself to be, and to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the manners and nature of this or that Beast, as
you may see in <hi>Sennertus,</hi> and other Writers. But
here it seems he came to himself again by the good
Providence of God, and went constantly upon his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59418:68"/>
Feet as other men do. <hi>And a man's heart was given
unto him,</hi> that is, his humane understanding was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
unto him. For the Phrase of Scripture makes
the heart the Seat of understanding. Instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of having the mind or heart of either a Brute or
Luciferian Devil, he had got a man's heart, and was
taught Ch. 4. v. 37. to honour and <hi>extoll the King of
Heaven, all whose works are Truth, and his ways Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and who is able to abase all those that walk in
Pride. What can be more significant of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>'s
Case than this? Which therefore is a most
certain character that the First Beast is the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Monarchy, and this passage is most properly
applied to him.</p>
            <p>But withall I do not deny but it may be extended
further to other Cases of the Empire, or Monarchs
of <hi>Babylon;</hi> accordingly as <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds the
plucking of the Wings of this Lion, <hi>Tardati cursus ejus
Imperii,</hi> &amp;c. The affairs of that Empire were not
carried on with that speed and success under <hi>Evil-Merodac</hi>
and his Vice-roy, as it were, <hi>Naragalrazar,</hi>
in whose days <hi>Cyrus</hi> rebelling against <hi>Astyages</hi>
(whom <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had set over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Media</hi> insomuch that <hi>Media</hi> was under the
<hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire in the Reign of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
and onward till this rebellion of <hi>Cyrus) Media</hi> by this
means in <hi>Evil-Merodac</hi>'s days Son of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
was rent from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire. And this, I
think, was a considerable clipping or plucking the
Wings of the Lion, besides what other particularities
might be noted in History. And moreover <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi>
Ch. 5. (as <hi>Daniel</hi> reproves him for his not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
that fearfull punishment of his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For his pride had lifted him up also against the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59418:68"/>
Lord of Heaven, v. 23. and he had quaffed in the
holy Vessels of God's Temple in that impious Feast
he made) <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> I say, was pretty well hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by that hand-writing against him on the Wall,
but immediately after was laid in the dust of death.
But in his Successor <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> (for I above no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that the succession is accounted as one continued
Monarch, as the Beast one continued Empire, and
what belongs to the Monarch or Empire is said of
this First Beast) the other part of the Prophecy is
again fulfilled, <hi>That he was made to stand upon his
feet as a man,</hi> not to soar in the Air with Eagles
Wings, and phancy himself above him that dwells
in the Clouds. <hi>And a man's heart was given to him,</hi>
namely, to <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> *  the last Monarch of the
<hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire. (For all begin the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi>
Empire from <hi>Cyrus.)</hi> And what a heart full of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
towards <hi>Daniel,</hi> nay indeed of Piety and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s God, the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, will plainly appear to any that reads the Sixth
Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ver. 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 23, 26, 27.
Thus fully well assured may we be that this First
Beast is the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire, and this being given
we shall easily be induced to believe that the Three
following will prove the <hi>Medo-Persian, Greek,</hi> and
<hi>Roman,</hi> as they were in the Image of the Four Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
for the same reasons there above specified.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>And behold another Beas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

of Prophecies, must be the <hi>Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>-Persian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
So that there is less need to take notice what
Interpreters have observed of congruity, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Bear the Symbol of the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59418:69"/>
As that <hi>Persia</hi> is notorious for the breeding
the fiercer sort, as well as plenty of those Animals:
That what is most notorious in the Bear, that he can
live on little or no meat for a long time, is likewise
significative of the great abstinence and hardhip of
the <hi>Persians,</hi> and what a mean diet they use to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
themselves with, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> has taken notice
in his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the like. Upon which
it is less necessary to insist; there being further cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of this Empire in the Text it self. <hi>And it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
up it self on one side,</hi> that is, It rear'd up it self
to fight against only one party of men, namely, the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> as if we should conceive the World divided
into Two parts, <hi>Iewes</hi> or the People of God, and
<hi>Gentiles.</hi> The sense is, he medled not with the <hi>Iews</hi>
(but favoured them, as is notorious from the Decrees
of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and of others his Successors in the behalf of
the <hi>Iews,)</hi> but only with the Heathen party. It is
also <hi>Grotius</hi> his gloss, <hi>Iudaeae nihil nocuit,</hi> which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
he confirms from the authority of S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>
who professes he follows the <hi>Iews</hi> therein, and
the thing is abundantly reasonable in itself. Whence
it is a plain Characteristick of this Empire of <hi>Cyrus</hi>
and his Successors, that were kind to the <hi>Iews.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Ch. 44. 28. <hi>That saith of</hi>
Cyrus <hi>he is my Shepherd, and shall perform all my
pleasure; even saying to Ierusalem, Thou shalt be built,
and to the Temple, Thy Foundation shall be laid. <hi>And
it had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </hi> These Three Ribs, says <hi>Grotius,</hi> are
<hi>Persia, Media</hi> and <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> which were Three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
parts of the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Empire, (and Ribs
signifie the Strength of a man according to <hi>Achmetes,)</hi>
and others agree with <hi>Grotius</hi> herein. But some by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59418:69"/>
these Three Ribs would have understood Three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Coasts of the World subdued by the <hi>Medo-Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian

And they said unto it, Arise, dedour much

an Instigation from Heaven, or as he says in
<hi>Virgil,</hi>
               <q>—Sua cuique Deus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

the cruel and bloudy Feats in the mean time of the
<hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Monarchs are here signified, whether
they were stirred up as a scourge to the wicked
World, or their own ambition prick'd them on to
make a prey of so many Countries, and to make a
spoil of their riches, which by <hi>Flesh</hi> are understood
in the <hi>Onirocriticks.</hi> Which therefore seems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the spoil of the more civilized parts of the
World which were grown rich and luxurious. In
the mean time, besides the order of reckoning, there
are indications enough from the Characters of this
Empire it self, that it must be the <hi>Medo-Persian.</hi>
But the most substantial is, that it succeeds the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>After this I beheld, and to another like a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard.</hi>
Succession here again is enough to assure us
that this is the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, because the <hi>Medo-Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
was put an end to by <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with his Armies were so swift, that in this regard
a Leopard is a fit symbol of this Empire, that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
besides the extraordinary velocity of it, jumping
upon his prey, as Naturalists observe. And there
was a wonderfull dispatch and celerity in <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
Conquests, who in the space of Six years subdued
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59418:70"/>
not only all <hi>Asia,</hi> but a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick.</hi>
The variety of the Spots of that Animal, <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
will have to set out the diversity or uncertainty
of the Genius of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the First Founder of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Empire, as being one strangely variegated with
notable Vertues and notable Vices, giving a specimen
now of one, and then of another in no small degree,
and that of those very contrary. And that his body
had a sweet and pleasant smell, as the Leopard is
reported to have, and very gratefull to other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and that the Leopard as well as <hi>Alexander</hi>
loves Wine. These things also are noted by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
which makes the Leopard still a more fit
symbol of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire. Some also think that
the levity, uncertainty, and fallaciousness of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Nation is perstringed in the diversity of Spots in the
Leopard's Skin. But what follows in the Text will
sufficiently confirm to us that this Third Beast is the
<hi>Greek</hi> Empire. <hi>Which had upon the back of it Four
Wings of a Fowl.</hi> These Wings in the general
signification of them assuredly denote the celerity of
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s Conquests, as they are <hi>Wings;</hi> but as
<hi>Four,</hi> they betoken the division of his Empire into
Four parts after his death, or into Four Kingdoms:
as also what follows denotes the Four several suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
of Kings in those Kingdoms. <hi>The Beast had
also Four Heads.</hi> As the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by a Beast with <hi>Ten Horns,</hi> because it was to
be divided into Ten Kingdoms at last, so this Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard
is represented with <hi>Four Heads,</hi> because after
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s Death, the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire was to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into Four Kingdoms; <hi>Philippus Aridaeus</hi> the
Brother of <hi>Alexander,</hi> or rather <hi>Cassander,</hi> enjoying
the Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia</hi> (for <hi>Aridaeus</hi> Reigned not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59418:70"/>
passing Seven months) <hi>Ptolemaeus Lagi</hi> Fil. the
Kingdom of <hi>Aegupt</hi> and <hi>Africk; Lysimachus</hi> the
Kingdom of <hi>Thracia,</hi> and <hi>Antigonus</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Asia minor.</hi> Than which what can be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for a more certain Character of the <hi>Greek</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
or a surer Argument that the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire did
not expire with <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Death, but was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the successions of those Four Kingdoms so
long as they lasted, and till some other Empire may
rationally be thought to put an end to their compute,
as when <hi>Aemylius Paulus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Consul van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
<hi>Perseus,</hi> the last King of <hi>Macedonia?</hi> Which
gave in a special manner the denomination to the
<hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Macedonick</hi> Empire. <hi>And Dominion was
given unto it. <hi>Alexander</hi>
               </hi>'s Conquests were so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
marvellous, and so extremely overpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
to the number of his Soldiers, and the space
of time he atchieved them in, that a man may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
think that [Dominion being <hi>given</hi> to him,]
may have a more peculiar meaning here than in other
places. As if the Empire he is said to acquire was
* rather a meer gift of Divine Providence than any
Acquist by his own strength, policy, or vigilancy.
For what was his Thirty thousand men, when he
was to conflict, one while with an Hundred and fifty
thousand, anon with Four hundred thousand, and
at last with near Ten hundred thousand, <hi>Darius
Codomannus</hi> bringing so many into the Field against
him? And when notice was given to him by his
Captains, he was found in such a dead sleep, that
they could hardly awaken him, and yet he had scarce
rub'd his eyes, as <hi>Calvin</hi> expresses the dispatch of
his Victory, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Darius</hi> fled, his Army was routed,
and Forty thousand of his men slain with the loss of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59418:71"/>
less than Three hundred of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as <hi>Quintus Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
relates. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Expression here is indeed Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical,
But for the main the Characteristicks of
this Third Empire are so remarkable and notorious,
that he must be very bad sighted that does not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive the said Empire to be the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>After this I saw in the night Uisions.</hi> In this
Divine or supernatural Dream communicated to me
from God. <hi>And behold a Fourth Beast,</hi> that is, A
Fourth Empire, and particularly the <hi>Roman.</hi> For
what Empire should succeed the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Macedonick</hi>
Empire but the <hi>Roman</hi> that vanquished it, as the
<hi>Greek</hi> the <hi>Persian,</hi> and the <hi>Persian</hi> the <hi>Babylonian?</hi>
That this Fourth Beast or Fourth Empire is the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire, I have so fully and evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
against <hi>Grotius,</hi> in my <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi>
Book 2. Ch. 13. that no rational man, I think, if
he read considerately what I have written, can ever
for the future doubt thereof. And how suitable the
description is in the Vision all along, we shall now
see. <hi>Dreadfull and terrible, and strong excéeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and it had great Iron téeth.</hi> As this Fourth King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is also represented in the Vision of the Image by
the Iron Legs thereof, to which you may also refer
that it is said here to be strong exceedingly. For so
is that Metal. And the courage, cruelty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
largeness of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire must needs
make it <hi>dreadfull and terrible.</hi> Which some conceive
it to have been in so great a measure, as no one wild

cruelty thereof. Amongst oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

is astonishing and ineffable, and exceeding the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageness
of any wild Beast whatsoever, that we may
not want a reason why this Fourth Beast is without
Name. <hi>It devoured and brake in pieces, and stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

others Lands or Revenues to them, they tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
upon those whom they could not so perfectly

<hi>Illa igitur astuta liberalitas,</hi> says <hi>Calvin, vocatur con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcatio,

&amp; absumere suis dentibus, pedibus suis calcarent.</hi>
See <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place. <hi>And it was diverse from
all the Beasts that went before it.</hi> Forasmuch as
they being absolute Monarchies, this Fourth Beast
consisted of Two Consuls and a Senate, (Dictators
also were sometimes chosen,) and in after times
of a Mingle-mangle of Popes and Emperors, <hi>&amp;c. And
it had Ten Horns,</hi> answering to the <hi>Ten Toes</hi> of the
Iron Legs of the Image, that is to say, This <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire was at last divided into Ten Kingdoms, as the
<hi>Greek</hi> Empire was into Four. That these Ten Horns
belong to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>Grotius</hi> himself is fain
to acknowledge in his Commentary on the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse.</hi>
though with might and main he endeavours
to distort and obscure the sense of that Book to the
utmost he can. But by Virtue of the Apocalyptick
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59418:72"/>
Synchronisms, and the clear and undeniable sense of
the Seventeenth Chapter of that Book, these Ten
Horns must be the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire divided into Ten
Kingdoms after the Empire became Christian, and
was beginning to <hi>Pagano-Christianize</hi> and grow Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
again. <hi>This</hi> therefore is the time, and <hi>there</hi>
the Ten Horns of the Beast.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>I considered the Horns.</hi> Which is said by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
to excite us to a close consideration of these Horns
to see what we can espy there. <hi>And behold there
came up among them another little Horn.</hi> And this
more especially was the object of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s, and ought
to be of our consideration, what this <hi>little Horn,</hi>
that is said to be <hi>another</hi> Horn, (among them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
but <hi>distinct</hi> from them) may mean. This <hi>little
Horn</hi> therefore is an <hi>Additional</hi> to the <hi>Ten Horns</hi>
here, as the <hi>Two-horned</hi> Beast and the <hi>Whore</hi> are <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionals</hi>
to the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beast, <hi>Apoc. Ch.</hi> 13. and
 7. Which most peculiarly is the <hi>Papal Polity</hi> or
Hierarchy. Now let us see how this suits with the
Text. <hi>Before whom there were thrée of the First,</hi>
namely, of the First Kind, and First mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
Secular, <hi>Horns pluck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi>
his Translation has it out of the Chaldee, <hi>Tria au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem

Whereby is signified only the removal <hi>from before his
Face,</hi> they stood in his light it seems. Whereas they
would have or had fixed themselves so near him to
his prejudice, he made shift to get them pull'd away.
But this you must conceive could not be till the Pope
had ascended unto that rampancy of Power, that he
would excommunicate Emperours, and depose them
if need were, or absolve their Subjects from Allegiance
and seize their Lands. In which time the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59418:72"/>
the Monarch as it were of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
the Emperours so called whether <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
may well take their places among the Ten
Horns, especially the Secular Empire of old <hi>Rome</hi>
being dissolved, which gave the Name or Title to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as <hi>Macedonia</hi> did to the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donick</hi>
Empire. This premised, what Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>
says on this Text is very agreeable, That the
Three Horns pulled away from before the little
Horn is the power extending into <hi>Italy,</hi> of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Emperours, of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and of the
<hi>Franks</hi> continued in the Empire of <hi>Germany.</hi> All
these Three Powers or Horns he made shift to rid
himself of, that he might the more easily domineer
in <hi>Italy</hi> without any Corrival, as is sufficiently made
out by History. <hi>And behold in this Horn were eyes
like the eyes of a man.</hi> This is another main ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
in this <hi>little Horn,</hi> that it had <hi>eyes,</hi> when
none of the rest are said to have so. Which is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
difference, and hugely significant of a Power
that will pretend to lead all the rest of the Horns, as
being themselves <hi>destitute</hi> of <hi>sight.</hi> And the <hi>Papal Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy</hi>
how cunning and quick-sighted a Polity it has
been all Histories ring of it, and how far they pretend
and how active Assistants they are, even in Civil Affairs.</p>
            <p>But I conceive this does not exhaust all the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these <hi>eyes</hi> in the <hi>little Horn,</hi> and of the other
Horns <hi>having none.</hi> Which may more peculiarly
represent the difference betwixt this <hi>Hierarchical</hi>
Power in the Empire, and the <hi>Secular</hi> of the <hi>Ten
Kings,</hi> who in matters of Faith and Religion are to
have <hi>no eyes</hi> of their own, but to profess and believe
as <hi>this Horn</hi> who pretends to have the <hi>only eyes</hi> tells
them, and to be led in a blind implicit Faith and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59418:73"/>
Profession of whatsoever this <hi>seeing Horn</hi> declares to
be Articles of the Christian Religion, and requisite
to salvation. And this <hi>little Horn</hi> having this hank
upon them, you may be sure will require them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
such things as tend most for the greatness,
power, and riches of the <hi>Papal Hierarchy.</hi> And all
the gross and intolerable corruptions of their Church,
whether touching <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> are invented
or upheld for this very end, and upon this very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that the <hi>little Horn</hi> is thought only to have
the <hi>eyes</hi> in matters of Faith and Religion, but the
other Ten Horns to be stark blind.</p>
            <p>But lastly, though this little Horn pretends to the
only <hi>sight</hi> and <hi>infallibility</hi> in matters of Religion, as
if it were inspired so from God that it cannot erre;
yet the very character which the Prophecy gives it,
doth advertise us, that this is but a bold boast among
the rest, and that these are really but the <hi>eyes</hi> of a
<hi>man,</hi> even of that <hi>man of Sin</hi> or <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts
himself above all that is called God, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.</p>
            <p>For that by this little Horn <hi>Antichrist</hi> is Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized,
is the common and current Opinion of the
Ancient Fathers, as the <hi>Romish</hi> Interpreters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cannot but confess, though they were mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the time of his coming. <hi>And a Mouth speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great things;</hi> that is, Uttering great boasts of
his own <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Infallibility.</hi> For this <hi>Papal Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy</hi>
pretend him, as to Superiority, to be above
all Kings and Emperours, as to their miraculous
Power, that they can by certain words turn a piece
of Bread into a man, with Flesh and Bloud, and all
Essentials of humane nature, nay, into God after
a manner, and infallibly declare, 'tis no Idolatry to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59418:73"/>
worship this thus transubstantiated Bread, though
it seem still Bread to all, and is believed still to be so
by all, but by those that see only by the <hi>eyes</hi> of this
<hi>little Horn,</hi> and so trust his Eyes only, and renounce
in the mean time the use of their own Eyes and all
their Senses, nay, of Reason, and the plain Light of
the Scripture. Their pretence also of consecrating
Images to the effectually keeping off Thunder and
Lightning, and incursion of the Enemies, and the like,
may be reckoned amongst other their Boasts. But
this speaking great things may more especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the great vaunts of the <hi>Papal authoritative</hi>
Power, he being called by the Pontifician Polity, Our
Lord God, <hi>Optimum Maximum &amp; Supremum Numen
in Terris,</hi> The Supreme Deity on Earth: It being
declared by them, That his Tribunal and God's is
all one. That his Power is absolute. That what he
does he does as God and not as Man. That he is all
and above all. That he has the disposing of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
can pull down one and set up another. That
he can do all that God can do. That he can change
the Nature of things, make something of nothing,
make Injustice Justice, and Wrong Right. That all
Laws are in his Breast. That he can dispense with
the Canons of the Apostles, and with the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
itself. That he is the Cause of Causes. That it is
Sacriledge to doubt of his Power. That he has do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over Angels, Purgatory and Hell. That he
is the Monarch of the World, and exceeds the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Majesty as much as the Sun does the Moon. And,
That he is to be adored by all the Potentates of the
Earth. This and more than this you may see made
good by Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> in his Treatise <hi>De Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christo,</hi>
for above Fifty Pages together. And is not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59418:74"/>
this a mouth speaking great things indeed? And is not
this part of the Prophecy also eximiously fulfilled,
understanding by the <hi>little Horn</hi> that Man of Sin or
Antichrist, that thus exalts himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> above all that is
called God or worshipped, whom the Lord shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
with the Spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy
with the brightness of his coming? Which thing is
exhibited in the following part of the Vision.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>I beheld till the Chrones were cast down.</hi>
The word in the original might as well be rendred,
<hi>set down</hi> or <hi>erected,</hi> which is the most natural Sense
and most conherent with what follows, <hi>And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
of Days did sit,</hi> * namely, God the Father,
who though he is not before the other Two Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postases
of the Blessed Trinity in <hi>time,</hi> yet he is in
<hi>order of nature.</hi> He sate in his Throne together with
the chiefest of the Angelical Orders in their Thrones
or Seats, to make up the solemnity of the Judgment.
<hi>Whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>arment was white as snow, and the hair
of his Head like the pure wooll.</hi> Whiteness here
by Interpreters is look'd upon, that of his Head as
an Emblem of mature Counsel and Judgment with a
sutableness to his Title of the <hi>Ancient of Days,</hi> that
of his Garment as a Symbol of pure unspotted Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and Impartiality in Judgment. And this
appearance of this first <hi>Hypostasis</hi> in general in White,
may denote the proper Character of his Nature.
Which the <hi>Platonists</hi> call the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which imply an ineffable Simplicity and Benignity,
and who would not have the world judged by such a
Judge? <hi>His Chrone was like the fiery Flame, and
his Whéels like the burning Fire. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> Such was
the splendour of his Throne and of the Wheels there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
bright, sparkling, and shining like Fire and Light.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59418:74"/>
This is a Description of the <hi>Divine Shechinah,</hi> not
much unlike that in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Ch. 1. and 10. This
is a <hi>Chariot-like</hi> Throne as that a <hi>Throne-like</hi> Chariot;
and as the Wheels there as well as living Creatures are
Angelical, so there are Angels here innumerable in
this great Session sitting with the Ancient of Days,
or assisting, while he sits in his Imperial Throne
drawn with Wheels, Angelical Wheels, by whose
Ministry is the Revolution of all States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms:
Though in the mean time there may be also
an allusion in these Wheels to the <hi>Sellae Curules,</hi> Chairs
of State that ran upon Wheels, in use in the days of old.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>A Fiery stream issued and came forth from
before him. <hi>Flumen igneum manabat ab ore ejus egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diens,</hi>
               </hi>
so <hi>Grotius</hi> says it is, <hi>in Chaldaeo.</hi> A Fiery
stream issued out of his mouth. The brightness of
this appearance, and the mention of this Fiery stream
coming out of his mouth, (like that blast of Fire and
flaming Breath, 2 <hi>Esdr.</hi> 13.) sutes excellently well
with that passage 2 <hi>Thess. 2. Whom the Lord shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
with the Spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy
with the brightness of his coming.</hi> Which shall be by
the clear demonstration of the power of his Spirit so
manifestly appearing in his true Church, of whom
Jesus Christ is and ever has been the living Head,
the same which is the Son of man which is anon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
in this Vision, namely, Christ, together with
his true and living Church. But in the mean time I
leave to the ingenious Readers consideration, whether
that Fiery stream and Flaming breath coming out of the
mouth of the Ancient of Days, God the Father, may
not emblematize the Procession of the Holy Ghost,
the third Hypostasis of the Holy Trinity, as well as
the Son of man plainly represents to us the Second.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59418:75"/>
For who can doubt but that it is a representation of
Christ, the humane nature of the <hi>Messias</hi> united with
the Eternal <hi>Logos,</hi> and according to his Divinity every
where existing in the Father, as well as according to
his Humanity he is here represented distinctly from
him? <hi>Thousand thousands ministred unto him, and
Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.</hi>
This Judgment of the little Horn is so magnificently
set out as if it were the last Judgment of all, and I do
not doubt but that it alludes to it, and touches upon
it in the following words. <hi>The Iudgment was set
and the Books were opened.</hi> This sitting of the
Judgment corresponds with that <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. 11, 12.
Where there is a White Throne and the Books are
opened, and this is at the Final Judgment, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Resurrection, immediately preceeding the <hi>Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration,</hi>
which in another sense this Fiery description
here in <hi>Daniel</hi> sutes very well with, and then the
Fiery stream out of the mouth of the Ancient of Days
will presignifie that final Sentence, <hi>Depart from me
ye accursed into everlasting Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Ver. 4. of the same Chapter,<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.</note> 
               <hi>And I saw Thrones
and they sat upon them,</hi> &amp;c. This answers to the ninth
Verse of this seventh of <hi>Daniel, And I beheld till
the Thrones were set.</hi> For these Thrones are set to
judge the little Horn, the same with the <hi>Whore</hi> or
<hi>False Prophet,</hi> which is said, together with the <hi>Beast,
Apoc.</hi> 19. to be taken and cast both alive into a Lake
of Fire burning with Brimstone, which is to come to
pass under the Seventh Vial; which immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the coming down of the New <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
the Reign of the Saints. Here is onely the difference
betwixt these Two Sessions, that the Apocalyptick
Session mentions only the Reign of the Saints, this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59418:75"/>
the instant dooming and executing the Doom of the
little Horn in order thereto, and the giving the Son
of man the Kingdom. But being that <hi>Corruptio unius</hi>
is <hi>Generatio alterius,</hi> and the things are so closely
connected, we may very well admit that these Two
preceding Sessions or Sentences declared therein, have
a considerable correspondence one with another, that
in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> manifestly belonging to this part
of this Judgment here in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that gives the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to the Son of man. So that so far the correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is palpable.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>I beheld then because of the voice of the great
words which the Horn spake;</hi> namely, Such bluster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and boastfull words as were recited above upon
Ver. 8. to see what would become of this Horn that
so magnified himself above all. and had acted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
in deposing Kings and trampling upon the
Necks of Emperours, and murthering, massacring
and burning God knows how many Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of innocent Christians for not submitting to his
Tyranny and Idolatry. <hi>I beheld even till the Beast
was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the
burning Flame.</hi> What then, is the Beast destroyed
and the little Horn escape punishment? This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is a very compendious and Elliptical Form of
Speech. But the Sense is fully made out by S. <hi>Iohn
Apoc.</hi> 19. 20. For it is impossible but the little Horn
must be concerned in that destruction of the Beast,
himself being the Two-horned Beast in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi>
Chap. 13. but in<note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 19.</note> this Chapter stiled the <hi>False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
for his false pretence to Infallibility. <hi>And the
Beast was taken,</hi> says he, <hi>and with him the False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
that wrought Miracles before him,</hi> that is, who
transubstantiated Bread into a Man, and brought
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59418:76"/>
Fire from Heaven, and had power over Purgatory
and Hell, thither to strike innocent Souls by his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
Excommunications. <hi>These both were cast
alive into a Lake of Fire burning with Brimstone.</hi> And
thus the Fourth Empire, the <hi>Roman,</hi> as to its Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Tyranny, of which the Pope makes himself
the Head, as his Canonists and Theologers declare,
is quite demolished under the Seventh Vial.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>As concerning the rest of the Beasts they had
their Dominion taken away;</hi> that is, And if any
one shall be so curious as to enquire what became of
the rest of the Beasts, the other Three above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
let that suffice that their Dominion was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away; and that, <hi>Yet their lives were prolonged
for a season and time;</hi> they had their certain periods
allowed them too, by the Doom of the Ancient of
Days. This is enough as touching them, but the
great business of all is touching the Fourth Beast, the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire; forasmuch as the true Church of
Christ for so long a space of time is so much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
therein, and therefore that deserves more special
observation and enlargment. The Affairs of the <hi>Iews</hi>
under the Three first Beasts are not considerable, in
respect of these of the Christians. And therefore the
Three first Beasts in this Vision seem to be brought
in meerly as a preamble to the Fourth; and the
Fourth with the Three first to be first described, as
being of one sute, namely, Idolatrous. But then
there is a Fifth Kingdom which is Christ with his true
Church commencing in the Apostles times, and
lasting till the end of the World. Of which in the
following Verse.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>I saw in the night Uisions,</hi> in this Divine
Dream as was above-said, <hi>And behold, one like the Son
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59418:76"/>
of man. <hi>The Son of man</hi>
               </hi> is a Title which Christ so
inculcatedly assumes to himself, to whom the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
does belong, that it is impossible but he should
have a regard to this very place, in the so perpetually
using that style touching himself. And therefore it
being Christ, it is plain that the second Hypostasis
of the Holy Trinity is here exhibited in this Divine
Vision as well as the first and third, as I have noted,
they all Three are in the Vision of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> This
Title of Christ, <hi>the Son of man,</hi> occurrs in innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
places. I need name none. And yet there is
one I will not omit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 64. When the High
Priest had adjured him to tell him if he was Christ
the Son of God, <hi>Iesus saith unto him, Thou hast said.
Nevertheless I say unto thee,</hi> (though thou hast hit it
already, yet I will give thee a further confirmation
thereof,) <hi>Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting
on the right hand of Power, and coming in the Clouds
of Heaven;</hi> namely, as it were at the head of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Army, to take vengeance of the murtherous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
<hi>Iews,</hi> I say, the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, out of which
People especially he was to raise to himself his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the Church. Which yet was but <hi>Regnum Lapidis,</hi>
as I noted in the foregoing Vision, but would be in
time <hi>Regnum Montis. <hi>Came with the Clouds of
Heaven.</hi>
               </hi> To be carried with the Clouds of Heaven,
denotes that a King shall be master of his Enemies,
and get glorious Victory, saith <hi>Achmetes.</hi> And the
destruction of the <hi>Iews</hi> was the establishing of the
Church of Christ, or his Kingdom among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
the <hi>Romans</hi> especially, whose Empire became
at last Christian. <hi>And came to the Ancient of Days,
and they brought him near before him,</hi> presented him
as a Candidate for the designed Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59418:77"/>14. <hi>And there was given him Dominion and Glory,
and a Kingdom, that all People, and Nations, and
Languages should serve him;</hi> that is, That some of
all People should serve him in the pure Apostolick way
of Doctrine and Worship; and indeed the whole <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire in a manner did so for a while after <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>'s
time, till the Apostasie came in. Which
small Interval of time in this Vision is not taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, as being inconsiderable. But in the mean
time it may be here seasonable to note, that this
Right of the Kingdom being given to the Son of man,
answers to the first Vision of the <hi>Seals,</hi> the Vision of
the <hi>Heros on the white Horse,</hi> with a <hi>bow</hi> in his
hand, and who had a <hi>Crown given unto him, Apoc.</hi> 6. 2.
the right of the Imperial Crown. So that this part
of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Vision here commences with the Epocha
of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> or the beginning of Christianity.
For there seems Four Sentences to have been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in this <hi>Iudicial</hi> Session of the Ancient of Days,
(besides that touching the Three Beasts, Ver. 12.)
one assigning the Kingdom in general to the Son of
man, the other, the Judgment of the little Horn;
the third, the giving of the more inlarged Kingdom
to the Son of man upon the destruction of the little
Horn; and the fourth, the final Doom of all, at the
day of Judgment properly so called. But the first
and the last there is only a slight perstriction or brief
intimation of them, but that of the little Horn is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, the abolishing of his power, and the giving
the great enlargement of the Kingdom, the <hi>Regnum
Montis,</hi> to the Saints of the most High. <hi>His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
is an everlasting Dominion which shall not
pass away, and his Kingdom that which shall not
be destroyed.</hi> The true Church which is the genuine
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59418:77"/>
Kingdom of Christ, and of which he alone is the
Head as being Universal, never yet from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereof has failed, nor ever will fail to the end
of the World.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>I Daniel was grieved in my Spirit, in the
midst of my body, and the Uisions of my head,</hi> upon
my Bed, <hi>troubled me;</hi> that is, I was very anxious
to know what the meaning of this Vision might be.
And methought,</p>
            <p>16. <hi>I came near to one of them that stood by;</hi>
to one of the Assistant Angels in this great Session,
not to those that were placed on Thrones. <hi>And
asked him the truth of all this;</hi> that is, The plain
meaning of this Prophetick Parable. <hi>So he told me,
and made me know the Interpretation of things;</hi>
namely, as follows; and first in general.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>These great Beasts which are Four, are Four
Kings</hi> (with their Kingdoms or Empires, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman,) <hi>which
shall arise out of the Earth.</hi>
               </hi> And therefore be but
Earthly Kingdoms, minding Earthly Things here
below.</p>
            <p>18. <hi>But the Saints of the most High;</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
of the most High God, or of Christ; who
is called in the <hi>Apocalypse, King of Kings, and Lord
of Lords. <hi>Shall take the Kingdom,</hi>
               </hi> of the Stone,
<hi>Regnum Lapidis,</hi> from the first planting of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
but <hi>Regnum Montis,</hi> the Kingdom of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
upon the destruction of the little Horn. <hi>And
possess the Kingdom for ever, even for ever and
ever;</hi> that is, The true Church of Christ shall never
fail till the end of the World, as was intimated above.
And thus far in general touching the Vision, but he
holds on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59418:78"/>19. <hi>Then I would know the truth,</hi> the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>of the Fourth Beast which was divers from all
others.</hi> And in what regard we have above decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

which this Horn the Papal Power pretends to have
a right to dispense with and act contrary to, and
against the right of Kings and Emperours, whom he
pretends a Power of excommunicating and deposing,
and absolving their Subjects from their Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,

That is, that has a bold assured look, affecting

his Chair when he will be carried in State, to hold
the Bason and Towel when he washes his hands, and
in publick Assemblies to sit at his Feet, and if they
will not be dutifull enough, to be trod upon by his
Feet, as <hi>Frederick Barbarossa</hi> was served by Pope
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, who treading upon his Neck
<hi>in conspectu populi,</hi> with a bigg look and loud voice,
abused that of the Psalmist to his barbarous insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
over the Emperour, <hi>Super aspidem &amp; leonem
ambulabis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou shalt tread upon the Lion and
Adder,</hi> &amp;c. These hints are enough to shew how
fully this part of the Prophecy is accomplished [whose
look was more <hi>stout</hi> than his Fellows.]</p>
            <p>21. <hi>I beheld, and the same Horn</hi> (namely, the
little Horn) <hi>made war with the Saints and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
against them;</hi> that is, The Papal Power by
using the forces of the Ten Horns or Secular Power
makes war against the Saints, the true Apostolick
Church, that stand out and cannot admit the gross
corruptions and Idolatrous usages of the little Horn.
This answers to that of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> Ch. 13. v. 7.
<hi>And it was given unto him to make war with the Saints,
and to overcome them.</hi> It is spoken there of the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned
Beast</hi> as the Executioner of the War, but in
<hi>Daniel</hi> of the <hi>little Horn,</hi> as the Instigator or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizer
of the War. But this in the mean time is no small
indication, that the times of the <hi>little Horn</hi> belong to
the times of the <hi>Ten-horned Beast healed;</hi> which are
the times of the Apostasie of the Church.</p>
            <p>22. <hi>Until the Ancient of Days came. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> Till
he proceeded to that part of the Doom that pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Sentence against the little Horn. <hi>And Iudgment
was given to the Saints of the most High;</hi> that is,
The Sentence was pronounced on their side, God
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59418:79"/>
so generally convincing the World of the truth of
their cause. <hi>And the time came that the Saints
possessed the Kingdom;</hi> namely, After the evidence
of the truth of their Cause was so well known to the
World.</p>
            <p>23. <hi>Thus he said, The Fourth Beast shall be the
Fourth Kingdom upon Earth;</hi> namely, the <hi>Roman</hi>
State or Empire. <hi>Which shall be divers from all
Kingdoms,</hi> as having a Political constitution dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from them, as has been noted above. The
vulgar Latin, the Septuagint, and <hi>Vatablus,</hi> as also
<hi>Gasper Sanctius</hi> read, <hi>Which shall be greater than all
Kingdoms,</hi> namely, than those Three before named.
Which therefore cannot be the Kingdom of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidae</hi>
and <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> would have it, if that
reading obtain. And it has the start of the other for
Antiquity. <hi>And shall devour the whole Earth, and
shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</hi> Which
sutes best of all with the sense of <hi>Vatablus,</hi> the vulgar
Latin, and the Septuagint. For the greatest King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was the most able to do this.</p>
            <p>24. <hi>And the Ten Horns out of this Kingdom are
the Ten Kings that shall arise.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
Ver. 7. is described under one Interval of its
period to have Ten Horns, so that it is the same Ten-horned
Beast that occurs in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> And,
Ver. 8. it is said that there came up among them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
little Horn, which naturally implies that it came
up much about the same time with them, though in
what here follows it is said, <hi>And another shall arise
after them.</hi> Which is no contradiction to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
supposing in order he came up last, so be it was
not any considerable time after, or be understood of
his more sensible growth or palpable appearance;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59418:79"/>
though the Hebrew word implies no necessity of sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
any posteriority of time, but that he might
spring up with them and amongst them, but in such
an occult manner, and so unawares, as if he had stoln
his growth behind them. For so the Septuagint ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the word in the Original
will bear that sense very well, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
order of place as well as of time, accordingly as
the Septuagint have translated it. But the time of
the Ten-horned healed Beast being the time of the
Apostasie of the Church, and he being actually Ten-horned
and healed at the same time, (For the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Ten Horns which shew their actual Reign, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
only on the healed Beast's head, as I have noted
in my Exposition of the <hi>Apocalypse,)</hi> and the <hi>little
Horn</hi> being said to arise among them or with them,
though the other Horns were not aware of him, as
having <hi>no Eyes,</hi> though the <hi>little Horn</hi> have the <hi>Eyes
of a man,</hi> of a cunning perspicacious Politician; it is
manifest that the growth of the little Horn began
with the Apostasie of the Church, and so the little
Horn may well be suspected of helping it on, being
most concerned in matters of Religion to manage
them well or ill, as being that <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Polity or
<hi>Hierarchy,</hi> as is intimated in what follows. <hi>And he
shall be divers from the First,</hi> namely, from the
other Ten Horns, they being <hi>Laick</hi> or <hi>Civil,</hi> this
<hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> or <hi>Spiritual,</hi> for such was the Papal
Power. <hi>And,</hi> under pretence of this Ecclesiastick
Power, <hi>he shall subdue Thrée Kings.</hi> The Three
Kings which he is said to humble, subdue, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant,
are, as I have hinted above, those Three whose
Dominions extended into <hi>Italy,</hi> as that of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Emperour <hi>Leo Isaurus,</hi> whom he excommunicated,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59418:80"/>
and made his Subjects of <hi>Italy</hi> revolt from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
because he was against Image-wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>hip. The
other supplanting or subduing is of the <hi>Longobards,</hi>
whose Kingdom he caused, by aid of the <hi>Franks,</hi> to
be wholly ruined thereby, to get the Exarchate of
<hi>Ravenna,</hi> (which since the revolt from the <hi>Greeks</hi>
the <hi>Longobards</hi> were seized on) for a Patrimony to
S. <hi>Peter.</hi> And the last of the Three which he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
were the Emperours of <hi>Germany,</hi> whom from
the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, he excommunicated,
deposed, and trampled under his Feet, and never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to live in rest till he had made them quit their
interest in election of Popes, and Investitures of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and what-ever remainder of Jurisdiction they
had in <hi>Italy.</hi> See Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Epist. 24. Thus did
this <hi>Horn</hi> with <hi>Eyes,</hi> whose <hi>look</hi> was more <hi>stout</hi> than
his Fellows.</p>
            <p>25. <hi>And he,</hi> namely, the little Horn, <hi>shall speak

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> against the most High.</hi> It is rightly
translated, <hi>great words,</hi> because that Phrase touching
the little Horn has been used so oft already, Ver. 8.
11. 20. Where either <hi>great things</hi> or <hi>great words</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
and there cannot be a more fit and authentick
commentary on these passages than that in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,</hi>
Ch. 13. v. 5, 6. <hi>And there was given unto him
a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies;</hi> where
<hi>great things</hi> are expounded by <hi>blasphemies.</hi> And in
the following Verse he shews how these blasphemies
are against <hi>God the most High,</hi> many examples
whereof I have given above upon Verse 8. <hi>And he
opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme
his Name,</hi> his authority and titles, <hi>and his tabernacle,
and them that dwell in Heaven.</hi> The Ten-horned
Beast is said here to reproach them by allowing, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59418:80"/>
and inforcing (against the decrees and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God, which is also a blaspheming of his
Name,) those blasphemous decrees of the <hi>Two horned</hi>
Beast, (which is the same with the <hi>little Horn,</hi> they
being both the <hi>Papal</hi> Polity or Hierarchy, the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick</hi>
Authority not the <hi>Laick</hi> or <hi>Secular,)</hi> for Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship,
for Saint-worship, and worship of Angels,
and for Transubstantiation, which is a reproach to
the Tabernacle of God, the body of Christ; see the
place in my <hi>Exposition of the Apocalypse.</hi> It is
sufficient here to note how well the deeds of the <hi>little
Horn</hi> sute with those of the <hi>Ten-horned Healed Beast,</hi>
who is but the Abettor and Executioner of what the
Two-horned Beast would have. And therefore when
it is said the <hi>little Horn</hi> here speaks great words against
the most High, it is all one as if it were said of the
<hi>Ten-horned Beast</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> nor is it any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
to understand it of them both. For this
which is said of the Ten-horned Beast is to be lookt
upon as the meer Echo of the Draconick voice of the
Beast with <hi>Two Horns.</hi> So agreeable in every point
is <hi>Daniel</hi> with the <hi>Apocalypse. <hi>And shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Confiscation of Goods, by Burnings, Croysades, and
Massacres, upon which this little Horn will put the
Ten Horns as his occasions require, as is also noted
<hi>Apoc.</hi> Ch. 13. v. 7. and in this Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi>

judge the little Horn or Papal Hierarchy, which is
the Two-horned Beast in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> or the Whore
of <hi>Babylon.</hi> To this alludes that saying of the Angel,
<hi>Apoc. 17. And there came one of the Seven Angels
which had the Seven Vials and talked with me, saying
unto me, I will shew unto thee the Iudgment of the
great Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>re that sitteth upon many waters, with whom
the Kings of the Earth have committed fornication.</hi>
And part of this judgment is menaced against her in
the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Thyatira, Apoc.</hi> 2. 20.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59418:81"/>
under the name of <hi>Iezebel,</hi> who calleth her self a
Prophetess, but seduces <hi>Christ</hi>'s Servants to commit
Fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto Idols.
Which Prophetess so called by her self is the Papal
Hierarchy who boast themselves <hi>infallible,</hi> but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is menaced against them, Ver. 22. <hi>Behold, I
will cast her into a Bed, and them that commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
with her into great tribulation if they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of their deeds.</hi> Which Judgment fell upon her
in the happy Reformation, when so many Kingdoms
and Countries deserted the Pope. And likewise in
the Song of the risen Witnesses, Ch. 15. v. 4. <hi>Who
shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name?
for thou only art Holy, for all Nations shall come and
worship before thee. For thy Iudgments are made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</hi>
And this is the former part of the execution
of the Sentence against the <hi>little Horn</hi> or <hi>great
Whore.</hi> But the Execution goes on in the Seven
Vials. <hi>And they shall take away his Dominion to
consume and destroy it unto the end;</hi> that is, By
that time all the Vials be poured out upon the Two-horned
Beast, the <hi>little Horn</hi> with <hi>Eyes,</hi> or the <hi>False
Prophet,</hi> his Dominion shall be quite destroyed and
consumed, which is the <hi>Second</hi> part of the Doom of
the <hi>little Horn,</hi> and will be compleated under the
seventh Vial, with which the Vision of that Divine
Heros <hi>on the white Horse</hi> with a <hi>Sword coming out
of his mouth</hi> doth contemporize. Which Sword out
of his mouth answers to the fiery stream out of the
mouth of the Ancient of Days, and both to that of
S. <hi>Paul, 2 Thess.</hi> 2. where he says, that <hi>the Lord shall
consume</hi> the Man of Sin, <hi>by the Spirit of his mouth,
and destroy him with the brightness of his coming,</hi> as I
have noted above. Now as the little Horn is doomed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59418:82"/>
to destruction (from whence the <hi>man of Sin</hi> is called
the <hi>Son of perdition, 2 Thess.</hi> 2.) by this Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory,
which is one part of their Act in this Session;
so that ample and everlasting Kingdom that succeeds
the destruction of the little Horn, is adjudged to the
truly Apostolick, Catholick Church, of whom Christ
alone is Head. Which is the other part of the Act
of this Session, and which alone is taken notice of
<hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. 4. the other part having been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of Ch. 17. and 18.</p>
            <p>27. <hi>And the Kingdom and Dominion, and the
greatness of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven
shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most
High.</hi> This is that other part of the Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by that Divine Sanhedrim in the behalf of
the true Church that had been afflicted and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so long under the Tyranny of the <hi>little Horn.</hi>
The true Church then consisting of <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi>
will overspread all. This is to be accomplished under
the second and third Thunders. And I think no body
can doubt but that the people of the Saints of the most
High are the truly Catholick and Apostolick Church,
if he consider the description of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> in
the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> And the <hi>most High</hi> is <hi>Christ,</hi> who
there is termed <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</hi> and
the <hi>Messias</hi> will be acknowledged in those days to be
such both by <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi> This answers to that
of <hi>Apoc. 20. 4. And I saw Thrones and they sate upon
them, and Iudgment was given unto them,</hi> and the
result was, <hi>They that had not worshipped the Beast,
neither his Image,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they lived and reigned with
Christ a thousand years,</hi> acknowledging him the only
universal Head of the Church. This will be the <hi>truly
Holy Catholick Church of Christ</hi> as they are here called
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59418:82"/>
the <hi>people of the Saints of the most High. <hi>Whose
Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom,</hi>
               </hi> not to end
upon Earth till the last Thunder or Conflagration ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the tenour of the <hi>Apocalypse. <hi>And all
Dominions shall serve and obey him.</hi>
               </hi> All Nations
and Kingdoms shall willingly submit themselves to,
and injoy themselves in this mightily extended and
overspreading Kingdom of the Son of man which the
Ancient of Days had assigned to him. Which well
may be called the Kingdom of the Son of <hi>man</hi> in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdistinction
to those other Four Kingdoms that are
set out by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

true Church of <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Son of man</hi> (as the
Four Beasts or rather Wights in the <hi>Apocalypse)</hi> are
all full of Eyes within and without. And certainly the
Kingdom of the Son of man will be a Kingdom of
<hi>unaffected Prudence, defecate Reason</hi> and <hi>holy Love.</hi>
For this is the true Man, the rest in us is but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

shall consist the Kingdom of <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Son of man,</hi>
(as he perpetually calls himself) after the abolition

            <p>28. <hi>Hitherto is the end of the matter,</hi> namely,
the matter the Angel communicated to him by way
of Interpretation of the Vision. <hi>As for me Daniel,
my cogitations much troubled me, and my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

or Angelical Actuation or Impression. <hi>But I kept
the matter in my heart,</hi> that is, I committed it firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and carefully to my memory, so that I might

a little before, at which he had conceived a displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

alone accosting <hi>Iaddus</hi> in his Pontifical ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit

adored, should condescend thus humbly to adore this

professed to <hi>Parmenio,</hi> confident of success. And
<hi>Iaddus,</hi> which yet further might confirm his hopes,
shewed him the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> I suppose that place
in the Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> where it is
said, <hi>And a mighty King shall stand up that shall rule
with great Dominion and do according to his will,</hi> &amp;c.
Which the High Priest might well interpret of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
his present expedition, and he, in virtue of his
Vision in <hi>Dios,</hi> of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> appearing there
to him in the Pontifical habit (as he did also to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
and S. <hi>Iohn)</hi> firmly believe him. As we also
from these considerations may easily believe that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>'s
Conquests were rather a meer gift of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, than the fruit of his own Prowess
or Policy.</p>

            <argument>
               <p> The Vision of the Ram and He-goat, betokening the
Kings of Media and Persia, and the Kings of Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
Chap. 8.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Vision of the <hi>Image</hi> consisting of <hi>Four
Metals</hi> and that of the <hi>Four Beasts,</hi> both of
them reached from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire inclusively,
to the glorious Reign of Christ upon Earth in his true
Apostolick Church in the blessed <hi>Millennium.</hi> Now
follows a Vision that insists more largely on some
parts of the time of the foregoing Visions, namely,
those of the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> but chiefly of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Empire; which is like the Method in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi>
Where first in a more general and comprehensive way
the state of the Christian Church from the beginning
thereof to the last Vial is set out in [Chap. 11.] and
then again the same period of time is run over in the
Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Chapters. But
afterwards the Visions concern but parts of the same
period which are more fully insisted on. And so we
shall find it here in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the rest of the Visions
concern but parts of the times that are represented
by the Image of the <hi>Four Metals,</hi> and the Vision of
the <hi>Four Beasts.</hi> And this of the <hi>Ram</hi> and <hi>He-goat</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:59418:84"/>
here in this Eighth Chapter concerns the times of the
<hi>Medo-Persian</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire only, in manner as
follows.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In the third year of the Reign of King Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar</hi>
King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and immediate Predecessor
of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede, <hi>A Uision appeared to me, even
to me Daniel;</hi> Non jam secundum quietem,</hi> says <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
sed</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not in <hi>sleep</hi> but when I was
<hi>awake,</hi> and up and abroad. Else if it had been in his
sleep on his Bed he would have expressed so much in
like manner as before. <hi>After that which appeared
to me at First,</hi> namely, in the beginning of the Reign
of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> Chap. 7.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>And I saw in a Uision, (and it came to pass
that I was at Shushan in the Palace which is in
the Province of Elam.)</hi> He describes the place
where he saw this Vision as well as the time when.
Now this <hi>Shushan</hi> is that Royal City of the <hi>Persians,</hi>
that is called <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>sa</hi> in Historians and Geographers, a
famous City situated betwixt <hi>Persis</hi> and <hi>Babylonia,</hi>
from whence the Country round about is called
<hi>Susiana.</hi> But there is mention of this <hi>Susa</hi> being in
the Province of <hi>Elam,</hi> that is, of <hi>Elymais,</hi> because
<hi>Elam</hi> is the Name of the <hi>Persian</hi> people. <hi>Isa.</hi> 21. 2.
Go up O <hi>Elam,</hi> besiege O <hi>Media; Ascende O</hi> Elam,
i.e. <hi>Persa, &amp; tu O</hi> Mede <hi>invadite urbem,</hi> &amp;c. says
<hi>Cornelius à Lapide.</hi> The Vision therefore which so
much concerns the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, <hi>Daniel</hi> saw upon
the spot even in the Province of <hi>Elam,</hi> which denotes
the <hi>Persians. <hi>And I saw in a Uision and I was by
the River Ulas.</hi>
               </hi> Which is <hi>Vlaeus Fluvius</hi> with Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
and Geographers. That of <hi>Pliny</hi> is for our
purpose, <hi>Susianen ab</hi> Elymaide <hi>disterminat Amnis</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus
<hi>ortus in</hi> Medis <hi>medióque spatio cuniculis conditus,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59418:85"/>
ac rursus exortus per</hi> Mesobatenen <hi>lapsus circuit arcem</hi>
Susorum. It rises in <hi>Media,</hi> touches upon <hi>Susa,</hi> and
at last exonerates it self into the <hi>Sinus Persicus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Ptolemy</hi> as well as <hi>Bochartus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Then I lift up mine eyes and saw, and behold
there stood before the River,</hi> that is, he saw exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
with his Eyes when he had some charge there
under <hi>Belshazzar</hi> before that high honour of all which
he bestowed upon him. <hi>A Ram which had two
Horns,</hi> by which as the Angel anon Interprets, is
understood the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Empire, and Kings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
<hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> being noted by the Two Horns,
as by the Two Horns of the Beast, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. the Two
Patriarchates of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> are noted.
But why the <hi>Persian</hi> King with his Kingdom should
be represented by a Ram, many reasons occur. For
first a Ram is a strong pugnacious Animal, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Chaldee as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Hebrew signifies to
be <hi>strong,</hi> as it also signifies, the last I mean, a <hi>Ram.</hi>
And such Paronomastical allusions are not unusual
with the Prophets, as I have observed elsewhere. The
strength therefore and pugnaciousness of the Ram,
well represent <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his Successours. But second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a Ram, according to <hi>Achmetes</hi> signifies riches,
which therefore intimates the vast treasures laid up
in the Castle at <hi>Susa</hi> and other places, in <hi>Cyrus</hi> and
<hi>Darius Codomannus</hi> his time also; see <hi>Grotius</hi> upon
the place, of whom you may have a more particular
account. And lastly you may cast in that also, That
for the kindness of the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> to the <hi>Iews,</hi>
(especially in comparison of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchs
and <hi>Greek)</hi> they making several favourable decrees
in their behalf, they with their Kingdom is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the figure of this better sort of Animals, as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59418:85"/>
Sheep are conceived to be, whether Male or Female,
and a Ram is of the Male-kind thereof. Wherefore
though they were as a Bear to other Nations, yet
they were as a Ram to the <hi>Iews,</hi> or rather as a Sheep.
<hi>And the Two Horns were high, but one was higher
than the other.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi> here are preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Medes. <hi>And the higher came up last.</hi>
               </hi> The
<hi>Persian</hi> power, namely, did emerge into that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
after the <hi>Median.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>I saw the Ram pushing West-ward, and
North-ward, and South-ward.</hi> He pusht West-ward,
when <hi>Darius Hystaspis</hi> and <hi>Xerxes</hi> made war against
<hi>Greece; Babylonia</hi> also is West-ward of <hi>Persia,</hi> which
<hi>Cyrus</hi> took. He pusht North-ward, when the said
<hi>Darius</hi> made war against the <hi>Scythians.</hi> And South-ward,
when <hi>Cambyses,</hi> and others of their Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
<hi>Aegypt, Aethiopia</hi> and <hi>Libya. <hi>So that no
Beast did stand before him, neither was there any
that could deliver out of his hand, but he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will and became great.</hi>
               </hi> For the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
took <hi>Babylon</hi> with its whole Empire, <hi>Lydia</hi> also
and <hi>Ionia, Asia minor</hi> and <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>And as I was considering behold an He-goat.</hi>
That the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire is denoted by the He-goat we
have the authority of the Angel for it, Ver. 21. And
why he should signifie the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, there be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
reasons for it: As first, it is a very apt allusion
to the Ancient Name of the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> For a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Greeks</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Caranus</hi> taking
the City of <hi>Aedessa, Caranus</hi> called it afterwards <hi>Aegea,</hi>
from the Flock of Goats (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Greek) that led
him in a misty mizling day unto the City, his <hi>omen</hi>
lying in them, according to the prediction of an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
which bid him fix his Seat in <hi>Macedonia</hi> where
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59418:86"/>
the Goats should lead him. And therefore <hi>urbem
Aedessam ob memoriam muneris Aegeas, populum Aegea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
vocavit,</hi> saith <hi>Iustin, Lib.</hi> 7. So that the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi>
(and <hi>Alexander</hi> was such) their being called
<hi>Aegeatae,</hi> which is as much as the Goat-people in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
may be one palpable reason why the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
Empire should be represented by a Goat. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>Hircus rapaces significat,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> observes
out of <hi>Achmetes.</hi> Thirdly, In that he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Hircus caprarum,</hi> it denotes <hi>Alexander</hi>'s young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
when he began his enterprise of overrunning the
Eastern Empire, he being not much past Twenty
years old. Fourthly, The clambring nature of the
Goat that gets upon the highest and steepest Rocks,
sets out the bold aspiring mind of <hi>Alexander,</hi> to say
nothing of that * strange exploit of his, literally taken,
in <hi>India,</hi> his ascending with his Soldiers an high crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
Rock that <hi>Hercules</hi> himself was deterr'd from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprising.
And lastly comparing the <hi>Greek</hi> Nation
with the <hi>Persian,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> notes of Goats and Sheep,
that the Goats are the wiser and more ready-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Animal; so the <hi>Greeks</hi> were more cunning and
more clear-headed than the <hi>Persians.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Interpreters comment on the Text. And how
much Philosophy flourished in <hi>Greece</hi> is well known,
and that <hi>Aristotle</hi> was the Master of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and
how that they affected not only long Robes but long
Beards, which some wits among them have compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to that of a Goat, as you may see in the <hi>Greek
Anthology, Lib. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Came from the
We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> Greece</hi> being seated West of <hi>Persia. <hi>On the
face of the whole Earth.</hi>
               </hi> Whereby is intimated the
largeness of his divagations in this his Expedition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the East, and the over-spreading of his Victories.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59418:86"/>
               <hi>And touched not the ground,</hi> Which is an indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his swiftness and speed. The swiftness of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
in <hi>Virgil</hi> is expressed thus, <hi>Aeneid. Lib.</hi> 7.
<q>
                  <l>Illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret</l>
                  <l>Gramina, nec teneras cursu laesisset aristas.</l>
               </q>
And <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifies an He-goat and is the word
here used, is from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifies to <hi>fly.</hi> So that
this also may have some allusion to this extraordinary
speed in <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Victories, who in the space of
Six years over-ran and vanquished the <hi>Persians,</hi> the
<hi>Medes,</hi> the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations. <hi>And the Goat had a notable Horn
betwéen his eyes.</hi> Where it is worth our taking
notice of, that here is the Goat and his Horn, which
cannot be the same thing in nature, but one the part
of the other, and there is but one Goat, and therefore
no more than one Empire can be understood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
which is the <hi>Greek,</hi> of which <hi>Alexander</hi> was the
first Horn or Sovereign. But it is placed betwixt
the Eyes of the Goat, meerly for the embellishing
the Cortex of the Vision, supposing an Animal have
but one Horn, that being the most seemly placing
of it.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>And he came to the Ram that had Two Horns
which I had seen standing before the River,</hi> that is,
The <hi>Greek</hi> forces assaulted the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> signified
by the Ram. <hi>And ran unto him in the fury of his
power. <hi>Pliny</hi>
               </hi> observes that Goats are of a more hot
and fiery temper than Sheep. So well do the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols
agree with the things signified.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>And I saw him come close to the Ram, and
he was moved with choler against him,</hi> with a fiery
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59418:87"/>
courage and animosity. <hi>And smote the Ram and
brake his Two Horns.</hi> The Two Kingdoms of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
and <hi>Persia. <hi>And there was no power in the Ram
to stand before him,</hi>
               </hi> neither in <hi>campis Adrastiis</hi> or at
<hi>Granicus</hi> a River of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> the first Battle that was
fought betwixt <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> his <hi>Satrapae,</hi>
nor at <hi>Issus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia</hi> where the second was fought,
and where the exceeding numerous Army of <hi>Darius</hi>
was put to flight, from whence the City by <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
was after called <hi>Nicopolis. <hi>But he cast him down
to the ground and stamped upon him.</hi>
               </hi> For all <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
brought out a far more numerous Army against
him this last time than before, yet <hi>Alexander</hi> quite
vanquished him and the whole strength of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
at <hi>Arbela</hi> a City of <hi>Assyria. <hi>And there was
none that could deliver the Ram out of his hands.</hi>
               </hi>
Nay the terrour of <hi>Alexander</hi> was such, that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Darius</hi> his own nearest friends to betray him.
And so <hi>Alexander</hi> was made Master of the whole
<hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Therefore the He-goat waxed very great;</hi>
that is, The Kingdom of the <hi>Greeks</hi> was exceedingly
inlarged by this accession of the <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
added thereunto by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
so called for thus inlarging his Empire. <hi>And
when he was strong,</hi> as having all this power of the
<hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> added to his own. <hi>The great
Horn was broken.</hi> This <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, for
all his greatness died, and that an immature and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
death, in the very Flower of his Age, at about
the Thirty second or Thirty third year thereof, and
that by Poyson as Historians record. <hi>And,</hi> after this
great Horn of the Goat was broken, <hi>for it came up
four notable ones.</hi> Not in comparison of the first
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59418:87"/>
great one that was broken, but in comparison of the
rest of <hi>Alexander's</hi> Captains amongst whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
was divided after his death. But in that there is
not the least mention or intimation of any more than
<hi>one Goat,</hi> it is gross delirancy for any one to imagine
the Horns here mentioned to belong to any other but
to him. Whence it is as clear as Noon-day that all
the Horns here mentioned signifying particular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignties,
there being in the mean time but one
Beast mentioned, which necessarily implies but one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
State, or Kingdom, that all these particular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignties
must be the Sovereignties of one and the
same State or Empire which the <hi>Goat</hi> signified, which
is the <hi>Greek Empire.</hi> The Four notable Horns where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
here aimed at, I conceive, are * <hi>Ptolemaeus</hi> the
Son of <hi>Lagus,</hi> Sovereign of <hi>Aegypt; Lysimachus</hi> of
<hi>Thracia, Antigonus</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Cassander</hi> (the Son
of <hi>Antipater)</hi> Sovereign of <hi>Macedonia. <hi>Toward
the Four Winds of Heaven,</hi>
               </hi> that is, East, West,
North, and South; <hi>Aegypt</hi> lying in the South, <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>
in the North, <hi>Macedonia</hi> in the West, and <hi>Asia</hi>
in the East, if we compare the situation of these Four
Principalities one with another.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>And out of one of them came forth a little
Horn which waxed excéeding great.</hi> This cannot
be understood restrainedly of the particular Person
of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> * but of the Kingdom of the
<hi>Seleucidae</hi> commencing from <hi>Seleucus Satrapa</hi> or
Prefect of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who was none of the Four nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Horns, but himself being less notable grew up by
the favour of one especially of the most notable ones,
namely, King <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> to whom he made his address
when <hi>Antigonus</hi> would have turned him out of his
Prefecture, as you may see in <hi>Diodorus Siculus.</hi> But
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59418:88"/>
this little Horn, the Kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> which
rose from such small beginnings later than the rest,
grew afterwards very great. First, <hi>Antigonus</hi> King
of <hi>Asia</hi> being vanquished and slain, <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy</hi>
divided the greatest part of the spoils betwixt
them. And <hi>Seleucus</hi> afterwards, <hi>Demetrius Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorcetes</hi>
the Son of <hi>Antigonus</hi> being taken by him,
he got to himself the Empire of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Asia.</hi> So
exceeding great did this little Horn grow in <hi>Seleucus</hi>
his time, but nothing comparable to this in <hi>Antiochus
Epiphanes</hi> his. <hi>Toward the South, and toward
the East.</hi> This little Horn so called from its small
beginnings (as the little Horn, Chap. 7. is) is to be
understood of the whole continuation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> or the succession of the Kings
of <hi>Syria</hi> or <hi>Assyria,</hi> as <hi>Helvicus</hi> styles them, and so
the Vision is to be applied to such parts of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
as it fits with. And therefore this part may
point more particularly to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who
toward the East overcame <hi>Artaxias</hi> King of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and had over-run <hi>Aegypt</hi> also in the South, but
that at his Siege of <hi>Alexandria</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Legat <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius</hi>
interceded in the name of the Senate, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed
him so, that he durst proceed no further
but retroceded from his enterprise on <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as you
may see in <hi>Iustin. <hi>And toward the pleasant Land.</hi>
               </hi>
The Hebrew word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifies what is
<hi>beautifull, fair,</hi> and <hi>pleasant.</hi> All Interpreters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it of the Land of <hi>Iudea,</hi> this being the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of that Land in Holy Scripture, as <hi>Psal. 38.
The City of Ierusalem is</hi> said to be <hi>beautifull for situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the joy of the whole Earth;</hi> and <hi>Ezec.</hi> 20. 6.
the Land of <hi>Iudea</hi> is described as a Land flowing
with Milk and Honey, and <hi>as the glory of all Lands.</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59418:88"/>
Not but that <hi>Iudea</hi> belonged to the Kingdom of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
or of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> before, but that there is here
a peculiar occasion of mentioning it, because <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
Epiphanes</hi> being disappointed of his purpose on
<hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> made presently after, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Iudea</hi> to vent his choler upon them. Nor do
I deny, though the little Horn in its more general
sense takes in the whole succession of the Kings of
<hi>Syria,</hi> but that yet it may more peculiarly aim at
<hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> * Which is the Genius of the
Prophetick Style to give as it were Two strokes at
once, and under one figure to represent both the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
state of the thing, and also some more <hi>special</hi>
part thereof alone. And here that may luckily come
in of <hi>Grotius,</hi> who understands the Horn out of which
the little Horn comes, to be <hi>Antiochus Magnus,</hi> the
Father of <hi>Epiphanes,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanes</hi> to be called little
because he was <hi>modicae primùm fortunae, privatus, &amp;
Romae obses,</hi> of a mean fortune at first in a private
condition, and an hostage at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. <hi>And it waxed great even to the Host of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
that is, So far that it fought against the People
of God, the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, whose God is called the
<hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> of which his own people are peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a part, and may be said to have kept garrison, as
it were, in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Temple being as it were
the main fortress thereof. And <hi>Grotius</hi> understands
it peculiarly of the Levites there watching. <hi>And it
cast down some of the Host,</hi> that is, <hi>Antiochus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
some of the Priests and Levites, and of the
<hi>Iews</hi> in general, to forsake the Law and to observe
the Customs of the Heathens, as you may see in
the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Maccabees</hi> at large. <hi>And of the Stars
to the ground.</hi> Even some of those that were or
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59418:89"/>
should have been great Lights to the people by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their Learnedness in the Law, were perverted
and precipitated into a compliance with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
Rites and Customes. <hi>And stamped upon
them,</hi> trode them into the very dirt and mire at last
of abominable prophanations.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Yea he magnified himself even to the Prince
of the Host,</hi> that is, So as to set himself above him,
to dispose of the High Priesthood as he pleased, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
as he was more largely bribed; as the case
was in <hi>Iason</hi> and <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and to put an end to the
service of the Temple, and the daily sacrifice as it
follows. <hi>And by him the daily sacrifice was taken
away.</hi> These things <hi>Grotius</hi> would refer to the High
Priest, but the more full and genuine sense is, that
<hi>Epiphanes</hi> magnified himself above God himself by
thus taking away that service that God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for himself. And moreover he rose to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
that he would bring in the Idol of <hi>Iupiter
Olympius</hi> into the Temple to take possession thereof,
as if he intended to turn the true Owner out of doors,
who abominates Idols, and has strictly forbid his
people the worshipping of them; see <hi>Cornelius à La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide</hi>
on the place. <hi>And the place of his Sanctuary
was cast down,</hi> that is, was debased and cast down
from that hight of sanctity that belonged to it before,
by vile Heathenish prophanations and sacrificing
Swines Flesh on the very Altar, as you may see in
<hi>Iosephus, Iudaic. Antiquit. lib. 12. c.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>And an Host was given him against the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sacrifice by reason of transgression.</hi> There is no
[him] in the Original, but the sense may run thus,
An Host shall be given, that is, granted or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Antiochus</hi> (of whom in the same place, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59418:89"/>
writes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to hinder the daily sacrifice, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i.e. <hi>through his
villany and wickedness,</hi> his haughtiness swelling to
so high a pitch of impiety. To this sense <hi>Grotius</hi>
glosses on the place, and it is consentaneous to what
follows in <hi>Iosephus</hi> in the same Chapter. For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after, it is said, they built a Fort or Castle
that could command the Temple, to nose, as it
were, the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and deter both Priest
and People from their duties touching the daily sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
For in that Castle did <hi>Antiochus</hi> place <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a <hi>Macedonick</hi> guard, for the purpose.
<hi>And it cast down the truth to the ground,</hi> that is,
The true Religion or true worship of God contained
then in the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And as if this Chapter of
<hi>Iosephus</hi> were a comment on this passage of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
it follows in order after this, that, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the Holy Book that containeth the Law of
<hi>Moses</hi> wherever it was found, it was presently abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
<hi>i.e.</hi> torn in pieces or burnt. <hi>And it practised and
prospered,</hi> that is, These wicked doings of <hi>Antiochus</hi>
succeeded and obtained for a time. That the ancient
Fathers make <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> a Type of Antichrist
(whose time is also set) is better known than that
I need to note it. But in nothing is Antichrist like
his Type more than in trampling under foot the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scripture, (as <hi>Antiochus</hi> caused to be burnt or
torn in pieces the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Law
of God contained in the Holy Bible,) that the People
of God, without any scruple, might be made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the vain inventions of men; in his cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
of them that will not partake of his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
sacrifice of the Mass, as the <hi>Iews</hi> were perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59418:90"/>
tortured, and killed for not communicating
in their Feast of sacrificed Swines Flesh, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
touching <hi>Eleazar, 2 Maccab.</hi> 6. 18. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in endeavouring to Heathenize the People of
God again by many Idolatrous and Pagan-like Rites
and Customs, as you may see <hi>Antiochus</hi> did in the
Books of <hi>Maccabees.</hi> But this only by the by, we
go on.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>Then I heard one Saint speaking, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Saint said unto that certain Saint that spake.
Saint</hi> here is as much as <hi>Angel,</hi> as Ch. 4. 13. <hi>And
behold a Watcher and an Holy one,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as here
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That Angels are called <hi>Holy ones</hi> and <hi>Watchers</hi>
is from the ethereal purity, exertedness, and activity
of their nature, as well as from their office and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
they being as it were the vicarious eyes of
God to watch over his people for their good, and
to see that righteous things be done among men.
The most easie and genuine translation of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
I think is this, <hi>Then I heard an Angel speaking,
and that same speaking Angel said,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to a certain one who shall be nameless, as
if it were put for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the sense I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
But it being a word occurring no where
but here, and <hi>Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion,</hi> and the
<hi>Septuagint</hi> not venturing to interpret it, but leaving
it as they found it in the Original <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Phelmoni,</hi>
it raises a suspicion in me that there is some greater
mystery in it than some men are aware of, and
therefore, I conceive, with <hi>Calvin,</hi> it is a title of
Christ, and that this Angel here called <hi>Palmoni,</hi> is
Christ himself, having this mystical name from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Pele,</hi> wonderfull, which is one of the Titles of him,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 13. and from <hi>Almoni,</hi> which is from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutuit,</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59418:90"/>
and in <hi>Pihel, colligavit,</hi> which intimate the
ineffableness and unutterableness of the admirable
union or colligation of the Humane nature with the
Divine, of the Soul of the <hi>Messias</hi> with the eternal
<hi>Logos,</hi> as it is said also of him in the <hi>Apocalypse, That
he has a Name written that no man knows but himself.</hi>
Which admirable and unspeakable condition of Christ
is set out by this word <hi>Palmoni.</hi> * Which is the
sense that <hi>Calvin</hi> himself seems to aim at upon the
place. <hi>How long shall be the Uision concerning the
daily sacrifice, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> Concerning the taking of it away,
how long will that condition last? <hi>And that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of desolation, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> That wicked usage of
<hi>Antiochus</hi> against the People of God and their City
and Sanctuary, which he will so greatly oppress and
make desolate, as it follows in the next words. <hi>To
give both the Sanctuary and the Host to be troden
under foot,</hi> to be insulted over, despised and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
By the Host here in the first place may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the Priests and Levites that kept watch and
ward there in the Temple, engarrison'd, as it were,
in this great and glorious Castle of the God of <hi>Israel.</hi>
To say nothing of the Angelical Powers residing there,
such as were heard to say before the final destruction
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Temple, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Let us go hence,</hi> but no small part also of this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
this Host are the rest of the People of <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. <hi>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand
thrée hundred days, then shall the Sanctuary be
cleansed.</hi> The Hebrew has it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Evening-mornings,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Which plainly shews that
<hi>Prophetical</hi> days are not here meant but <hi>natural</hi> days.
And it being an unskilfull conceit to think there was
an affectation to predict the time to a very day that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59418:91"/>
this desolation or oppression from <hi>Antiochus</hi> should
continue upon God's People, it is plain the time is
to be reduced into years. And so by the answer
may be signified there would be Six years or there-about,
which may comprehend the first coming of
<hi>Antiochus</hi> into <hi>Iudea</hi> when the Priesthood was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned,
as also his second, his Interdicting the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daick</hi>
Rites, the placing the Idol in the Temple, and
the whole time of the Intermission of the daily sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
so <hi>Grotius</hi> expresly upon the place. But from the
time of that gross prophanation of the Temple when
<hi>Antiochus</hi> his Soldiers set an Heathenish Altar in the
Sanctuary and sacrificed Swine's Flesh on it, till <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
Eupator</hi> granted the <hi>Iews</hi> the free use of their
Religion and Temple, <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi> reckons about
Three years and a half. Which may give a glance,
being Prophetically understood, at the <hi>Time</hi> of the
true Antichrist, Chap. 7. as to the duration of the
entireness of his Kingdom. <hi>Then shall the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
be cleansed.</hi> At least by that time it shall be
cleansed.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>And it came to pass when I, even I Daniel,
had seen the Uision and sought for the meaning;</hi>
he praying in his heart that he might understand it,
<hi>Then behold there stood before me as the appearance
of a Man.</hi> An Angel externally visible to him in
humane Shape. For this is not a Dream, or Night-Vision,
but a Day-Vision, as I observed out of <hi>Grotius</hi>
in the beginning.</p>
            <p>16. <hi>And I heard a Man's voice betwéen the banks
of Ulai.</hi> The River <hi>Vlaeus</hi> that runs by <hi>Susa,</hi> betwixt
the Banks of this River he heard the voice of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni,</hi>
or Christ: Who since he could walk on the
Waters when he was in the Flesh, might well appear
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59418:91"/>
betwixt the Banks of <hi>Vlai</hi> in the Air, or upon the
Water, and there speak in a Man's voice before he
was incarnate. <hi>Which called and said, Gabriel,
make this man understand the Uision.</hi> The giving
this command to <hi>Gabriel</hi> shews, that this <hi>Palmoni</hi> is
no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, any ordinary Angel; but this
and what was above-said may well assure us that
it was the Prince of Angels, yea Christ himself, if
we add what will occur in the Tenth Chapter.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>So he came near where I stood, and when
he came I was afraid.</hi> And might have been more
astonish'd if <hi>Palmoni</hi> himself had come so near him,
when he could not bear the presence of one of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.
<hi>And fell on my face,</hi> Through very asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
my Spirits failed in me. <hi>But he said unto
me, Understand O Son of man,</hi> that is, be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and diligent to conceive what I say. <hi>For at the
time of the end shall be the Uision.</hi> Though it be
long, even about 400 years, till this of the little
Horn be fulfilled in <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> yet at the
end for a certain the Vision will be accomplished. To
say nothing how its Antitype at another <hi>Time of the
End,</hi> even during the <hi>Time and Times and half a
Time,</hi> will have its completion too.</p>
            <p>18. <hi>Now as he was speaking with me,</hi> namely,
At the hearing of his voice, I was as much stounded
thereat as before at his sight, and so sinking down
fell upon my face, my Spirits retiring as in those
that are in a deep sopor, as if they were half dead.
And therefore our English Translation is not so exact
that renders the following words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>I was in a déep sléep on my face toward the ground.
Vatablus</hi> has it, <hi>Sopore correptus cecidi in faciem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
in terram,</hi> and <hi>Calvin, Sopitus corrui,</hi> &amp;c. And the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59418:92"/>
vulgar Latin, <hi>Collapsus sum pronus in terram.</hi> Which
therefore signifies a sounding fit that took him at the
hearing the voice of the Angel. Hence <hi>Daniel</hi> is
concluded to have fallen twice to the ground, the
first time at the <hi>sight,</hi> the second at the <hi>voice</hi> of the
Angel, says <hi>Maldonat.</hi> Which naturally implies,
that saving in these sounding fits <hi>Daniel</hi> was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
awake, and that this Vision was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so called, a <hi>Day-Vision</hi> not a <hi>Night-Vision</hi> or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Dream. <hi>But he touched me and set me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi>
The Hebrew is, He made me stand upon
my standing, that is, By his touch he enabled me to
stand upon my Feet again; so great vertue was there
in it. And no wonder that the Aethereal and vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Body or vehicle of an Angel which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
for the marvellous energy thereof, actuated
also by so holy an Inhabitant, should raise <hi>Daniel,</hi>
faln into a sound, unto life again, when holy Souls
even in their terrestrial Tenements have done such
marvellous cures, and by the application of their own
bodies have raised them to life that have been taken
to be dead, as <hi>Elisha</hi> did in the Widow's Child, and
<hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Eutychus.</hi> And here we see the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi>
(Christ appearing in humane shape by way of prelude
to his Incarnation) to have a preludious mission, as
of an Apostle, to preach to <hi>Daniel</hi> and to instruct
him, and to do Miracles also as the Apostles did.
For this is a priviledge of the Ministers of Christ's
Kingdom, the <hi>Malcuth</hi> of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> which
is the Tenth <hi>Sephirah</hi> with the <hi>Cabbalists,</hi> as <hi>Gebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
the Fifth, the Topick of the Powers belonging to
that Kingdom, of which doing Miracles is one. And
<hi>Gabriel</hi> here, the Angel, his name signifies the Power
of God, or the Strength of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59418:92"/>19. <hi>And he said, Behold I will make thée know
what shall be in the last end of the Indignation.</hi>
For this prediction of the wrath of God in the time
of <hi>Antiochus</hi> against his People, and the raging ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of <hi>Antiochus</hi> over them, is the main drift of
this Vision, and here the Angel promises to tell what
shall come at the end thereof, which he does Ver. 25.
That he shall be broken without hand. <hi>For at the
time appointed the end shall be.</hi> All times and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
are in the hands of God, and he can determine
as he pleases, and at his appointed time the Heat
of those Persecutions and Oppressions of the <hi>Iews</hi>
under <hi>Antiochus</hi> shall have an end, they being not
to last passing 2300 days as was declared above by
<hi>Palmoni,</hi> that Prince of Angels and Men, and of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
especially.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>The Ram which thou sawest having Two
Horns are the Kings of Media and Persia,</hi> that is,
The whole race of those Kings from <hi>Cyrus</hi> to <hi>Darius
Codomannus,</hi> as is to be understood from Ver. 4.
where the Ram is said to push West-ward and North-ward,
and South-ward, which was not performed by
any one King but by the succession. For that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical
Ram, says <hi>Gasper Sanctius,</hi> rusht out of <hi>Persis</hi>
an Oriental Quarter, and turning himself to the
South assaulted <hi>Aegypt, Aethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Libya;</hi> to
the North, <hi>Pontus, Scythia,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> and
turning himself to the West he made himself Master
of the <hi>Babylonians, Assyrians,</hi> (I suppose he means
<hi>Syrians)</hi> and the Isles of the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> These
things were not performed by one King but by the
succession. And <hi>Grotius</hi> particularizes for the main.
For upon [towards the West] the <hi>Persians,</hi> says he,
under <hi>Darius</hi> the Son of <hi>Hystaspis</hi> and <hi>Xerxes</hi> made
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59418:93"/>
war upon <hi>Greece,</hi> [towards the North] the said <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
made war against the <hi>Scythians,</hi> [toward the
South] <hi>Cambyses</hi> invaded <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> as
I noted above. So evident is it that the whole suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
is understood of the Kings of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi>
by the Ram together with their Kingdom. Whence
it is reasonable that by the Goat the whole succession
of the Kings of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in like manner.</p>
            <p>21. <hi>And the rough Goat is the King of Grecia.
<hi>Hic Rex pro regno ponitur Hebraicâ locutione quae ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
permiscet,</hi>
               </hi> says <hi>Grotius.</hi> And, I say, the rough
Goat is the Kings of <hi>Graecia</hi> together with their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or Empire, that is, The whole succession of their
Kings with their Kingdom or Empire. But now for
the rough Goat, as he is here called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that hirsute or long-haired Goat, and consequently
long-bearded, (which above was called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which Interpreters make to be a young Goat, and
refer it to the youngness of <hi>Alexander</hi> when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
this expedition against <hi>Darius</hi> to win the
Eastern Monarchy,) I do not see but this long-bearded
Goat as he is here described may have reference to
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s Army, it consisting of old Soldiers, as
<hi>Iustin</hi> describes them, the Leaders especially. <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
quoque nemo nisi sexagenarius duxit, ut si principia
castrorum cerneres, Senatum te alicujus priscae reipub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae
videre diceres.</hi> None, says <hi>Iustin,</hi> led the Files
unless he was Threescore years old, so that if you
viewed the Fore-part of the Army, you would take
them to be the Senate of some ancient Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
These long-bearded <hi>Sexagenarii</hi> appeared
in the Fore part of the Army as the Goat's Beard goes
before the rest of his Body. But at least the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59418:93"/>
of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Army consisting so much of
old Soldiers may very well be prefigured by this
long-haired or long-bearded Goat. <hi>And the great
Horn that is betwéen his Eyes is the first King.</hi>
This first King is most manifestly <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great, a thing that no man ever denied, and he is
the first Horn of the Goat, or first King of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Empire. From whence it necessarily follows that
there must be other Horns and other Kings to succeed
in this Body of the Goat or <hi>Greek</hi> Empire. This is
so plain that <hi>Grotius</hi> himself does allow it upon Ver. 8.
that the Four Horns of the Leopard as he calls them,
(he had better said Heads) belong to the <hi>Greek</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
that is, to the third Empire, and consequently
the Four Horns of the Goat. Thus much <hi>Grotius</hi>
whether he will or no, is forced to allow, though
upon Chap. 2. he seems to endeavour to avoid it.</p>
            <p>22. <hi>Now that being broken whereas Four stood
up for it, Four Kingdoms shall stand up out of the
Nation,</hi> namely, out of the <hi>Greek</hi> Nation. These
Four Kingdoms into which <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Empire was
divided <hi>Grotius</hi> is forced to confess, as to the first
Kings of them or Heads of them, that they belong
to the <hi>Leopard</hi> or <hi>Goat,</hi> the third Monarchy. Now
what a miserable and unnatural divulsion is there that
the Successours of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> suppose, of <hi>Ptolemaeus
Lagi,</hi> of <hi>Cassander</hi> and <hi>Lysimachus</hi> should be torn off
as it were from their Predecessors in their Four King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
respective, to make a distinct Empire from the
<hi>Greek,</hi> which is as mad and extravagant as to cut
off the Leopards and Goats Heads with their Horns
to make Two Goats and Two Leopards of them. And
yet this valiant exploit <hi>Grotius</hi> aims at, that he might
excuse the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire from being the Fourth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59418:94"/>
Beast, and the <hi>Papal</hi> Power the <hi>little Horn</hi> amongst
the other Ten. What <hi>Aegyptian</hi> darkness and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
will Prejudice and Interest cast men into, that
can entertain such impossible conceits as these? Here is
but <hi>one Goat</hi> and one great Horn and Four lesser Horns,
which lesser Horns imply so many successions of the
Four first Kings, be they longer or shorter. Which
therefore according to the Prophetick style and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense can make no more than one <hi>Greek</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
first entire under one King, and then divided
under Four, with their Successours. <hi>But not in his
power,</hi> that is, they were neither so valiant as he in
their own Persons, nor was their Kingdom so strong
by reason of the Wars among themselves, they squab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
one with another about the prey.</p>
            <p>23. <hi>And in the later time of their Kingdom when
transgressions are come to the full,</hi> that is, When
the Sins of the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be very much increased.
<hi>A King of fierce countenance understanding dark
Sentences shall stand up.</hi> This no man doubts but
is understood of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> but withall
most of the Ancient and Modern look upon <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
as a lively Type or Image of Antichrist. But in
that it is said [in the later time of their <hi>Kingdom]</hi>
in the singular number, that fairly offers to us this
truth, that in Prophetical account the <hi>four</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
named before are looked upon as <hi>one</hi> Kingdom
though they be divided into Four parts and have Four
Kings, some of longer and some of shorter succession.
But in that it is said [in the <hi>later time</hi> of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom]
<hi>viz.</hi> of the Four Kings as they were at first,
this does so manifestly tye the first Four Kings to their
succession even to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> his times, as
many of them as reached so far; that it is a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59418:94"/>
that the Kingdom of the Four Horns
doth extend it self into the times of <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi>
and that therefore the third Monarchy which
is the <hi>Greek</hi> reaches at least so far. Whereby <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
his fond conceit of making the Kingdom of the
<hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> the fourth Empire and the
fourth Beast, is quite blown away. And it is hence
evident that the fourth Beast or Empire is the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that <hi>Epiphanes</hi> is said to be a King of a fierce
countenance, the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may as well sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
<hi>vultu duro &amp; obfirmato,</hi> of an hard, bold, and
shameless countenance. The vulgar Latin renders
it, <hi>Rex impudens facie,</hi> and <hi>Gasper Sanctius</hi> records
one Specimen of his impudence out of S. <hi>Ierom,
Luxuriosus,</hi> says he, <hi>fuisse dicitur &amp; in tantum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decus,

be a sign of greater shamelesness than the spiritual
Fornication, I mean, the Idolatry of Antichrist, his
Antitype, not only practised by himself in publick
but also injoyned by him for others so to practise,
I leave the unprejudiced to consider, and whether
<hi>Antiochus</hi> his setting the Idol of <hi>Iupiter Olympius</hi> in
the Temple, be a greater piece of boldness than <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

setting himself in the Temple of God upon
the Holy Altar which is the throne of Christ or God,
to receive publick adoration from men there, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself as if he were God, or above him, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing

him, for who can null or abrogate the Law of God
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59418:95"/>
but that God that made it, or some God, if there
be any, higher than he? What <hi>Antiochus</hi> did to the
<hi>Iews</hi> in commanding them point-blank to transgress
the Laws of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and in making them
conform to the Idolatrous Laws of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (the
<hi>Samaritans,</hi> those false Brethren, writing in the mean
time to <hi>Antiochus</hi> in this style, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to the glorious God King <hi>Antiochus,)</hi> the
same does Antichrist in his forcing the true Servants
of the living God and faithfull Members of Christ, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the express Word of God, to worship Idols of
his own setting up, and so to pollute the Church
with <hi>Gentilism,</hi> his Flatterers in the mean time cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, <hi>Dominus Deus noster Papa,</hi> and that all is
right that he commands and no man must disobey
him, as I have noted above. These are great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of boldness in the <hi>Antitype</hi> as well as the <hi>Type,</hi>
who yet was never so bold as to avow that a piece of
Bread (such certainly, examined by the indubitable
Test of Sense, Scripture, and Reason) was either a
Man or God, and miserably to kill men if they would
not yield to this bold obtrusion.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>understanding dark Sentences</hi> as this
passage in some sense respects <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> so
it does Antichrist, and is, it may be, more eminently
fulfilled in the later than in the former. The Hebrew
word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, [Chidah] which most usually signifies
a Parable or Riddle, but it signifies also, at large,
any hard question. Such as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> is
said to propound to King <hi>Solomon,</hi> the word <hi>Chidah</hi>
is there used 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. where she is said to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
with him of all that was in her heart, and that
<hi>Solomon</hi> told her all her questions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which two
great persons surely spent not their time in, <hi>Riddle
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59418:95"/>
me, Riddle me, what's this?</hi> as Children sometimes
do, but the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> put hard and weighty
questions to him in points of State, Religion, and
Philosophy. And in the two former <hi>Antiochus</hi> might
be pretty well versed, and would not stick, when the
question was put, whether the pure worship of the
God of <hi>Israel</hi> such as himself had appointed was to
be kept, or the Rites of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to be brought in amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> to make all
his people of one Religion, and so the more to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
his Kingdom; he would not stick, I say, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
having an equal share of boldness as of wit,
that the <hi>pure worship</hi> of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> must stoop
to the <hi>Reason of State.</hi> And whether Antichrist has
not horribly defiled the Ancient pure Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
with gross Gentilism and Idolatry, to support
the wealth and greatness of his Antichristian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
let all indifferent men judge. These things
are so plain and open that they are unknown to none
but those that wilfully shut their eyes.</p>
            <p>But besides this, the Papal Hierarchy is a most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
understander of hard questions in matters of
Religion especially, and of State so far forth as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or Holy Church is therein concerned, as assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to themselves the privilege of <hi>Infallibility.</hi> So
that the Pope, with his Hierarchy at least, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
oracle of Christendom to solve hard questions.
Which makes me conceive that this passage [and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
dark Sentences and hard Questions] was
put in by the Spirit of Prophecy with a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
respect to <hi>Antichrist</hi> himself, than to <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
his Type. And indeed that Church would make
every Sentence in Scripture a Riddle or dark Sentence
that the Pope may have the pretence of interpreting
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59418:96"/>
it, who will be sure never to interpret it inconsistent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his own corrupt Interest.</p>
            <p>24. <hi>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his
own power.</hi> The Power of <hi>Antiochus</hi> over the <hi>Iews</hi>
was caused by some mistaken or ill-minded <hi>Iews</hi>
themselves. And as for Antichrist or the Head of the
<hi>healed Beast,</hi> or of the Beast that <hi>was and is not,
and yet is,</hi> it is plain <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. 13. that the Ten Kings
give their power to him. Thus plainly is his power
mighty but not by his own power. <hi>And he shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
wonderfully.</hi> But whether <hi>Antiochus</hi> destroyed
more <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Antichrist</hi> more Christians let any one
that reads History compute, and tell which of them
is the more <hi>wonderfull destroyer.</hi> For not only the
bloud of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> but the bloud of <hi>all</hi> the
slain upon Earth is laid to the charge of the Papal
Hierarchy, <hi>Apoc. 18. 24. And shall prosper and
practise. <hi>Antiochus</hi>

and the <hi>holy people</hi> are those that are instructed by
them which are called <hi>Saints, Apoc.</hi> 18. 24. What
a destroyer <hi>Antiochus</hi> was, and how much greater
a destroyer of these <hi>Antichrist</hi> has been, all History
rings of it. What <hi>Antiochus</hi> was to the sincere <hi>Iews,</hi>
the same was <hi>Antichrist</hi> and much more to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Apostolick <hi>Christians.</hi>

craft to prosper in his hand, and he shall magnifie
himself in his heart,</hi> that is, Applaud himself as all
Politicians do (when things succeed) for his own
great Policy that he has brought things to pass as they
are. This History testifies to be true as in <hi>Antiochus</hi>
so much more in <hi>Antichrist</hi> or the <hi>Papal Hierarchy,</hi>
there never having been a more cunning Polity in
the world as all Historians and Politicians are agreed.
Which perspicacity of theirs in Politicks is set out by
the little Horn with eyes (Chap. 7.) amongst the
Ten Horns as I have noted above on that Chapter.
<hi>And by peace shall he destroy many.</hi> The Hebrew

says <hi>à Lapide,</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> understands it of the <hi>Iews</hi>

what is this to the bloudy Massacres that <hi>Antichrist</hi>
has made upon the peaceable and innocent Protestants
and to the burning God knows how many beside
with Fire and Fagot? The examples are more fresh
than that they need to be named. <hi>He shall also

has it <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, where <hi>Grotius</hi> says, that
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is attributed to the Chiefs of all the Families
of the Priesthood, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 8. 24. and Ch. 10. v. 5. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the chief Priests being called <hi>Princes,</hi> the High
Priest must be the <hi>Prince of Princes</hi> here meant. And
let that be one sense, though <hi>Calvin</hi> says it is <hi>nimis
argutum &amp; infirmum.</hi> But this sense of the Prophecy
is fulfilled in <hi>Antiochus</hi> his setting up and pulling
down the High Priests at his own pleasure, against
the Law of God, as you may see in the Books of the
<hi>Maccabees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59418:97"/>
But is there nothing in Antichrist that answers this
presumption in <hi>Antiochus</hi> his standing up against the
Prince of Princes? Surely yes. What think you of
the Emperour? Has not Antichrist stood up against
him with a witness, and that many a time as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
record, and sometimes stood with his Foot
upon his neck singing <hi>Super aspidem &amp; Leonem am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulabis,</hi>
as I noted above? And other sometime has
humbled him so as to make him be content to receive
the Imperial Crown in the submissest manner ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
the Pope crowning him with his Feet, and
when the Crown was on, kicking it off again, as
<hi>Spo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>danus</hi> records of Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> the third. But
the full sense of the Prophecy in this passage I think
is not yet exhausted, but by the Prince of Princes is
also understood the God of <hi>Israel</hi> in reference to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
whose Temple he prophaned and robbed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
himself the Title of God, and was so saluted
by the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and at last brought in the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Desolation the Statue of <hi>Iupiter Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi>
in more full contempt of the God of <hi>Israel.</hi>
This is <hi>Antiochus</hi> his standing up against the <hi>Prince
of Princes,</hi> as <hi>Gasper Sanctius</hi> comments upon the
place, and I think not without judgment.</p>
            <p>But you will say, how is this fulfilled in Antichrist
or the Pope? How has he prophaned God's Temple,
or robbed it, or brought in the Idol of <hi>Iupiter Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi>
&amp;c. Answ. It is manifest that he has prophaned
Gods Temple, I mean, the Church of Christ, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Heathenish customs and Idolatrous practices
into it, as is abundantly known; and as for robbery
or sacrilege, the most precious treasure the Church
has he despoils them of, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word of God, or
the Law of God, of which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> says, they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59418:97"/>
               <hi>are more precious</hi> to him <hi>than thousands of Gold and
Silver.</hi> To say nothing of what are called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> Ch. 9. v. 21. and depriving
the living Temple of God of their livelihoods upon
pretence of their Heresie, not permitting them to
buy and fell that receive not the mark of the Beast.
And that the Popes have affected the title of God
has been also above noted, they accepting of it by
not reproving their Flatterers, as neither did <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
when they called him God. <hi>Qui non vetat pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care
cum possit, jubet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that nothing may be wanting to compleat the
Parallelism, he when he brings himself into the
Temple of God, and behaves himself <hi>as to absolute
Power</hi> as if he were God, as it is said in the Epistle
to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> he being but a man, what can
this man be but an Idol, the fulminant <hi>Iupiter</hi> of
Mount <hi>Coelius,</hi> (for that Mountain is appropriate to
the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> upon account of the <hi>Lateran</hi> there,
his Palace) as that Idol <hi>Antiochus</hi> brought into the
Temple of the <hi>Iews,</hi> was <hi>Iupiter</hi> of Mount <hi>Olympus,</hi>
by which the Poets understand Heaven, <hi>Coelum,</hi> from
whence Mount <hi>Coelius</hi> is so called, that the Names
may have also some little correspondency as well as
the things. But if this seem too quaint and operose,
let the intelligent consider whether the bringing <hi>one</hi>
Idol into the Temple of the <hi>Iews,</hi> or the filling of
the Christian Church with <hi>thousands</hi> of Idols and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the people to worship them, which the Papal
Hierarchy does, be the greater affront to the Prince
of Princes, to God and Christ, who is King of Kings
and Lord of Lords, and has expresly commanded,
<hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven Image,
Thou shalt not bow down to them nor worship them.

                  <hi>But he shall be broken without hand.</hi> Morbo divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus
immisso,</hi> says <hi>Grotius,</hi> God inflicting a sore
disease upon him. For, to be done <hi>without hand,</hi> in
Scripture phrase signifies to be done not by <hi>humane</hi>
but by <hi>divine power,</hi> as the Stone cut out without
hands, Ch. 4. And <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> upon this
passage [but he shall be broken without hand] <hi>Sic
Antichristum Christus,</hi> says he, <hi>occidet spiritu oris
sui, 2 Thess.</hi> 2. 8. For he had said before upon Ver. 23.
That <hi>Antiochus</hi> in many things was the Type of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
following the opinion of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
therein, <hi>Irenaeus, Origen</hi> and others. And <hi>Gasper
Sanctius</hi> acknowledges that <hi>Antiochus</hi> was <hi>viva quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
Imago Antichristi,</hi> a lively image of Antichrist,
and is so throughout to the very last stroke according
to that intimation of <hi>Cornelius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the very circumstances of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his death,
as it is described, will notably sute with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the extinction of the Papal Hierarchy,
2 <hi>Maccab. 9. 9. The worms rose up out of the body of
this wicked man</hi> (Antiochus) <hi>and whilest he lived in
sorrow and pain, his flesh fell away, and the filthiness
of his smell was noisome to all his Army.</hi> But thus he
died, <hi>percussus faetore &amp; vermibus,</hi> as <hi>Cornelius</hi> phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it upon the place. And as <hi>Antiochus</hi> went out
thus with a stink, so in all likelihood the exstinction
of the Papal Hierarchy will leave no good favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it, but end in wretched contempt; according
as it is predicted touching the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> no
doubt a Type of the Pope or Papal Hierarchy, <hi>Isa.</hi> 14.
18. <hi>All the Kings of the Nations even all of them lie
in glory, every one of them in his House. But thou
art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,—
as a carcase troden under foot. Thou shalt not be joyned

with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy
land and slain thy people,</hi> massacred, killed, consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in Prison, and burnt at the Stake many Hundred
thousands of Apostolick Christians for not complying
with the worship of those Idols which this King of
<hi>Babylon</hi> had set up, and also filled all Christendom
with bloud upon other squables. Let that be for one
instance amongst the rest which I above-named, That
those Two Emperours <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
the First, fought above Threescore Battles in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

Empire stirred up to Arms by the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
See my Exposition of that Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah</hi> in my
<hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> Book 2. Ch. 17. But enough
has been said to shew how lively an Image <hi>Antiochus

<hi>Christians</hi> as <hi>Iews,</hi> are concerned in this Vision.</p>
            <p>26. <hi>And the Uision of the Evening and Morning
which was told is true. <hi>Explicatio visi,</hi>

Wherefore [is true] here signifies, is not aenigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
or symbolical, the 2300 days are not symbols
of so many years as elsewhere, which <hi>Calvin</hi> also
observes, but are to be taken in the literal sense as
was above declared, though the other part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation

also a further meaning touching Antichrist. But it

say, Having exactly writ this Vision with the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
lock it up safely, that the Original may be
kept to compare with the Event. So <hi>Grotius</hi> as well
as <hi>Cornelius à Lapide,</hi> and <hi>Calvin. <hi>For it shall be for
many days,</hi>
               </hi> The time from the Prophecy to the Event
will be a long time, betwixt Three and Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

Epiphanes</hi> is about 380 years.</p>
            <p>27. <hi>And I Daniel fainted and was sick certain

immediately <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> after <hi>Cyrus</hi> Nephew to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59418:102"/>
had taken <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Belshazzar</hi> was slain.
Wherefore <hi>Darius</hi> was invested in the Kingdom of
<hi>Babylon, Cyrus</hi> his Nephew delivering it to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then about Sixty two years of Age. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he lived from his infancy in <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s
Court, and <hi>Nicrotis Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Wife was
his Sister, and was brought up as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s
Son, and so haply called out of Courtship, the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi>
Empire seems still to have been continued in
his Reign, and he fitly to be called the King of the
<hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet here styles him.</p>
            <p>And yet notwithstanding <hi>Daniel</hi> comparing the
<hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity and the extirpation of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>'s
race by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> and that,
<hi>Cyrus</hi> being Commander in the war, by name so
predicted by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> he comparing these
things, I say, with the commencement and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Empire of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and his Sons,
predefined by <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet, and with the time
himself was first made captive, which was in the
Fourth year of <hi>Iehojakim</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the first
of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> when he was sent by his Father
<hi>Nabopolassar</hi> with Regal power against <hi>Aegypt,</hi> it
came then into his mind that the expiration of the
Seventy years Captivity of the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> was
near at hand, as it appears in the following Verse.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In the first year of his Reign I Daniel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the Books.</hi> For there was in the hands
of the <hi>Iews</hi> then the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets,
that they might know their transgression, punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and time of appointed mercy. <hi>The number
of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to
Ieremiah the Prophet, <hi>Ier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>m.</hi> 25. 11. 12. And this
whole Land shall be a desolation and astonishment; and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59418:103"/>
it shall come to pass when Seventy years are accomplished
I will punish the King of</hi> Babylon, &amp;c. And the whole
race of his Sons was exstinct in <hi>Belshazzar</hi> killed at
the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus.</hi> And Ch. 27. ver. 7.
<hi>And all Nations,</hi> says he, <hi>shall serve him, and his
Son, and his Son's Son until the very time of his land
come.</hi> And there was but Three successions, <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>
himself, <hi>Evil-Merodac</hi> his Son, and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar</hi>
his Son's Son, (according to the words of the
Prophet) slain at <hi>Cyrus</hi> his taking of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Of
whom <hi>Isaiah</hi> foretold by name what a Friend he
would be to the <hi>Iews, Isa. 44. 28. That saith of</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
<hi>He is my Shepherd,</hi> &amp;c. That also of <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
Ch. 29. v. 10. is very express, <hi>Thus saith the Lord of
Hosts, That after Seventy years be accomplished at</hi>
Babylon, <hi>I will visit you and perform my good word
toward you, in causing you to return to this place.</hi>
Wherefore <hi>Daniel</hi> seeing so plainly from these places
of the Prophet sent to the <hi>Iews</hi> by God, <hi>That he
would accomplish Seventy years in the desolations
of Ierusalem,</hi> and then relaxate their Captivity, and
observing also that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had now appeared, and cut
off the race of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and reckoning from
the time of his own Captivity and the beginning
of the Reign of the Kings of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he did ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
conceive hopes that the day of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was now nigh at hand, and accordingly he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
himself to his devotions to hasten it as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>And I set my Face unto the Lord God, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi>
Toward the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as he did, Ch. 6.
v. 10. which is a demonstration it is no Idolatry to
direct a Mans devotions towards one certain place.
<hi>To seek by Prayer and Supplication with Fasting
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59418:103"/>
and Sackcloth and Ashes.</hi> Not lazily expecting,
as if, because God had once promised, he would be
faithfull and be sure to perform it, let us behave our
selves as we will, but preparing himself (for I look
upon him as the Representative here of all the people
of the <hi>Iews)</hi> by earnest Prayer, hearty Repentance,
and sincere Humiliation, and fitting himself thus, to
receive so great a mercy and blessing. Which sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
piety of <hi>Daniel,</hi> all those that wait for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
of God's people from the Captivity of the
Mystical <hi>Babylon</hi> should set themselves faithfully and
conscientiously to imitate, and break off their sins by
Repentance, and make it their business that the <hi>Man
of Sin</hi> may be slain in <hi>themselves,</hi> and the Spirit of
everlasting Righteousness and holy Love be raised in
them, and then will it come to pass, that even the
<hi>external Antichrist</hi> will be consumed by the breath of
Christ's mouth, and by the brightness of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Not by might,</hi> that is, not by an Army, <hi>nor by
power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
This was the word of the Lord to <hi>Zerubbabel, Zach.</hi>
4. 6. No force nor rebellion becomes the people of
God in their Captivity under the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
as <hi>Ieremy</hi> also inculcates unto them. But they are
patiently to wait till some good Prince, like <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
moved by the good Spirit of God and their own good
behaviour do relaxate their Captivity; in the mean
time they are to be obedient to the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
in all Secular matters, but as for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to be as firm in it as <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and
made my Confession and said, O Lord, the great
and dreadfull God.</hi> Which expressions shew with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59418:104"/>
what fear and reverence we are to make our addresses
to him, and that from our very heart and inward
sense, not in words and composed looks only. <hi>Kéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Covenant and mercy,</hi> that is, The mercifull
Promise in particular of redeeming thy People from
the <hi>Babylonian</hi> bondage. <hi>To them that love him,
and to them that kéep his Commandments. <hi>i.e.</hi>
               </hi>
If we were fitted for so great a blessing by unfeigned
Love and Obedience to him.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>But, We have sinned and have committed ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
—The whole Prayer and Confession fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
is plain of it self, and wants no interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
only we may observe from the very form, <hi>We
have sinned,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>Daniel</hi> here sustains a publick
Person, and represents the whole Body of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
as I noted before; we will pass therefore to the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Verse.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>And whiles I was speaking, and praying,
and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
This passage also shews that <hi>Daniel</hi> in his
Prayer represented the whole Body of the people of
the <hi>Iews.</hi> Which he did certainly with the profoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
humility and the purest sincerity conceivable,
as all such addresses in such like circumstances are to
be made. <hi>And presenting my Supplications before
the Lord my God, for the Holy Mountain of my God,</hi>
that is, For the restoring of the exercise of their
Religion to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the rebuilding of the
Temple.</p>
            <p>21. <hi>Yea whiles I was speaking in Prayer, even
the man Gabriel, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> The Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> in humane
shape. Behold the efficacy of humble, earnest, and
sincere Devotion, that by a kind of Divine Magick
does attract unto the Supplicant, not only the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59418:104"/>
illapses of the Holy Spirit within, but also the
external and visible converse of Angels. <hi>Whom I
had seen in the Uision at the beginning,</hi> namely,
at <hi>Susa</hi> near the River <hi>Vlai</hi> or <hi>Vlaeus,</hi> Ch. 8. v. 16.
<hi>Being caused to fly swiftly.</hi> As if Angels were
winged Creatures. But they are so described only
to signifie the speed of their ministry. <hi>Touched me
about the time of the Evening oblation,</hi> that is,
About the Ninth hour of the day, the time hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
while the Temple stood, allotted for Sacrifices,
and now the Temple was down, it was made choice
of by the <hi>Iews</hi> for the time of Prayer, which is a
more Spiritual sacrifice.</p>
            <p>22. <hi>And he informed me, and talked with me
and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give
thée skill and understanding,</hi> namely, Touching his
People, Religion and Temple, for which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
with so much zeal and earnestness.</p>
            <p>23. <hi>At the beginning of the Supplications the
Commandment came forth.</hi> Thou hadst no sooner
set thy Face to seek God in behalf of thy People,
thy Religion, and the Holy Mountain, but it was
given to me in charge to come unto thee. <hi>And I
am come to shew thée,</hi> Not only how <hi>Cyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s</hi> King of
<hi>Persia</hi> will relaxate your Captivity, but how the
<hi>Messias</hi> the true <hi>Shepherd</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> will come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxate
his people from the Captivity of Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
<hi>For thou art greatly beloved.</hi> That is one
sense of the Hebrew Text which <hi>verbatim</hi> is, <hi>Thou
art a man of desires,</hi> which may signifie as well
actively as passively, and denote the earnestness of
his Spirit in matters that concerned the glory of
God, and the welfare of his People. Which holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
is, as I said, a certain Divine Magick of the soul
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59418:105"/>
to attract the influences of the Spirit of God, and the
ministry of Angels. <hi>Therefore understand the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and consider the Uision, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> This Prophecy
here ensuing of the Seventy Weeks, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
called a <hi>Vision</hi> in such a general notion as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
are called <hi>Seers.</hi> It is <hi>Grotius</hi> his note upon the
Text; <hi>Nam ut Prophetae</hi> Videntes, <hi>ita omne Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae
genus, quocunque modo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>omini innotescat,</hi> Visio <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur.</hi>
Which Vision of <hi>Daniel</hi> considered well, it
does more than abundantly answer the Scope of his
Prayers, which concerned only the relaxation of the
<hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, for which they obtained a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
in the very first year of the Reign of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But
in the ensuing Vision, as it is called, there is granted
them the injoyment of their Religion and Laws for
the space of about Five hundred years, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the coming of their <hi>Messias</hi> for greater pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
than were otherwise ever designed for the People
of God. This might <hi>Daniel</hi> collect by understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the matter, and considering the ensuing Vision,
which is this:</p>
            <p>24. <hi>Seventy Wéeks.</hi> That Seventy Weeks of
years are understood, and that it is as much as if he
should have said 490 years, all Interpreters are agreed,
as well <hi>Iew</hi> as <hi>Christian.</hi> But the very number of these
Prophetick Weeks, which consists of <hi>Ten</hi> Septenaries
of Septenaries, or <hi>Ten</hi> Weeks of Weeks, seems not
to want its Mystery. For a Septenary of Septena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or Week of Weeks Prophetically understood is
49 years, which is the <hi>Iewish Iubilee</hi> consisting of
Seven Sabbaths of years, so that every Forty ninth
year was, as the <hi>Sept<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>agint</hi> render it, their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
It was the year of <hi>Iubilee</hi> wherein whose
Lands were gone from him were restored again to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59418:105"/>
him; His Lands that were mortgaged as it were
before, were then released <hi>Gratis.</hi> Now these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Weeks being Ten Jubilees (for Ten times 49
is 490) and the number Ten a note of perfection, as
<hi>Alcazar</hi> observes, what are these Seventy Weeks of
<hi>Daniel</hi> but the most perfect <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the
bringing in the most compleat Jubilee conceivable,
that is, our being restor'd to our Heavenly Inheritance
by the coming of the <hi>Messias?</hi> For this is the main
upshot of them. <hi>Are determined.</hi> The Hebrew word
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>cut out,</hi> as some would have it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
that immediately after the expiration of these,
the <hi>Iews</hi> would into Captivity again. But that is a
curiosity more than needs, and not so conformable to
the sense of the Prophecy. So that in my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the English translation has the odds of it. <hi>Upon
thy People and upon thy Holy City,</hi> that is to say,
Near upon the expiration of the Seventieth Week
the People of the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be no longer the People
of God, nor the City Holy; their Religion natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ceasing upon some act of theirs, whereby a
better according to the purpose of God shall be
brought in. But from the commencement of the
Seventy Weeks till that time which is nigh 500 years,
they should be the People of God, and their City ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Holy, which is a fair space of time and
ought to be welcome news to <hi>Daniel. <hi>To finish
transgression,</hi>
               </hi> that is, To consume Sin and make an
end of it. For to that end Christ came who bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
all true Believers with the Holy Ghost and with
Fire; or, who throughly purges his Floor, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the Chaff with fire unquenchable, as <hi>Iohn</hi> the
<hi>Baptist</hi> witnesseth of him: And he of himself, <hi>That
he came to pluck up every Plant that was not of his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59418:106"/>
Father's planting.</hi> And such sure is all manner of sin
and unrighteousness. But the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, may
signifie to compleat transgression. And it seems
as naturall a sense in this place. As if the Angel
should say, Seventy Weeks shall the Scourge be taken
from thy People, wherein notwithstanding they will
again follow their own evil ways, and increase their
sins to the very height, which they did the most noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
in killing their <hi>Messiah. <hi>And to make an end
of Sins,</hi>
               </hi> Or to put an end to the <hi>Iudaical</hi> Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
For so will <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifie, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which
is as much as <hi>to Seal,</hi> denotes a putting an end to
a thing by fulfilling and compleating it, as toward
the latter end of this Verse to <hi>Seal up Vision and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi>
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is used. And surely Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
on the Cross for the Sins of the World was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of all Sin-offerings. <hi>And to make reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

But the sense is much-what the same in both. And
that Christ is that great Expiation and Atonement for
Sin all true Believers are agreed on. <hi>And to bring in
everlasting Righteousness.</hi> Such a Law or Religion
as shall endure for ever, and according to which if

of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> in the Twentieth year of

of him, who made his complaint to him, how
the place of his Father's Sepulchers lay waste, that is,
the City <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Gates thereof were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
with fire, according as <hi>Hanani</hi> had told him,
<hi>Nehem. 1. 3. That the Wall of Ierusalem was broken
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59418:107"/>
down, and the Gates thereof burnt with Fire.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chap. 2. ver. 1. in the Twentieth year of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
his Reign he obtained a Decree for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing

granted by <hi>Cyrus, Darius Hystaspis,</hi> and by
this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in the Seventh year of his Reign,
concerned only the Temple, not the City and the
Walls, as you may plainly discern by reading of
<hi>Ezra.</hi> Whence it is manifest that the Epocha of the
Seventy Weeks must be taken from this Decree of
the Twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> But Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Divines have been discouraged there-from,
because they could not adjust the time from thence
to the Passion of Christ, it shooting many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it, and so they were content to take up with
the seventh year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> from which the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Weeks end in the Passion of Christ according
to <hi>Funccius</hi> and others. But our Country-man <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Lydiat,</hi> has adjusted the Chronology of Times
so, that from this <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Twentieth of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
the Passion will fall in the middle of the last
Week, which is exquisitely according to the predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Prophecy, as we shall hear anon. <hi>Unto
Messiah the Prince,</hi> that is, Unto the manifestation
of that Person that is so well known and so much
expected by the <hi>Iews</hi> under the name of their <hi>Messiah,</hi>
the word never being used absolutely but concerning
him. To the initiation therefore of him into his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,

of the <hi>Messiah, <hi>Shall be seven Wéeks and threescore
and two Wéeks,</hi>
               </hi> that is, Sixty nine Weeks, there

being no mystery in the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

Ch. 45. v. 12. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. often in that Chapter,
as also Ch. 8. v. 3. as <hi>Grotius</hi> comments upon the
place. In the last day of the Sixty ninth Week, that
is, in the Four hundred eighty third year from the
Twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> did <hi>Iesus</hi> the
<hi>Messiah</hi> manifest himself according to <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi>'s
Chronology, whom I conceive to have hit the nail
on the head in this business. <hi>The stréet shall be built
again and the wall.</hi> This seems to be added on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to give light to Interpreters that the Decree here
mentioned from whence the Weeks do commence, is
the Decree granted in the Twentieth year of <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes,</hi>
because that was expresly for the City and
the Wall, the other Three that preceeded for the
Temple. The sense is, That not only the <hi>Area</hi> of
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> shall again be replenished with Houses,
but the Wall shall also be built again. <hi>Even in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
times,</hi> As it appears out of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Ch. 4.
For the Builders were fain to have their Swords in
readiness as well as their Trowels.</p>
            <p>26. <hi>And after thréescore and two Wéeks shall
Messiah be cut off,</hi> namely, After the Sixty two
Weeks which succeed immediately the Seven Weeks,
that is to say, after Sixty nine Weeks shall <hi>Messiah</hi> be
cut off, <hi>viz.</hi> The above-named <hi>Messiah</hi> the Prince.
For that must needs be the natural meaning thereof;
and, as I said before, <hi>Messiah</hi> is never put thus abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
but here; whence doubtlesly the <hi>Iews</hi> gave
him, whom they expected for their Redeemer, the
name of <hi>Messiah.</hi> And now for [cut off] if it were
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Original it might signifie <hi>transfixus,</hi> or

               </gap>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:59418:108"/>
which signifies to cut off, not only from life, but as
Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> says, from reigning as a King. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the <hi>Iews</hi> he was cut off in both these senses.
For he was the <hi>Messias</hi> their Prince whom his own
people rejected and cut off from life, and thereby
from themselves that they should be no more his
people, nor he their King. <hi>But not for himself.</hi>
The Hebrew is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and most easily and naturally

that cut him off or crucified him, the People of the

Threescore and second Week, or rather the Sixty
ninth and before the Seventieth expire, that part of
the Prophecy as to time would be fulfilled if there were
no more accurate determination intimated, as there
seems to be here, and that he is to be cut off in the
midst of the last Week, suppose in the fourth year
thereof. Whis is the scope that <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi> has
aimed at, and, as I conceive, hit the mark. Which
makes me now less adhering to that laxe sense of
[in the midst] which I set down in my <hi>Mystery of
Godliness,</hi> on this Verse. Wherefore about the fourth
year of the last Week of years shall the <hi>Messiah,</hi> by
suffering on the Cross, put an end to the <hi>Iewish</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
and oblations. For he that was prefigured
by them being come, and having been sacrificed and
made an oblation, it is plain those other ceased as to
right and efficacy, that is, were abrogated or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by the excellency of his Person, who offered up
himself once a-sacrifice and atonement for the sins of
the whole world. The main drift therefore of the
Prophecy is more curiously to define the time, as
of his <hi>Manifestation,</hi> so likewise of the <hi>Death</hi> of the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> which I question not but may very well be
hinted at here in this expression, [he shall cause the
sacrifice and oblation to cease,] and what was spoke
more at large and more undeterminately in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Verse, touching his being cut off, may here,
<hi>For time,</hi> be more punctually defined. And as at the
mention of his death before there was annexed that
vengeance upon them that murthered him, so here
where it is repeated again, the same vengeance is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
as follows. <hi>And for the over-spreading of

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59418:109"/>
would render thus, <hi>And commanding over a wing of
abominations he will be a destroyer, i.e.</hi> over an army
of Idolatrous <hi>Gentiles,</hi> namely, the <hi>Roman</hi> Army. And
the coming of the <hi>Romans</hi> to destroy the City of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
is in several places of the <hi>New Testament</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
* the <hi>coming of Christ.</hi> So well fitted is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
to the nature of the thing. See
also <hi>Grotius</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 15. whose Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
though it differ something from Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s.
yet in my opinion does confirm it very much, he
proving by several citations out of Authours that the
<hi>Romans</hi> bore upon their Standards the Images of their
Gods, which in the Hebrew is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. We shall
only instance in that one of many out of <hi>Tacitus,
Fulgentibus Aquilis Signisque &amp; Simulacris Deûm in
modum Templi.</hi> So fitly is this wing of abominations
interpreted of an army of Idolaters. <hi>Even until the
consummation and that determined,</hi> Read out of the
Hebrew, <hi>And until the consummation, i.e.</hi> the finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this destruction, <hi>Shall be poured upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate,</hi>
Read out of the Original. <hi>It shall continue
upon the distressed, viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> shall do so. The
<hi>Roman</hi> Army shall continue upon <hi>Ierusalem</hi> till they
have brought it to utter devastation. Or it shall be
spread like water poured out upon the desolate, in
that sense that Inundation was interpreted in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Verse. For, as I intimated before, this is but
a repeated prediction of the same vengeance upon the
fame occasion, namely, upon the consideration of their
murthering the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which is implied in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
[He shall make the sacrifice and oblation
to cease,] himself then becoming a sacrifice for the
sins of the whole world, according to the eternal
counsel of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59418:110"/>The sense which we have given of this Prophecy
is so coherent and of one piece, though taken out of
several Interpreters, that no sense can be applied to
any Writing more naturally. So that if Chronology
will but favour the Interpretation of this Prophecy,
it is most certain that what we have given is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the true meaning thereof. * And the Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
part <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi> in my judgment has made
out accurately well, of which I shall say something in
my <hi>Notes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The goods news therefore that the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi>
imparts to <hi>Daniel</hi> in this Prophecy is this, That they
should return out of Captivity and that from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth of a certain Decree to rebuild <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
even with the Wall thereof, that from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God had determined Seventy Weeks for them,
that he would give them his special Protection so
long, and they should be his People, and their City
should be Holy, their oblations and sacrifices should
not be antiquated, nor their Law and Religion ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated.
But within that time a <hi>new Law</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi>
should begin, which should <hi>never have an end,</hi> which
therefore is called the <hi>everlasting Righteousness,</hi> and
that the <hi>Iudaical</hi> Sin-offerings should then cease, that
is, should be no longer warrantable or effectual. For
the <hi>Messiah</hi> should by that time be come, whom they
will slay, and he shall by his death put an end to
all other sacrifices, his bloud being sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the whole world to God. But though the
design of Divine Providence herein was holy and
good, yet the <hi>Iews</hi> crucifying him out of malice and
envy (enormous wickedness having blinded their
eyes,) the People of the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be cast out of God's
favour, nor shall they be the People of the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:59418:110"/>
but a People that shall be the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
shall come and destroy their City and Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with an <hi>utter</hi> destruction.</p>
            <p>This is a short and easie account of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
in which it plainly appears, That the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
of the destruction of the City is but an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix
of the main Prophecy, and comes but in by the
by, as an effect of that soul act of the <hi>Iews</hi> in slaying
their Prince: But that the circumscription of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
Weeks is made by those main designs they
were allotted to the <hi>Iews</hi> for, that is, they should
not expire till the <hi>everlasting Righteousness</hi> was brought
in, till the <hi>Prophecies</hi> were <hi>fulfilled,</hi> and the <hi>most Holy
anointed,</hi> that is, till the <hi>Messias</hi> was <hi>manifested</hi> to
the world, till he <hi>suffered, rose again, ascended</hi> into
Heaven, <hi>sent</hi> down the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> upon the Apostles,
and set the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> on foot in the world.
All which was done in the last Week. After which
the City was to be destroyed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> but
there was no need of precisely setting down the time
when. It came to pass by <hi>Titus</hi> the Son of <hi>Vespasian</hi>
about Thirty years after the expiration of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s
Weeks.</p>

I find his short note to be, <hi>Tempore</hi> Artaxerxis,
<hi>is est</hi> Assuerus. So that <hi>Assuerus</hi> is but a general
expression for a <hi>Xerxes</hi> or Monarch of <hi>Persia</hi> at large,
but the person is determinated in <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> by
whom <hi>Cambyses,</hi> as being so early in the beginning

<hi>Lord what shall this man do,</hi> speaking of the beloved

little a time as to the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> when he sent
down the Holy Ghost and was with them in that
assistance, nor of so long a time as his coming to the

things so peculiar in his chief Commander over the
Army, as if he were pickt out on purpose or so qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified

might easily believe that he was Jesus Christ his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59418:113"/>and that he by him and his Army came to take
vengeance on the <hi>Iews.</hi> As that he healed the Blind
and the Lame with Spittle and touch, That he was
one of the most humble and mild men then breathing,
which is the very character of Christ, That he shut
the Gate of <hi>Ianus</hi> his Temple and erected a Temple
of Peace, like a Lieutenant of that Prince of Peace
the Blessed Jesus, That after the taking <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and
vanquishing the <hi>Iews</hi> neither he nor his Son would
be named <hi>Iudaicus,</hi> as other Conquerours usually

                  <hi>And the Chronological part</hi> Thomas Lydiat <hi>in my
judgment,</hi> &amp;c.] A general account of <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi>
his performance in this point I have given in my
Latin <hi>Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness,
lib. 7. cap. 4. sect.</hi> 5. which I will translate hither with
some emendation. The summ of his Method is this.
Forasmuch as he makes the beginning of the Reign
of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> Six years sooner than
<hi>Funccius</hi> does (who places it in the Fourth year of
the 78 Olympiad, but <hi>Lydiat</hi> in the Second year of
the Olympiad 77,) it is plain that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Seventy
Weeks from the Thirteenth year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Lydiat</hi>'s Epocha) will have the same end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as before from <hi>Funccius</hi> his, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Third
year of the 202 Olympiad. So that if the Passion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59418:113"/>of Christ, as <hi>Funccius</hi> would have it, fell out upon the
expiration of the last year of the last week accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own Epocha, which <hi>Helvicus</hi> also inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
namely, that Christ suffered <hi>Anno quarto</hi>
Olympiad. 202. We computing from <hi>Thomas Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat</hi>'s
Epocha, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Twentieth year of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes
Longimanus,</hi> the Passion will fall on the
First year of his last week, which is immediatly
next to the last of <hi>Funccius</hi> his, if the Passion fell
out no later than they would have it. Wherefore
the rest of the Artifice of <hi>Lydiat</hi>'s Method is spent
in proving the Passion of Christ to have fallen
out about Three or Four years later than vulgarly
they reckon, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Twenty second year of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>
(whenas others reckon it to have fallen out
in the Nineteenth of his Reign) and consequently
to have happened in the midst of the last Week, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy. This is that general
account I give for the main, in the abovesaid place
of my <hi>Mystery of Godliness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here, for the better satisfaction of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I shall briefly intimate the main reasons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi> proves, First, That <hi>Artaxerxes
Longimanus</hi> began his Reign Six years sooner than
others account; and Secondly, That the <hi>Birth, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi>
and <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ fell out several years
later.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Reign began Six years soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than others reckon, he makes out thus. <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes</hi>
began his Reign about Six months before the
Flight of <hi>Themistocles</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> according to the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> the chief of the Heathen Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians:
For, <hi>Themistocles</hi> in his flight, according to
him, being tossed upon the Sea a day and night at
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59418:114"/>anchor, that he might not be driven into the Army
of the <hi>Athenians</hi> then besieging the people of <hi>Naxos,</hi>
whom they subdued, as the same <hi>Thucydides</hi> writes,
before that twofold famous Victory against the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
by Sea and Land in the same day on the Coast
of <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and near the shores of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> under
<hi>Cimon</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> General; Which Victory they
obtained, according to <hi>Diodorus</hi> his own testimony,
on the Third year of the 77. Olympiad, himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the flight of <hi>Themistocles</hi> to the former year,
<hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>second</hi> of the 77. Olympiad: I say, it is plain
from hence, that the beginning of this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his
Reign was Six years sooner than <hi>Funccius,</hi> and others
do place it, the Argument being founded upon the
unexceptionable Authority of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> of whom
<hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Themistocles</hi> writes thus. That
<hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Charon Lamplacenus</hi> record, that
<hi>Xerxes</hi> being dead, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
that <hi>Themistocles</hi> had the communication
with his Son, <hi>viz. Artaxerxes.</hi> And <hi>Plutarch</hi> adds, that
though others write that the said conference was with
his Father <hi>Xerxes,</hi> yet he prefers <hi>Thucydides</hi> his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
as being more agreeing with the Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of those times. And so <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> prefers
his Authority in this matter before all others, <hi>Quòd

               <p>Now for the <hi>Birth, Baptism,</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59418:114"/>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks reaching from <hi>Lydiat</hi>'s Epocha, which
is the Twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> (which is Seven years
later than the Seventh in their Epocha, or the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of his own) reaching, I say, Seven years beyond
<hi>Funccius</hi> his Expiration of them, so that the year
next after the last Week, with <hi>Funccius,</hi> is the first
of the last with <hi>Lydiat,</hi> it was requisite for <hi>Lydiat</hi>
to set the <hi>Birth, Baptism</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> of our Saviour
several years later than others account them, that his
<hi>Death</hi> may fall out in the midst of the last Week.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, whereas <hi>Funccius</hi> and <hi>Helvicus</hi> also
placed the Birth of Christ in the year when <hi>C.
Lent. Getulicus</hi> and <hi>M. Messalinus</hi> were Consuls,
and others sooner as well as other-some later. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Lydiat</hi> places his <hi>Birth</hi> in the latest date of all,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the year when <hi>L. Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>M. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius
Geminus</hi> were Consuls. Which is Four years
later than that Date of <hi>Func<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ius,</hi> which is in the
<hi>Third</hi> year of the 194 Olympiad, that in the <hi>Third</hi>
of the 195. The first ground of his Evidence is,
That the Birth of our Saviour happened in that Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical
Tax appointed by <hi>Augustus,</hi> and menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<hi>Luke</hi> 2. and executed by <hi>Cyrenius</hi> then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Syria.</hi> Now we are to understand that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
in his Reign appointed three universal Taxes
of the Citizens and People of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
which <hi>Suetonius</hi> intimates in his Life, Cap. 27. <hi>Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>erio
Collega.</hi> The middle Tax was that which was begun
by his appointment in the year of <hi>P. Vinitius</hi> and
<hi>P. Alfinius Varus,</hi> but finished, <hi>Aelius Catus</hi> and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59418:115"/>
                  <hi>Sentius Saturninus</hi> being Consuls, as <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi>
makes good out of History. And that it is that
middle Tax of <hi>Augustus</hi> that the Evangelist <hi>Luke</hi>
points at, is plain, in that the first and last are too
far removed to pretend to be the Tax at what time
Christ was born. And besides, the year before the
beginning of this Tax, <hi>Caius Caesar</hi> and <hi>Aemylius
Paulus</hi> being Consuls, the Gates of <hi>Ianus Quirinius</hi>
were the third time shut up by <hi>Augustus,</hi> and it is
a tradition of the antient Fathers, that Christ was
born in such a time of Peace. Moreover in the
beginning of the Consulship of <hi>Vinitius</hi> and <hi>Alfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
was the twenty eighth of <hi>Augustus</hi> his obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Title, together with that supream and Sacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanct
<hi>Tribunitial</hi> power, and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi>
expresly says, that <hi>Augustus</hi> his Tax and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Birth was in the Twenty eighth year of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
his Reign. And lastly, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> farther to
confirm the other, says, our Saviour was born in
the twenty ninth year after the <hi>Iews</hi> were perfectly
joyned with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Iudaea</hi> fully reduced
under Tribute, so that they had paid Tribute to
the <hi>Romans</hi> these nine and twenty years, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
after the fourth year of <hi>Herod</hi> his being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
King by <hi>Augustus;</hi> Forasmuch as so many
entire years, says <hi>Thomas Lydiat,</hi> intervene from
the first Tax of <hi>Augustus;</hi> peracted, himself the sixth
time and <hi>Agrippa</hi> the second time being Consuls,
to his second Tax instituted, <hi>Vinitius</hi> and <hi>Alfinius</hi>
being Consuls. To this purpose does <hi>Thomas Lydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at</hi>
argue, to prove that our Saviour was born in the
time of the second Tax of <hi>Augustus,</hi> which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<hi>Vinitius</hi> and <hi>Alfinius,</hi> and ended <hi>Aelius Catus</hi>
and <hi>Sentius Saturninus</hi> being Consuls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:59418:115"/>But not content with this, he further proves, that
Christ was born in the very middle year of this Tax,
<hi>L. Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>M. Servilius Geminus</hi> being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls,
and <hi>P. Sulpitius Quirinius</hi> or <hi>Cyrenius</hi> being
then Governour of <hi>Syria;</hi> and that the first Tax that
he medled in, as the Greek, <hi>Luke 2. v.</hi> 2. will very
well bear it, expunging the Comma betwixt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Now the year of these Consuls <hi>Aelius Lamia</hi> and
<hi>Servilius Geminus</hi> is the 41 year of the Reign of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
to be computed from the Consulship of <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi>
and <hi>Flaccus,</hi> (which is the <hi>Aera Hispanica in To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
Conciliorum,</hi> as <hi>Helvicus</hi> notes,) but in this 41 year
of <hi>Augustus</hi> was Christ born, according to the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others, which is
no mean argument in a matter of this nature.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>P. Quirinius</hi> was sent Rectour or Tutour
by <hi>Augustus</hi> to <hi>Caius Caesar</hi> after he had gotten <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia.</hi>
For <hi>M. Lollius,</hi> the former Tutor of <hi>Caius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead a little before <hi>Tiberius</hi> his return out of
<hi>Rhodes,</hi> which was when <hi>Vinitius</hi> and <hi>Alfinius</hi>
were Consuls; and <hi>Caius</hi> after his renewing his
confederacy with the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and gone again
into <hi>Armenia,</hi> being in an heedless conference trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously
wounded, and thereby disinabled as well
in mind as body to attend publick affairs: from
hence there can be no doubt, since <hi>Luke</hi> affirms
this Tax to be carried on <hi>Quirinius</hi> or <hi>Cyrenius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Governour of <hi>Syria</hi> or guiding the affairs there,
and that <hi>Caius</hi> was thus unhinged, (who indeed
died within a year after that disaster) there can
be no doubt I say, but that <hi>Augustus</hi> by this same
<hi>P. Quirinius</hi> at this time, <hi>Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Geminus</hi> being Consuls, carried on the Tax, at
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59418:116"/>what time Christ was born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
coming up thither to be taxed. And that it
is not for nothing called the first Tax of <hi>Quirinius</hi>
to distinguish it from that other, which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
was imployed in, when the Kingdom was
taken from <hi>Archelaus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas <hi>Suslyga</hi> and <hi>Kepler</hi> make that
Tax, under which Christ our Lord was born, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
or interrupted, <hi>Suslyga</hi> for four years from
the Consulate of <hi>Censorinus</hi> and <hi>Asinius,</hi> and <hi>Kepler</hi>
six whole years from the year after the Consulate
of <hi>Quirinius</hi> to the twelfth Consulate of <hi>Augustus</hi>
with <hi>Sylla,</hi> as reaching to <hi>Saturninus</hi> President of
<hi>Syria,</hi> under whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> with all confidence
affirms the said Tax to be finished, I appeal says
<hi>Thomas Lydiat,</hi> to <hi>Kepler</hi>'s Conscience and Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
whether my account, which reducing the Tax
within the space of three years divides it by years
and half years betwixt <hi>Quirinius</hi> and <hi>Sentius,</hi> allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a year and an half to each, so that <hi>Quirinius</hi>
together with his prefecture of <hi>Syria</hi> began to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it on in <hi>Iudaea</hi> in the beginning of the Consulate
of <hi>Alfinius</hi> and <hi>Vinitius,</hi> but <hi>Sentius</hi> succeeding him
and <hi>Caius,</hi> in the midst of the summer (the usual
time of changing the Presidents of Provinces) next
following the Nativity of Christ, <hi>Servilius</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>
being Consuls, that <hi>Sentius,</hi> I say, finished it in
the Consulship of <hi>Aelius Catus</hi> and <hi>Sentius Saturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
his Son in all probability; I appeal, saith he, to
<hi>Kepler</hi> whether this account be not far more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and congruous, than that of <hi>Suslyga,</hi> or his own.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and lastly, for it were too prolix to
take in all; It appears out of <hi>Velleius, Suetonius</hi>
and <hi>Dion,</hi> that <hi>Augustus</hi> adopted <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippas
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59418:116"/>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>s</hi> the junior. But
<hi>Eusebius</hi> in his <hi>Chronicon</hi> places the Nativity of
Christ in the year immediatly preceeding that adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which therefore is the year of <hi>Aelius Lamia</hi>
and <hi>Servilius Geminus</hi> Consuls. These reasons
with others, which for brevities sake I have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
being considered, and how stoutly and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously
<hi>T. L.</hi> has removed all blocks and rubbish
which either <hi>Scaliger, Kepler</hi> or <hi>Suslyga</hi> have cast in
his way, it may convince any unprejudiced man
that reads him, that he is in the truth touching the
time of the Nativity of our blessed Saviour.</p>
               <p>Now for his <hi>Baptism,</hi> whereas they usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to the fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> he places it
in the beginning of the nineteenth, which makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
four years difference again. And indeed consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> began but his Function
(which was to prepare the way to the <hi>Messias)</hi> on
the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as it appears <hi>Luke</hi> 3. and
that Province being of so great moment and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
to wit, <hi>Iohn</hi> his approving of himself so to
all the People that he might be an idoneous Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to our Saviour that was to come after him,
it was requisite that he should exercise his proper
Ministry some competent time before our Saviour
appeared upon the Stage. And who can say that
the space of about four years is more than compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
or superfluous?</p>
               <p>But let us hear <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi>'s own Reasons.
And the first is to that purpose we have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated,
only he adds, that <hi>Iohn</hi> doing no Miracles
and yet having by the exemplarity of his Life and
the Efficacy of his Doctrine drawn the eyes of all
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59418:117"/>so upon him and got such an authority with the
<hi>Iews</hi> and esteem, that they began to think with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that he might be the very <hi>Messias,</hi> so great an
opinion could not be raised in them from one years
experience, but from many; and that it is rashly
gathered from Christ's Baptism being named so soon
in the same Chapter, that it should be in the very first
year of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Ministry, <hi>viz.</hi> in the fifteenth of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius;</hi>
things of far greater distance of time being
spoken of within less compass of lines and no inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
given of the times distance, a thing frequent
in Scripture. So that the time of Christ's Baptism
by <hi>Iohn</hi> is to be defined from other considerations.
And therefore</p>
               <p>The second Reason is, That this nineteenth year
of <hi>Tiberius</hi> exactly complies with the age of Christ
at the time of his Baptism, <hi>Luke Ch. 3. ver. 2. And
Iesus began to be about thirty years of age,</hi> &amp;c. The
Greek has it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is, <hi>And Iesus himself was about
thirty years of age</hi> (namely the age in which the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
began their service <hi>Numb. Ch.</hi> 4.) <hi>beginning</hi> his
Function, which he was initiated into by this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Holy Ghost also then descending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. Now from the year of <hi>Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius
Geminus</hi> Consuls, to the nineteenth of <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
are thirty years, as you may see in Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
So plain an Argument is this for Christ's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Baptized in the nineteenth year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> as
<hi>Lydiat</hi> would have it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes
Longimanus</hi> to this time of the manifestation of Christ
in his Baptism and Ministry are precisely 483 years
or Sixty nine Weeks, according as it said in the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59418:117"/>very Prophecy. That from the abovesaid Decree to
<hi>Messiah</hi> the Prince, <hi>viz.</hi> to his manifestation should be
seven Weeks and threescore and two Weeks, that is,
sixty nine Weeks. And thus is there left one intire
Week <hi>to confirm a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> covenant with many,</hi> first by his
own Preaching the first half of the Week, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by his Apostles, after he had sent down the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost upon them. And let these three first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
serve for a tast, but there are more than thrice
as many congruencies with historical passages that,
<hi>Lydiat</hi> notes in several succeeding years, that do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
confirm this Hypothesis of his, touching our
Saviour's Baptism falling on the nineteenth year of
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> which I must omit, that the Notes upon this
Vision run not out too far.</p>
               <p>Now the time of Christ's <hi>Baptism</hi> is setled, the
time of his <hi>Suffering</hi> will be determined with ease,
and fall in right whether we will or no, taking but
what the generality of Expositors have concluded
on, whom <hi>Funccius</hi> declares to have been of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Christ was between thirty three and thirty
four years old, when he suffered, whence of necessity
his Death falls upon the fourth year of the last Week,
and about the middle of that year. And that he
did not exceed that age is further confirmed by <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Lydiat</hi> in his <hi>Canones Chronici,</hi> p. 93. out of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi>
who expresly says, When our Lord for about
three years and an half had preached and had confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his Disciples by his Doctrine and Miracles, he
suffered. To all which you may add, that there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Christ's Baptism to his suffering but four
Passovers, as is apparent out of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel,
(who writing to make a supply to the omissions
of the other Evangelists, who scarce take notice of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59418:118"/>any Passover but that wherein Christ suffered, would
be sure to omit none from the time of his Baptism to
his Suffering) and Christ being Baptized in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the eighth natural month, that is, of the
Jewish <hi>Marchesvan</hi> or Roman <hi>November,</hi> as <hi>Thomas
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ydiat</hi> notes out of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> Christ's Passion will
necessarily run into the middle year of the last Week
and near upon into the middle of that year, there
being nigh six months space betwixt the beginning
of <hi>Marchesvan</hi> and the middle of <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Nisan</hi>
when the Passover was kept. So handsomely do all
things fall in and agree together.</p>
               <p>And though I have been very brief in opening
the grounds of <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi>'s Chronological ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this Prophecy, yet I hope it is so plain, at
least so considerable, that it may excite the Reader
to seek further satisfaction if he need it from <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Lydiat</hi> himself, and admire with all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
the stupendious providence of God who has left
such clear and wonderfull testimonies thereof unto
his Church in these Books of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse,</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>Which is the Vision of an Angel in human shape clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in Linen with his Loins girt with the fine gold
of Uphaz, Ch. 10. and is a Prooeme or Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Vision of the Scripture of Truth, which
takes up the other two whole Chapters in Daniel.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat the same times are run over again as in
the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> so in this Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and
things more fully explained in the repetition of the
same times, I have noted above. But what is most
remarkable in this present introductory Vision is this,
That the vision of the <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and is a description of Affairs from the times
of the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy to the end of the world,
being of such great importance, (the Affairs of the
Church not only Jewish but Christian being so live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
described therein) that which is most remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
I say is, that as in the Apocalypse to Visions of
like great comprehension and compass, so here to
this Vision of so vast extent of time is there pref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>xt
a very pompous introductory Vision: as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>Seals</hi> which reaches from the
beginning of the Christian Church to the end of the
World, the representation of the throne of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
and of the Four Beasts and the Four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Elders. Before the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>opened Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>k,</hi>
which reaches also from the beginning of the Church
to the Conflagration, there is a Vision of a mighty
strong Angel clothed with a Cloud and a Rain-bow
about his Head, his face as the Sun and his Feet as
pillars of Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. And lastly, before the <hi>Prophecy</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59418:119"/>
of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> which is of the same extent
with the forenamed Prophecies, there is seen in the
midst of the Seven Golden Candlesticks, <hi>One like
unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to
the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdle;
His Head and his Hair was white like Wool as white
as Snow, and his Eyes were as a flame of Fire, and
his Feet like unto fine Brass, and his Voice as the sound
of many Waters.</hi> Which is a representation of Christ
according to the sense of all Interpreters on that
place of the Apocalypse, and the thing is evident
from the Text it self.</p>
            <p>But how like to this description of Christ, in the
Apocalypse, this of the Angel here appearing to
<hi>Daniel</hi> is, I shall take notice in my exposition of
the Vision. I will only observe for the present, that
there being so pompous an Introduction to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> which reaches from
the times of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire to the end of the
World, that there must be most remarkable matters
revealed therein, such as concern not only the <hi>Iews</hi>
but the Christian Church as well as them, or else
the Gate will be too big for the City.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In the Third year of Cyrus King of Persia,</hi>
* namely, in the Third year of the <hi>Persian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
begun upon the death of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> who
immediately succeeded <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> the Grand-child
of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar. <hi>A thing was revealed unto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
(whose name was called Belteshazzar)</hi>
               </hi> There
are Three names that occurr in <hi>Daniel</hi> that sound
like one another in the Hebrew, but are not the
same; The first is of the Grand-child of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
called <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> in the Hebrew it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

which is compounded of <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59418:119"/>

            </p>
            <p>The other two names in Hebrew belong both to
<hi>Daniel,</hi> and have a distinction in writing and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but they are writ alike in the English, <hi>viz.
Belteshazzar,</hi> and so other languages make no discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
But here in the Hebrew the name that was
given to <hi>Daniel</hi> by <hi>Ashpenaz</hi> the Prince of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs,
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which <hi>Iunius</hi> in <hi>Gregorius Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorii</hi>

that thereby what he had predicted did suddenly
and unexpectedly come to pass upon the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
But yet though he a little changed the writing
of his name, the sound being so near that which
was given him by <hi>Ahpenaz</hi> Master of the Eunuchs,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59418:120"/>
he thought fit to record it here as well as his own
genuine name <hi>Daniel,</hi> which by long disuse in those
parts was in a manner buried in oblivion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he thought requisite to record this more known
name of his, that it might be more certain to those
Nations, that this was his Prophecy. To this sense
<hi>Calvin</hi> writes upon the place.</p>
            <p>But indulging to a little liberty and putting <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Belteshazzar</hi> may signify,
<hi>Homo host is in abscondito,</hi> whereby <hi>Daniel</hi> cries quits
with them. For when they would have besmeared
him with the name of their Idol <hi>Bel,</hi> as if he were
a professed Client of his, this little change of the
name declares himself to be inwardly a downright ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Idolatry, though always a
faithfull subject to the Kings of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as all good
men are to their Princes be they of what Religion
they will, though they never close with the palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
erours and gross mispractices therein. <hi>And the
thing was true,</hi> that is to say, the matter that was
communicated unto him was not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Chidah,</hi> a
prophetick Parable or Aenigm, (such as was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
hitherto unto him under the Types or
Figures of an Image of various Metalls, and of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
shaped Beasts, and therefore wanted an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation)
but it was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Emeth,</hi> a matter declared
plainly and apertly without any such Riddles or
figurative Involutions. <hi>But the time appointed
was long,</hi> that is, this clear and plain Prophecy or
Vision of <hi>the Scripture of Truth,</hi> without any Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmatical
shadows, (which begins at the next
Chapter and reaches to the end of <hi>Daniel)</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
a long extent of time, even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire to the end of the World
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59418:120"/>
or Conflagration, as is exprest in the Apocalypse.
<hi>And he understood the thing and had understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Uision,</hi> that is, he understood the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of truth,</hi> (for <hi>Vision</hi>
is here as much as <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as I noted above) it
wanting no Interpretation, as those Aenigmatical
Prophecies did. This further confirms that that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
[and the thing was true] is to be understood
as I have expounded it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the matter was
plainly delivered without any Aenigmatical Figure
or Symbols of Beasts or Statues as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Prophecies. Otherwise if [and the thing was
true] should be understood in that other sense as
opposed to <hi>False,</hi> it would imply that the foregoing
Visions were not true, than which nothing can be
more false or absurd.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In those days, <hi>i.e.</hi>
               </hi> On a certain time in that
Third year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia</hi> after the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the <hi>Iews</hi> (notwithstanding the gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

                  </gap>byses</hi> his
Son, his Father being busy in a foreign War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Scythians</hi> and others, as to hinder the
building of the Temple, as it is recorded in <hi>Ezra,</hi>
Ch. 4. <hi>That they hired Counsellers against them to
frustrate their purpose all the days of</hi> Cyrus <hi>King of</hi>
Persia. <hi>I Daniel was mourning thrée full Wéeks.</hi>
And the reason thereof I have already specified, the
Hebrew has it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Three <hi>Weeks of days,</hi>
in counter-distinction to the <hi>Seventy Weeks</hi> in the
foregoing Prophecy, which signify <hi>Weeks of years,</hi>
that when in any Prophecy it self of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Years
or Weeks or Days are mentioned, and nothing inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
to the contrary, it may be presently taken
for granted, that it is to be understood of <hi>Prophetical</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59418:121"/>
Years, Weeks and Days. Which being an observable
Rule in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the putting days for years can bring
no obscurity on the Prophecy, whereby it may less
deserve the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Emeth,</hi> a plain Prophecy.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>I ate no pleasant Bread, neither came Flesh
nor Wine in my Mouth, neither did I anoint my
self at all,</hi> which implies at other times he did all
these, especially he being in that quality in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that he was. But now in these Three Weeks
of Days he earnestly humbling himself before God in
the behalf of his Nation and Religion, he abstained
from all these things, (which otherwise it was lawfull
for him and accustomary to use) to recommend
himself the more to God, and make himself more
fit for Prayer, Contemplation and Devotion. <hi>Till
thrée whole Wéeks</hi> of Days <hi>were fulfilled.</hi> Though
there be no Propheticall Mystery in these days, they
being simply taken for days not for years, yet that
he would determine himself to <hi>Three Septenaries,</hi>
there may be some <hi>Cabbalisticall Arcanum</hi> therein,
though it may be more curious than needful. They
may signify a consummate subduing of the Flesh by
abstinence, for the fuller enjoyment of the Fruits of
the Spirit or Divine influence of the Holy Trinity
according to that of <hi>Prudentius</hi> the Christian Poet.

it as it touches upon the Prefecture or Province <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siana,</hi>
which <hi>Daniel</hi> was set over, and where he
was at the sight of this Vision. The head of it
is in <hi>Armenia major</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> says, and therefore
having come so long a way before it arrive at <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siana,</hi>
and being increased by several Rivers running
into it, it may well become great. It runs on the
West side of <hi>Vlai</hi> or <hi>Vlaeus</hi> which passes through
<hi>Susiana</hi> too, has its name as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports (Lib. 6.
c. 27.) by reason of the swiftness of its course, from
an <hi>Arrow, Ita appellant Medi Sagittam,</hi> as if <hi>Tigris</hi>
were from the Chaldee <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Tigris.</hi> And the Hebrew name <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Hiddekel</hi> is
given it for the same cause, from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>

               </gap> 
               <hi>levem ac velocem esse,</hi> which were a name as
proper at least for an <hi>Arrow</hi> as for the River <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris.</hi>
But this makes not much for the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Vision. See <hi>Gregor. Gregorii n.</hi> 191.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Then I lift up mine Eyes and looked and
behold a certain Man clothed in linen.</hi> This is
the very same Angel in humane shape that appeared
unto <hi>Daniel</hi> when he was near the River <hi>Vlai,</hi>
which <hi>Calvin</hi> not without Reason concluded to be
Christ, called there <hi>Palmoni.</hi> And therefore it will
be less rash to conclude this angelical shape to be
Christ here too, and consequently to be the same
Person in both places, which will be undoubtedly
true, if it appear that this Angel here is Christ, that
brought the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
gave them a Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> setled them in
the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and bestirs himself here in
their behalf in their Captivity at <hi>Babylon.</hi> Now I
think I have proved evidently enough in my <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Apocalypse,</hi> or rather it is plain at first
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59418:122"/>
sight, that the representation there of one like the
Son of Man, Ch. 1. amongst the golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
is the representation of Christ. And therefore
if that be the lively picture of this Angel described
in <hi>Daniel,</hi> we may well conclude that this Angel
here in <hi>Daniel</hi> is Christ. To take notice that here
in <hi>Daniel</hi> he is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a certain Man,</hi>
but in the Apocalypse one like to the <hi>Son of Man,
as a</hi> Picture is to him of whom it is the portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is one of the least observations.</p>
            <p>But it follows, <hi>Clothed in Linen,</hi> the Hebrew is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which in this place the Septuagint ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Ezek. Ch. 9. v.</hi> 2. they
render it <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. It is remarkable what
<hi>Grotius</hi> says upon this of <hi>Ezekiel, Idem habitus hîc

maximo,</hi> that is, to <hi>Aaron</hi> the type of Christ.
But from hence it is plain that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is the

And that therefore in both the Visions the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
in humane shape was clothed with the Pontifical
Garment down to the Foot, or both clothed with
Linen, which signifies the same thing, namely
such Linen or pure fine Silk as the High Priest
was clothed in. And as it is here said in <hi>Daniel,
Whose Loins were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

which is the same with <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. But these things

            <p>6. <hi>His Body also was like the Beryl.</hi> The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifies the <hi>Sea</hi> as well
as <hi>Beryllus Thalassius</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Now the
Sea signifying a multitude there is mention of this
<hi>Tharsis</hi> to signify the Party here described to be no
private Person but the Prince of a multitude, and
that the People is represented together with the
Prince. Which same thing is notified also in that
representation in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> though not by this
Symbol of <hi>Tharsis</hi> or the <hi>Beryl. <hi>And his Face as
the appearance of Lightning.</hi>
               </hi> For this, in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptick</hi>
representation is there put, <hi>His Head and
his Hairs were white as Wool as white as Snow,</hi> and
the whiteness of Snow has a very dazling brightness
in it like that of the Lightning, which is also a white
splendour not red like Fire, nor is the flashing moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it necessarily implied but only the bright co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
so that the <hi>Snow</hi> and it may signify the
same thing, a mature clearness and serenity of
mind. But now they agree again in the very words.
Here it is said, <hi>And his Eyes as lamps of fire,</hi>
and there, <hi>And his Eyes were as a flame of Fire:</hi> Here,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59418:123"/>
               <hi>And his Arms and his Féet like in colour to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
Brass;</hi> there, <hi>And his Feet like unto fine Brass
as if they burned in a Furnance.</hi> And lastly here it is
said, <hi>And the voice of his words like the voice
of a multitude;</hi> and there likewise, <hi>And his Voice
as the sound of many Waters;</hi> and Waters unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
are a Prophetical Symbol of a multitude.
Whence I say, Christ is described in both places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his Church, the <hi>Iewish</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the
<hi>Christian</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> And the Prophetick
Symbols signify much-what the same things in them
both. The greatest difference is, in that the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Beryl</hi> or <hi>Tharsis</hi> is left out, but it only
signifying a multitude, the multitude is expressly put
in, in the close of the Apocalyptick description, to
supply its place. And Brass brightened by <hi>Rubbing</hi>
or <hi>Polishing</hi> and <hi>Purified</hi> by the <hi>Fire</hi> will signify
the same things, the tryal of Affliction and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bettered by it. But it is not necessary to insist
over minutely on these things; it is evident enough
from what so easily offers it self, that this Angel is
that very <hi>Palmoni</hi> that appeared to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Ch. 8. 13.
as they both being the same Christ bestirring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the behalf of his Afflicted people the <hi>Iews,</hi> and
the latter having the same representation with that
of him in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> Ch. 1.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>And I Daniel alone saw the Uision, for
the men that were with me saw not the Uision,</hi>
At least they saw nothing but a Glorious light, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s fellow-travellers did, when Christ appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him going to <hi>Damascus,</hi> and yet they are
said to see no body, because they saw not the distinct
shape of the appearance, as here <hi>Daniel</hi> and it's like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there <hi>Saul</hi> did. But that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Companions
saw something, is evident from what follows. <hi>But a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59418:123"/>
a great quaking fell upon them so that they fled
to hide themse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ves.</hi> Which implies they saw some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
whereby they were thus terrified, and that
therefore this of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s was a real <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or
<hi>Day-Vision,</hi> and that he was in the place truly which
he mentions, namely by the great River, the River
<hi>Hiddekel</hi> or <hi>Tigris</hi> in <hi>Susiana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. <hi>Therefore I was left alone and saw this
great Uision.</hi> As being better fitted for such Divine
Communion by his Three Weeks preparation of
Fasting and Devotion. * But how an Angel can
make himself seen of one and yet not of others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
or whether the difference lie meerly in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposedness
of the persons that are to see, is a subtile
piece of Philosophy not requisite to enter upon in
this place. But well may this Vision be called great,
it being the sensible and distinct Presence of the
Lord Christ. <hi>And there remained no strength in
me,</hi> Being overcome and stounded at the Presence
of so Glorious a Personage, as it follows. <hi>For my
comeliness was turned in me into corruption,
and I retained no strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. <hi>Yet heard I the voice of his words.</hi> Though
he was half dead in this strange consternation of
mind, yet he heard the voice of this Illustious Angel
that was present with him. <hi>And when I heard the
voyce of his words,</hi> that is to say, But at the
hearing the Voice of his Words, <hi>Then was I in a
déep sléep on my Face, and my Face toward the
ground.</hi> The like passage is there Ch. 8. 18. and
therefore the like interpretation is to be given,
namely, that he was so overcome and astonished at
the Voice of this Angel as well as before at his sight,
that it made him fall down into a soporiferous
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59418:124"/>
swound with his face towards the Earth, his spirits
did so fail him or quite retire through fear.</p>
            <p>Thus were the natural or carnal powers abolished
in a manner and annihilated, turned into a present
Chaos and Death, before he could be raised up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a capacity to receive supernatural Illuminations.
And it is the Fate of those that have a strong robu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stious
carnal mind or wit, as they gladly would
have it called, to be as uncapable of understanding
these Prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> or any of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as he was before his humiliation and conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of Spirit, of receiving them. I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to bring in here that description of the Method
of Divine Wisdome, <hi>Siracid.</hi> Ch. 4. 17. <hi>At the first
she will walk with him by crooked ways, and bring
fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her
discipline, until she may trust his Soul and try him by
her Laws. Then will she return the streight way unto
him, and comfort him and shew him her Secrets.</hi> A
figure whereof we have here in this Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt <hi>Palmoni</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. <hi>And behold an Hand touched me.</hi> When he
was fallen thus to nothing in himself through per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
humiliation and contrition, then an hand from
without toucheth him, supernaturall power then
is conveyed unto him, by due degrees, not all at
once, nor <hi>per saltum,</hi> such inordinate motion having
no harmony in it, nor soundness or safety, neither
in things natural nor Divine. <hi>They goe from strength
to strength,</hi> saith the Psalmist, though their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
be but small as a mustard-seed. But we
must first learn to creep and then goe, according as
we may observe in the following words. <hi>Which
set me upon my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nées and upon the palms of my
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59418:124"/>
Hands.</hi> But this however was a good hopefull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
it being in vertue not of our own strength
but of that which is supernatural, which will carry
us out to the end if we be faithfull.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>And he said unto me, O Daniel a man
greatly beloved.</hi> I have noted above that the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
has it, <hi>A man of desires,</hi> and so may signify a
man of great love towards God and his people, or
a man greatly beloved of God and all good men.
<hi>Understand the words which I speak unto thée,
and stand upright.</hi> Thus was <hi>Daniel</hi> rouzed up and
enabled to hear, understand and to take perfect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of what was to be delivered unto him for the
information of Posterity. <hi>For unto thée am I now
sent,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> The word is the same from
whence <hi>Shilo</hi> the name of the <hi>Messias</hi> is derived.
Whence his being sent hinders nothing but that he
may be Christ, who is said in severall places to be
sent in the Gospel. <hi>And when he had spoken this
word unto me I stood trembling,</hi> i.e. by the vertue of
his saying unto me <hi>stand upright,</hi> I stood upon my
legs, but I trembled withall as yet being not so
throughly strengthened, or fearing what tidings
this Angel might bring unto me.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Then said he unto me, Fear not Daniel.</hi> This
was to encourage him and abate his trembling. <hi>For
from the first day,</hi> namely of the three Weeks of Days,
<hi>that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to
chasten thy self before thy God</hi> by fasting, mourning
and Prayer, <hi>Thy words were heard,</hi> Thy petition was
granted. <hi>And I am come for thy words,</hi> that is,
by reason of thy earnest and zealous prayer I am
come unto thee. Behold the admirable Efficacy of
earnest and sincere devotion that attracts to it, not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59418:125"/>
only the Ministry of Angels, but brings down into
converse the Son of God himself.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>But the Prince of the Kingdom of Persia
withstood me One and twenty Days.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> This is spoke
by way of preventing an objection; for if his Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was heard the very first day of the Three Weeks
of humiliation, <hi>Daniel</hi> might think strange that he
heard no news of it before now. But to solve that
difficulty the Angel tells him, that the Presidentiary
Angel of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia</hi> with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
detained him that time. And it is admirable
to take notice of the concurrence of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s prayers
and devotions, and the Activity of the <hi>Invisible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
for that which he prayed for. At the very same
time while he prayed, they acted for the effecting
the thing he prayed for. <hi>But lo Michael one of
the chief Princes came to help me.</hi> This bringing
in of <hi>Michael</hi> one of the chief Princes as assisting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Prince of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> shews
plainly that the Prince of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia</hi> is an
Angel as well as <hi>Michael,</hi> and therefore as <hi>Michael</hi> is
the Presidentiary Angel of the <hi>Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

the Prince of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia</hi> be the Presidentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Angel of the said Kingdom of <hi>Persia.</hi> From whence
it is plain that there are <hi>Presidentiary</hi> Angels of all
Kingdoms and Nations.</p>
            <p>To which purpose the ancient Fathers alledge
that of <hi>Deuter.</hi> Chap. 32. 8. according to the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagints</hi>
translation, as <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
<hi>When the most High divided to the Nations

he set the bounds of the People, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, understanding by the
<hi>Sons of God,</hi> the Angels. And with this agrees ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
well what follows in the Latine translation,
<hi>Pars autem Domini Populus ejus,</hi> but the Lord's
portion is the <hi>Iews, Iacob</hi> is the Lot of his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
This runs far more coherently than any sense
I can find Expositors make of it, who reade <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Which Text therefore implies that whereas
other Nations have but Presidentiary Angels over
them, the Lord himself, i.e. <hi>Iehova Filius, Palmoni,</hi> is
the Governour or King of <hi>Ieshurun</hi> or <hi>Israel,</hi> and
<hi>Michael</hi> the General of his Armies under him. But
now for the Presidentiary Angels of other Nations
* whether they be good Angels, as the general Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Fathers seems to confirm, or bad, as <hi>Gasper
Sanctius</hi> industriously endeavours to demonstrate, is
a point too nice to be insisted on in so brief an Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and therefore I will let it pass. <hi>And I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
there with the Kings of Persia.</hi> For I was left
alone (so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> will signify) as being the remainder
of those that were with me, i.e. <hi>Michael</hi> and I were
not both there together for a good while, I having
sent him elsewhere, but at last he came again to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
or relieve me; whom leaving behind me in my
place.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>Now I am come to make thee understand
what shall befall thy people,</hi> for whom thou didst so
earnestly intercede in thy devotions, <hi>In the latter
days. For yet the Uision is for many days.</hi> As it is
said verse 1. <hi>The thing was true, but the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
was long:</hi> as if he should say, Thy great zeal and
earnestness is concerning the deliverance of the <hi>Iews</hi>
out of this present Captivity, and to know what their
condition is like to be in reference to it. But I am,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59418:126"/>
for the good of my people, come to make thee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what will befall the <hi>Iews,</hi> or people of God at
large, through the series of many ages, even to the end
of all; what they shall suffer under the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire,
what under the <hi>Roman,</hi> and what an happy resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
there will be of them towards the end.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>And when he had spoken such words unto me,
I set my face towards the ground and became dumb,</hi>
that is, I lookt downwards towards the earth with
all reverence and modesty, not being able to bear
the glorious presence of this mighty Angel. And
my astonishment from having beheld him was so
great, and also from hearing his voice, that I was
not yet able to speak. For that Fear, and the surprize
of Admiration will stop the voice, is a thing vulgarly
known, and noted, both in Poets and Historians as
an effect of those passions.</p>
            <p>16. <hi>And behold one like the similitude of the sons
of men,</hi> not in a terrestrial body yet, though in
humane shape. It is the same Angel, says <hi>A Lapide,</hi>
which he had seen, and which had talked with him
all this time, and he will allow him to be a Type of
Christ, and <hi>Calvin</hi> mentions some that understand
this person in the similitude of the Sons of men, to
be Christ. <hi>Touched my lips,</hi> as he touched the
Tongue of the deaf and dumb man, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ephphata</hi> loosed his tongue, that he could speak,
as <hi>Daniel</hi> after the Angel had touched his Lips, says,
<hi>Then I opened my mouth and spake and said unto
him that stood before me, O my Lord by the Uisions
my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
no strength.</hi> So overcoming was the glorious
Presence of the Messiah, before he came in the flesh.
These consternations of mind in <hi>Daniel</hi> thus often
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59418:126"/>
repeated, set off the inexpressible eminency of the
person he conversed with, and the huge weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the matter that he was to conveigh unto
<hi>Daniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. <hi>For how can the servant of this my Lord,</hi>
The Hebrew may be rendred, How can this Servant
of my Lord! For <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Zeh</hi> here may be referred to
<hi>Servant,</hi> as well as <hi>Lord,</hi> and then the sense is, How
can so vile a servant, so wretched, poor and despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a creature as I am. For here <hi>Zeh</hi> signifies as <hi>Iste</hi>
in Latine, a diminishing indication. <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>k with this
my Lord,</hi> that is, with such an one as this my Lord
is. For here <hi>Zeh</hi> signifies eminency of Worth and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
or height of Glory and Majesty. Which
expressions of <hi>Daniel</hi> put <hi>Calvin</hi> to the trouble of
making an excuse for him, and to shew, that this
does <hi>nihil detrahere Dei Monarchiae.</hi> But understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
here by this Angel, that Christ is meant by it,
as I have proved he is meant thereby, this appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him by the name <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> conjoyned with so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
humiliation before him, can bear with it no
scruple or difficulty at all. <hi>For as for me, straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
there remained no strength in me.</hi> So perfect an
exinanition ought there to be of our own carnal
mind and powers for the fitting us to receive the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
power from God, and those divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
that flow from him. We ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
breathless and liveless as it were to our natural
and carnal sentiments and abilities, that we may be
inspired from above, and receive the Influences of the
holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>18. <hi>Then there came again and touched me, one
like the appearance of a man,</hi> that is, After <hi>Daniel</hi>
was thus lost and confounded in himself, and found
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59418:127"/>
no strength of his own carnal will and mind left
(that we may pursue the <hi>Moral</hi> Allegory also of this
Vision) and after the free and hearty acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the same, then Christ in humane shape here,
though not yet in humane flesh, touched him again.
<hi>And,</hi> says he, <hi>he strengthened me,</hi> namely by his
touch. So great virtue is there in the touch of the
Divine body of Christ.</p>
            <p>19. <hi>And said, O man, greatly beloved.</hi> What
senses [greatly beloved] may bear, I have more than
once intimated. <hi>Fear not,</hi> but instead of trusting in
thine own wit and strength, trust in me. It is the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
boast of St. <hi>Paul, I can do all things through Christ
that strengthens me.</hi> But that is more <hi>Moral,</hi> the
more <hi>Literal</hi> sense is intimated in what follows,
<hi>Peace be unto thee.</hi> Which friendly salutation shews,
that he came for the good of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and for the
good of his people the <hi>Iews,</hi> for whom he was so
much concerned. <hi>Be strong, yea, be strong.</hi> And
this is the word of him, of whom that is true, <hi>Dixit
&amp; factum est.</hi> For he is the Word by whose command
all things were created. The repeating therefore of
the command is a note of his proportionating sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
according to the sincere acknowledgment of our
defects and desire of being supplied from him. For it
is upon <hi>Daniel</hi> that <hi>man of desires,</hi> that these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
are bestowed. <hi>And when he had spoken
to me, I was strengthened.</hi> And by this strength
perceived and acknowldged to come from without,
not from our own natural and carnal principles, was
<hi>Daniel</hi> incouraged to think himself prepared to hear
the voice of Christ in things of greater concern, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it follows. <hi>And said, Let my Lord speak,
for thou hast strengthened me,</hi> that is, Thou hast
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59418:127"/>
enabled me to be a fit auditour of thy instructions
and informations.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>Then said he, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> the Angel, <hi>knowest thou
wherefore I come unto thée,</hi> that is, thou canst not
easily imagine what things and of what mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
I have to impart unto thee. <hi>And now will I
return to fight with the Prince of Persia, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> I
will return to dispute or contest (* for so <hi>Praeliari</hi>
is taken in <hi>Cicero)</hi> with the Presidentiary Angel of
<hi>Persia,</hi> after I have imparted what I have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
unto thee. <hi>And when I am gone forth,
lo, the Prince of Grecia shall come, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidentiary
Angel of <hi>Grecia,</hi> for he will also put in
for the Empire of the World, and to have the <hi>Iews</hi>
under his command. And this is the reason of the
mentioning of the Prince of <hi>Grecia</hi> here.</p>
            <p>21. <hi>But,</hi> now that I may enter upon what I came
to thee for, <hi>I will shew thée what is noted in the
Scripture of Truth,</hi> that is, I will declare in plain
words (without any Symbolical or Hieroglyphical
figures, such as were used in the former Prophecies)
the Divine Counsel and Purpose, so distinctly and
orderly as if it were writ in a <hi>Book,</hi> which Writing
therefore here is called <hi>Scripture,</hi> and for its plainness
and unsymbolicalness, as I may so speak, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the <hi>Scripture of Truth.</hi> And I do not question but
there is a certain correspondency betwixt this <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Truth,</hi> and that <hi>Book</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> first
<hi>Sealed</hi> and then <hi>Opened.</hi> The Prophecy of which
this <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> contains, and the times also
before the Epocha of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> from the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Monarchy to the said Epocha, which is fixt in
<hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign the Third of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
<hi>And there is none that holdeth with me in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59418:128"/>
these things but Michael your Prince,</hi> that is,
there is none of the Presidentiary Angels of the
Nations that holds fast to me but your Prince,
which is <hi>Michael</hi> the Presidentiary Angel of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> who is my General and therefore contains all
the Powers or Forces under him. So little occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is there, that Interpreters should be puzzled or
move difficulties how one Angel only should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in carrying on and assisting the affairs of
Gods People.</p>
            <p>But we may note here by the by, that as <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
here is made the Presidentiary Angel of Gods
people the <hi>Iews,</hi> so in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> he is made
the General to fight the Battles of the Christians,
the Christians succeeding into the place of the <hi>Iews</hi>
and being called or implied to be <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Israelites</hi>
in several places of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> And the sense
of this passage suits well with the interpretation of
the former passages that make this Angel so Great
and Glorious, and the same with <hi>Palmoni,</hi> as it is here
insinuated, that <hi>Michael</hi> is the <hi>Generaliss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>mo</hi> under
him, but that he himself is the <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so called and above this <hi>Generalissimo,</hi> that is,
that he is Christ.</p>
            <p>As is further confirmed out of the first Verse of
the following Chapter which ought to have been the
last of this, which contains the Proemial Vision to
the great Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth:</hi> which
first verse is this.<note place="margin">Chap. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Also I in the first year of Darius
the Mede, even I stood to confirm and strengthen
him.</hi> Where [I] is repeated and an Emphasis
put upon it, that that act should be imputed not
so much to the Minister <hi>Gabriel</hi> as to himself that
sent him, Ch. 9. 21. <hi>The man Gabriel whom I had
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59418:128"/>
seen in the Vision before,</hi> viz. Ch. 8. 16. <hi>being caused
to fly swiftly, touched me,</hi> &amp;c. Now in the Vision be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it is manifest that <hi>Palmoni</hi> commanded <hi>Gabriel,</hi>
saying, Gabriel <hi>make this man to understand the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Therefore there is all the reason to think that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi>
by the same <hi>Palmoni</hi> was caused to fly swiftly,
<hi>that is,</hi> was sent speedily to touch <hi>Daniel</hi> about the
time of the Evening Oblation, when he was at his
devotions in the first year of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede.</hi> But
in that it is said, he stood to confirm and strengthen
him, that is, to strengthen <hi>Michael,</hi> (as both <hi>Grotius</hi>
and other Expositours, as <hi>Calvin</hi> confesseth, refer
[Him] to <hi>Michael)</hi> by <hi>Michael,</hi> accordingly as is
perpetually to be observed in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> that by
Angels are understood the people over which they
preside, is to be meant the people of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who
with <hi>Daniel</hi> were strengthened and comforted by
that Prophecy, Ch. 9. delivered by <hi>Gabriel</hi> sent by
<hi>Palmoni</hi> unto him. Wherefore it is most evident also
from this last reason, that this Angel that delivers to
<hi>Daniel</hi> this Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> is the
same with <hi>Palmoni</hi> whom <hi>Calvin</hi> with judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
to be Christ. Whence therefore the Angel, that
delivers this book of the fate of the Church of God and
of Kingdoms in reference thereto, which is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> must also be
Christ.</p>
            <p>Which agrees admirably with that in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,</hi>
Ch. 5. That it was onely the Lion of the Tribe
of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that is, Christ that had the priviledg of
<hi>opening</hi> the <hi>Seven-sealed Book,</hi> and of looking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Which privilege of so wonderfull comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Prophecy he obtained upon the account of his
foreseen obedience even to the death of the Cross, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59418:129"/>
his actual undergoing thereof at the time appointed.
And again, that this privilege may be solely reserved
to him, that Angel also <hi>Apoc.</hi> Ch. 10. in my <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypsis
Apocalypseos,</hi> I have plainly shewn to be Christ,
who delivers the <hi>Little book</hi> to <hi>Iohn</hi> to swallow
down. Which haply amongst other reasons may be
called <hi>little</hi> in that, comparing the <hi>Epocha</hi> thereof
with this of the Prophecy of <hi>the Scripture of Truth,</hi>
(which begins with the Reign of <hi>Cambyses,</hi> but that
first in the Reign of <hi>Tiberius)</hi> it will be found to take
in less time than that by five or six hundred years.
But in this do they agree, both the Prophecy of the
<hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> and the Prophecy of the <hi>Sealed
Book</hi> and <hi>Opened Book,</hi> that these latter Prophecies
run through no other times than those of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> though they run not
through all of them, they beginning later by betwixt
five and six hundred years, but they both reach to
the end of all things or general Resurrection, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the same things of the same times, and are the
Prophecies of the same great Prophet even of Jesus
Christ the Son of God, as I have made manifest to
the taking away of all Cavils and derogation to our
Blessed Saviour, as if he put but in his sickle <hi>in mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sem
alienam, into another mans Harvest,</hi> and had
told by his Angel sent by him, <hi>Apoc.</hi> Ch. 1. nothing
but what another, one <hi>Daniel,</hi> of old had told before
him, saving that he was something more particular,
and more copious in declaring matters. Which though
it may be a pretty specious answer, and stand in stead,
where there is no better to be found, yet this I here inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
so absolutely stoppingmens mouths fromuttering
any such derogatory stuff against the person of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
I think is worthy of all due consideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59418:129"/>
it was as well Christ himself that delivered this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of the <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> to <hi>Daniel</hi> the man
<hi>greatly beloved,</hi> as it was Christ himself that sent his
Angel to <hi>Iohn,</hi> whose name also signifies <hi>gracious</hi> or
<hi>greatly beloved,</hi> to communicate to him the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the <hi>Sealed Book</hi> and the <hi>Opened Book</hi> and of
the <hi>Seven Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this might be understood by the careful
and intelligent Reader of this Proemial Vision, I
conceive all those passages that set off the exceeding
Grandeur and Majesty of this Angel, and the repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Consternations of mind and humble deportments
of <hi>Daniel</hi> towards him, are recorded, as the <hi>Literal</hi>
scope thereof. Which does not at all exclude those
<hi>Moral</hi> Insinuations I hinted in the Exposition of the
Vision.</p>
            <p>And thus much of this Vision Proemial to the
Vision or Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> which
<hi>Prooemium</hi> reaches to the very second verse of the
eleventh Chapter, as other Interpreters also have
taken notice how ill the division is made. The
eleventh Chapter should have begun at [And now
will I shew thee the Truth] and there will we
begin our Exposition of the <hi>Prophecy of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Truth.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Namely in the third year of the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Gasper Sanctius</hi> here moves a doubt how
well this of the first verse of this Chapter [In the
third year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia]</hi> agrees with vers.
21. of Chap. 1. <hi>And</hi> Daniel <hi>continued even unto the
first year of King</hi> Cyrus. Whence some Interpreters
collect, that <hi>Daniel</hi> either lived no longer, or at least
prophesied no longer than to the first year of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Monarchy. But here <hi>Sanctius</hi> out of St. <hi>Ierome</hi>
answers to his own scruple, That <hi>Daniel</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to have continued in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Court no
longer than to the first year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia.</hi>
But afterward though he returned not to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
with other Captives, yet he was translated from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
to the <hi>Medes,</hi> where he obtained an honourable
<hi>prefecture.</hi> And this is the account which Saint <hi>Ierome</hi>
with others give of the place, which sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
takes away the seeming repugnancy.</p>
               <p>Vers. 8. <hi>But how an Angel can make himself
seen of one,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Theodoret</hi> according, to <hi>Gasper San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctius,</hi>
is of opinion, that those that saw not, were
struck with a kind of blindness which the <hi>Greeks</hi>
call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were that could not
find the door, and those also that were sent from the
King of <hi>Syria</hi> to apprehend <hi>Elisha.</hi> But <hi>Cornelius</hi>
is point-blank against this opinion, and says expresly
that the cause why <hi>Daniel</hi> alone saw the Angel, and
not his companions, was not that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> wherewith
the Angel might strike them, as that Angel that stroke
the <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59418:130"/>
                  <hi>Sodomites, Gen.</hi> 19. 11. But that <hi>Angels</hi> in
assumed bodies as well as the <hi>Blessed</hi> in their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
bodies, have the <hi>species vis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>biles</hi> of their bodies in
their own power, and can transmit them to one,
suppose <hi>Daniel,</hi> and divert them from another. Which
opinion of <hi>A Lapide</hi> were yet more plausible if he
understood that Ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ls need not assume bodies, but
have bodies, <hi>Aethereal bodies,</hi> of their own, whose
raies therefore not <hi>Mechanically</hi> (as in burning glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which direct the beams of the Sun, otherwise
scarce sensible to the touch, so vigorously to one
point, that they will set on fire matter combustible)
but <hi>vitally</hi> they may direct toward one, party by the
command of their will and phancy, and slip by the
other. And though the difference of some seeing
and others not seeing at the same time the appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an Angel, may proceed from the Angel himself
that directs the visibility of his body, the visible raies
I mean thereof, to one party and not to another; yet
there may be a difference also in the parties themselves
present, whereby they may see some of them less di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
or not at all, others clearly and distinctly.
And this I conceive to proceed from the purity, mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and passivity of their Spirits. The Spirits of
whose eyes are far less thick, and less fiercely agitated
than others, these are more capable of seeing distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the subtle vehicles of Angels than others are. And
therefore men of a more fierce, strong, robustious
temper, are more inept to see any such <hi>Spectra,</hi> as it
is observed of them. And as for madmen, whose
Spirits are gross and hugely agitated, I conceive
they do not so much see <hi>Spectres</hi> as raise them in
themselves, by the strength and fieriness of their
Imagination. So that what they see is more
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59418:131"/>properly to be called a <hi>Phantasm</hi> than a <hi>Spectre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vers. 13. <hi>Whether they be good Angels,</hi> &amp;c.] This
controversy <hi>Gasper Sanctius</hi> pursues pretty copiously,
and of himself is very much inclining to conclude
against the authority of the antient Fathers, that the
Presidentiary Angels of the Nations, of all but that
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> were downright Devils. The two chief
arguments are, First, That the Devil is said to be the
Prince of this world, <hi>Iohn 12. 31. Now shall the
Prince of this world be cast out.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul, Ephes.
6. 11. For we wrestle not,</hi> saith he, <hi>against flesh
and bloud,</hi> that is against Men onely, <hi>but against
Principalities, against Powers, against the Rulers of
the darkness of this world</hi> (of this world of darkness
(an usual Hypallage) this world comprised within
the caliginous Air) <hi>against spiritual wickednesses</hi>
(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, so it is to be read ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Syriack</hi> version, <hi>cum spiritibus malis,</hi>
against wicked spirits) <hi>in high places,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
the same version has it, <hi>qui sunt sub coelo,</hi> viz. in
the Air, for so <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> often signifies out of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.</hi>
Which passage of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> suits excellently
well with this Hypothesis of Presidentiary Angels in
<hi>Daniel.</hi> But whether all Angels that are Presidents
of the Nations besides such as belong to the Church
of God be downright Devils, is the controversy.
And these two Scriptures are the first argument for
the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> That since the Devil is said to be
the Prince of this World in distinction to the Church
of God, and that in bringing the world into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to Christ, the Apostles fought against evil
Spirits that had the Rule of this dark World, that
were the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Chieftains, Presidents,
and Emperours of it, that it is hence apparent, that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59418:131"/>the Presidentiary Angels, suppose, of <hi>Persia</hi> and
<hi>Greece</hi> were Devils.</p>
               <p>The second argument is from the contest of the
Presidentiary Angels of <hi>Grecia</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi>
and <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and indeed with <hi>Palmoni</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which is the other argument which <hi>Sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi>
brings and pursues with that tightness in answering
all the evasions of the adverse party, that I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I do not wonder that he is so much inclining
to this opinion of his, That these Presidentiary An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> were <hi>Cacodaemones,</hi> as he
calls them, downright Devils, rather than good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
Though it is hard on the other side to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that mere <hi>Quintessential</hi> Devils, such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
onely of envy, pride and malice, and pursue evil
for evils sake, should be Presidents over Nations.
Wherefore in respect of such Devils as these, we may
with the Ancient Fathers conclude them to be good
Angels, but in respect of that more holy and divine
grace, such as Christ was anointed with in a measure
far above his fellows, but such as by his means all of
his Kingdome properly so called, in some measure
partake of, and are expresly, and from the root
of their life the Sons of Light and Love, we may,
I say, comparing those Presidentiary Angels of <hi>Greece</hi>
and <hi>Persia</hi> with these of Christs Kingdom, conclude
them not to be good Angels but Devils.</p>
               <p>If any one will adventure to say, That there is
some such Analogy betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> the Presidentiary
Angel of <hi>Iudea</hi> and the Presidentiary Angel of <hi>Greece</hi>
or <hi>Persia,</hi> as there is betwixt the most holy and
most regenerate Christian King or Emperour, and
some other Emperour or King that is neither styled
Christian nor is regenerate, haply he may not be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59418:132"/>much out of the way. But I leave to every one
to think of such things as these, in such a way as
will be with most ease and satisfaction to himself,
provided he shrink not from the belief of that
which is so manifest here on <hi>Daniel, viz.</hi> that
there are <hi>Presidentiary Angels</hi> over Nations and
Countreys.</p>

Empire, not resembling the first to a Bear or Ram,
the second to a Leopard or Goat, and the third to
a monstrous Beast with Iron teeth, but delivering
the matter without any Prophetick Aenigm or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
you shall hear from me the bare Truth in easy
and vulgar words. <hi>Behold there shall stand up yet
three Kings in Persia,</hi> viz. <hi>Cambyses, Smerdis</hi> and
<hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> which that particle [yet] seems
to imply, as if it should hint to us, that they are three
beside <hi>Cyrus</hi> the then present King of <hi>Persia,</hi> so that
<hi>Cyrus</hi> is not to be taken into this reckoning. <hi>And
the fourth shall be far richer than they all.</hi> Which
fourth is <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the same who is called <hi>Ahasuerus</hi>
(in the book of <hi>Esther)</hi> who married <hi>Esther</hi> the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Virgin; and <hi>Herodotus</hi> records the name of
<hi>Xerxes</hi> his Queen to have been <hi>Amestris,</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
has the sound of <hi>Esther</hi> in it, whatever the
syllable <hi>Am</hi> prefixed may signify, whether it be from
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifies <hi>Sol,</hi> her beauty being such an
Inflammatory to love, or from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>mater.</hi> For such
in a wonderfull manner was she to her Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
the <hi>Iews,</hi> whose lives she saved from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of <hi>Haman,</hi> which was no less to them than
their mothers did for them that first gave them their
lives. But if we are to read as <hi>Ioseph Scaliger</hi>
would have it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and that there is the like
composition of the name of the Father of <hi>Aman,
viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this is not so consistent with our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
conjectures: but what <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the composition
of those two names signifies, neither <hi>Scaliger</hi> nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one else I know, can tell us. However so be
that <hi>Esther</hi> be but acknowledged to sound in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris
Xerxes</hi> his Queen, I am content.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:59418:133"/>
Now for the riches of this <hi>Xerxes</hi> or <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi>
all Histories ring of it, and the Book of <hi>Esther</hi> will
assure us thereof, which says he reigned from <hi>India</hi>
even to <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> over an hundred and seven and
twenty Provinces. And <hi>Iustin</hi> Lib. 2. notes of the
riches of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> that though his Army was so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
that they drunk up rivers, yet his riches were
so great that the expence of so vast an Army nor any
other occasions could exhaust them. So hugely is
it verified of this fourth King, that he was far richer
than they all, and that therefore there is no doubt
but that it is <hi>Xerxes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which yet is further confirmed from what follows,
<hi>And by his strength through his riches he shall stir
up all against the Realm of Grecia.</hi> The expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Xerxes</hi> against the <hi>Greeks</hi> is so vulgarly
known and copiously set down in <hi>Iustin, Diodorus,
Siculus</hi> and <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that to remind the Reader
of it is sufficient. And that he did stir up <hi>all</hi> against
the Realm of <hi>Grecia,</hi> is I think very plain if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the numerousness of his Army as it is described
in <hi>Herodotus</hi> Lib. 7. Cap. 186. where he reckons up
no less than twenty six hundred thousand and forty
one thousand six hundred and ten <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>fighting men,</hi> to which he adds <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the <hi>Attendants of the Army,</hi> that
were to minister to them, and others that came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them. All which put together, says he,
made a number at least as big as that of the <hi>fighting
men.</hi> So that there was in all at least two and fifty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand and eighty three thousand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty. And this, says he, is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
which he brought as far as to the <hi>Thermopylae.</hi> But
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59418:133"/>
for the number of the women to dress their meat,
and of Courtizans, and Eunuchs, of Wagon-horses,
and other beasts of burthen, and of <hi>Indian</hi> Dogs, it
was not to be told they were so many. Whence
says he, I less wonder that it is reported that some
Rivers were drunk up by them; which also <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
relates, and likewise the number of his Ships,
that they were about one thousand two hundred.
So that <hi>Xerxes</hi> by this account may well be said
to have stirred up <hi>all</hi> against the Realm of <hi>Grecia.</hi>
And he must needs be rich that could set out such
a Fleet and maintain such an Armie, as I noted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.
Thus notably is this Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
concerning this fourth King of <hi>Persia.</hi> Who
came against the Realm of <hi>Grecia</hi> with an Army to
quite overflow them and swallow them up at once.
Of which <hi>Xerxes</hi> confiding in the numerousness of
his Army, made himself sure in a manner, as we
may understand by that discourse betwixt him and
<hi>Demaratus</hi> that had been King of <hi>Sparta.</hi> See <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodot.</hi>
Lib. 7. Cap. 101, 102, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
produced enough to shew how fully the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is accomplished.</p>
            <p>But why there are no more than four of the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Kings mentioned in this Prophecy, and why four,
I conceive the reason is because the scope of this
Prophecy is mainly to forewarn the People of God
of the evils that would come upon them, or what
mutations there would be in which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
whether <hi>Iews</hi> or Christians, and therefore the
catalogue of the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> is so short, but yet
brought down to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who would have swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up all <hi>Greece,</hi> as a fit transition to the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Alexander</hi> against the <hi>Persians,</hi> which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59418:134"/>
the reasonableness of the success which was
given him by Providence as follows.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>And a mighty King shall stand up,</hi> namely
<hi>Alexander</hi> the great, <hi>That shall rule with great
dominion and do according to his will,</hi> that is,
All things shall succeed according to his mind. And
it is <hi>Curtius</hi> his character of him, Lib. 10. <hi>Fatendum
est tamen cùm plurimum virtuti debuerit, plus debu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse
Fortunae, quam solus omnium mortalium in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate
habuit.</hi> He had the world in a string, as our
English Proverbial Phrase is. So fitly is this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
fulfilled in <hi>Alexander.</hi> But we will only take
notice by the by, how like this is, which is a
Transition from the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire to the <hi>Grecian,</hi>
how like it is, I say, to that Transition from the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
to the <hi>Roman,</hi> Vers. 36. <hi>And a King shall do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will.</hi> In both which the transition is
so little pompous and discriminative, that if the
matter it self did not discover there was a Transiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from one Empire to another, the Form of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
would scarcely assure us of it. But being no
man doubts but that here is a Transition (though
the form be so slender and obscure) from the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, so the slenderness and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scureness
of the Form of the Transition (v. 36.) from
the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire to the <hi>Roman,</hi> ought to be no
prejudice to the reality thereof.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>And when he shall stand up his Kingdom shall
be broken and shall be divided toward the four winds of
Heaven,</hi> namely, into four Kingdoms lying North,
West, East and South. Which are the Kingdoms of
<hi>Thracia, Macedonia, Asia</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Lysimachus, Cassander, Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Ptolemae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
See what has been said above Ch. 8. <hi>And not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59418:134"/>
to his posterity.</hi> For within sixteen years space af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s death, not only <hi>Aridaeus</hi> the brother
of <hi>Alexander</hi> together with his mother <hi>Olympias</hi>
were put to death, but also <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son of
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great and <hi>Roxana,</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> the
other Son of <hi>Alexander</hi> by <hi>Barsine</hi> was killed, and
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> the sister of <hi>Alexander.</hi> So fully is this
passage accomplished [And not to his Posterity.]
<hi>Nor according to his dominion which he ruled.</hi> As
not having that strenuity and greatness of parts, nor
that strength; his entire Empire being thus divided
into four Kingdoms, which therefore was a weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, and made it subject to dissen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

themselves, besides that there were several other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapies
which other commanders of <hi>Alexander</hi> were
possest of, distinct from those four Kingdoms, which
was a further weakening thereof; as it follows. <hi>For
his Kingdom shall be plucked up even for others
besides those.</hi> The Hebrew word which our English

Menander, Leonatus, Seleucus</hi> and others had
their portions distinct from those four, whereby the
main body of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Kingdom possest by them,
was the more weakened.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>And the King of the South shall be strong,</hi>
that is, <hi>Ptolemaeus</hi> the Son of <hi>Lagus</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:59418:135"/>
He speaks onely of the Kings of the <hi>South,</hi> and of the
<hi>North,</hi> that is, of the Kings of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and of <hi>Syria,</hi>
because the affairs of the <hi>Iews</hi> are most concerned in
them. And this very first King of <hi>Aegypt, Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus</hi>
the Son of <hi>Lagus,</hi> he is taken notice of in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
for that treacherous exploit of his, of the
taking <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on the Sabbath day, under pretence
of Sacrificing. But he possest himself of the City
they not arming themselves for resistance. For which
<hi>Agatharchides Cnidius</hi> twitts them, as a fond people
that preferred their superstition before their liberty.
He carried many of the <hi>Iews</hi> at that time with him
into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> See <hi>Ioseph.</hi> Antiq. lib. 12. c. 1. <hi>And one of
his Princes,</hi> that is, one of the Princes of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
says <hi>Grotius;</hi> but if it be referred not to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
but to <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> it may haply be one of those
lesser Princes that he had a more special favour for:
but either way it is <hi>Seleucus Nicator,</hi> that is here
meant, who got up first toward this greatness by the
favour and countenance of this <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> as I noted
above. <hi>And he shall be strong above him. <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
               </hi>
shall outdoe <hi>Ptolemy</hi> in exploits of war. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Son of <hi>Antigonus</hi> he added
<hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>Syria,</hi> he overcame <hi>Lysimachus</hi> King of <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
in batle, and <hi>Antigonus</hi> in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> as <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotus</hi>
also in <hi>India,</hi> from which great exploits he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
to himself the name of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> or <hi>Nicator,</hi>
as if we should say, <hi>Seleucus</hi> the Conquerour. <hi>And have
Dominion,</hi> That is plain from which has been said
already. <hi>His Dominion shall be a great Dominion.</hi>
And so it appears to have been by History, as <hi>Grotius</hi>
has noted out of <hi>Appianus,</hi> according to whom his
Dominion contained all these Countreys, <hi>Syria,
Phrygia, Mesopotamia, Bactriana, Arabia, Sogdiana,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59418:135"/>
Arachosia</hi> and a great part of <hi>India,</hi> even beyond the
River <hi>Indus.</hi> And <hi>Appianus</hi> adds in general, that he was
by far the most potent of all the successours of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and that there were built by him near fifty Cities.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>And in the end of years,</hi> that is, After a certain
time, <hi>They shall ioyn themselves together,</hi> that is,
They shall be friends or confederates one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>viz.</hi> the King of the <hi>North,</hi> with the King of
the <hi>South.</hi> Not that the same Individual persons
<hi>Ptolemaeus Lagi</hi> and <hi>Seleucus Nicanor</hi> shall do this,
but some of the succession of each of them. For the
succession of the Kings of the <hi>North</hi> and of the <hi>South,</hi>
or of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> are in the Prophetick style
spoke of, as of two single Kings continuing all that
time of their Kingdomes. Which is a thing so
obvious and known, that it hinders not at all, but
that this Prophecy may be called the Prophecy of the
<hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> for all that. <hi>For the Kings
Daughter of the South shall come to the King of
the North to make an agréement.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi>

prevailed so far that he took <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and the
upper parts beyond <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and almost all <hi>Asia,</hi> and
when he heard there was sedition moved at home in
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> he spoiling the Kingdoms of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> brought
away with him fourty thousand Talents of silver, and
two thousand five hundred Images of their Gods, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which were those that <hi>Cambyses</hi> when he
took <hi>Aegypt</hi> carried away with him into <hi>Persia.</hi> For
which feat of bringing back again their Images that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59418:137"/>
were violently taken from them so many years agoe,
the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> being a very superstitious people, he
obtained the name of <hi>Euergetes</hi> amongst them, as
if he had been so great a benefactour to them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
their Images. Thus St. <hi>Ierome</hi> out of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which he had the use of, but since have perished.
<hi>And he shall continue more years than the King of
the North. <hi>Ptolemaeus Euergetes</hi>
               </hi> his Reign was six
years longer than the Reign of <hi>Seleucus Callinicus</hi> the
Son of <hi>Antiochus Theos</hi> by <hi>Leodice;</hi> his Reign was
almost by one third part longer than his. And the
Kingdom of <hi>Syria</hi> was made a Province by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
betwixt thirty and fourty years before <hi>Aegypt</hi>
was, if that may be also insinuated. But the former
is more material, it implying that <hi>Callinicus</hi> durst
not bouge against <hi>Aegypt</hi> all the days of his life, <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaeus
Euergetes</hi> who got so full a victory over him
(which would naturally daunt his spirits) being still
living.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>So the King of the South, <hi>Ptolemaeus Euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets,</hi>
shall come into his Kingdom and shall return
into his own land.</hi> Which intimates his power and
success to have been so great and with so little loss
to his Armie, and with that ease, as if he had been
Lord of <hi>Syria,</hi> and had free ingress and egress at
his pleasure.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>But his Sons shall be stirred up.</hi> Though
that shamefull overthrow he had received, cowed
the Spirit of <hi>Seleucus Callinicus,</hi> yet his two sons
<hi>Seleucus Ceraunus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus Magnus</hi> after his death,
and indeed after the death of <hi>Ptolemaeus Euergetes,</hi>
which was a further incouragement to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirred
themselves to recover what their father had
lost, and to that end gathered a great Armie as it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59418:137"/>
follows. <hi>And shall assemble a multitude of great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
See <hi>Polyb.</hi> lib. 2. and lib. 5. And they were the
more encouraged thereto, <hi>Ptolemaeus Euergetes</hi> not
onely being dead, but a person little beloved, a killer
of his father, mother and brother, and therefore in
derision called <hi>Philopator,</hi> succeeding him. <hi>And he
shall certainly come and overflow and pass through.</hi>
Though he began with the two sons, yet he changes
the number plural here into the singular, because <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus
Ceraunus</hi> died in the beginning of the enterprise,
reigning scarce three years. Wherefore <hi>Antiochus
Magnus</hi> is here meant by him that shall certainly
come and overflow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For he did overflow <hi>Iudea</hi> and
<hi>Coele Syria</hi> by the treachery of <hi>Theodotus Ptolemaeus
Philopator</hi> his Governour of that Province. <hi>Then shall,
he return and be stirred up even to his fortress.</hi> And
after this no peace being concluded, he shall again
renew the war, and taking many Towns he shall at
last come to <hi>Raphia</hi> an exceeding well fortified Town
in the confines of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> See <hi>Polybius,</hi> lib. 5.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>And the King of the South shall be moved
with choler and shall come forth and fight with him,
even with the King of the North,</hi> viz. <hi>Philopator</hi>
with <hi>Antiochus Magnus.</hi> For though <hi>Philopator</hi> was
but a sluggish voluptuous person, and given to his
ease and pleasure, yet when his proper Kingdom was
in such imminent danger, he was inraged, and thought
it was time to bestir himself for fear he should not
only lose <hi>Syria</hi> but <hi>Aegypt</hi> too. <hi>And he shall set
forth a great multitude.</hi> Seventy thousand Foot and
five thousand Horse, and seventy three Elephants.
<hi>And a multitude shall be given into his hand,</hi> that is,
He shall take many prisoners of the Armie of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
Magnus.</hi> Which is the thing that the Author of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59418:138"/>
the third Book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> expresly sets down, and
that the success was from the passionate importunity
of <hi>Arsinoe Philopators</hi> sister, who ran up and down
from one part of the Armie to the other with her hair
disheveled and hanging about her shoulders, and by
promises and earnest intreatings driving the soldiery
to fight with more than ordinary resolution and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
whereby they won the day, and took many
Prisoners. <hi>Grotius</hi> out of <hi>Polybius</hi> names four thousand,
and the rest were killed or routed and put to flight.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>And when he hath taken away the multitude,</hi>
that is, When he hath partly taken captive, partly
killed, and so taken them out of the way, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put to flight and scattered the multitude of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
his Armie, and thereby driven them away from
his Territories. <hi>His heart shall be listed up,</hi> His
heart that was oppressed and depressed with fear and
anxiety before, will be now more lightsome and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and give it self the swing to satisfie its own lusts,
in this security, by his unclean conversation with
<hi>Agathoclea</hi> the singing wench and <hi>Agathocles</hi> her
brother, and will rudely and prophanely at <hi>Iudea</hi> not
onely come into the <hi>Temple,</hi> but rush into the <hi>Holy</hi>
of <hi>Holies</hi> against the advice and persuasion of all
either pious or prudent By-standers. See the third
Book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> Ch. 1. <hi>And he shall cast down ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ten thousands, but he shall not be strengthned by
it.</hi> The sense is (for of this latitude is the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the particle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

agree) <hi>Yet shall he not be strengthened by it.</hi>
Though that great Armie of <hi>Antiochus Magnus</hi> was
quite vanquished by him, yet <hi>Antiochus</hi> himself esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59418:138"/>
he will appear again in the field and undoe all
that hath been done, after he has espied an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
for his purpose. The Idleness, Luxury and
Sottishness of <hi>Philopator</hi> made this great advantage
he had got against <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to signify nothing.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>For the King of the North shall return and
shall set forth a multitude greater than the former.</hi>
He shall again gather an Army and that greater than
the former. <hi>And shall certainly come after certain
years,</hi> that is, These things were a brewing for a
certain time while he observed the luxury and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteness
of <hi>Philopator</hi> and his mindlesness of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
which encouraged him to meditate this other
War against <hi>Egypt,</hi> made him sure to come, and gave
him hope of Success. <hi>With a great Army and much
riches,</hi> With a great Army and well appointed. Which
Armies sometimes are not, by reason of the want of
money or whatever necessaries are requisite for the
good appointment of an Army. For the Hebrew
word <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>14. <hi>And in those times there shall many stand up

Magnus</hi> having made a firm league with <hi>Philip</hi> of
<hi>Macedonia,</hi> he was assisted by him upon condition
of dividing the spoils equally upon victory; and
hence, saith St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> is to be understood the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>many standing up against the King of the
South,</hi> that is, the King of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Which attempt
was made in <hi>Ptolemaeus Epiphanes</hi> his time, the
Son of <hi>Philopator,</hi> of not passing four or five years
of age, and the stress of affairs lay then upon that
impure and dissolute Minister of State <hi>Agathocles.</hi>
But the wisest act that <hi>Philopator</hi> did before his
death, was his recommending his young Child to
the tutelage and protection of the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as you may gather out of <hi>Iustin</hi> Lib. 31. <hi>Also the

and therefore the sense may be, Those of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which are Breakers of the Law or of the Union
of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church and Nation, some siding with
the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> others with the King of <hi>Syria,</hi>
they shall be puffed up, (namely those of the King

Ptolemaeus Lagi,</hi> as you heard above, so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Wshich were accomplished in the Victory of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
against <hi>Scopas, Ptolemaeus Epiphanes</hi> his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and them whom <hi>Antiochus</hi> overthrew at the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
of the River <hi>Iordan;</hi> And when he had taken the
Towns of <hi>Coele Syria</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> that <hi>Scopas</hi> was
possessed of, the <hi>Iews</hi> delivered up <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to him
of their own accord, and helpt to beat <hi>Scopas</hi> his
Garison-Souldiers out of the Tower he there had
left them in, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us, Lib. 12. c. 3.</p>
            <p>And now though this may be part of the sense of
these words [to establish the Vision] and most accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
to that very time; yet considering there was
a continuation of these <hi>Partizim</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> even to
<hi>Onias</hi> the junior his time, and onward, I think there
may be a glance also at a further completion of this
passage in <hi>Onias,</hi> who in the time of <hi>Ptolemaeus Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lometor</hi>
fled into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and being favourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
there of <hi>Ptolemee</hi> obtained leave to build
a Temple in the Nomus or Canton of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi>
and drew a great many of the <hi>Iews</hi> to him, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to fulfill the Vision of <hi>Isaias</hi> Ch. 19. vers. 19.
<hi>There shall be an Altar of the Lord in the midst of the
Land of Aegypt.</hi> Which Temple after it had stood 250
years, was in the time of <hi>Vespasian</hi> rased to the very
ground. And though it stood so long, yet St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
and other Interpreters think this feat of <hi>Onias</hi>
here pointed at. But I leave it to the Readers judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to consider it. <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretation
touching the deserters of the Law at that time
may be the first Impletion of the Prophecy, but
this may be more particularly and eminently inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the fall of this Temple and the <hi>Iews</hi> at once.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59418:140"/>
15. <hi>So the King of the North shall come.</hi> For
the King of the North, <hi>Antiochus Magnus,</hi> shall come,
whereby these contemners of the Law shall smart for
it. For this <hi>Antiochus</hi> was a great friend to the <hi>Iews</hi>
that stuck to <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, and were no Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catours,
but did things according to his prescript, as
you may see in <hi>Iosephus</hi> in the place abovenamed.
<hi>And cast up a Mount.</hi> Against <hi>Sidon</hi> (saith St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
who had the benefit of more Historians than are
extant at this day) where he shut up <hi>Scopas, Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus
Epiphanes</hi> his General, so close and so long, that
he forced him to yield. <hi>And take the most fenced
Cities,</hi> according as I have noted above out of <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus.
And the arms of the South shall not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,</hi>
viz. <hi>Europus, Menocles</hi> and <hi>Damaxenus,</hi> whom
<hi>Ptolemy</hi> sent to relieve <hi>Scopas</hi> when he was shut up,
but in vain. <hi>Neither his chosen people,</hi> namely those
supplies that came with those three Commanders.
<hi>Neither shall there be any strength to withstand.</hi> All
attempts will be in vain.</p>
            <p>16. <hi>But he that cometh against him,</hi> against the
forces of <hi>Ptolemaeus Epiphanes, <hi>Shall do according
to his own will,</hi>
               </hi> Shall have compleat success, <hi>And
none shall stand before him,</hi> And the <hi>Iews</hi> shall of their
own accord deliver up the city to him, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.
And he shall stand in the glorious land, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> in
<hi>Iudea.</hi> The <hi>Septuagint</hi> do not venture to render the

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but retain the word, as if we should say,
<hi>And he shall stand in the land of</hi> Sabi. Which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I suspect to be the name of the God of that Land,
namely of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> who is called the Lord
of Hosts. Of his entring <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> upon
his vanquishing of <hi>Scopas</hi> I have hinted enough above.
<hi>Which by his hand shall be consumed.</hi> The vulgar
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59418:140"/>
Latin has it so likewise. But the Interpretation suits
not with History. For as I intimated above, <hi>Antiochus
Magnus</hi> was very kind to the <hi>Iews</hi> (as you may see
at large in a letter of his inserted by <hi>Iosephus</hi> into his
<hi>Antiquities,</hi> lib. 12. c. 3.) granted them many Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
supplied their expenses for sacrifices and repairs
of the Temple, with other Testimonies of his favour
to them. Wherefore the true Interpretation of the
place is, <hi>Which shall be perfected by his hand,</hi> that is,
which shall flourish under his Power. For the word
in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

strength of his whole Kingdom.</hi> The more genuin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
sense I conceive is, and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> easily admits it,
<hi>viz.</hi> [He shall also set his face to get into the power
of his, namely of <hi>Ptolemaeus Epiphanes</hi> his, whole
Kingdom] that is to say, He was not content with
the regaining onely <hi>Coele Syria</hi> and <hi>Iudea</hi> which
were his Ancestours before, but he has a design to
make himself Master also of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> there being such
a fair opportunity by reason of the youngness of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy,</hi>
and the present disorder of things there. <hi>And
upright ones with him.</hi> And there are upright ones
with him. But the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which I
conceive may very well be the same with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
vers. 6. which signified <hi>Agreements.</hi> And so <hi>Gasper
Sanctius</hi> also expounds it. But if it be not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
as before of a <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Agreement</hi> but of
<hi>men,</hi> then the sense will be, That <hi>Antiochus</hi> will bring
along with him honest, fair conditioned men, and
such as had a good repute withall, to help to carry
on the match betwixt his daughter <hi>Cassandra</hi> and <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaeus

               </gap>, <hi>And he shall do,</hi> that is, It shall succeed.
<hi>And he shall give him the Daughter of women,</hi> that
is, He shall give him his daughter <hi>Cassandra</hi> * the
fairest of women, and <hi>Coele Syria, Phaenice, Iudea</hi>
and <hi>Samaria</hi> for a dowry with her, <hi>Corrupting her,</hi>
that is, infusing such principles into her, if she would
listen to him, as might make her instrumental by
treachery to her husband to get her father <hi>Antiochus</hi>
the Kingdom of <hi>Aegypt. <hi>But she shall not stand on
his side,</hi>
               </hi> or, She shall not persist in such ways as her
father would put her in. <hi>Neither be for him,</hi> She
will make good her duty to her husband, and be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to him and loyal as to her husband and Prince,
and not be seduced by her father. So that <hi>Antiochus</hi>
his Politicks fell short of success in this design of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
his daughter to <hi>Ptolemaeus Epiphanes,</hi> though
it was wisely enough done upon other regards, to
shew himself by this match to be a friend to whom
the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate was a friend, and also to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
his Interest by this alliance against the <hi>Romans</hi>
if they proved his enemies. But the Text is plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
already.</p>
            <p>18. <hi>After this shall he turn his face unto the Isles.</hi>
Which he thought he might do with the better secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
having laid so firm a foundation of friendship
with the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that worser plot which he
was conscious of, being kept to himself, and <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi>'s
piety to her father, though she was loyal to her
husband, permitting her to discover nothing. By
the <hi>Isles</hi> are understood any maritime Towns as well
as Islands properly so called in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Idiom.
And he is recorded to have set himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

even several Islands properly so called, as <hi>Rhodus,

his setting his face toward the Isles, and how
he came to be engaged in that war. <hi>But a Prince
for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by
him to cease, without his own reproach he shall
cause it to return upon him.</hi> This translation is
something obscure and confused, <hi>Grotius</hi> has rendred
it out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> into <hi>Latin</hi> very truly and clever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus. <hi>Et cessare faciet Dux ipsius in se contumelias,
quinetiam contumelias illius in ipsum vertet,</hi> that is, A
Commander shall cause to cease his (that is <hi>Antiochus</hi>
his) reproach against him, yea, and moreover he shall
return the reproach upon himself, <hi>viz.</hi> upon <hi>Antiochus.</hi>

this of <hi>Lucius Scipio</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Commander,
who brought it to pass that <hi>Antiochus</hi> should not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no longer despise and slight the offers of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Senate, and infest their confederates with war,
which they took as a great affront, but that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
at last should fall foully upon himself, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wholly vanquished by <hi>Lucius Scipio</hi> at <hi>Sipylus</hi>
a Mountain in <hi>Asia Minor</hi> near the confines of <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
where fifty thousand of his men were slain and
eleven thousand taken prisoners as <hi>Iustin</hi> writes, and
<hi>Antiochus</hi> brought to hard and dishonourable terms
of peace, whereby he was bound to have nothing
more to do with any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> nay that the
<hi>Romans</hi> should have <hi>Asia,</hi> and he rest content with
the Kingdom of <hi>Syria,</hi> that he should surrender all
his ships and captives, and also defray the expences
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59418:142"/>
of the war. See <hi>Iustin</hi> lib. 31. He gave hostages also
for performance of Covenant, namely his two Sons,
<hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> Thus was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
cast upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Power by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with usury upon himself at last.</p>
            <p>19. <hi>Then shall he turn his face toward the

of his own Kingdom. Upon this passage <hi>Cornelius</hi>
briefly thus, out of St. <hi>Ierome. Antiochus</hi> vanquished
by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and commanded to bound his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
within the Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> went thence to
<hi>Apamia, Susa</hi> and other of the more remote parts of

               </hi> For his luxury put him upon the greater exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
as <hi>Calvin</hi> observes, and we may be sure he
would not spare the people, who did not stick to rob
the Temple of the money there deposited for pious

riches are the Political glory and decor of any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

Of which Taxes, besides his own luxury, the expence

person; Who is here that <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> Son
of <hi>Antiochus Magnus,</hi> and second brother to <hi>Seleucus

for want of wit or parts, but for his actions and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
Which made the people when he would be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Epiphanes,</hi> which signifies <hi>Illustrious,</hi> call him
<hi>Epimanes,</hi> which denotes a <hi>mad man,</hi> as he was of a
cruel, turbulent spirit, and yet very servile, crouching
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59418:143"/>
and flattering where it was for his own Interest. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
he came unjustly to the Kingdom by defeating
his Nephew the Son of <hi>Seleucus Philopator.</hi> But <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
his short Character of him gathered out of <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
is most conspicuously applicable to the words
of the Text. <hi>Dicitur hic</hi> Antiochus, saith he, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectus,
ob mores, ab omni non tantùm Principis digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
sed ab honesti viri gravitate alienos. <hi>To whom
they shall not give the honour of the Kingdom.</hi>
               </hi> There
being no colour for it at all, by reason of his ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and which is the main of all, the right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
belonged to <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Son of his brother
<hi>Seleucus. <hi>But he shall come in peaceably, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Kingdom by flatteries,</hi> viz.</hi> by plausible
pretences of administring the affairs of the Kingdom
of <hi>Syria</hi> for the good of his Nephew <hi>Demetrius</hi> the
true heir to the crown, and by making a fair shew of
clemency and of kindness he shall win the hearts of
the people of <hi>Syria</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>The ancient Fathers some of them by this vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will have Antichrist alone to be understood, all
of them, supposing it to be <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> will
yet have him to be a lively Type of Antichrist. But
in this Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> the down-right
<hi>Literal</hi> sense is the sense aimed at, and the sense
intended as to the persons and actions described in it.
And therefore this prediction concerning <hi>Antiochus
Epiphanes</hi> is no more a prediction touching Antichrist,
than the History of the <hi>Iews</hi> a prediction of the State
of the Christians, and onely in this large sense can I
admit <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> to be a Type of the <hi>Papal
Hierarchy,</hi> or if you will of the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
by flattering and crouching at first to the Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
(consider the Letter of <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:59418:143"/>
which he wrote to <hi>Phocas</hi> when he had slain his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
<hi>Mauricius</hi> the Emperour:) By giving to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
all alluring titles of <hi>Servus Servorum;</hi> of <hi>holy
Father;</hi> of <hi>Sponsus Ecclesiae,</hi> &amp;c. And by pretending
the care of all Christian people, and of the Emperours
themselves whom they look'd upon always as pupils
in Nonage, young weakly Wights, Wights scarce nine
days old and that cannot see (for the <hi>little Horn</hi> only
must have eyes) from such fine pretences as these got
they the Government not onely of the people but
of the Emperours themselves whom they tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
upon, and made themselves in reality the
Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> and of Christendom in a
manner.</p>
            <p>That there is a conspicuous correspondency here
betwixt the <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Antitype</hi> I cannot deny, but
the <hi>Literal</hi> and <hi>Historical</hi> meaning as I may so speak
(for Prophecy, especially such an one as this, is a
kind of an Anticipatory History) that is the main
that is to be attended. We shall come to that part of the
Vision that speaks of Antichrist without a Type or

find <hi>Grotius</hi> to be one of the most easy and coherent
Interpreters, in whose footsteps therefore I shall

and then I shall shake hands with him and bid him
adiue.</p>
            <p>22. <hi>And with the arms of a floud shall they be
overflown from before him,</hi> namely <hi>Heliodorus</hi> his
forces who murdered <hi>Seleucus Demetrius</hi> his father,
prompted thereto perhaps by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> but doing
the feat with a design for himself, to get to himself
the Kingdom of <hi>Syria,</hi> he having raised forces for
this end. But <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> with a specious
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59418:144"/>
pretence, as doing all in behalf of his Nephew then

               </hi>
viz. <hi>Demetrius</hi> the son of <hi>Seleucus Philopator,</hi> who
may well be said to be the Prince of these Consede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
forces of his uncle <hi>Antiochus, Attalus</hi> and <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
he being indeed a Prince and heir to the Crown,
and this war against <hi>Heliodorus</hi> seeming to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in his behalf. But the good success turned to his
mischief by reason of the treachery of his uncle. And
therefore he is said to be broken here as well as the
followers of <hi>Heliodorus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. <hi>And after the league made with him,</hi> that is,
For after the friendship professed by him to his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
<hi>Demetrius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> with whom you may be
sure he kept Intelligence, <hi>He shall work deceitfully,</hi>
This is the cause that <hi>Antiochus</hi> his success against
<hi>Heliodorus</hi> was the undoing of <hi>Demetrius</hi> as well
as of him. <hi>He shall work deceitfully,</hi> by getting his

his father in kindness to <hi>Antiochus</hi> had sent him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for an hostage in his stead) that he might better
pursue his own designs in the mean time, as <hi>Grotius</hi>
has noted on the place. <hi>And he shall come up and
become strong with a small people.</hi> His beginnings
in <hi>Syria</hi> shall be small, saies <hi>Grotius,</hi> but he shall grow
up by degrees (as the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> did.)</p>
            <p>24. <hi>He shall enter peaceably even upon the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
places of the Province.</hi> By degrees <hi>Antiochus</hi>
will possess himself of the best places of <hi>Syria,</hi> as the
<hi>Roman Hierarchie</hi> of the fairest and fattest Seats in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59418:144"/>
               <hi>Europe. <hi>And he shall do that which his fathers have
not done, nor his fathers fathers, he shall scatter
among them the prey and spoil and riches,</hi>
               </hi> that is,
<hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> shall be a greater exacter of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
and more profuse rewarder of his favourites
and adherents, his souldiers especially, than any of
his ancestors. This lavish liberality of his is taken
notice of 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 3. 30. where he is said <hi>in giving
liberal gifts to have abounded above the Kings that
were before him.</hi> And the Papal Polity what tricks
they have to get money, to say nothing of bloud and
violence against pretended Hereticks, and how able
and lavish Rewarders they are of their stickling cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
is obvious to consider. None of the Emperours
of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Popes Predecessours, comparable to him
for that. <hi>Yea and he shall forecast his device against
the strong holds even for a time.</hi> After he had taken
the more easie and opime places, and encouraged
his soldiers by liberally dividing the spoil amongst
them, he afterward will set his mind to the taking
of the more strongly fortified places, which will
hold him longer tack and take him some time,
which haply is meant by [even for a time.] But
of the Hebrew it is better exprest thus [and that for
a time.]</p>
            <p>25. <hi>And he shall stir up his power and his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
against the King of the South with a great
Army,</hi> that is, Against the King of <hi>Aegypt, Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus
Philometor,</hi> because he pretended a right to
<hi>Syria. <hi>And the King of the South shall be stirred up
to battle with a great and mighty Army,</hi> viz. Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaeus
Philometor</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whose two chief
Commanders were <hi>Eulaius</hi> and <hi>Leneus. <hi>But he

him, but shall be put to flight and discomfited. <hi>For
they shall forecast devices against him.</hi> There will
be treacherous plots against <hi>Philometor</hi> and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>26. <hi>Yea they that feed of the portion of his meat
shall destroy him,</hi> that is, Some of his Domesticks,
Ministers of State, and of great trust in his affairs,
and in the very management of this War, will be
false to him and betray him, and undoe him, and spoil
the success of the battle. <hi>And his Army shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow,</hi>

They shall meet together at <hi>Memphis, Ptolemaeus

This palliated friendship will again break out into

and made of that Kingdom a Province. For partly
there, and partly in other places the <hi>Romans</hi> had a
great Navy ready for any exploit. <hi>Therefore shalt
he be grieved and return.</hi> The cause of his desist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from his enterprise of invading <hi>Aegypt</hi> and of
taking <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was <hi>Popilius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Legate
sent by the Senate to command him to forbear, the
King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> having put himself under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
Wherefore <hi>Popilius</hi> taking ship presently
upon this Commission sailed to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and imparted
the commands of the Senate to <hi>Antiochus.</hi> And
this is all the Ships of <hi>Chittim</hi> that came to him
then that I know. And I must confess I doubt
whether <gap reason="foreign">

Ships or no, and is not rather an Epithete of
the <hi>Chittim</hi> or Transmarine people, such as the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi>
and <hi>Romans</hi> were to them of <hi>Syria,</hi> and that
the rather because if it signify'd the ships of <hi>Chittim</hi>
it would not have been <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>And thus may it peculiarly. reflect upon <hi>Popilius</hi>
his rough handling of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who at his arrival
very complementally receiving him, and upon their
former familiarity at <hi>Rome</hi> offering to kiss him, was
bluntly bid to forbear those ceremonies; and the
decree of the Senate being produced and given him,
and he making delays and pretending it fit to consult
his friends, <hi>Popilius</hi> presently drawing a large circle
with his stick about <hi>Antiochus,</hi> bad him forthwith
consult his friends there upon the spot, nor pass out
of the circle till he had returned answer to the Senate
whether he would have war or peace with them;
which rough carriage of <hi>Popilius</hi> so humbled him
that he presently answered he would obey the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.

place</hi> or a <hi>Castle,</hi> and we may add, such here as
in which the God of <hi>Israel</hi> with his heavenly Hosts

the God of <hi>Israel</hi> being <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the <hi>God of Hosts,</hi>
whence the land of <hi>Israel</hi> was called the land of <hi>Sabi,</hi>

            <p>But this their entring and robbing the Temple
thus foreseen and predicted as well as permitted by
the God of <hi>Israel</hi> for the trial of the faithfull, is the
<hi>first</hi> degree of the <hi>prophanation</hi> thereof as <hi>Grotius</hi> has

they should follow the laws of the Gentiles, and
forbid burnt-offerings and sacrifices and drink-offerings
in the Temple, 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 1. 44. That they should
not serve God according to his own laws and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts,
but according to Paganick Rites prescribed
by this Type of Antichrist. And this silencing the
Law of God, and setting up the dictates of men is
the second degree of Profanation even according to
<hi>Grotius,</hi> and an inlet to the grossest prophanation ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
and therefore it orderly follows, <hi>And they
shall place the Abomination that maketh desolate,</hi>
The Hebrew word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59418:148"/>
either a <hi>stupifying</hi> Idol, or an Idol that makes <hi>deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
the <hi>Abomination of desolation,</hi> taking Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for Idol as it so signifies.</p>
            <p>And truly Idols in general in respect of them that
worship them willingly and superstitiously, may well
be called <hi>stupifying,</hi> it making their worshippers stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
as very blocks as themselves whom they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as to all sense of the true Religious worship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
<hi>They that make them are like unto them, and
so are all they that put their trust in them.</hi> And as for
those that know the great vanity and gross Impiety
of them, they are <hi>astonished</hi> to see that mortal men
should ever so far degenerate as to fall down on their
knees with their eyes and hands lift up to stocks and
stones. But that this should be in the Church of
God either <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi> whose hair would not
stand on end at so horrid and detestable a spectacle?
But these Idols may be said to make <hi>desolate,</hi> the
Church of God, suppose, in that they will fright all
good and conscientious men from her communion,
or cause them to be murdered or massacred, Myriads
of them, as it happened from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
for their not complying with her Idolatries. Such A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations
of desolation are Idols.</p>
            <p>But to come more particularly to the present Idol
brought into the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is the
third and last Profanation of the Temple, and which
drew along all disorder and uncleanness with it, it
is 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 1. 54. recorded thus. <hi>Now the fifteenth
day of the month Casleu in the hundred fourty and fifth
year they set up the Abomination of desolation upon
the Altar, and builded Idol Altars throughout the
Cities of Iudah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

in pieces the Books of the law which they found, they
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59418:148"/>
burnt them with fire,</hi> viz. That the people might not
be instructed thereby of the unlawfulness of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
Idols. Which answers in analogy to the
Popes forbidding the use of the Bible to the Laity,
because he has filled the Church of God with Images
and other trumperies, which the Bible declares against.
This is the Abomination of desolation in general, set
up in the Temple of God, though they have yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it no name: but 2 <hi>Macc.</hi> 6. 2. this same Idol
is <hi>Iupiter Olympius,</hi> as both <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us

            <p>The thing being to be done therefore, that it may

               </gap>,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Macc. 6. 1.</note> an <hi>old man of</hi> Athens,
a venerable Sophist I warrant you, to give them to

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Iupiter Olympius,</hi> that is, of the <hi>God of Heaven, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympus</hi>
signifying. Heaven with them, and <hi>Zeus</hi> that
God which according to the notation of his name is
the <hi>living God,</hi> and gives life and motion to all things:
and that their very Law or Scripture calls their God
the <hi>God of Heaven</hi> also, so that they will worship,
but the same God still, and thus the whole Kingdom
of <hi>Antiochus</hi> will be of one Catholick Religion, the
<hi>Iews</hi> joyning with the rest in the same worship.
Which will be much for the honour, safety and peace
of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Kingdome. And as for the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Image, would that reverend Sophist say,
that we directing our intention aright, the worship
of the <hi>Type</hi> passes to the <hi>Prototype,</hi> and that we do
not give divine worship to the Image, but such as it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59418:149"/>
is capable of, nor to the rest of the Inferiour Gods,
whose Altars might be set in other parts of <hi>Iudea,</hi>
but such is meant to them as they are capable of, and
no more.</p>
            <p>At which grave Harangue of this old Greek,
the Apostate party might find themselves much edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,

it is most safe to hold to the plain and obvious
sense of that Doctrine which is delivered by <hi>Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
And the like just and safe appeal there is of the
reformed Churches to <hi>Scripture</hi> given by <hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
in the plain and apert sense thereof, against
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But by the Sophistry of that
<hi>old Athenian,</hi> if they will listen to his deceitfull spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
they may be seduced to worship not onely <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter

<hi>Hell</hi> with their most deformed and affrightfull Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
such as the <hi>Indians</hi> Idols are, in reference to that
great and <hi>terrible</hi> God, as he is in judgment, as well
as infinitely sweet and alluring in mercy, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of their being the ministers of his wrath, and
that we intend no higher worship to them than is due.
Wherefore the worship of God is the most safely boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by his own <hi>inspired</hi> word, not by the <hi>humour some</hi>
or <hi>fraudulent</hi> and <hi>self-interessed</hi> prescripts of men, or

            <p>But now for this Idol of <hi>Iupiter Olympius</hi> its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an Abomination of <hi>desolation,</hi> it was so in that
it caused the Temple to be left desolate and deserted
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59418:149"/>
of all good men, driving them into secret places
wheresoever they could fly for shelter, and it is said,
1 <hi>Macc. 4. 37. How the Sanctuary was desolate and

Those that had merchandized and given money

to comply with his Idolatrous designs. Where we
may observe, Earthly-mindedness, Covetousness and
Ambition in the Priesthood what an occasion it is of,
and what a prop to Idolatry and the corrupting the
worship of God. <hi>But the people that do know their
God. <hi>Calvin</hi>
               </hi> well upon this place says, <hi>Cognitio au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
hîc non tantundem valet ac frigida Imaginatio,
sed accipitur pro fide quae radicem vivam egit in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus.</hi>
This knowledge, says he, of God is no frigid
Imagination, but is Faith that has a living root in the
heart, which implies a purity there, from whence all
firm assurance of knowledg in Divine matters doth
arise. And that is pitifull knowledg indeed that has
not firm assurance. For how can we be said to know
what we are not assured of that it is true? It is vain
Imagination and conceit but not knowledg, such as
a man will adventure any thing upon. And hence it
is that men crumple so in persecution, in that they do
not know God with any assurance, their hearts being
not purified sufficiently for such a kind of knowledg,
and real sense of God, as it were, according to that
saying of our Saviour, <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59418:150"/>
for they shall see God,</hi> and act always as in his sight
and presence, which will give them invincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and fortitude, whiles they are assured, that He
looks on in whom they trust, and for whom they
suffer, and who will plenteously reward their fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to him. <hi>Shall be strong and doe exploits,</hi> that is,
by the strength and power of God, and by Faith in
his assistance, they will not be forced through the
threats of mortal men, be they never so great and
potent, to forsake the law of God, or to relinquish
their loyalty to him, who brings these persecutions
on his people, on purpose to try them. Wherefore
if they prove faithless and disloyal to him, the note of
condemnation is branded upon their own conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whereby it shall be either enraged with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
disquietness, or hardened into eternal deadness
and stupidity. Which is a sad thing and worth our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
consideration.</p>
            <p>But as for the fullfilling of this Prophecy touching
the exploits they doe that truly know God, and are
not mere <hi>sons</hi> of <hi>talk</hi> and <hi>Imagination,</hi> besides both the
Books of the <hi>Maccabees, Iosephus</hi> also witnesses to it
lib. 12. cap. 7. where he says, though many of the
<hi>Iews</hi> partly of their own accord, and partly to avoid
the punishment threatned by King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to them
that disobeyed his command (which command was
to disobey <hi>Moses</hi> and embrace Gentilism) they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to what he decreed, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which are here the <hi>people that knew
God,</hi> they listened not to him, but had more regard
to the Law of God, than to the threats of King <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi>
against those that Disobeyed his Decree, and
accordingly they endured murders and tortures, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than they would forsake the law of God. Which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59418:150"/>
is a lively Type of the sufferings of Gods people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Antichrist</hi> for adhering closely to the law and
will of Christ, and avoiding that Pagan-like worship
of Idols, that Antichrist has introduced into the
Church of God.</p>
            <p>33. <hi>And they that understand among the people
shall instruct many.</hi> These that understand among
the people are those that before were said to know
their God from such a principle of life in their heart,
and not in dry Imaginative opinion. These there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being assured of the truth, whether <hi>Priests</hi> or
<hi>Lay-men,</hi> instructed many. For so <hi>Gasper Sanctius</hi> says,
<hi>Hi vero non sunt Scribae aut legis Doctores,</hi> &amp;c. These
were not the Scribes or Doctors of the Law, but
men that studied the Law for that purpose that they
might keep it, such as <hi>Mattathias</hi> and <hi>Iudas Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeus,</hi>
who incouraged many to the observance of the
Law, with the peril of their lives, and made, that
they willingly underwent killing with the sword,
burning, captivity, and a thousand such like jeopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
says he. And <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> speaks much-what
to the same sense, interpreting those that <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
among the people,</hi> though of the <hi>Priests</hi> chiefly,
yet also of the <hi>Laity.</hi> Which is therefore the more
lively Type of those that encouraged the people of
God against the Idolatrous tyranny of Antichrist,
there being those that instructed them so, both of
the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity.</hi> So that the Ponti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

have no reason to lay such things in the dish of the
Reformed, these of their own Church here approving
of it. For both <hi>Gasper Sanctius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius à Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
were members of the Church of <hi>Rome. <hi>Yet they
shall fall,</hi>
               </hi> read rather, Though they shall fall, <hi>By
the sword, and by the flame, and by captivity, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59418:151"/>
by spoil many daies.</hi> Though these things be in
their eyes, and they be in a manner certain to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
them, to be either killed by the sword,
burnt at the stake, banished out of their countrey,
or despoiled of their goods, yet those that <hi>know their
God,</hi> will not desist to instruct those they have the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to instruct touching their duty in Religion,
and adherence to the true worship of God, nor will
others be discouraged to follow their counsell, to
keep a good conscience, nor be driven to <hi>Gentilism</hi>
by the terrour of men, they knowing whom they
serve, and being so sure of their reward. Else it were
as if there were no God upon Earth, and that the
Supreme Power of every Countrey were absolutely
the God of that Countrey, and that there were no
difference of moral good or evil, nor any Religion
truer or more obligatory one than another, which is
the very <hi>Quintessence</hi> of <hi>Atheism.</hi> But this pious
party of the <hi>Iews</hi> was otherwise persuaded, and stood
to the truth with the hazard of their lives, and all that
they had, as is copiously set down in the books of
the <hi>Maccabees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>34. <hi>Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen

for the purity of his worship, but their adherence
will be from By-respects of <hi>Ambition</hi> or <hi>Covetousness,</hi>
or the like, of each which we see an example in some
of those that sided with <hi>Iudas Maccabaeus</hi> against
<hi>Antiochus</hi> his forces. Of <hi>Ambition</hi> and desire of Fame
in <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Azarias,</hi> who when they had heard of
the valiant acts which <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> had done,
said, <hi>Let us also get us a name,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 5. 55.
But their success was accordingly, for they were
routed by <hi>Gorgias,</hi> and slain of them two thousand
men, vers. 60.</p>
            <p>But the example of <hi>Covetousness</hi> is that in those
slain in the battle which <hi>Iudas</hi> fought with <hi>Gorgias</hi>
the Governour of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> the men of <hi>Iudas</hi> his
side that were slain were such as under whose coats
were found things consecrated to Idols of the <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
or <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> would have it, which
is forbidden the <hi>Iews</hi> by the law. Here we see plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that some of <hi>Iudas</hi> his company, who was himself
so sincere a zealot for the true worship of God, adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Cause, part out of <hi>Ambition,</hi> part out of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,</hi>
which therefore was a more infirm or lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricous
adhesion. And it were desirable that those who
oppose <hi>Antichrist</hi> as these did the Type of him, <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
Epiphanes,</hi> held together in a more sincere prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and then the opposing of him, I mean in <hi>Polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Theology (for I have nothing to do with other
<hi>Polemicks</hi> or <hi>Politicks)</hi> would prove more successful.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Calvins</hi> complaint in his time upon this Text,
That in that little number that had withdrawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Idolatries of the Papacy, <hi>major pars,</hi>
says he, <hi>plena est perfidiâ &amp; dolis,</hi> which is something
an harsh censure understanding it in the grosser way,
as if they wittingly and resolvedly were such. But so
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59418:152"/>
few are touched with the sincere and hearty love of
the pure worship of God, or oppose the Papacy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this just and laudable jealousy for His Honour and
the Support of the Power of true Religion and right
knowledg of God, such as destroys the body of sin
in us, that being encumbred with these unknown Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

or better assured that many things in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
are grosly false, than that the great articles of
Religion, wherein we seem generally agreed on all
sides, are assuredly true, or that not so much the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Gods worship as the splendour, power and
worldly Interest of the Priesthood is to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of a prudent and well moderated Reformation;
I say mens minds and consciences being darkened
with such prejudices, and they seeking their own
<hi>Interest,</hi> or following their own <hi>Humour,</hi> rather than
sincerely affecting that the power of true and pure
Religion should prevail, it is no wonder we have no

words do more fully assure us. <hi>To try them to
purge and to make them white.</hi> And therefore these
troubles that seem so direfull and Tragical to mortal
men, proceed from the love of God to his own, that
he may make them more pure and consequently better
fitted for Communion with himself. And this is that
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> suggests, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 17. For our light afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
(and such is all that wicked men can inflict upon
the true servants of God, who will never suffer
them to be tempted above what they can bear)
<hi>which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
exceeding and eternal weight of Glory, while we look
not at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen: For the things which are seen
are Temporal, but the things that are not seen are
Eternal. <hi>Even to the time of the end,</hi>
               </hi> that is, To
the time of their ending. For God had set his time
wherein these afflictions of his Church should end,
as bounding all human affairs by his Power and
Providence, so that there may be a respiration
to his people from these extremities of affliction.
And therefore there is put an end to this affliction
of his Church, because it was foreseen that another
would begin, as it is intimated to us by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
according to the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is an Elliptical speech as was observed
above v. 27. Which verbatim is thus to be rendred,
<hi>Because yet-again at the time appointed,</hi> subaudi,
There will be a persecution of my People or Church,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59418:153"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, whose succession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
in the next verse, For hitherto is described from
vers. 21. the Reign and feats of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi>
But that now the times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
both the mention of <hi>A Time and Times and
half a time,</hi> Ch. 12. 7. and those other numbers
there vers. 11. that point to them, and that vast
gap that would be betwixt <hi>Antiochus</hi> his time and
the Resurrection of the dead mentioned v. 2. may
sufficiently assure us. To which you may add that
the Passage here from the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire to the <hi>Roman</hi>
in the next verse, is as distinct and plain as from the
<hi>Persian</hi> to the <hi>Greek</hi> vers. 3. and the like great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
and Prosperity expressed in both, in that of both
Kings it is said, <hi>And he shall do according to his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* Which therefore cannot be understood of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>
Whence they that would drag what follows of
the Prophecy to that scope are fain to run back
and apply the same things that were predicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and so make the Prophecy to tautologize. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
many things are most wretchedly distorted
and very weakly and faintly accommodated to the
person of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> Which <hi>Calvin</hi> being sensible of
applies all to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire from the times of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire after <hi>Antiochus</hi> his death, to the
coming of Christ. In which besides that many things
are dilute or forced, he leaves a vast gap as well as
those others, <hi>viz.</hi> from the beginning of the Gospel
to the Resurrection. Which makes the Prophecy
less worthy of that Pompous Preface to it, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Prefatory vision Ch. 10. as I noted above.</p>
            <p>Wherefore there can be no doubt with them that
consider the matter, but that this Prophecy of the
<hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> does not only here pass from the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59418:153"/>
               <hi>Greek</hi> Empire to the <hi>Roman</hi> upon the death of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus,</hi>
and the vanquishing of <hi>Perseus</hi> the last King
of <hi>Macedonia</hi> by <hi>Aemylius Paulus,</hi> and turning his
Kingdom into a <hi>Roman</hi> Province, but that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
continuedly goes on, though in general strokes,
through the whole series of times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to the end of the world, or general Resurrection.
And that as there has hitherto been predictions <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and <hi>Literally</hi> or <hi>Historically</hi> to be understood of the
affairs of the <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Kingdome, and more
particularly of those two parts thereof the Kingdoms
of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where the <hi>real</hi> gests of <hi>Antiochus
Epiphanes</hi> are foretold, and are but onely as other
Historical parts of Scripture drawn to a <hi>Typical</hi> sense;
so whatever follows touching the affairs of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire has a plain Historical meaning, and is so
to be understood, till its utter dissolution. So that
there will be no room left for such a Chimerical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
as some of the Fathers have fancied, and others
have been either themselves such children, or would
have others to be such, as to believe them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bidding adieu to <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> and laying aside
all the fancifull and Chimerical Crotchets of mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Antiquity, I shall clear the sense of the remaining
part of this Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> as
follows.</p>
            <p>36. <hi>And the King shall do according to his will,
and shall exalt himself and magnify himself above
every God.</hi> This may be understood of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire at large, and the words be rendred thus, <hi>Then
shall a King do according to his will,</hi> shall have all
things go prosperously according to his desire, by
<hi>King</hi> understanding here as it is elsewhere in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
a <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Kingdome,</hi> which is here the <hi>Roman</hi> upon
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59418:154"/>
the expiration of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, <hi>Macedonia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conquered by the <hi>Romans,</hi> of which <hi>Perseus</hi> was
the last King contemporary to <hi>Antiochus</hi> whom <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
foretels to reign Ch. 8. in the latter time of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Kingdome. And therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> is very
fitly here supposed to succeed it, after <hi>Antiochus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes,</hi>
the rest of his Successours being taken no
notice of, for the same reasons that all but one after
<hi>Xerxes</hi> are past by in the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire. And this
<hi>Roman</hi> King or Kingdome is said to magnify himself
above every God, in that the <hi>Romans</hi> by sacred charms
called out the Gods of those Cities they conquered,
and so as it were led them captive to <hi>Rome.</hi> See my
<hi>Synops. Prophet.</hi> Book 2. Ch. 10. <hi>And shall speak mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous
things,</hi> that is, blasphemous, <hi>against the God
of Gods,</hi> that is, The officers of this <hi>Roman</hi> Power
shall do so, namely against Christ Jesus himself, who
was truly God as well as man, and therefore the God
of Gods; and yet was he in word and deed most <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfully</hi>
used by them and <hi>crucified.</hi> And how the
God of of Gods, <hi>viz.</hi> the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was despised by
the <hi>Romans,</hi> a man may collect from that greatest
Wit of the <hi>Roman Empire, Marcus Cicero,</hi> and one of
the best men of them, who yet speaks but contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptibly
of the Religion of the <hi>Iews</hi> as unworthy of the
greatness of the <hi>Roman</hi> name and Empire, and insults
over their Nation as less befriended by the Gods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were vanquished and subjected to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
If a person of his quality went so far in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> what would others of
less sagacity and morality blurt out? See his oration
<hi>pro Flacco. <hi>And shall prosper till the Indignation be

done.</hi>
               </hi> And yet they shall prosper notwithstanding
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59418:154"/>
this their villany towards Christ, and bloudy persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his members wherein he was again reproached
and blasphemed, till the determined time of this
rage ran out, and that the Empire became Christian,
which was certainly determined to be done, under
the sixth Seal.</p>
            <p>37. <hi>Neither shall he regard the God of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
that is, The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire becoming Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
will cast off the Gods of their Ancestours, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shier
the old Pagan Religion. <hi>Nor the desire of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
that is, Marriage will not be in that high esteem
then as it was with the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> as those
Laws testify which were called <hi>Iulia</hi> and <hi>Papia,</hi>
which <hi>Constantine</hi> abrogated. This I say may be
one sense of the foregoing verse and of this part of this,
and so take in all the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire from
the beginning of the Gospel at least, to the times of
the Apostasy of the Church, or of the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Beast <hi>that was and is not and yet is.</hi> By a
<hi>Geniconoea,</hi> as I may so speak, this may be the sense
of the foregoing verse and this part of this. But by an
<hi>Idiconoea,</hi> I conceive, with the Ancients, that the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
sense is, that which concerns that <hi>Antichrist</hi>
which undoubtedly <hi>Paul</hi> aims at 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. And
therefore emboldened by his authority I shall para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
the foregoing verse and this hitherto, thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then shall a King, &amp;c.</hi> i.e. After the Reign of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
Epiphanes,</hi> that Type of Antichrist, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
enemy of the people of God in the <hi>Greek</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
shall there arise a <hi>Rex Sacrorum,</hi> or Royal Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex
if you will, who with his formed body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
or Ecclesiastical Power shall prove the very Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
indeed, answering in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to that
wicked <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the Greek, and both of them
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59418:155"/>
placed in the latter times of each Empire. Which
Ecclesiastical Prince or Pontifex finding the stream of
Affairs and good fortune to carry him along, <hi>shall at
last exalt himself above every God,</hi> i.e. every Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magistrate, the Emperour himself not excepted,
nay shall speak strange blasphemous words against
the Sovereignty of God himself, as if he had power
to abrogate and dispense with the laws of God and
Christ, and were himself <hi>Supremum Numen in terris.</hi>
Which impieties he will prosperously carry on for
such a time as Divine Providence shall permit, that
is for <hi>a Time and Times and half a Time,</hi> at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
of which his Kingdome shall begin to be
broken.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all this wickedness he shall
not be a pure <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan, nor shall he regard the
Gods of his Ancestours or Predecessours (that is, of
the Supreme Magistrates of <hi>Rome</hi> who Reigned there
a long time before him) such Deities, I say, as <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
Mars, Iupiter Capitolinus,</hi> and the like. But
this shall be notable in him, that he shall be outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a strict professour of a single life, and it shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Pontifical office to marry, and likewise
his Clergy shall be tyed to the same laws, that
he may thereby the better promote the designs
of his Rampant and Insatiable Ambition. Which
spirit of pride and worldliness shall grow so
rank in him, that he shall in time cast off the real
sense of all Religion, as it follows in the Text. <hi>Nor
regard any God: for he shall magnify himself above
all.</hi> And therefore he will subordinate all Religion
to his own worldly advantage and Interest. Whence
it will be, that he will amongst other things make no
conscience of Idolatry, as it follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:59418:155"/>38. <hi>But in his estate shall he honour the God of

i.e. <hi>And he shall make the Holds
of the Mahuzzim jointly to the foreign God.</hi> As if we
should say, the <hi>Holds of the</hi> Mahuzzim <hi>with the foreign
God,</hi> i.e. the Holds jointly made to them both, or jointly
appertaining to them both. Which are Churches and
Monasteries dedicated to Christ (for he is this foreign
God, partly as being a <hi>Iew</hi> by birth not a Gentile, much
less a <hi>Roman,</hi> and partly as being really <hi>God-man,</hi> which
is such a strange and foreign Deity as the <hi>Romans,</hi>

together with this or that Saint; and elegantly
here are these Churches and Monasteries called <hi>Holds,</hi>
in reference to <hi>Mahuzzim,</hi> which has a warlike sense

there are accounted strong Castles and Towers of
defence, by the superstitious followers of Antichrist.

At his devotion, so Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> And thus far the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
seems clear, being applied to times past. But
what follows is to come, and therefore the sense more
uncertain, and being so little is likely to reach at times
more distant. And we are already at the seventh
Trumpet, with which begin the seven Vials, and I
suspect in this so contracted a Prophecy, that aims
onely at main things, and such especially as concern
the Church of Christ, and here treats of the scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
upon Antichrist from the <hi>Saracen</hi> and <hi>Turk,</hi> that
there may be a leap to the sixth and seventh Vials, in
the latter whereof Antichrist or the bloudy Idolatrous
Papal Hierarchy is utterly ruined, which is a thing so
considerable, that it is unlikely to be omitted in this
Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>44. <hi>But tidings out of the East and out of the
North shall trouble him,</hi> that is, shall trouble the
<hi>Turk</hi> Which tidings out of the <hi>East</hi> may very well
contemporize with the sixth Vial, which is poured
out upon the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> whereby its waters are
dried up, and a way to the Kings of the East prepared,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59418:158"/>
which shews some grand mutation of affairs and
jeopardy that the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire in those Eastern
parts will seem to be in, at that time: But the tidings
out of the <hi>North</hi> may be of a most formidable strength
of <hi>Tartars</hi> invading the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire at the same
time, it may be converted to the Christian Religion.
And <hi>Peganius,</hi> I remember, in his Exposition of the
sixth Vial, interprets the Kings of the East of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
and <hi>Persians.</hi> But the <hi>Tartars</hi> are to be look'd upon
as a people from the <hi>North</hi> rather than from the <hi>East,</hi> as
this Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> expresses it. The <hi>Tartars</hi> their
first driving the <hi>Turks</hi> on this side of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> made
them overflow so, that by degrees making themselves
masters of <hi>Asia Minor,</hi> they at last got into <hi>Europe,</hi> took
<hi>New Rome</hi> or <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and seized themselves
of the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Empire. And what <hi>this</hi>
Driving of them here mentioned will doe, God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
certainly knows. But it seems the same and
rumour of this Incursion of the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi>
casteth the <hi>Turk</hi> into a great anxiety of mind, and
an equal rage, as is intimated in what follows.
<hi>Therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy,
and utterly to make away many,</hi> that is, any by
whose destruction and overthrow he may think it
probable further to strengthen himself against those
imminent dangers he is so sensible of, or to compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate
his losses.</p>
            <p>45. <hi>And he shall plant the Tabernacles of his
Palace betweéen the Seas in the glorious Holy
Mountain.</hi> This Interpreters ordinarily understand
of his entring into <hi>Iudaea,</hi> because of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
here used, which they make a character of the land
of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and will have the Mountain Mount <hi>Sion</hi>
and <hi>Moria,</hi> where the Temple stands, betwixt two
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59418:158"/>
Seas, the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Mare Mortuum,</hi> whenas
if you consult the Maps of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> and <hi>Adrichomius,
Ierusalem</hi> lies manifestly North of <hi>Mare Mortuum,</hi> and
therefore it cannot well be said to lye betwixt the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterraneum</hi>
and it, it being nearer the North Pole than
the most Northern part of <hi>Mare Mortuum.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
this land of <hi>Iudaea</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> had entred and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
before ver. 41. Therefore this seems some new
Exploit and Acquist in some other countrey betwixt
two Seas, and where is to be found a glorious Holy
Mountain. Now for the Countrey betwixt two Seas,
it is manifest that <hi>Italy</hi> is such, being placed betwixt
<hi>Mare Adriaticum</hi> and <hi>Mare Tyrrhenum,</hi> which are also
called <hi>Mare Superum</hi> and <hi>Mare Inferum.</hi> And then for

to the Temple, where the Glory of the

belonging to that City betwixt these two Seas, and
these are the Hills and City of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which being
the Metropolis of Holy Church, or the Papal Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59418:159"/>
and the seat of his <hi>Holiness</hi> so called, it is no

               </gap> were a proper note of

but figuratively it may be used to signify another
place. As it is said of the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> though

was the <hi>anointed Cherub</hi> and set upon the <hi>holy

Stones in <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Breastplate: If these things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

               </gap>
which may seem to belong properly to <hi>Iudaea</hi> and
the Temple there, be applied to Antichrist <hi>himself,</hi>
especially it hitting so fitly as it does in vertue of
other significations of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it signifying

exalts himself above all that is called God or worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks. And so it will be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in good earnest, the Hill of a very <hi>tumid</hi> though
not solid <hi>Supremum Numen in terris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is <hi>Har Zebi,</hi> the Hill of him that puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the place of God, as it is said to the King of
<hi>Tyre</hi> his Type, who is said also to have <hi>swelled</hi>
himself into the conceit of being a God. <hi>Because
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59418:159"/>
thy heart is lifted up and thou sayst I am a God, and
sit, in Cathedra Dei,</hi> so the vulgar Latin has it, <hi>in
the heart of the Seas,</hi> that is, not at the North end
nor South end, but in the midst space of <hi>Italy</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
betwixt two seas <hi>Mare superum</hi> and <hi>Mare infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.
Behold therefore I will bring strangers upon
thee the terrible of the Nations,</hi> namely the <hi>Turk,</hi>
and vers. 9. <hi>Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth
thee I am God, but thou shalt be a man and no God
in the hand of him that slayeth thee,</hi> whether <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi>
or, which is far more probable and desirable,
<hi>Politically,</hi> that is, despoils him there of his rule
and Power. See my <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> Book 2.
ch. 16. where I explain these Visions of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
touching the King of <hi>Tyre;</hi> and consider but
what I have writ, and I think you cannot doubt
but that the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Roman Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
is concerned in those Visions, and that he is to
fall by the terrible of the Nations, and very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
by the King of the North here in this Vision,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Turk.</hi> But by this description in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
what a <hi>Zebi</hi> Antichrist is, that is, what a <hi>turgid
and tumid thing,</hi> as <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> interprets the
word, <hi>swoln</hi> and <hi>puffed up</hi> into a conceit of being <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premum
Numen in terris,</hi> is fitly set out.</p>
            <p>But that his Power will be surmounted and that
he will be brought down by the King of the North
the <hi>Turk,</hi> is intimated in the following words of this
verse <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Our English translation
renders it, <hi>Yet he shall come to his end and none
shall help him.</hi> Which I conceive is not so natural
a sense, nor so consentaneous to the drift of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
in hand, touching the Man of sin or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.
Wherefore the <hi>vulgar Latin</hi> and <hi>Vatablus</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59418:160"/>
render it better. To which <hi>Gasper Sanctius</hi> also as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
and <hi>Maldonat. Et veniet us<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ad summitatem ejus
&amp; nemo auxiliabitur illi. And he shall come to the top
of it,</hi> viz. <hi>of the Hill,</hi> (suppose Mount <hi>Coelius)</hi> and
no man shall help it, that is, the <hi>Hill,</hi> and rescue it
out of his hand, so <hi>Maldonat</hi> and others. Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that the King of the North will make himself
perfect master of this Hill or Hills and City of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and that no man will hinder him * by rescuing the
Hill, and consequently the City and Seat of the Pope,
out of his hand. But then will be fulfilled, at least
within this seventh Vial, that Prediction touching the
King of <hi>Babylon</hi> or Antichrist by <hi>Isaias,</hi> Ch. 14. which
I had occasion to mention also above. <hi>All the Kings
of the Nations, even all of them lye in glory, every
one in his own house. But thou art cast out of thy grave
like an abominable branch, as a carcass troden under
foot, because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy
people;</hi> as it is said of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which
is the same Polity, <hi>that in her was found the bloud
of Prophets and of Saints, and of all that were slain upon
the Earth.</hi> In this taking of <hi>Rome</hi> therefore by the
<hi>Turk,</hi> and his possessing of himself of <hi>Italy</hi> will the
Western Empire be extinguished, as well as the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
was by the taking of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and that
will come to pass before the expiring of the seventh
Vial, that is written <hi>Apoc.</hi> Ch. 19. <hi>And the Beast
was taken and with him the false Prophet, and were
cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to the comfort of all good Christians, the
King of the North or <hi>Turk</hi> * shall be slain with the
sword of him that sits on the White Horse, that is, he
shall be converted to Christianity in all likelihood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the intimations of those Prophecies in the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59418:160"/>
Apocalypse, which also place these things under the
pouring forth of the seventh Vial. Which taking of
<hi>Rome</hi> under this Vial makes it seem less probable,
though not impossible, that the pouring out of the
fifth Vial upon the Seat of the Beast should be the
taking of <hi>Rome</hi> too, but some other calamity upon
it, which is more easy to conceive, than needfull to
utter. In the mean time I think it very rational to
expound this last verse, as I have, of the destruction
of Antichrist at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> having taken <hi>Iudaea</hi>
and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> before, and the <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
far off, nor any <hi>Holy</hi> Hill there betwixt
two Seas to be found that I know of; and it being
also incredible, that this Prophecy describing so
lively the Idolatrous State of Antichrist, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of his Punishment under the fifth and sixth
Trumpets, should not glance at his final destruction
under the seventh, that the Prophecy may seem, as
it is not without an head, so not to be without a foot.
The Prophecies of the <hi>metalline Image,</hi> and the <hi>four
Beasts,</hi> that reach to the end of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
as this does, speak of the destruction of it in the last
period thereof, namely of the feet and toes and of the
little Horn with eyes. Therefore there is all reason
that this Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> should
do so too. Which it does not, unless this last verse of
this eleventh Chapter be understood of the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

place, namely this present passage of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
Ch. 11. 30. <hi>Supervenient enim naves Chittim.</hi>
Here he makes no question but that these ships of
<hi>Chittim</hi> are the ships of the <hi>Romans,</hi> because the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Latin has <hi>Romani</hi> for <hi>Chittim;</hi> which exposition,
says he, the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers follow, and of
the Hebrew Writers <hi>Iosephus Ben Gorion, Selomo
Iarchi, R. Saadias Gaon, Aben Ezra, Iosephus Iac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiades,</hi>
which is a competent plea of authority.</p>
               <p>And for the more credibility of the matter he
further adds, that in <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassaeus,</hi> there
occurs the City <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> situated in <hi>Latium,</hi> one of the
great and populous Cities taken by <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> There
is also <hi>Cetus</hi> flu. near <hi>Cumae</hi> that petrifies plants
according to <hi>Aristotle.</hi> He adds also that <hi>Eusebius,
Chronicon Alexandrinum, Cedrenus, Suidas</hi> affirm
the <hi>Latins</hi> to have their Original from the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying,
<hi>occultus, absconditus.</hi> These are pretty
Criticisms and the fruit of laudable wit and reading;
but whether we are to confide in this more precise
notion that makes <hi>Chittim</hi> signify the <hi>Romans</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and adequately, or in that more large accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59418:162"/>out of <hi>Iosephus</hi> mentioned in my Exposition, I
leave to the Reader to use his own judgment in.
But whether way soever you take it, by <hi>Chittim</hi>
the <hi>Romans</hi> will easily and naturally be understood,
from the genuine sense and coherence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
               <p>Vers. 35. <hi>Which therefore cannot be understood of
Antiochus.]</hi> Indeed <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> is said some
two years after he had prophaned the Temple at
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> with Idolatry, to have made a third Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and upon <hi>Physcon</hi> his account to
have expelled <hi>Philometor</hi> his brother out of the whole
Kingdom, and to have entred a league and shared
the Government of that Kingdom with <hi>Physcon.</hi> But
he had scarce setled these affairs, but the Romans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
were on his back out of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and a sad ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
out of the East of the King of <hi>Parthia</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
his Kingdom on that side, and that <hi>Iudaea</hi>
also had revolted came to his ear, and in the midst
of his stickling to obviate these difficulties and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
himself out of the confusions he was in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the space of a year or thereabout he was cut off
by an inglorious and lamentable death. How well
this suits with that phrase, <hi>A King shall do according
to his will,</hi> (which signifies the greatest prosperity
that may be in the style of this Prophecy) let any
one judge.</p>
               <p>Vers. 39. <hi>Military Protectours and Champions,</hi> &amp;c.]
Here, where <hi>Mahuzzim</hi> is joyned with <hi>Holds,</hi> it is
requisite the Word should signify <hi>Persons,</hi> that is,
<hi>Protectours, Defenders, Guardians, Helpers,</hi> as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

part 1. There can be no doubt of the sense of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huzzim</hi>
in this personal signification. And in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two places, where <hi>Mahuzzim</hi> are named, though
it were translated, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
<hi>Walls, Towers, Bulwarks</hi> and the like, yet the
persons of the Saints or <hi>Daemons</hi> are easily understood
thereby, forasmuch as the antient Fathers gave those
very names to the Saints in reference to their reliques
disposed of in this or that Church or Monastery. I
will onely add one citation of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s out of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret,</hi>
(who calls the holy Martyrs, Guardians of
Cities, Lieutenants of Places, Captains of men, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Champions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are plainly Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
terms,) and so leave the Reader to see the rest
in that excellent Authour in the abovesaid place.
But hence it is plain how wonderfull easy and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
the Exposition of this place of <hi>Daniel</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Vers. 45. <hi>Or the Hill of</hi> Sabi Kodesh <hi>of the God
who is called his holiness.]</hi> That the Pope affects a
kind of Divinity was the complaint of <hi>Frederick</hi> the
second, and how he is twice placed upon the holy
Altar (which is the proper Throne of the body
of Christ) after his Election and at his Coronation
you may see in <hi>Laurentius Bank</hi> his <hi>Roma Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,</hi>
and what adorations are done unto him. And
in the Gloss of the Canon Law the Pope is called
<hi>Dominus Deus noster, Our Lord God,</hi> as Bishop <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
has noted in his <hi>De Antichristo,</hi> lib. 4. cap. 10.
And there are many passages to that purpose in their
Canonists and Theologers who think fit to give
all the names to the Pope that are given to Christ
to assert his Primacy over the Church, <hi>Powel, De
Antichristo</hi> lib. 1. c. 15. <hi>thes.</hi> 32. And therefore <hi>Sabi</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:59418:163"/>which no man can deny to be justly given to Christ,
may be given to the Pope. And <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which
the <hi>Septuagint</hi> render <hi>Ierem.</hi> 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>God Omnipotent,</hi> suits excellently well with what the
Canonists call <hi>Omnipotentiam Pontificiam</hi> the <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
of the Pope, In Papa omnem esse potestatem su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra
omnes potestates tam Caeli quàm terrae,</hi> which Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Downham</hi> cites as the saying of an Arch-Bishop
of that Church in a publick oration of his in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran,</hi>
and there are several to that purpose as you may
see them cited by Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> and by <hi>Gabriel
Powell</hi> in their Books <hi>De Antichristo.</hi> So that the
Pope is a <hi>Sabi Sabaoth</hi> indeed, and take it in the most
military sense, he is, as one predicted of him, that
<hi>Rex Superbiae cui paratur sacerdotum exercitus,</hi> that
King of Pride with his Army of Priests, of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ranks, and as well ordered, as themselves will
not stick to acknowledge, as an Army with Banners.
So little unfitness is there that the Pope should be
called <hi>Sabi,</hi> Scoptically, by the Prophet, he in the
mean time in good earnest foretelling how immens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he would extoll himself and be extolled by his
own.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Kodesh</hi> is added that there may be no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
and that we may understand that the same
<hi>Sabi</hi> is not here meant that is meant vers. 41.
(where the land of <hi>Iudaea</hi> is called the land <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
of that true and eminent, of that solid (not tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid)
<hi>Sabi,</hi> even of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> himself.
But here this Hill, the Hill <hi>Coelius</hi> in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
(where the Popes proper Imperial Palace is
and Chair of State, whose feet are as high as the
top of the Emperors Chair and other great Princes)
is onely called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Hill of <hi>Sabi,</hi> not of that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59418:163"/>true and eminent <hi>Sabi,</hi> the God of <hi>Israel) Kodesh,</hi>
I say, is added, that no man may miss of who is
meant thereby, namely, his Holiness of <hi>Rome.</hi> For
this is his known Title, nothing more celebrated. And
that it may be the Title of a man, notwithstanding
it is the feminine gender and in the abstract, <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
à Lapide</hi> very well makes out upon <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24.
where says he, <hi>Sanctitas Sanctitatum,</hi> the <hi>most Holy,</hi>
is to be understood of Christ not of the Temple, and
signifies no more than <hi>Sanctus Sanctorum</hi> or <hi>Sanctissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
Sic Pontificem,</hi> says he, <hi>vocamus Sua Sanctitas,</hi>
that is, <hi>Sanctissimus Dominus;</hi> and <hi>Gasper Sanctius</hi> on
the same place speaks to the same purpose. What
can be more easy or plain? So manifest is it that no
Grammatical or Critical violence is done to the
Text by thus expounding of it, but by the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of things and of the Context, the place thus
expounds itself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By rescuing the Hill and consequently the City,</hi> &amp;c.]
I do not love to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>messenger of ill
news,</hi> to any, but this is more tolerable and less af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightfull,
it being of a thing in all likelyhood so far off.
But whether this be not the natural and easy sense of
this passage in <hi>Daniel,</hi> I appeal to any unprejudiced
Reader. And it is no more than has been threatned
to <hi>old Rome</hi> (as well as it has happened to <hi>new Rome</hi>
already, namely to <hi>Constantinople)</hi> by men of their own
Church, that their City would be destroyed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the wickedness of their Clergy. So St. <hi>Bridget,</hi>
St. <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Sienne,</hi> Abbot <hi>Ioachim,</hi> and others,
have denounced against them, and some, of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overrun by the very <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But of all predictions of that kind, none seems
more considerable than that which <hi>Bartholomaeus
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59418:164"/>Georgivitz,</hi> a zealous Pilgrim of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
and one who was a slave for some thirteen years in
<hi>Turky,</hi> delivers in his <hi>Epitome, De moribus Turcarum,</hi>
Cap. 3. as a Prophecy of the <hi>Turks</hi> themselves, to this
sense. That after their Emperour the Grand Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
has taken the <hi>red Apple,</hi> if at the seventh year
of his Reign the Christian sword does not advance, he
shall rule unto the twelfth, but after the twelfth year
that he shall have won the red Apple, the Christian
sword shall appear and put the <hi>Turk</hi> to flight. Which
is an odd Prophecy amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the
more considerable in that it seems so impartial as to
declare against themselves. But what this <hi>Red Apple</hi>
should be, saith <hi>Georgivitz,</hi> is a question amongst the
learned of them, there being a various reading in the
Prophecy, either <hi>Kusul Almai</hi> which signifies a <hi>Red
Apple,</hi> or <hi>Vrum Papai,</hi> which may indigitate, says
he, the Patriarchacy of <hi>Constantinople, Vrum</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<hi>the Greek,</hi> forasmuch as all <hi>Greece</hi> was once
under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, otherwise <hi>Vrum</hi> would
more immediately signify <hi>Roman;</hi> but taken in that
other sense, <hi>Constantinople</hi> would be aimed at. But
it is so long since <hi>Constantinople</hi> was taken, that <hi>Vrum
Papai</hi> will either signify the seat of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi>
or else must be excluded for a spurious reading, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the Prophecy literally. And it may be it
was a Comment crept into the Text.</p>
               <p>For as all are agreed that by the <hi>red Apple</hi> is meant
some <hi>Imperial City,</hi> so the Red Hats of the Cardinals
and the Scarlet cloathing of the Papal Hierarchy
might easily invite the Commentatour to interpret
this <hi>Red Apple</hi> of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and if any <hi>Iew</hi> was
the Interpreter, as there are many amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi>
they understanding by <hi>Edom</hi> in the Scripture (which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59418:164"/>signifies <hi>Red)</hi> the City of <hi>Rome</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> Power,
it was hard for him to miss of that Interpretation.
And <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> notes, that the <hi>Iews</hi> by the
<hi>Idumaeans</hi> understand the <hi>Romans,</hi> in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon <hi>Isai. 21. 11. The Burden of</hi> Dumah (that is, of

was no need of this nicety, the Interpretation of this
<hi>Turkish</hi> Prophecy is discovered enough already. I will
onely referr the Reader to Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Book 5. Ch. 8.
where, by many examples he shows, that the <hi>Iews</hi>
by <hi>Edom</hi> understand <hi>Rome,</hi> and how <hi>R. D. Kimchi</hi>

               <p>But I think Interpreters are much mistaken when
they interpret the <hi>seven</hi> and <hi>twelve</hi> years not <hi>Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically</hi>
but <hi>Arithmetically.</hi> For, if there be any thing
in the Prophecy, I suspect this to be the meaning
thereof, That the <hi>Turk</hi> may take the City of <hi>Rome</hi>
(suppose within the space of the seventh Vial) being
so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hugely guilty of Idolatry and bloud, if she prevent
it not by timely Repentance. And if the Christian
sword advance not against him during the <hi>Septenary,</hi>
a Symbol of the reign of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for such was the

<hi>Turk</hi> to flight, that is, quite vanquish the <hi>Turkish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Power and turn them all Christians. And
these are those times which <hi>Cardan</hi> in an Astrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

fantastical as being Astrological, but the prediction
insinuated by some better kind of Genius (as the
Turkish Prophet haply might be inspired by some
secret Emissary from <hi>Palmoni,</hi> who has a right to
all Kingdomes though not possession yet of all)
is sober and true, as appears by the Holy Oracles
of Scripture.</p>

the time when the affairs of the <hi>Iews</hi> become very

<hi>And there shall be a time of trouble, such
as never was since there was a Nation even to

               </hi> As it is said <hi>Apoc.</hi> 16. 18. under the

deliverance, and from their particular delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the lake of fire or second death to the
General Salvation of all whose names are writ in the
Book of Life: As the sense is very coherent with
what follows in the next verse which contains
though something involutely and contractedly both
the first and second Resurrection, according as the
words are capable of a double Exposition.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>And many of them that sleep in the dust of the

to <hi>All,</hi> does plainly intimate the <hi>first</hi> Resurrection,
which is not the <hi>General</hi> Resurrection, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> onely, such as did actually
lose their lives for witnessing to the Truth, or did
without all reserve expose them for the same, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
did who was cast into the Lions den, and the
three Children into the fiery furnace, though they
were miraculously delivered. <hi>Some to everlasting

these awake to eternal life, and enjoy a blessed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality

               </gap> which you may render, <hi>But those others,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59418:166"/>
sort of people which the Prophecy points at
(whose condition begins at this first Resurrection
or about the commencing of the Blessed <hi>Millennium</hi>
or <hi>New Ierusalem</hi>-state) these shall be in perpetual
shame and contempt all along the time of the Blessed
<hi>Millennium</hi> or <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> and indeed even to the
end of the world: For these are that wretched Crew,
who are the foul spirits or unclean birds that haunt
the Ruins of <hi>Babylon,</hi> those Dogs, Sorcerers, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,
Murderers, Idolaters and Liars that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the Holy City. Which is a very shameful and
contemptible condition indeed. And according to
this sense of the words of this verse, it is plain the
<hi>first</hi> Resurrection mentioned in the Apocalypse is
pointed at.</p>
            <p>But now if by <hi>Many</hi> we do not understand a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
number in counterdistinction to <hi>All,</hi> but a vast
multitude as there will be certainly at the general
Resurrection (and the Critical Interpreters of the
Bible do not stick to affirm that <hi>Many</hi> sometimes sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<hi>All,</hi> so be they be but a great multitude) then
the Text will run naturally enough for the last and
<hi>General</hi> Resurrection when both good and bad shall
arise. And those words, <hi>Some to everlasting life, and
some to shame and everlasting contempt,</hi> will be a fit
distribution of those <hi>Many</hi> or <hi>All</hi> that are then said
to arise out of the dust of the Earth, the one part of
them being to be adjudged to a Blessed Immortality
in glorified bodies, the other to that shamefull, squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
forlorn and accursed condition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
Spirits, those horrid Hell-hounds with whom
they are to be sentenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d to everlasting fire, or the
Lake of fire and brimstone which is the second
death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:59418:167"/>
3. <hi>And they that be wise shall shine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Firmament,</hi> that is, They that be doci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and understand the ways of God and walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
accordingly shall shine as the brightness of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
as the bright azure Skie. <hi>And they that
turn many to righteousness, as the Stars for ever
and ever,</hi> that is, They that are not onely wise and
holy themselves but are instrumental in the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
true wisdome and holiness in others, shall shine
as the <hi>Stars,</hi> shall have a greater and more peculiar
and eminent glory than others. Which if it respect
the first sense of the foregoing verse, it denotes the
splendour and prosperity of the blessed <hi>Millennium,</hi> in
what honour and repute the Citizens of the new <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
especially the good Ministers, Pastors or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and godly Magistrates in what high esteem and
veneration they will live, in counterdistinction to that
wretched rabble that are excluded the holy City.</p>
            <p>But if it respect the second sense, it intimates the
different degrees of the glorified bodies of the Saints
in the Resurrection, which the Apostle sets off by
comparing one Star with another. <hi>For one Star
differeth from another Star in glory.</hi> But <hi>Daniel</hi> by
comparing the brightness of the Firmament with that
more vigorous lustre in the stars themselves, makes
a great difference betwixt that share of glory and
happiness which successfull <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Instructers</hi>
of the people in the ways of holiness, and faithfull
Magistrates shall have, and that which shall fall to
their lot whose activity hath reached no farther than
the concern of their own Souls.</p>
            <p>And thus we see this Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> to reach
to the very end of the World the general Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when the good shall be rewarded with that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marcescible
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59418:167"/>
Crown of eternal Glory, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sentenced to everlasting Fire. What follows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the obscurity, and Intelligibleness of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
in this last Vision and others that tend to
the same scope, <hi>when</hi> and <hi>by whom</hi> they are likely to
be understood, and <hi>by whom</hi> not understood.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>But thou O Daniel shut up the words and
seal the Book even to the time of the end.</hi> This
command to <hi>Daniel</hi> to seal the Book is a kind of
prediction that the Book will not be unsealed as to the
aforesaid Visions, till the <hi>Time of the End,</hi> that is,
till the last times or the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
for that is the fourth and last Monarchy. But
then in that time, <hi>Many shall run to and fro,</hi> that
is, be inquisitive and hunt after Truth. <hi>And know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
shall be increased,</hi> that is, They shall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
hunt in vain, but many shall find the Truth
and understand the coming of <hi>Christ</hi> by the help of
the Prophecies of this Book when he shall appear,
as also in the <hi>latter</hi> part of these <hi>last Times</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewise of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> Which is chiefly here aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at, when knowledge shall most of all abound, as it
has very much this last age or two.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Then I Daniel looked and behold! there stood
other two,</hi> Angels suppose in the shape of men, <hi>The
one on this side of the bank of the River, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> of <hi>Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekel</hi>
or <hi>Tigris,</hi> ch. 10. 4. <hi>And the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ther on that side of
the bank of the River.</hi> These two Angels signify two
Presidentiary Angels of two Kingdoms or Empires,
and St. <hi>Ierome</hi> makes them the Presidentiary Angels
of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Persia; Alcazar</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
But this is out of Inadvertency to what times this
part of the Prophecy reaches, which is to the times

<hi>Grecia,</hi> ch. 10. and also of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> so these two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are brought in as the Presidentiary Angels of
those Kingdoms or Empires that this part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
reaches to, namely the Presidentiary Angels
of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Mahometan</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>And one said to the man clothed in linen
which was upon the waters of the River, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> to
the man described ch. 10. 5. namely to <hi>Palmoni</hi> or

            <p>7. <hi>And I heard the man clothed in linen, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi>
him that is described ch. 10. 5. and whose descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is somewhat like that of Christ <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. V. 13,

set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the
earth. <hi>When he held up his right hand and his left
hand unto Heaven,</hi> As the Angel <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10. 5. is
said to lift up his hand to Heaven, which is the
posture of them that swear. <hi>And sware by him that
liveth for ever, That it shall be for a Time and
Times and half a Time:</hi> namely, Those more
marvellous things especially foretold of that <hi>King of
Pride</hi> ch. 11. v. 36, 37, 38. that they should conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
so long, about three Prophetical years and an
half, or forty two Prophetical months, as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse</hi>
expresseth it, which is the time also of the
<hi>little Horn with eyes,</hi> Dan. 7. 25. who is the
same with this King of Pride. <hi>And when he shall
have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy
people,</hi> that is, After the dispersion of the holy
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59418:168"/>
people the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be ended, which will be under
the first Thunder, about the sixth and seventh Vials.
<hi>All these things shall be finished.</hi> All these marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
things even to the first and second Resurrection
when there shall be no more time upon Earth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the oath of that Angel <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10. 6, 7.
which answers to this. For it is about the same thing,
as the Persons are the same, and therefore the time
the same. But the Oath of that <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Angel is.
<hi>That there shall be no more time saving in the days of
the voice of the seventh Angel when he shall sound and
the mystery of God be finished,</hi> that is, Upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
of the Time and Times and half a Time,
there shall be no more time on Earth or series of
things there, save what are contained within the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Trumpet or seven Thunders. Within the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
of that time and the Time and Times and
half a Time, all these things, as the Angel tells <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
shall be finished. So excellent a key is the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse</hi>
to this passage of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. <hi>And I heard but I understood not,</hi> namely
where to pitch these Time and Times and half a
Time, or where the <hi>latter part</hi> of the <hi>Times of the
End</hi> which is the Time of the fourth Monarchy, is
supposed to be. <hi>Then said I, O my Lord.</hi> He
speaks to the man clothed in linen upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with this reverence and respect as being the
same Angel described ch. 10. which I there shewed
to be Christ. <hi>What shall be the end of these things?</hi>

in those Times?</p>
            <p>9. <hi>And he said, Goe thy way Daniel, for the words
are closed up and sealed till the time of the End.</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:59418:169"/>
Which Time of the End here has a more restrict sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,

had said, The Vision touching these Time and
Times and half a Time is sealed up or concealed till
the being of those very Times, which are the <hi>Times

that is, shall persist in their gross Idolatries and sensual
lewdnesses and all manner of wickednesses, of Pride
and Avarice, and persecution of the pure Apostolick
Christians. <hi>And none of the wicked shall understand,</hi>
that is, None of the followers of Antichrist and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed

               </hi> Those that the fear of
God has made so, which is the beginning of all true
Wisdome. These will prove competent Judges of

are they that come to this Time, for they will have
the opportunity of not onely knowing Antichrist but
of suffering Martyrdome by opposing of him, and
witnessing against him in behalf of Christ and his

Impostures, Idolatries, and barbarous and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Pride and cruelty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Antichrist:

<hi>Daniel</hi> understood nothing by them; and therefore the

               <head>NOTES Upon VISION VI. Contin. Ver. II.</head>
               <p>This Prophecy of the Time
of the Revelation of Antichrist is so remarkable, that
it is worth our pains briefly here to consider the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
thereof. First then these Numbers 1290 days
and 1335 days cannot be understood of days so as
to be applied, the former of them to the time from
the pollution of the Temple by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi>
unto the Grant to the <hi>Iews,</hi> of living according to
their own laws, 2 <hi>Macc.</hi> 11. 27. the latter to the
time from the same Epocha to <hi>Antiochus</hi> his death,
as Mr <hi>Mede</hi> has unanswerably demonstrated in his
<hi>De Numeris Danielis,</hi> against <hi>Broughton</hi> and <hi>Iunius.</hi>
Whence it will necessarily follow that these 1290
and 1335 days are indeed so many Prophetical days,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59418:171"/>that is, <hi>years,</hi> as they are in this Book of <hi>Daniel</hi>
naturally to signify, unless some intimation be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the contrary, as I have noted above in due
place; and that this obvious Prophetical signification
of days suits very well with this Prophecy of the
<hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> and takes nothing from its clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and plainness, nay indeed there being here given
no intimation to the contrary (as there is in other
places of <hi>Daniel</hi> where days do not signify Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
days) it is no slight but rather demonstrative ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that they do signify Prophetical days here,
that is, that they are so many years.</p>
               <p>Whence it will follow that if we can but light
upon a fit Epocha to fix them to, the Time of the
strange wonders, or the time of the Time and
Times and half a Time (which the Antients univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
understood of the Reign of Antichrist) will
be discovered, and consequently that Antichrist is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come, according to the very suffrage of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And truly unless we will wilfully wink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, the Epocha to which these numbers are
to be fixt is evidently declared by the Angel,
namely, the Time that <hi>the daily Sacrifice shall
be taken away and the Abomination that maketh deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
be set up,</hi> which is spoke of in this very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> Ch. 11. 31. Where
touching <hi>Antiochus</hi> and his Ministers it is said, <hi>They
shall take away the daily Sacrifice, and shall place the
Abomination that maketh desolate.</hi> What can be more
assured, and more handsome, than that the <hi>Epocha</hi>
of the Number that points to the Times of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
should be fixt to the foulest Times of his
Type, <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:59418:171"/>But it is further to be noted that this Epocha, this
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Transgression that maketh desolate,</hi> as
it is called <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 13. is of some latitude, above six
years space. The bounds of which space <hi>Grotius</hi> seems
with judgment to define thus, upon <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 13. This
Time, says he, of about six years begins from the
first coming of <hi>Antiochus</hi> into <hi>Iudaea</hi> when the
Priesthood was prophaned, and it comprehends his
second coming the forbidding of the Jewish Rites,
the placing of the Idol in the Temple and the whole
Time of the intermission of the daily Sacrifice. And
upon Ch. 11. 28. This is the first coming, says he, of
<hi>Antiochus</hi> into <hi>Iudaea,</hi> when he disposed as he pleased
of the High Priesthood. Whence I think we may
safely set those bounds of Prophanation or the <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
that maketh desolate,</hi> so as to place their <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>
in the 141. year of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> and their
<hi>ending</hi> in the 148. For in the former year <hi>Menelaus</hi> by
large bribes and much flattery obtained the High
Priestood of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and thrust out <hi>Iason. Quod
erat proximum initium miseriarum Iudaeae sub Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
Epiphane,</hi> says <hi>Thomas Lydiat.</hi> And in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> died, and <hi>Antiochus Eupator</hi>
his successour granted an <gap reason="foreign">

liberty of living acording to their own laws, <hi>viz.</hi>
according to the Holy Covenant or Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore this <hi>Epocha</hi> being so large as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the space of above six years, it is the less
likely that the ending pointed precisely to a year,
when this discovery of the times of Antichrist should
be. But both the Numbers consisting absolutely and
compleatly of <hi>Quindenaries</hi> or <hi>Indictions,</hi> that this was
not onely an intimation that the Numbers reached
into the Times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59418:172"/>of their computation by Indictions, but that
we may also compute this distance of Time by <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denaries</hi>
or <hi>Indictions.</hi> As if he should say, After 86
Quindenaries, or 89 Quindenaries, or before the 87th
or the 90th be expired, such things touching Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
will be clearly understood, and it will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
and plain that those be the Times of Antichrist,
and that we are not then to expect an Antichrist to
come, but may be sure he is come already; And if it
were but thus, it were sufficient.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> taking the middle of the Time of the
<hi>Transgression that maketh desolate,</hi> which is the year
before Christ 167. the Time of the first Number will
expire, says he, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1123, the Time of the latter
<hi>A. D.</hi> 1168. But forasmuch as there is a latitude in
the Epocha, we may begin the reckoning from every
year thereof, and therefore beginning at the first of
the six, the first Number will expire <hi>A. D.</hi> 1120. in
which very year was there a Book published which
did plainly declare the Apostasy of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and that the Pope was Antichrist. And the
very Date thereof is set in the Title page <hi>A. D.</hi> 1120.
as you may see in <hi>Paul Perrin</hi>'s History of the
<hi>Waldenses.</hi> This is very accurate, though I confess I
think it sufficient that this happened in the last <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denarie</hi>
of the first Number. For neither were the
2300 Evening-mornings intended to predict to a
<hi>day,</hi> but to be collected into <hi>years,</hi> as these Numbers
into <hi>Indictions</hi> or <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>indenaries.</hi> This Book with
this date of <hi>A. D.</hi> 1120. by <hi>Paul Perrin</hi> is reckoned
among the Books of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> of whose holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and sincere Christianity I cannot but recite that
Testimony which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has noted out of <hi>Bern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ardus,</hi>
who in the midst of his inveighing against
t<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59418:172"/>hem for being enemies to the Pope, yet he could not
but allow them this character. Whom notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
says he, if you ask them concerning their faith,
there is nothing more Christian, if you consider their
conversation, there is nothing more irreprehensible,
and they make good their words by their deeds. Who
would know more of these excellent Christians, let
him read <hi>Paul Perrin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus admirably is the Prophetick purpose of
this first Number fulfilled in the publishing of that
Book of the <hi>Waldenses A. D.</hi> 1120. and within the
last <hi>Quindenarie</hi> of that Number. And it is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
how in that Age, yea less than twenty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the publishing of that Book, all the world was in
expectation of Antichrist's being revealed, insomuch
that Pope <hi>Pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>hal</hi> himself, when he intended for <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
Cisalpina,</hi> stopt his journey at <hi>Florence,</hi> being
struck with the greatness of the rumour, which was
understood of such an Antichrist as the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
fancied to themselves, and the Romanists would
seem to believe. Which circumstance was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Providence, that it might be more remarkably
imprest upon the capable, who it is that is indeed
the true Antichrist, to whom that Title so often used
by the Fathers, does of right belong.</p>
               <p>But now for the other Number, the fulfilling of its<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Prophetical Indication is also admirable. For not
precisely tying our selves to the year 1168. by taking
the middle of the six years of the <hi>Transgression that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
maketh desolate</hi> for our Epocha; betwixt the year
1160. and 1170, and if another <hi>Quindenarie</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to it, it would break no squares, provided that
things happen within that <hi>Quindenarie,</hi> upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of Antichrist innumerable multitudes of men
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59418:173"/>were awakened as with a Trumpet into the ancient
Apostolick Faith, whom they called <hi>Waldenses</hi> &amp; <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses</hi>
and by other names, but they called themselves
<hi>Apostolici,</hi> who stood so s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>outly to the Faith, that no
persecutions which presently ensued could change
their minds or make them alter their Profession,
though about ten hundred thousand of them, and
that in <hi>France</hi> alone, were put to death, if <hi>Paulus Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionius</hi>
computes right in his History of them. And
these are that faithful Martyr <hi>Antipas</hi> who was slain
in the lofty <hi>Pergamus,</hi> where Satans seat is, as Christ
complains in his Epistle to the Church there. And
they having the priviledge of Martyrs, who are
faithful unto death, it is said here in <hi>Daniel, Blessed
is he that waiteth and cometh to the 1335 days.</hi> But
this I have noted already in my <hi>Exposition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will only add one note more, what a childish thing
it is or worse, to have recourse to the ancient Fathers
for a certain and distinct knowledge of these Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>Daniel</hi> (and there is the same reason for those
of the Apocalypse) whenas it is thus expresly signified
in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that these mysteries touching Antichrist
would be sealed up till the time of the end, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
till the expiration of the 1290 years from
the Profanation of the Temple by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> i.e. till
about 1100 and odd years after Christ.</p>
               <p>That the Times of Antichrist were prefigured and
foretold by these and such like Prophecies, so far the
ancient Fathers were right, and so far their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
stands for us; but <hi>when</hi> those Times would be,
or <hi>who</hi> would prove that Antichrist, that was left
for the faithful to find out by the ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>stance of Gods
Spirit, when the Time of that Revelation by Gods
appointment was come, which was about the Time
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59418:173"/>of the beginning of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to deny the People of God the assistance of his
Spirit, to keep up the credit of the Fathers and the
Authority of the Church, as if we could be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of nothing unless they tell us it is so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the very
dregs of Antichristianism, and the very Pit of slime
and spawn out of which Antichrist did arise, and
though men do not so easily observe it, a bidding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
to our very Baptism, whereby we are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
Which is not to make a mere drie profession of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unity
of the Godhead, but to remind us what a lively
faith we ought to have in the Son, for his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

the Spirit from his Father, according to promise, to
sanctify us, to strengthen us, and illuminate us, and
to carry us on in the process of real Regeneration, in
which we shall attain to <hi>eyes</hi> as well as <hi>heart, hands</hi>

<hi>Christ</hi> from <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and <hi>true</hi> Prophets from

in hand, (in which odd conceit of his he forsakes the

And it agrees best with what follows, <hi>and shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the whole Earth,</hi> (which must be understood
in such a sense as Earth was before) <hi>and shall tread it
down and break it in pieces.</hi> Which it could not be said
to do, unless it were so great a Kingdome as is here
intimated. Now it is manifest that the Kingdome of
the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae</hi> * was neither greater,
more excellent, nor a more victorious Kingdome than
any of the three preceeding, namely, the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Persian</hi> and that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, from
whose Kingdome they would make this of the <hi>Lagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae</hi>

cannot be this Fourth.</p>

is indeed the very Kingdom of Christ, as Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ever have expounded it. Which is a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to <hi>Grotius</hi> his Dream, That the fourth
Beast with Iron Teeth and the Iron legs of the Image

               <p>* For <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> was dead almost two

the Doctrine of the Kingdome, or had any Disciples

which passage I doubt not but that phrase <hi>[The

Son of man mentioned <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13. is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the <hi>Messias)</hi> Wherefore it is impossible that
the Kingdome of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> should
be the fourth Kingdom.</p>
               <p>5. But here <hi>Grotius,</hi> contrary to his judgment
when he wrote upon <hi>Matthew,</hi> has found a device
which is scarce to be uttered without horrour and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
So that I am infinitely amazed, that a
man otherwise so learned and laudable, (as he speaks
of <hi>Porphyrius)</hi> should be mis-led into so bad an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
<hi>The Son of man coming in the Clouds of
Heaven,</hi> according to him, is <hi>Populus Romanus nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
intra se habens Regem.</hi> When our Saviour Christ
intimated to the High Priest, that he was that <hi>Son of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59418:177"/>
man that should come in the Clouds of Heaven,</hi> it
seem'd so high an Arrogation, that he rent his
clothes and said <hi>he had spoken Blasphemy.</hi> And
truly I think that neither Jew nor Christian can
well acquit <hi>Grotius</hi> of that crime, who attributes
that which is the peculiar character of the <hi>Messias</hi> to
a Prophane and Pagan people, and that forsooth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had no King, as if they were ever the
better for that. But they had Kings at first, and
both in the Infancy of their Empire and afterwards
they had a Supreme Power so great and Imperial,
as may excuse them from the least shew of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
They had always over them a Sovereignty,
so that they could not be deemed the Son of man
for any such private condition. For the <hi>Summa Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas</hi>
is the <hi>Summa Potestas</hi> under what name or
form soever, and of the same real grandeur. Besides
that, they were a most glorious and victorious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
before <hi>Antiochus</hi> his time. So that it is a very
dilute and sapless conceit of <hi>Grotius</hi> to apply the
Phrase of the <hi>Son of man</hi> to them for any inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableness
in them or obscurity: For they were not
so in the times of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Again, The Kingdom of the <hi>Son of man</hi> and
the <hi>Stone cut out without hands</hi> are all one, both in
truth and according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his own concession.
But <hi>this Stone,</hi> is Christ and his Kingdome, as being
Heavenly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a thing erected not by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
power, but by the power and Spirit of God.
That this is the meaning of [without hands] is the
general vote of Interpreters, S. <hi>Ierom, Irenaeus, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,
Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin, Theodoret,</hi> and several
others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:59418:178"/>
Where think you does <hi>Grotius</hi> take shelter now?
Why, This <hi>Figure</hi> which is so appropriate to Christ,
and mentioned of him so often in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
This <hi>Stone</hi> must be cast away as if it were
neither precious nor a Corner-stone, and be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again on a Pagan people the <hi>Romans.</hi> For so <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
does not stick to profess, <hi>Idem Lapis &amp; Filius
hominis;</hi> and he made the Son of man before the
people of <hi>Rome.</hi> But can a man believe that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
or success of that people was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
a thing brought to pass by the special power and
Spirit of God, and not <hi>more humano,</hi> according to
the usual course of the World, and that not of the
best kind, their beginnings being helped on by a
rabble of Ruffians and Robbers?</p>
               <p>7. No, but that is not <hi>Grotius</hi> his gloss, you will

which there is nothing sound nor solid. For was
this Roman Army any thing more <hi>suae spontis</hi> in,
that they had not a Kingly Government at <hi>Rome?</hi>
That supreme Power of <hi>Consuls</hi> and <hi>Senatours</hi> was as
directive and coactive as if it had been <hi>Regal.</hi> So
that the motion of this Army was never the more
spontaneous for this. Again, The Stone cut from
the Mountain without hands, implies that it was then
spontaneously divided from the Mountain, when it
is said to be cut thence: But when the <hi>Romans</hi> first
issued from Mount <hi>Palatine,</hi> yea so soon as they
were <hi>Populus Romanus, Regal</hi> Government was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, it being the first Government of this

                  </gap>eople, and therefore they were not then <hi>Populus suae
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59418:178"/>
spontis,</hi> according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his own conceit, so that
he cannot bring both ends together. And lastly, To
interpret <hi>Mountain</hi> here in a litteral sense, is unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
done, and not according to the analogy of the
Prophetick Style, nor the very intimation of the
present Text, which says the <hi>little Stone</hi> became a
<hi>great Mountain</hi> it self, and filled the whole Earth.
Wherefore this Mountain signifying not litterally but
politically, there is no question but the other does so
too, and that the Stone is in some sense homogeneal
to this rocky Mountain.</p>
               <p>Whence the sense is plainly this: That out of the
great Mountain, that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, there
should be a people raised, not by <hi>human</hi> power or
policy, but by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and the preaching
of the Gospel by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> which
should be a peculiar people to him, and becom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the
Subjects of his Kingdome; that is to say, That the
Church of Christ should be cut out of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire without human help. This is a most easy
and undistorted sense, and against which there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made the least exception.</p>
               <p>8. Fourthly, which I have already intimated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
The <hi>Ten Horns</hi> of the Fourth Beast with Iron
Teeth, and the <hi>Ten Toes</hi> of the Iron Legs of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
signify the same thing. Wherefore it is plain,
sith the Ten Toes imply a Coexistence of the Ten
Horns, by reason of the coordination of their Site,
that there must be Ten Kings together in the Fourth
Kingdome. But in the Kingdome of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi>
and <hi>Lagidae</hi> there were not Ten Kings together all at
once. Therefore that Kingdome is not the Fourth.</p>
               <p>9. Fifthly, <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> part of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> is said to ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59418:179"/>
up in the latter time of the Kingdome of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
of <hi>Alexander, Dan.</hi> 8. 22, 23. Wherefore
this Kingdome of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
near two thousand years ago. But the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Fourth Beast reaches even to the day of
Judgment. <hi>Dan. 7. 9, 10. And I beheld till the Thrones
were cast down, and the Antient of days did sit—His
Throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from
before him, thousand thousands ministred unto him;
and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;
* the Iudgment was set, and the Books were opened,</hi>
&amp;c. That this is the description of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the general opinion of both Christians and
Jews, and answers exactly to the lake of Fire and
the opening of the Books, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. which <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
himself does interpret of the last day. Whence
we may safely conclude that the Kingdome of the
<hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> is not the Fourth Kingdome, as
having ceased so long before that time, though we
understood the day of Judgment in the sense of the
Rabbins <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> According to which the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>[I beheld till the Thrones were set—and the
Books were opened]</hi> is this, that the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi>
had a prospect even to the utmost end of that great
day. But he begins more particularly at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that day in the eleventh verse. But this I
have onely noted by the by.</p>
               <p>10. Sixthly and lastly, <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Kingdome and
that of his Successours is all one Kingdome: But that
of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s is the third according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his
own concession. Now that that of his Successours
(of which Line are the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae)</hi> is
one Kingdome with that of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s, is evident
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59418:179"/>
out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Ch. 8. 21. <hi>The rough Goat is the
King of</hi> Graecia, <hi>and the great Horn that is bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

his eyes, is the first King. Now that being broken
whereas Four stood up for it, Four Kingdomes shall
stand up out of the Nation, but not in his Power.</hi> This is
one plain proof that the Kingdome of <hi>Alexander</hi> and
his Successours is all one Kingdome. For he calls <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi>
the first King, which necessarily implies that
his Successours are the second, and that therefore they
all belong to one and the same Kingdome. Nay he
says plainly, that these Four Horns stand up <hi>for</hi> that
great one, that is, <hi>in his stead.</hi> What is this but to
succeed in place of him, as the Heads of one and the
same Empire? For no new Beast is said to succeed this
Beast, but the Horns the Horn. And then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of them and saying, But not in his power,
farther intimates a cognation and succession of one
Line, and that he does no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> speak of the Heads of two
different Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>Which appears farther from vers. 8. <hi>Therefore the
Goat waxed very great, and when he was strong, the
great Horn was broken, and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> it came up four no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ones toward the four winds of Heaven.</hi> But where
should these come up, but on that Head that had
lost this great Horn, which is compensated with four
lesser ones, * though in their kind notable? For it is very
incongruous and extravagant to fansy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them to come
up in any other. And surely if they had belonged to
any other Beast, that Beast would not fail to have been
named. Wherefore they must either grow out of this
Goat's Head, or no where, unless out of the ground;
which is ridiculous. And therefore it is plain, that
<hi>Alexanders</hi> Kingdome and that of his Successors is but
one Kingdome. For that Goat is but one and the same
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59418:180"/>
Goat under the Succession of this variety of Horns.</p>
               <p>11. And yet there is still greater evidence of this
truth from Ch. 7. 6. <hi>After which I beheld and lo, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like a Leopard, which had upon the back of it
four Wings of a fowl, the beast had also four Heads,
and Domini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n was given unto it.</hi> That the four Heads
of this Beast are the four Successours of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
* namely, <hi>Perdicca, Seleucus, Ptolemaeus, Meleager,
Grotius</hi> himself does frankly confess. The Wings
therefore denote the four Kingdomes <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
Empire was divided into, after his decease; which
is still lookt upon as one Beast notwithstanding, as
the <hi>Roman</hi> is with its division into ten Kingdomes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by ten Horns, or into <hi>Oriental</hi> and <hi>Occidental,</hi>
figured by the two Wings of an Eagle.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Grotius,</hi> if he would speak out, would make
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Beast, as he has <hi>Domitian</hi> and others
in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> against all the Laws of Prophetick

                     </gap>der</hi> is the first Head or great Horn
of this Beast, not the Body of it, that he may be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour

these were not Heads nor Horns, before <hi>he</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s dead.
<hi>Alexander</hi> therefore is the first of the Succession of
the Heads or Horns of this Beast, not the Beast it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:59418:180"/>
But to come up closer to our business: I say, it is
very manifest from thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>

                  </gap>our Heads and four Wings
that this Leopard is said to have, that the Third King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
takes into it the four first Successours of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
Nothing can be more plain than this from the
very Text. For the Leopard is described in the third
place, and immediately after him the Fourth Beast
is mentioned, and called the Fourth, v. 7. Wherefore
this four-headed Leopard is plainly the Third Beast.
But now that the Succession of these four Heads even
to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> is the Succession of one and
the same Kingdome, is plain from Ch. 8. 22. <hi>Now
that being broken,</hi> (namely the great Horn) <hi>whereas
Four stood up for it, Four Kingdomes shall stand up
out of the Nation, but not in his power. And in the
latter time of their Kingdome</hi> (the Original has it,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which the Seventy render <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which is the very same
with our English, and there is no doubt of the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation)
<hi>a King of fierce countenance—shall stand up.</hi>
Which <hi>Grotius</hi> and every one acknowledges to be
<hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence it is evident that the whole Succession of
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s Captains from the first four inclusively
even to <hi>Antiochus</hi> his time, is one Succession and one
Kingdome. For he calls the times of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the
last times of their Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is plain, seeing that the Kingdome
of <hi>Alexander</hi> is one and the same with the Kingdome
of the four Captains (for that is the Third Kingdome)
and the Kingdome of the four Captains the same with
their Succession even to <hi>Antiochus</hi> his time; that
the whole Succession from <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Antiochus</hi>
is one Succession and one Kingdome. If this be not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59418:181"/>
demonstratively true, there is no demonstration in
Mathematicks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if this be true, the Kingdome of
the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> are not the Fourth King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but the Kingdome of the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

as all sober men have hitherto held.</p>
               <p>12. Which we being so firmly assured of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we shall
easily know where to seek for this <hi>little Horn</hi> that
is said to <hi>change times and laws.</hi> For where can we
find it but amongst those many Horns in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Kingdome or Empire? not in the <hi>Greek,</hi> to which
<hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> appertains. And we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
plainly shewn * that the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Beast
with seven Heads and ten Horns is this Roman King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and that this Beast once healed, or in such a
condition, that it may be said of him that he is <hi>the
Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> (which is when
he is become <hi>Pagano Christian</hi>) is this Empire actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
divided into ten Kingdomes, and that together
with this Division the Empire began to relapse gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
into Idolatry by the Agency and Guidance
of the <hi>Two-horned</hi> Beast or the <hi>Whore,</hi> whom I hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
also shewed to be Synchronal to the healed Beast, or
the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. But the Beast restored or healed, his duration
is 42 <hi>months,</hi> which is 1260 <hi>days,</hi> or a <hi>Time and Times
and half a Time.</hi> For the abode of the Woman in
the Wilderness is indifferently expressed by either of
these latter; and the first and the second are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the Vision of the <hi>Outward Court</hi> and the
<hi>Two Witnesses.</hi> Wherefore 42 <hi>months</hi> and a <hi>Time
and Times and half a Time,</hi> being the same with 1260
<hi>days,</hi> they are the same one with another. But this
<hi>little Horn</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> we speak of, his Reign is also
set out by a <hi>Time and Times and half a Time:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59418:181"/>
it is of the same duration with the <hi>Whore</hi> or
<hi>Two-horned</hi> Beast, which is Synchronal to the Beast
restored, whose continuance is 42. months.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is a strong suspicion that there is a
Coincidence at least of time, if not of affairs, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of natures (if not Identity of some) betwixt
this <hi>little Horn</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> and those three Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
the <hi>restored Beast,</hi> the <hi>Whore</hi> and the <hi>Two-horned
Beast.</hi> For that expression <hi>Dan. 7. 24. And another shall
rise after them,</hi> does not at all hinder, since the Seventy
translate <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>behind them,</hi> * it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
order of situation as well as of time. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
placed behind is the most convenient posture for
such an exploit as is attributed to this Horn, which is
said to throw down or humble three Kings: which
is more by treachery and craft than open force.</p>
               <p>14. Now from this equality of time it will also
follow * that the duration of this little Horn is 1260
years by the last Confectary of our joynt Exposition.
Which again shews how impossible it is this Horn
should be <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> To which you may
add that it is said to be <hi>different</hi> from the rest of the
Horns, in the explication of them. * <hi>And the ten
Horns out of this Kingdome</hi> (that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as has been demonstrated) <hi>are ten Kings that
shall arise; and another shall rise <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> behind
them, and he shall be</hi> diverse <hi>from the rest, and he
shall subdue three Kings.</hi> Now I demand what one of
the ten Kings or Kingdomes is so different from all
the rest, unless it be an <hi>Ecclesiastical Kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore the <hi>Coincidence</hi> of <hi>time</hi> with the Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>Christian
Empire, and the <hi>long continuance,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the <hi>difference</hi> of this Kingdome from the other
ten, is more than a strong suspicion that it is part of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59418:182"/>
the succession of a Kingdome Ecclesiastick, which is
necessarily to run along with the Empire professing
Christianity. But if the question be whether this part
of this Ecclesiastick Kingdome be the uncorrupted
Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> or the Reign of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not difficult. For that it is not the Kingdome
of Christ, is plain, in that Christ is said to come to
burn and consume it. Whence it is manifest that the
Church has not been out in their Conjecture in deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this <hi>little Horn</hi> to be <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and therefore
say I, the same with the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast and the
<hi>Whore,</hi> who is plainly Isochronal, and I doubt not
but Synchronal to this <hi>little Horn,</hi> and is adjudged
to be burnt in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> as this little Horn is
here in <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15. To speak briefly therefore, This little Horn is
the Idolatrizing Clergy of the Empire, but more
chiefly and particularly that great and notorious part
thereof under the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who has been a
more than ordinary stickler for both the obtaining
this degenerate Ecclesiastick Empire in the Roman
Empire, and in lapsing and keeping down the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in Superstition and Idolatry; and therefore is
rightly said to be an Horn growing out of this Beast,
the Symbol (Beast) it self according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his
own Confession, intimating Idolatry.</p>
               <p>16. And if exquisite fitness of Application will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us of the right sense of a Prophecy, we cannot
fail in this, examining every character of this <hi>little
Horn.</hi> For as it is <hi>little,</hi> so is the Original of the
Popes mean and obscure, and their Secular Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality
small in comparison of those Princes they have
contested with. Again, As this Horn had the <hi>Eyes
of a man,</hi> so it is well known that for politick quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sightedness
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59418:182"/>
there has not been any Body of men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy; insomuch that it is
Proverbial to say, That the Roman Religion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a mere trick of Policy to increase and
keep up the honour, power, and wealth of the Pope
and his Clergy. See Sir <hi>Edwyn Sandys</hi> his <hi>Speculum
Europae,</hi> and you shall find this part of the Prophecy
fulfilled to admiration, and that it is not for nothing
that this <hi>little Horn</hi> is said to have <hi>the Eyes of a man</hi>
in it, which is said of no Horn in all the Prophecies
besides this. Thirdly, As this Horn is said to have
<hi>a mouth speaking great things,</hi> whether you mean
thereby boasting of its own Sovereignty or Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
it is well known that from this Horn are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
such words as imply the Pope greater than all
Princes and Emperours, nay, that he is not onely
said to be <hi>Infallible</hi> * but styled <hi>God,</hi> and declared
worthy of Divine Worship. Fourthly, For the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and subduing three Kings, which this Horn is
foretold to doe, is it not long since performed by the
Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his usage of <hi>Leo Isaurus,</hi> in his rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Kingdome of the <hi>Lombards</hi> to get to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the Exarchate of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> And in tormenting
and disquieting <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth and his Successours
with his Thunder-claps and mischievous Political
Plots, till he wrested from them all their Right and
Jurisdiction in <hi>Italy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. Fifthly, and to come nearer to our purpose
in hand; Whereas it is said that <hi>he shall speak great
words against the most High, and shall wear out the
Saints of the most High, and think to change Times
and Laws; and they shall be given into his hand for
a Time and Times and half a Time:</hi> I say, This Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Clergy has bid fair towards the fulfilling this
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59418:183"/>
Period of times already; the Degeneracy of the
Church beginning about four hundred years after
Christ, and (which is more considerable) they
having received so notorious a Check in the Decur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this <hi>Half-Time,</hi> which is elsewhere called a
<hi>Half-Day,</hi> in which his swaggering is pretty well
diminished and chastised. Sixthly, And for his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out, and consuming the Saints of the most High,
he has done it even more bloudily and cruelly than
the very Pagans on the Primitive Christians; which is
the most furious Opposition against the <hi>Regality</hi> of
Christ that can be imagined, thus to waste and destroy
his <hi>true</hi> Subjects. Seventhly, And for his speaking
<hi>great words against the most High,</hi> that is, against
the Divine Sovereignty, is it not plainly done in the
Pope's pretences of having power to dispense with or
lay aside the Laws and Injunctions of Christ, of which
we have given several Instances in our <hi>Idea of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism,</hi>
and such as are notoriously well known
to appertain to that Church? Besides that he is <hi>Reus
laesae Divinae Majestatis</hi> in appointing Religious
worship to his canonized Saints, which is an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due to God alone. Lastly, In that he is said to
<hi>change Times and Laws;</hi> what innumerable Institutes
are there of the Pope's injoyning, of which may be
truly said what our Saviour told the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>From the beginning it
was not so?</hi> And what is this therefore but to <hi>change
Times and Laws,</hi> and in many of them in a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Opposition to the Laws of God and Christ, as I
have already noted in its place?</p>
               <p>Whence we see plainly that this <hi>Antichristian Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
against the <hi>Regal</hi> Office of Christ, is very
expresly foretold in this Vision of the <hi>little Horn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

which rose up with the ten Horns in the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,

Empire within the <hi>Civil,</hi> in opposition to the true
Empire or Kingdome of Christ, and in defeatment
of his Power and Laws in the Church; nay, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to those Immutable Laws of the Eternal

one or both, are far enough removed from the times
of the Kingdome of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the fourth Kingdome necessarily is understood,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9, 10. to reach at least to the first point of that
time of Judgment. Whence it is impossible for the
Kingdome of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> to be the
fourth Kingdome. This is in short the undeniable force
of the argument.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 10. <hi>Though in their kind notable.]</hi> I have
observed in my <hi>Exposition,</hi> That the four notable
Horns that came up are called notable in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of several other Horns, <hi>viz.</hi> Commanders, that
succeeded <hi>Alexander</hi> in several lesser Principalities
or Satrapies. But those notable ones who they
are, we shall have occasion to note in the next
Section.</p>

Where why he should say [succreverant] and not
[succreverunt] I know not, unless he would insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
that they had grown upon him so as to overrule
him in his life time. Which yet is grosly false and
inconsistent with the magnanimity of <hi>Alexanders</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as well as with History. It makes me suspect he
would insinuate some such thing, because no Historian
reckons <hi>Meleager</hi> as one of those notable four Horns
or Heads that succeeded the great Horn after its fall,
he living himself not many days after <hi>Alexander</hi> and
no notice being taken of his Succession. But those
four notable Successours of <hi>Alexander</hi> Historians take
notice of as I have related in my Exposition. And
that these four Horns must be understood to arise after
the fall of the first great one, <hi>Alexander</hi> himself, is plain
from the Text. But the <hi>four Heads</hi> and the <hi>four Horns</hi>
are all one according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
and the four Heads are the Heads of the
Leopard the third Beast or Greek Empire, and what
can possibly hinder then but that their Successours
also, <hi>viz.</hi> the Successours of <hi>Ptolemaeus Lagi</hi> and of
<hi>Seleucus</hi> be Heads likewise of the Greek Empire? But
what a blinding thing is prejudice that <hi>Grotius</hi> could
not see so clear a consequence! But these things I have

De <hi>Antichristo,</hi> Lib. 4. Cap. 10. Where he proves that
in the Gloss of the Canon Law the Pope is called
<hi>Dominus Deus noster,</hi> and that there is no shuffling it
off by saying it was an Erratum of the Press (which is
incredible that by mistake they should intersert that
word [Deus]) but that rather the omission of it in
whatsoever Impression it was left out, was an Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

had it, saith he, and some few had left it out,
the most accurate Edition of all caused by Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
the thirteenth, who appointed certain skilfull
men to revise the Gloss of the Canon Law, had [Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus

of God and his receiving adoration sitting on
the Altar which is the proper Throne of the body of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59418:185"/>Christ, to say nothing how it is also the place where
they set their Images to be worshipped, suits well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
and are an Indication that a kind of Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or Religious worship, call it which you will, is
given to the Pope. See Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> in the place

after the Rising of the Witnesses, contrary
to the Opinion of Mr. Mede, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>I Am I confess abundantly convinced in my own
Judgment that persons of learning and parts and
sobriety of life, that have piously applied themselves
to the understanding and interpreting the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
especially the Prophetical parts thereof, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> have a right,
as to be read and duely considered by those that come
after and put themselves upon the same Province; so
also not to be contradicted or deviated from, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
plain and palpable reason. Nor indeed do I think
it safe for any one or lawfull, out of mere curiosity of
knowing hard and obscure things, as they may seem
to many, to adventure upon such a Province, but
simply either the better to inform himself of his own
duty, or to serve the Publick, and having this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
with fear and reverence as in the sight of God
to enter upon his charge, and accordingly to quit
himself therein.</p>
               <p>Whenas yet notwithstanding such is the vanity
and frailty of human nature that upon mere Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
many times men rush upon such things, neither
considering the sacredness and difficulty of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor duly weighing what God has imparted to
others before them, but out of levity of mind, if
they have excogitated or hit upon any specious thing
different from other Interpreters, out of levity of mind,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59418:186"/>
I say, and a self-favouring conceitedness they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fancie it as well more excellent and more true as
different. Others out of a fondness towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
presume they have a more peculiar gift that
way, and by strong prepossession of their private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
deeply impressed upon their melancholy Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
render themselves incorrigible and uncapable
of the most evident and most solid information from
others. And others given up to a Fanatick Spirit do
not stick to presume themselves in an extraordinary
manner inspired, and upon that account heed not
what others have writ before them, and so comparing
themselves onely with themselves, prove themselves,
as the Apostle speaks, unwise. And lastly there are
those who to serve an Interest have quite left the
rode of other Expositours (who had according to
their measure of light expounded things <hi>bonâ fide)</hi>
and have most lamentably and shamefully perverted
and distorted the genuine meaning of both <hi>Daniel</hi>
and the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> the former in the most concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
parts thereof, and the latter in a manner all
over.</p>
               <p>But I can appeal to God and my own conscience,
that I have framed no interpretations to serve any
Interest but that of Truth, and the Church or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ. Nor have I out of any curiosity
of prying into hard and obscure things medled with
either the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> or <hi>Daniel,</hi> but merely for more
full satisfaction in the great Controversy betwixt us
and the Papists, who leave no stone unmoved to
pervert Souls, and to bring them over to their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Church. Wherefore for my own more full
satisfaction, and for the service of the true Church of
Christ, and for nothing else that I know of, have I
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59418:187"/>
taken these pains to make a <hi>continued Exposition</hi> of
all the Prophecies as well of <hi>Daniel</hi> as the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein if I have deviated from the footsteps of
others, amongst whom I account Mr. <hi>Ioseph Mede</hi>
absolutely the chief (and than whom I conceive no
writer of that kind has deserved better of the Church
of God) yet I can aver it with all faithfulness that
it is not out of a desire of seeming to have found out
something better than his, that I have dissented from
him, but because I am driven thereto by meer force
of Reason. Otherwise having no design but assisting
the Truth, I hold it absolutely my duty not to deviate
or vary from such pious and able Interpreters where
I find their interpretation sound; Truth being thus
the better recommended by the witness of two or
many than if I stood single by my self. And therefore
I always covet if I can find them, to have companions
if they be companions in the Truth, otherwise

Trumpet after the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> and
interpret the <hi>three Days and an half,</hi> wherein the
Witnesses lie slain, of <hi>three Times and an half,</hi> I hope
I shall make clear by the Account following.</p>
               <p>First then we are to take notice of the Method,
or Genius if you will, of both <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,</hi>
that after two Prophecies suppose of the same
extent of time and of the same things which are of
a more large and reaching compass, there comes a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59418:187"/>
Prophecy or Vision concerning onely part of that
larger compass of time wherein some part onely of
the foregoing Vision is more copiously enlarged upon.
As for example, After the Vision of the <hi>Statue of four
Metals</hi> and that other of the <hi>four Beasts,</hi> both which Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
reach from the beginnnig of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to the ending of the <hi>Roman,</hi> or speaking in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptick</hi>
phrase to the end of the <hi>last Vial,</hi> there comes
next the Vision of the <hi>Ram</hi> and <hi>He-Goat</hi> which takes
in onely the time of the <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Greek Empire,</hi>
and enlarges on the affairs of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and especially on the times of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi>
So likewise in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> in the <hi>Opened Book-Prophecies,</hi>
after the two Visions or Prophecies of
the same extent of time, <hi>viz.</hi> from the beginning of
the Church to the end of the seventh or <hi>last Vial</hi>
(the former of which two Prophecies is contained
in the Eleventh Chapter, the latter in the three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Chapters, namely, the twelfth, thirteenth
and fourteenth) there follows then the Vision of the
<hi>seven Vials</hi> which run over but part of that extent
of time which each of the two foregoing Prophecies
do comprise.</p>
               <p>Now as there are three conspicuous <hi>Ioynts</hi> of a
more universal consideration in the compages of the
two abovesaid Prophecies in <hi>Daniel,</hi> namely, those
in which are held the Ending of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
and Beginning of the <hi>Pesiran,</hi> the Ending of
the <hi>Persian</hi> and the Beginning of the <hi>Grecian,</hi> the
Ending of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and the Beginning of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
so there are two manifest <hi>Ioynts</hi> likewise and of
a more universal consideration in the two abovesaid
Prophecies in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> (the one contained in
the eleventh Chapter and the other in the twelfth,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59418:188"/>
thirteenth and fourteenth) namely, the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as in a <hi>communis terminus,</hi> the end of the <hi>Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral</hi>
Ages of the Church and the beginning of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>symmetral</hi>
or of the <hi>Apostasy</hi> are held together, and the
Time wherein the Ending of the <hi>Entireness</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie</hi>
and the Beginning of the <hi>Restitution</hi> or first
<hi>Emergency</hi> out of it, are held together. The former
<hi>Ioynt</hi> is the Time wherein the Ending of the <hi>Sixth
Seal</hi> and Beginning of the <hi>First Trumpet</hi> are held
together, the latter <hi>Ioynt</hi> wherein the ending of the
<hi>Sixth Trumpet</hi> and the beginning of the <hi>seventh
Trumpet</hi> are held together, where according to the
Vision Ch. 11. is the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the question is, sith we see in <hi>Daniel</hi> the
Vision of the <hi>Ram</hi> and <hi>He-Goat</hi> placed so as it begins
with the <hi>first Ioynt</hi> of the two foregoing Prophecies
and ends with the <hi>third Ioynt,</hi> that is, begins with
the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy and ends with the <hi>Grecian,</hi>
the question, I say, is where the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Vials,</hi>
that is, to what <hi>Ioynt</hi> of those two more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
Visions [Ch. 11.] and [Ch. 12, 13, and 14.]
the beginning of the said partial Vision is to be
affixed, whether to the <hi>first</hi> or to the <hi>second Ioynt,</hi>
to the beginning of the <hi>first Trumpet</hi> or to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>seventh</hi> immediately after the <hi>Rising of
the Witnesses,</hi> with those <hi>Acclamations</hi> in Heaven and
<hi>Doxology</hi> of the Elders, Ch. 11. 15, 16. Or which
is the same <hi>Ioynt of</hi> Time to that joyfull <hi>Annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the happy news of <hi>Babylons</hi> being <hi>faln</hi> (whose
<hi>Fall</hi> must needs be the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses)</hi> told
by the second Angel, Ch. 14. 8. the question is, to
which of these two more universal or notable <hi>Ioynts</hi> (for
other <hi>Ioynts</hi> betwixt Trumpet and Trumpet, they
being so many, are more inconsiderable) the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59418:188"/>
of this <hi>partial</hi> Vision of the <hi>Vials</hi> is to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed.</p>
               <p>There is a temptation, I confess, to place the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the <hi>Vials</hi> with the beginning of the <hi>first
Trumpet,</hi> because of some specious correspondence
betwixt the <hi>Vials</hi> and Trumpets of the same order
or numeral denomination. For thus the <hi>Evil</hi> of
the <hi>first Trumpet</hi> as well as of the <hi>first Vial</hi> is cast
upon the <hi>Earth.</hi> As well under the <hi>second Vial</hi> as
under the <hi>second Trumpet</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> is turned into
<hi>Bloud,</hi> and the living creatures therein dye. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>third Trumpet</hi> and under the <hi>third Vial</hi> the
<hi>Rivers</hi> and Fountains are <hi>mischieved.</hi> The <hi>Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> is
smitten under the <hi>fourth Trumpet,</hi> and the <hi>fourth Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
also is poured out on the <hi>Sun.</hi> Under the <hi>fifth
Trumpet</hi> out of a pit comes up a smoak as out of a
furnace that <hi>darkens</hi> the Skie: Under the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> the
Kingdom of the Beast is full of <hi>darkness.</hi> Under the
<hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> the four Angels are loosed from the
great River <hi>Euphrates:</hi> Under the <hi>sixth Vial</hi> the
waters of the great River <hi>Euphrates</hi> are dried up.</p>
               <p>1. These Congruities thus overly and in general
represented make some shew, but look closer into
them and they vanish, (as being intended onely for
part of the Artifice of Concealment in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi>
or for an intimation that, as the first six plagues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the Fate of the Empire, so these seven last,
the state of the Popedome especially, after the six
first plagues were past, they orderly mentioning the
same things in both, or lastly to signify that the State
of the Empire under them was <hi>Aegypt</hi> (whence <hi>Hail,
Rivers</hi> turned into <hi>Bloud,</hi> and <hi>Locusts</hi> are mentioned)
as well as the Popedome afterwards was so, which
is also afflicted with <hi>Aegyptian</hi> plagues under the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als)
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59418:189"/>
I say, if we look closer into them these preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Synchronizing Congruities will signify no more
than thus, and so quite vanish.</p>
               <p>For in the first Congruity to say nothing how that
[upon the Earth] may have no particular significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Ch. 16. 2. but signify so as [upon the Earth]
in the foregoing verse; the Hail cast upon the Earth
under the first Trumpet is plainly another thing from
the noisome and grievous sore that fell upon men at
the pouring out of the first Vial. That Hail-storm and
this rankerous Ulcer most certainly signify quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
things as the Symbols are hugely different.
And I must confess I make no question in the world,
but that Symbol of a grievous <hi>rankerous Vlcer</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the plague of an <hi>envious malicious exulcerated
mind,</hi> which is the plague of Intoxication or Demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to them on whom it falls and spoils all their
counsels, they being given up to be actuated by evil
Angels and the fury of the Devil. This I conceive is
a sad plague indeed, and lively set out by the Symbol
of a <hi>vexatious Vlcer.</hi> But what an Hail-storm sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
in the Prophetick Style is so well known
that I need say nothing of it. Wherefore there is not
onely no Congruity betwixt the <hi>first Trumpet</hi> and
the <hi>first Vial</hi> to prove they must begin together, but
the <hi>Visa</hi> and the things signifyed by them being so
quite different, it is a strong barr against any such
presumption.</p>
               <p>The second Congruity indeed is more tolerable or
passable, if all the rest came to so near an agreement,
but in that there is nothing peculiar under the <hi>Second
Vial</hi> that answers to the <hi>burning Mountain</hi> cast into
the Sea under the <hi>second Trumpet,</hi> the correspondence
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>twixt this <hi>Vial</hi> and this <hi>Trumpet</hi> is visibly lame
and defectuous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:59418:189"/>The third also is a Congruity far more passable than
the first, but yet besides the defectuousness in the <hi>third
Vial</hi> that has nothing to answer to the falling Lamp
or Comet <hi>Lampadias</hi> under the <hi>third Trumpet;</hi> what
the Fountains and Rivers suffer under the <hi>third Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi>
is a misery to men and bitterness to them, what
they suffer under the <hi>third Vial</hi> is a refreshment to men
who praise and justify God upon the account.</p>
               <p>The fourth Congruity is wonderfully wretched
and small. The Sun indeed is smitten under the
<hi>fourth Trumpet,</hi> as well as the <hi>fourth Vial</hi> said to be
poured upon him, but not the Sun alone under the
<hi>fourth Trumpet,</hi> but the Moon also and the Stars; but
the Sun alone is mentioned in the <hi>fourth Vial.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the Sun, Moon and Stars lose their light and
the Sun consequently his heat under the fourth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet;
but the light and heat of the Sun is so invigorated
under the <hi>fourth Vial,</hi> that he scorches men so into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably
that they blaspheme again.</p>
               <p>And the fifth Congruity is yet slighter. The <hi>fifth
Vial</hi> is poured out upon the Seat of the Beast where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
his Kingdome becomes full of darkness. Upon
the sounding of the <hi>fifth Trumpet,</hi> the Angel of the
bottomless Pit, opens the pit and a smoke comes out
of it that darkens the Sun and Skie. In eleven large
verses wherein the <hi>Visum</hi> of the <hi>fifth Trumpet</hi> is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
there is no more that Symbolizes with the <hi>fifth
Vial</hi> than this, that is worth the speaking of. For
the gnawing their tongues for pain under the <hi>fifth
Vial,</hi> is from their impatiency of that dark inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
condition they were cast into, not from the sting
of any Scorpions. And for the <hi>darkness</hi> arising from
the Vial poured on the Seat of the Beast, and that
smoak and <hi>darkness</hi> out of the bottomless pit; as the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59418:190"/>
                  <hi>Seat of the Beast</hi> and <hi>bottomless Pit</hi> have no Analogy
one to another, so it is incredible that the darknesses
themselves should not be quite different things. So
small grounds or rather none at all is there for this
fifth Congrui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y.</p>
               <p>And as little for the sixth. For there is no corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency
betwixt the <hi>sixth Vial</hi> and the <hi>sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi>
but that the great River <hi>Euphrates</hi> is mentioned
in them both. For the description of the sixth Vial is
comprised within one verse of Ch. 16. <hi>viz.</hi> ver. 12. But
there is a large description of the sixth Trumpet Ch.9.
from v. 13. to v. 20. as there is also of the fifth Trumpet.</p>
               <p>II. Which consideration of the descriptions of the
<hi>six first Trumpets,</hi> their being either as large or much
larger than the descriptions of the <hi>first six Vials,</hi> is a
second argument against the placing of the beginning
of the <hi>Vials</hi> with the beginning of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> as of
a partial Vision whose beginning is to be fixt at the
<hi>first Ioint</hi> of the foregoing Prophecies of larger extent,
to the end that part of the larger extended Prophecies
might be more enlarged upon and more copiously
described, as it fares with the Vision of the <hi>Ram</hi> and
<hi>He-Goat</hi> in <hi>Daniel.</hi> Which partial Vision is annexed
to those two more large Visions for a fuller descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the affairs of the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Vision of the seven Vials the affixing the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of them to the beginning of the first Trumpet
not serving its due end, it is a sign it is misplaced, and
that the beginning thereof is to be placed in the <hi>second
Ioynt</hi> of those two larger Prophecies [the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
in the eleventh Chapter and the other in the
three following] and not in the <hi>first Ioynt.</hi> These
therefore are my two first Arguments against the
placing of the <hi>first Vial</hi> with the <hi>first Trumpet.</hi> The
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59418:190"/>
                  <hi>want</hi> of a continued <hi>Congruity</hi> betwixt the <hi>Trumpets</hi>
and <hi>Vials</hi> all along: And their uselesness for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
explaining the affairs of that part of the more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Visions that they are supposed to Synchronize
with. But that there is a part in those more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Prophecies [Ch. 11.] and [Ch. 12. and 13. and 14.]
that the <hi>Partial</hi> Vision of the Vials will properly serve
more copiously to illustrate, I shall note hereafter. I
am now onely intent upon the proving that the
<hi>Vials</hi> and <hi>Trumpets</hi> do not commence together.</p>
               <p>III. Of which I conceive this may be a third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
If we do but remember and take notice of
the <hi>second</hi> notable <hi>Ioynt</hi> in those two more universal
Prophecies (comprised, the one in the eleventh
Chapter and the other in the three following) and
how in the former that <hi>second</hi> notable <hi>Ioynt</hi> is in the
con-termination of the sixth Trumpets ending and the
beginning of the Seventh, where the <hi>Rising</hi> of the
<hi>Witnesses</hi> is, and those <hi>Acclamations</hi> in Heaven and
<hi>Doxology</hi> of the Elders; And the same <hi>Ioynt</hi> in the
latter Prophecy at that joyfull <hi>Annunciation</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
Babylon <hi>is faln is faln</hi> (which <hi>Fall,</hi> as I said above,
must needs be the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses:)</hi> The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thus the <hi>six first</hi> Vials to Synchronize with the
six first Trumpets, will leave the <hi>Seventh</hi> Vial alone to
posses the whole space of time and affairs from the
abovesaid <hi>second Ioynt</hi> to the end of those two Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Prophecies, whenas in Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
the <hi>seventh</hi> Vial Synchronizes with the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Wine-press;</hi> so that in the fourteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from vers. 9. to vers. 17. there is a Chasma of time
and affairs which the seventh Vial takenth not in, and
so in like manner in the eleventh Chapter, from the
same <hi>Ioynt</hi> of the Prophecy, to the <hi>seventh</hi> Vial signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59418:191"/>
in the last verse, there is such a Chasma leapt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by the seventh Vial. Which is too hard and
broken a business to have the seventh Vial thus by an
unnatural divulsion torn from the rest. But that the
seventh Vial ends both those Prophecies, there can be
no question with the judicious.</p>
               <p>IV. Fourthly, The plagues that the seven Vials
pour forth are the plagues upon some party and not
the meer beating of the Air, and it is a frigid and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
thing not to conceive the last plagues to concern
the same party on which the first were inflicted, so
that one party may be conceived to be afflicted by
them both. But the last (even the very first of them)
fall upon the marked slaves of the Beast as appears
from <hi>Apoc.</hi> Ch. 16. vers. 2. <hi>And the first went and
poured out his Vial on the Earth, and there fell a noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark
of the Beast, and upon them that worshipped his Image.</hi>
But these marked slaves of the Beast were not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before the first Trumpet, and not being before the
first Trumpet could receive none of the former
plagues. Whence it is manifest that the first Vial
cannot begin with the first Trumpet.</p>
               <p>V. Fifthly in brief thus: The very being of the
Beast commences but with the first Trumpet, but a
plague or punishment supposes some time wherein the
party may have committed some grievous offences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the plague or punishment is inflicted. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the pouring out the seven Vials cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
with the first Trumpet, Because then the
Beast would be plagued before he has had any time
to commit any considerable offences.</p>
               <p>VI. Sixthly, The seven Vials are called the seven
last plagues. Wherefore if we place the first Vial so as
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59418:191"/>
to commence with the first Trumpet, I demand where
be the foregoing plagues in respect of which the seven
Vials are to be called the seven last plagues? For the first
six Seals, there is no intimation that they are so many
plagues, but rather the contrary is intimated, that
the plagues and vengeance upon the Roman Empire
was not to be poured out till the sounding of the
Trumpets, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> interprets that of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6. 10.
<hi>How long O Lord Holy and true, dost thou not judge
and avenge our bloud on them that dwell on the earth?</hi>
And whereas answer was given to them, that they
should rest yet for a little season, till their fellow-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
also were killed, that little season Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>
with judgment interprets, till the sounding of the
Trumpets, then vengeance would be taken on the
Saint-murdering Empire. But that complaint of the
Souls of the Martyrs under the Altar that no ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
was taken, it shews plainly that the five first
Seals are not five plagues, and the conversion of the
Empire to Christianity under the sixth was no dilace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of it, as happened afterwards, nor reputed by
the Apocalypse as a plague. And it would be a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
business to name the seven plagues of the Vials,
the seven last plagues in respect of one solitary plague
before it, which yet is no <hi>Aegyptian</hi> plague neither,
but the very first plague of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> is <hi>Aegyptian</hi>
viz. <hi>Hail,</hi> as the very first plague of the <hi>Vials</hi> is
also <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> viz. <hi>Sores</hi> or <hi>Vlcers.</hi> Wherefore no
number of plagues being taken notice of in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse</hi>
before the six Trumpets which are unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
six plagues, and there is a solemn premunition
of the servants of God against them Ch. 7. the
plagues of the <hi>seven Vials</hi> is being the seven <hi>last
plagues</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> cannot commnece with the <hi>first
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59418:192"/>
Trumpet,</hi> which is but the first <hi>Aegyptian plague</hi> of the
Mystical <hi>Aegypt</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>VII. Wherefore seventhly, The <hi>seven last plagues</hi>
of the <hi>Vials</hi> supposing a <hi>Sett</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> of plagues
antecedent, and there being no other <hi>Sett</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> of
plagues but those of the <hi>six Trumpets,</hi> it is manifest
that that <hi>Sett</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> of plagues of the six Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
are the antecedent plagues to the seven last
plagues of the Vials, and that these seven plagues of
the Vials follow them, and therefore do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
with the first Trumpet.</p>
               <p>VIII. And now in the eighth place, Though all
the six first Trumpets are in the general plagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Roman Empire, yet the Wo-Trumpets more
especially for their Pagano-Christian Idolatry and
persecution as is expresly declared <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9. 20. And
therefore in respect of the fifth and sixth Trumpets
especially, though of all six in general, (they being
plagues upon <hi>Aegypt</hi> as I noted above) would I have
the plagues of the seven Vials called the seven last
plagues; and indeed where can the seven <hi>last plagues</hi>
be more properly placed than in the <hi>last Wo-Trumpet,</hi>
or in the seventh or last Trumpet, it being a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of plagues upon that party of men that did
not repent them of the works of their hands, of their
worshipping of <hi>Daemons</hi> and Idols of Gold and Silver,
and of murdering the servants of God upon a false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of their Heresy, notwithstanding they were
forewarned by the plagues of the two first <hi>Wo-Trumpets,</hi>
the <hi>Locusts</hi> and <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen.
But if the first of the seven last plagues be to be
placed in the seventh Trumpet, it cannot commence
with the first.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:59418:192"/>IX. Ninthly and lastly, Those plagues that follow
a victory over the Beast and over his Image and over
his Mark and over the number of his name, which
certainly signifies the two-horned Beast, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
with the first Trumpet, because this two hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Beast could neither be fought with nor be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
before the first Trumpet, he having no exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
before that Trumpet. But the seven last
plagues of the Vials follow the abovesaid victory as
appears from <hi>Apoc.</hi> 15. and 16. where those that had
got the victory over the Beast are said to stand on
the Sea of glass, having the Harps of God in their
hands, and to sing the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> the servant of
God and of the Lamb, which is a plain <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a
<hi>Song of Triumph,</hi> answering to that of the Israelites
upon the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the red Sea. So
that it is a <hi>Triumphal</hi> song upon an <hi>actual</hi> victory.
This is most punctuall and plain, in Chap. 15. and it
is said immediately after this song, <hi>That the Temple
of the Tabernacle of the Testimony in Heaven was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
That the seven Angels having the seven Plagues
came out of it, and that unto them were given seven
Golden Vials full of the Wrath of God,</hi> and Chap. 16.
1. <hi>they are there commanded to pour them out.</hi> There
is no wriggling out of this plain evidence, that the
plagues of the seven Vials all of them follow the
victory over the Beast. And therefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
they should commence with the first Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</p>
               <p>But it may be you will say, what is all this to the
purpose as to Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> who does not make the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
to commence with the <hi>first</hi> Trumpet, but rather
with the <hi>sixth?</hi> I grant he does so, and yet what
I have wrote is much to the purpose. Because if once
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59418:193"/>
a man be beaten off from placing the first Vial
with the first Trumpet, so as they may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
from the <hi>first</hi> notable <hi>Ioynt</hi> of the two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
(comprised the one in the eleventh Chapter,
the other in the three following Chapters) the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the first Vial being loosened from this <hi>first</hi>
notable <hi>Ioynt</hi> will naturally slide down and fix it
self at the <hi>second</hi> notable <hi>Ioynt</hi> of the Prophecies,
namely, in the beginning of the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi>
where those <hi>Acclamations</hi> in Heaven upon the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Witnesses,</hi> and <hi>Doxology</hi> of the Elders do
occur.</p>
               <p>But besides, the second, seventh, eighth and ninth
arguments prove not onely, That the first Vial is not
to commence with the first Trumpet, but that it is
to be placed after the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> in the
seventh. For according to our second argument the
commencement of the Vials being placed at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
notable Joynt, they will then (in Analogy to
that partial Vision in <hi>Daniel</hi> of the <hi>Ram</hi> and <hi>He-Goat)</hi>
more largely illustrate the affairs of those times they
are applied to, namely from the beginning of the
seventh Trumpet to the end of those two Prophecies,
which conclude with the Vials, as no man doubts. For
there being but some few slight intimations of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Vials, Ch. 11. from v. 18. to the end of the
Chapter, as in that it is said <hi>The Nations were angry,</hi>
which belongs to the first Vial, and, <hi>And thy wrath
is come and the time of the dead,</hi> &amp;c. which belongs
to the third, as also, <hi>And there was seen in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the Ark of the Covenant,</hi> which refers to the sixth
Vial, and, <hi>An Earthquake and great Hail,</hi> which
belongs to the seventh. These things which are
so sparingly hinted in this part of the Vision from the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59418:193"/>
second Joynt to the end, are more fully insisted on
in the Vision of the Vials, Ch. 16. through the whole
Chapter. As also instead of those <hi>Acclamations</hi> in
Heaven upon the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> and the
<hi>Doxology</hi> of he <hi>Elders,</hi> there is a <hi>Triumphal song</hi> of
<hi>Moses</hi> and the Lamb in the fifteenth Chapter.</p>
               <p>Which also makes amends for that more sparing
<hi>Annunciation</hi> of the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Ch. 14. 8. where
is the <hi>second Ioynt</hi> of the other Prophecy: after which
to vers. 13. the things of the fourth Vial are glanced
at, and from vers. 13. to vers. 14. the things of the
fifth Vial, and from vers. 14. to vers. 17. the things
of the sixth Vial; and from thence to the end of the
Chapter the things of the seventh. But that one <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Vision</hi> of the seven Vials contained in the fifteenth
and sixteenth Chapters makes a full illustration of that
time they are applied to namely from the joyfull <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation</hi>
of the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> to the end of the
Chapter: But is the most proper Supplement of all
affixed to the second Joynt of the Vision in Ch. 11.
From whence we may be sure that the affixing this
one <hi>partial Vision</hi> contained in the fifteenth and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapters to the <hi>second Ioynt</hi> of those two more
universal Visions, is sound and right.</p>
               <p>And now for the seventh argument, it has its force
to prove not onely that the first Vial does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
with the first Trumpet, but that it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the sixth, the whole <hi>set</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>last
plagues</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi> being so called in respect of the
whole <hi>Set</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>plagues</hi> of the <hi>Six Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.</hi>
This I say is most natural and which ought
to take place unless some necessary reason withstand,
which I question not but will never be found. And as for
the eighth argument it also does directly prove that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59418:194"/>
the plagues of the Vials do follow the sixth Trumpet,
as is plain at first sight to him that peruses it. And
for the last it is an invincible evidence that <hi>all</hi> the
<hi>Vials</hi> follow the <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> or the <hi>Rising</hi> of the
<hi>Witnesses,</hi> and are placed in the seventh, forasmuch as
they follow a notable victory and triumph over the
Beast. And where can there be imagined any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
victory and triumph over the Beast but that
which is expressed in the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Winesses</hi> with
which the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> Ch. 14. 8. as well as the
Fall of the City by an Earthquake, Ch. 11. 13. <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronizes.</hi>
But upon the <hi>Fall</hi> of this City and the
<hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> it is said, the <hi>Second Woe</hi> is
past and the <hi>Third</hi> cometh quickly, and that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Angel founded and there were great voices
in Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore the Vials following this
victory (which is the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses)</hi> and
the <hi>Acclamations</hi> in Heaven and <hi>Doxology</hi> of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
which answer to the Triumphal Song of <hi>Moses</hi>
and the Lamb prefixed before the Vials, Ch. 15. it
is plain that the <hi>Vials</hi> follow the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
and are to be placed in the seventh Trumpet
after the <hi>Doxology</hi> of the Elders as they are placed
Ch. 15. and 16. after the Triumphal Song of <hi>Moses</hi>
the servant of God and of the Lamb. Nothing I
think can be more demonstrable.</p>
               <p>And it is worth our noting here, How that the
whole two Chapters, <hi>viz.</hi> Ch. 15. and 16. though
they be so divided are indeed but one <hi>Partial Vision
Synchronizing</hi> with the last part of those two more
universal Visions, comprised (the one in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Chapter, the other in the three following
Chapters) and beginning with the <hi>second</hi> main <hi>Ioynt</hi>
of them, the Acclamations in Heaven and Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59418:194"/>
of the Elders, or joyfull <hi>Annunciation</hi> of the
news of the Fall of <hi>Babylon.</hi> So that that Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of the Elders, the joyfull <hi>Annunciation,</hi> and the
<hi>Triumphal Song</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Lamb, fall in toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to which you may add the commencement of the
Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> which also signifies a <hi>Song of Ioy.</hi>
Which coincidency of things to my reason is very
harmonious, the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church being the state of
the Church commencing with the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
which state is promised to the Church in <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atira,</hi>
the preceeding interval thereof.</p>
               <p>To all which you may add; Whereas Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>
cannot deny but that the <hi>Vial-plagues</hi> are called the
<hi>last</hi> Plagues in reference to the <hi>Trumpet-plagues,</hi> and
that the <hi>Trumpet-plagues</hi> are just Six as well as the
<hi>Vial-plagues</hi> Seven, I would appeal to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> if
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> had had occasion to express himself therein,
whether he would not have called the Six <hi>Trumpet-plagues</hi>
the Six <hi>first</hi> Plagues, as well as he calls [ch. 15.]
the Seven <hi>Vial-plagues</hi> the Seven <hi>last.</hi> Whence it
will necessarily follow that <hi>all</hi> the Seven last Plagues
of the Vials must follow <hi>all</hi> the Six first plagues of
the Trumpets, whenas according as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has
placed the Vials, onely <hi>one</hi> of the seven <hi>Vial-plagues</hi>
namely the seventh follows the six <hi>Trumpet-plagues,</hi>
which is an apparent Repugnancy. Nay, merely
in that the <hi>Vial-plagues, all seven</hi> of them are said to
be the <hi>last</hi> Plagues, that, I say, does plainly imply
that none of them are to be before the ending of <hi>all</hi>
the Trumpet-plagues, else they <hi>all seven</hi> (though they
are said to be so, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>seven last plagues)</hi> could
not be the <hi>last,</hi> but five of them according to Mr.
<hi>Mede</hi>'s placing of them would expire before the six
<hi>Trumpet-plagues,</hi> which is apparently absurd. For
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59418:195"/>
                  <hi>last of all</hi> in Succession supposes the other all to
have given place and to be gone, but by no means
the <hi>last themselves</hi> to expire before them. And these
Vial-plagues all seven of them are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
the <hi>very last seven Plagues,</hi> which they
cannot be if any of them expire before any of the
six Trumpet-plagues.</p>
               <p>These arguments are so considerable to me, that I
make no doubt at all but that the <hi>Vials</hi> are to be
placed in the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> after the <hi>Rising</hi> of the
<hi>Witnesses,</hi> and whether they satisfy others so as to
make them of one mind with my self or no, yet I
hope they will not stick to acknowledg that I have
not rashly deviated from the Tract of Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> and
so not violated that Right, which is due to so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
an Interpreter.</p>
               <p>But there is yet I confess another thing touching
the Witnesses that Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and I do not agree in,
which is the time of their lying dead, which the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
expresses by <hi>three days and an half.</hi> He will
have it to signify <hi>three years and an half,</hi> but I must
confess I am fully assured in my own mind that those
three days and an half are the very same that
<hi>three Times and an half.</hi> Nor is this a new opinion
of my own, but I met with it near fourty years
ago by chance at the end of a <hi>Socinian</hi> Book in
Quarto, but the Title of the Book I have forgot,
and the <hi>Socinians,</hi> every one knows, are rather
dry Reasoners than phancifull Writers. And after
I met with it again in <hi>Clavis Apocalyptica ad Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
revocata,</hi> published <hi>A. D.</hi> 1652. and since that
in that pious and learned Authour <hi>A. B. Peganius,</hi>
his <hi>Genuine Explication of the Visions of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
who though he most-what follows Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:59418:195"/>
in other things, yet he leaves him in this. And that
all people are not of the same mind herein with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganius</hi>
and my self, the onely objections that I know
are First, That the Witnesses are said to be slain at
the <hi>ending</hi> or finishing of their mournfull Prophecy.
Secondly, That if the <hi>three days and an half</hi> be the
same with the <hi>three Times and an half,</hi> which is the
same with 1260 days or 42 months, which are but
various expressions of the three Times and an half,
then the Witnesses will be conceived to speak and
prophesie while they lie dead, than which nothing
can be more absurd. This I confess would be an
harsh repugnancy.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to remove these Obstacles, the Reader
must learn to distinguish betwixt the <hi>Cortex</hi> and
the <hi>Pith,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Rine</hi> and the <hi>Pulp</hi> of these
Parabolical or Symbolical Visions. In which if the
parts of the <hi>Pith</hi> or <hi>Pulp</hi> agree amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as well as those of the <hi>Rine</hi> or <hi>Cortex</hi> amongst
themselves, all then is sound, compleat and harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
But those that make the above named Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
seem to me to doe as the Welch-man did, that
bit the <hi>Rine</hi> of the Orange into his mouth together
with the <hi>Pulp,</hi> which made him sputter and make
hard faces. The Vision or Prophetical Parable it self
is very neat and coherent taking it in its <hi>Literal</hi> sense,
which represents the two Witnesses lying slain three
days and an half after their 1260 days Prophesying
in Sack-cloth. So that as their <hi>natural Death</hi> and
Prophesying in Sack-cloth are inconsistent one with
another, so they are disjoyned one from another in
the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Parable, and their death represented
as an effect of their 1260 days Prophesying. But
by this <hi>natural Death</hi> being signified their <hi>Political
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59418:196"/>
Death,</hi> or Deprivation of all Power in Church
or State (for their <hi>Resurrection</hi> is into that Power)
which <hi>Political Death</hi> is part of the <hi>Pulp</hi> or <hi>Pith</hi> of
the Parable, this is not onely consistent with their
mournfull Prophecy but the very cause thereof. So
that the parts of the <hi>Pith</hi> or <hi>Pulp</hi> of the Prophecy
cohere one with another singularly well, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of the Prophetick Parable is of admirable
elegancy and festivity.</p>
               <p>For the matter to be represented being this, That
for a certain time holy, good and Apostolical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
sit for employment in Church or State, shall
in the <hi>Apostasie</hi> of the Church be for a time kept
out of employment, namely, for that time denoted
by <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Time and Times and half a Time, which
is three Prophetical years and an half, resolvible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
1260 Days, or 42 Months Prophetical: Which
being kept out of power and employment is a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Death</hi> to them, though they in the mean time
in this low condition bear witness against the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the said times; but it being also that at
the end of the said Times there will be such a change
of things that they will come again into power both
in Church and State: First by an <hi>Henopaeia</hi> the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of these two sorts of men thus kept out of
power are turned into two single persons called two
Witnesses. Then they are clothed in sack-cloth as
well as made to Prophesie, to shew their low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the World. Thirdly, it being incredible that
two single persons should each of them live 1260
years, they are said by an <hi>Antichronismus</hi> to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
onely 1260 Days, namely, the days of their
deprivation of all power in Church or State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they lay like dead carcases as to any <hi>Political</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:59418:196"/>
Power or Influence upon the World, though they
were yet in Being then, as being the woman in the
Wilderness, as it is expressed by another Symbol.
But this dead condition of theirs representable by an
unburied carcase, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the <hi>Cortex</hi>
might be observed, is not to expatiate unto 1260
days, much less to so many years, but by another
<hi>Antichrenismus</hi> though the same time is signified, is
to be contracted into <hi>three days and an half.</hi> For
who could endure that two carcases should lye stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the streets of the City suppose 1260 days or
three years and an half? Besides the incredibility of
their being raised to life after so long a time. And
though these three days and an half be set at the end
of the 1260 days, yet by a <hi>Lemmatosynechia,</hi> a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
usual in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> they are easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to belong to the antecedent time and to Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronize
with it. See my <hi>Synopsis Prophetica</hi> Book 1.
Ch. 4. in <hi>Antichronismus.</hi> Therefore this is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<hi>Decorum</hi> observed in the outward <hi>Cortex</hi> of
the Vision, that their Political Death which is exactly
Synchronal to the time of their mourning in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
which is said to be 1260 days, is contracted
into three days and an half, signifying there <hi>Daniels
three times and an half,</hi> as <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> sometimes
signify the same thing. This Parabolical Prophecy
of the two Witnesses thus understood, has a most
enravishing festivity and elegancy in it, and is one
of the choicest examples of that Divine wit and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of <hi>Concealment,</hi> as well as <hi>Revealment,</hi> that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr

                  </gap> here is a word which the Spirit of Prophecy
has made choice of to serve as well the sense of the

our English Translation has pitched upon that sense
which onely comports with the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

                  </gap>
will easily and naturally signify, <hi>While they shall
be performing or declaring their Testimony,</hi> the
Beast shall make war against them and kill them, that
is the successive body of them, kill them all succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
in that <hi>Political</hi> sense, or keep them succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
dead from the first suppression of them, and
kill some of this successive body according to a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
death, even many Myriads of them as History
can witness. So easily is the difficulty of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>

                  </gap> has two senses, the
one serving the <hi>Pith</hi> the other the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the
Parable, as <hi>Day</hi> has two senses vers. 9. and relating
to the <hi>Cortex</hi> signifies a <hi>natural</hi> day, but to the <hi>Pith</hi>
it signifies <hi>Time,</hi> in such a sense as Time is taken in
<hi>Daniel,</hi> Ch. 7. vers. 25.</p>
               <p>And now I hope I have made it abundantly plain
that there is no Incongruity in this Opinion of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganius</hi>
and mine, in making the <hi>three days and an
half</hi> the same with Daniel's <hi>Time and Times and half
a Time,</hi> or 1260 days Prophetically understood.
Nothing hinders but this may be the sense. But
now I shall produce reasons to prove that it really
is so.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:59418:197"/>As first, It being a Number consisting of three
<hi>Integrums</hi> and an Half as <hi>Daniels</hi> three Times and an
half is, and the 42 Months and 1260 Days being but
the varying of the phrase for the <hi>Three Times and an
Half,</hi> if a man have but any competency of Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptick
<hi>Nasuteness</hi> or <hi>Sagacity</hi> in him, he will easily
smell out the high probability of these <hi>three days and
an half</hi> being the same with the <hi>three Times and an
half</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and consequently the same with the
1260 Days of the mournfull Prophecy of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There being no example in all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse
at least, and, I think, no where else, of the
affectation of predicting things to the curiosity of
half a year, it is plainly incredible that there should
be any such affectation here.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the condition of the Apostolick Church
be ever brought to so sad a condition again as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by the carcases of the two Witnesses lying
dead in the streets of the great City, it is incredible
that they should recover again within the space of
three years and an half. The conceit looks almost as
Romantickly or fabulously, and out of the same ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the Apocalyptick <hi>Antichronisme,</hi> as that
of the Romanists, who tell us what strange feats
<hi>Antichrist</hi> shall do in the same space of Time, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
within the space of three years and an half, when
an age would scarce be sufficient to compass such
Atchievements.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If we restrain the lying dead of the
Witnesses to the three years and an half at the end
of their Prophesying, there is nothing in the Vision
to represent their Political Death (to which their
Resurrection relates) before that time, though they
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59418:198"/>
have been dead in that sense at least 1260 years al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
Which is exceeding absurd.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Being that the witnesses have lyen slain
in a <hi>Political</hi> sense, and have been so often slain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred thousands of them in a <hi>Natural</hi> sense
before the end of their mournfull witnessing, it is
unconceivable what persecution or oppression in
these last three years and an half different from what
they had endured before, should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>efall them, or more
worthy of taking notice, that the former should be
omitted, and these by the carcases lying three days
and an half in the street, be represented.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and lastly, Whereas it is said, v. 7. <hi>And
when they shall have finished their Testimony, the Beast
that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war
against them and shall overcome them and kill them,</hi>
unless my sense be admitted; Till the end of their
Prophesying there is neither any war nor any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
nor any killing of the Witnesses, which is
point-blank against the Truth of History.</p>
               <p>This which I have produced as it does fully satisfy
my self, that the <hi>three days and an half,</hi> are the same
with <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>three Times and an half,</hi> so I hope that
other will also be satisfied, if not of the Truth of
the thing, yet at least that I have not rashly dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>We having thus solidly stated the sense of this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi>
which was the true sense thereof many hundred
years ago, and ever will be, we may now the more
seasonably enquire whether the Prophecy be yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
or no. Which if it be not and the Witnesses
be not risen, it is evident from what we have proved
above, (viz. <hi>That the Vials follow the Rising of the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59418:198"/>
Witnesses)</hi> that there is not yet one Vial poured out.
But there is no Protestant Interpreter that I know
but will allow that some of the Vials are already pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out. Wherefore unless they will shamefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil,
they must of necessity acknowledg that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
are already risen. But I shall use but one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
for all to prove that this Vision or Prophecy
of the Rising of the Witnesses is already fulfilled.</p>
               <p>What a remarkable Providence, as touching the
Church of God, and what a vast change of affairs
there was in the Papacy at the late Reformation, is
notorious, and what an innumerable company of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were delivered out of that worse than <hi>Aegyptian</hi>
Bondage of the Pope; and multitudes who because of
their supposed Hereticalness lay dead, useless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
to all Political Power, whether in Church or
State, being excluded therefrom for their falsly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Heresy, got into the most honourable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
at the Reformation both in Church and
State; Nay, that the highest honours were in the
hands of the Protestants in many intire Kingdomes
and Principalities, which had been under the Papacy
before. What a marvellous, nay stupendious change
this was, no man can but be sensible of, and therefore
that it must be, and that in no slight manner, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it cannot be predicted in any of those Visions
that in order of time follow the Vision of the Rising
of the Witnesses as the Vials do, because this notable
and stupendious mutation of things has happened al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and as those of the adverse party would
have it, before the Rising of the Witnesses. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I demand of them in what Vision, which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
to the Vision of the Rising of the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59418:199"/>
is this so remarkable and marvellous a piece of
Providence predicted or prefigured? I am confident
they cannot find any before this of the Rising of the
Witnesses. Wherefore it must be this Vision of the
Rising of the Witnesses which prefigured this stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
piece of Providence in the Reformation, or else
none at all. Which were an absurdity intolerable
and utterly incredible. Wherefore it is even Mathe
matically evident, that the Vision of the <hi>Rising of the
Witnesses</hi> is a Prophecy of the late <hi>Reformation,</hi> and
that it is fulfilled therein.</p>
               <p>And this it would be, though it were less significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of that marvellous passage of Providence than it
is. But that it is most fitly and fully significative
thereof, as if made on purpose for it, my Exposition
of it in my <hi>Apocalypsis Apocalypseos</hi> and elsewhere,
will I hope abundantly make good, which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
here to repeat, as also how naturally the Song of
<hi>Moses</hi> the Servant of God and of the Lamb follows the
Rising of the Witnesses, which contains a deliverance
of the Servants of God from that worse than <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
Bondage of that Mystical <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the Pope, and
how the <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval of the Church which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a <hi>Song of Ioy,</hi> commences at the same time. Which
things fall in with that Congruity and Harmony, that
he must be something more than ordinary stupid that
is not enravished therewith.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time having observed, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Messias</hi> who is called the Christ, when he
was come, though predicted plainly enough by the
Prophecies, was taken notice of as such, by them
that were concerned to take notice of him, nor yet
Antichrist (as fully nay more fully and repeatedly
predicted and prefigured) was taken notice of by
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59418:199"/>
them who were sufficiently concerned so to do; I
less wonder that the Prophecy of the <hi>Rising of the
Witnesses,</hi> so punctually predicted and manifestly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> should be so little taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of as it is, but that several men, as the <hi>Iews</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a <hi>Messias</hi> to come, and the <hi>Romanists</hi> an <hi>Antichrist,</hi>
so they a <hi>Rising of the Witnesses</hi> to come, when the
impletion of that Prophecy is so evidently already
past. Wherefore it was the duty of some or other
to remind them of it.</p>

               <p>1. AS in Natural Hypotheses, those are accounted
truest that solve the Phaenomena of Nature the
most naturally and easily, and especially if such as are
no otherwise solvible than upon the proposed Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis:
so that meaning of Scripture, I mean especially
of any considerable portion thereof, ought to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
truest that can solve the most Difficulties that
may be raised concerning the same, or the Contexts
precedent or subsequent / thereto; and if all, still the
more certain; and if unsolvible otherwise, there is still
the more assurance of undeniable Demonstration. Now
how near this Mystical or Propheticall Exposition
of these Epistles approaches to the clearness of this
case, I will leave to the Reader to judge, after he has
considered the Solutions of the questions easily raised
out of the Epistles themselves, or the precedent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and not easily answered, nor at all satisfactorily, at
least most of them, but upon the Hypothesis we have
gone.</p>
               <p>2. As first, If a man enquire why the Spirit of
Prophecy, after he has so expresly given notice that
this Book of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is to shew unto his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
things that are to come,<note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 1, 3.</note> and called it plainly
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59418:200"/>
a <hi>Book of Prophecies,</hi> should start so unexpectedly
from the Title and intended Subject, as to write no
less than seven Epistles to certain Churches, that
have nothing considerable of Prophecy in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he deliver any <hi>Prophecies</hi> properly so called, but
onely <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Comminations;</hi> and that he should
do this * with as great Pomp and as high a Preamble
as he does when he begins so famous Prophecies as
those of the <hi>seven Seals,</hi> and the <hi>opened Book.</hi> But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our Hypothesis the Answer is easie; <hi>viz.</hi>
That though these seven Epistles to the seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Asia</hi> have a <hi>Literal</hi> sense, yet they are also
a Parable or <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and of as high concern for
both matter and extent of Time (they reaching from
the beginning of the Church to the end of the world)
as the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>Seals</hi> and <hi>Opened Book;</hi> and that
they are ushered in with this great Pomp on purpose
to give us notice thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A man would be prone to enquire why
the Spirit dictates Letters unto the Churches in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
and not rather to the Churches in <hi>Europe, Asia</hi>
and <hi>Africk.</hi> For certainly the Church had disspred it
self into all these Quarters of the world by that time.
As if the Spirit of Truth were a respecter of persons.
For these are not the Letters of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but of the
Holy Ghost. But our Answer is ready at hand,
* That for the significancy of the word <hi>Asia</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
also with the significancy of the names of the
seven Churches, <hi>Asia</hi> alone was pitched upon. But,
according to the <hi>Prophetical</hi> sense, the true <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Church is writ unto under such distinct condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as she was to vary into, unto the end of the
world. So that there is no Partiality nor Acception
of Persons in this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:59418:201"/>Thirdly, If a man demand touching the order or
precedency of these Seven Churches that are writ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
What a plain and manifest account is there to him
that compares the Epistles in their Prophetical sense
with the Intervals of the Church Catholick lying in
that order that these Churches are ranged? This is
a satisfactory reason, and worthy the Spirit that wrote
these Epistles. But whether they are ranged in this
order, * because that a Letter-carrier going from
<hi>Patmos,</hi> his first journey will be to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and then
to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and so in order till he come to <hi>Laodicea;</hi>
whether the holy Spirit of Prophecy regarded that in
the dictating of his Letters, (though <hi>Alcazar</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
be for it) I cannot but suspend my judgment, and
that not without a smile. But of this Ataxie more
particularly anon.</p>
               <p>3. Fourthly, If it be demanded why just <hi>Seven</hi>
Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> are writ to, neither more nor less,
(especially that in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> according to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> being then not founded, but
after the writing of these Epistles,) it is hard to give
a satisfactory answer in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense. For to say
this Book of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> affects the number <hi>Seven,</hi>
and that, because it runs upon the number <hi>Seven</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
in the ensuing part of the Book, which is
<hi>Prophetical,</hi> it therefore, for Conformity sake, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
this number in writing to the Churches though
<hi>Literally</hi> understood, seems but a meagre, mean,
and trifling account, a design unworthy the Holy
Spirit that dictated this Book. But the using this
number <hi>Seven</hi> all over is rather an intimation that
the Book is <hi>Prophetical</hi> all over, and that these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
are also a Prophecy, accordingly as we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
them. And taking them so, the Answer is
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59418:201"/>
plain and obvious, <hi>viz.</hi> The number <hi>Seven</hi> is here
chosen out as Symbolical, it being the note of <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality;</hi>
whence the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> as I elsewhere
have noted, call it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Seven</hi> (and no more than Seven) Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are writ unto, as standing for the seven Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of the Church from the beginning to the end of
all.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If it be demanded why these seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
rather than any others, which in all likelihood
may have the same Vertues and Vices that these are
commended and taxed for: The Reason of this is
writ in the very Notation of their Names, every
Name being significative of the Condition of the
Church Catholick in that successive Intervall of time
that this or that Church so named standeth for, and
in such order as they are repeated.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If one require a Reason why Christ is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by holding the seven Stars in his right hand
in the Epistles to the Churches of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Sardis,</hi>
why the same description in both, or why in either:
In the <hi>Literal</hi> sense it will be hard to find any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Reason; but in the Prophetical sense already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
it is obvious. For the <hi>seven Stars</hi> signify all
the Pastours, whether in present existence, or succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
And <hi>Ephesus</hi> is the begnning-state of the Church;
and therefore it is both very seasonable and methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
to represent the First Founder, Sustainer and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuer
thereof, by this Emblem; <hi>Lo! I am with you
to the end of the World.</hi> And that this again is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at in the Epistle to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> is with
evident Proportion and Analogy to the Affairs of the
Church there represented. For the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi>
is as it were the beginning again or the emerging of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59418:202"/>
the true Church or Kingdome of Christ out of the
Power and Kingdome of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>4. Seventhly, Why the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of all
other Churches, should be commended for their try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
false Apostles. Why might not other Churches
be attacqued by them, and also discover them, as
well as the Church of <hi>Ephesus?</hi> The Solution of
which Problem is easy in this Mystical sense of the
Epistles, * that places the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Interval within
the Apostles times, but the rest on this side of them.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, If any one demand why it is said to the
Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> more than to any other Church,
<hi>Be thou faithfull unto death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 10,
11.</note> 
                  <hi>and I will give thee the
Crown of life;</hi> and again, <hi>He that overcometh shall
not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> hurt by the second death:</hi> In the <hi>Literal</hi> sense
it will be very hard to find any peculiar Reason why
this might not as well be said to the Church in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus,</hi>
where there was killing for Religion, it seems,
by the mention of the Martyr <hi>Antipas:</hi> I, but there
was no obtaining the <hi>Crown of life</hi> there in any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
sense; but the <hi>Crown of life,</hi> that is, the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Crown</hi> was given to the sufferings of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Martyrs under the Ten Persecutions: to whom
also according to the opinion of the Antient Church
the Promise of the first Resurrection belonged. Which
is here obliquely glanced at, (according to the mode of
the <hi>Apocalyptik</hi> style, that loves to hint things by El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipses)
in that Promise,<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>He that overcometh shall not
be hurt by the second death,</hi> implying thereby, that
he shall be made partaker of the first Resurrection.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, If any one will again object more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
against the <hi>Ataxie</hi> of the Churches, that
they are ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ged neither according to the merit, nor
congeneracy of their Conditions, pretending that it
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59418:202"/>
had been far better to have joyned the two irrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
together, <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> against
whom there is no complaint at all; and then <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> against whom there is no
complaint of eating things offered unto Idols; and
afterwards <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> in which Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
alone there is: If any one, I say, contend that
this method had been more exact; truly in the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi>
sense it will be hard to frame an handsome and
satisfactory answer; especially if he urge, that God
is the Authour of <hi>Method,</hi> as well as the God of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
But in this Mystical or Prophetical sense the
Answer is solid and exquisite, and much what the
same that was given to the like difficulty more generally
propounded before, namely, That the Churches of
<hi>Asia</hi> are named in that order the Successive intervals
of the Church Catholick were to proceed in, of which
these <hi>Asiatick</hi> Churches are but the Symbols or Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks.
And therefore those two Intervals of
time which take in the Reign of the Beast and the False
Prophet, <hi>viz.</hi> the Intervals of the Church of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
and of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> must come after <hi>Ephesus</hi> and
<hi>Smyrna,</hi> because till the expiration of those two Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
Idolatry had not again reentred the Apostatizing
Church. And the three following intervals of <hi>Sardis,
Philadelphia</hi> and <hi>Laodicea</hi> are the Intervals of the true
Church elapsed out of the hands of domineering Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and therefore we hear no more in them of things sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59418:203"/>
But of this more than enough, because we had
touched of it in the general before.</p>
               <p>5. Tenthly, Why is Christ in his Description
before the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> set out
by a two edged Sword,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 12.</note> coming, suppose, out of his
mouth (according to the <hi>Ellipticalness</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptick
style?) what reason in the <hi>Letter</hi> can be
given of that? for (especially if this Supplement be
made) it cannot respect the slaying of <hi>Antipas</hi> with
the sword. What peculiar thing then in this Church
of <hi>Pergamus</hi> is there to require this Description?
Truly nothing at all appears in the <hi>Letter,</hi> but in
the <hi>Prophetical</hi> sense it is very proper, The <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and <hi>Albigenses</hi> in this Interval assaulting the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or at least defending themselves
and their pure Faith, so signally by this Weapon, I
mean by the sword of the Spirit, which is the
Word of God; though themselves died so many
thousands of them in the field by the sword for the
Faith they thus defended.</p>
               <p>And in the Eleventh place, The description of
Christ before the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Thyatira,
And his Feet like fine Brass,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 18.</note>
(as if they burned in
a Furnace)</hi> (for that Supplement is to be understood
out of his Description in the first Chapter, as before:)
But now what peculiar significancy has this descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or what congruity to any thing in the Church
of <hi>Thyatira Literally</hi> understood? surely none. But
in the <hi>Prophetical</hi> sense it is very expressive of those
lower members of Christ's Body, his Church here
on Earth, of their invincible Zeal and Patience, and
Sincerity of Affection, such as did abide the most
fiery Tryals that could be put upon them, and made
them stand at the Stake amongst burning Faggots
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59418:203"/>
with the Flames about their ears, and never flinch
for it: As has been noted in the Interpretation of
that Epistle. This was the state of that Interval of
the Church.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, In a Book that is so full of Aenigmatical
Involutions, and coverings upon coverings, where
he calls the Churches Golden Candlesticks, and the
Bishops or Pastours, Stars and Angels, even then
when he interprets, and offers to be more plain; that
the same Authour should so openly and plainly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
any one by name as he does the Martyr <hi>Antipas,</hi>
if there were not some farther Mystery in it, would be
a great Difficulty, and hardly to be digested by the
more sagacious and curious. I must confess I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
wondred at this naming <hi>Antipas</hi> by name, till I
understood a further sense thereof, such as we have
rendred in the Exposition of that Epistle.</p>
               <p>6. In the thirteenth place, One might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
why Christ expresses a greater disgust against
the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> than that of <hi>Sardis.</hi> For
though the former is said to be luke-warm; yet the
other making a great shew of life, is notwithstanding
declared to be dead. That Christ should be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
against Luke-warmness than Hypocrisie, and
threaten it more deeply than the other, <hi>I will spew
thee out of my mouth,</hi> (which is quite to cast a thing
away, never to be resumed again,) must seem mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
to the onsiderate Certainly, if there were not
some greater matter in it, the Spirit of Christ would
not speak so severely onely to follow a Metaphor. But
in the <hi>Prophetical</hi> sense the solution is easy, that
passage being predictive of the Extermination of the
Church from the face of the earth at the close of the
world, as I have expounded it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:59418:204"/>In the fourteenth place, it may be demanded,
why so affectedly and repeatedly in every Epistle
that Phrase is used, <hi>I know thy works,</hi> without any
variation or omission. Which seems a thing but of-small
importance in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense of these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
but in the <hi>Prophetical</hi> it seems on purpose so
repeated, to intimate an Allusion in <hi>Asia</hi> to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
word * (as if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was intended on
purpose to answer to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> * that <hi>Asia</hi> may
also be significant as well as the names of the Seven
Churches: which they all being, it is a shrewd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
this repetition was for some such design as
has been declared. Whereas the <hi>Literal</hi> sense can
give no account thereof.</p>
               <p>Fifteenthly, <hi>Alcazar</hi> himself is much stumbled
that the Spirit of God should be thought to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of any one particular Woman in the Church of
<hi>Thyatira,</hi> and so call her by the name of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> as
is ordinarily supposed. And indeed these things are
too little for the Majesty of this Writing of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse.</hi>
But how can we help it in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense,
if we will interpret with constancy and coherency?
But in the <hi>Prophetical</hi> sense there is no such incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity.
The Object is worth the Spirits taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in this kind; this <hi>Iezabel</hi> being that painted
Woman of <hi>Rome,</hi> intoxicating the Kings of the Earth
with the Cup of her Spiritual Fornications, as has
been shewn upon the Text.</p>
               <p>7. Sixteenthly, It seems very strange that that
Promise of ruling over the Nations, and receiving
the Morning Star, (which doubtless are Political
Promises,) should be made to the Church in <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira,</hi>
more than to that in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> or <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
and others. What Victories or Dominion did the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59418:204"/>
Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> get over the Nations
more than other Churches? This is an hard knot
in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense. But in the <hi>Prophetical</hi> it is
loosened at the first sight. For the Closure of the
Interval of the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> brings in the time
wherein whole Nations revolted from the <hi>Pope</hi> and
his Idolatrous Church, and professed the <hi>Reformed
Religion,</hi> and so in these parts got the Pontifician
party under them.</p>
               <p>Seventeenthly, In the Epistle to the Church in
<hi>Philadelphia</hi> there is mention made of a mighty
Temptation that is to come upon all the World, to
try them that dwell upon the Earth, touching which
he saith, <hi>Behold, I come quickly.</hi> Why should this
be said to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> more than to
any other of the Churches here specified? There
are not the least footsteps of reason to be found in
the <hi>Literal</hi> sense. But in the <hi>Prophetical</hi> sense the
thing is plain. For the Interval of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
in the last Vial, wherein that mighty and
terrible <hi>Earthquake</hi> is to happen, the great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what it is, is plainly thence understood, and
how in respect of this <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church it will
come quickly, she commencing but in the very same
Vial that this is to happen under.</p>
               <p>Eighteenthly, Why upon this <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> a
private <hi>Asiatick</hi> Church, should the name of the
City of God, the <hi>new Ierusalem,</hi> which cometh
down out of Heaven from God, (the very same
that is expressed <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.) be said to be written?
This Title were too big and turgent for any private
Church, were it not a Type or Symbol of some
greater matter. But by the <hi>Prophetical</hi> interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this difficulty is quite removed. For the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59418:205"/>
of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church is coincident with
the times of the <hi>new Ierusalem,</hi> (mentioned at the
end of the <hi>Apocalypse,)</hi> and of the Millennial Empire
of <hi>Christ</hi> upon Earth.</p>
               <p>8. Nineteenthly, The Curious may be prone to
enquire, why the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> in those times
should account her self so hugely and extraordinarily
rich, encreased in goods, and to have no want of
any thing. And truly why this should be her estate
rather than any of the Churches specified, from the
<hi>Literal</hi> ground we can fetch no reason. But admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Prophetical</hi> sense, and that this is the last In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
of the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> it will naturally so
come to pass: For this <hi>Laodicea</hi> will be left Heir to
all the Riches of her Sister <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> to Peace,
Prosperity, Purity in Worship, abundance of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Knowledge, universal skill in the Interpretations
of the Prophecies, and whatever good thing there is
belonging to the Church, saving the Life and Spirit
which <hi>Philadelphia</hi> carried along with her into the
other World. How easily then and naturally, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
necessarily, does this Description of the Church
of <hi>Laodicea</hi> fall upon the last Interval?</p>
               <p>And Lastly, It is a Question extremely obvious
to demand, Why that phrase, * <hi>He that hath an
ear to hear, let him hear,</hi> which our Saviour so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
is found to adde at the end of his Parables to the
People, should be used here so repeatedly in every
Epistle, they being no Parables, but Epistles sent to
each of those Seven Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> respectively:
And then, why this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> is sometimes the
last close of the Epistle, sometimes not? To which
Problem there is no tolerable Solution in the <hi>Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
sense of these Epistles. But supposing a <hi>Mystical</hi>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:59418:205"/>
or <hi>Prophetical</hi> sense, there was a necessity of affixing
this <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> to shew there was a farther sense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
than that of the <hi>Letter:</hi> and also, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> should come last of all, (as in
the four last Epistles,) that the Promise to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
<hi>to him that overcomes,</hi> might be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
understood to be of a proper <hi>Prophetical</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical</hi>
sense, not merely <hi>Theological, Moral</hi> or <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;</hi>
as has been abundantly declared in the <hi>Exposition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. We might have drawn many more Questions
and Solutions from the consideration of the <hi>Letter,</hi>
and of this Hypothesis we go upon, to shew its so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
and fitness, but that we hold it needless, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
produced so many already: which jointly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
with the perpetual easiness and naturalness
of the whole Exposition of all the Epistles, * and the
exact Correspondency of the Names of the Churches
to the Events of the successive Intervals of the true
Catholick Church which they represent, one would
think they should not fail fully to satisfy any unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
Peruser of our <hi>Exposition</hi> of these Epistles,
touching the truth thereof. But I am abundantly
taught by Experience, that both the <hi>finding out,</hi> and
<hi>receiving</hi> of Divine Truths found out by others, is a
special gift of God. And therefore to him alone be
the Glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

from whence he may take shipping to <hi>Patmos</hi>
again to give Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> an account of the delivery

Rivers <hi>Meander</hi> and <hi>Lycus,</hi> which questionless <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>

not, that makes the Names of every one of the
<hi>Seven Churches</hi> to be significant. Nor does <hi>Pega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
that incomparably learned as well as singularly
pious <hi>German,</hi> who knowing nothing of my <hi>Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> nor I of his, gave about
the same time muchwhat the same <hi>Prophetical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
(with Allusions to the Words or Names)
that I have done. Which shews the obviousness and
naturalness of this way of opening the <hi>Prophetical</hi>
sense of these Epistles, to them whose Judgments
are free.</p>
                  <p>And though I knew none, when I set my self to
the <hi>Prophetical Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi>
that held it a Prophecy of the State of the Church
distinguished into so many Intervals from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the end, unless he that put me upon it
might surmise some such thing; yet after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
my <hi>Exposition</hi> I met with one who was
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59418:208"/>something a curious enquirer after Expositours of
the Prophecies of Scripture that named to me at
least half a dozen, that held the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> to
be such a Prophecy, reaching from the beginning of
the Church to the end thereof; and I have had some
such like information since. But none of these that
were of this Opinion had attempted to make the
thing out, as I was informed from the same hands.
And very lately by chance looking again into
Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> I find him also explicitly to declare his
opinion, that the Vision of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> is a
Prophecy touching the Church Universal <hi>à princip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>o
ad finem,</hi> setting out the different states of the
Church in several Intervals in that order that the
<hi>Seven Churches</hi> are ranged in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which
I have noted in my Preface to the <hi>Exposition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he gives two reasons for it, The one that
the Number <hi>Seven</hi> is a Number of <hi>entire Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Time; to which I would adde expresly that,
As the <hi>Seven Seals</hi> reach from the beginning to the
end of the entire <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Period, whose <hi>Epocha</hi>
is the beginning of the Christian Church, and <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
in the end of the World, so doth also the Vision
of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> and that for that reason they
are likewise exhibited under the Number of <hi>Seven.</hi>
His other reason is, That if this <hi>Prophetick</hi> sense
was not intended, the Spirit of Prophecy would not
have pitched upon these <hi>Seven Churches</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> but
the Letters would have been directed either to all the
Churches, or the most famous, such as the Church
at <hi>Antioch,</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and many
others; and such as no doubt, says he, had need of
instruction as well as those named in the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi>
These are his two Arguments which I have not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59418:208"/>in my twenty though I never met with them
before that, in Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> And these two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were sufficient to perswade that Person of so
excellent a wit and judgment, of the truth of the
thing in general. Into how deep a sopor therefore
or lethargy is their wit and judgment cast whom
twenty Arguments of like nature will not awake?</p>
                  <p>But now for a further assurance upon a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account: Which is briefly this, I first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the <hi>Integrum</hi> which was to be distributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these seven parts. Which is the true Apostolick
Church not contaminated with either Pagan or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gano
Christian Idolatry, though living in various cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
from the beginning to the end. Now there
being a complaint of eating things sacrificed unto Idols
under the third and fourth Intervals, and none in the
two first and three last, made me conceive that those
middle Intervals both put together did comprehend
no less space than the times of the Apostasy of the
Church, before whole Kingdomes and Nations had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged
out of it, as it happened at the blessed refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
This is the first fast hold I seemed to have
of things, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and <hi>Thyatirian</hi>
Intervals included the times of the <hi>Apostasy</hi> of the
Church till the Time of <hi>Reformation</hi> came. The
Time antecedent to this was all that Time before the
<hi>Apostasy,</hi> or at least, which I look upon as the more
probable, before the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire became Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
by the <hi>Conversion</hi> of <hi>Constantine.</hi> Now this ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Time is naturally divided into two parts. The
Time before the beginning of the ten persecutions
which began in the tenth of <hi>Nero,</hi> and the Time
from thence to <hi>Constantine,</hi> when the Pagan Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ceased. The former is the <hi>Ephesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>e</hi> Interval, the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59418:209"/>latter the <hi>Smyrnean.</hi> The Persecutions are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the former, executed in the latter. So we
see the order of these four Churches placed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> and known <hi>History.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval naturally follows where
there is no complaint of eating things offered unto I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
as in the two former the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirian</hi>
Intervals, which intimates that the true non-Idolatrizing
Church had now, whenas before she was
but the Woman in the Wilderness, become, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Promise in the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Interval a visible
conspicuous Church and <hi>Polity</hi> of her self got from
under the <hi>Pagano-Christian</hi> Yoke, as well as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church before had got from under the <hi>Pagan.</hi>
Not that this is the best constitution of the Church
that ever will be, though incomparably, or, if you
will, infinitely better than Popery, but that it is
introductory to the Blessed <hi>Millennial</hi> State, when
the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> descends upon Earth, according
to the Prophecies in the <hi>Opened Book.</hi> For now Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
shews the order of these latter Intervals, not
<hi>History,</hi> as being things to come.</p>
                  <p>And it is said expresly to the Church of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi>
I will write upon thee the name of the city of
my God even of the <hi>New Ierusalem.</hi> &amp;c. But now
as in the Visions of the <hi>Opened Book Prophecy</hi> after the
thousand years Satan is let loose, and <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>
besieges the Holy City; so after this excellent <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian</hi>
Interval succeeds the <hi>Laodicean,</hi> who by their
laziness and their luke-warmness will permit <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog</hi> to grow upon them; and as <hi>Fire</hi> from Heaven
puts an end to that Siege, so <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>Laodicea combusta</hi> puts a Period to this Stage of the
Earth together with the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:59418:209"/>So that the account of the placing of the Seven
Churches without any respect to <hi>Paronomastical</hi> Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
you see is steady and orderly and according to
<hi>Time</hi> and <hi>History</hi> for what is <hi>past,</hi> and according to
the Prophecies in the other part of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> for
what is <hi>to come.</hi> Which ordering of them who can
be so stupid as not to acknowledg to be done by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign?
From whence again it will follow that this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> is a Prophecy (properly
so called) of the Condition of the Church from the
beginning to the end.</p>
                  <p>And the same will be still more particularly and
exquisitely proved by the <hi>Paronomastical</hi> Allusions
of the Names of these Churches and other Names
that occurr in the Epistles to the Churches. But as
the former way of Proof I have pursued but sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so I must let this alone altogether, both because
it would take up too much space, whenas my Notes
are swollen to too great a bigness already, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Reader may peruse what I have copiously
enough writ in my <hi>Exposition</hi> it self. I will onely
here take notice that if the <hi>Paronomastical</hi> Allusions
all along from the beginning to the end suit exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely
to the order of Time and Things, as I am well
assured they do; they are also a notable confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or demonstration of the Vis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>
Churches</hi> being a Prophecy, <hi>properly so called,</hi> of the
state of the Church from the beginning to the end;
that it was as ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ainly intended a Prophecy by the
Spirit of God, as the skilfull Structure of the Bodies
of Animals are an assured Argument of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or that Flower-work or Imagery in Carpets
or Clothes made of variously coloured Feathers
(which are things light and slight enough one would
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59418:210"/>think) are an argument of the Art of the <hi>Indians</hi>
that are said to make them. And for my part I
look upon this <hi>Paronomastical</hi> way, let others make
as light and slight of it as they will, to be made use
of on purpose, because as it is, where seriously ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of, a sufficient key of <hi>Revealment,</hi> so it
is here as pleasant a pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e of the Artifice of <hi>Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
from high and lofty Wits, that would be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to stalk over such Allusions with a disdainfull
gate, and overlook them; There being more ways
than one wherein that of the Apostle may be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
That <hi>God has chosen the weak things of the
world to confound the things which are mighty, and
chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the
wise.</hi>
