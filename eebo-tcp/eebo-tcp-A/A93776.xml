            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO whom the Truth of God hath appeared, and hath been made known
amongſt us, in the Light of his beloved Son whom he hath ſent into the
World to diſcover Darkneſs and the wayes of ſin in the hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of the children of men; that ſo all may depart from it, and the

ſhines in their hearts, which is the Standard to try all by, and the Ballance to weigh

all of us to walk by, even the Law of Light, which gives Life and Salvation to all
that believes and therein abide. And this is it, which firſt gathered us together, and
begot deſires in us after the Lords Way, with which our Souls are refreſhed
and our Spirits comforted and conſolated, often in the enioym<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

with our appoynted food; when we have met together to wait upon him in his
Heavenly Way, and bleſſed manifeſtation of Divine Love, He hath filled our hearts
with his Heavenly Dew, and refreſhed us, as with the early and latter raine; and
here the Lords Power we came to feel revea<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

and for us, by the Opperation of his own Eternal Spirit, by which He is cleanſing
his Sanctuary, and making all veſſels fit for the Maſters uſe, for Life to Reign in;
that the Love of God may overflow in all, to the Inviting the Nations, that they
may all walke in the Light of the Lamb and be ſaved; which is and allwayes hath
been our deſire, and that which wee have Breathed unto the Lord for as for our
ſelves, that ſo all may come to the knowledg of the Truth and be ſaved. Wherefore
all <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> minde Gods leading Power in all things whereunto you are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and therein abide with the Lord, anſwering a conſcience voide of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

and Godly Converſation, as becomes the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt amongſt
us all; That ſo God over all may have the Glory and Honour, to whom it belongs
for Evermore.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> for as much as we have ſometimes met together to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of Trades and Callings, but more perticularly of our own, and of which we
are in being Taylors: in which we have met with many trialls on every hand for
many yeares together, though little of it by ſome of us hath been declared, knowing
the Arme and Power of the Lord that ſupported us thorow all, and hath given us a
reward who have ſtood faithful to his requirings, which is our deſire, for all that
are convinced of the Lords Truth, and knowes his Heavenly Way to walk in it;
and where any thing appears to draw back or hinder, to caſt it of, though it be as
the right Hand or the right Eye, yet if it offends pull it out, and caſt it from thee,
and Enjoy Life which is more then all. And this is our deſire for you all that are
our Brethren, who have believed in the Truth, that you keep nothing back that
God calls for: and that you have not Peace in your Imployments, of which we
have ſometimes Diſcourſed, concerning Superfluity, and things alltogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

and that which ſome of us for many yeares have left undone, and we wiſh it were
ſo with all, that there might be a Clearneſs and an inlarge<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

and an Increaſe of his Love, which is much better then the Increaſe of Corne, and
Wine, and Oyle. And theſe things <hi>Friends,</hi> we lay before you in the Love of God,
and in a true ſence of the ſame, as being delivered from under thoſe Burthens, that
many yet groane under, and are not Redeemed out of, a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

as much as in you lies beget them into M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

that they will not deſire, nor weare any thing unconvenient, and therefore need ſay
nothing about it more: Beliveing the Lord will ſo open their Underſtanding, as that
they will Preach to the World in all things, and Adorn <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Goſpel; which is the Power of God, by which we are called, and the way in which
we are to walke, while we are in theſe Earthly Tabernacles; that ſo our Lights
may ſhine forth to the World, that they ſeeing our good workes, may Glorine our
Father which is in Heaven, and that to the Brightneſs of our Riſing, many may
come and ſay, <hi>Come let us go up to the Mountain of the Lords Houſe, even to
the Houſe of the God of Jacob: For he will teach us of his wayes, and we will walk
in his pathes.</hi> And this is that our very Soules Travel for, to God for you all, and
for every one convinced of the Lords Heavenly Truth, that all may enjoy it fully,
and that nothing may be wanting; and for this cauſe is this Written, in the Requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
