            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now for the motiues which first drew me to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the worke, they were diuers: as first, when I saw one man translate and paraphrase most excellently vpon <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils Georgickes,</hi> a worke onely belonging to the Italian climbe, &amp; nothing agreeable with ours another translates <hi>Libault</hi> &amp; <hi>Steuens,</hi> a worke of infinit excellency, yet one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper and naturall to the French, and not to vs: and
<pb facs="tcp:12353:4"/>
another takes collections from <hi>Zenophon,</hi> and others; all forrainers and vtterly vnacquainted with our climbes: when this I beheld, and saw with what good liking they were entertained of all men; and that euery man was dumbe to speake any thing of the <hi>Husbandry</hi> of our owne kingdome, I could not but imagine it a worke most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to men, and most profitable to the kingdome, to set downe the true manner and nature of our right English <hi>Husbandry,</hi> our soyle being as delicate, apt, and fit for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease as any forraine soyle whatsoeuer, and as farre out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going other kingdomes in some commoditie, as they vs in other some. Hence, and from these considerations, I began this worke, of which I haue here sent thee but a small tast, which if I finde accepted, according to mine intent, I will not cease (God permitting mee life) to passe through all manner of English <hi>Husbandry</hi> and <hi>Huswifery</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, without omission of the least scruple that can any way belong to either of their knowledges. Now gentle reader whereas you may be driuen to some amazement, at two titles which insue in the booke, namely, a former part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first, and the first part, you shall vnderstand that those first sheetes were detained both from the Stationer and me, till the booke was almost all printed; and my selfe by extreame sicknesse kept from ouer-viewing the same, wherefore I must intreate your fauour in this impression and the rather in as much as there wanteth neither any of the words or matter whatsoeuer: <hi>Farewell.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common Adage in our English spéech, that a man gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally séene in all things can bée particularly perfect or compleate in none: Which Prouerbe there is no question will both by the curious and enuious be heauily imposed vpon my backe, because in this, and other workes, I haue delt with many things of much importance, and such as any one of them would require a whole liues experience, whereas neither my Birth, my Education, nor the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall course of my life can promise no singularitie in any part of those Artes they treate of: but for suggestions (the liberty whereof the wisedome of Kings could neuer bridle) let them poison themselues with their

               <p>Besides, I am not altogether vnséene in these misce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I write of: for it is well knowne I followed the profession of a Husbandman so long my selfe, as well might make mee worthy to be a graduate in the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: wherein my simplicitie was not such but I both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued well those which were estéemed famous in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and preserued to my selfe those rules which I found infallible by experience. <hi>Virgill</hi> was an excellent Poet, and a seruant, of trusty account, to <hi>Augustus,</hi> whose court and study-imployments would haue said he should haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knowledge in rurall businesse, yet who hath set downe more excellently the manner of Italian Husbandry then himselfe, being a perfect lanthorne, from whose light both Italic and other countries haue séene to trace into the true path of profit and frugallitie? <hi>Steuens</hi> and <hi>Libault,</hi> two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Phisitions, a profession that neuer medleth with the Plough, yet who hath done more rarely<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Husbandman is he to whom God in the scriptures giueth many blessings, for his labours of all other are most excellent, and therefore to be a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman is to be a good man; whence the auntients did baptise, and wée euen to this day doe seriously obserue to call euery Husbandman, both in our ordinary conference and euery particular salutation, goodman such a one, a title (if wée rightly obserue it) of more honour and vertuous note, then many which precede it at feasts and in gaudy places.</p>

either with some pretty groues, of tall young spiers, or else with rowes of greater timber, which besids the pleasure and profit thereof (hauing mode of neare a mans dore) the shelter will be most excellent to kéepe off the bleaknesse of the sharpe stormes and tempests in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and be an excellent worme stall for cattell in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. This house would be planted, if possible, neare to some riuer, or fresh running brooke, but by no meanes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the verge of the riuer, nor within the danger of the ouerflow thereof: for the one is subiect to too much cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and moisture, the other to danger. You shall plant the face, or forefront, of your house vpon the rising of the Sunne, that the vigor of his warmth may at no time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from some part thereof, but that as he riseth on the oneside so he may set on the other.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F a workeman of any trade, or mistery, cannot giue directions how, and in what manner, the tooles where with he worketh should be made or fashioned, doubtlesse hée shall neuer worke well with them, nor know when they are in temper and when out. And so it fareth with the Husbandman, for if hée
<pb facs="tcp:12353:8"/>
know not how his Plough should be made, nor the seuerall members of which it consisteth, with the vertue and vse of euery member, it is impossible that euer hée should make a good furrow, or turne ouer his ground in Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner: Therefore that euery Husbandman may know how a well shaped Plough is made, he shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the first member thereof, as being the strongest and most principallest péece of timber belonging to the same, is called the Plough-beame, being a large long péece of timber much bending, according to the forme of this figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>This beame hath no certaine length nor thicknesse, but is proportioned according to the ground, for if it be for a clay ground the length is almost seauen foote, if for any other mixt or lighter earth, then fiue or sixe foote is long inough.</p>
               <p>The second member or part of the Plough, is called the skeath, and is a péece of woode of two foote and a halfe in length, and of eight inches in breadth, and two inches in thicknesse: it is driuen extreamly hard into the Plough-beame, slopewise, so that ioyned they present this figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12353:9"/>The third part is called the Ploughes principall hale, and doth belong to the left hand being a long bent péece of woode, some what strong in the midst, and so slender at the vpper end that a man may easily gripe it, which being fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the rest presenteth this figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The fourth part is the Plough head, which must be fixed with the skeath &amp; the head all at one instant in two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall mortisse holes: it is a flat péece of timber, almost thrée foote in length if it be for clay ground, otherwise shorter, of breadth seauen inches, and of thicknesse too inches and a halfe, which being ioyned to the rest presenteth this figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12353:9"/>The fift part is the Plough spindels, which are two small round péeces of woode, which coupleth together the hales, as in this figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The sixt part is the right hand hale, through which the other end of the spindels runne, and is much slenderer then the left hand hale, for it is put to no force, but is onely a stay and aide to the Plough houlder when hee cometh in heauy, stiffe, and strong worke, and being ioyned with the rest presenteth this figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12353:10"/>The seauenth part is the Plough-rest, which is a small péece of woode, which is fixt at one end in the further nicke of the Plough head, and the other end to the Ploughs right-hand hale, as you may sée by this figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The eight part is called the shelboard, and is a broad board of more then an inche thicknesse, which couereth all the right side of the Plough, and is fastned with two strong pinnes of woode through the skeath, and the right-hand hale, according to this figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12353:10"/>The ninth part is the coulture, which is a long péece of Iron, made sharpe at the neather end, and also sharpe on one side and being for a stiffe clay it must be straight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bending, which passeth by a mortisse-hole through the beame, and to this coulture belongeth an Iron ring, which windeth about the beame and kéepeth it in strength from breaking as may appeare by this figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The tenth part of a compleate Plough, is the share; which is fixed to the Plough head, and is that which cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and turneth vp the earth: if it be for a mixt earth then it is made without a wing, or with a very small one, but if it be for a déepe, or stiffe clay, then it is made with a large wing, or an outward point, like the figure following.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The eleauenth part of a perfect Plough is called the Plough foote, and is through a mortisse-hole fastned at the farre end of all the beame with a wedge or two, so as the Husbandman may at his discretion set it higher or lower, at his pleasure: the vse of it is to giue the Plough earth, or put it from the earth, as you please, for the more you driue it downeward, the more it raiseth the beame from the ground, and maketh the Irons forsake the earth, and the more you driue it vpward the more it letteth downe the beame, and so maketh the Irons bite the sorer; the figure whereof is this.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Thus haue you all the parts and members of a Plough, and how they be knit and ioyned together, wherein I would wish you to obserue to make your Plough-wright
<pb facs="tcp:12353:11"/>
euer rather giue your Plough land then put her from the land, that is, rather leaning towards the earth and biting sore, then euer slipping out of the ground: for if it haue two much earth the Husbandman may help it in the houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but if it haue too little, then of necessitie it must make foule worke: but for as much as the error and amends lye both in the office of the Plough-wright, I will not trouble the Husbandman with the reformation thereof.</p>
               <p>Now you shall vnderstand that there is one other thing belonging to the Plough, which albe it be no member thereof, yet is it so necessary that the Husbandman which liueth in durty and stiffe clayes can neuer goe to Plough without it, and it is called the Aker-staffe, being a pretty bigge cudgell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Plough is to a Husbandman like an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument in the hand of a Musition, which if it be out of tune can neuer make good Musicke, and so if the Plough, being out of order, if the Husbandman haue not the cunning to temper it and set it in the right way, it is impossible that euer his labour should come to good end.</p>
               <p>It is very necessary then that euery good Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man know that a Plough being perfectly well made, the good order or disorder thereof consisteth in the placing of the Plough-Irons and the Plough-foote. Kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w then, that for the placing of the Irons, the share would be set to looke a little into the ground: and because you shall not bruise, or turne, the point thereof, you shall knocke it fast vpon the head, either with a crooked Rams-horne, or else with some piece of soft Ash-woode: and you shall obserue that it stand plaine, flat, and leuell, without wrying or turning either vpward or downeward: for if it runne not euen vpon the earth it will neuer make a good furrow, onely as before I said, the point must looke a little downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Now, for the coulture, you must place it flopewise through the beame, so as the point of it and the point of the share may as it were touch the ground at one instant, yet if the coulture point be a little thought the longer it shall not be amisse: yet for a more certaine direction and to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Irons stand true I or no, you shall take a string, and measure from the mortisse-hole through which the coulture passeth, to the point of the coulture, and so kéeping your vpper hand constant lay the same length to
<pb facs="tcp:12353:12"/>
the of point your share, and if one measure serue them both right, there being no difference betwéene them, then the Irons stand true for their length, otherwise they stand false.</p>
               <p>Now your coulture albe it stand true for the length, yet it may stand either too much to the land, or too much from the land, either of which is a great errour, and will kéepe the Plough from going true: your coulture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall haue certaine wedges of ould dry Ash woode, that is to say, one before the coulture on the vpper side the beame, and another on the land side, or left side, the coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the vpper side the beame also; then you shall haue another wedge behinde the coulture vnderneath the beame, and one on the furrow side, or right side, the beame vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath also. Now, if your coulture haue too much land, then you shall driue in your vpper side wedge and ease the contrary: if it haue too little land, then you shall contrarily driue in your right side vnder wedge and ease the other: If your coulture stand too forward, then you shall driue in your vpper wedge which standeth before the coulture; and if it stand too backward and too néere your share, then you shall driue in your vnder wedge which standeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the coulture: if your coulture standeth awry any way, then are either your side wedges too small, or else not euen and plainecut, which faults you must amend, and then all will be perfect. Now, when your Irons are iust and truely placed, then you shall driue in euery wedge hard and firme, that no shaking or other straine may loosen them: as for the Plough foote it also must haue a wedge or two, which when your Plough goeth right and to your contentment (for the foote will kéepe it from sinking or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing) then you shall also driue them in hard, that the foote may not stirre from the true place where you did set it. And that these things when a man commeth into the field may not be to séeke, it is the office of euery good Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man neuer to goe forth with his Plough but to haue his Hatchet in a socket, fixt to his Plough beame, and a good

very blewish, with many white vaines in it, which is a very speciall note to know his fruitfulnesse; for that blewish earth mixt with white is nothing else but very rich Marle, an earth that in Cheshire, Lanckashire, and many other countries, serueth to Manure and make fat their barrainest land in such sort that it will beare Corne seauen yéeres together. This blacke clay as it is the best soyle, well Husbanded, so it is of all soyles the worst if it be ill Husbanded: for if it loose but one ardor, or seasonable Plowing, it will not be recouered in foure yéeres after, but will naturally of it selfe put forth wilde Oates, Thistels, and all manner of offensiue wéedes, as Cockle, Darnell, and such like: his labour is strong, heauy, and sore, vnto the cattell that tilleth it, but to the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is more easie then any other soyle, for this asketh but foure times Plowing ouer at the most, where diuers other soyles aske fiue times, and sixe times, as shalbe shewed hereafter. But to come to the Plowing of this soyle, I hold it méete to beginne with the beginning of the yéere, which with Husbandmen is at Plow-day, being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the first Munday after the Twelft-day, at which time you shall goe forth with your draught, &amp; begin to plow your Pease-earth, that is, the earth where you meane to sow your Pease, or Beanes: for I must giue you to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that these Clayes are euer more naturall for Beanes then Pease, not but that they will beare both alike, only the Husbandman imployeth them more for Beanes, because pease &amp; fitches wil grow vpon euery soyle, but Beanes wil grow no where but on the clayes onely. This Pease-earth is euer where barley grew the yéere before, &amp; hath the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yet remayning thereon. You shal plow this Pease-earth euer vpward, that is, you shall beginne on the ridge of the land, &amp; turne all your furrowes vp, one against another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your lands lye too high (which seldome can be séene) and then you shall begin at the furrow, &amp; cast downe your land.</p>
               <p>Now, when you haue plowed all your Pease-ground, you shall let it so lye, till it haue receiued diuers Frosts,
<pb facs="tcp:12353:14"/>
some Raine, and then a fayre season, which betwixt plow-day and Saint <hi>Valentines</hi> day you shalbe sure to inioy: and this is called, <hi>The letting of Land lye to baite:</hi> for without this rest, and these seasons, it is impossible to make these Clayes harrow, or yéelde any good mould at all. After your Land hath receiued his kindely baite, then you shall cast in your séede, of Beanes, or Pease: but in my conceit, an equall mixture of them is the best séede of all, for if the one faile, the other will be sure to hit: and when your land is sowne you shall harrow it with a harrow that hath woodden téeth.</p>
               <p>The next Ardor after this, is the sowing of your Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in your fallow field: the next is the fallowing of your ground for Barley the next yéere: the next Ardor is the Summer-stirring of that which you fallowed: the next is the foyling of that which you Summer-stirde: and the last is the Winter rigging of that which you soil'd: of all which Ardors, and the manner of Plowing them, with their seasons, I haue written sufficiently in the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the next part; where I speake of simple earths vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compounded.</p>
               <p>Now whereas I told you before that these clayes were heauy worke for your Cattell, it is necessary that I shew you how to ease them, and which way they may draw to their most aduantage, which onely is by drawing in beare-geares, an inuention the skilfull Husbandman hath found out, wherein foure horses shall draw as much as sixe, and sixe as eight, being geard in any other contrary fashion.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW as touching the white or gray clay, you shall vnderstand that it is of diuers and sundry natures, altering according to his tempers of wet or drynesse: the wet being more tough, and the dry more brittle: his mixture and other characters I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a former Chapter, wherefore for his manner of plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (obseruing my first methode, which is to beginne with the beginning of the yéere, I meane at Christmas) it is thus:</p>
               <p>If you finde that any of this white or gray clay,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of sowing of Pease and Beanes.</hi>
                  </note> lying wet, haue lesse mixture of stone or chaulke in it, and so consequently be more tough, as it doth many times fall out, and that vpon such land, that yéere, you are to sow your Pease and Beanes: for as in the former blacke clay, so in this gray clay you shall begin with your Pease-earth euer: then immediately after Plow-day, you shall plow vp such ground as you finde so tough, in the selfe-same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as you did plow the blacke clay, and so let it lye to baite till the frost haue seasoned it, and then sow it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. But if you haue no such tough land, but that it holdes it owne proper nature, being so mixt with small stones and chaulke, that it will breake in reasonable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then you shall stay till the latter end of Ianuary, at what time, if the weather be seasonable, and inclining to drynesse, you shall beginne to plow your Pease-earth, in this manner: First, you shall cause your séedes-man to sow the land with single casts, as was shewed vpon the blacke clay, with this caution, that the greater your séede is, (that is, the more Beanes you sow) the greater must be your quantitie: and being sowne, you shall bring your plough,
<pb facs="tcp:12353:17"/>
and beginning at the furrow of the land, you shall plow euery furrow downeward vpon the Pease and Beanes: which is called sowing of Pease vnder furrow: and in this manner you shall sow all your Pease and Beanes, which is cleane contrary to your blacke clay. Besides, whereas vpon the stiffe clay it is conuenient to take as large fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes as you please, vpon this kinde of gray clay you shall take as small furrowes as is possible. Now the reason for this manner of plowing your Pease-earth, is, because it is a light kinde of breaking earth, so that should it be sowne according to the stiffe blacke clay, it would neuer couer your Pease, but leaue them bare, both to be destroyed by the Fowles of the ayre, and the bitternesse of the weather. As soone as your Pease and Beanes are risen a fingers length aboue the earth, then if you finde that any of your lands doe lye very rough, and that the clods be great, it shall not be amisse, to take a payre of woodden Harrowes, and harrow ouer all your rough lands, the benefit whereof is this, that it will both breake the hard clots, and so giue those Pease leaue to sprout through the earth, which before lay bound in and drowned, and also lay your lands smooth and cleane, that the Mowers when they come to mowe your Pease and Beanes, shall haue better worke, and mowe them with more ease, and much better to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners profit. For you must vnderstand that where you sow Beanes, there it is euer more profit to mowe them with Sythes, then to reape them with Hookes, and much sooner, and with lesse charge performed. The limitation of time for this Ardor of earing, is from the latter end of Ianuary vntill the beginning of March, not forgetting this rule, that to sow your Pease and Beanes in a shower, so it be no beating raine is most profitable: because they, as Wheat, take delight in a fresh and a moyst mould.</p>

                  </note>After the beginning of March, you shall beginne to sow your Barley vpon that ground which the yéere before did lye fallow, and is commonly called your tilth, or fallow field: and if any part of it consist of stiffe and tough ground,
<pb facs="tcp:12353:17"/>
then you shall, vpon such ground, sow your Barley vnder furrow, in such manner and fashion as I described vnto you for the sowing of your stiffe blacke clay: but if it be (as for the most part these gray and white clayes are) of a much lighter, and as it were, fussie temper, then you shall first plow your land vpward, cleane and well, without ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>kes or stiches: and hauing so plowed it, you shall then sow it with Barley, that is to say, with double casts, I meane, bestowing twise so many casts of Barley, as you would doe if you were to sow it with Pease. And as soone as you haue sowne your Barley, you shall take a payre of wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Harrowes, and harrow it as small as is possible: and this is called sowing aboue furrow.</p>
               <p>Now if you haue any land,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of sowing Oates.</hi>
                  </note> which eyther through the badnesse of the soyle, or for want of manure, is more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne, and hard to bring forth then generally the rest of your land is, then you shall not bestow Barley thereupon, but sow it with Oates, in such manner and fashion as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the sowing of Pease, that is to say, if it be stiffe ground you shall sow it aboue furrow, if it be light ground, then you shall sow it vnder furrow, knowing this for a rule, that the barraynest ground will euer beare indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Oates, but if the ground haue any small hart, then it will beare Oates in great abundance: neither néede you to be very precise for the oft plowing of your ground before you sow your Oates, because Oates will grow very well if they be sowne vpon reasonable ground, at the first plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: whence it comes to passe that many Husbandmen doe oft sow their Oates where they should sow their Pease, and in the same manner as they doe sow their Pease, and it is held for a rule of good husbandry also: because if the ground be held any thing casuall for Pease, it is better to haue good Oates then naughty Pease: besides, your Oates are both a necessary graine in the house, as for Oate-meale, for the pot, for Puddings, and such like, and also for the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for Prouender, and the féeding of all manner of Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The time for sowing of your Barley and Oates, is
<pb facs="tcp:12353:18"/>
from the first of March till the first of Aprill, obseruing euer to sow your Oates first, and your Barley after, for it being onely a Summer graine, would participate as little as may be with any part of the Winter.</p>

                  </note>About the middest of Aprill you shall beginne to fallow that part of your ground, which you entend shall take rest that yéere, and so become your fallow or tilth-field. And in fallowing this gray or white clay, you shall obserue all those rules and ceremonies, which are formerly described for the fallowing of the stiffe blacke clay, knowing that there is in this worke no difference betwéene the blacke clay, and the gray clay, but both to be plowed after one manner, that is to say, to haue all the furrowes cast downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the ridges of the lands laid largely open, and of a good depth, onely the furrowes which you turne vpon this gray clay must be much smaller and lesse then those which you turne vpon your stiffe blacke clay, because this earth is more naturally inclined to binde and cleaue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then that of the blacke clay. The time for fallowing of this ground, is from the middest of Aprill vntill the middest of May: at what time you shall perceiue your Barley to appeare aboue the ground, so that then you shall beginne to sleight and smooth it:<note place="margin">

                  </note> but not with backe Harrowes, as was described for the blacke clay, because this gray clay being not so fat and rich, but more inclined to fastnesse and hardnesse, therefore it will not sunder and breake so easily as the other: wherefore when you will smooth or sleight this ground, you shall take a round piece of wood, being in compasse about at least thirty inches, and in length sixe foote, hauing at each end a strong pinne of Iron, to which making fast two small poales, by which the horse shall draw, yet in such sort that the round piece of wood may roule and turne about as the horse drawes it: and with this you shall roule ouer all your Barley, and by the waight of the round piece of wood bruise and breake all the hard clots asunder. This is called amongst Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men a Rouler, and is for this purpose of sleighting and
<pb facs="tcp:12353:18"/>
smoothing of grounds of great vse and profit. Now you shall vnderstand that you must not at any time sleight or smooth your Corne, but after a shower of Raine, for if the mould be not a little moistned the rouler will not haue power to breake it.</p>
               <p>Now for as much as this rouler is of so good vse and yet not generally vsed in this kingdome, I thinke it not amisse to shew you the figure thereof.</p>

               <p>Now albe I haue omitted the Manuring of this land in his due place,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of Manuring</hi>
                  </note> as namely, from the midst of Aprill, till the end of May, yet you shall vnderstand that of all other things it is not in any wise to be neglected by the carefull Husbandman, both because the soyle being not so rich as the blacke Clay, will very hardly bring forth his séede without Manure, and also because it is for the most part subiect vnto much wet, and stones, both which are signes of cold and barrainenesse. Now for those Manures, which are best and most proper for this soile, you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that all those which I formerlie described for the blacke Claies, as namely, Oxe or Cowes dung, Horse dung and Shéepes dung, are also very good for this soile, and to be vsed in the same manner as is specified in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter: but if you haue not such store of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure as will serue to compasse your whole land, you shall then vnderstand, that the blacke mud, or durt which lies
<pb facs="tcp:12353:20"/>
in the bottome of olde ponds, or else standing lakes, is also a very good manure for this soile, or else straw which is spread in high-wayes, and so rotted by the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course or vse of much trauelling, and after in the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time shouelled vp in great heapes, is a good manure for this earth: but if you finde this soile to be subiect to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wet and coldnesse, you shall then know that the ashes eyther of wood, coale, or straw, is a very good manure for it. But aboue all other, and then which there is no manure more excellent for cold barraine clayes of this nature, the Pigions dung, or the dung of houshold Pullen, as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, Hennes, Chickens, Turkies, and such like, so there be no Goose-dung amongst it, is the best of all other: but not to be vsed in such sort as the other manures, that is to say, to be laid in great heapes vpon the land, or to be spread from the Cart vpon the land, for neyther is there such abundance of such manure to be gotten, nor if there were, it would not be held for good husbandrie to make lauish ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke of a thing so precious.</p>

This manure is of the same nature that shéepes manure is, and doth last but onely for one yéere, onely it is much hotter, as being in the greatest extremitie of heate.

his force of increasing, in this case it is best to lay your lands flat and leuell, without ridges or furrowes, as is done in many parts of Cambridge-shire, some parts of Essex, and some parts of Hartford-shire: but if the clay be fruitfull and of good temper, yet either by the bordering of great hils, the ouer-flow of small brookes, or some other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall meanes it is subiect to much wet or dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if the land be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, colde, wet, subiect to much binding, and doth bring forth great store of wéedes, then you shall lay your land in little stiches, that is to say, not aboue thrée or foure fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes at the most together, as is generally séene in Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesex, Hartford-shire, Kent and Surrey: for by that meanes neither shall the land binde and choake the Corne, nor shall the wéede so ouer-runne it, but that the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may with good ease helpe to strengthen and clense it, the many furrowes both giuing him many passages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may correct those enormities, and also in such sort conuaying away the water and other moistures, that there cannot be made any land more fruitfull.</p>

                     <hi>Of the Plough.</hi>
                  </note>Now to speake of the Plough which is best and most proper for this gray or white clay, of which we now speake, you shall vnderstand that it differeth excéeding much from that of which we spake concerning the blacke clay: I, and in such sort, that there is but small alliance or affinitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them: as thus for example:</p>
               <p>First, it is not so large and great as that for the blacke clay: for the head thereof is not aboue twentie inches in length, and not aboue one inch and a halfe in thicknesse, the maine beame thereof is not aboue fiue foot long, &amp; the rest is broader by an inch and more then that for the blacke clay: this Plough also hath but one hale, &amp; that is onely the left hand Hale: for the Plough-staffe, or Aker-staffe serueth euer in stead of the right hand Hale, so that the Rough-staues
<pb facs="tcp:12353:21"/>
are fixed, the vpper vnto the shelboard, and the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto the Plough-rest, as for your better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you may perceiue by this figure.</p>
               <figure>
                  <head>The Plough with one Hale.</head>
               </figure>
               <p>Now you shall vnderstand that the especiall care which is to be held in the making of this Plough, is, that it be wide and open in the hinder part, that it may turne and lay the furrowes one vpon another: whereas if it should be any thing straitned in the hinder part, considering that this clay naturally is somewhat brittle of it selfe, and that the furrowes which you plow must of necessitie be very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and little, it were not possible so to lay them, but that they would fall downe backe againe, and inforce the Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to lose his labour. Also you shall vnderstand that whereas in the former plough, which is for the blacke clay, you may turne the shelboard, that is, when the one end is worne, you may eftsoones turne the other, and make it serue the like season: in this Plough you must neuer turne the shelboard, because the rising wing of the Share will so defend it, that it will euer last as long as the Plough-head, without change or turning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12353:22"/>Now for the Irons belonging vnto this Plough, which is the Share and Coulture, there is more difference in them then in the Plough: for to speake first of the Share, whereas the former Share for the blacke clay, was made broad, plaine, and with a large wing, this Share must be made narrow, sharpe, and small, with no wing at all, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from the vpper part thereof, close by the shelboard, a certaine rising wing, or broad piece of Iron, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vp and arming that part of the shelboard which turnes ouer the land, defends the wood from the sharpe mould, which hauing the mixture of pible stone in it, would otherwise in lesse then one dayes worke consume the shelboard vnto nothing, forcing the Plow-man to much trouble and double cost. The fashion of the Share is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in this Figure following.</p>
               <figure>
                  <head>The Share.</head>
               </figure>
               <p>This Share is onely made that it may take a small fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and so by breaking the earth oftner then any other Share, causeth the land to yéeld a good and plentifull mould, and also kéepe it from binding or choaking the séede when it is cast into it.</p>
               <p>Now for the Coulture, it differeth from the former Coulture both in breadth and thicknesse, but especially in compasse: for whereas the former Coulture for the blacke clay, was made straight, narrow, and thicke, this must be compassed like an halfe bent bow: it must be broader then thrée fingers, and thinner then halfe an inche, according to this Figure.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Now when these Irons, the Shelboard, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements are fixed vnto the Plough, you shall perceiue that the Plough will carry the proportion of this Figure following.</p>

               <p>Hauing thus shewed you the substance, difference, and contraries of these two Ploughs, which belong to these two seuerall clayes, the blacke and gray, you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that there is no clay-groud whatsoeuer, which is without other mixture, but one of these Ploughs will suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently serue to eare and order it: for all clayes are of one of these tempers.</p>
               <p>Now for the vse and manner of handling or holding this Plough,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The vse and handling.</hi>
                  </note> it differeth nothing in particular obseruation from
<pb facs="tcp:12353:23"/>
the vse and handling of the Plough formerly described, more then in the largenesse and smalnesse of the furrowes: for as before I said, whereas the blacke clay must be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a great furrow, and a broad stitch, this gray clay must be raised with a small furrow, and a narrow stitch: and although this plough haue nothing but a left hand Hale, yet considering the Plough-staffe, vpon which the Plow-man resteth his right hand, it is all one as if he had a right. And indéede, to make your knowledge the more perfect, you shall know that these gray clayes are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in their owne natures so wet, tough, and slimy, and doe so clogge, cleaue, and choake vp the Plough, that hée which holds it shall haue enough to doe with his right hand onely to clense and kéepe the Plough from choaking, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that if there were another Hale, yet the Plow-man should haue no leasure to hold it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ext vnto these Clayes, which are soiles sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and vncompound, as being perfect in their owne natures, without the helpe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mixtures, I place the Sand soiles, as being of like qualitie, not borrowing any thing but from their owne natures, nor brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any defects more then their owne naturall imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and of Sands, sith the red Sand is the best and most fruitfull, therefore it is fit that it take prioritie of place, and be here first spoken of.</p>
               <p>You shall then vnderstand that this red Sand, albeit it is the best of Sands, yet it is the worst of many soiles, as being of it selfe of such a hot and drie nature, that it scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the séede, and dryeth vp that nutriment and fatnesse which should occasion increase: whereby it comes to passe, that the Barley which growes vpon this red Sand is euer more yealow, leane and withered, then that which growes vpon the clayes or other mixt earths. This Sand especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally taketh delight in Rye, because it is a Graine which loues warmth aboue all other, and yet notwithstanding, if it be well ordered, manured and plowed, it will bring forth good store of Barley, albeit the Barley be not so good as Clay-Barley, either for the colour, or for the yéeld, whether it be in meale or in Malt.</p>
               <p>Now for the manner of Earing or plowing this redde Sand, it differeth much from both the former soyles, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that for your better vnderstanding, I must in many places alter my former methode, yet so little as may be, because I am loath to alter or clogge the memory of the Reader: wherefore to pursue my purpose.

For this Sand-soile being hot, drie, and light, will neither bring forth good Beanes nor good Pease, and therefore that Ardor is in this place but onely to be spoke of by way of discourse in vrgent necessitie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (as before I said) about the middest of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary you shall beginne to lay fallow that field, where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did grow your Rye, the manner of plowing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of differeth nothing from the manner of plowing the clayes before written of, onely that the discretion of the Plow-man must thus farre forth gouerne him, that in as much as this soile is lighter, dryer, and of a more loose temper, by so much the more he must be carefull to make his furrowes lesse, and to lay them the closer together: &amp; also in as much as this soile, through his naturall warmth and temperate moisture, is excéeding apt to bring forth much wéede, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Brakes, Ling, Brambles, and such like, therefore the Plow-man shall be very carefull to plow all his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes very cleane, without baukes or other impediments by which may be ingendred any of these inconueniences.</p>

Now whereas I spake of the Horse-harrow and the Oxe-harrow, it is to be vnderstood that the single Harrow doth belong to the Horse, because Horses drawing single, doe draw each a seuerall Harrow by himselfe, albeit in the common vse of harrowing, we cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple two horses euer together, and so make them draw two single Harrowes: but Oxen not being in good Husbandry to be separated, because euer two must draw in one yoake, therefore was the double Harrow deuised, containing in substance and worke as much as two single Harrowes.</p>

And herein is to be vnderstood, that the best and principallest Manure for this redde-sand, is the ouldest Manure of beasts which can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, which you shall know by the excéeding blacknesse and rottennesse thereof, being in the cutting both soft and smooth, all of one substance, as if it were well compact morter, without any shew of straw or other stuffe which is vnrotted, for this dung is of all the fattest and coolest, and doth best agrée with the nature of this hot sand. Next to the dung of beasts, is the dung of Horses if it be old also, otherwise it is somewhat of the hottest, the rubbish of old houses, or the swéepings of flowres, or the scowrings of old Fish-ponds, or other standing waters where beasts and horses are vsed to drinke, or be washt, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the water and moisture of dunghills haue recourse are all good Manures for this redde-sand: as for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of Shéepe vpon this redde-sand, it is the best of all in such places as you meane to sow Rie, but not fully so good where you doe intend to sow your Barley: if it be a cold moist redde-sand (which is seldome found but in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular low countries) then it doth not amisse to Manure it most with Shéepe, or else with Chaulke, Lime, or Ashes, of which you can get the greatest plentie: if this soile be subiect to much wéede and quickes, as generally it is, then after you haue torne vp the wéedes and quickes with Harrowes, you shall with rakes, rake them together, and laying them in heapes vpon the land, you shall burne them and then spreading the ashes they will be a very good Manure, and in short space destroy the wéedes also;
<pb facs="tcp:12353:27"/>
likewise if your land be much ouergrowne with wéedes, if when you sheare your Rie you leaue a good long stubble, and then mowing the stubble burne it vpon the land, it is both a good Manure and also a good meanes to destroy the wéedes.</p>

These Grauels are both, in generall, subiect to much barrainnesse, espcially if they be accompanied with any extraordinary moisture, yet with the good labour of plowing, and with the cost of much Manure, they are
<pb facs="tcp:12353:34"/>
brought to reasonable fruitfulnesse, where it comes to passe that the Plow-man which is master of such a soile, if either he liue not neare some Citie or Market-towne, where great store of Manure, by the concourse of people, is daily bred, and so consequently is very cheape, or else haue not in his owne store and bréede, meanes to raise good store of Manure, hée shall seldome thriue and prosper thereupon. Now although in these grauell soiles there is a diuersity of mixture, as the one mingled with small Pibles, which indéede is the worst mixture, the other with broad Flints, which is the better signe of fruitfulnesse: yet in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of tillage or Earings, in their wéeding and cleansing, and in all other ardors and obseruations, they differ nothing at all, the beginning and ending of each seuerall worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all one.</p>

Secondly, you shall not goe about to gather off the stones which séeme as it were to couer the lands, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the labour is infinite and impossible, as also because

So that the consequence being considered, this ground is not but to be held indifferent fruitfull: for whereas other soiles afore shewed (which beare abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Graine) are bound to be manured once in thrée yéeres, this soile, albe it beare neither so rich graine, nor so much plenty, yet it néedes marling not aboue once in six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene or eightéene yéeres: and albe Marle be a Manure of the greatest cost, yet the profit by continuance is so equall that the labour is neuer spent without his reward, as shall more largely appeare hereafter.</p>

And for as much as the best and principallest part of Husbandry consisteth in the plowing and earring of the ground (for in that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Adam</hi> began his first labours) I thinke it not vnméete, first to treate of that subiect, procéeding so from braunch to braunch, till I haue giuen euery one sufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>To speake then first of the Tilling of Grounds. You shall well vnderstand, that it is the office of euery good Husbandman before he put his plough into the earth, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to consider the nature of his Grounds, and which is of which quallitie and temper. To procéede then to our purpose; all soyles what soeuer, in this our kingdome of England, are reduced into two kindes onely, that is to say, Simple or Compound. Simple, are those which haue no mixture with others of a contrary quallitie, as are your stiffe clayes, or your loose sands: your stiffe clayes are likewise diuers, as a blacke clay, a blew clay, and a clay like vnto Marble. Your sands are also diuers, as a red sand, a white sand, a yellow sand, and a sand like vnto dust. Your mixt earths are where any of these clayes and sands are equally or vnindifferently mixed together, as shalbe at large declared hereafter. Now as touching the tilling of your simple clayes, it is to be noted, that the blacke clay, of all earth, is the most fruitfull, and demandeth from the Husbandman the least toyle, yet bringeth forth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in the greatest abundance: it will well and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12353:40"/>
bring forth thrée crops, eare it desire rest: namely, the first of Barly, the second of Pease, and the third of Wheate: It doth not desire much Manure, for it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of it selfe so fat, rich, and fruitfull, that if you adde strength vnto his strength, by heaping Manure or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe thereupon, you make it either blast, and mildew the Corne that growes, with the too much fatnesse of the earth, or else through his extreame rankenesse, to bring it vp in such abundance that it is not able to stand vpright when it is shot vp, but falling downe flat to the ground, and the eares of Corne smothering one another, they bring forth nothing but light Corne, like an emptie huske, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a kirnell. The best Manure or Compasse therefore that you can giue such ground, is then to plow it in orderly and dew seasons, as thus: you shall begin to fallow, or breake vp this soyle, at the beginning of May, at which time you shall plow it déepe, &amp; take vp a large furrow, and if your Lands lye any thing flat, it shalbe méete that you begin on the ridge of the land, and turne all your furrowes vpward, but if your Lands lye high and vpright, then shall you begin in the furrow and turne all your furrowes downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which is called of Husbandmen, the casting downe of Land. This first plowing of ground, or as Husbandmen tearme it, the first ardor, is called fallowing: the second ardor, which we call stirring of ground, or sommer stirring, you shall begin in Iuly, which is of great consequence, for by meanes of it you shall kill all manner of wéedes and thistells that would annoy your Land. In this ardor you must oft obserue that if when you fallowed you did set vp your Land, then now when you stirre you must cast downe your Land, and so contrarily, if before you did cast downe, then now you must set vp: your third ardor, which is called of Husbandmen, winter ridgeing, or setting vp Land for the whole yéere, you shall begin at the latter end of September, and you must euer obserue that in this third ardor you doe alwaies ridge vp your Land, that is to say, you most turne euery furrow vpward and

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12353:43"/>
Husbandly fashion, neither will the white clay mixt with red sand indure to be deuided into foure fields, that is to say, to beare thrée seuerall crops, one after another, as namely, Barly, Pease, and Wheat, without rest, which the blacke clay mixt with white sand many times doth, and thereby againe showeth his better fruitfulnesse: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, in generalitie I would not wish any good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, and especially such as haue much tillage, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide either of these soyles into any more then thrée fields, both because hee shall case himselfe and his Cattell of much toyle, shall not at any time loose the best seasons for his best workes, and make his commodities, and fruit of his hands labours, by many degrées more certaine.</p>
               <p>You shall also vnderstand, that both these soyles are very much binding, especially the white clay with red sand, both because the clay, procéeding from a chaukie and limie substance, and not hauing in it much fatnesse or fertillitie (which occasioneth seperation) being mixt with the red sand, which is of a much more hardnesse and aptnesse to knit together, with such tough matter, it must necessarilie binde and cleaue together, and so likewise the blacke clay, from whence most naturally procéedeth your best lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, being mixt with white sand, doth also binde toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and stifle the séede, if it be not preuented by good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</p>
               <p>You shall therefore in the plowing and earring of these two soyles, obserue two especiall notes; the first, that by no meanes you plow it in the wet, that is, in any great glut of raine: for if you either lay it vp, or cast it downe, when it is more like morter then earth, if then any sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine, or faire weather, doe immediately follow vpon it, it will so drie and bake it, that if it be sowne, neither will the séede haue strength to sprout thorrow it, nor being in any of your other summer ardors, shall you by any meanes make your plough enter into it againe, when the season falleth for other plowing. The second, that you haue great care you lay your Land high and round, that the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
<pb facs="tcp:12353:44"/>
as it were standing vpright one by another, or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light and hollow, one vpon another, you may with more ease, at any time, enter in your plough, and turne your moulde which way you please, either in the heate of Sommer, or any other time of the yéere whatsoeuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the plough, which is most best and proper for these soyles, it would be the same in sise which is formerly directed for the red sand, onely the Irons must be altered, for the Coulter would be more long, sharpe, and bending, and the share so narrow, sharpe, and small as can conueniently be made, according as is formerly expressed, that not hauing power to take vp any broad furrow, the furrowes by reason of there slendernesse may lye many, and those many both hollow, light and at any time easily to be broken.</p>
               <p>As for the Teame which is best to worke in this soyle, they may be either Horses or Oxen, or Oxen and Horse mixt together, according to the Husbandmans abillitie, but if hée be a Lord of his owne pleasure and may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, and haue euery thing with is most apt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, then in these two soyles, I preferre the Teame of Horses single, rather then Oxen, especially in any winter or moist ardor, because they doe not tread and foyle the ground making it mirie and durtie as the Oxe doth, but going all in one furrow, doe kéepe the Land in his constant firmenesse.</p>
               <p>As touching the clotting, sleighting, wéeding, and dressing of these two soyles, they differ in nothing from the former mixt earths, but desire all one manner of dilligence: and thus much for these two soyles the blacke clay mixt with white sand, and the white clay with white red sand.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He reason why I haue thus at large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of euery seuerall soyle, both sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and compounded, is to show vnto the industrious Husbandman, the perfect and true reason of the generall alteration of our workes in Husbandry, through this our Realme of England: for if all our Land, as it is one kingdome, were likewise of one composition, mixture, and goodnesse, it were then excéeding preposterous to sée those diuersities, alterations, I, and euen contrary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of procéedings in Husbandry, which are daily and hourely vsed: but euery man in his owne worke knowes the alteration of clymates. Yet for so much as this labour of Husbandry, consisteth not for the most part in the knowing and vnderstanding breast, but in the rude, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ignorant Clowne, who onely knoweth how to doe his labour, but cannot giue a reason why he doth such labour, more then the instruction of his parents, or the custome of the Countrie, where it comes to passe (and I haue many times séene the same to mine admiration) that the skillfullest Clowne which is bred in the clay soyles, when hée hath béene brought to the sandy ground, hée could neither hould the plough, temper the plough, nor tell which way in good order to driue the Cattell, the heauinesse of the one labour being so contrary to the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the other, that not hauing a temperance, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in his hands, hée hath béene put euen vnto his wittes ends; therefore I thinke it conuenient, in this place, by a slight comparison of soyles together, to giue the simplest Husbandman such direct &amp; plaine rules that he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12353:45"/>
shall with out the study of his braines, attaine to absolute knowledge of euery seuerall mixture of earth: and albeit hée shall not be able distinctly to say at the first that it is compounded of such and such earths, yet hée shall be very able to deliuer the true reason and manner how such ground (of what nature soeuer) shall be Husbanded and titled.</p>
               <p>Therefore to begin the Husbandman, is to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that generally there are but two soyles for him to regard, for in them consisteth the whole Arte of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry: as namely, the open and loose earth, and the close and fast binding earth, and these two soyles being meare opposites and contraries, most necessarily require in the Husbandman a double vnderstanding, for there is no soyle, of what simplicitie or mixture soeuer it be, but it is either loose or fast.</p>
               <p>Now to giue you my meaning of these two words, <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>fast,</hi> it is, that euery soyle which vpon parching and dry weather, euen when the Sunne beames scorcheth, and as it were baketh the earth, if then the ground vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such excéeding drought doe moulder and fall to dust, so that whereas before when it did retaine moisture it was heauie, tough, and not to be seperated, now hauing lost that glewinesse it is light, loose, and euen with a mans foote to be spurnd to ashes, all such grounds are tearm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed loose and open grounds, because at no time they doe binde in or imprison the séede (the frost time onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is by accidence, and not from the nature of the foyle:) and all such grounds as in their moisture or after the fall of any sodaine raine are soft, plyable, light, and easie to be wrought, but after when they come to loose that moistnesse and that the powerfulnesse of the Sunne hath as it were drid vp their veynes, if then such earths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hard, firme, and not to be seperated, then are those soyles tearmed fast and binding soyles, for if there ardors be not taken in their due times, and their séede cast into them in perfect and due seasons, neither is it possible for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12353:45"/>
the Plowman to plow them, nor for the séede to sprout through, the earth being so fastned and as it were stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fixt together. Now sithence that all soyles are drawne into these two heads, fastnes, and loosenesse, and to them is annexed the diuersitie of all tillage, I will now show the simple Husbandman which earths be loose, and which fast, and how without curiositie to know and to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them.</p>
               <p>Breifely, all soyles that are simple and of themselues vncompounded, as namely, all claies, as blacke, white, gray, or blew, and all sands, as either red, white, or blacke, are open and loose soyles: the claies because the body and substance of them being held together by moistnes, that moisture being dryed vp, their strength and stifnesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth, and sands by reason of their naturall lighnesse, which wanting a more moist and fixt body to be ioyned with them doe loose all strength of binding or holding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Now all mixt or compound earths (except the compositions of one and the same kinds, as clay with clay, or sand with sand) are euer fast and binding earths: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt sand and clay, or clay &amp; grauell, is such an affinitie, that when they be mixt together the sand doth giue to the clay such hardnesse and drynesse, and the clay to the sand such moisture and coldnesse, that being fixt together they make one hard body, which through the warmth of the Sunne bindeth and cleaueth together. But if it be so that the ignorance of the Husbandman cannot either through the subtiltie of his eye sight, or the obseruations gathered from his experience, distinguish of these soyles, and the rather, sith many soyles are so indifferently mixt, and the colour so very perfect, that euen skill it selfe may be deceiued: as first to speake of what mixture some soyles consist, yet for as much as it is sufficient for the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to know which is loose and which is binding, hée shall onely when he is perplext with these differences, vse this experiment, hée shall take a good lumpe of that earth whose temperature hée would know, and working it with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12353:46"/>
water and his wet hands, like a péece of past, he shall then as it were make a cake thereof, and laying it before an hot fire, there let it lye, till all the moisture be dried &amp; backt out of it, then taking it into your hands and breaking it in péeces, if betwéene your fingers it moulder and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l into a small dust, then be assured it is a loose, simple, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compounded earth, but if it breake hard and firme, like a stone, and when you crumble it betwéene your fingers it be rough, gréetie, and shining, then be assured it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded fast-binding earth, and is compounded of clay and sand, and if in the baking it doe turne red or redish, it is compounded of a gray clay and red sand, but if it be browne or blewish, then it is a blacke clay &amp; white sand, but if when you breake it you finde therein many small pibles, then the mixture is clay and grauell. Now there be some mixt soyles, after they are thus bak't, although they be hard and binding, yet they will not be so excéeding hard and stone-like as other soyles will be, and that is where the mixture is vnequall, as where the clay is more then the sand, or the sand more then the clay.</p>
               <p>When you haue by this experiment found out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of your earth, and can tell whether it be simple or compounded, you shall then looke to the fruitfulnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which generally you shall thus distinguish. First, that clayes, simple and of themselues vncompounded, are of all the most fruitfull, of which, blacke is the best, that next to clayes, your mixt earths are most fertill, and the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the blacke clay and red sand, called a hasell earth, is the best, and that your sands are of all soyles most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, of which the red sand for profit hath euer the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence.</p>
               <p>Now for the generall tillage and vse of these grounds, you shall vnderstand that the simple and vncompounded grounds, being loose and open (if they lye frée from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of water) the Lands may be layd the flattest and greatest, the furrowes turned vp the largest and closest, and the plough and plough-Irons, most large and massie,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12353:46"/>
onely those for the sandy grounds must be more slender then those for the clayes and much more nimble, as hath, bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ne showed before. Now for the mixt earths, you shall lay your Lands high, round, and little, set your furrowes vpright, open, and so small as is possible, and make your plough and plow Irons most nimble and slender, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner before specified: and thus I conclude, that hée which knoweth the loose earth and the binding earth, can either helpe or abate the strength of the earth, as is néedfull, and knowes how to sorte his ploughes to each temper, knowes the ground and substance of all til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.</p>

                     <hi>The choise of seede Wheate.</hi>
                  </note> I will begin with Wheate, of which there are diuers kindes, as your whole straw Wheate, the great browne Pollard, the white Pollard, the Organe or red Wheate, the flaxen Wheate, and the chilter Wheate. Your whole straw Wheate, and browne Pollard, are knowne, the first, by his straw, which is full of pith, and hath in it no hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (whence it comes that Husbandmen estéeme it so much for their thacking, allowing it to be as good and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as réede:) the latter is knowne by his eare, which is great, white, and smooth, without anes or beard vpon it: in the hand they are both much like one to another, being of all Wheates the biggest, roundest and fullest: they be somewhat of a high colour, and haue vpon them a very thicke huske, which making the meale somewhat browne causeth the Baker not all together to estéeme them for his purest manchet, yet the yeeld of flower which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from them is as great and greater then any other Wheate whatsoeuer. These two sortes of Wheate are to be sowne vpon the fallow field, as crauing the greatest strength and fatnesse of ground, whence it comes that they are most commonly séene to grow vpon the richest and stiffest blacke clayes, being a graine of that strength that they will seldome or neuer mildew or turne blacke, as the other sortes of Wheate will doe, if the strength of the ground be not abated before they be throwne into the earth. Now for the choise of these two Wheates, if you be compelled to buy them in the market, you must regard that you buy that which is the cleanest and fairest, being vtterly without any wéedes, as darnell, cockell, tares or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12353:49"/>
any other foulnesse whatsoeuer: you shall looke that the Wheate, as neare as may be, hould all of one bignesse and all of one colour, for to beholde it contrary, that is to say, to see some great Cornes, some little, some high coloured, some pale, so that in their mixture they resemble change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able taffata, is an apparant signe that the Corne is not of one kinde but mixt or blended, as being partly whole-straw, partly Pollard, partly Organe, and partly Chelter. For the flaxen, it is naturally so white that it cannot be mixt but it may easily be discerned, and these mixt séedes are neuer good, either for the ground or the vse of man. Againe you shall carefully looke that neither this kinde of Wheate, nor any other that you buy for séede be blacke at the ends, for that is a signe that the graine comming from too rich a soyle was mildewed, and then it will neuer be fruitfull or proue good séede, as also you shall take care that it be not too white at the ends, showing the Corne to be as it were of two colours, for that is a signe that the Wheate was washt and dried againe, which vtterly confoundeth the strength of the Corne and takes from it all abilitie of bringing forth any great encrease. Now if it be so that you haue a crop of Wheate of your owne, so that you haue no néed of the market, you shall then picke out of your choisest sheafes, and vpon a cleane floare gently bat them with a slaile, and not thresh them cleane, for that Corne which is greatest, fullest, and ripest, will first flie out of the ears, and when you haue so batt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d a competent quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie you shall then winnow it and dresse it cleane, both by the helpe of a strong winde and open siues, and so make it fit for your séede.</p>
               <p>I haue séene some Husbands (and truely I haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted them both good and carefull) that haue before Wheate séede time both themselues, wiues, children, and seruants at times of best leasure, out of a great Wheate mow or bay, to gleane or pull out of the sheafes, eare by eare, the most principall eares, and knitting them vp in small bundells to bat them and make their séede thereof,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12353:49"/>
and questionlesse it is the best séede of all other: for you shall be sure that therein can be nothing but the cleanest and the best of the Corne, without any wéedes or foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which can hardly be when a man thresheth the whole sheate, and although some men may thinke that this labour is great and troblesome, especially such as sowe great quantities of Wheate, yet let them thus farre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage themselues, that if they doe the first yéere but gleane a bushell or two (which is nothing amongst a few persons) and sowe it vp on good Land, the encrease of it will the next yéere goe farre in the sowing the whole crop: for when I doe speake of this picking of Wheate, eare by eare, I doe not intend the picking of many quarters, but of so much as the increase thereof may amount to some quarter.</p>
               <p>Now there is also another regarde to be had (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailable as any of the former) in chusing of your séede Wheate, and that is to respect the soyle from whence you take your séede, and the soyle into which you put it, as thus.</p>
               <p>If the ground whereon you meane to sowe your Wheat be a rich, blacke, clay, stiffe and full of fertillitie, you shall then (as neare as you can) chuse your séede from the barrainest mixt earth you can finde (so the Wheate be whole-straw or Pollard) as from a clay and grauell, or a clay and white sand, that your séede comming from a much more barraine earth then that wherein you put it, the strength may be as it were redoubled, and the encrease consequently amount to a higher quantitie, as we finde it proueth in our daylie experience; but if these barraine soyles doe not afforde you séede to your contentment, it shall not then be amisse (you sowing your Wheate vpon fallow or tilth ground) if you take your séede Wheate either from an earth of like nature to your owne, or from any mixt earth, so that such séede come from the niams, that is, that it hath béene sowne after Pease, as being the third crop of the Land, and not from the fallow or tilth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:12353:50"/>
ground, for it is a maxiome amongst the best Husbands (though somewhat proposterous to common sence) bring to your rich ground séede from the barraine, and to the barraine séede from the rich, their reason (taken from their experience) being this, that the séede (as before I said) which prospereth vpon a leane ground being put into a rich, doth out of that superfluitie of warmth, strength and fatnesse, double his increase; and the séede which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the fat ground being put into the leane, hauing all the vigour, fulnesse and iuyce of fertilnes, doth not onely defend it selfe against the hungrinesse of the ground but brings forth increase contrary to expectation; whence procéedeth this generall custome of good Husbands in this Land, that those which dwell in the barraine woode Lands, heathes and high mountaine countries of this kingdome, euer (as néere as they can) séeke out their séede in the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full low vales, and very gardens of the earth, &amp; so likewise those in the vales take some helpes also from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</p>
               <p>Now for your other sortes of Wheate, that is to say, the white Pollard and the Organe, they are graines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so great, full, and large, as the whole straw, or browne Pollard, but small, bright, and very thinly huskt: your Organe is very red, your Pollard somewhat pale: these two sorts of Wheate are best to be sowne vpon the or fourth field, that is to say, after your Pease, for they can by no meanes endure an ouer rich ground, as being tender and apt to sprout with small moisture, but to mildew and choake with too much fatnesse, the soyles most apt for them are mixt earths, especially the blacke clay and red sand, or white clay and red sand, for as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other mixtures of grounds, they are for the most part so barraine, that they will but hardly bring forth Wheate vpon their fallow field, and then much worse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a fourth field. Now for any other particular choise of these two séedes, they are the same which I shewed in the whole straw, and great Pollard. As for the flaxen
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12353:50"/>
Wheate, and chilter Wheate, the first, is a very white Wheate both inward and outward, the other a pale red or déepe yellow: they are the least of all sorts of Wheate, yet of much more hardnes and toughnesse in sprouting, then either the Organe or white Pollard, and therefore desire somewhat a more richer soyle, and to that end they are for the most part sowne vpon fallow fields, in mixt earths, of what natures or barrainenesse soeuer, as is to be séene most generally ouer all the South parts of this Realme: and although vncompounded sands out of their owne natures, doe hardly bring forth any Wheate, yet vpon some of the best sands and vpon the flintie gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, I haue séene these two Wheates grow in good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, but being seldome it is not so much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected.</p>
               <p>After your Wheate you shall make choise of your Rie,<note place="margin">

                  </note> of which there is not diuers kindes although it carrie diuers complections, as some blackish, browne, great, full and long as that which for the most part growes vpon the red sand, or red clay, which is thrée parts red sand mixt with blacke clay, and is the best Rie: the other a pale gray Rie, short, small, and hungry, as that which growes vpon the white sand, or white clay and white sand, and is the worst Rie. Now you shall vnderstand that your sand grounds are your onely naturall grounds for Rie, as being indéede not principally apt for any other graine, therefore when you chuse your Rie for séede, you shall chuse that which is brownest, full, bould, and longest, you shall haue great care that it be frée from wéedes or filth, sith your sand grounds, out of their owne naturall heat, doth put forth such store of naughtie wéeds, that except a man be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily carefull, both in the choise and dressing of his Rie, he may easily be deceiued and poyson his ground with those wéedes, which with great difficultie are after rooted out againe.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12353:51"/>
you shall obserue that it be all of one Corne, and not ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that is, clay Barly, and sand Barly together, which you shall distinguish by these differences: the clay Barly is of a palish, white, yellow colour; smoth, full, large, and round, and the sand Barly is of a déepe yellow, browne at the neather end, long, slender, and as it were, withered, and in generall no sand Barly is principall good for séede: but if the Barly be somewhat of a high colour, and browne at the neather end, yet notwithstanding is very full, bould, and bigge, then it is a signe that such Barly comes not from the sand, but rather from an ouer fat soyle, sith the fatnesse of the earth doth euer alter the complection of the Barly; for the whiter Barly euer the leaner soyle, and better séede: you shall also obserue, that there be not in it any light Corne, which is a kinde of hungry graine without substance, which although it filleth the séeds-mans hand, yet it deceiueth the ground, and this light Corne will commonly be amongst the best Barly: for where the ground is so rich that it bringeth forth the Barly too rankely, there the Corne, wanting power to stand vpon roote, falleth to the ground, and so robde of kindly ripening, bringeth forth much light and insufficient graine. Next this, you shall take care that in your séede-Barly there be not any Oates, for although they be in this case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Husbandmen accounted the best of wéede, yet are they such a disgrace, that euery good Husband will most diligently eschew them, and for that cause onely will our most industrious Husbands bestow the tedious labour of gleaning their Barly, eare by eare, by which glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, in a yéere, or two, they will compasse their whole séede, which must infallibly be without either Oates or any wéede whatsoeuer: and although some grounds, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally your richest blacke clayes, will out of the abundance of their fruitfulnesse (as not induring to be Idle) bring forth naturally a certaine kinde of wilde Oates, which makes some ignorant Husbands lesse carefull of their séede, as supposing that those wilde ones are a poisoning
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12353:52"/>
to their graine, but they are infinetly deceiued: for such wilde Oates, wheresoeuer they be, doe shake and fall away long before the Barly be ready, so that the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman doth carry of them nothing into the Barne, but the straw onely. Next Oates, you must be carefull that there be in your Barly no other foule wéede: for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you sow, you must looke for the increase of the like nature, and therefore as before I said in the Wheate, so in the Barly, I would wish euery good Husband to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy some time in gleaning out of his Mow the principall eares of Barly, which being batted, drest, and sowne, by it selfe, albeit no great quantitie at the first, yet in time it may extend to make his whole séede perfect, and then hée shall finde his profit both in the market, where hée shall (for euery vse) sell with the déerest, and in his owne house where he shall finde his yeeld redoubled.</p>
               <p>Now for fitting of seuerall séedes to seuerall soyles, you shall obserue, that the best séede-Barly for your clay field, is ninam Barly, sowne vpon the clay field, that is to say, Barly which is sowne where Barly last grew, or a second crop of Barly: for the ground hauing his pride abated in the first croppe, the second, though it be nothing néere so much in quantitie, yet that Corne which it doth bring forth is most pure, most white, most full, and the best of all séedes whatsoeuer, and as in case of this soyle, so in all other like soyles which doe hould that strength or fruitfulnesse in them that they are either able of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or with some helpe of Manure in the latter end of the yéere, to bring forth two croppes of Barly, one after the other: but if either your soyle deny you this strength, or the distance of place bereane you of the commoditie thereof, then you shall vnderstand that Barly from a hasell ground is the best séede, for the clay ground, and Barly from the clay ground is the best séede, not onely for the hasell earth, but euen for all mixt earths whatsoeuer, and the Barly which procéedes from the mixt earths is the best séede for all simple and vncompounded sands or grauells,

as wée finde, both by their increasings and dayly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>

                  </note> Pease, or other Pulse, the scruple is nothing néere so great as of other séedes, because euery one that knowes any graine, can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them when hée sées them: besides they are of that massie waight, and so well able to indure the strength of the winde, that they are easie to be seuered from any wéede or filth whatsoeuer: it resteth therefore that I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue you instruction how to imploy them.</p>
               <p>You shall vnderstand therefore, that if your soyle be a stiffe, blacke, rich, clay, that then your best séede is cleane Beanes, or at the least thrée partes Beanes, and but one part Pease: if it be a gray, or white clay, then Beanes and Pease equally mixt together: if the best mixt earths, as a blacke clay and red sand, blacke clay and white sand, or white clay and red sand, then your séede must be cleane Pease onely: if it be white clay and white sand, blacke clay and blacke sand, then your séede must be Pease and Fitches mixt together: but if it be grauell or sand sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or grauell and sand compounded, then your séede must be either cleane Fitches, cleane Bucke, or cleane Tares, or else Fitches, Bucke and Tares mixt together.</p>

                     <hi>The choise of seede-Oates.</hi>
                  </note> You shall vnderstand that there be diuers kindes of them, as namely, the great long white Oate, the great long blacke Oate, the cut Oate, and the skegge: the two first of these are knowne by their greatnesse and colours, for they are long, full, bigge, and smooth, and are fittest to be sowne vpon the best of barraine grounds, for sith Oates are the worst of graine, I will giue them no other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie of place. The next of these, which is the cut Oate, it is of a pale yealow colour, short, smooth, and thicke, the increase of them is very great, and they are the fittest to be sowne vpon the worst of best grounds, for most commonly where you sée them, you shall also sée both good Wheate, good Barly, and good Beanes and Pease

also. Now for the skegge Oate, it is a little, small, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, leane Oate, with a beard at the small end like a wilde Oate, and is good for small vse more then Pullen onely: it is a séede méete for the barrainest and worst earth, as fit to grow but there where nothing of better profit will grow. And thus much for those séedes which are apt and in vse in our English soyles: wherein if any man imagine me guiltie of errour, in that I haue omitted particularly to speake of the séede of blend-Corne, or Masline, which is Wheate and Rye mixt together, I answere him, that sith I haue shewed him how to chuse both the best Wheate and the best Rye, it is an easie matter to mixe them according to his owne discretion.</p>

shale forth of the huske to the ground, to the great losse of the Husbandman. When hée hath prouided his shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, which he shall be carefull to haue very good, he shall then looke that neither out of their wantonnesse nor emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, they striue which shall goe fastest, or ridd most ground, for from thence procéedeth many errors in their worke, as namely, scattering, and leauing the Corne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut behind them, the cutting the heads of the Corne off so that they are not possible to be gathered, and many such like incommodities, but let them goe soberly and constantly, and sheare the Rye at least fourtéene inches aboue the ground.

Your Barly you shall not sheare, although it is a fashion in some Country, both because it is painefull and profitlesse, but you shall Mowe it close to the ground, and although in generall it be the custome of our kingdome, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your Barly is mowen and hath lyne a day or two in swathe, then with rackes to racke it together, and make it into great cockes, and so to leade it to the Barne, yet I am of this opinion that if your Barly be good and cleane without thistles or wéedes, that if then to euery sitheman, or Mower you alot two followers, that is to say, a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12353:54"/>
who with a little short rake and a small hooke shall gather the Corne together, and a binder, who shall make bands and binde vp the Barly in smale Sheafes, that questionlesse you shall finde much more profit thereby: and although some thinke the labour troublesome and great, yet for mine owne part, I haue séene very great croppes inned in this manner, and haue séene two women, that with great ease, haue followed and bound after a most principall Mower, which made me vnderstand that the toyle was not so great as mine imagination; and the profit ten-fold greater then the labour: but if your Corne be ill Husbanded, and full of thistles, wéedes, and all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then this practise is to be spared, and the loose cocking vp of your Corne is much better. Assoone as you haue cleansed any Land of Barly, you shall then immediatly cause one with a great long rake, of at least thirtie téeth, being in a sling bound bauticke-wise crosse his body, to draw it from one end of the Land to the other, all ouer the Land, that he may thereby gather vp all the loose Corne which is scattered, and carry it where your other Corne standeth, obseruing euer, as your cheifest rule, that by no meanes you neither leade Barly, nor any other graine whatsoeuer, when it is wet, no although it be but moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the dew onely: for the least dankishnesse, more then the sweate which it naturally taketh, will soone cause it to putrific.</p>

The time then fittest to cut your Oates is, assoone as they be somewhat more then halfe changed, but not altogether changed, that is, when they are more then two parts white, and yet the gréene not vtterly

If then it be cleane Beanes, or Beanes and Pease mixt, you shall mowe them, and being cleane Beanes rake them into heapes, and so make them vp into cockes, but if they be mixt you shall with hookes fould the Beanes into the Pease, and make little round reapes thereof, which after they haue béene turned and dryed, you may put twenty reapes together, and thereof make a cocke, and so lead them, and stacke them: but if they be cleane Pease, or Pease and Fitches, then you shall not mowe them, but with long hookes cut them from the ground, which is called Reaping, and so foulding them together into small reapes, as you did your Pease and Beanes, let them be turned and dryed, and so cocked, and carried either to the Barne, stacke, or houell.</p>
               <p>Now hauing thus brought in, and finished your Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest, you shall then immediately mowe vp the stubble, both of your Wheate, Rye, and Masline, and with all expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there-with thacke, and couer from Raine and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all such graine as for want of house-roome, you are compeld to lay abroad, either in stacke, or vpon houell: but if no such necessitie be, and that you haue not other more necessary imployment for your stubble, it shall be no part of ill Husbandry to let the stubble rot vpon the Land, which will be a reasonable Manuring or fatting of the earth.</p>

               <p>After Pease séede-time, you shall then thresh vp all that Barly which you meane to sell for séede, which euer is at the dearest reckoning of any graine whatsoeuer, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be principally good and cleane. After your séede-Barly is sould, you may then thresh vp all such Wheate, Rye, and Masline, as you intend to sell: for it euer giueth the greatest price from the latter end of May vntill the

In September you shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to sell your Malt, which being old and hauing lyne ripening the most part of the yéere, must now at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the yéere, when all old store is spent, and the new cannot be come to any perfection, be most deare, and of the greatest estimation: and thus being a man of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the world, and able to put euery thing to the best vse, you may by these vsuall obseruations, and the helpe of a better iudgement, imploy the fruits of your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to the best profit, and sell euery thing at the highest price, except you take vpon you to giue day and sell vpon trust, which if you doe, you may then sell at what vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seionable reckoning you will, which because such vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall exactions neither agrée with charitie, nor humanitie, I will forbeare to giue rules for the same, and referre euery man that is desirous of such knowledge, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the world, wherein he shall finde presidents inough for such euill customes.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough many authors which I haue read, both in Italian, French, and Dutch, doe make a diuersitie and distinguishment of Orchardes, as namely, one for profit, which they fashion rudely and without forme, the other for delight, which they make comely, decent, and with all good proportion, deuiding the quarters into squares, making the alleyes of a constant breadth, and planting the fruit-trées in arteficiall rowes: yet for as much as the comelinesse and well contriuing of the ground, doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abate, but rather increase the commoditie, I will therefore ioyne them both together, and make them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but one Orchard. Now for the scyte and placing of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12353:57"/>
this Orchard, I haue in the modell of my Country house, or Husbandmans Farme, shewed you where if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it should stand, and both what Sunne &amp; ayre it should lye open vpon: but if the scyte or ground-plot of your house will not giue you leaue to place your Orchard according to your wish, you shall then be content to make a vertue of necessitie, and plant it in such a place as is most conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and nearest alyed to that forme before prescribed.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Now when you haue found out a perfect ground pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> shall then cast it into a great large square, which you shall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12353:57"/>
fence in either with a stone or bricke wall, high, strong pale, or great ditch with a quicke-set hedge, but the wall is best and most durable, and that wall would haue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inside within twelue or fourtéene foote on of another, Iames or outshoots of stone or bricke, betweene which you may plant and plash those fruit-trées which are of greatest tendernesse, the South and West Sunne hauing power to shine vpon them.</p>
               <p>When you haue thus fenc'st in this great square, you shall then cast foure large alleyes, at least fourtéene foote broad, from the wall round about, and so likewise two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alleyes of like breadth, directly crosse ouerthwart the ground-plot, which will deuide the great square into foure lesser squares, according to the figure before set downe.</p>
               <p>The figure 1. sheweth the alleyes which both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe about, and also crosse ouer the ground-plot, and the figure 2. sheweth the foure quarters where the fruit-trées are to be planted.</p>
               <p>Now if either the true nature and largnesse of the ground be sufficient, or your owne abilitie of pursse so great that you may compasse your desires in these earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasures, it shall not be amisse, but a matter of great state, to make your ground-plot full as bigge againe, that is to say, to containe eight large quarters, the first foure being made of an euen leuell, the other foure being raysed at least eight foote higher then the first, with conuenient stayres of state for ascending to the same, to be likewise vpon another euen leuell of like forme, and if in the center of the alleyes, being the mid-point betwéene the squares, might be placed any quaint fountaines or any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique standard, the platforme would be more excellent and if vpon the ascent from one leuell to another there might be built some curious and arteficiall banquetting house, it would giue luster to the Orchard.</p>
               <p>Now for the planting and furnishing of these quarters: you shall vnderstand that if your Orchard containe but foure quarters, then the first shalbe planted with Apple-trées,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12353:58"/>
of all sorts, the second with Peares and Wardens of all sorts, the third with Quinces &amp; Chesnutes, the fourth with Medlars &amp; seruices. Against the North side of your Orchard wall against which the South sunne reflects, you shall plant the Abricot, Uerdochio, Peach, and Damaske-plumbe: against the East side of the wall, the whit Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kadine Grape, the Pescod-plumbe, and the Emperiall-plumbe: against the West side the grafted Cherries, and the Oliue-trée: and against the South side the Almond, &amp; Figge trée. Round about the skirts of euery other outward or inward alley, you shall plant, the Wheate-plumbe, both yealow &amp; redde, the Rye-plumbe, the Damson, the Horse-clog, Bulleys of all kindes, ordinary french Cherryes, Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts, and Nuts of all sorts, together with the Prune-plumbe, and other such like stone fruits. But if your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard be of state and prospect, so that it containe eight quarters or more (according to the limitation of the earth) then you shall in euery seuerall quarter plant a seuerall fruit, as Apple-trées in one quarter, Peares in another, Quinces in another, Wardens in another, and so forth of the rest. Also you shall obserue in planting your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Peares, and Plumbes, that you plant your summer or early fruit by themselues, and the Winter or long last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit by themselues. Of Apples, your Ienitings, Wibourns, Pomederoy, and Quéene-Apples are reckoned the best earely fruits, although their be diuers others, and the Pippin, Peare-maine, Apple-Iohn, and Russetting, your best Winter and long lasting fruit, though there be a world of other: for the tastes of Apples are infinite, according to there composition and mixture in grafting. Of Peares your golden Peare, your Katherine-Peare, your Lording, and such like, are the first, and your stone-Peare, Warden-Peare, and choake-Peare, those which indure longest. And of Plumbes the rye-plumbe is first, your Wheate-plumbe next, and all the other sorts of plumbes ripen all most together in one season, if they haue equall warmth, and be all of like comfortable standing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:12353:58"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the orderly placing of your trées, you shall vnderstand that your Plumbe-trées (which are as it were a fence or guard about your great quarters) would be placed in rowes one by one, aboue fiue foote distance one from another, round about each skirt of euery alley: your Apple-trées &amp; other greater fruit which are to be planted in the quarters, would be placed in such arteficiall rowes that which way soeuer a man shall east his eyes yet hée shall sée the trées euery way stand in rowes, making squares, alleyes, and deuisions, according to a mans ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12353:59"/>
according to the figure before, which I would haue you suppose to be one quarter in an Orchard, and by it you may easily compound the rest: wherein you shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that the lesser prickes doe figure your Plumbe-trées, &amp; the greater prickes your Apple-trées, and such other large fruit.</p>
               <p>Now you shall vnderstand that euery one of these great trées which furnish the maine quarter, shall stand in a direct line, iust twelue foote one from another, which is a space altogether sufficient inough for there spreading, without waterdropping or annoying one another; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided that the Fruiterer, according to his duty, be carefull to preserue the trées vpright and to vnderprope them when by the violence of the winde they shall swarue any way. Upon the ascent or rising from one leuell to another, you may plant the Barberry-trées, Feberries, and Raspber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of all sorts, which being spreading, thorny and sharpe, trées, take great delight to grow thicke and close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by which meanes often times they make a kinde of wall, hedge, or fencing, where they stand.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus shewed you the ground-plot aud propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Orchard, with the seuerall deuisions, ascents, and squares, that should be contained therein, and the fruits which are to furnish euery such square and deuision, and their orderly placing, it now rests that you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that this Orchard-plot, so neare as you can bring it to passe, doe stand most open and plaine, vpon the South and West sunne, and most defended from the East and North windes and bitternesse, which being obserued your plot is then perfect and absolute.</p>
               <p>Now forasmuch as where nature, fruitfulnesse, and situation doe take from a man more then the halfe part of his industrie, and by a direct and easie way doth lead him to that perfection which others cannot attaine to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infinit labour and trauell: and whereas it is nothing so commendable to maintaine beautie, as to make defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie beautifull, I will speake something of the framing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12353:59"/>
of Orchard-plots there where both nature, the situation, and barrainnesse, doe vtterly deny the enioying of any such commoditie, as where the ground is vneuen, stome, sandy, or in his lownesse subiect to the ouerflow of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, all being apparant enemies to these places of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and delight. First, for the vneuennesse of the ground, if that be his vttermost imperfection, you shall first not onely take a note with your eye, but also place a marke vpon the best ascent of the ground to which the leuell is fittest to be drawne, and then plowing the ground all ouer with a great common plough, by casting the furrowes downward, séeke to fill in and couer the lesser hollownesses of the ground, that their may not any thing appeare but the maine great hollowes, which with other earth which is frée from stones, grauell, or such like euils, you shall fill vp and make leuell with that part where your marke standeth, and being so leuelled, forthwith draw the plot of your Orchard: but if the ground be not onely vneuen but also barraine, you shall then to euery loade of earth you carry to the leuelling adde a loade of Manure, either Oxe Manure, or Horse Manure, the rubbish of houses, or the clensings of olde ditches, or standing pooles, and the earth will soone become fertill and perfect; but if the ground be stonie, that is, full of great stones, as it is in D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rbishire about the Peake or East Mores, for small pib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or small lime-stones are not very much hurtfull, then you shall cause such stones to be digd vp, and fill vp the places where they lay either with marle, or other rich earth, which after it hath béene setled for a yéere or two you shall then plough, and leuell it, and so frame forth the plot of your Orchard. If the ground be onely a barraine sand, so that it wanteth strength either to maintaine or bring forth, you shall then first digge that earth into great trenches, at least foure foote déepe, and filling them vp with Oxe Manure, mixe it with the sand that it may change some part of the colour thereof and then leuelling it fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out your Orchard. But lastly, and which is of all situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12353:60"/>
the worst, if you haue no ground to plant your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard vpon, but such as either through the neighbourhood of riuers, descent of Mountaines, or the earths owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall quallitie in casting and vomiting out water and moysture, is subiect to some small ouerflowes of water, by which you cannot attaine to the pleasure you séeke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause fruit-trées can neuer indure the corruption of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, you shall then in the dryest season of the yéere, after you haue marked out that square or quantitie of ground which you intend for your Orchard, you shall then cast therein sundry ditches, at least sixtéene foote broad, and nine foote déepe, and not aboue twelue foote betwixt ditch and ditch, vpon which reserued earth casting the earth that you digged vp, you shall raise the banckes at least seauen foote high of firme earth, and kéepe in the top the full breadth of twelue foote, with in a foote or little more: and in the casting vp of these bankes you shall cause the earth to be beaten with maules and broad béetels that it may lye firme, fast, and leuell, and after these bankes haue rested a yéere or more, and are sufficiently setled, you may then at the neather end of the banke, neare to the verge of the water plant store of Osyers, which will be a good defence to the banke, and vpon the top and highest part of the banke you shall plant your Orchard and fruit-trées, so that when any inundation of water shall happen, the ditches shalbe able inough to receiue it; or else making a passage from your Orchard into some other sewer, the water excéeding his limits may haue a frée current or passage: besides these ditches being neatly kept, and comforted with fresh water, may make both pleasant and commodious fish-ponds. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so you must be carefull in casting these bankes that you doe not place them in such sort that when you are vpon one you cannot come to the other, but rather like a maze, so that you may at pleasure passe from the one to the other round about the ground, making of diuers bankes to the eye but one banke in substance, and of diuers ponds in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but one in true iudgement. And thus much for the plot or situation of an Orchard.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough great persons, out of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and abilitie, doe buy their fruit trées ready grafted, and so in a moment may plant an Orchard of the greatest quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet sith the Husbandman must raise euery thing from his owne indeauours, and that I onely write for his profit, I therefore hould it most conuenient to beginne with the nursery or store-house of fruits, from whence the Orchard receiueth his beauty and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iches.</p>
               <p>This Nursery must be a péece of principall ground, either through Art or Nature, strongly fenced, warme, and full of good shelter: for in it is onely the first infancy and tendernesse of fruit-trées, because there they are first kernells, or stones, after sprigs, and lastly trées.</p>
               <p>Now for the manner of chusing, sowing, and planting them in this nursery, I differ some thing from the french practise, who would chuse the kernells from the cider presse, sow them in large bedds of earth, and within a yeere after replant them in a wilde Orchard: now for mine owne part, though this course be not much faulty yet I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse this kinde of practise, first: to chuse your kernells either of Apples, Peares, or Wardens, from the best and most principallest fruit you can tasté, for although the kernell doe bring forth no other trée but the plaine stocke vpon which the fruit was grafted, as thus, if the graft were put into a Crab-stocke the kernell brings forth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Crab-trée, yet when you taste a perfect and delicate Apple, be assured both the stocke and graft were of the best choise, and so such kernells of best reckoning. When you haue then a competent quantitie of such kernells, you
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12353:61"/>
shall take certaine large pots, in the fashion of milke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boules, all full of hoales in the bottome, through which the raine and superfluous moysture may auoyde, and either in the Months of March or Nouember (for those are the best seasons) fill the pots three parts full of the finest, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and richest mould you can get, then lay your kernells vpon the earth, about foure fingars one from another, so many as the vessell can conueniently containe, and then with a siue sift vpon them other fine moulds almost three fingars thicke, and so let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if any man desire to know my reason why I rather desire to set my kernells rather in vessells then in beds of earth, my answere is, that I haue often found it in mine experience, that the kernell of Apples, Peares, Quinces, and such like, are such a tender and dainty séede that it is great odo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Now for the stones of Plumbes, &amp; other stone fruit, you shall vnderstand that they be of two kindes, one simple and of themselues, as the Rye-plumbe, Wheate-plumbe, Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Prune-plumbe, Horse-clogge, Cherry, and such like, so that from the kernells of them issueth trées of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and goodnesse: the other compounded or grafted plumbes, as the Abricot, Pescod, Peach, Damaske, Uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochyo, Emperiall, and such like, from whose kernells issueth no other trées but such as the stockes were vpon which they were grafted.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S you are to furnish your nursery with all sorts of kernells and stones, for the brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of stockes where on to graft the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest fruits you can compasse, so shall you also plant therein the cyons and branches of the best fruit trées: which cyons and branches doe bring forth the same fruit which the trées doe from whence they are taken, and by that meanes your nursery shall euer afford you perfect trées, wherewith either to furnish your owne grounds, or to pleasure your neighbours. And herein by the way you shall vnderstand that some trées are more fit to be set then to be sowne, as namely, the Seruice-trée, the Medler, the Filbert and such like. Now for the Seruice-trée, hée is not at all to be grafted, but set in this wise: take of the bastard cyons such as be somewhat bigger then a mans thumbe, and cutting away the branches thereof, set it in a fine loose mould, at least a foote déepe, and it will prosper exceedingly, yet the true nature of this trée is not to be remoued, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is conuenient that it be planted where it should euer continue: in like manner to the Seruice-tree, so you shall plant the bastard cyons of the Meblar-trée either in March or October, and at the waine of the moone.</p>
               <p>Now for the Filbert, or large Hassell-nut, you shall take the smallest cyons or wands, such as are not aboue two yéeres groath, being full of short heauie twigges, and grow from the roote of the maine trée, and set them in a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12353:62"/>
loose mould, a foote déepe, without pruning or cutting away any of the branches, and they will prosper to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Now for all sorts of Plumbe-trées, Apple-trées or other fruit-trées which are not grafted, if you take the young cyons which grow from the rootes cleane from the rootes, and plant them either in the spring, or fall, in a fresh and fine mould, they will not onely prosper, but bring forth fruit of like nature and qualitie to the trees from whence they were taken.</p>
               <p>Now for your grafted fruit, as namely, Apples, Plumbes, Cherryes, Mulberries, Quinces, and such like, the cyons also and branches of them also will take roote and bring forth fruit of the same kinde that the trées did from whence they were taken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> but those cyons or branches must euer be chosen from the vpper parts of the trées, betwixt the feast of all-Saints and Christmas, they must be bigger then a mans finger, smooth, straight, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out twigges: you shall with a sharpe chissell cut them from the body or armes of the trée with such care, that by no meanes you raise vp the barke, and then with a little yealow waxe couer the place from whence you cut the cyon: then hauing digged and dunged the earth well where you intend to plant them, and made the mould easie, you shall with an Iron, as bigge as your plant, make a hoale a foote déepe or better, and then put in your cyon and with it a few Oates, long stéept in water, and so fixe it firme in the mould, and if after it beginneth to put forth you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any young cyons to put forth from the root thereof, you shall immediatly cut them off, &amp; either cast them away or plant them in other places, for to suffer them to grow may bréede much hurt to the young trées. Now where as these cyons thus planted are for the most part small and weake, so that the smallest breath of winde doth shake and hurt their rootes, it shalbe good to pricke strong stakes by them, to which, fastning the young plant with a soft hay rope it may the better be defended from stormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:12353:63"/>Next to these fruit-trées, you shall vnderstand that your bush-trées, as Barberryes, Gooseberryes, or Feber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, Raspberryes, and such like, will also grow vpon cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without rootes, being cut from their maine rootes in Nouember, &amp; so planted in a new fresh mould. And here by the way I am to giue you this note or caueat, that if at any time you finde any of these cyons which you haue planted not to grow and flourish according to your desire, but that you finde a certaine mislike or consumption in the plant, you shall then immediatly with a sharpe knife cut the plant off slope-wise vpward, about three fingars from the ground, and so let it rest till the next spring, at which time you shall beholde new cyons issue from the roote, which will be without sicknesse or imperfection; and from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this experiment I imagine the gardners of antient time found out the meanes to get young cyons from olde Mulberry-trées, which they doe in this manner: first, you must take some of the greatest armes of the Mulberry-trée about the midst of Nouember, and with a sharpe sawe to sawe them into bigge truncheons, about fiuetéene inches long, and then digging a trench in principall good earth, of such depth that you may couer the truncheons, being set vp on end, with Manure and fine mould, each truncheon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a foote one from another, and couerd more then foure fingars aboue the wood, not fayling to water them when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer néede shall require, and to preserue them from wéeds and filthinesse, within lesse then a yéeres space you shall behold those truncheons to put forth young cyons, which as soone as they come to any groath and be twigged, then you may cut them from the stockes, and transplant them where you please, onely the truncheons you shall suffer to remaine still, and cherish them with fresh dunge, and they will put forth many moe cyons, both to furnish your selfe and your friends.

So for Peares, you shall graft them vpon Peare stockes, Quinces vpon Quinces or Crab-trées, and not according to the opinion of the french<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, vpon white thorne or willow, the Medlar vpon the Seruice-trée, and the Seruice vpon the Medlar, also Cherryes vpon Cherryes, &amp; Plumbes vpon Plumbes, as the greater Abricots vpon the lesser Abricots, the Peach, the Figge, or the Danison-trée, and to speake generally without wasting more paper, or making a long circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to slender purpose, the Damson-trée is the onely principall best stocke whereupon to graft any kinde of Plumbe or stone fruit whatsoeuer.</p>

Now you shall euer, as néere as you can, chuse your grafts from a young trée, and not from an olde, and from the tops of the principall branches, and not from the midst of the trée, or any other superfluous arme or cyon; now if after you haue got your grafts you haue many dayes Iourneys to carry them, you shall fould them in a few fresh mouldes, and binde them about with hay, and hay ropes, and so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them all day, and in the night bury them all ouer in the ground and they will containe their goodnesse for a long season.</p>

vpon the head of the stocke, and that the out side of the graft doe agrée directly with the out side of the stocke, ioyning barke vnto barke, and sappe vnto sappe, so euen, so smooth, and so close, that no ioyners worke may be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ioyne more arteficially: which done, vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the stocke, in the other cleft, you shall place your other graft, with full as much care, diligence, and euery other obseruation: when both your grafts are thus orderly and arteficially placed, you shall then by setting the haft of your chissell against the stocke, with all lenitie and gentlenesse, draw forth your wedge, in such sort that you doe not displace or alter your grafts, and when your wedge is forth you shall then looke vpon your grafts, and if you perceiue that the stocke doe pinch or squize them, which you may discerne both by the straitnesse and bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the outmost barke, you shall then make a little wedge of some gréene sappy woode, and driuing it into the cleft, ease your grafts, cutting that wedge close to the stocke. When you haue thus made both your grafts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, you shall then take the barke of either Apple-trée, Crab-trée or Willow-trée, and with that barke couer the head of the stocke so close that no wet or other annoyance may get betwixt it and the stocke, then you shall take a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient quantitie of clay, which indéede would be of a bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mingled earth, and tempering it well, either with mosse or hay, lay it vpon the barke, and daube all the head of the stocke, euen as low as the bottome of the grafts, more then an inch shicke, so firme, close, and smooth as may be, which done, couer all that clay ouer with soft mosse, and that mosse with some ragges of wollen cloath, which being gently bound about with the inward barkes of Willow, or Osyar, let the graft rest to the pleasure of the highest: and this is called grafting in the cleft.</p>

cut them so thinne as the grafts of Apples, Quinces, or Medlars, because they haue a much larger and rounder pith, which by no meanes must be toucht but fortefied and preserued, onely to the neather end you may cut them as thinne as is possible, the pith onely preserued.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you shall into your greatest stockes put your greatest grafts, and into your least, the least, that there may be an equall strength and conformitie in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if at any time you be inforced to graft vpon an olde trée, that is great and large, then you shall not graft into the body of that trée, because it is impossible to kéepe it from putrifaction and rotting before the grafts can couer the head, but you shall chuse out some of the principall armes or branches, which are much more slender, and graft them, as is before shewed, omitting not dayly to cut away all cyons, armes, branches, or superfluous sprigs which shall grow vnder those branches which you haue newly grafted: but if there be no branch, small or tender inough to graft in, then you shall cut away all the maine branches from the stocke, and couering the head with clay and mosse, let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fourthly, if when you either sawe off the top of your stocke, or else cleaue the head, you either raise vp the barke or cleaue the stocke too déepe, you shall then sawe the stocke againe, with a little more carefulnesse, so much lower as your first errour had committed a fault.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, you shall from time to time looke to the binding of the heads of your stockes, in so much that if either the clay doe shrinke away or the other couerings doe losen, by which defects ayre, or wet, may get into the incission, you shall presently with all spéede amend and repaire it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if you graft in any open place where cattell doe graze, you shall not then forget as soone as you haue finisht your worke to bush or hedge in your graft, that it may be defended from any such negligent annoyance. And thus

And herein you shall vnderstand, that as the best times for grafting are euery month (except October and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember) and at the change of the moone, so the best times for replanting, are Nouember and March onely, vnlesse the ground be cold and moist and then Ianuary, or Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary must be the soonest all wayes, excepted that you doe not replant in the time of frost, for that is most vnhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>

               <p>Now, although I haue vnder the title and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12353:70"/>
of replanting one trée giuen you a generall instruction for the replanting of all trées whatsoeuer, yet, for as much as some are not of that strength and hardnesse to indure so much as some others will, therefore you shal take these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations by the way, to fortefie your knowledge with.</p>
               <p>First, you shall vnderstand that all your dainty and tender grafted Plumbes, and fruits, as Abricots, Peaches, Damaske-Plumbes, Uerdochyos, Pescods, Emperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, and diuers such like, together with Orrenges, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, Almonds, Oliues, and others, which indéede are not familiar with our soytes, as being nearer neighbours to the sunne, doe delight in a warme, fat, earth, being somewhat sandy, or such a clay whose coldnesse by Manure is corrected, and therefore here with vs in the replan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them you cannot bestow too much cost vpon the mould: as for the Damson, and all our naturall english Plumbes, they loue a fat, cold, earth, so that in the replan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them if you shall lay too much dunge vnto their roote, you shall through the aboundant heate, doe great hurt vnto the trée. The cherry delighteth in any clay, so that vpon such soyle you may vse lesse Manure, but vpon the contrary you cannot lay too much. The Medlar estéemeth all earths alike, and therefore whether it be Manured or no it skilles not, sunne and shadow, wet and drinesse, being all of one force or efficacy. The Peare and Apple-trée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in a strong mixt soyle, and therfore indureth Manure kindly, so doth also the Quince and Warden: lastly the Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, the Hasell, and the Chesnut, loue cold, leane, moist, and sandy earths, in so much that there is no greater enimy vnto them then a rich soyle: so that in replanting of them you must euer séeke rather to correct then increase fertility.</p>
               <p>You shall also vnderstand that all such fruit-trées as you doe plant against the walles of your Orchard (of which I haue spoken already &amp; deciphered out their places) you shall not suffer to grow as of themselues, round, and from the wall, but at the times of pruning and dressing of them (which is euer at the beginning of the spring and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

               <p>

If the season doe grow dry, you may vse to water them, but not in such sort as you water other plants, which is to sprinckle water round about the earth of the rootes, but you shall with a round Iron made for the purpose somewhat bigger then a mans fingar, make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine holes into the earth, close vpon the roote of the Uine, and powre therein either water, the dregges of strong-Ale, or the lées of Wine, or if you will you may mixe with the lées of Wine either Goats-milke, or Cowes-milke, and power it into the holes and it will nourish the Uine excéedingly, and not the Uine onely, but all sorts of dainty grafted Plumbes, especially Peaches.</p>

                  </note> you shall vnderstand that it is euer to be done after the fall of the leafe, when the sappe is desended downeward: for if you shall proyne, or cut him, either in the spring, or when the sappe is aloft, it will bléede so excéedingly, that with great difficulty you shall saue the body of the trée from dying: and in proy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Uine you shall obserue two things, the first, that you cut away all superfluous cyons and branches, both aboue and below, which either grow disorderly aboue, or fruitlessely below, and in cutting them you shall obserue, neither to cut the olde woode with the young cyon, nor to leaue aboue one head or leader vpon one branch: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you shall in proyning, plash and spread the UINE

thinnely against the wall, giuing euery seuerall branch and cyon his place, and passage, and not suffer it to grow loosely, rudely, or like a wilde thorne, out of all decency and proportion: for you must vnderstand that your Grapes doe grow euer vpon the youngest cyons, and if of them you shall preserue too many, questionlesse for want of nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they will lose their vertue, and you your profit. Now if your Uine be a very old Uine, and that his fruit doth decay, either in quantitie or proportion; if then you finde he haue any young cyons which spring from his roote, then when you proyne him you shall cut away all the olde stocke, within lesse then an handfull of the young cyons, and make them the leaders, who will prosper and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in perfection a long time after, especially if you trimme the rootes with fresh earth, and fresh dunge. Againe, if you be carefull to looke vnto your Uine, you shall perceiue close by euery bunch or grapes certaine small thridde-like cyons, which resemble twound wyars, curling and turning in many rings, these also take from the grapes very much nutriment, so that it shall be a labour very well imployd to cut them away as you perceiue them.</p>

Lastly, you may if you please graft one Uine vpon another, as the swéet vpon the sower, as the Muskadine grape, or gréeke, vpon the Rochell or Burdeaux, the Spanish, or Iland grape, on the Gascoyne, and the Orleance vpon any at all: and these compositions are the best, and bring forth both the greatest and pleasan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test grapes: therefore whensoeuer you will graft one grape vpon another, you shall doe it in the beginning of Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, in this sort: first, after you haue chosen and trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med your grafts, which in all sorts must be like the grafts of other fruits, then with a sharpe knife, you shall cleaue the head of the Uine, as you doe other stockes and then put in your graft, or cyon, being made as thinne as may be and sée that the barkes and sappes ioyne euen and close together, then clay it, mosse it, and couer it, as hath béene before declared.</p>

In this sort hauing preserued your Cherries from destruction, you shall then know there ripenesse by their colours, for euer those which are most red, are most ripe, and when you sée any that are ripe, you shall take a light ladder, made either of fyrre or sallow, and setting it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully against the branches, so as you neither bruise them nor the fruit, you shall gather those you finde ripe, not taking the fruit from the stalke, but nipping the stalke and fruit both together from the trée: also you shall be carefull in gathering to handle or touch the Cherry so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as may be, but the stalke onely, especially if your hands be hot, or sweaty, for that will change the colour of your Cherries, and make them looke blacke: if there be any ripe Cherries which hang out of the reach of your hands, then you shall haue a fine small gathering hooke of woode, whose bout shall be made round, and smooth, for nipping the barke of the branches, and with it you shall gently pull vnto you those branches you cannot reach: you shall also haue a little round basket of almost a foote déepe, made with a siue bottome, hauing a handle thwarte the toppe, to which a small hooke being fastned, you shall with that hooke hang the basket by you on some conuenient cyon, and as you gather the Cherries, gently lay them downe into the same, and when you haue filled your basket you shall descend and empty it into larger great baskets made of the same fashion, with siue bottomes, and hauing vnderneath two broad lathes or splinters, at least thrée fingers broad a péece, within foure inches one of the other, and going both one way crosse ouerthwart the basket, that if either man or woman shall carry them vpon their heads, which is the best manner of cariage, then the sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may defend the bottome of the basket from the head of the party, and kéepe the Cherries from hurt or bruising, and if you haue occasion to carry your Cherries farre, and that the quantitie grow beyond the support of a man, then you shall packe them in hampers or panniers made with

You shall by no meanes suffer your Cherries to lye in any great or thicke heapes one vpon another, but vntill you sell them, or vse them, lay them as thinne as may be, because they are apt of themselues to sweat and catch heate, and that heate doth soone depriue them of the glory of their colour.

                  </note> it is in the same manner as you did gather your Cherries, both with such a like ladder, such a like hooke, and such like vessels, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some more speciall obseruations are to be obserued in gathering your dainty grafted Plumbes, then of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which are of a more hard and induring nature. You shall know then that for gathering of Abricots, Peaches, Date-Plumbes, and such like grafted Plumbes, you shall duely consider when they are perfectly ripe, which you shall not iudge by their dropping from the trée, which is a signe of ouer-much ripnesse, tending to rottennesse, but by the true mixture of their colour, and perfect change from their first complexion: for when you shall perceiue that there is no gréenenesse nor hardnesse in their out-sides, no, not so much as at the setting on of the stalke, you may then iudge that they are ready to be gathered, and for a perfecter try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thereof you may if you please, take one which you thinke ripest from the trée, and opening it if you sée the stone comes cleane and dry away and not any of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the fruit cleauing vnto it, then you may assure your selfe that the fruit is ready to be gathered, which you shall with great deligence and care gather, not by any meanes laying one Plumbe vpon another, but each seuerally by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, for these dainty Plumbes are naturally so tender that the least touch, though of themselues, doth bruise them,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12353:78"/>
and occasion rottennesse. Now when you haue gathered them, if either you haue desire to send them any iourney, as in gratulation to your friends, or for other priuate commoditie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> you shall take some close, smooth, boxe, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the store of fruit you are to send, and first line it within all ouer with white paper, then lay your Plumbes one by one all ouer the bottome of the boxe, then couering them all ouer with white paper, lay as many moe vpon the toppe of them, and couer them likewise with paper, as before, and so lay row vpon row with papers betwéene them, vntill the boxe be sufficiently filled, and then closing it vp sende it whether you please, and they will take the least hurt, whereas if you should line the boxe either with hay or straw, the very skinnes are so tender that the straw would print into them and bruise them excéedingly, and to lay any other soft thing about them, as either wooll or bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bast, is excéeding euill, because it heateth the Plumbes, and maketh them sweat, through which they both loose their colour and rot spéedily.<note place="margin">

                  </note> As touching the gathering of Plumbes when they are hard, and to ripen them afterward by laying them vpon nettles, to which consenteth the most of our London-Fruiterrers, I am vtterly against the opinion, because I both know Nature to be the perfectest worke-Mistris, and where she is abridged of her power there euer to follow disorders and imperfections, as also that when such things are done, as it were through an ouer-hasty constraint, there cannot procéede any thing but abortiuenesse, and a distastfull rellish: from whence I thinke it comes to passe that in London a man shall very seldome tast a delicate or well rellisht Plumbe, vnlesse it be from such as hauing fruit of their owne, make no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie thereof more then their owne pleasures:<note place="margin">

                  </note> yet thus much I would perswade euery one, that if they haue moe Plumbes ripe at once then they can vse, or spend, that then after they are gathered, to spread them thinnely vpon Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles or Uine-trée leaues, and it will preserue them sound and well coloured a long time together, but if your store be

so superabundant that in no reasonable time you can spend them, then what you doe not preserue, or make Godiniake, or Maruulade of, the rest you shall take and sprinkling them ouer with swéet-worte, or growt, and then laying them one by one (yet so as they may not touch one another) vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hurdles or fleakes made of wands, or twigges, and put them into an Ouen after bread or Pyes haue béene taine thereout, and so leasurely dry them, and they will not onely last, but tast pleasantly all the yéere after: and in this sort you may vse all kindes of Plumbes, or Peares, whatsoeuer. Now for the gathering of the other ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sorts of vngrafted Plumbes, which haue both much stronger rindes, and are lesse subiect to rotting, you shall gather them, carry, or transport them, in the same manner that you did your Cherries, onely in these, as in all other sorts of fruit whatsoeuer, you shall not omit neuer to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or pull them from the trée, till the dewe be dryed cleane both from the grasse and from the trées, and that the day be dry, faire, and full of sunne-shine: for the least wet or moisture doth canker and rot the fruit.</p>

If because you are vnexperienced or vnacquainted with the fruit you doe not know the due time of his ripening, you shall obserue the colour of the Peare, and if you sée it doe alter, either in part, or in all, you shall be assured the fruit is neare ripening, for Peares doe neuer change their colours, but when they doe desire to be taken from the trée: and of all fruit the Peare may be gathered the hardest,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12353:79"/>
because both his owne naturall heate and peculiar quallitie will ripen him best with lying: yet to be more strongly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefied in the knowledge of the ripenesse of your fruit, and because it is better to get a day too late, then an hower too earely, you shall before you gather your Peares, whether they be Summer fruit or Winter fruit, or whether you meane to spend them soone or preserue them long, take one of them from the trée, which is neither the ripest nor the gréenest, but betwixt both, and cut it through the midst with your knife, not longwise, but ouerthwart, and then looke into the coare where the kirnells lye, and if it be hollow so as the kirnells lye as it were hollow therein, the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends thereof being turned either blacke, or blackish, albeit the complexion of the Peare be little, or not at all altered, yet the Peares haue their full growth, and may very well be gathered: then laying them either vpon a bedde of ferne, or straw, one vpon another, in great thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, their owne naturall heate will in short space ripen them, which you shall perceiue both by the spéedy chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their colour, &amp; the strength of their smell, which will be excéeding suffocating, which as soone as you perceiue, you shall then spread them thinner and thinner, vntill they be all ripe, and then lay them one by one, in such sort as they may not touch one another, and then they will last much the longer, you shall also after they be ripe, neither suffer them to haue straw nor ferne vnder them, but lay them either vpon some smooth table, boards or fleakes of wands, and they will last the longer.</p>

Now for such as in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their fruit doe euery time that the basket is full bring it downe themselues from the trée, and empty it by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the fruit rudely, and boystrously forth, or for beating of fruit downe with long poales, loggets, or such like, they are both most vilde and preposterous courses, the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of too much foolish and carelesse trouble, the latter of too much disorder, &amp; cruelty, ruyning in a moment what hath béene many yéeres in building: as for the climbing the trée with a ladder, albeit it be a very good way for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of fruit, yet if it be neuer so little indiscréetly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it as much hazardeth the breaking and bruising both of the fruit and the small cyons, as either climbing the trée, or any other way whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>Now for the gathering of your Apples:<note place="margin">

                  </note> you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that your summer fruit, as your Ieniting, Wibourne, and such like, are first to be gathered, whose ripenesse, you may partly know by the change of colour, partly by the pecking of Birds, but cheifely by the course formerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed for your knowledge of the ripenesse of the Peare, which is the hollownesse of coare, and liberty of the kirnell
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12353:80"/>
onely, and when you doe perceiue they are ripe, you shall gather them in such wise as hath béene declared for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of your Peares, without respecting the state of the Moone, or any such like obseruation, but when you come to gather your Winter-fruit, which is the Pippin, Peare-maine, Russetting, Blacke-annat, and such like, you shall in any wise gather them in the wane of the Moone, and, as before I said, in the dryest season that may be, and if it be so that your store be so great that you cannot gather all in that season, yet you shall get so much of your principall fruit, the youngest and fairest, as is possible to be gotten, and preserue it for the last which you intend either to spend, or vtter. Now for the manner of gathering your Apples I doe not thinke you can amend or approue a better way then that which hath béene discribed for the gathering of Peares, yet some of our late practitioners (who thinke themselues not cunning if they be not curious) dislike that way, and will onely haue a gathering apron, into which hauing gathered their fruit, they doe empty it into larger vessells: this gathering apron is a strong péece of Canuas at least an ell euery way, which hauing the vpper end made fast about a mans necke, &amp; the neather end with thrée loopes, that is, one at each corner, &amp; one in the midst, through which you shall put a string, and binde it about your waste, in so much that both the sides of your apron being open you may put your fruit therein with which hand you please: this manner of gathering Apples is not amisse, yet in my conceit the apron is so small a defence for the Apples, that if it doe but knocke against the boughes as you doe moue your selfe, it cannot chuse but bruise the fruit very much, which ought euer to be auoyded: therefore still I am of this opinion, there is no better way, safer, nor more easie, then gathering them into a small basket, with a long line thereat, as hath béene before declared in the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Peares. Now you shall carefully obserue in emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one basket into another, that you doe it so gently as may be, least in powring them out too rudely the stalkes
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:12353:80"/>
of the fruit doe pricke one another, which although it doe appeare little or nothing at the first, yet it is the first ground, cause, and beginning of rottennesse, and therefore you shall to your vttermost power gather your Apples with as small stalkes as may be, so they haue any at all, which they must néedes haue, because that as too bigge stalkes doth pricke and bruise the fruit, so to haue none at all makes the fruit rot first in the place where the stalke should be: you shall also kéepe your fruit cleane from leaues, for they being gréene and full of moisture, when by reason of their lying close together they beginne to wither they strike such an heate into the Apples, that they mil-dew and rot instantly.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12353:81"/>
shall couer them all ouer with ferne also, but for such as you would haue take all possible leasure in ripening, those you shall say neither vpon ferne, nor straw, but vpon the bare boards, nay, if you lay them vpon a plaster floare (which is of all floares the coldest) till Saint Andrewes tide, it is not amisse, but very profitable, and the thinner you say them so much the better. Now if you haue any farre iourney to carry your Apples, either by land, or by water, then trimming and lyning the insides of your bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets with ferne, or wheate-straw wouen as it were cleane through the basket, you shall packe, couer, and cord vp your Apples, in such sort as you did your Peares, and there is no danger in the transportation of them, be it by shippe, cart, waggon, or horse-backe. If you be inforced to packe sundry sorts of Apples in one basket, sée that betwixt eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sort you lay a diuision of straw, or ferne, that when they are vnpackt, you may lay them againe seuerally: but if when they are vnpackt, for want of roome you are compeld to lay some sorts together, in any wise obserue to mixe those sorts together which are nearest of taste, likest of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and all of one continuance in lasting: as for the pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp of fruit in hogsheads, or shooting them vnder hatches when you transport them by Sea, I like neither of the courses, for the first is too close, and nothing more then the want of ayre doth rot fruit, the other is subiect to much wet, when the breach of euery Sea indangereth the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apples, and nothing doth more certainely spoyle them. The times most vnseasonable for the transporting of fruit, is either in the month of March, or generally in any frosty weather, for if the sharpe coldenesse of those ayres doe touch the fruit, it presently makes them looke blacke, and riuelled, so that there is no hope of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>

                  </note> wherefore the first thing to be considered of in this worke, is the goodnesse and aptnesse of the ground for the bringing forth of the fruit thereof, wherein I thus farre consent with Maister <hi>Scot,</hi> that I doe not so much respect the writings, opinions, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, of the Gréeke, Latine, or French authors, who neuer were acquainted with our soyles, as I doe the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practise and experience which I collect, both from my owne knowledge, and the labours of others my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, best séene and approued in this Art: therefore to come to my purpose, you shal vnderstand that the light sand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be redde or white, being simple and vnmixed is most vnfit for the planting of Hoppes, because that through the barrainenesse, it neither hath comfort for the roote, nor through his seperate lightnesse, any strong hould to maintaine and kéepe vp the poales: likewise the most fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till rich, blackeclay, which of all soyles is the best and most fruitfull, is not to be allowed for a Hoppe garden, because his fatnesse and iuyce is so strong that the roote being as it were ouer-fedde, doth make the branches bring forth leaues in such infinite abundance that they leaue neither strength nor place for the fruit, either to knit, or put forth his treasure, as I haue séene by experience in many places: as for the earth which is of a morish, blacke, wet nature, and lyeth low, although I haue often times séene good Hoppes to grow thereupon, being well trencht, and the

These poales you shall cut and prepare betwixt the feast of Al-Saints, and Christmas, and so pile them vp in some dry place, where they may take no wet, vntill it be midde-Aprill, at which time (your Hoppes being shot out of the ground at least thrée quarters of a yarde, so that you may discerne the principall cyons which issue from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall rootes) you shall then bring your poales into the garden, and lay them along in the alleyes, by euery hill so many poales as shall be sufficient for the maine branches, which happely the first yéere will not be aboue two or thrée poales at the most to a hill, but in processe of time more, as foure or fiue, according to the prosperitie of the plants, and the largenesse of the hils.

               <p>Now, if it happen after your Hoppes are growne vp, yet not come to their full perfection, that any of your poales chance to breake, you shall then take a new poale, and with some soft gréene rushes, or the inmost gréene barke of an Alder-trée, tye the toppe of the Hoppe to the toppe of the new poale, then draw the broken poale out of the Hoppe (I meane that part which being broken lyeth vpon the ground) and as you saw it did winde about the olde poale (which is euer the same way that the sunne runnes) so you shall winde it about the new poale: then loosening the earth a little from the neather part of the broken poale, you may with your owne strength pull it cleane out of the earth, and place the new poale in his roome. Now, there be some which are excéeding curious in pulling vp these olde poales, and rather then they will shake the earth, or loosen the mould, they will make a paire of large pincers, or tarriers of iron, at least fiue foote long with sharpe téeth, and a clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hooke, to hould the téeth together, when they haue taken fast hould vpon the poale so neare the earth as is possible, and then laying a peice of woode vnder the tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and poysing downe the other ends to rest the poale out of the earth without any disturbance, the modell or fashion of which instrument is contained in this figure:

                  </note>There be some which are of opinion that if you doe not dry your Hoppes at all, it shall be no losse, but it is an errour most grose, for if they be not dryed, there is neither profit in their vse, nor safty in preseruing them.</p>
               <p>As soone as your Hoppes are sufficiently dryed, you shall by the plucking vp of the foure corners of your hayre-cloath thrust all your Hoppes together, and then putting them into baskets, carry them into such dry places as you haue prepared of purpose to lay them in, as namely, either in dry-fats, or in garners, made either of plaster, or boards: and herein you shall obserue to packe them close and hard together, which will be a meanes that if any of them be not dry, yet the heate they shall get by such lying will dry them fully and make them fit for seruice.</p>

                  </note>Now to conclude, if your store of Hoppes be so great that you shall trade or make Marchandize of them, then either to conuay them by land or Sea, it is best that you packe them into great bagges of canuas, made in fashion of those bagges which woole-men vse, and call them pockets,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:12353:92"/>
but not being altogether so large: these bagges you shall open, and either hang vp betwéene some crosse-beames, or else let downe into some lower floare, and then putting in your Hoppes cause a man to goe into the bagge and tread downe the Hoppes, so hard as is possible, pressing downe basket-full after basket-full, till the bagge be filled, euen vnto the toppe, and then with an extraordinary packe-thridde, sowing the open end of the bagge close together, let euery hollow place be crammed with Hoppes, whilst you can get one hand-full to goe in, and so hauing made euery corner strong and fast, let them lye dry till you haue occasion either to shippe or cart them. And thus much for the ordering of Hoppes, and their vses.</p>

Besides, if no gardens should be planted but in the best and richest soyles, it were infinite the losse we should sustaine in our priuate profit, and in the due commendations, fit for many worthy workmen, who haue reduced the worst and barrainest earths to as rare perfection and profit as if they

               <p>But to returne to my purpose touching the choise of your earth for a garden, sith no house can conueniently be without one, and that our English Nation is of that great popularitie, that not the worst place thereof but is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly inhabited, I thinke it méete that you refuse no earth whatsoeuer to plant your garden vpon, euer obseruing this rule, that the more barraine it is, the more cost must be bestowed vpon it, both in Manuring, digging, and in trenching, as shall be shewed hereafter, and the more rich it is, lesse cost of such labour, and more curiositie in wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, proyning, and trimming the earth: for, as the first is too slow, so the latter is too swift, both in her increase and multiplication.</p>

by that meanes both the eye shall be deceiued (which shewes art in the workman) and the more leuell they are, the more ease vnto them which shall continually walke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He adornation and beautifying of gardens is not onely diuers but almost infinite the industry of mens braines hourely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and bringing forth such new gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and imbroadery for the earth, that it is impossible to say this shall be singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, neither can any man say that this or that is the best, sith as mens tastes so their fancies are carried away with the varietie of their affections, some being pleased with one forme, some with another: I will not therefore giue preheminence to any one beauty, but discribing the faces and glories of all the best ornaments generaly or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly vsed in our English gardens, referre euery man to the ellection of that which shall best agrée with his fancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of Knots and Mazes.</hi>
                  </note>To beginne therefore with that which is most antient and at this day of most vse amongst the vulgar though least respected with great ones, who for the most part are wholy giuen ouer to nouelties: you shall vnderstand that Knots and Mazes were the first that were receiued into admiration, which Knots or Mazes were placed vpon the faces of each seuerall quarter, in this sort: first, about the verdge or square of the quarter was set a border of Primpe, Boxe, Lauandar, Rose-mary, or such like, but Primpe or Boxe is the best, and it was set thicke, at least eightéene inches broad at the bottome &amp; being kept with cliping both smooth and leuell on the toppe and on each side, those bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as they were ornaments so were they also very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12353:100"/>
to the huswife for the drying of linnen cloaths, yarne, and such like: for the nature of Boxe and Primpe being to grow like a hedge, strong and thicke, together, the Gardiner, with his sheares, may kéepe it as broad &amp; plaine as himselfe listeth. Within this border shall your knot or maze be drawne, it being euer intended that before the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of your border your quarter shall be the third time digged, made exceeding leuell, and smooth, without clot or stone, and the mould, with your garden rake of iron, so broken that it may lye like the finest ashes, and then with your garden mauls, which are broad boards of more then two foote square set at the ends of strong staues, the earth shall be beaten so hard and firme together that it may beare the burthen of a man without shrinking. And in the beating of the mould you shall haue all diligent care that you preserue and kéepe your leuell to a hayre, for if you faile in it, you faile in your whole worke.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:12353:101"/>Now for the time of this labour, it is euer best about the beginning of February, and indifferent, about the midst of October, but for the setting of your Primpe, or Boxe-border, let the beginning of Nouember be your latest time, for so shall you be sure that it will haue taken roote, and the leafe will flourish in the spring following: at which time your ground being thus artificially prepared, you shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to draw forth your knot in this manner: first, with lines you shall draw the forme of the figure next before set downe, and with a small instrument of iron make it vpon the earth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Which done, from the order and proportion of these lines you shall draw your single knots or plaine knots of the least curiositie, as may appeare by this figure, being one quarter of the whole Knot: euer proportioning your Trayles and windings according to the lines there discribed, which will kéepe your worke in iust proportion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:12353:101"/>But if you desire to haue knots of much more curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being more double and intricate, then you shall draw your first lines after this proportion here figured, pinning downe euery line firme to the earth with a little pinne made of woode.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Which done you shall draw your double and curious knots after the manner of the figure following, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so but one quarter of the whole knot, for looke in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you doe one knot in like sort will the other thrée quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters succéede, your lines kéeping you in a continuall euen proportion.</p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>And in this manner as you draw these knots, with the like helps and lines also you shall draw out your Mazes, and laborinths, of what sort or kind soeuer you please, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be round or square. But for as much, as not onely the <hi>Country-farme,</hi> but also diuers other translated bookes, doe at large describe the manner of casting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning these knots, I will not persist to write more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously vpon them, but wish euery painefull gardiner which coueteth to be more satisfied therein, to repaire to those authors, where hee shall finde more large amplifications, and greater diuersities of knots, yet all tending to no more purpose then this which I haue all ready written.</p>
               <p>Now, as soone as you haue drawne forth and figured your knot vpon the face of your quarter, you shall then set it either with Germander, Issoppe, Time, or Pinke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilly-flowers,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:12353:102"/>
but of all hearbes Germander is the most principall best for this purpose: diuers doe vse in knots to set Thrift, and in time of néed it may serue, but it is not so good as any of the other, because it is much subiect to be slaine with frost, and will also spread vpon the earth in such sort that, without very painefull cutting, it will put your knot out of fashion.</p>
               <p>Now there is another beautifying or adorning of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and it is most generally to be séene in the gardens of Noblemen and Gentlemen, which may beare coate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and that is, instead of the knots and mazes formerly spoken of, to draw vpon the faces of your quarters such Armes, or Ensines, as you may either beare your selfe, or will preserue for the memory of any friend: and these armes being drawne forth in plaine lines, you shall set those plaine shadowing lines either with Germander, Issop, or such like hearbes: and then for the more ample beautie thereof, if you desire to haue them in their proper and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colours (without which they haue but one quarter of their luster) you shall vnderstand that your colours in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory are thus to be made. First, for your mettalls: you shall make your Yeallow,<note place="margin">

                  </note> both for the naturall property belonging to your Garden, as also for better continuance and long lasting, you shall make of Camomill, well planted where any such colour is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:12353:103"/>
to be vsed, as for the rest of the colours, you shall sift them, and strow them into their proper places, and then with a flat beating-Béetell you shall beate it, and incorporate it with the earth, and as any of the colours shall decay, you shall diligently repaire them, and the luster will be most beautifull.</p>
               <p>There is also another beautifying of gardens, which although it last not the whole yéere, yet it is most quaint, rare, and best eye-pleasing, and thus it is: you shall vpon the face of your quarter draw a plaine double knot, in manner of billet-wise: for you shall vnderstand that in this case the plainest knot is the best, and you shall let it be more then a foote betwixt line and line (for in the largenesse consists much beauty) this knot being scored out, you shall take Tiles, or tileshreds, and fixe them within the lines of your knot strongly within the earth, yet so as they may stand a good distance aboue the earth and this doe till you haue set out all your knot with Tile: then precisely note the seuerall passages of your knot, and the seuerall thrids of which it consisteth, and then betwxit your tiles, (which are but as the shadowing lines of your knot) plant in euery seuerall third, flowers of one kinde and colour, as thus for example: in one thrid plant your carnation Gilly-flower, in another your great white Geli flower, in another your mingle-coloured Gilly-flower, and in another your blood-red Gilly-flower; and so likewise if you can compasse them you may in this sort plant your seueral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Many other adornations and beautifyings there are which belong to the setting forth of a curious garden, but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12353:103"/>

After you haue planted your Abri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot, or other delicate fruit, and plasht him vp against a wall in manner as hath béene before declared, you shall ouer the tops of the trées all along the wall, build a large pentisse, of at least sixe or seauen foote in length: which pentisse ouer-shaddowing the trées, will, as experience hath found out, so defend them, that they will euer beare in as plentifull manner as they haue done any particular yéere before.
