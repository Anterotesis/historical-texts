         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PROLOGUE to the impartial Reader.</head>
            <p>THe cauſes wherefore I write to this Preacher are three in number,
the firſt is, That all the warres of the three Nations were not only
contrived by the ſpeciall advice and means of the Lordly Preachers,
who both lived in ſtately Palaces, and were the chief aſſociates of
Kings; but likewiſe all along theſe troubles, they whiles they had any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and authority remaining on their ſide, gave ſpeciall directions to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Preachers for blowing the bellows to the fire of contention, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
railings and threatnings in their Pulpits; although many of thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizers
have been, and are ſtill in fatter Benefices, than they were even
when they uſed all their flatteries, both with cap in hand and bowed knees, to
thoſe their Lords and Masters; yea and though divers of them have not
ceaſed from conſpiring againſt the preſent State, whereof one was made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary,
as there was one likewiſe of the Prelates to all the reſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, That whatſoever digreſſions, falſe doctrines, and unjuſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
either the ſuperiour or inferiour ſort of thoſe ſelf-ſeeking men
were pleaſed to deliver in publique, from ſuch texts of Scripture, as they
commonly uſed (or rather abuſed) to ſerve their preſent occaſions, even to
alienate the Peoples <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ctions from truth and godlineſs to falſhood and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs;
and ſo by that and other deceitfull means at laſt, to unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
Wars, there was no man of whatſomever degree (who was then
called a Subject) throughout all the three Nations, that durſt upon pain of
his life, yea and estate too, if he had any, oppoſe the meaneſt of thoſe Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in that place, and at that time, I mean, immediately after they had
finiſhed their Sermon, although it pleaſeth God to give all the men of any
Church abſolute liberty to oppoſe as need doth require, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 29, 30,
31. So that whatſoever expreſſions thoſe hirelings uttered in their Pulpits,
were generally received both by moſt of the vulgar, and all the profane mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
even better oftentimes than if they had been the Oracles of God: and
as for the learned Nobility, Gentry, Judges, Lawyers, Phyſicians and chief
Citizens, who for the moſt part had more illumination than ſanctification,
verily their lands, poſſeſſions, riches &amp; great trades, yea and fear both of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
and want of thoſe their periſhing gods, proved like as many gaggs to
ſtop their deceitful mouths; as that young rich man menti<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned in the Goſpel,
<pb facs="tcp:118156:3"/>
who alleged that he had kept the whole Law of God from his youth, and yet
lacked the doing only of one thing, did chuſe rather to leave Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than to do
that thing, though it was as ſubject to periſh in the uſing, as he himſelf was in
his mortall condition.</p>
            <p>And the third cauſe is, That ſeeing after three moneths patient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
either of ſome courſe or other to have been taken concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
attempt of t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at ſhameleſs woman in this Letter mentioned, or at
leaſt ſome well-affected parties to have written their minds unto this Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
therein, he being the mouth of that high Aſſembly; I to ſupply the laſt
and leaſt of theſe defects, though not in the meaſure I could wiſh, but in
the manner I am (through divine Providence) abl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, (being all thoſe moneths
ſick, as yet I am not well) have thought it a part both of my Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and as a well-wiſher to this Commonwealth, even to write unto him, both
for mine own and many other peoples ſatisfaction, yea and undeceiving of all
the three Nations, even to know the cauſes or reaſons of his ſilence and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
both in ſo pertinent a time, and ſo urgent a buſineſs as is here trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he being the only man who might, if not to have prevented, yet to have
gotten remedied both whatſoever was amiſſe then, or hath, by means and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of the very ſame his ſilence and negligence, occurred ſince.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as upon other occaſions both of enormities, defects and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of ſome peoples carriages, I have, through Gods aſſiſtance, uſed my best
endeavours according to my liberty, in witneſſing againſt ſuch irregular
things; Even ſo through the ſame aſſiſtance, I have here concerning this
matter, done the like to this Preacher, who of a hundred I would not have
expected, that any ſuch abſurd act ſhould have ſo publikly eſcaped his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
and ſo much the rather, in that he was not only interrupted on his
ſtage, from acting his own part, whereby all his Auditors for a time became
ſpectators of the other impudent act, but carefully attending likewiſe what
after his ſo long ſilence he would expreſſe: I wiſh that the matter here writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as it is both illuſtrated and compared with others of the like nature, may
ſink ſo deeply both in his heart and all theirs whom it doth eſpecially, or may
any wiſe concern, that they may not only repent both publikely and privately
for this ſo hainous and notorious an offence to God and his People, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
all the reſt of their dayes bring forth ſuch fruits worthy amendment of
life, that through Gods grace they may learn to walk in the way of wiſdom,
chriſtianity, modesty and ſobriety. <hi>Fare-well.</hi>

               <salute>Mr. Sterry,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough neither I know you, nor, I ſuppoſe,
you me by face, yet in regard that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
hoped better things of you, in that
you ſerved the late worthy Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi>
than of many others of your profeſſion,
and that there is a ſtrange report of a very
barbarous act, or miſdemeanour of very
high nature, which hath lately occurred,
where you, by your Miniſteriall office,
might have charged thoſe that had power,
to have timely redreſſed; and it's confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by many credible perſons, whereof ſome were both eye and ear
witneſſes; which is no leſſe grievous to the Godly, than ridiculous to
the wicked; I am therefore the more earneſt to intreat you by theſe lines,
that you will be pleaſed to declare unto me, by your direct anſwer in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the true cauſes or reaſons of your ſilence, which is uſually taken for
conſent ſeeing you only filled up the room of your Pulpit, much worſe
than any meer or bare cipher, which although of it ſelf it ſignifieth no
value of any thing, yet it maketh moſt of all the figures about it, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token
a far greater value than they would without it, whiles a ſignifying
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118156:4"/>
figure is not in place of it; for you made all the well-affected about you,
yea and of all theſe united Nations much worſe, both through grief
and evill example of that your ſilence and negligence, beſides the
ſtrengthning of the wicked in that reſpect, you being eſteemed to have
been far more conſcionable, than to have been ſo utterly careleſſe in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a needfull point of your duty, as it doth ſeem to many even to
be a conniving with ſuch a brutiſh and vile attempt, both at ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
time, and in ſuch an eminent place, which indeed doth greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
your reputation, in that you was the only man then appointed,
or at leaſt allowed to be the mouth, paſtor, overſeer, and watchman of
that honourable aſſembly; howſoever, I conceive you both was and
are there in the generall or common way of the Nationall practice, and
not according to the conſtitution, purity, ſincerity, nor order of the
totally ſeparated Churches mentioned in Chriſts glorious Goſpel, See
<hi>Rom. 7. 4, 5, 6. 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4, 5, 6. with abundance
of other places, which would be tedious to expreſſe.</p>
            <p>Again, to go another way to worke, both for the better ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the depth, trying to find out the ſecrecie of this moſt barbarous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
in ſuch a civilized Nation, chiefly by the ſpirituall illumination
of the Goſpell, and that muſt be by ſerious conſideration of all the
circumſtances ſo pretermitted, and not regarded, but ſmoothed over
by your ſilence; neither King <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of mankind, nor any
other writer of the Scripture, did ever forbid any wiſe or diſcreet man, to
ſpeak in time and place convenient, if they have a lawfull call, charge,
or office to that purpoſe, but only all fools whatſoever or whoſoever
they be, and that becauſe they lack wiſdom and diſcretion to diſcern
between good and evill; and I am confident that its a greater and more
inexcuſable fault for a wiſe and diſcreet man to be ſilent, when in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
diſcharge of his office, he ought of neceſſity to ſpeak, than for a
ſimple fool when he ſhould hold his peace, even freely to deliver his
mind, although it ſhould not be pertinent to the matter in hand; for
the one may do both much good, and hinder much evill, by his timely,
diſcreet and wiſe ſpeech, as <hi>Huſhai</hi> did to King <hi>David,</hi> but the other
can doe little either good or evill, by his unadviſed and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſpeech; for the firſt hath not only a call appropriated to his
function to ſpeak, but likewiſe wiſdom, diſcretion, moderation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
reaſon, and it may be religion alſo, all concurring to enable
him; whereas the ſecond is deſtitute and void of all theſe gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yea, and cannot by any kind of human endeavours reach to the
true underſtanding of any ſuch precious favours. But the ſame divine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118156:4"/>
Author ſpeaketh ſometimes of thoſe wicked fooles, who having too
much knowledge, though little true wiſdom, do uſe it as a weapon of
unrighteouſneſs, even to offend the almighty and great God of whom
they received it, in that they are thereby as much enabled as they are
willing to offend his people, which he always accounts, as an injury done
to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Moreover, by the way, it will be no leſſe needfull than ſeaſonable, to
ſhew an Example very worthy (I ſuppoſe) both of your, mine own,
and all mens obſervation, not for a day, a week, a month, a year,
but whiles we are in this mortality; I knew a man about 30 years ago,
that being an older teacher (I think) than you are in years, who being
all his time untill the laſt year of his life (to my beſt remembrance) in
ſo high eſteem for the excellency of his gifts, and gravity of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
too, (ſo far as man could diſcern) that King <hi>James</hi> often hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him, and his name being Maſter <hi>John Hall,</hi> did call him Maſter
<hi>Iohn All (ſine aſpiratione</hi>) meaning, that the true copy of all the
knowledge, memory, learning, expreſſion, and diverſity of gifts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
in a preacher of the word, which were reſpectively in all others
of that nation at leaſt, were fully regiſtred and found in him alone, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only the ſhortneſſe of his tongue, whereby the ripeneſſe of hs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and ſpeedineſſe of his delivery did precipitate and out-run ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
people who were of dull or ſlow apprehenſion; but he proving at
laſt, when perſecution began to ariſe for the Goſpell (never being
acquainted with the feeling, but only with the hearing and reading
thereof before) to be ſuch an open hypocrite and hireling, that he
quite left thoſe his ſimple ſheep, by whoſe yeerly Fleeces he was very
richly and conſtantly maintained with all his family, as their Paſtor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
forty years ſpace, even when both the great Woolf him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and all his hungry followers, came to tear and devoure them
to peeces</p>
            <p>Yet a little while afterwards, when his Conſcience began to be wakened
for his moſt hainous ſins, and receiving (I hope) a little blink of Chriſt's
joyfull countenance, as <hi>Peter</hi> who alſo denyed him in another caſe had
in the hall of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and he being aſhamed to be ſeen any more in the
ſtreets, if he had been an univerſal Monarch, he would have given the
whole world for licence onely to have preached one Sermon more on a
firſt day in that moſt eminent City of the Nation, and chief high-place
thereof, unto which he was externally advanced, and that (as may in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his great earneſtneſs afterward appear to be wel conjectured) to
have asked forgiveneſs publickly both of God and all his Flock, for his ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118156:5"/>
ſinful, undutifull, and ingratefull both offending his infinite Majeſty, and
them, and that merely for fear to incur the indignation, or (at worſt) the
perſecution of a finite and periſhing Majeſty, even by leaving and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them to the arbitrary will and luſt of that implacable enemy, that
he might impoſe upon them all the groſs Popery both tranſacted
between him and the Pope long before that time, and intended to have
been begun there, and then, both by the military and all other witty aid
of that nature, after they had embraced the ſame, even to have brought
it with a high hand here, they being alwayes (by their travels abroad)
expert in wars, and this Nation in long peace, and out of uſe untill of
late years; which buſineſs becauſe he was not able to effect in his own
dayes, therefore, even as King <hi>David</hi> gave his Sonne <hi>Solomon</hi> charge to
deal with <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Shimei</hi> after his death, ſo he left his Sonne to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
that <hi>Romiſh</hi> deſign to his utmoſt power after he was gone; and in
reference thereunto, upon his and the Biſhops of both Nations urging
that groſſe Service-Book in that Nation, untill the reſt of that poyſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtuff ſhould have followed, all the cruell Wars throughout all the
three Nations, which have been almoſt ever ſince, have procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it may be upon good grounds imagined, that this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Preacher not only intended to have given his beſt advice to his
Flock, as his laſt Will and Teſtament, even to ſtand faſt in the liberty
wherewith Chriſt hath made them free, and not to be entangled again
with the yoke of bondage: but likewiſe as touching his own grievous fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
to have intreated them, That they would be pleaſed (out of their
tender compaſſion towards his everlaſting weal) to adde their fervent
prayers to his, for mercy and reconciliation to him, through a lively faith
laying hold on the all-ſufficient merits of Ieſus Chriſt, before he ſhould
goe hence and be ſeen no more, and to have beſought them, that as they
hoped to be ſaved at the great day of Retribution, never to make his nor
any other mens wanderings their examples to reiterate and follow, but
altogether as ſo many terrors (like Sea-marks or Beacons ſet on Rocks)
for ſhips to avoid and eſchew: And concerning the event of what great
diligence his friends and acquaintances (howſoever very numerous and
powerfull) did uſe, to have obtained the Licence before mentioned, both
of ſuperiour and inferiour powers, they being often reproved for ſo high
an attempt, which then was ſo hot in proſecution; after they were long
delayed, at laſt, they were abſolutely refuſed: whereupon in great grief,
but I hope with ſuch godly ſorrow as through Chriſt he found mercy,
God himſelf favourably accepting the will for the deed, and private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118156:5"/>
when publick is hindered by man, he finiſhed his courſe.</p>
            <p>By whoſe example, even from the beginning to the ending of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
all of us, yea the beſt of us, have very great need to obſerve,
that we ought not upon any kind of terms, preferments, promiſes, bribes
(now called gratuities) fears, terrors, threatnings, loſſes, yea or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
it ſelf, though inflicted in the higheſt degree, that either Sathan
or his Inſtruments can deviſe, to deny Chriſt before men, and that by
walking contrary to the purity of his Goſpell, if we any wiſe aim at the
glory of God, and ſalvation of our own ſoules, at the great day of his
glorious appearing, and confeſſing us before his heavenly Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to
work out our ſalvation in fear and trembling, and to make our calling
and election ſure by wel-doing, chiefly in performing all and whatſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
our duties, both ſpiritual and temporal, to our utmoſt in due time,
even whiles it is called to day, and not boaſt off untill to morrow, becauſe
we know not what a day may bring forth; for time is one of the moſt
precious jewels under the Sun, and upon the well or ill ſpending of time
dependeth Eternity either of weal or wo.</p>
            <p>But to conclude all theſe firſt particulars tending to the dehortation of
all people from ſuch a ſhameleſſe attempt as is here with great deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
witneſſed againſt, and inſiſt alſo in another ſort thereof, before we
adhere to the matter it ſelf, wherein I ſhall be as brief as is requiſite; if
King <hi>Solomon</hi> who wrot by the inſpiration of the Spirit, did not only ſay,
That a word in his place is like Diamonds of gold ſet in pictures of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
but likewiſe did direct every man who hath received knowledge, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to doe or deviſe any temporal work for the benefit of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
not to delay the ſame, but to accompliſh it with all their power;
then how much more ought thoſe who are intruſted with any kind of
charge, to perform their duties to their utmoſt, chiefly when they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpirituall, or tend to any ſpirituall uſe? Yea, and he alſo giveth ſuch
a ſtrong reaſon as can admit of no oppoſition; For (ſaith he) there is
neither work, nor invention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom, in the grave
whither thou goeſt.</p>
            <p>And as in one reſpect, modeſtie be ſufficient to make any ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
both very much grieved and perplexed, only to mention that moſt
preſumptuous and impudent act, both for matter and manner as it came
to paſſe, even by one of the female ſex, whoſe duty was to have been moſt
ſhamefac'd, chiefly as it tendeth to open, univerſall, avowed and allowed
wickedneſſe; though I know by undoubted proof, that all ſuch abſurd
things, are utterly abhorred by divers both of thoſe Worthies that ſit at
the helm, and of thoſe alſo who under God defend them by the ſword:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118156:6"/>
ſo in another reſpect, howſoever neceſſity may ſeem to require an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
both of the matter and manner thereof, becauſe the ſame may be
a ſpeciall means to move both that ſtrange-like woman, and ſuch others
as be guiltie, either of that ſhameleſſe act, or the like, unto a godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
for I hear there are many ſprung up of late in and about this ſinfull
City; yet in regard of the wicked and profane ſort, who (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith)
make a mock of ſin, its far more expedient (as I conceive) that it be
henceforth concealed, than any more, chiefly in Print, revealed,
even to avoid imitation, as its ſaid; there was no particular law made,
forbidding any man to kill his Father, but in generall, that no man
ſhould doe any murther: And that Sir, you and I may know one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
mind, in order to the ſatisfaction both of me (who in ſtead of a
better, doe here write unto you for that purpoſe) and of many thouſands
of others, who have only heard of your name in that particular, and daily
after ſo long delay, do ardently expect the ſame, yea, and doubtleſs will
be very ready henceforth both to ſpeak and reſpect of you according as
you ſhall be able and willing to clear your ſelf by your punctual anſwer,
concerning your ſo countenancing with ſilence, ſuch a notorious evill, as
I much doubt if any record can parallel.</p>
            <p>Again, you know its upon divine record, That Queen <hi>Vaſthi</hi> the wife
of King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> (though a Heathen as well as he) ſo preferred her
modeſty, ſobriety, and chaſtity above all other earthly things ſhe could
loſe, that ſhe abſolutely refuſed at an inconvenient time to humor the
King her husband ſo much, as to vouchſafe to come unto that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Feaſt, when he was merry with Wine, amongſt the midſt of his chief
Princes, Nobles and People, though in a very ſolemn manner he himſelf
ſent not only his chiefeſt Officers, but likewiſe the Crown-Royall for
her, even to ſhew his Princes, Nobles and People her beauty, for ſhe
was fair to look on; and doubtleſſe had the richeſt both jewels and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
as well as apparell, wherewith to deck her ſelf, that the world
could afford, her husband being ſo great a Monarch, that he had a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſeven and twenty Provinces under his juriſdiction and command,
yea and of ſuch a noble and ingenuous diſpoſition likewiſe, as appeared
concerning his unrequired, but not undeſerved thankfulneſſe to <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
though he was both a ſtranger to him, and one of another Nation as
well as Religion: all which modeſty, ſobriety and gravity of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Queen, yea and diſcretion alſo in obſerving fit times and ſeaſons, as
<hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith there is to all earthly things, do ſo much the more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the evill of that moſt impudent and preſumptuous act, which had
not any the leaſt reaſon or warrant, and far leſſe any call to doe it, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118156:6"/>
this famous Queen had to have appeared in a moſt magnifick order and
manner, before her husband and King: ſo that both that ſhameleſſe
womans preſumption (of whom we ſpeak) and your ſilent beholding
her, even like other ſpectators, whereof many lookt far more on you,
than her, admiring much that you by your Miniſteriall charge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo in the Pulpit and middle of your Sermon, yea, and none other
then having authority to ſpeak, how you in your conſcience could both
in ſo needfull a time, ſo eminent a place, and upon ſo urgent an occaſion,
be ſo negligent in the diſcharge of that your duty as well as the delivery
of your Sermon it ſelf, which alſo you being forced to forbear, during
the time and preſence of that ſhamefull ſpectacle, was the more free to
have expreſſed your mind concerning her miſ-behaviour.</p>
            <p>For you as well know as I can expreſſe, that you ought to have uſed
the beſt and ſpeedieſt means, by the moſt pertinent and moving expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
you could, both unto the Magiſtrates and chief Military Officers
there preſent, even for juſtice of ſuch a preſumptuous and ſhameleſſe
woman for ſo barbarous and uncivill an action, as both at ſo ſolemn a
time and in ſo eminent a place, ſhe ſo unhappily, and I fear too exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily
brought to paſſe, if it be not as exemplarily puniſhed; by which
ſtrange kind of diſturbance not only your ſelf had intermiſſion in the
midſt of your Sermon, but likewiſe all the honorable Auditors diſcredit,
by ſuch a baſe oppoſition: for although you ſaw ſome well-affected
people remove her, without any the leaſt of your aid, encouragement,
yea or allowance, ſo much as a bare word; yet (as I ſaid) you being the
only man that was ſet there to ſpeak, it was your duty ſo to have confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that their worthy act of removing her, that you ſhould have given
them charge likewiſe by vertue of your own Miniſterial charge, to have
kept her cloſe and ſafe from any eſcape, untill the matter had been exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tryed, and ſo much the rather, that the like in our dayes at leaſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
occurred.</p>
            <p>And if ſuch enormities be not permitted where there are neither civill
Magiſtrates, nor temporall puniſhments, without the higheſt ſpirituall
cenſures that can be inflicted, even in any totally ſeparated Church fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all
kind of antichriſtian worſhip, worſhippers, officers, Government, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and high places; then ought not ſuch groſſe, vile, and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
enormities, to be condignly puniſhed in a nationall Church, where
they pretend to have as lawfully the ſpirituall ſword, as they have the
temporall? and ſo much the rather, in that this abſurd act came to paſſe
in one of the chief aſſemblies of this Nation, even by one member both
of your own Church, and Commonwealth before your eys; and as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118156:7"/>
the particulars which by your ſilence were omitted, in that the party
by occaſion of that your negligence was not kept, but eſcaped, (even to
the ſhame of all concerned therein,) they are theſe. 1 She ought to have
been to ſure cuſtody committed, untill the matter had been through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examined, and not (as ſhe was half an hour) for the faſhion ſake, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
ſhe put on her cloathes, even moſt likely by means of ſome either of
her own friends or favorers of her evill ways. 2 She ought to have
been demanded both what were the reaſons and intentions of that her
ſo preſumptuous, impudent, and barbarous attempt? 3 Whether ſuch
kind of laſcivious and licentious cariage, be the cuſtom of the company
where ſhe uſeth to walk? 4 With what Company ſhe walketh? 5 How
long? 6 Whether or no ſhe was ſent by them? 7 If not, then by
whom? 8 If by none at all, then did ſhe not run unſent? 9 What
her name was? 10 If ſhe hath a husband? 11 If yea, what his name was?
12 where he dwelleth? 13 And if he and ſhe live together? So that
by knowing theſe or moſt of theſe particulars, both the neighbours
where they dwell, and others who would have viſited her in her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
might have poſſibly in ſhort time declared divers things
which her ſelf would have alwayes obſcured: But it paſſeth all expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both the multiplicity and diverſity of evils (as was ſaid in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face)
which have come to paſſe in theſe diſtreſſed Nations, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and during theſe deſtructive wars, as well by the ſilence of hundreds

               </gap> your profeſſion, and not preſſing the beſt things, as by their moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
urging the worſt, the Lordly ſort, for the Biſhopricks and Dean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the inferiour ſort, for the Tithes and other antichriſtian forced
maintenance.</p>
            <p>And as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> It's repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(ſaith he) that there is fornication amongſt you, and ſuch fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as is not ſo much as named among the Gentiles, even that one ſhould
have his fathers wiſe; ſo upon ſuch an abominable account, as unto
which that <hi>Sodom</hi>-like act tendeth, though not expedient to be here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
not only a man may have his own mother or ſiſter, but a woman
likewiſe her own father or brother, even like the brute beaſts of the field,
which not being made according to the Image of God, but only ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to ſerve the uſe of man, are not capable of law nor reaſon: ſo that
it may be no leſſe grievouſly than truly ſaid, to the ſin and ſhame of this
Nation, yea and ſcandall both of profeſſion and reformation, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
laſcivious apparell (which ſheweth a licentious life) there be many
ſuch ſtrange ſpectacles as this ſhameleſſe act, now a dayes both in City
and Countrey, to be ſeen day and night, as (I ſuppoſe) the like was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118156:7"/>
ſince the innocency of our firſt parents, neither in theſe Nations nor
any others, in the dayes of the Law nor Goſpel, where there was no
extremity of cold to be endured, or either skins or figtree-leaves where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to be covered: and that eſpecially in ſuch ſad dayes of blood, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
tears, ſighs, groans, depopulations and deſolations; yea and for
any thing I could ever hear, (for I was never to ſee) the like ſhameleſſe
ſpectacle hath not been ſo publikely and impudently ſhewed nor acted
in all the vile ſhews, and whoriſh masks, (where many thouſands of
pounds have been ſpent in one night) even to provoke God to wrath,
and mankind to wickedneſſe, amongſt the groſſeſt either heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
or Popiſh Tyrants of theſe Nations in former times, and not a little
at <hi>Whitehall</hi> Palace before theſe Wars, even where this vile act came to
paſſe, which would be a great ſhame to expreſſe. Only upon the 17th
day of the 5th moneth called <hi>Iuly</hi> 1652. being the firſt day of the week,
a bold woman of about 30 years old, ſober in her ſpeech, came in a moſt
Strumpet-like poſture, mocking you, and that your Sermon of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
and all that honourable Congregation, conſiſting of the
chief States of this Land, who were conveened neither to hear nor behold
any ſports, masks, playes, ſhewes, yea nor to fulfill ſinfull luſts, as mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
both of inferiour Souldiers and others doe frequently in carnall
Whore-houſes; yea, nor to hear the word of man, but as it is indeed,
the bleſſed and good word of the almighty, great, dreadfull, and onely
wiſe God; howſoever by the means of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and his great Deputie,
that man of ſin, and child of perdition, to the great offence of his divine
Majeſty, and all that love the Lord Ieſus in ſincerity, it be for the moſt
part delivered both in unſeaſoned earthen veſſels, like King <hi>Ieroboam's</hi>
Prieſts, and high places alſo like his, yea and moſt of all the ordinances
adminiſtred as well to the profane, as other both ignorant and unfit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who onely make a meer ſhew, but quite deny the power of
godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>It is yet more ſeriouſly to be conſidered by occaſion of this lewd-like
womans eſcape, through your not being ſo zealous even in word, as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
was in deed for God and his people, in getting her puniſhed (if you
be not of her mind, and that ſhe came thither by conſent, as I hope your
anſwer will clear) the reſt of that diabolicall ſect, are not only ſince that
time much more hardened, ſtrengthened and encouraged to proceed in
their profeſſed wickedneſſe, both of renting conſtituted Churches, and
making Gods word of none effect by their infernall inventions; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
their arrogancie and preſumption do reach now unto ſuch a height,
(and ſo much the higher by thus eſcaping and mocking Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118156:8"/>
his ſolemn day, and both mans authority and preſence in keeping
thereof) in that they have begun to beat Miniſters out of their pulpits in
<hi>London,</hi> even on that ſolemn day which he hath ſanctifyed and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for his divine worſhip.</p>
            <p>Thus by your negligence and deficiency in uſing the means to have
had juſtice done in due time, which I verily beleeve the State or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
would not have refuſed upon that Strumpet-like woman, who
durſt be ſo bold in out-facing ſhame, even on the Lords day in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
and midſt of your Sermon, to come in ſuch a poſture which is a
ſhame to expreſſe, and publickly offer ſuch a vile diſgrace, provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
contempt, yea and (as it were) a defyance to God, his ordinances
and people, you (ſo far as I can learn, untill I ſee your anſwer) and
which is alſo the opinion doubtleſſe of multitudes who never heard of
you before, are by your ſilence and negligence the inſtrumentall cauſe
that all of her mind and faction are not only waxed both more audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
outragious and numerous, but likewiſe doe think themſelves to be
more confirmed and allowed, thus by outfacing Authority to proceed in
their wickedneſſe, than ever ſince we heard that there was any ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants
in this valley of tears, according to that worthy ſaying of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 11. Becauſe ſentence againſt an evill work is not ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
executed, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them
to do evill.</p>
            <p>But in order to a redreſſe, I am confident, that if thoſe wanton peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who almoſt like thoſe of old that ſate down to eat and drink and
then roſe up to play, were as ſcarce both of food and rayment as many
of Gods dear children are in theſe long and toylſom days of affliction
(to them, howſoever they be proſperous to others) and not only they
put to work and labour, with exact overſeers to take a ſtrict accompt of
them daily, and that in ſuch ſure places as <hi>Bridewell</hi> in all the Counties
of theſe united Nations; but likewiſe all Thieves that cannot be proved
murtherers, who uſually boaſt, (even which is too evidently true,) that
they care far leſſe for a quarter of an hours hanging, than to work and
labour a moneths time, and ſo the putting of ſuch to death is ſo far from
proving to be warrantable or good, that not only the practice thereof
offendeth the Majeſty of God, in that it croſſeth his ſacred word, but it
never cometh to any ſucceſsfull period: for is there not conſtantly (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all ſuch indirect means uſing) a number of both ſexes exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
both every moneth at <hi>London,</hi> and at every Seſſions and Aſſizes
in the Countries throughout all the three Nations? ſo that there is no
amendment by uſing that moſt unwarrantable and uncharitable means
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118156:8"/>
of mans deviſing: Therefore if the remedie before mentioned of both
theſe evils for recovering thoſe parties in their reſpective degrees and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits
were wiſely and diſcreetly uſed in all theſe united Nations, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it might prove very effectuall, both to abandon the laſciviouſneſſe of
the one ſort, and beſides the obedience in that reſpect to Gods revealed
will, it would ſave the pretious lives of the other, which though one
Iudge can take, who perchance is guilty himſelf of a thouſand times grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
offences, yet thoſe lives cannot be reſtored by all the Iudges of the
world, as the ſtoln goods may in ſome conſiderable time by work and
labour, be to the owner recovered, and ſo the party releaſed.</p>
            <p>And if this moſt charitable, eaſie, profitable, needfull, vertuous and
commendable means were thus tryed, there would not only much glory
redound thereby to God, by obeying his word, and great advantage by
their induſtry to the whole Commonwealth; but likewiſe there might
be an Army of above an hundred thouſand men, alwaies trained, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and in readineſſe upon all occaſions for whatſomever either Sea or
Land ſervices, throughout all the three Nations, either againſt forreign
Invaſions, or inteſtine Inſurrections; and that by chuſing out all the
beſt affected and trained from among them at all needfull times, who
after they have been broken off from their wonted both aſſociates, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and practices, might in ſome conſiderable time, prove as good
ſouldiers under diſcreet and expert Commanders, as any who are at
preſent in thoſe ſervices of the three Nations: ſo that neither any more
preſſing of houſholders, nor ſound of drum for voluntiers ſhould be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but thoſe priſoners happily reduced from being malefactors to be
both manufactors and ſouldiers, yea and many of them to be alſo well
informed in the ſincere wayes of God, from which like loſt Sheep they
have far ſtrayed; thus ſhould theſe Nations be patterns of ſuch godly
and vertuous works to all other Nations, who have not already the uſe
and practice thereof, which yet we want.</p>
            <p>Verily, all honeſt men (who are moſt ſubject to be deceived, they cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
judging the beſt of others to be like them, as I have dearly bought
ſome experience both in that and other kinds) did expect, that when all
the Playhouſes in <hi>London</hi> were quite diſcharged, and alſo that great
Timber barn in the Palace of <hi>Whitehall</hi> it ſelf demoliſhed, which was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
for the vile exerciſes of masks and playes, and thoſe to be alwayes in
the night ſeaſon (even croſſing the Ordinance of God, which he hath
appointed for people to reſt, and in the day to travell) yea and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
of Gods temporall judgements were ſo abundantly powred out in
theſe bloody, cruell, durable and deſtructive Wars throughout all the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118156:9"/>
three Nations for the great abominations and crying ſins thereof, even
when they were ripe for the ſickle, and by which the former State being
quite overthrown, there remained no more excuſes of any inteſtine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
to hinder a thorough and full Reformation, both in matters
ſpirituall and temporall; ſo that long before any forraign troubles began
there might and ſhould have been far better ſeed, proceeding from a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſorrow, not only ſowed but ſprung up, that there might have been a
joyfull reaping before this time, than any more ſuch of the Enemies tares
(though of other kinds, as he wanteth not a magazine of temptations
as God hath of judgements) to have been either in our own days or the
poſterities, which now do begin of freſh ſo to ſpring up and flouriſh,
that if they and their bloſſoms be permitted to bear ſeed and ripen untill
another harveſt, then doubtleſs the laſt error will be worſe than the firſt,
for that will highly provoke God in his juſtice, to powr out both more
remarkable and inevitable judgements than the former.</p>
            <p>We have upon holy record for our learning, or at leaſt for rendering
us the more inexcuſable, abundance of examples, whereof for avoyding
prolixity, I will only mention two of the moſt pregnant and pertinent,
as both times do change, and we alſo change in them, ſome being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the skyes, and others humbled to the aſhes; the Firſt is, That
becauſe the people of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> who being overcom by four
Kings, and through Gods providence in uſing <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Family
as his inſtruments both to deſtroy thoſe Kings, and bring back the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and ſpoil of thoſe Cities, did not walk anſwerable unto ſuch unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
favors, but did wax much worſe in all kind of voluptuouſneſs and
wickedneſs afterwards, than ever they themſelves, or thoſe their friends
and neighbours who were deſtroyed before their eyes; did not the ſame
righteous God then puniſh them to the full, even by an extraordinary
extirpation of them all, ſaving one Family, from off the face of the
earth at laſt, as both he did the whole world in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> and
the <hi>Amalekites</hi> for their cruelty to his own own people, in their diſtreſs?
which wonderfull viſitatious are ſufficient enough to terrify us and all
poſterities from following thoſe wicked people in their moſt hainous
ſins, if our hearts were not hardned (I much fear) as both theirs and
and King <hi>Pharao's</hi> were, unto the day of deſtruction: So that the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites</hi>
ſlight puniſhment at firſt, by ſo many thouſands, who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
were as guilty as the reſt, being freed, (according to the Lords uſuall
remembring mercy in the midſt of his judgments) and yet that ſo great
and undeſerved mercy to thoſe who ſo much enjoyed it, not being in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the leaſt meaſure regarded, but rather their hearts ſo much the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118156:9"/>
more hardened, preſuming if ſuch another viſitation ſhould come again,
that they ſhould have the like eſcape; and upon that falſe ground they
moſt ungratefully and undutifully, (not at all conſidering the goodneſſe
of God towards them,) both increaſed and multiplyed all their former
abominable wickedneſſes: and therefore it may be juſtly ſaid, that that
gentle viſitation by ſo many thouſands of as guilty people as the reſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping
which at firſt in much mercy they had, was no preſervation,
and far leſſe any allowance of them either in their former or latter abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
whereby in the leaſt either ſo ſuddenly or at all to have grown
ſecure, and much leſſe to have proceeded in wickedneſſe; neither was
the victory which God gave them over their enemies, any ſure token of
his favour to them above their brethren in evil whom he had deſtroyed,
but it was rather a reſervation of them, unto a more generall, inevitable,
compleat, remarkable, and extraordinary judgment.</p>
            <p>And the ſecond Example is, that when certain men told our bleſſed
Saviour of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> whoſe blood <hi>P<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lat</hi> had mingled with their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
he anſwered and ſaid unto them, Suppoſe ye that thoſe <hi>Galileans</hi>
were greater ſinners than all other <hi>Galileans,</hi> I tell you, Nay, but except
ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh? Or think ye, that thoſe 18. men
upon whom the Tower in <hi>Shilo</hi> fell and ſlew them, were ſinners above
all that were in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I tell you, Nay, but except ye amend your
lives, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh?</p>
            <p>Sir, I could even in this moſt rare accident, as well as in other matters
which are frequent, much enlarge my ſelf, both from the word of truth,
and occurrences in our own dayes, yea and beſides the dear buying of
ſome experience in other kinds, I have not been at ſmall both charges
and travels, beſides other great loſſes and troubles of perſecution, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
driven by wicked men with my Family, oftentimes from our habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and poſſeſſions, even from one Nation to another, whereby to
gain ſome experience alſo in this kind; For I have not only been divers
times Excommunicated in Nationall Churches by the Prieſts of the high
places, and their Lords, the late Biſhops, even for witneſſing againſt
their manifold evils, either by word, writing, not countenancing their
antichriſtian worſhip, or refuſing to maintain them in ſuch indirect
courſes, by paying Tythes or other exactions, which they call duties,
they neither being Chriſts ſervants, nor content with his wages, although
I was not a member of any National Church theſe 35 years, which is
about the half of my few and evill dayes; but likewiſe I was once Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
in a Church in <hi>London,</hi> where I was a Member indeed in
obedience to Gods Word, which I eſteemed to be of totall ſeparation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118156:10"/>
from all kind of ſuch evills, and to walk in the order and purity of the
Goſpell, even becauſe I proteſted firſt againſt the owners of a diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
boy between 3. and 4. year old, whom both they and all other their
confederat members ſaving one, allowed (as it ſeemed) to trouble the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
both on firſt days, faſt days, and other days of weekly meetings,
for the ſpace of divers moneths, I being the oldeſt in years of any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſaving one Woman, who had no liberty to ſpeak, and for which as I
heard by one of themſelves, that if I inſiſted to have ſuch peace, ſilence
and order obſerved, that they had reſolved I ſhould be Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Secondly, becauſe I witneſſed againſt the evils of divers falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
which were by <hi>Samuel Chidley</hi> one of their Teachers delivered,
and by the ignorant members received. And Thirdly, becauſe I both
diſcovered, and after privat dealing with him brought famous Witneſſes
to prove many haynous ſins againſt him, for which he was caſt out of
<hi>Worceſter</hi> houſe from the States ſervice, which I both procured for him,
taught him, and kept him in it two years, after he was depoſed, until he
got great riches, and notice of diſcoveries, to my own great prejudice,
through his deceitfulneſſe, and the beſt recompence I received for all I
was Excommunicated, which as one of Gods chief Ordinances, he and
his Confederates moſt unjuſtly uſed, as a weapon of unrighteouſneſſe,
whereby to execute their malice againſt me, even to their own ſin and
ſhame, for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, As the Swallow and Sparrow by flying doe
eſcape, ſo the curſe that is cauſleſſe ſhall not come.</p>
            <p>And beſides all theſe, whereof I have the particulars, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worthy matters ready for the Preſſe, I and my Family once, even
upon an occaſion alſo of a Sermon, where there were about 2000 peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
gathered to a Fair neer <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where we had a houſe and dwelt
in the Summer time, and we being a long time warned according to the
penalties then impoſed, to come unto the antichriſtian worſhip of that
high-place, where there was a high Altar erected for the late Queen, at
laſt went thither on that day which is unjuſtly called St. <hi>Lukes</hi> day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the eys of all thoſe <hi>Kentiſh</hi> and other Malignants, although to our
great damage and danger of our lives, both in tearing the Surplice to
pieces, and witneſſing to the full all their ſpirituall evils, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fear or favour, as that faithfull Prophet whom God ſent from
<hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>Bethel,</hi> did deliver his Meſſage againſt King <hi>Ieroboam's</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
in offeriug ſacrifice there, contrary to the word of God, ſo that
his ſalt did not loſe it's ſavour, but ſtill contiuued good.</p>
            <p>But in regard I affect brevity, howſoever I be oftentimes driven other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
either for conveniencie or neceſſity, and that it would be needleſſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118156:10"/>

            </opener>
            <p>YOu charge me in your Letter for being in the Pulpit, and
being ſilent there at the time, when a very great offence was
committed in the Congregation. You all along take that for
granted, which is altogether a Miſtake, namely, that I underſtood the
preſent Fact. Wherefore to remove this Miſtake, and to inform you
rightly, will be at once your Satisfaction, and my Vindication. Vpon
this account I ſhall give you a plain Narration of thoſe paſſages, which
relate to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>I was in the midſt of my Sermon, when I ſaw at one end of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
a great diſturbance among the people, with a ſudden fear. I caſt my
eye on the other end, where I ſaw in the midſt of the crowd a Woman as
I gueſt b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> her head, bare to the middle of her back, the reſt of her being
hid from my ſight in the throng: Hereupon I turned to the diſturbed
people to quiet them, by telling them, that there was no danger, that it
was a mad-woman onely that occaſioned the Stir.</p>
            <p>No other imagination upon that ſudden glance entred into my Spirit.
Before I could again turn my eye towards that place, the VVoman was
ſuddenly carryed out by Souldiers, who alwayes keep a court of Guard
cloſe by the door of the Chapell; It was when I came down out of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118156:11"/>
Pulpit, that I firſt was acquainted with the Truth of that Story, which
for the monſtrouſneſs of it ſeemed incredible to me, untill it was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by many hands.</p>
            <p>Sir, I appeal to thoſe who hear me in publick, how farre in a conſtant
courſe upon all occaſions; how far after a more particular manner in the
firſt Sermons which I preached after that enormous Scandall, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
my ſelf againſt the heynous evill of ſuch Practiſes, and thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Principles which lead to ſuch Practiſes. I doe not therefore think it
needfull for me to ſay more in a private Letter, ſeeing I ſay ſo much, ſo
frequently in Publique.</p>
            <p>I had much rather, that the good ſavour of my Name ſhould ariſe
freely from the precious Oyntment of Chriſts Love in his Providence,
of the Spirit of Chriſt in my Life, in my Doctrine; than from my own
Endeavours concerning it. Only, as a Chriſtian, I have thus far taken
this care to give to you, who are a profeſſed Brother in Christ, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
which you have deſired from me.</p>
            <p>Having therefore kindly thanked you, for that zeal to the glory of our
Lord Ieſus, for that reſpect and love to me, which you expreſſe in yours
Letter; Praiſing you for the heat of your affections, ſo farre as you are
carefull to joyn it with Light, I commend you to the grace of God, and

            </opener>
            <p>I Have received your Anſwer to my Epiſtle, whereby for mine own
part, as one honeſt man ſhould truſt another, I am ſufficiently ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
even as I was alſo of a diſcreet Military Officer, who at the ſame
juncture of time commanded the guard, when the impudent woman
before that high Aſſembly appeared; and I hope, that all the people of
theſe united Nations, who have either ſo much chriſtianity as to truſt a
Chriſtian, or wiſh in other matters to be truſted themſelves, or have
heard, or may happen to hear or read of this buſineſſe, as it is in this
ſmall volume both queſtioned and anſwered, or have been otherwiſe
informed, yea, or have ſo much moderation and diſcretion as to ſubmit
unto ſuch circumſtances as are grounded upon reaſon, cannot chuſe but
reſt likewiſe ſatisfied, even with thoſe probable cauſes or reaſons of that
ſilence, wherewith in the Epiſtle you are ſo ſtrictly charged, which are
in your anſwer ſo evidently expreſſed; yet, that no man miſtake me, I
do not profeſſe to ſpeak or write infallibly, but truſt every honeſt man,
as I would be truſted by all honeſt men: for revealed things belong to
us, but ſecret things to God, and therefore it's juſtly ſaid, That man
judgeth by outward appearance, but God judgeth righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Howſoever as King <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that rebuketh a man ſhall find
more favour afterwards, than he that flattereth with his lips, and that a
reproof entreth more into a wiſe man, than a hundred ſtripes into a fool,</hi>
Prov. 28. 23. &amp; 17. 10. ſo the truth and validity of both which para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
I have found, by that diſcretion, moderation and affection, yea and
both thankfulneſſe and commendation, which (out of your ingenuity)
you are pleaſed in your modeſt anſwer to uſe and expreſſe towards me,
though a very weak inſtrument of God, for the peoples ſatisfaction and
your good, according to the firſt words of that divine Author, <hi>Pro.</hi> 15. 1.
howbeit I charged you as a moſt negligent Chriſtian, even to the very
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118156:12"/>
utmoſt of my evidence, which from divers famous people I heard, and ſo
far as to them in ſuch a tumult appeared.</p>
            <p>And as concerning the difference of your judgement or practice from
the ſeparated Churches, mentioned in the New Teſtament, whereof I
gave you a hint both in the beginning and midſt of what I wrote, a few
words being ſufficient to the wiſe; ſo ſtill in brief, I wiſh from my heart,
ſeeing the moſt ſincere Chriſtians, do but know, practice, believe, and
prophecie only in part, that none of all our endeavours, who are but
weak in reſpect of others, may tend in the leaſt to the quenching of the
Spirit, or deſpiſing of prophecie, but to prove all things, hold faſt that
which is good, and abſtain from all appearance of evill, chiefly by exact
obedience to Gods heavenly call, even in comming quite out of <hi>Babel,</hi>
touching no unclean thing, and offering all our gifts and ſacrifices in
<hi>Sion,</hi> which is the perfection of beauty, where God hath promiſed his
own glorious preſence in the ſincere practice of all his holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>For (to ſpeak impartially, which we are bound alwayes to doe) as
thoſe who come ſhort of the mark, have very great need to ſtrive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and forget what's behind; ſo have they as great need who ſtand
very near it, alwayes to take heed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt they ſhould fall backwards from
it: ſo that I argue not for any immunity, in regard of ſtability concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
totall ſeparats, though I conceive that to be the very height of
Religion; but that all who have the title of Chriſtians, may both attain
thereunto, and perſevere therein without apoſtacy or decling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> See <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 26, &amp;c. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 21. 22. Which excellent duties if we could but
fervently deſire to perform, and earneſtly beſeech God for the gracious
aſſiſtance alwaies of his bleſſed Spirit, to ſtrengthen and lead us into
all truth; then doubtleſs, as <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for the Church of the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,
The very God of peace would ſanctifie us wholly, and preſerve our
