            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE Burrough of TRURO.</head>
            <p>THE Burrough of <hi>TRURO</hi> is an ancient Parliamentary Burrough by Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by virtue thereof only, ſent Members to the Parliaments in the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> I. <hi>Edw.</hi> II. and <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>Rich.</hi> II. and <hi>Henry</hi> VI. at which times the Returns were certified by the Sheriff in a Schedule annexed to the Writ, wherein the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Truro</hi> are ſaid to be elected <hi>pro Communitate Burgi,</hi> as is evident by the ſaid Returns.</p>
            <p>The Returns for Parliament in the Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. and <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. are loſt.</p>
            <p>In the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Returns of Members to repreſent that Burrough in Parliament, were by Indenture; wherein it appears, That the Election of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to ſerve for that Burrough, was by the whole Commonalty.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by Charter dated 31ſt year of her Reign, for the better Government of the ſaid Burrough for the future, did grant, That the Inhabitants of the ſaid Burrough, and their Succeſſors, ſhould from thenceforth be one Body-Politick, Incorporate by the Name of <hi>The Mayor and Burgeſſes of the Burrough of</hi> Truro <hi>in the County of</hi> Cornwall. And further Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, That from thenceforth for ever, Four and Twenty of the moſt diſcreet Inhabitants of the ſaid Burrough ſhould be aiding and aſſiſting to the Mayor in all Cauſes and Matters relating to the Government of the ſaid Burrough; which Twenty-four are named and appointed in the ſaid Charter by their reſpective Names, to be the firſt and modern Capital Burgeſſes, and Councellors of the ſaid Burrough.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Charter doth likewiſe grant, That the Mayor and Burgeſſes of the ſaid Burrough ſhall ſend two Burgeſſes to repreſent them in all future Parliaments, to be elected as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to be maintained and paid by the Commonalty of the ſaid Burrough.</p>
            <p>In the Reigns of King <hi>James</hi> I. and King <hi>Charles</hi> I. the Returns are made by the Mayor and Burgeſſes; by which words all the Inhabitants at large (who were Incorporated by the Name of <hi>Mayor and Burgeſſes</hi>) muſt be intended.</p>
            <p>That in the Convention, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. that Return is by the Mayor and Capital Burgeſſes; which appears to be the firſt Inſtance of their uſurping the ſole Right of Election, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the other Burgeſſes and Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>It is pretended, That in the firſt Parliament after the Reſtauration of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. it was adjudged in Parliament, That the Right of Election was in the Capital Burgeſſes only. But if any ſuch Judgment were, it was obtained by ſurprize, the Commonalty of the Burrough not having opportunity to make their Defence, and the merits of their Right not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon; the Commonalty never acquieſcing therein, but having ever ſince claimed their Privilege of Voting, and accordingly elected; which Elections were not decided, by reaſon of the Diſſolution of thoſe Parliaments.</p>
            <p>Some of the Capital Burgeſſes, and about 300 other Burgeſſes and Free-men of the ſaid Burrough, elected <hi>John Tredenham</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>John Manley</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to ſerve in this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is certified under the hands of about Eight Score of the Electors, and the hands of Mr. <hi>Thomas Trewolla</hi> (who was Mayor when the Charter was ſurrendred) and Mr. <hi>Hugh Ackland,</hi> (who was elected and ſworn Mayor the 9th of <hi>October</hi> laſt, for the preſent year) and under the Common Seal of the Burrough.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Aſhenurſt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> are returned by Mr. <hi>Sladen,</hi> (who was ſet up to be Mayor on the 5th of <hi>January</hi> laſt for that purpoſe) as elected by the Capital Burgeſſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the reſt of the Burgeſſes and Free-men, tho there were not above ſeven or eight of the old Capital Burgeſſes who voted for them.</p>
            <p>It is conceived, That by all this it appears, that the Right of Election is as well in all the Inhabitants and Burgeſſes paying Scot and Lot, as in the Capital Burgeſſes, who were firſt conſtituted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s ſaid Charter; and that Mr. <hi>Tredenham</hi> and Mr. <hi>Manley</hi> are duly elected Members to ſerve for the ſaid Burrough in this preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>To be heard before the Committee this Afternoon.</p>
