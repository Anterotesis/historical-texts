         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SO great is the impudency and madneſs of thoſe (whom fools call Judgement-giving, or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary Aſtrologers) that they will needs perſwade the vulgar and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, that the moſt holy and ſacred Scripture (as they boaſt and brag it) not onely winks at, but gives full power and authority to their Art of Aſtronomy; and therefore, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, God created the great Lights and Luminaries of the Heavens, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and ſaid to them, <hi>Let them be for ſigns, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108153:4"/>
Which words they will needs wreſt to ſpeak thus; that by Aſtrological divination, and obſerving the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Stars, they can prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate things to come, and future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents: This grand error hath cauſed St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and divers other Fathers, upon the true expoſition of thoſe words to enlarge themſelves; and upon ſound Fundamentals, not onely to impugne and diſprove, but alſo to lay open the vanities and fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries of Aſtrological Predictions. By the example of which Fathers, but more eſpecially by the heavy and ſeveral Sentences in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture againſt thoſe kinde of Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, being moved, and alſo by a juſt hatred againſt them, by reaſon of
<pb facs="tcp:108153:4"/>
their fraudulent cheating, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious lyes and couzenage, this Book is undertaken to confute and refell thoſe fantaſtick Divinations: which is hoped will be accepted by all; as being for the utility and good of all. <hi>Johannes Picus Mirandulanus</hi> hath written very largely and learnedly upon this ſubject, but his prolixity retards his Readers from peruſing his whole works; therefore in this Tract (though the field be large and ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) ſuch method ſhall be uſed, that nothing ſhall be brought upon the ſtage (yet many curious Queſtions offer themſelves) but onely ſuch as ſhall be ſuccinct, and moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the purpoſe. In this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe againſt the vanity of this ſort of
<pb facs="tcp:108153:5"/>
Aſtrologers, I will reduce all into five Chapters.</p>
            <p>In the firſt ſhall be demonſtrated, that Divination is oppoſite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Sacred and Eccleſiaſticall Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Aſtrologers are totally ignorant of Celeſtiall and Heavenly things.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That this Divining and Fore-telling Art is contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the Stars are ſo far from being the Efficient Cauſes of things to come, that they are not ſo much as evident Signs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Reaſon ſhall make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that no Predictions of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers can be infallible and true.</p>

And a little before he had ſaid, thy wiſdom and thy ſcience, this hath deceived thee; and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in his tenth Chapter admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the Jews to contemn and ſet light by Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Predictions and Obſervations, for that by no influence of ſtars any thing was either to be feared or hoped for; theſe are his words: <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the wayes of the Gentiles learn not, and the ſigns of the Heavens, which the Heathen fear, be not afraid, becauſe the laws of the people are vain.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. denieth man to have the knowledge and foreſight of things to come, or contingent; <hi>A man is ignorant what hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and what ſhall be after him who can tell, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>A man is ignorant of things paſt, and things to come he can know by no meſſenger.</hi> Thus we may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive, the vain Aſtrological Predictions in holy Writ, to be contemned, derided, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>And with the ſacred Text in this as in all things elſe, the Judgement of the holy Church walks hand in hand, for ever from the very infancy and firſt beginning, ſhe cryes out againſt, deteſts, and condemns Judicial Aſtrology, and the vain fooleries thereof, how many and ſeveral, yea, and thoſe moſt ſevere and checking Decrees, and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations hath ſhe enacted to that purpoſe againſt thoſe brain-ſick Fortune tellers and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators of future events, read in thé ſecond part of her Decrees throughout the firſt five Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and you ſhall eaſily diſcover her juſt anger againſt her perverſe (if ſo I may call them) chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; or if ſuch ſpurious may be ſtiled the iſſue of ſo holy a Mother: Read the ninth and tenth Chapter of the Council called <hi>Bracarenſe,</hi> caſt your eyes upon the <hi>Toletane</hi> Council, in the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith, againſt the Priſcillianiſts, and you ſhall finde how much that fantaſtick ſeeming Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is exploded and deteſted.

            <p>And moſt abſurd and ridiculous, or rather infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated and mad was that grand Apoſtata, <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> the Emperour, who would needs in his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, which he ſcribbled out againſt Chriſtians, prove even out of Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

               <p>THere are four reaſons why the Devils in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling future events ſo often and much miſtake.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they poſitively and peremptorily affirm things [which have their ſole dependance upon mans free will] which being both mutable and flexible unto all things as really free; doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times operate after a certain extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and again, being other while divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, we do and act things contrary to what we formerly had intended, and by our own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and imagination thought expedient? Nay, ofttimes it falls out, that what the Devil had foretold and determined to bring to paſs (Almighty God forbidding and hindering it) he cannot make it his deſired Cataſtrophe. To conclude, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Deity not unfrequently uſeth to effect things in a way, different from the common courſe and ordinary providence; and by this means the Devil is very many times deceived and miſtaken: And pray then, what rational ſoul will believe Aſtrologers infallibly to ſpeak truth, when we ſee the Devil himſelf cannot do it? what do I thus trouble my ſelf with this infernal fiend, when the moſt learned Divines and School-men affirm, that

               <p>THis diſcourſe and argumentation queſtionleſs is moſt valid and convincing, if Chriſtian Diſcipline and Religion be exact, perfect, and true as no doubt but it is; then of neceſſity muſt that vain and impertinent Aſtrological Science or Prognoſtication, be falſe and erroneous, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſeveral times taxed, cenſured, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of vanity and falſity by that Religion but if Chriſtian Faith be falſe and deceitful, which is ſpread in a manner over the ſuperficies of the whole univerſe, and hath brought almoſt all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under its ſweet yoke and obedience, and hath now flouriſhed and been reſplendent theſe 1661 years compleat; if all the actions of mortal and

humane creatures proceed from the motions of the heavens, then muſt it undeniably follow, that the great ſtudy and propenſion which men have to imbrace, maintain, and defend the Law and Faith of Chriſt, muſt have its dependency upon ſome unreſiſtible and moſt powerfull conſtellation; and therefore the heavens ſhould encline and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to evil; for if the Faith of Chriſt ſhould be falſe, queſtionleſs it would be more falſe and deteſtable then any other ſect, or opinion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; for it teacheth, informeth, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth our ſouls concerning God and Divine Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which ſhould they be falſe, would palliate and contain of neceſſity moſt damnable ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and execrable impiety: but ſeeing that that life which is ſquared, directed, and guided by the modal frame and rule of Chriſtian Faith, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all praiſe and admiration; hence it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, that from the ſelf-ſame Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation both good and bad ſhould be produced: bad in reſpect of Chriſtian Doctrine, its falſity; and good for the admirableneſs and excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that life which is directed and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the rule and dictamen in that Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Adde alſo that the greateſt proof of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith is, and the moſt perſpicuous and clear ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Divine Providence, that whatſoever hath hapned either concerning our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our or his Church, all that (I ſay) whatſoever

            <p>CRave and learned Philoſophers, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate Aſtrological Divination, to be ridiculous and grounded upon no firm and ſolid baſis or foundation, aſſert their Theſes and Concluſions after this manner: Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers cannot certainly know, the vigour, power, defluxions, or effects of the Stars; nay, had they that knowledge which they have not, yet were it not ſufficient, for a full and certain foretelling of things hereafter to be contingent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it follows by neceſſary conſequence, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that Aſtrological predictions are frivolous, vain, and fallacious. Two things are included in this argument, which are to be more at large elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidated and explained, before further progreſs herein: The firſt is, that Aſtrologers are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Celeſtial things: The other, that although they were really and undeniably moſt expert and skilful, yet were not that ſufficient, to divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108153:16"/>
of future events; we will ſpeak of the firſt in this enſuing Paragraph.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Judiciary Aſtrologers ignorant of Celeſtial things.</head>
               <p>Out of this which I ſhall now produce before your eyes, I will plainly make it manifeſt, that Judiciary Aſtrologers are ignornt of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things and cauſes; firſt therefore, it is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, hard, and laborious, to know thoſe things perfectly concerning the Heavens, which to us ſeem more obvious and facile: as for inſtance; The Nature of the Heavens, the Magnitude, the Number of the Orbs, the order within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the difference of dignity, the variety of motions; and to proceed a little further, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Stars, the compariſon of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, concerning their greatneſſe, brightneſſe, power, and effects. The grand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepance and variety of opinions of the beſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers herein, which we finde gives a moſt clear and perfect notion of this difficulty. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whom the world acknowledgeth the Prince of Philoſophers, candidly and ingenuouſly confeſſed, that concerning many Celeſtial things he had no certain or exquiſite knowledge, but onely an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary and conjectural skill, and being deſtitute of real and manifeſt reaſons, he was compelled to make uſe of probable arguments and conjectures;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108153:17"/>
peruſe and read over <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book <hi>de Coelo, Text</hi> 17. 34. 60, <hi>&amp;</hi> 61. which if it be ſo, who will give credit unto Aſtrologers, (who as all muſt grant, being as perſpicuous as the fun at noon-day) are not to be compared with thoſe great Maſters in Philoſophy) that thoſe things in the Heavens by the judgement of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers are moſt obſtruſe, and to mortals, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible; I ſay, the vertue and foretelling cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of things to come, ſhould be ſo clear, and experimentally known.</p>
               <p>Let us now a little make bold with theſe all-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vining Aſtrologers, and ſomething entrench upon their patience, that they will be pleaſed, out of their profound knowledge to enucleate and enode unto us ſome of the more eaſie queſtions and doubts concerning the Heavens: As firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Heavens be of a ſimple and uncompound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or a compounded matter and form? and then whether the matter of the Heavens be ſuch as is that of ſublunary things, or different, and divers from it? whether Heaven be animate or inanimate? whether it be moved by its own proper ſtrength, and by it ſelf, or extrinſically by an Angel? by what means the dignity and excellency of the Heavens one from another ſhall be eſtimated, judged, and made manifeſt? What the reaſon may be, why all the Orbes are not circumagitated and wheeled about by one onely motion; but that ſome are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108153:17"/>
forced by one, ſome by more, and others by fewer motions? Let theſe Grandees diſcover unto us what force and power properly belonging unto it each ſtar hath upon Mettals, Vegitables, and ſuch as have fruition of vital ſpirits and life. Put theſe Queſtions and Interrogatories unto them, or ſuch like, and we ſhall finde theſe Aſtrologers igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, weak, and altogether unskilful to return an anſwer; how then can any man with reaſon think it poſſible, or worthy belief, that men who know not ſuch things as are more obvious and triviall, ſhould give an account or judgement of things more remote and hidden from the knowledge of mortals. After this let them inſtruct and teach us the defluxions and effects which flow, and have Influence over the ſeveral and diſſipated Regions of the world, and then perchance we may believe them, when they ſooth us up with the future ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the ſtars; for who knows not that it is far more eaſie to apprehend and know things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then thoſe which are to come and future, eſpecially things ſubject to mutability, where the Contingents are various, and therefore uncertain. Let them likewiſe make manifeſt and expreſs unto us the occult properties and power which ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things have (which we rather admire then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand) in Stones, Herbs, and Animals; for theſe ſeeing they are in a manner obvious and conjunct unto us, and ſubjected almoſt to all our ſenſes,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108153:18"/>
and which by daily experiments may be found out and diſcovered, certainly muſt have a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs motion and plain diſcovery: But the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of heavenly things muſt needs be of a far greater difficulty and labour, Heaven being ſo far remote and diſtant from us, and onely diſcoverable by the ſole ſenſe of the eye, which ofttimes is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and brought into errour through the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginquity of Intervals, or the violent and ſwift whirling about of the Heavens, the depraved and indiſpoſed affection of the medium, or of the ſight; the fault and imperfection of the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labe, Tables, or other Aſtronomical Inſtruments; and this we finde atteſted in the ſacred Scripture, Wiſdom, Chap. 9. <hi>For the body that is corrupted burtheneth the ſoul, and the earthly habitation preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth down the underſtanding that thinketh many things; and we do hardly conjecture the things that are in the earth; and the things that are in ſight we finde with labour; but the things that are in the Heavens who ſhall ſearch out, and thy ſenſe who ſhall know, unleſs thou give wiſdom, and ſend thine holy Spirit from on high?</hi> This ſufficiently confutes Aſtrologers, who pretend to diſcover all humane events, of which moſt have their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency upon the moſt inſcrutible will and councel of the moſt High and Mighty God.</p>

               <head>Againſt the fictitious Antiquity which theſe men vainly boaſt to have concerning obſervations.</head>
               <p>ABove all, our Aſtrologers boaſt and brag, that they have obſervations atteſted and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their events of I know not how many, yea innumerable years, beyond the limits of compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation almoſt, out of which their art hath its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, original, and perfection; for ſeeing that in the revolution of time elapſed, divers things have been produced and come to paſs, the ſame ſigns preceding, by the due minding and obſervation whereof, their Art was conflate and compleated, and therefore they endeavour to perſwade us, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> through their diligent Aſtrological obſervations, during the ſpace of four hundred and ſeventy thouſand years, have brought forth this admirable birth, I mean the profound Art of Divination, to its full maturity and perfection: But how childiſh, fictitious, and improbable this is, is thus eaſily diſcovered. Aſtrologers (let them brag what they pleaſe) could not ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times collect and gather, no not twice or thrice, thoſe obſervations and experiments; for the face and aſpect of the Heavens, and the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Celeſtial Signs, which was once, ſhall ſcarcely or never, or at leaſt not till immenſe revolutions of years, return and be the ſame: For
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108153:19"/>
the eighth Orbe, in which the wandering Stars have their being, compleats and finiſheth not its courſe before the expiration of thirty and ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years; and the moſt learned Mathematicians demonſtrate by convincing arguments, that the motions of the Heavens are incommenſurable; and therefore the ſame Aſpect of the Heavens, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Stars cannot frequently happen.</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Phavorinus</hi> in his fourteenth Book, <hi>Apud Gellium,</hi> and firſt Chapter, confirms this reaſon with admirable perſpicuity, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and clearneſs: <hi>If</hi> (ſaith this learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour) <hi>the Chaldeans obſervations were grounded after this manner, to wit, to make a ſtrict obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under what habit, form, and poſture of Stars a childe ſhould be born, and then from his non-age and very cradle, even to the Cataſtrophe and laſt period of his life, to regiſter and record his fortunes, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, qualities, and inclinations, together with the circumſtances of his affairs and tranſactions, and then (as they ſuppoſe the manner was) put all thoſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections upon a File, and enrol them upon Record; and afterwards when the ſame Stars ſhould meet in the ſame manner, and have the ſame poſition, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs they muſt needs tell the ſame fortune to any one born under ſuch a conſtellation. If this was the way, and out of this principle they grounded the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that Diſcipline, it is altogether weak and ſlippery; for let them tell me in how many years, nay</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:108153:19"/>
                  <hi>ages, this Orbe or Circle of Obſervation may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; there is no Aſtrologer but muſt know, that thoſe Stars which are called erratical, or wandering, and the fatal efficients of all thoſe things, do not, unleſs in an innumerable and almoſt infinite number of years, return to the ſame poſture, and with the ſame habit from whence they wheeled and wandered; ſo that, no order or tenor of obſervation, no memory whatſoever, no nor the very character of ſuch Letters and Monuments could be preſerved or endure ſo long a time:</hi> Thus <hi>Phavorinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if it ſhould be granted that Aſtrologers ſhould dive into the ſecret force and defluxion of every Star ſeperately, and alone by it ſelf; what force and power Stars have when they meet, and conjoyn, and are mingled, either in the Heaven, Air, Earth, in ſublunary things or their actions; this is not to be diſcovered. Reader obſerve what <hi>Origen</hi> writes upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> cited by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of his ſixth Book of <hi>Evang. Prep. Such things as they affirm (Aſtrologers) to come to paſs by the commixture, compoſition, and temperature of ſeveral Aſpects, this very thing ſhews their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for who can tell the harm pretended by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign Aſpect, the Conſtellation of the benign and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious concurring; and whether the malign detards that which the benign beſtows, becauſe it points at the others location; and whether it change or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or what commixture is made, what man can</hi>

               <p>Again there are many Stars, which are either not clearly or not at all to be ſeen; and if thoſe Aſtrologers confeſs there are many not known to them, and more not perfectly diſcovered; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then preſume they ſo confidently to predict events to enſue out of thoſe few Stars, whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they know, ſince through the influxions of the other Stars, which they know not, the effects may be either hindred or become various: unleſs they will impudently and abſurdly ſay, that the Stars which they know not have no power or influence at all: It is manifeſt amongſt the Aſtrologers themſelves, that in the eighth Heaven there are 1022 Stars, of which each exceeds the earth in bigneſs, and therefore muſt needs have great force
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108153:20"/>
and power; but of all theſe, Aſtrologers have little or no knowledge for that their prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting skill conſiſts chiefly in the obſervation of the Planets; in which they altogether trifle away their time and ſpend their dayes. <hi>Seneca,</hi> a man of a perſpicacious judgement well perceived this, when in his ſecond Book of <hi>Natur.

               <head>Of the ſtrange Star which ſome years paſt appeared.</head>
               <p>CErtain years paſt we beheld a new and ſtrange Star, never before that time conſpicious in the Heavens; which Aſtrologers affirm had its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the ſame place where the fixed Stars have their being. This Star (whereas for a time it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared viſible to our view) on a ſudden diſappeared totally and vaniſhed from our ſight; this was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108153:21"/>
generated in the Heavens, and afterwards corrupted (and 'tis like the ſame may happen to other through long intervals of time) or elſe it had its being above the Planets and wandering Stars, which have their proper paſſages although unknown to us; or above in concluſion in the eighth Heaven, which we eſteem wandering and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, which alſo hath its proper motions and operations; of which <hi>Hypparchus</hi> famous for his knowledge in Aſtrology ſeems to doubt, as <hi>Pliny</hi> in the 27. Chap. Book 2. teſtifieth: <hi>Hypparchus,</hi> ſaith he, a man never ſufficiently praiſed, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in his time that a ſtrange Star was produced, by the motion whereof, upon the day of its appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he made a great doubt whether this might be uſual, or whether thoſe Stars which we deem fixed, were moveable: Great Aſtrologers think it much to concern their Art, to underſtand cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the concordance and diſcrepancy betwixt the two Zodiacs, the one of the eighth, the other of the ninth Heaven; which nevertheleſs they ſhall never finde out, for that the ninth Heaven hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Star nor light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither can any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it be diſcovered, except motion, and that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the motion of the eighth Heaven: And certain it is, that Aſtrologers can give no account of what condition theſe two Zodiacs were at the creation of the world; becauſe a certain and exact account of the time of the worlds creation,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108153:21"/>
to this day cannot be acquired; ſome account and number of years ſince that time may be had and aimed at, but of dayes and hours very difficile, if not impoſſible; and yet notwithſtanding ſuch a computation is very neceſſary and requiſite to the doctrine of Aſtrology.</p>

               <head>What a difficult thing it is punctually to obſerve what force the Aſpects of the Stars have in every mans Nativity.</head>
               <p>THe poſition of the Stars in the very moment in which one is born, without a manner of errour or miſtake can ſcarcely be attained unto: It is a matter of difficulty to diſcover the very point of time in which any one is born, and rightly to obſerve the Aſpect of the Sars which then reign and have influence in that very moment, or as I may ſay Attome, for ofttimes vapours and clouds being interpoſed, do either quite take away, obfuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or ſhut from us the ſight and aſpect both of Heaven and Stars: and above all, the moſt rapid and ſwift wheeling of the Heavens brings it ſo about, that it is fleeted and flown away before we can take perfect cognizance thereof; for in almoſt every moment the face of the Heavens, and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe poſture of the Stars is exiſtant. Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers confidently profeſs that they will exactly tell you the fortunes and events of any man, ſo that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108153:22"/>
he may but know the certain time of his birth; but ſuch an exact, ſubtil, and punctual knowledge (as is neceſſary for an Aſtrologer) is very hard to be come by; let us ſuppoſe for example, that <hi>Oliver</hi> was born the 56 year from this time, the 7 of <hi>September,</hi> at ten of the clock, either at the beginning, middle, or end thereof: but that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or almoſt nothing, or little ſomething of time, wherein <hi>Oliver</hi> fell from his Mothers womb, and came into this world, neither the Midwife, Parents, or Aſſiſtants can directly and exactly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you of, as it is neceſſarily requiſite for the Aſtrologer if he intend to divine aright.</p>
               <p>I cannot by any means in this place paſs away without ſetting down the words of Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> who treated of this ſubject accurately and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which I onely have glanced at by the way, and ſlightly touched: his words are theſe, which he left written in an Homily upon a part of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> The inventors of calculating Nativities, perceiving that in a long interval of time many Figures and Aſpects ſlipt by and eſcaped the reach of their Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, contracted their meaſures intoa very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious and ſtrait limit of time, and as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls it, a moment of time, or twinkling of an eye; and in this very moment of time, there is very great difference and deſparity betwixt nativity and nativity; for he that is even now born, ſhall be inveſted with regal dignity, wear the Diadem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108153:22"/>
of an Empire, give Laws to ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and abound in all worldly proſperity; when he that comes into the world, even imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after, ſhall be poor, deſpicable, a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond, Jugler, Hocus Pocus, and it may be, beg his bread from door to door: that Orb therefore which is called the Signifer, being divided into twelve parts when the Sun in the ſpace of thirty dayes hath paſt the twelfth part thereof, which is ſtiled by Aſtrologers, <hi>inerrans,</hi> or wandering; every of theſe twelve parts they divided into thirty par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and then thoſe parcels, each being divided into ſixty minutes; theſe minutes again they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided after the ſame manner into ſixty more. The birth therefore of one newly come into the world being determined, let us obſerve whether theſe skilful maſters with all their Art, can keep this ſo exact diviſion of time. The woman is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of her burthen, the Midwife looks whether it be male or female, next ſhe hearkens to hear it cry, as a preſage of the life and ſtrength of the childe; after ſhe brings the infant to the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and when ſhe prattles with him as goſſips uſe to do, during all theſe petty tranſactions ſince the little one was an inhabitant of this world, how many minutes as we may conjecture have paſt away; eſpecially if the Artiſt were not in the Chamber, but in ſome other remote place expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the news? Again, whilſt he is accommodating
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108153:23"/>
his Inſtruments of Art, to inveſtigate the exact and preciſe time, whether nocturnal or diurnal, how many minutes fly away: and here again when the Star is diſcovered which denotes the time and minute, then comes the twelve parts, the thirty parcels, into which each of thoſe is to be divided; then the ſubdiviſion of thoſe parcels into ſixty mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes to be examined and canvaſed over; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they can never attain to ſo preciſe and punctual a finding out of the exact time, yet they affirm this muſt neceſſarily be done in the wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unfixed Stars to know what diſpoſition and habitude they have with thoſe which are fixed, and what like figure is amongſt them, when the infant was born; things ſtanding in this ſort, that by reaſon of the variation of that moſt ſhort time a certain knowledge without errour is impoſſible to be had, not by the vain and fooliſh ſtudents of this Art, who gape after a thing impoſſible to be attainded; but alſo thus ſilly creatures who run after them as Prophets, and Wiſe men, deſerve the fools coat, cap, bauble and all.</p>

Again, humane will is the very immedate cauſe of humane actions, in reſpect of future events, which are to be produced from thence, which is of it ſelf indifferent and indeterminate, for we ſhall do things which we have not thought or deliberated; how then can an indifferent, and indeterminate cauſe produce a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a future effect; and this may be thus confirmed: The exterior actions of man depend upon the interior, that is to ſay, either by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, or choice and election; and therefore the exterior future action of man cannot be foretold, unleſs the election of his future will be known from whence it muſt neceſſarily proceed; but the future election of man cannot be known to any other; for if the reſolves and deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the minde and underſtanding which man hath in preſent cannot be diſcovered by another, how can thoſe purpoſes, deliberations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of mans underſtanding be manifeſted and made known by another, which are to happen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the revolution of many years?</p>

ſervation, to have happened when ſome notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſtellation appeared in the Heavens: But to confute this, examine his Computation of Time which he makes the Baſis whereon to ground his Argument and aſſertion; and if upon examination you finde that moſt falſe and untrue, then needs muſt the Doctrine which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propt with ſo weak a foundation be erroneous &amp; fallible. But from the worlds firſt fabricating, and <hi>Adams</hi> Creation, and <hi>Noahs</hi> Floud, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded not above 1656. as is manifeſt by Holy Scripture, being fewer years in number then his computation by 600. and the Conſtellation which they imagine to have been in the origin of the world, muſt needs precede its Creation 600. years; and the number of years between the Flood and the coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> did not fully compleat 2400. years, and therefore that conjunction of ſtars could not appear till 684. years after the Floud.

There firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would make us believe that the Stars have all the ſame proprieties and qualities of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they are partly cold, and partly humid and dry; if not formally, at leaſt virtually, that is not in act but in effect; if not by having the qualities themſelves, yet by having the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent faculties of thoſe qualities: <hi>Saturn</hi> by their opinion is too frigid, the Moon humid, <hi>Mars</hi> dry: But this both reaſon and experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes. Reaſon thus; if all the ſtars be lucid and caſt forth light, they muſt be all hot, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce heat; let us grant their Adage, that the Moon and the reſt of the Stars ſhine by a light borrowed from the Sun; if then the reaſon and origin of the light and brightneſs of all the ſtars be one and the ſame, how then can the reaſon
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108153:43"/>
of acting and operating by them be ſo diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant, unlike, and different: Experience gives this a check, for when it is full Moon, and that Planet moſt reſplendent, and repleniſhed with light and luſtre, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and experience tells us, that the nights are warmer then either before or after. Our Star-gazers beſides this luminoſity or light, have diſcovered in the Heavens and Stars ſtrange power and vertue, differing both from the light, and jarring among themſelves, yet cauſes of ſtrange and wonderous effects; and theſe to the great credit of the buſineſs they ſtile <hi>Influences;</hi> an invention ſo modern and modiſh, that the Ancient and learned Philoſophers were never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with any ſuch nomenclation; nay, the Aſtrologers as much as may be gathered out of their writings, in ancient time were altogether unacquainted with theſe niceties: But this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-influences begotten by Fortune-tellers of a later brood, nurſt by their Abettors, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their followers, have at all times been hiſt out of the Schools and Academies of Learning, as ſpurious and abortive; and one amongſt the more accurate ſort of Philoſophers calls them, the Sanctuary and refuge of ignorance, and fools Paradice. And to theſe prodigious Influences the baffled Aſtrologer betakes himſelf as to his laſt lurking hole, being an Ambuſcado to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap Simpletons, and caſt a miſt before their eyes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108153:43"/>
who are not grounded in the true principles of Philoſophy; and this they do when, and as oft as they cannot ſhew the proper and natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the wonderous effects of thoſe things call'd Influences; which if they be admitted, farewell all Philoſophy, her glory is eclipſt, authority anihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and her high eſteem quite aboliſhed. What need great Wits and eminent Philoſophers puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle and trouble themſelves to finde out and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the occult and hidden cauſes of things, if in a trice, and as it were twinkling of an eye, by means of the Omnipotent Influences, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe and hidden ſecrets of nature may ſo eaſily be attained unto; ask by what undiſcovered power the Load-ſtone attracts Iron, you ſhall not ſtay long for an anſwer; for you ſhall quickly hear an Oracle tell you, that its proper Celeſtiall Influence hath inveſted it with that vertue; from whence hath the little Fiſh call'd <hi>Remora</hi> ſuch ſingular power, as for to retard and ſtop a ſhip under ſail in her full career and height of ſpeed? Oh the proper Celeſtial influence of that poor and ſilly fiſh hath given it that power. What needs more to be ſaid, no probleme, nothing ſo reſerv'd by nature from mans knowledge; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo full of the difficulty which Philoſophers have laboured to diſcover, but theſe ignorant Pedants, and vagabond Gipſies will quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and enode, by telling you of the Celeſtiall Influences.</p>

But to come a little cloſer to theſe youngſters, if <hi>Saturn,</hi> becauſe he is lucid, by his light produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth heat, how can the ſame by his Influence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce cold; is it not abſurd that in the ſame ſtar, there ſhould be two contrary faculties, the one of producing heat, the other cold; not onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, but oppoſite and contrary? We ſee that nature hath ſo provided that in all things, where there are two differencies and proprieties, (as Philoſophers ſay) the one general, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to one thing with many others: The other ſpecial, which is proper to a thing, (as in man to be knowing and rational) ſo that the ſpecificall and proper difference and propriety is more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and perfect then the general, as being that which doth contract and determine it, giving it a reaſon and degree of new perfection; as in the example of man, it is more noble to be rational, then to be knowing: but this happens quite contrary in this ſtrange Doctrine of the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers; for they teach (for inſtance ſake) that in <hi>Saturn</hi> there are two proprieties or faculties of operating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one general and common to him with the reſt of the ſtars, which is a power of Illuminating, and by that Illumination to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce heat; another ſpecial and proper to <hi>Saturn,</hi> in reſpect of which he differs from other ſtarres; which is a faculty of producing cold, or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain vertue of ſome other Influence: but it is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108153:44"/>
moſt evident, that the Celeſtial Light is far more noble then any other Celeſtial Quality; and the faculty of producing heat far excells that of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing cold: furthermore in every thing there are two faculties or proprieties naturall to that thing; the one univerſal, the other particular, in themſelves contrary; as in <hi>Saturn</hi> the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heat by light, cold by influence: But rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and nature it ſelf ſaith this cannot be done: For as in a multiform body, which the Greeks call Hetrogeneal, according to the ſeverall parts there may be ſeveral qualities and faculties, as it happens in the body of man in the head and heart; but it cannot happen in the ſtar of <hi>Saturn,</hi> being for as much as concerns its parts of the ſame form and nature; the one part thereof is not beautified with light, the other with influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but as the whole is repleniſhed with light, ſo alſo ſhould it be with influence. It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to make any other diſpute againſt Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers concerning Influences, for this one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſufficient to take away the influence of all things which are produced in nature, ſeem they never ſo ſingular and wonderful, The true, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and natural cauſes of all things have their dependency from two Celeſtial Principles, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Light;</hi> which is moſt manifeſt by daily experience, and all things moſt probably to be produced from them. Aſtrologers imagine and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108153:45"/>
dream, that the figures and poſition of the ſtars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the ſigns in the Zodizck, reſembling the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of men or animals, to have a great power and vertue in each mans nativity; when by themſelves, and their own nature, they are no ſuch thing, but have onely their exiſtence and being in the Aſtrologers noddle, which repreſents ſuch and ſuch; for they may as well reſemble them to Creatures, Houſes, Caſtles, Towers, Tables, or the like; and therefore it is ridiculous to think, that in ſuch like figures there is any thing of conſequence to divine or foretell future events.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond Fundemental of Aſtrologers is, that the birth-ſtars of every man are to be obſerved, for that from them all caſualties and events of his life may be foreſeen and progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticated; but who ſees not this principle to be weak and infirm?

not how many, even almoſt innumerable ages; and that the quinteſſence and marrow of that divine Art had its origin from the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> the very firſt and ancient poſſeſſors of this Univerſe; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf in his book concerning the Heavens, and in another, wherein he treats of Meteors, affirms, <hi>that the Egyptians are the moſt ancient Planters in the terreſtrial Globe;</hi> and in the beginning of his Metaphyſicks he ſaith, <hi>The Egyptians the moſt ancient amongſt mortals firſt invented and digeſted the Mathematicall Art and Science.</hi> And the former and ancient Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers were wont to boaſt, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> ſucceſſively employed their time and endeavours for the ſpace of 470. thouſand years, in calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Nativities, and carefully keeping and reſerving the experimentals and obſervations of the children in that ſo long a time born: But this is ſo manifeſt an untruth, a lye ſo palpable, that it may almoſt be felt, and therefore not worth mentioning or confutation; for ſince the very firſt Creation of the world there have elapſed not much more then 6000. years, and from the firſt originall of that Nation of the the <hi>Chaldeans, viz.</hi> from the confuſion of tongues at the ſubverſion of <hi>Babels</hi> Tower, not more then 4000. years. <hi>Picus Mirand.</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of his ſecond Book againſt

Plotinus</hi> a Coetanean and School-fellow of <hi>Origen,</hi> was of the ſame opinion, and aſſerts it in a Book which he entitles, <hi>Whether or no the Stars have any power;</hi> and in another book concerning <hi>Fate</hi> in the ſixth chapter he ſaith, that this is the uſe and benefit of the ſtars, that whoſoever beholds them and contemplates as books and letters, and is skilful in this kind of literature, ſhall know future things from thoſe figures, if with a kind of anolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall compariſon he diligently ſearch out their myſteries and ſignification: and <hi>Porphirius</hi> affirms, that being fully bent to kill and make away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was diverted from that wicked reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the means of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> who fore-ſaw the danger by the vertue of the ſtars.</p>

and plauſible, he bringeth ſome ſentences out of holy Writ to trim and deck it up withall; for, ſaith he to grace the matter, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chap. 34. not obſcurely tells us, <hi>And the heavens ſhall be folded together like a book;</hi> by which it is meant, that after the day of judgement, the heavens like a book ſhall be claſpt, and faſt ſhut up, which now are laid open, and expoſed for us to read and meditate; and to the ſame effect and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 21. <hi>The Heavens ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his juſtice;</hi> and in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18. <hi>The Heavens ſhew forth the glory of God;</hi> and in the firſt book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſpeaking of the ſtars, <hi>And they ſhall be for ſigns;</hi> and in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 88. <hi>The Heavens ſhall confeſſe thy marvellous works, O Lord.</hi> Neither, quoth <hi>Origin,</hi> doth this opinion take away free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in man, no more then formerly did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of the ancient Prophets, or the preſcience of all future things, which is in Almighty God, and reſteth in his divine boſome. <hi>Plotinus</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionates, that this power and skill to predict fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things by vertue of the ſtars is given to man either by the ſingular favour of Almighty God, or through the excellent knowledge in Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; for the obtaining whereof we uſe all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diligence and acurate ſtudy.</p>

               <p>THat the ſtars are ſigns of future events, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not onely contradictory to ſolid Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, but alſo oppoſite and repugnant to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; and although the reaſons which I have alledged in the premiſes be ſufficient to convince this infirm doctrine; yet in this place I
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108153:52"/>
will produce other forcible arguments to corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate what formerly I have maintained: Firſt therefore whatſoever is a natural ſign of another thing, that upon neceſſity muſt be either its cauſe or effect, or both, and proceed from the ſuperior and common cauſe; for beſides theſe, what fourth member can be imagined, to have the ſign upon neceſſity joyned with the cauſe by it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; this is no way diſtinct from the third Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for ſuch a connexion and conjunction can no other wayes have a being, then that the cauſe ſhould produce that out of it ſelf, which is the Sign; and then that which is the thing ſignified, as the ſame thing which moves the cauſe to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and excites it, muſt alſo applicate and apply that which is preſignified; but each of theſe muſt neceſſarily be referred to the common cauſe, from whence this argument may be framed: If the Heavens and Stars be ſigns of all ſublunary things, they are either their cauſes (which this opinion allows not) or the effects, which no man in his wits will grant, or preſume to affirm; or elſe (which is all that can be ſaid) as well celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as ſublunary things proceed from the common cauſe; as the Rain-bow is ſign of fair weather, not that it is the cauſe or effect thereof, but one and the ſame is the common cauſe of both; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſſity the common cauſe of celeſtiall and ſublunary bodies muſt either be corporeal or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108153:52"/>
I do not think they will ſay it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, for above the Heavens there is no body at all; therefore they muſt grant, that all things muſt be referred to an incorporeal cauſe; that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God himſelf or Angels, who moves the Heavens: ſo that whilſt Angels move the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, in the very ſtate, habit, poſition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of thoſe Heavens, as it were by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nods and becks of theirs like notes and ſigns deſcribed therein, they ſhould point out and predict the events and contingents of humane affairs; but this in many reſpects is not credible, for whoſoever grounds upon this foundation, muſt needs grant and ſay, that Angels induce mortals unto all, and whatſoever, even the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt horrid fins and villanies.</p>
               <p>In this point Philoſophy doth inform us, and alſo Theology doth the like, that there is no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Angels, (as they call it) <hi>tranſeant,</hi> which immediately proceeds from them, other then lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal motion; and that the Angels who do circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve and wheel about the Celeſtial Orbes, theſe I ſay, thoſe great maſters averre to have no other operation concerning humane affairs, then what proceeds from motion and the light of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: For thoſe I know not what inſluences di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from light, I have formerly ſufficiently made null; and there is no man ſo brain-ſick, who will affirm, if he will ſpeak things probable
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108153:53"/>
and likely, that motion and the light of heaven can infallibly, clearly, and diſtinctly premon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate all future effects of ſublunary things; and again, when two effects of the ſame cauſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſhew one the other, as they muſt proceed from the ſame cauſe, ſo muſt they alſo proceed after one and the ſame manner, otherwiſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that they ſhould indicate one another: Such things as are brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In like manner other arguments may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; if the ſtars who are confined to a ſet and certain number, and of a like condition, can be ſigns of future things, which are almoſt infinite both in number and variety, and in themſelves diſcrepant and differing: How can the ſame poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conformity of ſtars, under which Twins and many others are born in in the ſame moment of time, be a certain ſign properly and diſtinctly to preſignifie ſo many ſeveral and diſtinct diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, caſualties, and events, as we daily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in them? therefore if we grant the ſtars to be ſigns of future things, we muſt alſo affirm them to be their cauſes; and if we deny them to be Cauſes, we muſt alſo deny them to be Signs.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108153:54"/>
ſay, that the ſtars are the future effects of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſes: If this be ſo, it muſt needs follow that there will be no cauſes left remaining to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede, obſtruct, or hinder whatſoever is by the ſtars predicted, and it will neceſſarily come to paſs, that whatſoever is ſublunary muſt be tied to an abſolute fate and neceſſity which the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this opinion will not allow of, or ſhould they, it were moſt wicked and impious.</p>
               <p>As concerning that Text of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 54. <hi>The Heavens like a book ſhall be folded up;</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the places of Scripture formerly ſet down ſeems to have the moſt of difficulty in it, I finde it diverſly, and by divers and ſeverall Expoſitors gloſſed and interpreted; yet no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, if it be of an approved Authour, or at leaſt probable, which makes for, or ſides with that opinion. <hi>Juſtinus Martyr</hi> anſwering to the forty ninth interrogatory of the Orthodoxes, wherein the Querie was, how that place of <hi>Iſaias</hi> was to be underſtood, when he ſaith; <hi>That the Heavens like a book ſhall be folded up: ſaith, as the divine word ſometimes by a ſimilitude compares hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a skin extended, ſaying, who extends the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven like a skin; other times to ſmoak, other times to a chamber: and ſo on the contrary, ſpeaking of the diſſolution of the heavens, it is compared to a book and other things, and by</hi> David <hi>in his Pſalms to a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment waxing old.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> upon the ſame

In the Scripture the Heavens are ſaid to ſhew the juſtice of God, to reveal his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to prove and give teſtimony of mans wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Nicholas de Lyra</hi> expound theſe words after another manner; the Heavens, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, like a book ſhall be ſhut up, that is, henceforth Ethnicks ſhall make no uſe of their Aſtronomancy, nor dare to foretell the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events of mankinde, as if they were able to read from the ſtars future fortunes and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. Others interpret theſe words thus, there ſhall be no further entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, from henceforth the gates thereof ſhall be ſhut up: Others expound theſe words in this ſenſe; the help, uſe, and miniſtery of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Stars, which is beſtowed upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde before the day of judgement, after ſhall ceaſe, and have no more being; for although the Heavens ſhall not utterly periſh and be anihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet thoſe good offices and favours which now they perform on the behalf of mortals and their ſakes, ſhall after that day of dread and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ceaſe, and ſhall have a long vacation, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108153:55"/>
by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is excellently expreſt in the ſimilitude of a book, which when we have made what uſe we can of it, and fully perus'd it, we claſp and ſhut it up, and lay it aſide.</p>
               <p>Another interpretation of this place is not to be rejected; ſome are of opinion, that in that terrible day by this ſimilitude is meant the high indignation wrath and juſt anger of the ſupream Judge againſt thoſe Nations of whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh: ſuch a hurly-burly, confuſion and conſternation; ſuch horrour, fear, and trembling amongſt the reprobate; ſuch remorſe, grief, and anguiſh of minde, that through the very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency thereof, the very celeſtial luminaries will ſeem as it were to be extinguiſhed, the ſtarres to drop from the firmament, the motions of the Orbs to be in rebellion, and heaven it ſelf to be wrapped up and foulded, and vaniſh away: and what is here ſaid by the Prophet to be foulded up, by St. <hi>John</hi> in the Apocalyps, is ſaid to recede and depart away.</p>
               <p>But to make this more plain, if ſuch as are not acquainted with Antiquities ſtartle at this word folded up, ſpeaking of the book, in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, they muſt know that the Pebrews (as alſo the Romans and all civiliz'd people) had not their books bound up in <hi>Folio, Quarto,</hi> or <hi>Octavo,</hi> as the now mode and form is, but in a different manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they had skins of velome or parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108153:56"/>
or elſe the thin rindes of trees, tatched and fixed together (of one and the ſame breadth) in length, and being faſtned at the one end to a Cylineer, or round piece of wood they reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled much our Pedegrees which are drawn by Heralds, or a web of cloth wrapt about a weavers beam, ſo that when they had a minde to peruſe any parcel or paſſage, they did fold and unfold as occaſion required; and this the Prophet uſed as a ſimilitude: for as the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes encircle the round piece of wood, ſo do the Heavens environ and compaſs the Terreſtrial Globe one above another, and wheeling round about it, as it were their Axle-tree. Thus have you heard many expoſitions of this ſeeming hard place of <hi>Eſaias,</hi> and I am confident your own judgements will tell you, that not any one of them favours theſe grave maſters of Aſtrology, Southſayers, Fortune-tellers, Star-gazers, Quacks, or what you will call them.</p>

            <p>Although it be moſt certain &amp; uncontroulably true, that Aſtrologicall predictions are moſt falſe, as we have already ſufficiently demonſtrated; but becauſe in former ages, yea and in our preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all-knowing times it is almoſt believed, and that by grave and learned perſons, as a granted funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, that in a manner all predictions of skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſtrologers have proved true, and atteſted by their events and iſſue thereof, and that very few or none have fallen out contrary to what they have divined. Well, let us alſo follow this torrent, leſt we ſhould be thought to ſwimme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtream, and ſeem to be <hi>Joannes è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trario,</hi>

in oppoſing that which by publick ſaith and authority is cryed up and embraced, the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe predictions being granted, let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and look into the cauſes thereof; <hi>viz.</hi> by what means Aſtrologers can infallibly fore-tell future things, which ſeeing of themſelves they are uncertain, they fall not within the power and notion of humane intellect; I will avoid prolixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore do peremptorily affirm, that if any predictions of Aſtrologers have proved true, that truth proceeded not from the verity and fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of that art of Aſtronomancy, but from other cauſes; and what theſe cauſes be I will tell you ſuccinctly.</p>

Of this we have an excellent and convincing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which happened in a Romane Army (as <hi>(Lucius</hi> writes) being ready to fight the enemy: The Commanders and Southſaying Prieſts (as the then cuſtom was) beheld the Intrails of a ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Victim, thereby to conjecture of the future event of the battle; but alas they found all the Omens inauſpicious, prefiguring nothing but ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and deſtruction; yet wiſely conſulting among themſelves, they laid a fair varniſh on a rotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and by an officious or rather neceſſary and profitable Lye, made the Army believe that the Omens pretended Laurells, Victories, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs: The ſouldiers by this encouraging prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication (though onely a time-ſervice Lye) heartned and animated with courage and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted bravery, joyn battle, and boldly engage the enemy, put to flight and rout thoſe Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, Files, and Troops, which the Augurs and Diviners through their ſuperſtitious obſervations

Contrarily <hi>Miſias,</hi> High Admirall of a great Armado of the Athenians, beholding a ſudden Eclipſe of the Moon, vainly imagined with himſelf, that if he weighed anchor that night, and ſet ſail, ſome diſaſter or ſtorm would ſcatter and confound his Navy; through fooliſh fear he ſtayes ſtill in his ſuppoſed ſafe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but before morning, to chaſtiſe his folly, he together with his whole Fleet is ſurprized by the Syracuſans.
