            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

could have written ſooner, but
ſtayed till I could have an exact
Relation, which I now doe from men of honour,
and preſent in the action. The King being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the Earle of Eſſex marching to Worceſter,
and knowing that towne not tenible againſt any
conſiderable Forces, and deſirous to put the beſt
part of his Armie into one entire Body, ſent to Sir
<hi>Iohn Biron</hi> to quit the place, and joyne with Prince
<hi>Robert,</hi> then at <hi>Bridgenorth.</hi> Prince <hi>Robert</hi> deſirous
to fetch off ſo gallant a man as Sir <hi>Iohn Biron,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
through Worceſter with his Troops, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of 700. accompanied onely with Sir <hi>Iohn Biron</hi>
his Troops remaining behind in Worceſter. When
they were out of the Towne, Prince <hi>Robert</hi> being
informed that the E. of Eſſex Troops of Horſe and
<pb facs="tcp:59168:3"/>
Dragooners were at hand, marched towards them,
ſaying, We are now ingaged for the honour of
God and your Countrey, fight valiantly: and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
gave them a furious charge, which was
ſtoutly anſwered by the Parliament Forces. This
courage of theirs endured not long, for at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
charge they as fiercely ran away, in purſuit
were taken priſoners, ſlain, and drowned, above
400. divers of which betook themſelves to the
mercy of a River, wherein periſhed foure ſcore,
whereof the Lord <hi>Sayes</hi> ſon is ſaid to be one, but
that is yet uncertain, but for certain both of them
accompanied with Captain <hi>Browne</hi> a Scotchman,
at the firſt encounter ran away, leaving thoſe men

ſent a Divine to Captain <hi>Sands,</hi> who told him the
Prince was troubled ſo gallant a man ſhould periſh
in ſo unworthy an action, he gave the Prince thanks
and ſaid, death did not ſo much trouble him as
that he had endeavoured to defend ſo bad a cauſe,
which he was drawne into as well by his own am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
as by perſwaſion of other men, he was not
able to deny (he further ſaid) the flower of their

<pb facs="tcp:59168:3"/>
of rebellion, which troubled him the more, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
dilucively perſwaded others thereunto by
telling them that they fought againſt thoſe that
advanced the rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and were now in
the action, Col: <hi>Sands</hi> was encountered by Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<hi>Wilmot,</hi> but received his deaths wound by a
Frenchman, he asked how Comiſary <hi>Wilmot</hi> did,
ſeeing him wounded, being told his hurt was not
dangerous, ſaid, he was glad he had not his blood
to anſwer for: <hi>Douglas</hi> likewiſe died not ſuddainly,
he was likewiſe ſenſible of his offence. I ſpake
with a Gentleman that brought him out of the
field, to whom he confeſſed this was the third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
he had been in againſt the King, all which
from his heart he hated, but was drawn unto them
for gain and ſiniſter ends, and being taken priſoner
in the North he was diſcharged, &amp; twenty pounds
given him by the King: he was deſirous to live,
that he might diſcover to the King ſomething that
might in part expiate his former offences, which
was prevented by his death. I have been the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the relation of theſe two Gentlemens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
before their deaths, to make you ſenſible
that the hearts of theſe men goe not along with
their actions, (their blouds will lie heavy upon
thoſe <hi>boutefeux</hi> that have engaged them &amp; others,
and ſo many men to their ruine and deſtruction.)</p>
            <p>There were taken in the Skirmiſh 50. or 60. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
but none of note, and quality, but Captaine
<hi>Wingate,</hi> (a Parliament man) who is brought to

I dare not tell you they loſt more Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,

of my Letter may gaine the leſſe beleife: But I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, it is confidently reported that there were
ſlaine on our part not aboue three or foure; thoſe
Priſoners that were taken except Captaine <hi>Wingate</hi>
are diſcharged, taking an <hi>Oath</hi> not to beare Armes
againſt the King,; moſt of them were men of
meane quality, and ſo raw Souldiers that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
not the word Quarter, but cryed for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
being demanded of what condition they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſome ſaid, they were <hi>Taylors,</hi> ſome <hi>Embroyderers,</hi>
and the like. By the latter end of this weeke, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you our number will exceed thoſe of the Earl
of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> of which we are now rightly informed
by the ſeverall Priſoners we have taken, And if

Vengance inſtore for us, and the whole Nation:
The King having no other Ambition, but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Proteſtant Religion, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of the Fundamental Lawes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
We have publique thanks for this Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
enjoyned by the King; I have all this while
heard of, and ſeene the many lyes permitted and
contrived by them; but I could never imagine
men ſo irreligious, ſo impudent before God, as to
<pb facs="tcp:59168:4"/>
give publicke thanks for the great Victory over
the Cavaleers; which is as falſe as God is true:
