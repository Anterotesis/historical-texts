         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it neceſſary for the peace

ſettle the <hi>Militia</hi> thereof, did
for that purpoſe prepare an
Ordinance of Parliament, and with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
did preſent the ſame to His Majeſtie for
His Royall aſſent, Who notwithſtanding the

ſeverall reaſons offered by them of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
thereof, for the ſecuring of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Perſon, and the peace and ſafety of his

of the truſt repoſed in them as the
repreſentative body of the Kingdome, to
make an Ordinance by Authority of both
Houſes, to ſettle the <hi>Militia,</hi> warranted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by the fundamentall Lawes of the Land:
his Majeſty taking notice thereof, did by
<pb facs="tcp:33953:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 3 -->
ſeverall Meſſages invite them to ſettle the
ſame by Act of Parliament, affirming in His
Majeſties Meſſage ſent in Anſwer to the
Petition of both Houſes preſented to His
Majeſty at <hi>Yorke, March</hi> 26. That he alwaies
thought it neceſſary the ſame ſhould be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and that he never denyed the thing, only
denyed the way; and for the matter of it, took
exceptions only to the Preface, as a thing
not ſtanding with His honour to conſent to,
and that Himſelfe was excluded in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and for a time unlimited: Whereupon
the Lords and Commons being deſirous to
give His Majeſtie all ſatisfaction that might
be, even to the leaſt tittle of forme, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance;
and when His Majeſty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to offer them a Bill ready drawne, did for
no other cauſe then to manifeſt their hearty
affection to comply with His Majeſties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
and obtaine his conſent, entertaine the
ſame; and in the meane time no way decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Ordinance, and to expreſſe their
earneſt zeale to correſpond with His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
deſire (in all things that might conſiſt
with the peace and ſafety of the Kingdome,
and the truſt repoſed in them) did paſſe that
<pb facs="tcp:33953:3"/>
Bill, and therein omitted the preamble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
before the Ordinance, limitted the
time to leſſe then two yeeres, and confined
the authority of the Lievtenants to theſe
three particulars, namely Rebellion, Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and forraigne Invaſion, and returned
the ſame to his Majeſty for His royall aſſent.
But all theſe expreſſions of affection and
loyalty, all thoſe deſires and earneſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to comply with His Majeſty, hath (to
their great griefe and ſorrow) produced no
better effect then an abſolute denyall, even
of that which His Majeſty by His former
Meſſages, as we conceive, had Promiſed; the
advice of evill and wicked Counſels, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſtill more credit with Him, then that of
His great Counſell of Parliament, in a matter
of ſo high importance, that the ſafety of His
Kingdome, and the peace of his people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon it. But now what muſt be the
exceptions to this Bill? not any ſure, that
was to the Ordinance; for a care was taken
to give ſatisfaction in all theſe particulars.
Then the exception was becauſe that the
diſpoſing and execution thereof was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to both Houſes of Parliament, and His
<pb facs="tcp:33953:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 4 -->
Majeſty excluded: and now that by the
Bill, the Power and execution is aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and reduced to particulars, and the
Law of the Realme made the Rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
His Majeſtie will not truſt the Perſons.
The power is too great, too unlimited to truſt
them with. But what is that power? Is it any
other, but in expreſſe termes to ſuppreſſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
Inſurrection, and forraigne invaſion?
And who are thoſe Perſons? are they not
ſuch as were nominated by the great Counſel
of the Kingdome, and aſſented to by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.
And is it too great a power to truſt
thoſe perſons with the ſuppreſſion of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
Inſurrection, and forraigne Invaſion?
ſurely the moſt wicked of them that adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Majeſty to this Anſwer cannot ſuggeſt,
but that it is neceſſary for the ſafety of his
Majeſties Royall Perſon and the peace of the
Kingdome, ſuch a power ſhould bee put in
ſome hands. And there is no pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to the perſons. His Majeſty for the
ſpace of above fifteene yeares together,
thought not a power farre exceeding this
to be too great to intruſt particular perſons
with, to whoſe will the Lives and Liberties
<pb facs="tcp:33953:4"/>
of his people by Martiall Lawes were made
ſubject, for ſuch was the power given to Lord
Lievtenants, and Deputie Lievtenants in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Countie of this Kingdome, and that
without the conſent of his people, or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Law. But now in caſe of extreame
neceſſity, upon the advice of both Houſes of
Parliament for no longer ſpace then two
yeares, a leſſer power, and that for the
ſafety of King and people, is thought too
great to truſt particular perſons with, though
named by both Houſes of Parliament, and
approved of by his Majeſtie himſelfe. And
ſurely if there bee a neceſſity to ſettle the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi>
(which his Majeſty was pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe)
the perſons cannot bee intruſted with
leſſe power then this to have it all effectuall.
And the Preſidents of former Ages when
there hapened a neceſſity to raiſ ſuch a power,
never ſtraitned that power to a narrower
compaſſe, witneſſe the Commiſſions of Array
in ſeverall Kings Raignes, and often iſſued
out by the conſent and the authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
The Lords and Commons therefore
intruſted with the ſafety of the Kingdome, and
peace of the People, (which they call God
<pb facs="tcp:33953:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 5 -->
to witneſſe is their onely aime) finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
denied theſe their ſo neceſſary, and juſt
demands, and that they can never be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
before God or Man, if they ſhould ſuffer
the ſafety of the Kingdome and peace of the
people to bee expoſed to the malice of the
malignant party at home, or the fury of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
from abroad. And knowing no other
way to encounter the imminent &amp; approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
danger, but by putting the people into a
ſit poſture of defence, doe reſolve to put
their ſaid <hi>Ordinance</hi> in preſent execution, and
doe require all perſons in authority by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the ſaid <hi>Ordinance</hi> forthwith to put the
ſame in execution, and all others to obey it,
according to the fundamentall lawes of the
Kingdome in ſuch caſes, as they tender the
upholding of the true Proteſtant Religion,
the ſafety of his Majeſties Perſon, and his
Royall Poſterity, the peace of the Kingdome,
and the being of this Common-wealth.</p>
