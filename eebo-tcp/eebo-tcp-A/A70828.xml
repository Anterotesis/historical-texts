            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Arious, and promiscuous are the Lords dealings with the Godly and wicked in this life; God doth not infallibly feed his choisest Saints with the sweet-meates of prosperity, and let the wicked onely lye under the lash of biting calamity, woe, and misery. No, for if prosperity did ever wait upon Gods people, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity attend the ungodly, then we might easily find out the wayes of God, and know pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>True it is, the children of God may more justly expect freedome and mercy from the hand of their Father, then the servants of Satan can doe; the Saints have the Word, and the precious Promises of God to build upon, and by which God (as I may say) is ingaged to his faithfull ones, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This 37 Psalme is little but a reitteration of comfortable promises to the people of God, inter-mixt with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall directions how to behave themselves under their tryalls. I might be long in opning the coherents of my Text, but I will not dwell at the doore. The whole matter of the Psalme may be considered under two head.</p>

            <p>First, Gods gracious directions to the Saints, how to carry themselves under their tryalls, God would not have the Saints to breake out in passion against the wicked, nor once have so much as an envious thought because of their vain p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

doers, neither be thou envious against the workes of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut downe like the grasse, and wither as the greene herbe.</hi> ver, 1.2. Which is, as if <hi>David</hi> should say, take example by me, have no hard thoughts of God, because many times the wicked thrive, and his owne people are kept under; that enemies live on the sweet, and you taste the bitter. Let them alone with it, grudge them not for it, it is but an empty, fading, comfortlesse happinesse which will presently be gone, their prosperity is but like cut grasse, it will wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther presently, and then all is gone with them; earth is all the heaven they have, therefore envie them not for that, its as little as you can wish them.</p>
            <p>Then in the next place, <hi>David</hi> calls the Saints to a further exercise of their grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, three of which I will observe to you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi> calls the Saints to the exercise of Faith, <hi>Trust in the Lord and doe good, so shalt thou dwell in the Land,</hi> and verily thou shalt be fed, <hi>vers</hi> 3. That is, keepe to thy rule, walke closely with God, and trust him for the rest, feare it not, verily, certainly who ever falls, thou shalt stand, who ever wants, thou shalt be sweetly and fully provided for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>David</hi> calls the Saints to an earnest love to God, and delight in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and they shall not be disappoynted of their hopes, <hi>Delight thy selfe also in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart,</hi> vers. 4. which as if <hi>David</hi> should say, notwithstanding you may have narrow thoughts of Gods fulnesse, and that he spends too much on his enemies. Yet trouble not your selves with those vaine feares, whatsoever God lets out to strangers, he will reserve enough for his children and houshold servants: doe but you goe on chearfully, carry on your services with love and delight, and you shall have as much as you can or doe look for, you shall have as much as heart can wish, this is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond direction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>David</hi> calls the Saints to patience and contentednesse, though God doe not presently manifest his approbation of their righteous and holy convers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, the latter and greater part of this Psalme is taken up in the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the different ends God makes with the wicked and godly.

            <p>The first of those is, the reason or ground why God calls out the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi> a cruell persecutor against his owne people, and that was for their stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse and disobedience; God calls, but they will not regard, God would faine win them by faire promises, as you may read at large, <hi>vers.</hi> 3.4.5.6. yet they would not hearken, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>Therefore thus saith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I desire you in the next place, to consider the mercy of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, notwithstanding their untowardnesse. The King of <hi>Babilon</hi> must come to humble Israel; yea, and the King of <hi>Babilon</hi> did come to doe Gods worke, and he did it to the purpose, as you may read a sad and story of it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 52. Now Israel was brought to a low ebbe indeed, now they were in the hand of the enemy; yet according to the promise of God (urged before) God will not here leave them. When the Lord gave that large commission to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> it was with limitation; <hi>These Nations shall serve the King of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon</hi> 70. <hi>years,</hi> vers. 11. <hi>And then many Nations and great Kings shall serve themselves of him, Ier.</hi> 27.7. Now then, all things considered, what hath this wicked tyrant got to himselfe? Gods work is done, Israel humbled, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> must perish.

            <p n="2">2.<hi>Reas.</hi> The second reason is drawne from the promise of God, God hath promised peace and deliverance to his Saints; and therefore it shall come, God will not, nay, God cannot be worse then his word; God will not deceive those that trust to him, that depend upon him. Deliverance may be deserved, but it shall not faile: <hi>The needy shall not alwayes be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the expectation of the poore shall not perish for ever,</hi> Psal. 9.18. God in his wisedom may see cause to withhold deliverance from his afflicted Saints, but he doth not forget them; they shall not perish under their burden: God will come in with deliverance, and a seasonable deliverance too, he will not stay an houre too long with it, <hi>It shall come in due time,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.6. It shall come in a time when it shall doe them most good. Amongst men, one that carries the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of an honest man, will have a great care to keep his word, his promise, though it may be to his losse; if he promise, he will make it good. This is one of the marks which <hi>David</hi> describes a godly man by, <hi>He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not,</hi> Psal. 15.4. And doe you thinke the great God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth will fall short of a godly man?

He hath said it, and he will make it good, <hi>He will build up his Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevaile againts it,</hi> Mat. 16.18. Nay, I will tell you further, the the Church of God shall not onely out-stand all power and persecutions of the wicked, but shall over-power them, and destroy them. I will onely open one Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, <hi>when the Lord shall have accomplished his whole worke upon mount Zion,</hi> Isa. 10.12. When the Church is fit for deliverance, even in the dayes of these proud perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Kings, while they are yet in their power, the Lord will raise up a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Saints which shall never be destroyed.

            <p>Oh! (If we may yet beg it) that the Lord would open the eyes, and soften the heart of our King to consider this; Alas, alas, little doth the King and his party know, what they lose by that they call getting: that which they thinke helpes them, undoeth them. You may thinke I speake strange paradoxes, but I will cleare it to you. I say, victories destroy the enemie two wayes.</p>
            <p>First, a victory got by the enemy, fills their hearts with cruelty, their mouth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with blasphemy, and fires them on to destruction.</p>
            <p>That this may not seeme a fancy of my braine, I will give you Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proofe, examples from the word: A victory got by the wicked, fills their heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with cruelty. Having once dipped their hands in blood, being blooded (as we said by dogs) they grow bold and desperate, they grow hardy and expert in murder, they are lesse mercifull, and more cruell every battell more then other. See in the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> Army, when they came against <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: At the first victory, or at the first taking of <hi>Ierusalem, Nebuchadnezzar</hi> tooke the King prisoner, and put the City to a fine. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.6, 7. But when he layd Siege the second time, and tooke <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> observe what a fearfull desolation he made of that glorious City, <hi>He slew their young men with the sword, in the house of their Sanctuary (where there lives should have beene saved) and had no compassion on the young man, or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age.</hi> And they burnt he house of God, and brake downe the wall of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and burnt all the pallaces thereof with fire, and abundance of the like inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine cruelty, as you may read at large in this very chapter. Againe, victories fill the mouths of the wicked with blasphemy against God, cause them ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was the very ground of <hi>Rabshakehs</hi> blasphemy, when he would have drawne the people from <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and this was his blasphemie; <hi>Let not Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying; The Lord will surely deliver us, and this City shall not be delivered into the hand of the King of Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> 2 King. 18.30.

Where are the gods of <hi>Hamath</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pad</hi>? and the like. <hi>Who are they among all the Gods of the Countries, that have delivered their Country out of mine hand?

                  </gap>d should deliver Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem out of my hand,</hi> 2 King. 18.34, 35. And then lastly, power and pride fires on the wicked to their owne destruction, because they prevaile once, they thinke to prosper alwayes; this was the destruction of the King of <hi>Ai</hi> and his City, because Israel was routed in one assault at <hi>Ai</hi> (when they had an <hi>Achan</hi> amongst them) the men of <hi>Ai</hi> thinke Israel must alwayes have the worst. This was discovered to Israel by <hi>Ioshuah</hi> when he made his second attempt, and gave order for the laying of his Ambush. They will (sayth he) come out after us, till we have drawne them from the City: for they will say, <hi>They flee before us as at the first,</hi> Josh. 8.5, 6. And so accordingly, they did even to their utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine at that very time, as you may read in the sequell of the chapper. Thus I have given you undenyable testimony of this truth: but indeed, I needed not to have gone so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ar for proofe, one dayes conference with the Kings caves, would give you full assurance of what I said. This is one of the wayes in which the King loses by getting; a word of the second and I will proceed.</p>
            <p>I said in the second place, the King loses by that which he calls getting, by the victories he gets over (his Subjects) but Gods Saints. In all this, the people of God are more fitted for deliverance, and the cause is extreamely forwarded. What earnest prayers are now put up? What deep groanes, and pleading-blood, goes daily to God by this meanes? The King had better to have a whole Army of men against him, then the blood of one Saint; These Saints which the King hath slaine, fight with him night and day. They are now with God in heaven, and they are continually hastening and moving God to fulfill his promises, and avenge their blood. I pray you see how the Text is to prove this, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>I saw under the Altar the (Soules) of them who were slaine for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held. And they cryed, (yea) with a loud with voice, saying; How long, O Lord, holy and true, do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I beseech you, who ever you be, consider this for the Lords sake, take heed of neglecting, abusing either meanes or gifts. What a miserable case are those in which have not Christ, when parts, Sermons, Sacraments, all increase damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? On the other side, is not Christ, despised Christ, worth the having, which helpes all, gives a right to all, guides in all? I have here a large subject to treat off, and I hope you will not expect that I should be very briefe, being such a Christ-concerning poynt, a soule-concerning poynt, but that I should fully open it before I passe. I might indeed run out into many parts, but I will contract my thoughts, and handle onely some particulars, which shall be these.</p>
            <p>First, I will endeavour to discover and set out, the wretched estate of the wicked who are out of Christ, and then come to shew the excellency of the Saints priviledges, who have a right and interest in Jesus Christ. I will after this lay downe some directions for the use of the Saints, as certaine speciall helpes to bring a soule to Christ, and close up all with some choice Motives.</p>
            <p>I must begin with the lesse pleasing part, the wretched estate of the wicked, who have interest in Christ. But this hath its use as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will then begin there. I must tell you, that wicked men, who have no right, no interest in Christ, have no right to any thing that is Gods; I meane no such right as savingly to doe them good, to be bettered by them; and I will instance in some par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

That the Saints are in the eye of Christ, he is still looking upon them, &amp; therefore the Apostles and faithfull Ministers of Christ, have their hearts with the Saints where ever they be, whether present or absent, the Saints are cared for, they are daily mentioned at the Throne of Grace. The Saints priviledges more then others, they above others, and so much for the first particular.</p>
            <p>In the second place, wicked men and women, who have no trust in Christ, have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, which gives him a right to these holy ordinances, and yet an unbeleever. For my part, I know not a letter in the Scripture which gives the least allowance to any such, but much to the contrary. <hi>Paul</hi> is very exact noting out the Israel of God, <hi>Rom</hi> 9. &amp; puts a difference both in persons and priviledges. <hi>They are not all Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And these are the true Israelites indeed, to whom pertaineth the Adoption, and the glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the service of God, and the promises, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. There is no great difficulty in the Apostles expressions, but yet he cleares it, and puts it out of all dispute in another place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>To Abraham and his seede were the promises made, He saith not, and to seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy seede, which is Christ.</hi> The Apostle here, writing to the revolting <hi>Galathians,</hi> takes them up sharply for leauing the faith, and hanging upon the Law, plainly shewing, that <hi>beleevers are the seed of Abraham, vers.</hi> 7. Yet least after all, they should stil rest in security out of some unbottomed and false hopes of being <hi>Abraham's seed: Paul</hi> declares who they are, as if he should say, <hi>indeed the promises were made to Abraham &amp; to his seed</hi>; all thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that are contained in these promises, are the priviledges of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, but yet not to all his seed neither. When God made the Covenant to <hi>Abraham,</hi> hee did not say <hi>to thy seeds,</hi> (for so many would have been contained) but of <hi>thy seed</hi> (Gen. 17.10.) <hi>which is Christ</hi>: All the promises, and all the priviledges in the promises, belong only to Christians, as they are beleevers, and tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They are usurpers, they have no right to this marriage Supper, <hi>They eate and drinke their own damnation; not having faith to discern Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29. And so for baptisme, wicked and unbeleevers have no right to it, nor their Children. It is a peculiar priviledg of the Saints, of beleevers. I do

not observe that the Apostles did ever administer this Ordinance to any but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. When the Eunuch asked <hi>Philip,</hi> (saying) what doth hinder me to baptized? <hi>Philip</hi> said, <hi>If thou beleevest with all thy heart, thou maist,</hi> Acts 8.36, 37.

            <p>Thirdly and lastly, the wicked who have no interest in Christ, can have no share in the Churches peace. When the Lord shall make up this promise, and deliver those that trust to him, the wicked shall have no part with Gods people. The wicked are not within the promise. Nay God has promised the contrary: <hi>There is no peace to the wicked saith my God,</hi> Isa. 48.22. When times of peace, riches, and honour, and liberty given to the Saints, when the Gospell times so long promised to the Churches, shall come? Then will the wicked mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of the wicked begin; Then shall their times of sorrow and sadnesse come in; They will but then enter. I need not seeke far for Scripture proofes of these trueths; It is very plaine all along in this 37. Psalme, but that you may know there is other cleare Texts for the purpose. Take some time to reade the seven Chap. of <hi>Dan.</hi> with the 18. &amp; 19.

Now we will view the adverse part, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, and observe the time of the wicked. The wicked you know were ever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the godly, and so is their condition. The Saints have a hard entrance, but a happy issue. The wicked is cleane contray. They have a plaine and easie path, but death and hell are at the end. They have a time to get, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight and full title to any thing as the Saints have, and I will shew you how they differ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50585:13"/>First, wicked men, unbeleevers, men out of Christ, may have much put into their hands, when God intends to make use of them; yet it is onely as they are subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto his glory in the Saints good. They shall have little comfort in what they have, while they have it; they have them with much trouble and disquiet. There is many times, eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a hell in great men houses, because God bestowes not outward things upon them out of love, not to doe them good. But the Saints have all from the love of God in Christ. Though they have never so little, yet they are happy, they live comfortably; what they have does them good. Hence was that proverbiall speech of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 15.16. This is the difference.</p>
            <p>Secondly, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wicked men out of Christ, have no right to any thing that is Gods, by vertue of any promise from God. They are not in Covenant with God, &amp; so God is not theirs, nor engaged to them by promise, only what he bestows upon them by courtesie and meere providence. It was Gods expression to <hi>Abraham, I will give to thee and to thy seede, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 17.8. Now beleevers are the seede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they are in Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> with God, they may claim a priviledg as children, they have a right by promise from God. This is the second difference.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the wicked who have not Christ, have all they possesse without Christ, they have the gift, without God; They have the gifts without grace to use them, and then you may know how it will goe with them. You know it will doe a man little good to have a whole shop full of curious tooles, and know not how to used them, But the Saints have God and the gift, yea God in the gift. They have the holy Spirit brought along in ever mercy, which will helpe them to manage all, and guide them in all, and so sweetens all to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> turns all to a happy and blessed use, that all is for their good. It is the promise of Iesus Christ, &amp; he will see it made good to his Saints. <hi>The Comforter, which is the holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, hee shall teach you all things,</hi> Iohn 14.6. This is the 3, difference. I will now come to the second answer to the objection.</p>

You know it is not a little common fire that will melt gold. It must be a strong fire, a hot fire: Now Gods Saints in Scripture, are compared to gold, and though gold (the chiefest of mettalls) yet it hath drosse, <hi>which must be purged out and tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctions; And for this purpose God makes use of wicked Kings and great men, and in this sence God calls them his servants, as I mentioned at large in the Reasons. Alas, the very greatest and sharpest persecutions that ever the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked raised, did the Saints good; it exercised their graces, refined them, and made them shine bright. Though persecutions and wastings may seemingly appeare to threaten the ruine of the Church, the people of God, Yet the same hand which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them, turns for the good of the Saints, they are necessary, the Saints could not be without them. God sees this, and therefore God suffers the wicked to hate his people that they should not fall in love with the world; That is dangerous, that will undo them indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50585:13"/>That which the wicked doth, doth doe the Saints good: It fils up the measure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Consider all well, and you shall finde that the Churches enemies, are her friends; their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors are her promoters, they helpe on the Lords worke mightily; all the plottings and powers of the enemy shall promote Gods businesse which he hath in hand mightily. God makes use of all their wits parts and powers, for the advancement of his glory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd the Churches good; though the wicked doe it out of self-ends, and intend nothing lesse then Gods service and the good of his people; yet God doth (&amp; they shall perish when they have done) too. I will give you cleare texts for what I say; see it first in the 10. of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> there God seems mightily to be taken with the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> as though now he would set up him, and give up <hi>Israel</hi> into his hand; he shall have the whipping &amp; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of poor <hi>Israel, ver.</hi> 5, 6. now the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> thinks all is his owne, but little imagines what God has in it; he intends one thing and God another; he intends to destroy <hi>Israel</hi> and set up himselfe. God intends onely <hi>Israels</hi> corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and the <hi>Assyrians</hi> ruine: God cals out the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> only to whip <hi>Israel</hi> out of hypocrisie into sincerity; how be it, he (the King of <hi>Assyria)</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not so, neither doth his heart thinke so, but it is in his heart to destroy, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and doth the King effect his desires? no, no, he doth Gods worke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der self-seeking, and when thats done which God looks for, when <hi>

Self-seekers may doe Gods businesse, but you see what they finde, God may make use of the wicked great ones of the world the more effectually to accomplish what he intends, and yet they are not betterd by it; in the end God whips them with their owne rod. This the second Answer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God may suffer the wicked outwardly to prosper and get into great strength and power, to show and make known his power in delivering his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from them, when they are mighty. We account it nothing, its not worth speaking on, to see a Gyant, a great strong man to winde and turn a little stick out of the hand of a little Boy, a poore childe; but it would be recorded for a wonder, to see such a childe, violently to take a weapon out of the hand of a Gyant; it would not have been mentioned for a miracle if <hi>Goliah</hi> had kild little <hi>David</hi> with his sword and his club; but here is the wonder, that little <hi>David</hi> should kill <hi>Goliah</hi> with a stone out of a sling a boyes play, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.48 49.

Now therefore that he may be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in delivering his Saints, he will suffer the wicked to get into great strength and power: You may see it evidently in the case of <hi>Israels</hi> deliverance out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> God had promised <hi>Israel</hi> to bring them to <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet he would have them know it was he which did it· and what course doth God take to make <hi>Israel</hi> sensible of what he intended to doe for them? if you marke the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, you shall find that God raises up a potent enemy to oppose and oppresse, that so his power might be more manifest in <hi>Israels</hi> deliverance. These are the words of God spoken to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who would not let <hi>Israel</hi> goe to <hi>Canaan,</hi> but kept them long in bondage. In very deed, for this cause have I raised thee up (given power and strength into thy hand) for to shew in thee my power, and that my Name may be declared throughout all the earth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.16. Which is as if God should say, if <hi>Israel</hi> did not meet with some opposition in their journey to <hi>Canaan,</hi> if it proved not a difficult businesse, I should be little looked at; but I have therefore raised up thee <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and have hardned thy heart to such a pitch of cruelty towards them, that now when they are in streights, when they are over-powered and cannot help themselves now they may find experimentally of what strength and power I the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty am of, in working this great deliverance for my poore helplesse peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and I shall by this have the fame of my goodnesse and greatnesse spread abroad, that others may love and feare me. And now I hope I have fully and cleerly answered the Objection, I will in the next place come to lay downe some directions how a poore soule may get to Christ.</p>
            <p>When I here speak of directions or rules, whereby a poore soule is brought to have acquaintance with Christ, and so by faith a right and interest in all that is Chists; I would be understood that I doe not attribute the worke of Gods free Grace upon the soule to man endeavour, as though I put Salvation into his will and power, but my intention is (so neere as God shall enable me) to set you in the way, and direct you to the use of such meanes and helps, as God hath revealed in his Word, and through the sanctification of his spirit, makes them effectuall for the bringing of the soule to Christ, and working of an assurance in that soule that Christ is his; this being presupposed I proceed.</p>
            <p>

               </gap>, I would have thee learne to know thy selfe under a double condition, in a twofold estate, under these Notions. First, thy nothing, thy worse then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and these explaine thus; first, learne to know thy nothing, the frailty of thy ourward man, thy body, thy mortall body, look back upon the matter and composition whereof thou art made, and this will help discover to thee the need of Christ. The very first and perfectest man that ever was in the world (except God-man, the man Christ Jesus) was at best (in his body) but <hi>Adam,</hi> red earth, he was but a little foulded dust, that was the matter whereof he was made, and into that he must againe be dissolved; <hi>dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou returne, Gen.</hi> 3.19. Hare's a small businesse to be proud on, here's a poore matter to glory in, here's a weake foundation to build upon for a long life, and after repentance; what is a dust-heap? you know well a shoure of raine will dissolve it, a blast of wind will scatter it; and such is the matter of all our bodies, a very nothing; if there had not been a word more in all the Bible, this had been enough to manifest the bodies mortality; but the al-wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> God which knowes best the deceitfulnesse of our hearts to beleeve such truth against our selves, would not leave it without a full discovery: Hence it is, that in all the course of the Scriptures, the nothing of mans life, the naturall being of the body here upon earth, is so frequently compared to nothings; that you may the better know the certainty of what I say, I will pick up some here and there. <hi>Iob</hi> compares man but to a flower (nay not to a Flower in his full groth and in lhe time it would last, but to a flower) that is cut down; (and as if in this expression, mans mortality was not yet sufficiently discribed; <hi>Iob</hi> likens mans life to another nothing, to a more meere nothing a shadow, and as though the nothing were not yet fully cleered, he adds this epethite of this nothing) flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) <hi>he sleeth also like a shadow and continueth not, Iob</hi> 14.2. Here you see how sensible <hi>Iob</hi> was of all mens mortality, and so of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I may have nothing to doe but dye: <hi>David</hi> also hath many the like expressions to the same purpose, but I will not insist upon them, onely give a touch upon one or two and so passe, Psal. 102. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> equals his life but to a shadow, and a shadow declining; to grasse and that not greene, but withered; <hi>My dayes are like a shadow that decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and I am withered like grasse,</hi> ver. 11. Againe, <hi>David</hi> Psal. 39. is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the length of his life by measure, and then drawes his conclusion upon it; if you know not the place, you will wonder much at <hi>Davids</hi> Geomatry,


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50585:15"/>
and more at the strangenesse of his conclusion; he sets all at a low rate, he measures his life but at a hands bredth, and cals it a nothing, a vanity: <hi>Behold thou hast made my dayes as an hand bredth, and mine age is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, learne to know thy worse then nothing, study to know the dangerous estate and condition of thy soule in respect of sinne; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect thy thoughts and call to mind what shall become of thy soule if thou hast not a Saviour; looke to it as well as you can, thou hast two weights hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up thy soule, the least of which will drag thee to hell, if there be not help: Thou hast the burden of originall sinne, and that's death; <hi>In Adam all dye,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. that is, as we by nature come from <hi>Adam,</hi> so by nature we lye guilty of his sinne, and by the sinne derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> we lye liable to eternall death; this is one heavy weight.

Thit we call sinne, is a soule procuring destruction, it captivates the soule, leads it from Christ and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and presseth it downe to hell; hence is that complaint taken up by <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death</hi>; that is, as if <hi>Paul</hi> should have said, I find the power of naturall lusts &amp; corruptions working so contrary to the will of God and the rule of his spirit, that were it not for the hopes of a Saviour, I was in a sad condition, I was in a wretched estate; for who is it, or what is it in all the world that could help my soule out of hel? who shall deliver me from the death and damnation which the sinne of my nature, my flesh (the body) hath brought me to? Alas! the Creature cannot comfort me, nothing in the world can save me but onely Iesus Christ who dyed for me; and here is the hope, help, joy &amp; cause of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; <hi>I thank God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again these sinnes and evils which we commit are called iniquities, and these are also soule-weights: If you dare beleeve <hi>David,</hi> he will tell you he found iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be a weight, yea an unsupportable weight; they let him have no quiet

For your helpe herein, you must be frequent in the Scriptures, heare them, read them, they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the Promises, and the Priviledges which shall come in to you by Christ.

I say to lay all things together, and consider well every thing a part, you would thinke it no wonder to see men so ignorant in the wayes and truths of God, notwithstanding so much Gospell-meanes and Gospell light we doe injoy.

A man that would keepe himselfe warme, will goe to the fire; if you want water, you goe to draw it out of the Well, and goe to the Spring; a childe in his wants will goe to his Father. Thus you must doe, or else you cannot be helped; this must be the course you are to take to get spirituall knowledge; Resort unto the Ministers of God, acquaint your selves with experienced Christians, who are able to speake out of knowledge what they have found God to their poore soules. Be diligent in hearing Sermons, and reading the Scriptures; never any man yet who endeavoured ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tye thy selfe to this soule businesse; propound (as justly thou mayest doe) to thy selfe weighty reasons; as the necessity of this soule worke, the danger of delay, the uncertainty of the time of life: say to thy selfe, let goe this Sermon, and it may be I let goe all, I may never live to heare another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, its no wonder to have men and women Sermon-hearers and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-readers all their dayes, and yet never come to the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jesus Christ (as <hi>Paul</hi> cals it <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.) if we consider how unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredly and carelesly most goe either to reading the Word or hearing of Sermons?

The way to obtaine is to goe to God for it; Are not the Ordinances Gods? Is not true knowledge Gods? is not Christ, Gods? and all Gods? then if you would speed, you must goe to God by prayer; Gods promises runnes upon these termes, <hi>Aske and it shall be given you; seeke, and yee shall find; knocke, and it shall be opened to you, Mat.</hi> 7.7. What can you desire more? you see God is ready, and Jesus Christ is willing to doe you good: Nay, I may adde further, Iesus Christ would have us to make use of this, and see what the event shall be; he would have us to take this way upon liking, and he will passe his word for a good is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, it's no strange thing to find even old Sermon. hearers ignorant they record so little: To heare Sermons and not to write, is like the taking of water in a sive: You may have something of every thing, and nothing of any thing; the best memories are but bad at remembring all things; as in a sive (for I can compare one memory to nothing better) there may hang some drops after you have poured in much water and yet if you take not them, they are presently dried up: So after the hearing of a Sermon, you may here and there remember a Notion, a passage; but if you take it not presently and put it sure it's gone: I am sure you will not deale with the world as you doe by your soules; you keep a bill of Parish-taxes, you keep Shop-books for your takings in and layings out; be perswaded to keep a Soule-book, that you may know how your spirituall estate stands, what increase or decrease of Graces you have: This recording of revealed truths and soul-experiences from God, would be of admirable use, of great importance in times of trouble and tryall. The calling to memory of former experiences of Gods love, power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, helps a soule exceedingly to trust God for the future, it strengthens faith mightily in extremities: <hi>Moses</hi> makes great use of former providences and deliverances, and urges <hi>Israel</hi> to further obedience and faith, from what they had found God.

Remorse for sinne and thoughts of obedience, are gifts and graces wrought by the Spirit of God in thee; these are not the fruits of nature comming from thee; present paine may worke and stirre up a griefe for thy misery and sorrow, but never procures a sorrow for sinne; I might give you divers presidents, but I will take up with this cleere precept, <hi>It is God who worketh in us both to will and to doe of his good pleasure,</hi> Phil. 2.13. that is, all our good thoughts of turning unto God, and the strength of all our abilities according to the rule of Christ is all from God.

First, by Christ, thou shalt have all these soul-destroying sinnes (in themselves) these heart-trembling sinnes, these conscience-biting sinnes as cleerly taken away by Jesus Christ, as if thou never hadst commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any such: Thy conscience shall be at quiet, and the devill himselfe shall not have any thing to say to thee for them: God hath laid all thy sinnes, and the sinnes of all the Elect upon Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. Christ hath suffered and satisfied the wrath of his Father for them, <hi>it is finished, John</hi> 19.30. Jesus Christ hath done this for them; and hence is that challenge which the Apostle takes up against the devill, the world, yea conscience; <hi>who is it shall lay any thing (any manner of sinne) to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, who is he that condemneth? Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. all is put to Christ, Christ doth all. Secondly, Iesus Christ doth not onely justifie a soule before God, but he reconciles God to the soule, he makes a sweet peace and friendship betweene them who were at enmity; and the Apostle makes this worke of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an argument of eternall salvation, from which we may draw the certainty of both: <hi>For</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Sonne; much more we being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5.10. Thirdly and lastly, (because I will hasten) Iesus Christ will send the holy Ghost, the Spirit, to direct and sanctifie all those who have an interest in him: If once Christ be thine, Christ will have a care of thee; thou shalt have a guide to lead thee in all the wayes of truths or God: Iesus Christ knowes well the failings of the Saints.

               <hi>Signe</hi> 1. The first Signe whereby a Christian may know he hath an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in Christ is a sound and sincere love to Christ for Christ alone: It's not enough to love Christ for the Loaves; so Christ hath lovers and followers too many, to love Christ because you outwardly thrive and get by Christ; Christ finds fault with this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.26. It is not enough to love Christ with the Loaves with the world, this also Christ cannot away with, this will not doe, yee cannot doe it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24. but Christ will be loved for himselfe, he will have all your love, and have you love him onely, that is, to love him above all, more then all; Christ would not have any thing here below to stand in computition with him; if any thing must be parted with, let it be any thing, all things save Christ, Goods, Friends, Life, are all to he left for the love of Christ when they cannot stand together: This is the meaning of tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if you solemnly and seriously aske your hearts, they will tell you whether you love a naked Christ, a despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christ; I say your hearts will in some measure tell you how they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; what longings have you after Christ? what inquires doe you make af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ? what delight have yee in the Saints? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Love these, and love Christ; neglect these, and you care not for Iesus Christ: Now then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have these taken thy heart and ravished thy soule? are these the cause of thy rejoycing, and the want of these thy sorrow? doest thou prize the Word of God above all the Words wealth? doest thou love to follow Christ under all contempts? canst thou rejoyce in Christ and account thy interest in him to be dearer to thee then all other honours and priviledges? I say, here are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible signes of a sincere love to Christ, when you can love any thing for Christ and all things for Christ, and onely for Christ; can you love Christians as they are Christs. Ordinances as they are Christs? doe you the more love Christians where there is the more of Christ in them? do you the more love pure Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances

as they are the more agreeable to the mind of Christ? certainly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you can doe this, unlesse your hearts close with Christ in these, I can give you no hopes that you either love Christ, or have any interest in Christ: This is not my owne rule, but the rule of Iesus Christ; this is not my word, but the Word of Iesus Christ: In one place, Iesus Christ propounds a brotherly love to be a knowne signe of being in him: <hi>By this shall all men know that yee are my Disciples if yee have love one to another,</hi> Ioh. 13.35. the other place is Joh. 14.15. <hi>If yee love me, keep my Commandements</hi>; that is, if you will make it appeared, and manifest that you love me, let it be knowne by your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in walking according to the rule I have given you to observe; you see how strict Christ is, and therefore it is not good for us to depart from Christ's rule, from what he warrants us in: I say againe (for I cannot say it too often) for the Lords sake take heed that you deceive not your selves in the cleering up your Evidences for Heaven, your right to Christ; you must not thinke because you live in the ayre of the Gospell amongst Christians, and Ordinances, and Bibles, that this can make you Christians, and intitle you to Christ; no, no, it's not faint prayers will bring a man to Heaven; <hi>every one that saith Lord, Lord, shall not enter into the Kingdome of heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in heaven,</hi> Mat. 7.21.

               </gap>se bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, the Apostle tels them plaine, it is neither one nor the other will bring them to Heaven; it's onely the worke of faith by love: <hi>For</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) in Iesus Christ, neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. all these outward priviledges advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth a soule nothing, unlesse it can sensibly close with Christ in a full perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the love of Christ to the soule in the great worke of Redemption, and that it selfe have a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch I have committed unto him,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12. This was a sweet frame in <hi>Paul,</hi> here was a right faith; and assuredly the Saints have the same, they have the like pretious faith, 2 Pet. 1.1. all the Saints now have the like faith the Apostles had for nature or matter, though not the like measure of faith. Every christian is willing, nay desirous to give up all to the disposall of Christ; they well know that Iesus Christ is a better keeper of any thing then they themselves are, and therefore they are desirous to put all into his hand: christians will trust Christ with estates, wives, children, Religion, bodies and soules; this is the faith of christians; it's a true faith and it never fails: True it is an hypocrite, a meer knowing professor may goe farre, as the young man did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. but they cannot trust Iesus Christ with all: they may stand the calm and make a goodly shew, but in the storme, when troubles, sufferings, and losses come in with profession of Christ, they are lost too they are gone, they want foundation, they have not faith to trust Christ under difficulties, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.26, 27. they know not that the Lord will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge (a hiding-place a defence) in times of trouble, (as <hi>David</hi> did) or else they would put their trust in God, Ps. 9.9, 10. now then, bring your hearts to the rule, try them whether they will be willing to close with Iesus Christ, and trust him with all and for all, if you have a faith that can thus see, acknowledge and trust Christ with all, it's good, it's firme; it is a faith given by God wrought by the holy Ghost, it's more then flesh and blood can doe, thus to trust Iesus Christ. And therefore I will conclude upon this faith, as Iesus Christ did of the same faith in Peter: <hi>This a firme faith, and the gates of hell shall not prevaile against it,</hi> Mat. 16.16, 17, 18. This a second sign of a christians reall interest in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Signe</hi> 3. The third Signe of a Christians interest in Christ, is a ready obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all the commands of Christ; when I give you obedience, for a signe of being in Christ, I meane a filiall, and not a servile obedience; an obedience that is free, full, universall not compelled or in part; Iesus Christ loves not half Christians nor almost christians, Iesus Christ will be all Master or no Master: I am perswaded your selves think this a truth and no matter of dispute: The soule that hath truly given up it selfe to Iesus Christ, that trusts him with all,

Who I pray you would not change thus at any time? who would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly leave a poore rotten cottage, that will keepe out to wet or weather, for a goodly faire Pallace: alas! what hurt doth the wicked to the Saints by killing them? what hurt doth one doe to a poore pined prisoner, to knock off his bolts and set him at liberty? what hurt doth one when he finds a poore childe like to perish in the woods, to lead him out and bring him home to his Fathers house? this is all the hurt the enemies doth the Saints. The poore Soule is lockt and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the prison of the body, a Bullet sets it at liberty; the poor soule being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to perish in a wood of troubles and miseries, Death brings it to heaven and happinesse, to God and Christ, the Saints and glory.
