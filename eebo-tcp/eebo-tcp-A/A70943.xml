            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving perused certaine Questions concerning Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which carry your name Imprinted in the Frontice-piece:
The well-wishes which I bare towards you, did soone
prevaile with me to make an Answer to them, conceiving you
may cast an eye thereon as purposely directed to your selfe, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
Well-willer, rather than on sundry larger Discourses; which if
you had seriously considered, I cannot but imagine, you would have been
better informed, than, for the present, I perceive you to be in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular:</p>
            <p>The Title sayes, <hi>Considerable serious questions sadly propounded:</hi> And
the Preface tells the World. You have <hi>neither leasure, nor opportunity</hi> to
debate the late unhappy differences touching Church Government, &amp;c.
which moved you to <hi>digest</hi> your <hi>subitane apprehensions</hi> of these distracting
controversies <hi>into</hi> the ensuing <hi>considerable Questions,</hi> to be sadly ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and solidly debated by <hi>sober minded, peaceably disposed men,</hi> of <hi>greater
ability</hi> and <hi>vacancy</hi> for such a worke, &amp;c. Surely 'twill seem strange to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51165:2"/>
many, that <hi>subitane apprehensions</hi> should so easily be digested into <hi>consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
questions,</hi> by one who in his owne confession, had <hi>neither leasure, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
nor ability for the worke;</hi> and yet it will likely be thought more
wonderfull that you seem to thinke so lightly concerning the distractions
of the Churches, (from whence not a few of no little piety and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
conceive the distractions of the Kingdome to arise) as to imagine
the publishing of <hi>subitane apprehensions,</hi> should in any considerable degree
conduce to a composing of them.</p>
            <p>1. To the first Question then I answer: That the <hi>Gospel being by
Christs owne injunction to be preached to all Nations,</hi> Matth. 28. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20. &amp;c.
<hi>(who have their established different formes of Civill government) Christ hath
not peremptorily prescribed one, and the selfe same forme of Ecclesiasticall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
Discipline and Rites unto all Nations:</hi> (the more to blame are
such as go about to prescribe one throughout whole Kingdomes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world) and that <hi>every severall Nation, Republique,</hi> yea and every
particular Christian <hi>ought to have under the Gospel a liberty and latitude, to
choose such a forme of Church government,</hi> as he himselfe, for his particular
use, in his owne reason and understanding apprehendeth to be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Gods Word, and not runne on implicitely, subjecting himselfe
to whatsoever shall be projected or set up by others, whereof he himself
<hi>doubting, incurres damnation,</hi> Rom. 14. 22, 23. But for the Articles and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> you know they are for Episcopacie, and were
once as strong for Popery, never for Presbytery: but what if they
should be for Popery againe, Judaisme or Turcisme? 'tis no offence to
make a querie, nor impossible to come to passe: the greatest part of such
as choose our Parliament men are thought to be Popishly or Malignantly
affected, and if it ever happen so, by the same Law and Doctrine the
whole Kingdomes must in consequence, and such obedience as you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate,
conforme themselves to Popery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judaisme or Turcisme: But you
will meane the State may impose no other government but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to the Word of God? I answer: That the Papists, Jewes and
Turkes, doe all affirme that both their discipline and doctrine are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Word of God, and their yea is full as good as your no: If
then you say we must suffer rather th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n submit unto such Antichristians;
you say well: but withall, I answer, that you agree with them or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them (even whilst they persecute you) in theirs or your principles
(for both have one and the selfe same) of persecution: and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in all Church governments, Discipline and Ceremonies are
left to humane prudence; the Magistrate may not impose ought upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51165:2"/>
the Subjects in generall, or upon any one in particular, which by them
or him cannot be assented to, or performed with <hi>a good conscience both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God and men,</hi> Act, 24. 16.</p>
            <p>But since you take notice of Christs injunction for <hi>preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to all Nations,</hi> Matth. 28. 19. let it not seem strange if <hi>I affirme it to be
impossible for man to propound a rationall way, or so much as a possibility of
preaching the Gospel unto all Nations,</hi> without Liberty of Conscience, or in
any other than an Independent way: for how can you imagine that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
or Unbeleevers will come and live amongst you, that they may
be wonne unto the Gospel by your conversation, or by your convincing
them from evidence of Scripture, if they know your manner is to ravish
their Religion from them before their judgements be fully informed and
satisfied? or what hopes have you that erronious or misbeleeving States
and Princes will suffer such to lurke within their territories under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of propagating the Gospel in simplicity and truth, who hold opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
(too much savouring of Popery) that when they have converted
a sufficient party unto their beliefe, they may therewith under pretext
of pulling downe Idolatry and superstition, divest them of their power
and Country, unlesse they will forgoe their Religion, from which only
(how erronious soever) they expect salvation?</p>
            <p>Suppose a Turke desirous to turne Christian; the Calvinist, Lutheran,
Papist, Brownist and Anabaptist seeking to make him a Proselite to their
faith, each of them produce their grounds and reasons from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as the rule and guide to warrant and direct them in this Christian
warfare: Suppose againe, that these severall sorts of Christians may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
about the sense of Scripture, nay about the translation or originall
Text it selfe; how must this Turke be directed which of them to yeeld
unto, or be swayed withall? must it be to them that have the sharpest
sword or buffit him the most? doubtlesse he must not respect the numbers
or persons of the men, nor yet be led away by the opinions of either
which may be more complying with his lust, so are the yea and nay of
one or other of them all alike: 'Tis true, the Papists pretend miracles to
confirme their doctrine with, and I have heard the truth and reality
thereof affirmed by many travellers, whereof some have passed for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Gentlemen; but though I conceive my selfe to have been as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous,
and to have had greater opportunity than many others, as having
lived much amongst them, to have been a witnesse of them (if possible)
at some time or other, yet could I never attaine so neare as to conceive
the least likelyhood thereof; and yet if the Papists could, and did make
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51165:3"/>
use of false miracles, how may they be knowne from true ones? the
very Divels are reported to be subject and subordinate amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
according whereunto they submit unto, or vanquish one another;
and we know the Aegyptian Sorcerers went very farre in competition
with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> so that we must not be swayed with miracles
neither, little more than with the bare yea and nay of men, untill we see
an evident demonstration, an infallible guide, the very finger of God
himselfe in the gifts of the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. 5. who requires of us
no other than a reasonable service, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. and will in likelihood at
the great day of judgement condemne more for believing false Gospels
without just grounds, than for rejecting of the true Gospel, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it was accompanied with such signes and wonders as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
done before, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 24. As in naturall things, we beleeve nothing
but what we see a naturall reason for; so in supernaturall things, lesse
than a supernaturall evidence will not suffice: But how then must this
Turke be guided and directed to whom he should yeeld himselfe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert?
Surely I know no guide he has besides the reason which God
has given him: no thing in the whole creation is to beare such sway
with us as reason: but what should then induce this Turkes reason to
beleeve the one rather than the other, concerning the revelation of
Gods Will unto the World by the publication of the Law and Gospel?
whether any, or which of their translations is the truest? with the
most orthodox interpretation of any or every portion of the Scriptures?
and in summe, which is the right or truest Religion of them all? And
since they all alike pretend authority of Scripture with no lesse confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
than the Jews, who ceased not to cry, The Temple of the Lord, The
Temple of the Lord, even whilest they were deepest engaged to their
sinnes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4. I querie what may be the infallible unerring rule to lead
this Turke unto the true Religion? what it was in the beginning? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be still the same? whether lesse then infallible be a good guide
herein? whether rectified reason be not an infallible guide? how came
reason to be offuscated and depraved? how may we know when it is
vitiated? how recover it and keep it so? And if upon serious disquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the truth, we be found involved over head and eares in ignorance
and errour, no small portion of pretended knowledge to be bare opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
only, and the greatest part of most religions Antichristian void of
reason: how ought such as goe about to fasten a yoake of their owne
doctrine and opinions on others, be accounted the most ignorant, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
presumptuous, and the greatest enemies both to God and man of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51165:3"/>
any people under heaven, deserving death more then a murderer or trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor?
besides, it will easily appeare upon due scrutiny, That the compelling
men to a uniformity by Civill Powers, the enforcing of a Nationall
Church, the exacting obedience to whatsoever Religion shall be establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by Law, and consequently to change so often as the Politick Civill
State shall finde requisite for worldly ends, is the only way to banish all
Religion from their hearts, and breed in men a doubting of the Scriptures,
if not of God himselfe.</p>
            <p>If true Beleevers having got the upper hand may banish Misbeleevers,
for feare of being tainted with their errours; than ought not the true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
when they are few in number (suppose them Protestant Merchants
or others in Turkish or Popish Countries) by any means remain among the
misbeleevers, but forthwith to depart their territories, which the Apostles
and Primitive Christians did not practise? nay the contrary is insinuated,
whilest <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted, the Jews turned Christians to have their conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
honest amongst the Gentiles, that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which spake evill of them as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
doers, might by their good works which they should see, glorifie God in
the day of visitation, 1 <hi>Pet. 2 12. Pauls</hi> advice likewise was, That the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
husband should not put away the unbeleeving wife in hopes of
her conversion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 12. 16. And <hi>Peter</hi> bids wives be subject to unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
husbands for the same reason, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. 2. And since the power of
miracles through want of saith is ceased, we have no meanes so efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for convincing people of their errours, and bringing them unto the
truth as a godly conversation, the benefit and fruit whereof would be quite
frustrated, if the Saints of God being the greater party were either to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the misse or unbeleevers, or to withdraw themselves if they were
fewer: I desire this argument may be well reflected on, which though it
be briefe, and not enforced, I conceive it very pat and apposite unto the
point in controversie.</p>
            <p>I know the permitting men of so many different opinions in a Country,
is usually objected as a Bug-bear of all confusion, and disturber of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
State: (but to wave the experience of the contrary truth which we
see in Holland, Germany, France, Poland, Hungarie, Turky, Barbarie,
and elsewhere) why may they not as well live as peaceably and civilly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one Prince or State, as under different neighbouring or remoter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
betwixt whom, <hi>viz.</hi> Christians and Turkes, Protestants and Papists,
Lutherans and Calvinists, we see concluded and maintained peaceable
leagues and covenants, with a free egresse, regresse, or continuance of
the respective Subjects in one anothers territories? why should it breed
greater confusion, or discompose the Civill peace of England, by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51165:4"/>
an English Lutheran, Brownist, Antinomian, Anabaptist, Jew, Turk,
or others, more than if they were of any other Nation? or with what
sense or reason can that priviledge or freedome be denyed unto an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman
in his owne Countrey, because he differs from the State Religion
or opinions that be in fashion, which every forreigner of any Nation of
what profession soever in amity with England enjoyes without controle?
would it not be a pretty fancie to banish English Anabaptists, or others
dissenting in opinion from their native inheritance, their friends and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods,
whilest all our Ports, Townes, and houses are open to receive
Spanish Papists, and Dutch Anabaptists to take the bread out of our
mouths? I only make a querie of it that better judgements may reflect
thereon.</p>
            <p>2. Particular Churches, members of a Kingdome and Nation are not
obliged in point of conscience and Christianity, to submit unto whatsoever
publique Church Government, Rites and Discipline a Nationall Councel,
Synod and Parliament shall conceive most consonant to Gods Word, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it prove so in the whole Kingdomes, Nations, and those very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Churches judgement; for by the contrary position, they and Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi>
himselfe should be subject unto the Popish or Episcopall government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if this present Parliament and Synod doe but say the word; and the
Scriptures you aime to prove it with, doe not only faile, but make against
you, <hi>viz. 1 Cor.</hi> 32. 33. which text makes the whole Church, or rather every
member thereof capable of prophesying all alike; and I finde not but the
Spirits of the Prophets which the Apostle insinuates to be subject, might
possibly be of as wise, learned and noble as any the Christian world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded,
in that he said, <hi>Ye may all prophesie one by one,</hi> v. 31. and whether it
be not greater confusion in the sight of God to compell a hundred men of
twenty severall opinions to joyne in one imposed worship, than permit
each of them to serve God after his owne manner; and a kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
God to curse the true worshippers for the false worshippers sake,
or whether he will or not to blesse the false worshippers for the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
which are amongst them: And lastly, whether way is most peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
to desire only a Christian liberty for our selves of serving God in such
manner as we finde ourselves bound in conscience to doe, or the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a prescript way, our owne, a humane ordinance upon others, who
neither understand it to be reasonable or godly; let man see and judge as
God doth in judgement and in truth.</p>
            <p>As touching your texts for <hi>Subjection to the Powers, viz.</hi> Rom. 13. 1. 2.
1 Pet. 2. 13. 14. 15. We must bate them in this case, or be subject to Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie,
which I would be loath to be, though it boast of Statute Law as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51165:4"/>
yet: And for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 32, 33. deale equally with me: can you conceive
that you give me lesse offence in forcing me to joyne with you in such a
way of worship as I thinke sinfull or lesse pleasing unto God, than I should
give unto you by peaceably serving God after another manner, only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from yours, without so much as maligning yours, much lesse compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of your person? or doe you any way seeke my profit that I might
be saved, when you force me to serve God (as you alleadge) after such a
manner whereof I doubt, and so am damned? <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 22, 23.</p>
            <p>3. and 4. To the third and fourth Question, I answer: That in all the
New Testament you finde no Nationall Churches, but severall Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ones, to wit, so many Churches as you read of in all the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
no one depending on the other: But for Presbyteriall government,
I finde there no print thereof, far better colour for Episcopacie; yet lest
Episcopacie should attempt to shew her hornes againe, I propound it as
a querie; whether superiority, or Episcopall preheminence, which the
Apostles enjoyed in those dayes, was not only by reason of the immediate
Call, Commission, and a higher measure of inspiration which they enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above their brethren? and that since neither Bishops, Synods, nor
Classicall Presbyteries can now boast more of the Holy Ghost than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
whether Presbyters should not be contented to become levell
with their brethren, or restore againe the superiority to Bishops, unto the
Apostles and their successours.</p>
            <p>The unity, peace and amity which you insinuate to be established by
Presbyteriall Government, is it otherwise than of the outward man? can
you compell them into an unity of hearts and mindes as well as bodies?
was a coercive power ever sanctified for such a purpose? had a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
government of Churches, or a Nationall Church been so beautifull in
the eyes of Christ, doe we not thinke the Apostles and Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
would have been as wise to finde it out, and as daring to practise it as
were the Papists of England, who alwayes governed themselves by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
their Bishop of Chalcedon being continually resident in the Land
till within these tenne yeares? which yet caused such a difference betwixt
the Jesuits and the secular Priests, as that they have been impleading one
another at the Court of Rome for above these twenty yeares: Methinkes
you should have knowne of this, and not presuppose the Apostles and
Primitive Christians inferiour to Papists for piety or discipline.</p>
            <p>But as for the capacity you say this Government hath to prevent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
errours, faction, libertinisme, injustice, and other inconveniences: I
appeal to the throne of reason (since that of Christ Jesus being spirituall is
so little apprehended by the carnally minded) whether the quite contrary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51165:5"/>
be not the truth it selfe out of this consideration only, <hi>viz.</hi> The Nationall
Church government to be afterwards established, must first be made choice
of by most voices, and so imposed upon the rest for Evangelicall; the most
are most commonly the most corrupt, most licentious, most injust, most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious,
either quite carelesse or regardlesse of every Religion of all devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and by their Club-law which they are able to manage, being the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
party, they will both erect their government, and compell others to be
like themselves; and I desire to propound it to your saddest thoughts to be
seriously considered on, whether such as are so earnest that the State
should prescribe them what Religion to be of, and after what manner to
worship God, doe not so for the most part out of idlenesse, because they
themselves will not take paines to try the Spirits, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1. whether they
be not meer formalists, and such as may be thought to be of opinion, and
passe their lives, as though the State must give account both of their faith
and workes at the day of judgement, and not they themselves.</p>
            <p>As I told you before, I finde no Nationall Church in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but severall Independent ones, which I intreat you to consider on:
If you say there was no whole Nation converted to the Christian Faith in
those dayes, and that the Christians wanted Civill power; I answer, That
there were so many Proselites, so many converted as made severall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if not in one City, in one Province at least, and within a few (some
12) miles one of another, to wit, the 7 Churches of Asia, no two whereof,
besides the first Christian Antioch and others, were above 120 miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and yet all these were Independent, as appears by the respective di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
and the distinct charges which the Blessed Spirit in the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pronounced against them: and whether the Civill powers were then
Christian or Antichristian, had the dependencie and subordination of
Churches been an Ordinance of God, good Christians would have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
without a Civill power to pillory or whip them to it, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
not omitted to reprehend them if they had done amisse in not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it: Since then a Classicall Presbyteriall government has no president
in the New Testament, and Episcopall which domineer'd in some degree,
almost ever since has been voted Antichristian, and neither of them by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive
meanes can worke more upon Christians than they can upon so
many head of Cattle by impounding them in what place they please, no
one of them may warrantably be established.</p>
            <p>5. As the grounds of Independent government attribute nothing to the
Magistrate in Church affaires farther then the Magistrate is a member of
their Churches and Assemblies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so no people under heaven ascribe more
unto the Magistrate than the Independent doe in Civill matters. The
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51165:5"/>
Great Turke is not so absolute a Monarch, as a Prince, a Magistrate may be
over a people independent in matters of Religion, who being such as
make a conscience of all they do, would not only give unto <hi>Caesar</hi> the
things that be <hi>Caesars,</hi> but even suffer their own, their propriety in part to be
taken from them, rather then resist the Powers, so they may quietly enjoy
the Liberty of their Consciences; the Scriptures, the principles on which
they ground themselves, doe necessarily inforce them to it.</p>
            <p>6. Doubtlesse in all Nations from the first preaching of the Gospel till
now, Christians did multiply, and particular Churches likewise, which for
the most part had dependencie on, and communion one with another, and
were all subordinate to Nationall and Provinciall Synods, and publique
Ecclesiasticall constitutions; but such Churches as were chiefly Papall or
Episcopall, and never Presbyteriall till within the memory of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
and why we may not retreat backe againe into the errours of a
hundred yeares, as well as not passe forward unto a farther measure of
light and knowledge, I finde little satisfaction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>7. The selfe same Law of Nature, God, and rectified reason which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
and warranted all Nations to subject themselves unto some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
forme of Civill government, obliging all persons and societies of
men alike, which they conceived most advantagious, doth not warrant us
to doe the like in Church affaires; because whatsoever civill action the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Magistrate requires, may be performed by the outward man, or else be
expiated by penalty without taint of conscience: But the Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as it aimes at, and regards the Spirituall service and performance,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. so the punishments must have a Spirituall effect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18. and
cannot be undergone, or worke upon a mans spirit unlesse he will himself,
neither may he be willing thereunto, unlesse he apprehend them to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Christs Government and Institution.</p>
            <p>8. From <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 17. and 34. 23, 24. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 34 23, 24. and <hi>Deut.
16. 16. Levit.</hi> 17. 3. 4. 8 9 which speakes of the Nationall Church of the
Jewes appearing at Ierusalem thrice a yeare, you can no fitter apply it to
prove a Nationall Church of Christians, than make it possible for all the
world if they were Christians (which in such a sense must be Nationall) to
appeare thrice a year at Ierusalem, or excuse them if they did not appear:
and if you grant a Catholicke Church throughout the world which may
reach from one end thereof even to the other: I wonder how it can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
that such as joyn in an Independent Church way may not as possibly
be accounted and prove true members of the Catholicke: but for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Synagogues and Parochiall Assemblies, as you call them, of the Iews,
to which the people living together in a City were alotted and restrained,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51165:6"/>
I finde no ground in Scripture; but strong evidence for a kinde of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Churches amongst the very Jewsd, as you may gather from <hi>Deutt.
12. 12. 18. c. 16. 11. 14. c. 26. 11. 12. Judg.</hi> 17. 18. Chapters, by such of them
as kept Levites to officiate in their families.</p>
            <p>The Synodall Assembly you point at in the <hi>Acts</hi> 15. was no formall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
neither would you as I conceive be contented to be bound by such an
other, to wit, by a particular Church (that is a Parish Church in your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
if you hold any such in those dayes) of another place, whereof you
your selfe are no member: If you say an assembly of brethren at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
or any other particular place would now want inspired Apostles to
make them Synodall, or their Decrees of binding power, I cannot help you
till it please God to send us others; neither doe I finde it in the power of
man, because they have not an Apostolicall spirit to supply the want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by numbers, by multiplying or assembling so many more Presbyters or
Presbyteries, all men subject to the same passions with our selves, <hi>Act. 14.
15.</hi> which is such a peece of simonie as we must be driven to grant, that
God Almighty hath hertofore infatuated such inventions, or yeeld the
Papists therein the upper hand.</p>
            <p>But where doe we finde that those of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> sent binding decrees to
the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> I see it not in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 22. to 32. <hi>c.</hi> 16. 14.
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 21. 25. which you produced for that purpose; since whatsoever their
decrees were, though they were infallibly assisted by the presence of the
Holy Ghost, <hi>v.</hi> 28. the penalty thereof was no more, than, <hi>If you doe observe
these things you shall doe well,</hi> v. 29. In Gods name then, if you will needs
have Synods, and equalize them with the Apostles in making of decrees,
which I feare mee, may amount unto presumption, let them at least
binde no otherwise than the Apostles, than these of Jerusalem, to
wit Spiritually; give them no sting or poison of Civill power, which
will subtilly undermine, enervate, and quite eat out the spirituall, other
than which, you will (and may well for this very cause) acknowledge the
Apostles neither had nor exercised: But what are these binding decrees
of that Synodall Assembly? are they any other than a small portion, or
Historicall narration of the Acts of the Apostles? did they then binde the
Churches of the Gentiles, or all Christians since, any otherwise than other
portions of Scripture doe? And <hi>if you will have Synods and Parliaments to
make the like binding decrees at present, doe you not say by consequence, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that they may prescribe us another Gospel, other Scriptures?</hi> which though
they were not differing, but alike to what we have received, are we not
forbid to adde unto them upon perill of damnation? <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>But for the Churches of <hi>England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. recorded
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51165:6"/>
by Historians and Canons, I feare me, if well examined, they will rather
be found <hi>Church walls,</hi> than Church Assemblies, <hi>living Temples</hi> of the Lord,
whereof <hi>Christ Jesus is the corner stone,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 16, 17. Eph. 2. 20, 21, 22.
such stocks and stones have the lazie, covetous, aspiring, and which is
worst of all, persecuting (lergie-men endeavoured to bring poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to, the laity as they call them, that they might afterwards hew and
hammer them into whatsoever else their owne lusts most desired.</p>
            <p>9. In my answer to your 3. and 4. Questions, I hope to have given
you, if you consider of it, some satisfaction, that even in the Apostles times,
the Christians if they had been inspired thereto, or so desired, might have
made themselves a Nationall Church, what ever the Civill Magistrate had
beene, as well as Papists in England, who alwayes were and still are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to their Bishop in chiefe, from whom they have appeale to Rome; or
the Jewes themselves, which so long as they were a Church, were still a
Nationall Church, though subjected to heathen Princes as touching Civill
matters, in captivity and strictest bondage: For suppose <hi>England</hi> ought to
be, and were a Nationall Church of Calvinists, or other kinde of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants;
if the Prince thinke, good to alter his owne Religion, or some
party of the Subjects, a fourth, fift or so; does the Kingdome cease to be a
Nationall Church? if it do not, let the Kingdome enjoy their Nationall
Church, and particulars, such as will, their Independent way; but if it do,
it is a strong argument that the erecting of Nationall Churches is no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God, as being over liable to casualty and subversion, if the
Prince thereof only, or every lesser part has a capacity to overthrow it.</p>
            <p>But whereas you say, that as the Christians multiplyed, so were Church
Officers, and their Church Government and Discipline varied, the Church
Officers encreased, &amp; <hi>new Gospels</hi> written, prescribing new necessary rules,
canons and directions, &amp;c. and transmitting the same liberty unto posterity
of supplying and instituting the like as they themselves should afterwards
finde requisite: the phrase, or rather doctrine of <hi>new Gospels</hi> stumbles me
not a little, conceiving we finde it <hi>branded with a curse,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. 9. 1 Tim. 1.
3. and I feare me, you may as well question whether we have that true
Gospel which was once delivered to the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. as multiply or
coine us new ones, for if there be more then one, or since all Christians are
endowed with Christian liberty all alike; if a Lutheran, Calvinist, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist
or Brownist; if a Papall Presbyteriall or other Synod; if Rome,
Spaine, France or England may make new Gospels, all other States, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
and People of what opinion soever may doe the like; and then what
spirit lesse than wonderfull and infallible can assure us which is the true
one? and yet such as will make new Rites and Ordinances (their very
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51165:7"/>
Ceremonies becomming Ordinances by their enjoyning them) to binde
the consciences of their brethren, must necessarily derive their warrant
from some new and unknowne Gospel, or have no new ones, their owne
confession implying no lesse, in that they hold a necessity of new Rites
and Ceremonies, whereof they acknowledge to have no expresse warrant
for them in the Scriptures which are common to us: and for the liberty
you say Independents use in this respect, they impose it no otherwise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any, but that every particular man which apprehends it not to be Gods
way, may peaceably withdraw himselfe.</p>
            <p>But for <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 1. to 5. <hi>Zach.</hi> 8 22. and <hi>Es. 2. 2. 3. And it shall come to
passe in the last dayes that the mountaine of the Lords house, shall be established in
the top of the mountaines, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all Nations
shall flow unto it. And people shall goe and say, come ye and let us goe up to the
mountaine of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his
waies, and will walke in his paths, for out of Zion shall goe forth the law, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem;</hi> which you bring to prove the Prophets
prediction of Nationall conversions, and consequently of Nationall
Churches after their dayes; but you can no more justifie a Nationall
Church of Christians from thence, than that the same Nationall Church
of Christians shall likewise goe up to the Temple of Jerusalem, from
whence by the same Prophesie they are also to receive the Word of God,
and not from Parliament, Pope, Synod or Presbytery: nay the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
goes futher, and sayes, That <hi>they shall then breake their swords into
mattocks, and their speares into sithes; Nation shall not rise up against Nation,
neither shall they learne to sight any more,</hi> v. 4. May then a Presbyterial Spirit
carve or mince this Prophesie out unto us by peece-meales which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the most High hath joyned? and if it be to be verified of our times,
that Nation shall not lift up sword against Nation, neither shall they learn
to fight any more; must not these sonnes of thunder, these men of Warre,
these Church Incendiaries, which doe little besides preaching fire and
sword, with incensing of their over credulous disciples to drive out of the
Country, out of the World, or persecute even unto death such as only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from them in opinion; must they not I say condemne themselves?
this course may make a People become a Nation of Divels, or sooner cut
a whole Nation off, than make them grow into a Nationall Church to
serve the Lord in sincerity and truth: But what if whole Nations should
be converted? if Nationall conversions may or ought to prove so many
Nationall Churches, suppose <hi>English, Scotch, Dutch, French,</hi> whereof no
one will submit unto the other, though they were all orthodox Protestants,
would not they be all independent in respect to one another? why then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51165:7"/>
may it not be tolerable in the eyes of God, for as many lesser Churches or
Congregationall Assemblies in one State or Kingdome to enjoy a like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependencie?
is God a respecter of numbers or of Nations? but if the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Nations so converted ought to make but one Nationall Church, why
may not the proselites of all Countries as well make one Nationall Church,
since we find in <hi>Zach</hi> 14. 16. whilest he prophesieth of a Nationall Church
and worship, that every one that is left of all the Nations which came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Jerusalem shall goe up from yeare to yeare to worship? and which
of them shall have the honour of the denomination and christning of it?
wherefore should it be called after one, rather than after any other of
them? I feare me, the Gossips will not agree about the name, especially the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> who have the <hi>Catholicke</hi> King, and thinke all Nations of the
World bound to leave their owne, and learne their fashions, language, and
what not: and yet the Jewes will tugge hard for it, both with Rome, the
Spaniard, and all others, pretending that all Prophesies and other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which doe make for a Nationall Church, declare it plainly to be Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish,
<hi>Es. 49. c. Mic.</hi> 4 1. 5. and the truth is, that under the Law, whoever
of the Nations were then converted, were properly said to be of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish
Church in whatsoever climate or Country they were resident; but
how an English-man can be a member of severall Nationall Churches at
once (as he may happen in his life time to have lived severall yeares in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Countries) or be one yeare a member of one Nationall Church, and
another yeare of another, I know not but conceive it to be totally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent,
and yet you will make him be a member of the Nationall Church
where ever he resides for the present, and that if the Church be now Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
whosoever is once a member, can no more cease to be a member
(by leaving one Nationall Church and joyning to another) than in time
of the <hi>Jews</hi> when there were but two estates, to wit, within or without the
Iewish Church.</p>
            <p>But if severall Nationall Churches may make up one Catholique, why
may not so many more Independent Churches doe so too? And if all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
must now make but one Nationall Christian Church, must it not
insinute one High Priest, one Pope to be head thereof that it may the
better hold parallel with the <hi>Jewish?</hi> If well examined 'tis not unlikely
something equavalent thereunto may be discovered: will not these
changelings like <hi>Micha's</hi> vagabond Priests which remove from one Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
Living, and Lecture to another as often as a more plentifull is proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
thinke it better to officiate to a Tribe and Nation, than to a petty as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
or family, and so betray their flocks? <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 18,
19, 20. Is it not to be feared that men cry out for a subordination of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51165:8"/>
or Presbyteries to inlarge their owne jurisdiction? and will not the
same <hi>mercuriall</hi> spirits at times and opportunities refine the businesse, and
discover when a Papall <hi>plenipotentia</hi> may best conduce to unity, and that
with good reason too according to their carnall principles? for why
should not a Monarchicall Government be as lawfull in Church as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
if the insinuated argument in your seventh Question be good,
it should be necessary so far forth, as many judicious Writers hold a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall
Government to be most exquisite and perfect for every Civill
State? nay why should it not be so? or how dare the favourers, abetters
of a Nationall Christian Church endure any other than a Monarchicall
head and government, such a one as God himselfe prescribed unto the
Jews, and fully as much (even both at once or not at all, I meane a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall
head to the Nationall Christian Church) as he did a Nationall
Church unto the Christians?</p>
            <p>10. It will be no more obstinacie, singularity, arrogancie, selfe-ends,
nor peremptory schisme for Independents to submit unto a government
established by consent of Parliament, and Synod hereafter, than it would
have been heretofore, if the said government shall require any thing of
them which they cannot yeeld unto without defiling of their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
you will, I presume, grant they might doe so in time of Popery or
Episcopacie; and why a Presbytery should have a liberty of forcing men
to sinne against their owne faith; of doing evill, and exercising domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over the consciences of their brethren, which neither the Pope nor
Bishops might, is to me a riddle.</p>
            <p>But I conceive I may safely bring my appeale home to Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> owne
conscience, and aske him seriously why he might not have made his tenth
whole Querie unto himselfe when he opposed the whole Church and
State of England, not having then so many to side with him therein, as
through Gods goodnesse the Independents now have hundreds? Oh! how
doe you give offence unto your brethren, and cause to thinke you then
stood out upon a wrong foundation, in that you doe not see the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
have the same, and so much better? nay doe you not justifie the
Archbishop in all his harsh proceedings then against you, whom now
you yet prosecute, for what he did then, the very same which you, if you
had power, would doe to Independents? reconcile but your selfe unto
your selfe, and i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> I mistake not, you will be far nearer composing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting
controversies you speake of in your Preface, whereof your 12
bloudy Queries, with doctrines and spirits of the same alay are the only
causers.</p>
            <p>But good now, tell me, were they Statesmen, Bishops, a Star-chamber
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51165:8"/>
or High-Commission Court, whose government when time was you so
withstood? what if a Presbyteriall Discipline seem as unwarrantable and
ungodly unto a thousand Christians who you call Independents, and in the
opinion of understanding and pious men may likely be as conscientious
and knowing as your selfe? but what if you a single man or so, were then
in the right, though you withstood the setled government of a State or
Nationall Church, and a thousand Independents now in an errour for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
their opinions concerning Presbyteriall government which is but
getting into the Throne, not yet established, were in the wrong? what
infallible rule or spirit did you then discover unto the State whereby they
might be prevailed upon to thinke you then were in the right, which a
thousand Independents may not rather be thought to have now, done
the like and more, though yet they were in the wrong? if then we be all
subject to the same passions and infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15. let us use instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
and admonishing with meeknesse, bearing one anothers burthen,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Pet. 5. 2. Peter</hi> exhorts the Elders to <hi>take the oversight of the flocke of
God amongst them, not by constrains but willingly:</hi> Perhaps some may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the sense of these words <hi>constraint</hi> and <hi>willingly</hi> to be doubtfull, to
wit, whether of the two be to be understood actively in reference to the
Elders, and whether of them passively; in which respect the better to
finde out the Apostles meaning, it may not be amisse to try both wayes,
whereby I doubt not but we shall easily make appear which of them doth
best agree with the coherence as well of that which does precede, as of
that which followes. If the word constraint be to be understood passively
in relation to the Elders, then the meaning of the words, as I suppose, can
be no otherwise then this: <hi>I exhort you Elders to be forward in taking wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
the oversight of Gods flocke, not delaying so long as that the flocke compell
you thereunto;</hi> and if it signifie actively, then will it amount to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
<hi>I exhort you Elders to take the oversight of the flocke of God so far forth
only as they are willing to be subject unto your oversight without constraint:</hi> If
then we examine which of these two interpretations of the Apostles
word will suit best with the context, we shall finde the former not only
like a patch of old cloath in a new garment, but if we will make it to bee
sense, we must suppose the flocke of God might constraine the Elders to
take the oversight, if of themselves they were unwilling, which I suppose
you will explode: But that the intention of the Apostle was to exhort the
Elders to take the oversight, and rule over the flocke of God so farre forth
only as the flocke was willing, is cleare by the following words, <hi>v.</hi> 3.
where he addes, that they should <hi>not take the oversight as Lords over Gods
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51165:9"/>
heritage, but being ensamples to the flocke;</hi> as if he should say, Though the
flocke of God have willingly, and of their owne accord chosen you to
have the oversight and rule over them in the Lord, yet thinke not that
you have hereby obtained any lordly power or dominion over Gods he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage,
but that you might only serve as more eminent ensamples of well-doing
unto the flocke: but if they might have taken the oversight by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
to wit, whether the flocke would or no; then must they necessarily
in that respect have been as Lords over Gods heritage, which the Apostle
expressely prohibits them.</p>
            <p>If then the Elders, Presbyters and Bishops may not take this oversight
of the flocke of God, farther then the flocke doth willingly consent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
how will your Parish Churches, much lesse your Nationall endure this
Scripture? how can you longer uphold either of them, or they subsist, so
long as you beleeve and yeeld obedience to it? unlesse you will say the
greater part which are willing, will sufficiently constitute a Parochiall
or Nationall Church, and this the Independents will not grudge you,
much lesse abridge you of, so long as you are contented to expect, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Apostles long suffering, <hi>Eph. 4. 2, 3, 4. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 2. till they can
be convinced to joyne with you therein.</p>
            <p>What thinke you is the reason that the Kings and Parliaments Forces
have been kept thus in a ballance destroying one another, whilest it may
have been observed for the most part, that when either side was in best
condition and height of glorying expecting a totall victory, as I may say,
the next encounter proved their overthrow; but that the design of most
voices on both sides, is to get power to persecute the other for cause of
conscience? We may be confident that if both sides had not only notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
but even equally offended God in highest measure through a desire
of power to persecute their brethren meerly for differing in opinion, God
would have put an end unto the common miseries in giving victory to
one of them; but alas! let it be no offence to say, his infinite Wisdome
findes neither of them capable of such mercie whilest they are so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
to one another: is it not too too evident that both the Episcopall and
Presbyteriall Clergie contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi> profession, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. aspire at
rule and dominion over the faith of others, Gods most conscientious and
dearest servants? are not their Assemblies full of these alarmes? are not the
Pulpit cushions worne out with tragicall actions suitable thereunto? are
not these the comfortable doctrines the disconsolate people are forced to
feed upon in these miserable distractions, whilest they kill one another in
the field, or so many grow mad at home, and dye of penury and despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
and what thinke we made our brethren the Scotch so successeles
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51165:9"/>
here in England, whilest the Warres are now beginning to kindle in their
owne Country, if it were not that they joyne with this Nation, or rather
provoke to establish their so much Idolized Presbyteriall Discipline
of persecution? when yet they themselves thought they had just cause to
be highly offended with the same (their owne) persecuting spirit in Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie.
When the Lord required the Israelites to appeare before him at
Jerusalem thrice a yeare, he promised that <hi>no man should invade their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in their absence,</hi> Exod. 34. 23, 24. which gracious providence of his
no doubt continues still protecting all such as are imployed by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
but unlesse our brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> bethinke themselves in time,
and consider that even as the persecuting Bishops of <hi>England</hi> attempting
to impose their government in <hi>Scotland</hi> gave occasion to begin the Wars
in <hi>England;</hi> so if the persecuting Presbyters of <hi>Scotland</hi> continue to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and get set up the <hi>Scotch</hi> government in <hi>England,</hi> it may likely
bring all three Kingdomes to make the seat of War in <hi>Scotland:</hi> I would
be loath to prophesie upon this occasion, but doe much feare, that in how
bad condition soever both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are at present, if the Wars
last but a little longer, <hi>Scotland</hi> will yet be in farre worse: God of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
mercy open the eyes of all three Kingdomes in this their heavy visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
reconciling Himselfe unto them all, and them to one another for
his deare Sonne <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> sake.</p>
            <p>11. The Independent Government will not so certainly let in heresies
into their Churches, as the setling of a coercive jurisdiction in or at the
Clergies becke would keep truth out from a Nationall Church; but if he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies
doe multiply without, in the world (in a Nationall Church) that is
no more than was foretold and must follow of necessity, <hi>Mat. 24. 24.
1 Cor.</hi> 11. 19. this concernes not the Independent Government which
permits no Heretickes to be amongst them within their Churches: they
make use of instructing, admonishing, reproving and rebuking, with such
other Spirituall meanes and armour, as are only proper and sanctified
by God Almighty for preventing heresies and schismes; whereas all other
Discipline which uses imprisoning, whipping, stigmatizing, and evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
even unto death, a course fitter to be practised towards beasts
than men, may make the outward man turne hypocrite, two fold worse
the childe of the Divell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 15. but never prevaile upon the Spirit,
which, such proceedings may easily exasperate and keep further off, but
will never win unto the truth.</p>
            <p>Men doe not imbrace errours otherwise than as they account them
truths, and therefore 'tis no marvell if they prove as pertinacious in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the one, as they are constant in defending of the other; in which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51165:10"/>
respect what ever mens opinions be, they must be dealt withall by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>meeknesse and long suffering,</hi> Gal 6. 1. 2 Tim. 4. 2. 5. Tit. 2. 15. 2 Thess. 3.
14. we know not Gods secret times and seasons for bringing men unto the
truth; 'tis a dangerous thing to anticipate Gods judgements, even on those
which afterwards were to be condemned; some are not called untill the
11 houre in Gods account; and our Saviour taught us to aske forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
no otherwise then we forgive our brethren, and no hereticke how
grosse soever, has greater need of a mercifull Presbytery, than that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
has of the Father of mercies.</p>
            <p>'Tis an easie matter to exclaime against <hi>Anabaptisticall, Antinomian,
Hereticall, Atheisticall opinions, as of the soules mortality, divorce pleasure,</hi>
&amp;c. but one dram of apposite Scripture, and rectified reason would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
men of their errours, far sooner then the clubs &amp; slaves which were
and are still imployed against our Saviour and his Saints when <hi>they could
not resist the Spirit and wisdome wherewith they spake,</hi> Act 6. 10. I can easily
beleeve that since this Parliament time of speaking and writing truth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
errours have thereby been published, but even you your selfe by this
meanes have not acquired a farther knowledge of some truth which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
might still in likelyhood have been witheld, I must either stand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at the transcendent perfection of your knowledge, or conceive you
have spent more time in writing then in reading.</p>
            <p>12. Independencie is not so like a <hi>Pharisaicall dangerous spirituall
pride, vain-glorious singularity, or selfe-conceitednesse of a mans owne superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
holinesse,</hi> as the Papall Episcopall, Presbyteriall, or other such like Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which is not contented to enjoy God and himselfe in peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
but what ever giddy whimsie, or phanaticke projects invade &amp; cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
his understanding, is restlesse, and <hi>Haman</hi> like, <hi>Est.</hi> 3. 5. 6. pines away
untill he have brought his neighbour, the Towne, Country, and all the
World to bow to him perforce, to be of his opinion.</p>
            <p>You your selfe in what you stood out against the Bishops or the State
were Independent, and like enough would then in modesty have beene
contented barely to have enjoyed your independencie, for what you
found your selfe not able to submit unto in conscience; and now that you
thinke you have gained an opportunity, doe you take it to be justice or
good doctrine to foment and be a ring-leader unto others towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and exercising dominion over the consciences of your brethren?
Oh the impartiality and falshood of a mans owne heart and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of this Parliament the whole Kingdome sided with
both Houses in the vindication of their Liberties, and so it continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51165:10"/>
such as did overmuch idolize Presbytery, prevailed for a Bill to damne
Episcopacie root and branch, that Presbytery might succeed it with its
<hi>fascibus &amp; fustibus,</hi> with its <hi>Pentifiealibus &amp; Synodalibus;</hi> nothing to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
which concerned either wealth or jurisdiction, only an Episcopall
tyranny to be exchanged for a Presbyteriall slavery; which, so soone as
the Court Clergie discovered, they quickly plotted a countermine, they
quickly prevailed to bring Armes into the Field for asserting the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Church Government and Discipline established by Law; and thus
betweene Episcopacie and Presbytery, between the covetous and aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
dominering Clergie-men of War on both sides, not only the Grand
Designe, the vindication of our just Liberties, through Gods just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is well neare blasted, which was so likely to be compassed by a u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall
union and concurrence without the least bloodshed, save of some
few notorious Delinquents, and in stead thereof by their severall and yet
joynt contrivances, like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Foxes, the depraved Clergie-men of
both sides have engaged all three Kingdomes in so violent and execrable
a Civill Warre to the destruction and sudden death of so many thousand
Christians, Protestants, as the whole Christian World in so short a time
had never felt the like. Can Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> deny but that the parties now in
Armes, at least the Grand Instruments, those principall Engines which
set all the wheeles a running till they are growne quite giddy, may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their subtle carriage of it, be justly denominated Episcopall
and Presbyteriall? have they not as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> saith, 11. 39. divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Kingdomes betwixt them at present, and as <hi>Esaiah</hi> tells us, 56. 11.
doe they not looke to their owne way only, whilest every one has his
chiefe aime <hi>at the gaine which comes from his quarter?</hi> nay, hath not each of
them designed to reduce all three Kingdomes totally to their command
and bondage hereafter? may not the Apostle <hi>James</hi> his reprehension bee
thought purposely directed to them? <hi>From whence come warres and fightings
among you? come they not hence even of our lusts? James 4 1. aut Caesar, aut
nullus,</hi> nothing will serve their turnes lesse than absolute conquest of the
Kingdome, of the whole man both soule and body; imprisonment and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
fire and sword to all alike, to Independents as well as to Papists,
though the Papists till they renounce some certaine tenets, can be true to
neither, but the Independents unto either, as well as the Apostles and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians were to the Antichristian Roman Emperours.</p>
            <p>Did <hi>Micah,</hi> to whom the Word of the Lord came, <hi>c.</hi> 1. 1. tell the Jews
how <hi>they hated the good, and loved the evill, that they plucked off the skin and
flesh from their bones; that they did eat the flesh of Gods people, and flay'd their skin
from off them, that they brake their bones and chopp'd them in peeces as for the pot,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51165:11"/>
and as flesh within the caldron: they build up Sion with bloud, and Jerusalem
with iniquity, the heads thereof judge for reward, the Priests teach for hire, and
the Prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they say is not the Lord amongst
us? Micah</hi> 4. 2. 3. 10. 11. and may it not now as truly, if not then Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
be said of too too many on both sides at present, that they seeke to
settle uniformity, and build up a Nationall Church in bloud and rapine?
did <hi>Micah</hi> then tell the Jewes, <hi>v.</hi> 11. That their Heads did judge for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and may it not now be said as truly, that neither widow nor father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
neither poore nor oppressed can tell whom to flye to for reliefe or
comfort? no Saint to helpe them within hearing; the Drummes and
Trumpets, with imminent necessities, are made excuses to continue the
whole Kingdomes in unsufferable miserie, except such as can make friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
by their unrighteous mammon which they have got with fishing in
these troubled waters, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 9. may it not now be said as justly, that the
Priests of both sides, the Episcopall and Presbyteriall Clergie do <hi>teach for
hire, and prophesie for money?</hi> doth not the same Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> say truly of
them, He that putteth not into their mouthes, they even prepare War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him? doe they not with the most prostitute Popelings cry out, <hi>No
penny, no Pater noster?</hi> Is not maintenance, maintenance, the burthen of
all their Parlour or Pulpit pastime? and why should they so sacrilegiously
set a price on that which is but supposititious, the phancie of their owne
braines, the reall truth whereof God required all true Disciples to give for
nothing? <hi>Mat 10 8. Es.</hi> 55. 1. 2. or why should people be forced to buy
the chaffer of these Clergie-merchants, rather than the wares or labour of
a Shoomaker or porter? would not such dealing be damned for an unjust
monopoly, which yet these encroachers practise without a patent, if any
but themselves should doe the like? nay why must we be forced to pay
these mercenary Clergie-men for such counterfeit service and ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which others will discharge better, aud that for nothing? is not this
the greatest infringing of the Subjects propriety which the Kingdome suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers?
I say not this to under value the Ministery of the Gospell, or to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
an ample and abundant maintenance to such as truly labour in
Gods Vineyard; but to exaggerate the heynousnesse of those that do not
only set, as they pretend, the inestimable treasure of the Gospell, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable
Word of God to sale as if it were an unholy thing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. but
as much as in them lyes, compell all people and Nations by fire and sword
to buy trash and trumpery in stead thereof, and that at what price they
themselves please: And lastly, as <hi>Micah</hi> pronounced a curse upon the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
for these iniquities of theirs, <hi>v.</hi> 12. so have we, instead of peace
and propriety, nothing remaining besides direfull Wars and barbarous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastations;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51165:11"/>
and instead of a Nationall Church, through Gods just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we see three Nations weltering in one anothers blood.</p>
            <p>If then we have thus fallen into these miseries, may we not by retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading
get cut againe? if Episcopacie and Presbytery have set the State
on fire through an ambitious desire of Empire, together with a pestilent
spirit of persecuting one another, may not the serving both alike reduce
us to quietnesse againe? they are these pretended Clergy-men that love to
be called the great Rabbies and Doctors, that affect the uppermost seats
at feasts and meetings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 6. 7. these thinke the Blessed Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from all the Saints, to be retreated and confined unto their breasts;
they will allow no body to Prophesie besides themselves, contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi>
testimony, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. in which respect the people being for the most
part bred up in invincible ignorance, or most erroniously both disciplined
and doctrinated, through all which they become plunged into such a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
and inextricable misery, who may and ought justly to be called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
account for it, but the whole Clergie of the Kingdome? a charge was
laid upon the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 3. 18. to instruct and warne the Jewes of
their wicked wayes, and if he failed therein, the punishment was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to himselfe; and since the Clergie in other cases as of separating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
like a tribe of <hi>Levi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> usurping tithes, &amp;c. appeale unto the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why
should not they with their scroules and catalogues of offences be tryed by
the Law, as <hi>Festus</hi> said to <hi>Paul</hi> when he sent him unto <hi>Caesar?</hi> Act. 25. 12.</p>
            <p>Consider a little, I intreat you, the case of one upon the high way go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quietly and soberly about his businesse; if another should quarrell with
him and say he goes the wrong way, he understands not his owne busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and so compell him with threats and violence to goe and doe as he
would have him; would not every traveller that beheld it, take this other
to be impertinent, proud, presumptuous and injurious? and yet thus doth
the world treat the despised Independents, the meekest of all Christians,
which our Saviour sent into the world like sheep in the middest of wolves,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 6. And as <hi>Paul</hi> then <hi>thought he ought to doe many things contrary to
the Name of Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> Act. 26. 9. Ioh. 16. 2. So <hi>most men thinke they
doe God good service</hi> in reviling, mocking, and persecuting the Independents
by all manner of wayes, and for no other cause but that they are more
scrupulous than most men seem ordinarily, in desiring to keep a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
both towards God and man.</p>
            <p>And whereas you say that Independency casts off the strongest bonds of
brotherly love and care, &amp;c. I beseech you consider a little better of their
wayes; Is it not <hi>Pauls</hi> golden rule and theirs, to <hi>give no offence neither to
the Jew, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 32. <hi>to walke in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51165:12"/>
wisdome towards them that are without?</hi> Col. 4. 5. Is it not a speciall and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
drist of theirs to winne even such as are without the word by their
lowly and pious conversation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. Nay, doe they not treat farre
more humanely and Christianly all such with whom, by reason of their
unbeleefe or errours they can have no Church fellowship, than Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
or any coercive Church government does those whom they would
compell by persecution to joyne with them in Church society? if they
put to death the bodies of their friends, and consequently damne their
soule, for they cause them to dye as obstinate persons as heretickes;
what exquisite and new invented torments conjured from below the pit
of hell have such in store to treat their enemies withall? or how doe they
follow <hi>Pauls</hi> injunction, who ordered the incestuous person to be procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against in such a manner only, as though the flesh were mortified or
destroyed, yet the spirit might be saved in the day of our Lord Iesus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 5. I have purposely insisted only upon the most materiall passages of your
Questions, fearing I should have proved over tedious if I had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
however for a further dilucidation and strengthning of what I
have already said, give me leave to adde a few lines more.</p>
            <p>If a Pope, State, or Synod may impose Articles of Faith, or forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
prescribe men how they shall understand the Scriptures, stint them
to discourse on certaine portions only, and how far forth from hence will
follow these severall grosse absurdities: 1. That it is superfluous for common
people to have or read the Bible, because they may not be knowne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
any part thereof farther than they are dispenced withall, and that
may be imparted to them in such respective Treatises approved of by the
Pope, State, or Synod. 2. That it is needlesse to try the Spirits, because
according to such constitutions, they may neither flye from them though
they discover them to be erronious, nor imbrace them if they be of God;
but must implicitly conforme to whatsoever is required of them. 3. That it
were no blessing for God to have given unto any man a more discerning
spirit than ordinarily, because though never so transcendently full of the
Holy Ghost, he must notwithstanding quench, renounce it, and submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Magisteriall decrees whether they be true or false. 4. If a Pope,
State or Synod will expect Spirituall obedience to their Decrees, they must
assume to them the Spirit of infallibility, something above the common
sphere of mankinde, otherwise they take too much upon them, and their
brethren will be apt to examine, question and judge them too when
they see cause; and from the opinion of their infallibility will follow,
that it should be needlesse for the Pope to take counsell of his Cardinalls;
the Statesmen to receive information from the Subjects whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51165:12"/>
and from whom they receive their authority in trust only; Synods
of any others, or for they themselves to study the points before hand or as
private men; but <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, the State-house or Convocation-house
would <hi>ipso facto</hi> inspire, and translate them with <hi>Saul</hi> amongst the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
what ever their condition had been before. 5. It would follow
that whosoever take upon them this infallibility of deciding controversies,
should never faile therein if their Civill power be strong enough to backe
them in it; because both Popes, States and Synods doe alike lay claime,
at least require the same obedience to whatsoever they decree, in defiance
of one another, defending themselves and doctrines more by Civill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
than either right or reason, it being the Sword, not the Scriptures or
reason, which decides the controversie between carnall and persecuting
people: And lastly, if fining, imprisoning, or any degree of persecuting,
or using of coercive meanes against such as differ from them in opinion
were lawfull in the true Church or people of God; the Papists or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Heretickes, because they take themselves to be the true Church, were
bound to use the same even against the Saints of God because they differ
from them; neither should it be any aggravation unto the Jewes at the
day of judgement for crucifying of our Saviour, and shedding so much
innocent bloud of Saints, which yet we finde to fall upon them heavily,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 35. if persecution for cause of Conscience, were lawfull in any
people; since in such case both Jewes, Papists and Protestants of any
sort which persecute might say; The true Church had leave to persecute,
we held our selves to be the true Church, and thought we had done God
service in killing such as differed from us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 2. the putting of
the Saints to death is but a consequence which necessarily followes the
doctrine of persecution for cause of Conscience, though never so erronious.</p>
            <p>I will not deny but Independents ought to take advice and be directed
by the wisdome, learning and piety of others who are better gifted than
themselves, neither may they doe any thing rashly contrary thereunto, but
rather suspend a while, still desiring farther light and information: yet
when it comes unto an issue, and that we must necessarily declare our
selves; we may not by any composition, or for any respect whatsoever be
finally overswayed by the wisdome, learning, and piety of others never
so eminently gifted, nor be prevailed upon to doe any thing against our
owne consciences and understanding.</p>

denying obedience thereunto, as we our selves thinke good, be not an absolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction?
and lastly, Whether they that attribute such a power to Parliaments
and Synods as they themselves will question and disobey, when they thinke good doe
not in effect weaken and quite enervate the power of Parliaments, or else condemn
themselves in censuring the Independents for witholding of obedience from Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Synod in such things wherein they never gave, or meant them to have
power?</p>
               <p>If the whole Kingdome may deny obedience unto Popish Acts and Canons, or
upon any other the like just occasion, and they themselves be judge whether the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
be just or no; whether may not Independents, a part of the Kingdome only
doe the like in all respects? or whether ought they because a lesser part of the
Kingdome, to yeeld obedience to Popish Acts and Canons, because a major part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of and agree with a Parliament and Synod in establishing them?</p>
               <p>Whether would it not be an ungodly course for any people to hazard any thing
at the disposall of others, or to be carried by most voices, which may possibly, if not
more then probably he decided in such a mannee as the yeelding obedience thereunto
would be burthensome to their consciences, if not absolutely sinfull?</p>
               <p>Whether were it not an ungodly course for the whole Commons of a Kingdoms,
so farre differing in Religion as that they professe before hand that they dare not
yeeld to one another upon perill of damnation, to make choice of a Parliament and
Synod, with entring into Vow and Covenant to become afterwards all of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
whatsoever the Parliament and Synod should agree on? whether it be not
absurd for men to say they will be of such a Religion as shall be setled, before they se<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
evidence to convince them? and whether it be in the power of man to be really of
what Religion he will, untill he see reason and demonstration for it?</p>
               <p>If a representative State or Magistrate may make Lawes for setting up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or establishing what Church government they please; whether have not the
people the same power originally in themselves, to assume againe, and put it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
when they please? and whether were this otherwise than to attribute unto
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51165:13"/>
a mixt multitude, to the World, if not absolutely as it is distinguished from the
Saints in Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 18. 19. and 17. 6. 9. 11. 14. at least by most voices,
to make choice of a Religion, Laws and Discipline, wherewith the Saints, houshold
and Church of God must necessarily be governed?</p>
               <p>Suppose a Lutheran and Calvinist, or any others differing in opinion; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may they out of hypocrisie or implicitly submit and be comformable to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
discipline and doctrine whereof they doubt, before they be convinced?
Whether have either of them an infallible way to convince the other, and bring
them over to be sincerely of their opinion before their understandings be satisfied?
if they have, why doe they not put it in execution? if they have not, why should
they be offended with one another if they continue differing?</p>
               <p>Whether opposing Gods people or their wayes be not a fighting against God? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not extreamest rashnesse, if not absolute madnesse and presumption to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing which may possibly prove a fighting against God? and whether
any man in these dayes can have a fuller assurance in his owne conscience, or give
better evidence unto others that he doth not oppose the people of God whilest he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
such as differ from him in opinion, than <hi>Paul</hi> whilest he <hi>persecuted the

                  <hi>COuld the foregoing Answer have found as free a passage at the Presse
as your Questions did, it might have presented it selfe to you a month
ago; &amp; though in the interim I have had the sight of a second dozen of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories,
I may safely professe the reading of them did not administer
unto me any other matter of edifying, than to finde and bemoane the
want of those</hi> sober minded, and peaceably disposed men, <hi>&amp;c. you spake of in
your Preface to the former dozen, which might</hi> sadly ponder and seriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
them: <hi>however since they are presented as a second course, though I
confesse my stomack was overcome at very first, yet that you may see I am
not easily prevailed upon to passe by any thing of Mr.</hi> Pryns <hi>without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall,
please to be contented that I observe your 2 Intergatory is,</hi> Whether
Independents doe not extraordinarily ecclipse, impeach, if not absolutely deny and
subvert the lawfull power of Civill Magistrates, all former Parliaments, and
this present too in all matters of Church Government, and Ecclesiasticall affairs,
<hi>&amp;c. But from what is thereby insinuated</hi> A. S. <hi>doth freely cleer the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents
in his Observat. and Annotat. upon the Apologeticall narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where he saies, That</hi> the Civill Magistrate arrogates not to himselfe (not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51165:14"/>
so much as) any directive power in matters of Religion. <hi>p.</hi> 5. The Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
arrogates no Spiretuall authority to himselfe. <hi>p.</hi> 48. The Parliament indeed
is the supreame Judicatory, severe Tribunall, the most sacred refuge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Civill
causes, but it pretends no directive power in matters of Religion, by teaching or
preaching, or judging of controversies of Religion; nor any executive power that is
intrinsecall to the Church, as in the vocation, deposition, and suspension of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
&amp;c. <hi>(which I conceive the Committee for Religion will not like
of)</hi> which are meerly, spirituall. <hi>p.</hi> 6. If your meaning be that the Parliament
should judge between the Independents and Presbyterians, you goe against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
intention: <hi>ibid. and lastly,</hi> For intrinsecall spirituall power, it is not in
your power to grant the Civill Magistrate any at all; neither can you give him
more spirituall obedience than Scripture permitteth you, or give him a part of the
spirituall power which you have received of God, It is only in God who can give
power therein to any man we dare not be so bold. <hi>p. 28. Now if this doctrine be
Presbyterian, and Presbyterian good, and that deny unto, nay make the
Civill Magistrate disclaime all authority in matters of Religion; with
what justice are Independents censured as subverters of the Civill powers
for saying but the same? If it be objected, that</hi> A. S. <hi>seems to be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
opinion in other passages; let but the objecters reconcile him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and the great controversie between Independents and Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
will be well neere composed: But that you may see the Independents
assume no greater liberty of dissenting from their brethren in matters of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
than is warrantable by the Presbyterian rule: See likewise what</hi>
A. S. <hi>sayes p. 22. to wit;</hi> It is safe even for a few men to dissent from all the
World if they have very strong reason for their dissent. <hi>p.</hi> 28. Particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
are not subject unto the judgement of Senates or Assemblies, but according
to the word of God: <hi>and lastly,</hi> It is holden for a certaine and undoubted maxime
amongst all Procestants, that the Church has no absolute power in her judgements,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> You your selfe cannot say lesse, unlesse you make an Idoll of them;
yet if you will but grant them thus much, they are totally and sincerely the
Civill Magistrates, and yours in all the rest.</p>
               <p>In your third Intergatory, you insinuate That <hi>the Independents conceive a
right and liberty of gathering to themselves such as are Parishioners of 20 other
godly Ministers by the established laws and customes, which you say our solemns
Vow and Covenant obligeth us to maintaine:</hi> Good Sir, tell me, Are they the
Episcopall Laws of <hi>England,</hi> the Presbyteriall Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Laws of <hi>Ireland</hi> which you call established Laws? for the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Ireland</hi> both representative and represented, will now no doubt
he able to declare by Club-law wherein your best argument and strength
consists, that the Popish are now the established Laws of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51165:14"/>
of them is it your expect us to be engaged to by out solemne Vow and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant?
(for doubtlesse there are many who thinke the Covenant obliges
us unto all three alike in their respective senses, for no few both Popish,
Episcopall, Presbyteriall and Independent men have taken it in no other:)
The Popish I conceive you will renounce, though by your owne manner
of arguing you cannot even at present get cleare thereof as touching <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
nor <hi>England</hi> when ere we have a Popish Parliament againe: As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Episcopacy, I presume you understand of a Bill prepared for its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation;
and why may not Presbytery be kept out as lawfully if the
State and Nation shall thinke fitting according to your second-conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Question? wherein since you doe in effect gratifie a Parliament and
Presbyteriall Synod with a power of setting up a Nationall Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Religion: and in your fourth Interrogatory you tell us, That
Kings and Parliaments have the selfe same jurisdiction in and over all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
matters which are not positively of divine institution and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
as in and over temporall; will it not follow by the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that a Popish or Episcopall King and Parliament may doe, or have
the same in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Ireland?</hi> But have you not in these two lines
said in effect, That men must conforme to Presbyteriall, Episcopall, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
rites and government to all alike, if King and Parliament be such,
whilest they proclaime them to be according to the Word of God? Nay,
may not this present Assembly, whom you court with <hi>most orthodox, pious,
conscientious learned Ministers, especially selected, 2 Interg.</hi> taking up your
owne words, call this a <hi>cursed project,</hi> or <hi>new kinde of Gunpowder, 2 Interg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
whereby you have left them nothing to debate or give consent to, but
what the King and Parliament might doe without them? for where finde:
we warrant for assembling of a Synod to debate or decree any thing
which was before positively divine institution and injunction? and for
all the rest, have you not granted it to King and Parliament? Surely you
have no way to make the covetous amongst the Clergie amends for this
escape of yours, unlesse you vindicate their tithes; this, and this only may
yet procure your pardon &amp; indulgency; you drive it forward with a gentle
blow both in the beginning and end of your 3 Interg. concerning which,
having given them as briefe a touch in my Answer to your 12 Question,
I referre you to what else is said in this behalfe more largely in the <hi>Bloody
Tenet,</hi> (not so bloody a tractate as your dozens of Questions and Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toryes)

and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> (who cried, Prepare the way of the Lord, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

consciences of Gods Saints to be subjected thereunto, as if they had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

Act. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28.)</p>
               <p>But if Episcopacie be guilty and condemned both root and branch,
must not Presbytery have it <hi>Mittimus</hi> and packe away therewith? where
are the branches of Episcopacie to be found unlesse amongst the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
how can Episcopacie be Antichristian, and the Presbyters who have
no other Ministery, require the same Jewish tithes, and though formerly,
but subordinately, doe now joyntly execute the same dominion over the
consciences of their brethren? But if you meane that we are bound by the
League and Covenant to maintain the established Laws and customes of the
respective Kingdomes, and bring them to such a uniformity (with all
meanes sanctified for such a purpose can lead them to) according to the
word of God; you say well, if our Brethren of Scotland meane the like:
But will they be contented that an Act of our present Parliament prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to cut off English Episcopacie shall doe the like good justice upon the
Scotch Presbytery if they conceive it requisit? Nay, will they give us leave
to examine, refine, purge and punish their Presbytery for such misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
such trampling underfoot of Christian Liberty, such enslaving the
consciences of Gods people by humane Acts and Ordinances, with divers
others, all which are thought fitting to be censured in Episcopacie?</p>
               <p>To conclude then, we finde it prophesied of our Saviour before his birth, That he should
