            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We have relieved Mountgomery-castle, wherein there was closely besieged, and much distressed the L. <hi>Herbert</hi> of Cherbury, Col. <hi>Price,</hi> and most of Sir <hi>Tho. Middletons</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and neere 500 Souldiers.</p>
            <p>We were so very hard tasked by the multitude of our enemies, (who did much exceed us in number) as that, if the Commanders and Souldiers had not engaged, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themselves very gallantly; or if we had wanted any part of our forces, it might have hazzarded our Army, for it was very dubious and uncertaine which way the Lord would incline the victory: it came to push of Pike, wherein
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50974:3"/>
they were much too hard for us, having many more Pikes Our horse also at the beginning of the battell were worst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; retreated; but there was, I doe believe an unanimous resolution both in horse and foot to fight it out to the last man. Indeed there could be no other hope nor expectation of safety or escape, there remaining no way of retreat, all passages being entirely in the enemies power (if masters of the field;) and truly if God had not infatuated, they might easily have interrupted our passage, and made good divers passes against us. But our extremity was Gods opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to magnifie his power; for when it was most dubious the Lord so guided and encouraged our men, that with one fresh valiant charge we routed and put to retreat and flight their whole Army, pursued them many miles, even in the Mountaines, and did perform great execution upon them; slew (I doe believe) 500, wounded many more, tooke neere 1500 prisoners, and amongst them Colonel <hi>Broughton,</hi> and Col. <hi>Tilsley,</hi> who they report to be General majors; there were also taken Lieutenant Colonels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Major<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Captaines, more then twenty; and all their Carriage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and neere 20 barrels of Powder, wherein they were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the night before the battell; We tooke also as was conceived) neere 1500. or 2000. Armes, most for foot. Most of their horse escaped towards Shrewsbury, and Chester.</p>
            <p>The enemies Army was reported, (and I doe believe it) was no lesse then 4000. the Foot being the old Irish who came out of Ireland with Col. <hi>Broughton, Warren, Tyllier,</hi> and some of Col. <hi>Ellis,</hi> and some of Col Sir <hi>Michael Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses,</hi> and Sir <hi>Michael Ernlys</hi> Regiment, from Shrewsbury, Chester, and Ludlow. Our Army consisted of about 1500 Foot, and 1500 horse. We lost not 40 men slame, and I doe believe, there was not 60 wounded. Our greatest losse
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50974:3"/>
was of Sir Wil. Fairfax, and Major <hi>Fitz-Simons,</hi> most gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant men. <hi>Sir John Meldrum</hi> did with much judgement order and command these forces, and therefore deserves a large share in the honour of this daies successe. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole honour and glory is to be given and ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God the giver of victories, and who is most deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly stiled the Lord of Hosts.</p>
            <p>What remaines further to be done in prosecution of this victory shall not be omitted; and if it please God that Newcastle be delivered, and some Scottish Forces assigned to assist to the taking in of Chester, I hope through Gods mercy there may be a good account given of all these parts of the Kingdome.

Sir</hi> Iohn Meldrum, <hi>with Sir</hi> William Brereton, <hi>and Sir</hi> William Fairfax <hi>marched with 3000 Horse and Foot towards Mountgomery, and came thither on the 17 of this instant September, where we lay that night in the field that was most advantagious for us, which the enemy had possest themselves of before, and diserted at our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

thither, placing themselves upon the mountaine above the Castle, a place of great advantage for them; we resolved not to goe to them, but to endeavour the victualling of the Castle; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we sent out parties for the bringing in of provisons; which the enemy perceiving, they marched downe in a body both Horse and Foot, being in number about 5000. and came up to our ground, and gave us battell; wherein, after an houres fight, it pleased God we obtained a glorious victory, having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many Officers, 1400 common Souldiers, slaine 400, and taken their Ammunition, with a great part of their Armes, and some few horse, the rest all flying away; the Lord</hi> Byron <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in chiefe the enemies forces, and Sir</hi> Iohn Meldrum <hi>the Parliaments forces, who behaved himselfe most bravely and gallantly; and Sir</hi> William Fairfax, <hi>who had the command of the horse did most valiantly set upon their horse, and engaged himselfe so farre that he was taken prisoner, but presently fetcht off by the valour of our men, but sore wounded; our men issued also out of the Castle, and fell upon the enemies in their trencher, and tooke divers of their Officers, and Souldiers, which they had left to keepe their Workes; Sir</hi> William Brereton <hi>with the Cheshire foot did most bravely behave themselves that day, and did beat the best Foot in England, as they the very enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, being all Prince</hi> Ruperts <hi>foot, and the chosen foot out of all their Garrisons.

industrie and resolution, taken in by Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> together with a great deale of powder, match and brimstone, which (coming from Bristoll) was prepared for the relief of Shrewsbury, Chester, and Leverpoole: upon our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach towards the Castle, the Enemie did withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in some disorder, the next day after being the 18. of September, they did take the advantage of the weaknesse of our Quarters, the third part of our Horse being imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad for victualls and forrage; their Horse and Foot came on, with great courage, resolving to breake through our Forces, and to make themselves Masters of a Bridge we had gained, the night before: which would have cut off the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of our retreat: It pleased God to dispose so of the issue of the businesse, that (by the resolution of the Officers, and Souldiers, of Horse and Foot) the Enemy did loose the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they had in the beginning, and were shamefully rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the pursuit of the victorie, which continued for the space of three miles: there are found dead upon the place five hundred, besides many Officers of quallity killed and wounded, and twelve hundred Prisoners: Sir <hi>William Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi> and Major <hi>Fitsimons</hi> (who caried themselves most brav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) are deadly wounded, without great hope of recovery, with some other Captains and Officers of our Horse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the Cheshire Foot with their Officers, carried themselves more like Lyons, then men, especially Major <hi>Lowthian</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as Major Generall: The Castle is releeved with victualls, Sir <hi>Thomas Middletons</hi> Souldiers who were before as Prisoners, are made free, together with the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> of Cherberie: amongst the Prisoners Major Generall <hi>Tilliseley,</hi> Colonell <hi>Broughton,</hi> and divers Lievtenant-Colonells and Majors, with many Captains and Lievtenants, so that by the blow given here, the best of their Foot are taken away, Shrewsburie, Chester, and Leverpoole, unfurnished with Ammunition; and North Wales (which formerly hath been

the nurserie for the Kings Armies) in all likelihood, will shake of that yoke of servitude which formerly did lie upon their necks, and wilbe reduced to the obedience of King and Parliament, by the example of Montgomery Castle, which is one of the goodliest and strongest places that ever I looked upon. The personall carriage and indeavours of Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> hath been exceeding great in the advancement of this service. There is good hope that Leverpoole by famine wilbe soone rendered, and that Shrewsbury, and Chester will be at the last gaspe, whereof by Gods assistance there shalbe a short triall made.
