            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The which the moſt times doe note and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate vnto vs the Ire and wrath of God, againſt vs for our ſinnes and wickedneſſe, that we haue and doe dayly commit agaynſt him. But mans heart is ſo hardened that thoſe his threatnings and foreſhewings are reiected as though they were but fables. Therefore many times the Elements haue bene and be the heraulds and executors of Gods Iuſtice, as we do read in the viij. chapter of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,<note place="margin">Geneſ, 8</note> that the waters ouerflowed the toppe of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mountaine. xv. cubites, and drowned all the worlde except viij. perſons. The fire in lyke manner as we do read in the xix. chapter of Geneſis conſumed &amp; burned<note place="margin">Geneſ. 19</note> the Citie of Sodoma and Gomorra. Alſo the earth as we may read in the xvi. chap. of Numeri opened hir mouth<note place="margin">Num. 16</note> and ſwallowed vp Chorah, Dathan, and Abiron. Beſides an infinite number of examples more, which are to bee ſeene in the holy Scripture, and all was done for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe &amp; ſinnes of the people. Therefore the rather to moue the harts of euery good chriſtian to feare &amp; tremble at the ſight of ſuch prodigious monſters, I haue taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to tranſlate out of French into our Engliſh tongue theſe two monſters, the one of a Popiſh Aſle which was found at Rome in the yeare of our Lord. 1496. And the other of a Moonkiſh Calfe, calued at Friberge in the yeare 1528.</p>
            <p>

Signifiyng that theſe two Monſters may well be compared vnto the Pope and his rablement of Cardinals, Abbottes, Biſhops, Prieſts, Canons, Moonks and Fryers, as Gods meſſengers, to giue warning vnto them that Gods wrath is redy at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to deſtroy both him &amp; his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with his whole rable of Cardinals, Moonks &amp; ſhauelings, diſguiſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſo againſt nature, as theſe two Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſters were.

            <p>As for me, I will deſire willingly that the latter day were at hande: the which I alſo doe thinke, that the dayes wherein we are, are as forerunners of that bleſſed day, the which will not tary long after. And me thinketh that the cauſe that I haue to hope ſo, is not friuolous nor vaine. And in very déede, before time ther hath ben almoſt a continuation of certeine worlds, in which men haue ſéene dayly monſtrous things, and worthy of great admiration: And at this day all the worlde burning with a terrible heat, bringeth forth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions very pernicious, who commonly are not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without great chaunges &amp; alterations of kingdoms. To conclude, that the lyght of the Goſpell, ſhineth
<pb facs="tcp:7416:17"/>
now wonderfully, the which commonly was wont to bring with it alterations, troubles and tempeſts, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the hard obſtination, and furious ragings of the wicked.</p>
            <p>And truly I will not ſpeake but of things which are true: and will ſhew wherefore God hath ſet foorth ſuch a ſigne in that Moonkiſh Calfe, and for what cauſe hée hath defiled the religious habite or apparayle with one ſo vyle a ſpotte: Foraſmuch as without the habite of a Moonke hée might ſignifie and declare the euills to come as properly and well by any other ſhew or token. Euen ſo then it is not long ſithence that by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence was calued at <hi>Langdesberge</hi> a certeine Canon Calfe, or a Moonkiſh Calfe. It declareth thereby, that all religious men and Moonkes ought to haue their eyes thereon ſtill fixed, and that he beholdeth them, and that he hath determined to puniſh them: For this ſame yeare he will vſe none other miracles, then thoſe which haue reſpecte vnto ſuch holy and ſpirituall peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>For god paynting out of late that excellent Monarch<note place="margin">Daniel 8. d</note> of <hi>Alexander</hi> king of <hi>Macedonia</hi> vnder the figure and lykeneſſe of a Goate, beſides the Propheticall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion of the diſcomfiture and vanquiſhing to come: he hath alſo ſet foorth and repreſented the nature of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> which are wanton as the Goates. And all that that they haue conceiued in their minde how high and harde that it be, they hope to bring it to paſſe, and to atteine vnto it through good councells, through great viua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>neſſe of the minde.</p>
            <p>In lyke manner in this figure of this Moonkiſh Calfe, beſides the Propheticall declaration, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an Image or figure of the lyfe, of the doctrine of the ſeruices and obſeruations of the Moonkes: And it is poſſible that thereby there is an aduertiſement of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7416:17"/>
cauſe of the calamities nighe at hande. That is to ſaye, that the ſuperſtitions, the deceites and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Moonkes, doe cauſe the puniſhment to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, for as much as by the Phariſaycall doctrine of woorkes, they doe aboliſh the fayth which is in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and doe tranſforme and chaunge into the fleſh of a Calfe mans heart, which ought to bée the Temple of the holy Ghoſt. Furthermore, let an other drawe the propheticall ſence: as for mée for to pleaſe my order, I haue taken vpon me to interpret my Moonkiſh Calfe: The Canon Calfe ſhall haue an other for his expoſiter.</p>
            <p>For ſo much the more willingly doe I take the charge to make this declaration, for that I doe ſée that the obſtinate courages and more harder then the rockes, of thoſe which ſhall bée grieued with this my explication, ſhall bée ſo much the more wounded and ſhall bée come more eger. As in very déede they doe arrogantlye deſpiſe all that whiche commeth out of my mouth, and doe babble euery where, that all my woordes are as much to bée eſtéemed as the ſpittinges of heretickes. For that cauſe they ought not alſo now<note place="margin">The interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made for to harden the heartes of thoſe vvhich do giue no credit vnto the aduertiſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the faithfull.

neuertheleſſe hée could not amende it: ſo one may ſay the lyke of thoſe holy Fathers, which haue hetherto ſtopped their eares at the cléere voyce of the veritie of the Goſpell. Nowe they ought to beholde themſelues in this Calfe and in the Cowe, as in a glaſſe, and to conſider what they are before God, and what reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and what voice they haue in heauen. And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe they ought to ſhut their eyes that they doe ſée nothing of all this, whereoff they may repent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, for to auoid the horrible iudgement of God. For there is neither forewarning, word nor ſigne that could<note place="margin">The hearts har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened after the example of Pha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rao.</note> moue or bend the hard heart of <hi>Pharao.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, that I may ſpeak briefly, thinke not, that the ſame is a mockery or a fable, that God hath clothed a Calfe with a religious habite, &amp; with a Moonkes coole. Wée muſt not doubt, but that he noteth by that Image or figure, a certeine aſſemble of people, of whiche one may cléerely knowe, that the Moonkery is nothing els<note place="margin">The Moonkery is but a vaine appearaunce.</note> but a vaine appearaunce and ſhewe of godlyneſſe, and outward hipocriſie of a holy lyfe allowed of God.

            <p>But vnto whom is that goodly ſeruice repreſented? who is honoured? of whome doth it depende? vnto whom is it tyed and faſtened? vnto the Calfe.

Beholde, this is the Calfe, this is the impietie: this is the carnal opinion couered and hid with the religious habite: this is the Idoll to the which they are bounde and tyed, the which they dooe garniſh and beautifie with Ceremonies and with a goodly kinde of ſhewes. The Calfe doth not liue but of hearbes and graſſe. For ſuch hipocrites haue no knowledge of the eternall goodneſſe, but doe fat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the pleaſures of this preſent lyfe: As one may playnly ſée that the moſt puiſſanteſt and ample ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<note place="margin">VVhat it is to be nourished &amp; ſed vvith graſſe</note> and the moſt greateſt pleaſures, and the moſt higheſt dignities and honours are belonging vnto the people of the Church, as one calleth them. And euen ſo theſe Calues haue found graſſe for their owne tooth.

            <p>But theſe madde braynes, ſuperſticious and too holy Moonkes knew very well to forge, inuent &amp; finde out ſo many differences of ſectes and opinions, as there is of diuers apparayle among them.

            <p>Thirdly, this Calfe repreſenteth the geſture and countenaunce of a Preacher.

            <p>For can any man finde an Apoſtle more fit for the braine of an Aſſe, then the head of a Calfe? This is a fit couer for the pot.</p>
            <p>The carnall gouernment hath alwayes a carnall doctrine. And therefore the Calfe is yet without eyes, or blinde, for to figure thoſe of whome Ieſus Chriſt

And the hornes doe ſignifie the Preaching of the Goſpell, the which make vs obedient vnto death or to the croſſe, deſtroying the olde manne: as it is ſayde by the Prophet <hi>Micheah</hi> the fourth Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will<note place="margin">Micheah. 4. d. 13</note> make thy horne yron and thy clawes ſhall bée of braſſe, that thou mayſt grinde and cruſh in préeces ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people.</p>
            <p>Yet neuertheleſſe this Calfe hath no hornes, but<note place="margin">The Moonkes doe turne the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell vnto mens traditions</note> onely certeyne appearaunce or tokens of hornes, which doe not much appeare.</p>
            <p>For although that thoſe dooe bragge and boaſte themſelues of that title, that they are Doctours of the Goſpell: Yet neuertheleſſe they doe tourne

it foolyſhly vnto the traditions of men. So then from the crowne of the head, which is ſhauen, doe appeare two lyttle knobbes lyke vnto peaſe. For vnder the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>And for that the Coole is ſo faſt behinde the<note place="margin">The Moonkes coole or hood tyed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neck.</note> necke, the ſame declareth the incredible obſtination of the ſuperſticion and of the errours of theſe doltiſhe Moonkes, concerning the obſeruations and Monaſticall ceremonyes. As in very déede they are plunged and faſtened ſo déepe within ſuch filthineſſe, that there is neyther vertue nor force, nor the lyght of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian veritie, how great ſoeuer that it bée, which canne in any wiſe draw them foorth for to beholde the lyght.</p>
            <p>Now for that the Coole was tyed and cloſe behinde<note place="margin">The Moonkes do keepe and hold faſt the hood &amp; forſake &amp; let go tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory goods</note> at the backe, and that towards the belly or before it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be open or vnſewed, doth ſignifie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe doe ſhew in their outward apparayle a certeine godlyneſſe: and it is vnder the coulour that they doe forſake and renounce all tranſitory goodes. But if they muſt come vnto God, or if one would bring them to the eternall lyfe, one ſhal finde that thoſe are naked bellyes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable burthens for to conſume the goods of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, yea committing all enormities: of which I loue rather to holde my peace.</p>
            <p>And whereas that the Iawes below are lyke vnto the Iawes of a man, and thoſe aboue with the noſtrels lyke vnto thoſe of a Calfe, the ſame ſignifieth that in their doctrine they ſpeake very oft of the ciuile workes of the heauenly law: But in the meane ſeaſon there is

nothing but that it ſmelleth and ſauoreth of the Calfe: that is to ſay, that the diſcipline, righteouſneſſe and the Philoſophicall vertues are there too much prayſed.</p>
            <p>For the two lips of the mouth, do ſignifie two ſorts and kindes of doctrines: the nether lip ſignifieth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plycation of the Law: and the vpper lyp the preaching of the Goſpell and of the heauenly promiſes.
