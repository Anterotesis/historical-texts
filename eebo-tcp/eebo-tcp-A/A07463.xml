            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In ſchooles now were the chairesvoide of their learned doctours, no man deliuered lawes from Iuſtinian the Emperour, the ſolace of the ſicke Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates was then, and Galene eke vnknowen, the ſciences exiled then, the ſcriptures were not taught, the tonges were all forgotten, Philoſophie, the loue of wiſedome, there a ſtraunger.

when all thynges grewe on, to ſuche diſorder, when policie gaue rome, and place to hoſtilitie, when ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and armed menne had all thynges in poſſeſsion when none liued voyde of feare, when no ſtate was aſſured, then knewe I not what better to dooe, or how better to ſpende the long, and wearie howers, then at tymes to buſie my ſelfe in ſome lighte, and pleaſant ſtudie. By meanes whereof, I choſe to wade into this Foreste, wherein I muſte confeſſe, I had ſuche preſent likyng, as ſeldome my happe hath been or neuer to finde the ſemblable. So hauyng then bothe redde hym, and redde hym through againe, with due conſideration of the excellencie, and great learnyng of the aucthour, I thought I could not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpende that ſo wearie a tyme, then in tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng this Foreſte, into our naturall language, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie my countrie therwith, to whiche not to our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues we liue ſtill, and ſtill are borne. Eſpecially for that I knewe it written, in three ſunderie tounges, in the Spaniſhe firſte, by Petrus Meſsia, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne of Siuile, and thence dooen into the Italian, and laſte into the Frenche, by Claudius Grugette, late Citezein of Paris: wiſhyng that wee were ſo labourous, and ſo diligent, that no thyng emongeſte them were written, whiche we with theim impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

For beyng as it is a collection of ſunderie matters, the lacke of one annoieth not, or maihemeth not th' other, yet for my full diſcharge, and purgation herein, I wiſhe that the ſkilled in the tounges, at their leaſure ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For euidente is it, that <hi>Adam</hi> lyued nine hundred and thirtie yéeres: <hi>Sethe,</hi> nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twelue: <hi>Caine,</hi> nine hundred and tenne.

Which opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is open folly, an errour too too great, and altogeather inexcuſable, as wée ſhall make euidente
<pb facs="tcp:12963:8"/>
in the Chapter folowing, hauinge here firſt remembred the aduice of certaine graue, wiſe, &amp; learned Authours. When therefore I reade the iudgemente of others, and in fine thence deſcende vnto mine owne opinion, the principal reaſon, mée thinketh, why we in this time, liue not as longe as did others in the firſte, and Olde Age, is, that our Forefathers had not then any the cauſes, whiche in vs newe ingender diuers maladies, and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whence neceſſarily enſue Stoopinge Age, &amp; Deathe. Here muſte wée alſo conſider, that our firſte Parentes, <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> were created, and framed by the very hande of God, without any other aide or meane: whence it is to be preſumed, that he perfected them with comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion moſte excellent, with a true <hi>Sympathia,</hi> and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humours, the cauſe of theire continued healthe in theſe their many yéeres. By meanes wherof, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, iſſuinge of Parentes of ſuche perfecte conſtitution, as alſo theire Ofſpringe riſinge to them againe, whiche naturally lyued ſo longe, and many daies, muſte reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble theire Elders in like perfection, and conſtitution of bodye, as men takinge either theire beginninge, or bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, of a matter moſt pure and ſimple, vntill ſutch time as by the chaunge of Ages (whoſe propertie is to alter, and to impayre al thinges) the ſtate of Man beganne to weaken, yéeldinge his daies in number fewer then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Againe in that Age, one thinge to them was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry helpinge, and profitable: the whiche ſame to vs is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noyſome, and contrary: whiche was the greate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancy vſed in Drinkinge, as well in quantitie, as in qualitie alſo, with the ſmall chaunge, and varietie of Meates: for neither had they ſo many ſortes, or ſundrie diſhes, as wée, ne knewe they any, or newe, or dainty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions. To eate Fleaſhe, what it was, before the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Floudde, was vnto Man altogeather vnknowen. Further, ſome hold for common, &amp; moſt aſſured opinion, that bothe Fruites, and Hearbes without all compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12963:8"/>
were in thoſe daies of farre greater efficacie, and vertue, then any, founde any where in this our latter Age: for that they then ſprange out of a new, and fyned ſoyle, and not of ſutche as nowe it is worne, waſted, weryed, and conſumed. For the Generall Inundation tooke from it, his woorthe or fatneſſe, leauinge it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte, infertile and barren, reſtinge ſalte and vnſauery, by the rage of the Sea, whiche many wéekes flowed ouer it. Theſe reaſons then are good, and eche of them ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conclude, that it neither was ſo ſtraung, or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous, but rather a thinge moſt agréeant vnto nature, that men then lyued longer, then in theſe daies preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Farther it maie be ſaide, (that whiche wée for an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured truthe holde) that <hi>Adam</hi> well knewe the vertues of all Hearbes, Plantes, and Stoanes, whiche alſo his Succeſſours, of him in ſutche ſorte learned, that to the like perfection after them, neuer any attained. This then was graunted them of ſomme parte for the preſeruation of their healthe, for the continuance, and protraction of their daies in this worlde: who to expel the cauſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, if any grewe on them, only vſed to miniſter Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, abhorring our venemous compoundes of this Age: whiche in place to purge, and purifie mans bodye, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and diſpatche for the moſte parte the poore patiente. Againe in theſe aboue remembred firſte yéeres, both the life, and healthe of man was propte, and ſuſtained by the courſe of the Heauens, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> influence of the Starres, and Planettes, then farre more beneficiall, then they preſently nowe are: for that then there neither had paſte ſo many Aſpectes, Coniunctions, Eclipſes, with other infinite Impreſſion Celeſtiall, whence nowe procéede ſo many chaunges, variations, &amp; alterations on the Earth, and emonge the Elementes alſo in thoſe daies principal occaſion of healthe, and continuance, contrarye nowe in this our Age of all ſickeneſſe, and deathe. But aboue all that, that wée haue here alleaged, or by reaſon haue
<pb facs="tcp:12963:9"/>
any waye proued, I nowe mainteine the many yéeres of theſe our Firſte Fathers, to haue procéeded of the only, and inſpeakeable prouidence of God, whoſe Maieſtye would their continuance ſhoulde be ſutch, and ſo longe, and that theſe aboue remembred cauſes, ayded mutually one the other, to the only intente, that of twoo perſons might then increaſe many, that the Earthe might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and mankinde increaſed. Alſo farther conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe, that for as mutche as Man after the fludde, liued not ſo longe as before: God licenſed that they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Arke, and there ſaue them ſelues, more Men and Woomen then him ſelfe in the beginning, and at the firſt had Created, to the only ende, that the world might the ſooner be inhabited. <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> of this matter, writinge ſome thinge, reporteth, that our Forefathers <note place="margin">Li. 15. de Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Dei.</note> hadde not only in health, and many daies, aduantage of vs, but alſo in huge and greate ſtatures of body, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, remembred by many, their boanes as well found in their Sepulchres, and Graues, as alſo at times vnder great Mountaines and Hilles: in ſutche ſorte that ſome aſſuredly hold, that thei were the boanes of ſuch as liued before the Inundation.

               <p>FOr that it appeared vnto ſome, that the ſpace of nine hundred yéeres, in our firſte Fathers ſéemed a thing altogether impoſſible, leſſe able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſe or receiue theſe aboue remembred reaſons by vs alleaged, the only and ſole cauſes of that ſo longe a life. And where as they durſte not to denie the foreſaide number of yéeres, ſo plainely and openly ſpecified, and geuen vs out of holy Write, they affirme, that the yéeres of the firſt age, were farre more ſhorter, then theſe of our time: ſo that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of longe life, whiche is vnto them attributed ſo farre aboue vs, is not ſo greate as it hathe benne ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Somme others emonge them would alſo aſſure vs, that one of our yéeres, containeth tenne of that age paſt. Alſo many others haue ſaide, that eche courſe of the Moone yéelded vnto them one whole, full, and compleate yéere, whiche it pleaſed them to tearme, <hi>Annus Lunaris.</hi> Others ſome alſo dreamed, that thrée of our Monethes gaue to them a yéere: ſo that this accoumptinge, foure of theire yéeres lendeth vs iuſte one, and no more. For that in this ſorte, as wel the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> parted theire yéeres, as remembreth <hi>Lactantius. M.

<pb facs="tcp:12963:10"/>
aboue haue remembred) by the ſpace onely of thrée Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes without more. There is alſo emonge vs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, a certaine Booke, of the Ages of the worlde, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Eliconienſis,</hi> where he alſo ſéemeth to be of the ſaide minde, and aduice. Notwithſtanding it appeareth moſte euidently, that the yéeres mentioned in the Holy Scriptures, were none others, then theſe of our time, &amp; that if there were any kinde of difference, ſutche it was, as was not almoſte ſenſible. Which thinge is very well proued by <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> as alſo by <hi>Lactantius Firmianus,</hi> but yet more perfectly, and more plainely by <hi>S. Auguſtine:</hi> by whoſe authoritie, and reaſons, eaſily may be confounded who ſo leaneth to the contrarye. Touchinge the firſte, that eche Moone in that Age gaue them one full yéere, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumptinge euermore from the one Coniunction vnto the other, it reſteth an eroour moſte open, and euidente: for that wée wel know, that, that conteineth not thirtie dayes full, ſo that one hundred yéeres folowing this our accoumpte, would mounte vnto aboue one thouſand and twoo hundred of theirs of that time. Whence it woulde folowe contrarye to the opinion of all, that men in our Age nowe preſently lyue longer, then they did immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the Creation of the world, for that neuer was there any man, that liued one thouſande and twoo hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yéeres, whiche nothinge ſurmounteth this Age of ours. It alſo is apparente, that ſomme emonge vs liue an hundred yéeres, ſomme alſo (thoughe rare it chaunce) an hundred and twelue, whiche woulde riſe to more then a thouſande and thrée hundred yéeres, accoumpting them accordinge to the courſe of the Moone. Like errour to this, was not alſo theirs, which affirmed tenne yéeres of the firſte Age paſte, to be iuſte one, and no more of this our time? For had that their opinion bene true, then ſhould men haue benne able in the acte of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the Age of ſeuen, eighte, and tenne yéeres, which ſquareth with no rule, or parte of Philoſophie. For
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12963:10"/>
proofe whereof, wée reade in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that <hi>Seth</hi> the ſonne <note place="margin">Geneſis. 5.</note> of <hi>Adam</hi> begatte <hi>Enoch,</hi> beinge then olde an hundred and fiue yéeres. If then ten yéeres of that Age, had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared by iuſt proportion but vnto one of theſe oures, it then ſhoulde followe, that theſe of the firſte Age, at the Age of tenne yéeres and a halfe, of this time preſent ſhoulde be ſtronge and able in the acte of Generation. <hi>Cain</hi> alſo hauinge iſſue at thréeſcoare and tenne yéeres, ſhould haue alſo benne Father, followinge our accompt at the ende of his firſt ſeuen yéeres, yea and that whiche more is, at a farre yonger Age, if one of our yéeres had counterpeaſed twelue of the firſte Age, as diuerſe haue not leafte lightly to ſurmiſe. But wée ſhall more plainly yet vnfolde this their fowle faulte, and by this reaſon weaken their inexcuſable errour. If their yéere were but the tenth, or tweluth parte of oures, then conſequently muſt it follow, that their yéere had not twelue Moneths, or at leaſt that their Moneth had but three daies: whiche is falſe, for that the ſayde texte of the Scripture ſaithe, that the generall Floudde began the ſeuentiene daye of the ſeconde Moneth: whence wee euidenily learne, that the moneths of that time, where none other then are oures. Concerninge the others whoſe opinion was, that a yeere in the firſte Age, was but the fourth parte of one in this: their yéere beinge the ſpace of thrée moneths on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is proued by the ſaide péece of Scripture, to be in like manner falſe. For in the ſame place is it readde, that the Arke of <hi>Noë</hi> flottinge on the waters, arreſted it ſelf, the ſeuen and twentie daie of the ſeuenth Moneth, whiche (the waters fallen) firſt ſtaide it ſelfe in the Mountaines of <hi>Armenia.</hi> Againe, after is it written, that the waters <note place="margin">Geneſis. 8.</note> dayly diminiſhed vntill the tenth Moneth, and that in the firſte daie of the ſaide moneth, the toppes of highe Hilles and Mountaines, eche where diſcouered them ſelues. Whence nowe lie euident the errours of thoſe, whiche meaſured for their yéere, the onely ſpace of thrée
<pb facs="tcp:12963:11"/>
Moneths, for that mention is here made bothe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth and tenth. Then may wée well learne, that the auncient yéere had alſo twelue Moneths, as haue in this laſte Age ſemblably oures, for that remembringe the tenth, it mindeth leſſe nothing then the ende, or the laſt. And as ill alſo may that be ſaide, that their Moneth had but thrée daies onely: for of the ſeuen and twentie daye of the Moneth, plaine and expreſſe mention lieth open in the Texte. But leaſt of all may it be ſuppoſed, that their daies had of length but twoo or thrée howers, for that the ſame Texte againe reporteth, that it raigned, and the windowes of Heauen were opened, by the full ſpace of fourtie daies and fourtie nightes. So now then is it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the daies were naturall of foure and twentie howres, the Moneths and yéeres none other then are oures, or at leaſt very ſmall and inſenſible was the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Whiche thinge to that ende, I onely haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for that all men accompted the courſe of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens as wée doo, ſo that this order amonge the learned, the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> I meane, as well as the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> hath benne reuerently eche where, and alwaies obſerued: among whom <hi>Moyſes</hi> the Hiſtoriographer was brought vp, Author of thoſe holy Bookes, where theſe longe liues are recorded. Now if wée would ſubſcribe to the opinion of many, who affirme the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> to haue meaſured their Moneths by the courſe of the Moone, geuinge forth their yéere complete by the twelue Moneths <hi>Lunaries,</hi> eche Moneth hauinge onely niene and twentie daies, &amp; fouretene howres, or at the leaſt very litle more or leſſe, by meanes whereof, the yéere might ende aboute twelue daies ſhorter, then that whiche wée meaſure by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Sunne, whiche is thrée hundreth, thirty and fiue daies, and ſixe howres. This difference notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge, ne yet leaueth doubtfull, or of any parte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, the longe and great Age of our forepaſſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for a ſmal matter is it in niene hundred, or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12963:11"/>
yéeres, to exempte twentie, or thirtie: for that the Monethes <hi>Lunaryes</hi> were not full thirtie dayes. Hence then conclude wée by this authoritie, certaine, that the nine hundred and thirtie yéeres whiche <hi>Adam</hi> liued, the nine hundred alſo of the others, were ſutch, as were the hundred thrée ſcoare and fiuetiene of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſutch alſo as are the thrée ſcoare and tenne, and foure ſcoare of of our time, for the moſte parte, the extreame tearme, &amp; ende of our lyues. There is alſo one other, and ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable conſideration to be noted, to this pourpoſe allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>S.

               <p>ONe of the perfecteſt notes to knowe a Wiſe man, is, if he well can couer the Secrete committed to him by an other, holdinge euermore his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres cloaſe and vnknowen. Who ſo of the time paſte will reade the Auncient Hiſtories, ſhall finde that a number of vertuous enterpriſes, miſte farre, and fowly failed of their deſired ende, in time of Peace, as well, as alſo in that of Warre, by the onely reuealinge of ſome deuiſed Secretes, whence infinite miſchiefes haſtely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued and followed. But amonge ſundry examples, one wée finde excellent and ſurpaſſinge the reſte, as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, or directly, procéedinge from God: who to him ſelfe ſo well reſerueth his Secretes, that he ne reuealeth to any the things that ſhall happen, or betide vs tomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: as alſo neither they that liued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ages paſt, could at any time Diuine any thinge, of the thinges this daye preſent. Whence it is eaſie for eche man to conſider, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12963:12"/>
vnto God him ſelfe, to conceale wel a Secrete, is a thing agreant, acceptable, and pleaſinge. Who though he haue for mans ſake, to him diſcouered ſome thinge, yet to let, or preuent, his prouident intention, was neuer to any Creature yet of any parte poſſible. By meanes whereof the wiſe, and ſage in al Ages, haue loued and learned, to conceale, and couer their Secretes. Wée reade that <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſour confeſt oftentimes to his Friendes, that he of thrée thinges right often, and greuouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented him: The firſt, that he to any body had vnfolded his Counſels, or Secretes, but aboue al others eſpecially vnto a Wooman: The ſeconde, that he had paſte ſome iourneys by Sea, whiche he more ſafely might haue paſt with litle payne by the Lande: The third, that he idlely, and without fruite, had ſpente in his time any one daye. The twoo laſte, merite well of all men to be noted, and the firſte well aunſweareth to this our preſent purpoſe. <hi>Alexander</hi> on a time, receiuinge from his Mother cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine letters of importance, whiche after he had peruſed ſecretely with <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> cloſde vp his lippes, with his ſecrete Seale or Signet, geuinge openly thereby to all men to vnderſtand, that he to whom a man in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels affieth him, ſhoulde euermore haue his mouthe well cloſde, and ſhutte vp. When the Kinge <hi>Liſimachus</hi> had offered vnto the Poëte <hi>Phillipides,</hi> what ſo ſhould pleaſe him to aſke or demaunde, he incontinently anſweared: the greateſt good turne that your grace can do mée, is not to communicate with me any parte of your Counſels. <hi>Antonius Sabellicus</hi> retcieth to the ſaide purpoſe, ſurely a notable and marueilous example. In the time of Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> ſaith he, the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> had a Capitaine named <hi>Cremignoll,</hi> by whoſe Treaſon, and diſloyalty, the Army of the <hi>Venitians</hi> was to their great harme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited. By meanes whereof the Senatours driuen to further conſultation, how &amp; in what ſorte they ſhould deale with this Capitayne, ſome beinge of the opinion

                  </gap> iuſtice on him: but others yet then were of opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. In fine therefore this was their concluſion, that preſently, and for that time, they woulde diſſemble the matter, as though they nothinge had felte of his barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous treacherie, attendinge notwithſtandinge ſomme fitter occaſion then that, mindinge euermore to execute him, that ſo iuſtly had deſerued it. This their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was deferred for the ſpace of eight Moneths, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe whiche time (ſo well could eche man conceale theſe affaires) yée though they were in number many, many alſo moſte aſſured friendes of the ſaide <hi>Cremignoll,</hi> ſome poore, and of meane condition, whiche to haue aduertiſed him of theſe newes, mighte haue receiued large &amp; ample rewardes. Theſe thinges not lettinge, their paſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, was at the ende of theſe eight Moneths yet then cloſe and Secrete, at whiche time it was decreed that he ſhould come to <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Senate, with many woordes, &amp; with faire countenances receiued him, whiche notwithſtanding, the nexte morninge apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and did him forth with for his diſloyaltie to die. This then might ſerue for example, vnto al Senatours, Iudges, Counſellers, and others of our time: to the end that they better kéepe and conceale their affayres, then others ſome that haue reuealed thinges to their greate hurte, ſhame, and detriment. To the confuſion of which, I ſhall here remember a pleaſant diſcourſe, recited by <hi>Aulus Gellius, Noctibus Atticis,</hi> as alſo by <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his Saturnales, &amp; hath this. The <hi>Romaine</hi> Senatours enteringe into their Senate at <hi>Rome,</hi> accuſtomed eche one to bringe with him his Sonne, and that as ſoone as he was ones able to go, and to the Children of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie was graunted this Priuiledge, vntill they were fully ſeuentene yéeres olde: to the intente, that behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the reuerent order of their Parentes, they in time to come afterwarde, aduaunſed to ripe Age, and fitte for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12963:13"/>
Gouernment, might the better be inſtructed in common and Publike affayres? So carefully beſides were theſe Infantes inſtructed, that out of the Senate they neuer diſcouered, or diſcloſed any thinge. It happened on a daie, the Senate then ſittinge on greate, and weighty matters, and beſides their accuſtomed howre of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, longer continuynge that their aſſemble, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination notwithſtanding reſerued vntill the morrow, with ſtraght inhibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in the meane time no worde were thereof in any reſpect ſpoken. But amonge other children then that day there preſent, there was one yong boye, the Sonne of <hi>Papyrius,</hi> of one of the moſt Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt families in <hi>Rome.</hi> This Childe at night beinge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, his Mother firſt by intreatie, in flatteryng ſorte deſired him, to learne her, what matters were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated that daie in the Senate, conſideringe their longe abode, beſides the woonted manner. To whom the boye anſweared that he might not well diſcloſe it, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe it was prohibited, thereof to ſpeake any thinge. Shée this mutche vnderſtandinge (as is the common woonte, and vſage of Woomen) waxte then mutche more earneſt thereof to féele ſome thinge, in ſutche ſorte, that neither, by faire woordes, nor flattery able to gette any thinge, woulde with threates, and roddes finally force him, to anſweare her leſſe honeſt, &amp; haſty importunitie. Whoſe malice to auoide, this wiſe, and wilye Boye, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing him wel of this pretie guile, ſaide: that this defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent was amongeſt them that daie carefully handled, whither as well for the ſtate Publike, as alſo for the augmentation, and more ſpéedy increaſe of Mankinde, it mighte be more conducible to the whole Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> that one Man ſhoulde haue twoo Wiues, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that one Wooman, ſhould be geuen to twoo Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes, which bothe partes failed not, of moſt earneſt, &amp; aſſured Factours: who the nerte day (ſaithe he) will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude on ſome final &amp; reſolute determination.

On the morninge folowing a great number of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Matrones, were in flockes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at the Gates of the Senate, effectuouſly, and in many woordes requitinge theire Lordes not to paſſe on any ſo vniuſte a Decrée, as to geue to one man in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age twoo wiues, but rather to goe forewarde without ſtaye to the contrary. The Senatours leſſe wetinge to what pourpoſe this tended, amazed, in entrance, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other into the Senate, demaunded eche of other, whence mighte procéede this ſo rare, and ſhameleſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuilitie, altogeather vnable, thereof to yéelde any cauſe, or reaſon. But in the ende, the yonge boye, the little <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrius,</hi> did them out of payne, layinge before them, what had chaunced him the night paſſed with his Moother, and howe that for feare of her thunderinge threates, and greate woordes, was forced for his diſcharge, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſorte to deceiue, and beguile her. The matter thus then vnderſtoode by the whole Houſe, they highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the ſecrete conſtancie in the childe. Concluding notwithſtandinge, that thencefoorthe no Father ſhoulde bringe with him his childe into that place, beſides the younge <hi>Papyrius,</hi> whiche onely after entered, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente <note place="margin">Papyrius.</note> that by theſe meanes, no ſecretes ſhoulde out of that Houſe, or Place be reuealed. By the practiſe of this childe againe, maie the Elders of our Age, what to doo in their affayres, be very well aduertiſed: conſideringe that if a Priuate Secrete be not to be diſcloſed, mutche leſſe then a Common, and Publique Secrete, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emonge the Aged, and men of aſſured Iudgemente.

Hence grounded they their foundation, vpon the harte of man: in whiche by often, and common Anotomyes, they founde, and perceiued certaine mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous Secretes. For ſaide they, when Man was of the age of one yéere, then poiſed his harte onely twoo of their Drammes: when be was twoo yéeres olde, then poiſed it foure, and ſo foorthe howe many yéeres ſo euer he liued, by proportion ſtill grewe his harte to be of like number of Drammes. In ſutche ſorte, that beinge ones fiftie yéeres olde, Mannes harte ſhoulde wieghe then an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Drammes: and from thence, by like proportion ſtill he looſeth of his weight, eche yéere twoo Drammes, euen as before he increaſed. So that at the ende of an hundred yéeres, the Harte by continuall decreaſe, is becomme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge: ſo that conſequently of neceſſitie, Man then muſt die, if before he be not preuented by ſomme accidentall occaſion, whiche bothe can, and dooth commonly in ſuche manner abridge our dayes, that very fewe of vs liue the one halfe to experiment this matter.

               <p>OF the Compoſition of man ſundry are the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, of whiche <hi>Lactantius Firmianus</hi> a parte, as alſo ſomme others, haue written, large, &amp; wery volumes: in whiche one thinge, amonge others many, requireth ſomme exact &amp; particuler examination. Which is, that it hath pleaſed God to frame al Creatures, Man onely excepted, with the heade hanginge, and ſtoupinge forewarde, their eies ſtill fixte, or for the moſte parte, on the Earthe: and not only brute Beaſtes, but al Plantes and Bodyes vegetable. As is ſéene in trées, whiche haue their heades, or rootes faſte lockte, or hidde in the earthe, the bowes, or braunches mounting into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayre on highe. But Man he hathe created with eies bente towardes Heauen, his body ſtraighte and righte, his face aduaunſt on highe, Goddes woorkes ſtill to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate, &amp; conſider. And althoughe for this matter, it mighte ſuffice to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage the onely prouidence of God, yet ſéemeth it to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of ſomme Myſterie, or Secrete, and therefore woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſomme further conſideration. Our Diſpoſition then moſte aſſuredly learneth vs, yea by moſte plaine, and euidente ſigne, that wée are not created, and framed for the Earthe, to haue in admyration thinges baſe, and tranſitorie: but to be buſied in things on highe &amp; heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12963:22"/>
Of whiche with Man, no other Creature maye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate: vnwoorthy, and incapable of ſutche, and ſo great benefites: Man only for them, euen from the firſte ordeined. God hathe created all creatures with heade hanginge, and bente ſtill to the grounde, to ſhewe, that he to Man hathe geuen ouer them, all kinde of Rule, and Authoritie to order them. Whiche thinge is well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Lactantius Firmianus,</hi> who ſaithe: That God hauinge determined to create Man for Heauen, al other Creatures vnreaſonable, onely for the Earthe: he made Man a creature capable of aduice, righte, and ſtraighte, naturally ordeined, and inſtituted to Celeſtial Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation: to the intente he onely mighte reuerence him, that he mighte honour the place of his firſte ſpringe, and beginninge, that he mighte acknowledge the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie that he is borne to: ſhapinge other Creatures bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge and ſtoopinge, as hauinge no parte, or participation of Heauen. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who had of the true faithe no fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, <note place="margin">Ariſt. Lib. 2. de Natura Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malium.</note> ſaithe: That onely Man, emonge other Creatures marcheth vprighte: for that him ſelfe, and his Countrye are not Terreane, but Celeſtiall. And further, That the office of Diuine mindes, is to vnderſtande, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, in which function, neither ſhoulde Man haue kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen how ſkilfully to haue ordered him ſelfe, had he bene of a lumpiſhe, heauye, or vnfittinge ſhape: for that the weightie maſſe, and huge lumpe of the bodye, yéeldeth the memorie, and recordation with other partes of the Soule, inſenſible. <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> who leafte no matter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, or vnexamined, in his Expoſition of Youtke, and Age, hathe to this pourpoſe, ſutche woordes as fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe. For twoo cauſes was Man formed righte, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge Heauen: The one, for that he ſhoulde be the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſt of other Creatures, and ſutche as ſhoulde taſte, or ſauer of all Celeſtial qualities. The other, for that in the proportion, and temperature of his bodye, he is more hoate then any other Creature, and that the nature of
<pb facs="tcp:12963:23"/>
heate is euermore to mounte, and aſcende vpwardes. Other Creatures, as far inferiour, as alſo leſſe perfecte, leſſe participate in theſe Celeſtiall qualities, and leſſe naturall heate haue they in any ſorte to aduaunce them. For whiche cauſe, neither are they of the ſame frame, or proportion with Man. It ſéemeth, that in this place <hi>S. Thomas</hi> folowed the opinion of the <hi>Platoniſtes,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that naturall heate, with ſundrie the Vitall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites in Man (in whiche he more aboundeth then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liuinge Creature) are the onely cauſes that he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vprightly, aduaunced in manner ſo perfect, and ſo ſéemely, for that by the force, and vigor of the foreſaide powres and bloudde, he addreſſeth him ſelfe vpwardes. That which his indeuour more perfectly to accompliſhe, he further againe is ayded by the true proportion, and mixture of the Elementes: of whiche he borroweth his firſte ſpringe, and beginninge with ſutche equalitie, and conueniente weighte, that he fitly, and commodiouſly walketh, addreſſing him ſelfe to looke on the marueilous frame of Heauen. Nowe then ſith Man, of parte, by the perfection of his Soule, as alſo of parte, by the excellent feauture of his Bodye, is beroughte with the loue, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation of Heauen, he ſhould only woorke, thinke, and deuiſe thinges Heauenly, &amp; Spirituall, diſdeininge the Earthe, with all thinges thereon tranſitorye. But wée be in ſutch ſorte enamoured with the vile conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of worldly pleaſures, that for the moſt part hauing our eies, and countenaunce bente to Heauen, the harte lyeth ſoylde belowe vpon the Earthe. Againe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Man, of whom wée haue here ſpoken, <hi>Pline</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth an other thinge, whiche thoughe it be not of ſutche importance, as are the others, yet may it of ſomme parte contente, and pleaſe the Reader, eſpecially to whome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hathe not reuealed it, founde notwithſtanding daily to be true, of all ſutche as pleaſe carefully to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimente it. He ſaithe, that Man dead, poyſeth more then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12963:23"/>
when he liued: that whiche he alſo affirmeth in all other kinde of Creatures. Againe he ſaithe, that Man hauing eaten in the morninge, poyſeth leſſe, then when he was before faſtinge. Whiche thinge is by <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Probleame of his confirmed. Who alſo in the ſame remembreth other ſomme things not vnwoorthy of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge: yéeldinge the ſame reaſons, with <hi>Pline,</hi> for the confirmation thereof, grounded on the conſideration of the Vitall Spirites, and Ayre, as is aboue rehearſed. Whereas the contrarye ſéemeth to haue ſomme ſhewe of truth, for that who ſo ſhal take at any time his refection, layeth vp within him ſelfe, the poyſe and weight therof. Notwithſtandinge, it is euident, that the refection al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies increaſeth the vitall Spirites, whiche ſolace, and comforte man, increaſinge, and multiplyinge naturall heate within him. Hence cometh it, that when one man from the grounde aſſayeth to lifte an other, the lifted is then more weighty, when he dothe breathe or conuaye his winde out, not redrawinge it agayne for the ſmall time of that practiſe: the whiche when he retayneth in his body &amp; kéepeth in, is founde by meane thereof, more light then he was before: Againe who ſo faſte runneth, neither maye he for that time either breathe, or blowe mutche, for reſtrayning his breathe, he findeth him ſelfe more agile and quicke, for that the Ayre beinge an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very lighte, deſireth to riſe vp, and to mounte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lofte, where his naturall place is, of reſte or aboade: as experience may learne vs, in a ſkinne or bladder, whiche empty, &amp; not pufte vp, throwne into the water, ſinketh continually, &amp; reſteth on the bottome: but full of winde, or blowne out, ſwimmeth ſtill on highe. <hi>Pline</hi> in the ſame place againe recordeth, that mans body in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drowned, and after a time riſinge from the bottome on highe, if it be a man, he euermore hath his face turned from the Earthe vpwardes, but if it be a woman, ſhée continually floteth in manner and ſorte contrary, which

Lib. 1. de Morbis acutis.</note> ouer all other partes in man: and <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Timeo,</hi> in conſideration of the prerogatiue thereof, termeth it, the whole body. It beinge then of ſo greate importance, the Fountaine alſo and chiefe ſpringe, of eche the powers in man, it is of neceſſitie that it ſhoulde be of fitte propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and forme conuenable. Whence it commeth that <hi>Paulus Eginetus,</hi> in his firſt Booke, <hi>De Medicina,</hi> ſaithe: that a very little Heade is a ſigne certaine of a weake iudgement, and that who ſo hathe a very ſmall Heade, wanteth withall iuſte quantitie of brayne. The ſame reaſon alleageth <hi>Iohannes Alexandrinus,</hi> ſayinge: the little Heade is as noyſome and incommodious, as is the leſſe compaſſed, or ouer ſtraight Breaſt, for as (ſaithe he) the breaſt, is the harber of the Harte, &amp; Lounges, whiche without many diſcommodities, maye not tolerate or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be too ſtraightly impriſoned, eſpecially for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harte beinge too cloſely ſhutte vp, cannot commodiouſly without annoye at any time moue it.

<pb facs="tcp:12963:25"/>
decent, it then argueth a good witte, as alſo a ſure &amp; faſte memory. The Philoſophers affirme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Man hauing his Head once ſtriken of, incontinently becometh vnable to moue or ſtirre, although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of reſpiration ſhould not thereby be extinguiſhed, but for that the Vaines are ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, the onely meanes, &amp; ſole inſtruments of Motion in al Creatures liuing.

It is alſo written of <hi>Dionyſius Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gita,</hi> that he, his heade beinge ſtriken of, wente notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge from the place of execution, one full Leage or more. But this no doubte, was more myraculous, then naturall. Emong al other Creatures liuinge, Man only and Horſe, as affirmeth <hi>Pline,</hi> waxe white, or heare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes theire later daies or ende. And Man, for that he <note place="margin">Pline, Lib. 2.</note> hath his heade more rounde, higher aduaunced, and voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of putrifaction, is therefore knowen more ſure, and able, as on the contrarye, who ſo ſauereth moſte of this vnperfite moyſture, is found moſt commonly, of weake, and ſimple iudgemente.

IN the firſte Age, or beginninge of the Worlde, euen vntill the Fludde, and many yéeres afterwarde, men generally throughout had féelinge but of one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, al diuerſitie then hidde, and vnknowen man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeakinge. No man then ſpake with tongue, or ſtraunge, or leſſe familier, no voice was from other in any thinge then different, no newe deuiſe in ſpeakinge was then knowen, or thought on. The diuerſitie then firſte, or confuſion of tongues, the Mother of eche miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, &amp; cauſe of all annoye, the ſole Nurſe of litigious, and impacable debates, was for mans ſinne and pryde (as a iuſte ſcourge) on him layde. <hi>Moyſes</hi> in the Hiſtorie of <hi>Geneſis</hi> recordeth, that <hi>Nemrod</hi> Nephewe to <hi>Noë,</hi> by the lyne of <hi>Cain,</hi> with others more lyke proude, and of like ambitious nature, were then borne, when firſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge <note place="margin">Geneſis.

At that time this <hi>Nemrod,</hi> with his vnaduiſed companye, determined togeather, to frame or builde a Tower, whiche from the Earth might reache to the face of Heauen it ſelfe. Whiche thinge they onely did, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in memory yet the late forepaſſed Fludde, to eſcape the hande of God, if he at any other time ſhoulde waſhe the Earth againe. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in the firſt Booke of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, <note place="margin">Ioſephus.</note> ſaithe: that he from all partes had ſutch ſyéedy healpe, for the erection of his buildinges, that in ſhorte time it grewe bothe marueilous prowde and pompous.

But God who iuſtly chaſtiſed this prowde preſumptuous enterpriſe, though not with payne deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, gaue in that preſente inſtante, ſo many diuerſe tongues, ſo ſtraunge, and ſo unknowen, that theſe who all before ſpake one, and the ſame Language, ſpake then thréeſcoare and twelue, ſo farre and differente from the

By meanes wherof, him ſelfe, and his family, whiche woulde not condeſcende to this ſinfull, and prowde attempte, felte not thereof the due deſerued paine. Wherefore wée maye preſume that in <hi>Heber,</hi> and his family, the auncient, and firſte Tongue remained perfect, and entire, without any corruption or confuſion of the ſame, in that Linage onely pure, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where els in the Worlde: whence it came to paſſe, that of <hi>Heber,</hi> it had his denomination <hi>Hebrewe.</hi> Sundry <hi>Hebrewes</hi> his Succeſſours affirme, that this Language was that ſame, that was firſte ſpoken by <hi>Adam,</hi> as alſo of all the others, of that Auncient and firſte Age, conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Heber,</hi> and thoſe that followed him, <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob.</hi> In this ſame alſo wrote <hi>Moyſes</hi> his Lawes. This then is the opinion of <hi>S.

Notwithſtandinge, in this matter, ſome curious haue doubted, if twoo children, or a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, foſtred in place ſecrete voyde of all company, where they neuer mighte heare the voyce of any other, what woordes they woulde frame, or Language in the ende. Somme haue thought that they firſte would ſpeake <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe:</hi> others ſomme the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Tongue. But <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> ſaithe, that on a time experience in this caſe was <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> made, by meane of a contention, or emulation then growen betwixte the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and <hi>Frigians:</hi> eche na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pretendinge by antiquitie of their Language, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminency aboue the other. For determination of which differente in fine they concluded, that twoo Children ſhould be nouriſhed in manner aboue rehearſed, in ſutch ſorte that they ſhoulde neuer heare any woorde ſpoken at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12963:29"/>
all, and that Language, that theſe children firſte began to profite in, ſhould be reputed the firſte, and moſt Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and they that ſpake that, by conſequent of moſte antiquitie. He addeth againe afterward, that a certaine Kinge of <hi>Aegypte,</hi> cauſed to be foſtered twoo children in a deſerte, to which no man euer ſpake in any ſorte in the worlde, whiche when they were full foure yéeres olde, he cauſed them without more, to be brought into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, where they eftſoones vttered this onely woorde <hi>Ber,</hi> whiche dothe in the <hi>Frigian</hi> tongue ſignifie Breade: for whiche cauſe the <hi>Frigians</hi> were of all men reputed as moſte Ancient. This writeth <hi>Herodotus,</hi> whom many herein approue, &amp; alleage for authoritie. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge were it (as he reporteth it) a truth, yet might it be that theſe Children by happe, ſome where ſhoulde learne it, as by ſomme Beaſte, Birde, or Shéepe in the Fielde, whiche might frame the ſame, or ſome ſutche like voyce, they doinge their paine to frame the ſame after them. But as for my parte, I reſte of this minde, that twoo Children in this ſorte foſtered, would ſpeake none other but the firſte Language, <hi>Hebrewe:</hi> although I alſo durſt in manner ſemblable to affirme, that to them ſelues they would ſhape ſomme newe, and ſtraunge Tongue, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge to all thinges their names vnknowen &amp; vnheard, as wée ſée, that Children of them ſelues naturally: geue names leſſe knowen, to thinges of them deſired, ſo that of parte aſſuredly it appeareth, that nature would learne them a Language all newe, before they ſhould be perfect in any their Fathers. In this caſe experience may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſchoole vs, if any very curious, deſire to knowe the effect hereof. In the meane time eche man may here reſte, of what opinion it beſte liketh him, nothing aboue, ſaide withſtandinge the contrary.</p>

In diuiſion of whiche, there is founde emonge many, ſutche greate confuſion, and difference in reckeninge, that hardly a man maie herein aſſure him of a truth. They that deale herein, are diuided into twoo partes: of whiche, the one foloweth the computation of the thréeſcoare and twelue Interpreters, whiche tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated the Olde Teſtamente from the <hi>Hebrewe,</hi> into the <hi>Greeke.</hi> The other, the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and common texte of the Bible: whoſe opinions I will, for contentation of all partes, hereafter remember. The firſte Age therefore, <note place="margin">The firſte Age.</note> or parte of the Worlde, accordinge to the common, and general accoumpt of al, was euen from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Creation of the ſame, to the Inundation, or Drowninge of it againe. Whiche was the Infancie, or tendereſt Age (as ſomme tearme it) of the Worlde. Whiche Age was longe, and of greate continuauce. Duringe whiche time, it is to be ſuppoſed, that greate, and marueilous matters chanced vnto men, although wee thereof finde no recorde, or Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, ſauinge that the Scriptures haue, that after God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12963:30"/>
had created <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> as alſo before him all other Creatures: ouer whom, he gaue him generall Dominion and Rule, as well ouer the beaſtes on the Lande, as fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes in the Sea. <hi>Adam</hi> then begatte twoo Sonnes, <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> whiche afterwarde alſo begat diuers others: by whome the worlde beganne then to be well peopled. <hi>Moyſes</hi> writeth, that <hi>Cain</hi> builte him, in the Eaſte parte <note place="margin">The firſte cittie of the world.</note> of the worlde, a Cittie, whiche after his Sonnes name, be called <hi>Honoch.</hi> In that time <hi>Lameth</hi> hauinge buried his wife, hardened him ſelfe to chooſe againe the ſeconde, (beinge the firſte <hi>Bigamus</hi> that euer was in this worlde) on one of the whiche he begat <hi>Tubal,</hi> who firſte founde the meane to Singe, by Arte, the Violles eke, and alſo the Organs. <hi>Cain</hi> founde the ſkill to woorke yron, and ingraue thereon. In this Age, the Worlde had alſo Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes: of whiche, ſundrye good writers thus mutche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte, that they were of exceſſiue ſtature, and force, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous roughe to intreate, and enimies to Mankinde. Finally, by the inſupportable burthen of Sinne, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Floudde waſhed the face of the whole Earthe. By means whereof, all mankinde, <hi>Noe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> onely reſerued, and ſuche as were with him in the Arke, was drowned. And <note place="margin">The contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of opinions concerning the firſt Age.</note> this firſte Age of the Worlde, according to the accoumpt of the <hi>Hebrewes, Filon, Beda, S.

               <p>IT lyeth vs on, of neceſſitie, bothe by the Lawes, and Commaundementes of God, to ſwincke, and toyle in this worlde continually: For our firſt Father hauing broken the Commaundemente of God, was banniſhed, and chaſed out of <hi>Paradis</hi> Terreſtriall: the Earthe lotted to him for his portion, or inheritaunce: with charge not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge to labour here, in continuall payne, and trauaile. Whiche charge, he neither receiued for any tearme or time, but for euer without ceaſſe, as longe as he liued: whiche neither appertained to the Firſte man onely, but vnto all his Poſteritie, and Succeſſion to the ende. And although this neceſſitie of Trauaile be laide on man, to call him to penance, yet is it a fitte Medicine to aſſwage the wronge paſſed: for that by our labour wée regayne that, whiche was loſte by diſobedience: and ſo mutch the more (although it be vnto vs a preſent ſcourg) for that God hathe condemned nothinge that was of it ſelfe leſſe good, graunting to Man Trauaile, to turne, and laboure the Earthe. Alſo <hi>Iob</hi> ſaithe: That Man is borne onely to ſweate, and to payne. Conſider againe, howe our Sauiour, and Redéemer <hi>Ieſus Chriſte,</hi> Mannes onely ſoueraigne Lorde, and Maiſter, to the example of vs all, lyued in continuall payne, and labour, euen vntil the time of his Deathe, and Paſſion. Beſides in his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,</hi> he ſharpely rebuketh ſuch as any where conſume, and waſte the time idlely, imbraſinge all thoſe that are vertuouſly buſied: vſinge in an other place theſe woordes to this pourpoſe: <hi>Comme vnto mee, all yee that are heauily lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and I will refreaſhe you.</hi> If wée will paine our ſelues to reade the Scriptures, wée ſhall finde, that the auncient Sainctes ſpente all their dayes, and Life, in continuall exerciſe of Vertue, and Godlineſſe. Further, trauaile is not onely conducible to the Soule, but alſo preſerueth
<pb facs="tcp:12963:39"/>
the healthe of the Body. For it by daily practiſe, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth agile, ſtronge, and well diſpoſed: in it are augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and increaſed the Vitall Spirites: the naughty, and ſuperflous humours conſumed. As touching the minde, it thence exileth all impi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ous, and vnchaſte thoughtes, preuentinge al occaſion of errour, and offence. Certaine is it, that nothinge of weightie importance, reacheth without paine to the deſired effecte or ende, as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, that eaſe, that is purchaſed with paine, is euer more then all others, more pleaſaunte, and likinge. He that taketh greate payne, repoſeth him ſelfe in eaſe: for to the weary man all thinges are fittinge, and agréeant: His Meate to him is ſwéete, and ſauery: He ſoundly ſlée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth without dreame or viſion: and all pleaſures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, are to him bothe gratefull, and acceptable. Who ſo trauaileth not, nor neuer becommeth wearye, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to him lendeth vnperfite contentment. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the commodities of the Bodye, woonted exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe frameth a man diſcrete, vigilante, well aduiſed, and ſage: and what els is profitable, thence iſſueth it, and ſpringeth contintinually vnto man. Trauaile is it that ordinarily prouideth a man of all thinges: the ſame it is, that frameth to him fayre houſes to dwel in: commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lanes, &amp; pathes to walke in: for the more eaſe of the poore paſſenger, greate ſhippes to croſſe, and ouerrunne the tumblinge Seas: and armour to defende vs from the force of the enimie: briefely, innumerable commodities thence take theire beginninge. By Laboure the ſterill ſoyle becommeth fruitefull, and plentuous: to ſutche as are drie, and withered, it conueigheth ſtreames of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, opening the bowels of the earthe, whence Springes iſſue abundantly: it aduaunceth the grounde, where ſo it is behouefull, ouerthrowinge Hilles, and Mountaines that any where annoye vs: it altereth the courſe of great Riuers, to moyſte therewith drye Countries: it alſo hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, and aydeth Nature, forcinge her to geue foorthe,

that of her ſelfe ſhée woulde not: it tameth, and maketh gentle the Sauage, and Wilde beaſte: it fineth mannes witte, and ſharpeneth his memorie, as alſo the other partes are thence onely quicke, and ready. To conclude, who ſo acquainteth him ſelfe with painefull Labours, reapeth thence pleaſinge fruites, ſutche as him ſelfe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. God wil not that his electe poſſeſſe Heauen by ſlée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge. If the pompous, &amp; ſumptuous buildinges, which thou eche where beholdeſt: if the ritche Caſtles, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laices of Princes: if famous Cities well peopled, ſéeme to thée greate matters, knowe it to be the Sweatte, and toyle of thine Aunceſters. If in manner ſemblable the Artes, and Sciences contente thée, knowe that they firſt ſprange of the Diuine Labour of ſutche as here liued in the forepaſſed Ages. When ſo thou beholdeſt the gréene and pleaſaunte Fieldes, daintie Gardens, and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Vineyardes, accoumpte that they be all the ſole fruites of Labour. For the Ideler knoweth not how to frame any thinge, but rather diſordereth what ſo he findeth any where perfected. By buſte induſtry men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to immortall renowme. That was it, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended theſe Sages to the Poſteritie, <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Pythagoras,</hi> with all the Learned crue: whiche neuer ceaſte to payne their bodyes, and mindes, ſtudying, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, readinge, and diſputinge, not mindinge at all, when they mighte at their pleaſure eate, or ſléepe, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, as moſt doo, couer their carion: to the vſe of theſe thinges notwithſtanding, when neceſſitie forced them, it was a thouſande times to them then more pleaſinge, and ſauery, then to any of theſe idle, and delicious glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons.

By meanes whereof, it lieth euidente, of al menne to be perceiued, that if Idleneſſe by painefull care, be not donne to exile, then all Offices muſte flide, and comme aſſuredly to nothinge: Mecanicall Artes, the ſtudie of Learninge, and good Letters: all polices, and Ciuill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement: Iuſtice her ſelfe: the Lawes: and in fine, the Nourſes of Wealthe, and Peace, muſte all without La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Payne, be ſubuerted.

Aduiſedly, if wée will, and exactly conſider all, what ſo euer God hathe in the worlde crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wée ſhal finde, that thoſe thinges ſurpaſſe the others in perfection, wherein he hathe beſtowed moſte payne, and trauaile. Beholde wée the Heauenly bodyes, voyde of immutation: the Sunne moueth continually: the Moone areſteth neuer: the Heauens them ſelues: the Starres, and Planettes, haue benne, are, and ſhall be in perpetuall motion. The Elemente of Fyre reſteth not voide of ſomme operation: the Ayre without ceaſe turneth it ſelfe from one place to an other. From the partes beneath, the litle ſpringes and fountaines mount vp perpetually: the Riuers ſtill flote, and ſhall doo for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: the Sea alſo vſeth his times to comme, and goe: the Earthe, althoughe in déede ſhée areſte her immoueable, (for ſo is it requiſite, to the intente man maie paſſe on her to and fro indamaged, repoſinge him ſelfe at times, as nature requireth) yet is ſhée neuertheleſſe either idle,

or vnbuſied, but geueth foorthe to the vſe of vs, Hearbes, Plantes, Trées, and Mettalles, as ſhée that of duetie is bounde to mainteine, and nouriſhe ſutche a number of Men, &amp; Beaſtes, as on her dwelleth. So that if wee now of theſe things with iudgyng eie conſider, wée ſhal finde, that Nature ſo mutche affecteth nothinge, as without ceaſſe continually to buſie her ſelfe in toile, &amp; trauaile, as to forme, frame, make, and vnmake, to produce, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe, to alter, and to chaunge, to perfecte, and orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe thinges in their kinde: not reaſtinge, or ſurceaſſing by any manner of meanes in the worlde. For confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, the Olde, &amp; Aunciente forepaſſed Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, neuer thought that they had ſpoken enough in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, &amp; praiſe of vertuous exerciſes. <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaithe, that inceſſant Labour ſurmounteth all thinges. <hi>Horace</hi> in his Sermons, that God to man hathe geuen nothing without Payne, and Trauaile. <hi>Euripides,</hi> Trauaile is the Father of Honour, and Renowme: and that God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth him (ſaith he) that liueth in Sweate. And againe, That, that onely is the pathe vnto Vertue: &amp; without it, there is no honour, praiſe, or good aduenture. <hi>Menander</hi> the Poete writeth, and in my fanſie aduiſedly, that he, who in healthe lyueth at any time idlely, with more ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardye haſardeth, then the afflicted, of an Ague. Like grace alſo hathe in theſe woordes, <hi>Democritus,</hi> Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Labour, ſauereth of no Payne. <hi>Hermicon,</hi> beinge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded whence he had learned his Science: Of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (ſaide he) and of longe experience. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, that man lyue honeſtly, and that he neuer leaue, in Vertue, to payne, and weary him ſelfe: for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome (ſaithe he) in the ende, maketh it pleaſaunte, and likinge. <hi>Salomon</hi> referreth the Ideler, to the example of the Ante.

And further, no one in the whole troupe of Loyterers, was euer in any Age renowmed with Vertues Title: or if any ſuch were borne of Honourable Race, or Lineage, certaine is it, that he either came to ruine, and miſerye, or otherwiſe loſte his Honour, and Lyfe: or at the leaſte, he no where coulde with warrante aſſure him ſelfe: Damage, &amp; ſhame the onely and infallible fruites of fooliſhe idleneſſe, and ſecuritie: of whiche alſo ſpringe vices innumerable, as is in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> approued in theſe woordes: <hi>Idleneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendereth all kindes of miſchiefe. Ouid</hi> remembreth, that Venerye is no where thought on, but onely emong nice, and delicate Idelers: for (ſaithe he) who ſo he be, leſſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in Vertue, imagineth vnchaſte thinges, and inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Treaſons, puttinge in execution all vice, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> accoumpteth Idleneſſe, emonge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Sinnes, for whiche <hi>Sodome</hi> was, in ſutche ſorte as wée reade, deſtroyed. And for my parte, I knowe no thinge, that with the ſlouthefull man proſpereth. The fire, if it be not foſtred, and couered with Woode, it fainteth, and waſteth, and in the ende is extinguiſhed. The Ayre, in obſcure, and darke place, voide of deſired motion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth foorthewith noyſomme, and infectious. The Water depriued of her courſe in runninge, putrifieth without ſtaye, annoyeth, and impoyſeneth.

Golde, that deſired mettall, if it be not wrought and poliſhed, looſeth vtterly his bewtie: yron alſo, with others the ſemblable, if not continually laboured and kepte, ruſte &amp; waſte, as experience learneth vs. Whole Prouinces, and Countries, not inhabited or peopled, are euermore bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and very infectious, in ſutch ſorte that it appeareth,

Beſides, he diuiſed ſutche a mercileſſe policie, as tofore hadde neuer benne in any place hearde of: he inhibited, that vnder payne of deathe, none ſhoulde be ſo hardye, to deplore, lamente, or make any ſhewe of mournefull ſemblant at
<pb facs="tcp:12963:47"/>
the deathe of thoſe, that it ſhoulde pleaſe him any waye, for any cauſe to execute. A Crueltie ſtraunge, and ſuche as hathe not benne knowen: for I déeme there can be no greater paine, then to inhibite the poore harte, that it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loade and diſcharge not it ſelf of his dolours, by alarmes &amp; teares. Alſo when he did to die any yonge maydens, he firſte committed them to his Tormentours to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowred of them, to the intent that with their death, they togeather ſhoulde loſe their honour, and Chaſtitie. He ſo much was pleaſed in ſpillinge of bloude, that vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge one had ſtaine him ſelfe, whom he before had Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to death, of pourpoſe to eſcape his mercileſſe, and cruell hande, ſighed with hawtie voice in lamentable manner, ſayinge: Oh howe vnhappely hathe this Crows eſcaped mée (by whiche name it pleaſed him to note the Condemned). For you muſte vnderſtande, that he in ſutch ſorte tormented the poore patient, before he would ſuffer him by any meanes to die: that they ſuppoſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente deathe to be to them bothe a gaine, and a grace. Straunge were it to write, what inuentions he vſed, &amp; newe tormentes in Execution. Sommetime he forced the Condemned exceſſiuely to drinke, and immediately woulde cauſe the Cundittes of their Vrine ſo ſtraitly to be bounde, that they by no meanes poſſible mighte eaſe them ſelues that waye: and ſo woulde he ſuffer them, in exceſſiue paine to languiſhe, till deathe ſhoulde take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for chaunge of theire life. And further, for his ſale and onely pleaſure, he cauſed other ſomme to be throwne into the Sea, from an excéedinge highe Cliffe, or Rockys banke in the Ile of <hi>Capraire,</hi> adioyninge vnto <hi>Naples:</hi> and for becauſe that after that ſorte to die in the Sea, was, as he thoughte, a deathe too gentle, he cauſed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Marriners, and others, with Pikes and ſharpe weapons in Boates to ſtande directly vnderneathe the ſaide Rocke, whiche receiued, and bloudely martyred the miſerable patientes, before they might enioye the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite

of the Water. Nowe after the ſhameful deathe of this incarnate Deuill, ſuch in déede as him ſelfe had wel deſerued, <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> ſuccéeded in the Empire: who either was equall, or rather ſurpaſſed his Predeceſſours in all kinde of monſterous, &amp; accurſed tyrannies. He on a time, with greate affection wiſhed, that all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitauntes of <hi>Rome</hi> had togeather but one heade, to the intent that at one blowe he might ſtrike it of. He ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complained of the infelicitie of his time, for that there chaunced not, during his Raigne, any Famine, Plague, Generall Inundations, Subuerſions, and Diuaſtations of Countries, with many ſutche other dreadfull, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable calamities. Of a certaine man he demaunded, banniſhed by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> howe he liued, or what he did du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe his Exile: who in perfecte flattery anſweared, that he inceſſantly had praied to God, to call hence <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to the ende that he mighte ſuccéede him without ſtaye in the Empyre. Whiche thinge conſidered of by this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous Traytour, and doubtinge leaſte ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes whiche he had exiled, ſhoulde in like manner pray to God for his deathe, ſente foorthewith into all partes to call them home againe: whom immediately after their ſpéedie returne, he commaunded to be executed without reſpect of any. He ſtraitly charged all his Tormentours that they by litle and litle ſhoulde tormente the afflicted Innocentes, ſo that by ſmall paines they might beginne to die, protractinge their death as longe as was poſſible: for he would (he ſaide) that they felte howe their life fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in them. He alſo ſaide, that others eftſoones, of his complexion ſaide, The people wiſhe me ill, for that they feare mée. After this, <hi>Caligula</hi> ſuccéeded <hi>Nero</hi> in execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble malice, not at all his inferiour. For proufe whereof, he practiſed ſutch a mercileſſe tyrannie, as wel in it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed all other petie Treacheries. For without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to thinges holy or prophane, to the Maieſtrate, what ſo euer he were, or priuate Subiecte, he cauſed the

Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſette on fire, inhibitinge all men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of deathe, by any meanes what ſo euer, to quenche or aſſwage it: neuer woulde he that any man ſhoulde ſaue any parte of his goodes. So continued this fire, waſtinge and conſuminge the Cittie, ſeuen dayes fully &amp; ſeuen nightes, to the ende him ſelfe out of a highe Tower, not farre of, beholdinge it, reioyſinge at this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous, and mournefull ſpectacle.

Aſſuredly this was he, that beyonde all others raged moſte in crueltie: for he was the firſte that perſecuted the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and in his time was the firſt, &amp; greateſt Perſecution of the Church. He made open ſhe we of his ſurpaſſinge crueltie, of his vnmeaſurable, and furious brutalitie: for hearinge on a time a <hi>Greeke</hi> verſe, in effecte thus mutche ſignifiynge:</p>

He made to be ſharpened many ſplinters of woode, whiche, as farre as was poſſible, he cauſed to be thruſte in betwixte the nayles and the fleaſhe. Into boylinge Tinne or Leade, other ſomme he did aliue to be throwen: &amp; wéemen faſte bounde to Scaffoldes or Fourmes, he commaunded to be ſcortcht with hotte yrons on the backe.

               <p>The thirde Age containeth eight yéeres, and of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers, is called <hi>Adoleſcencie,</hi> and beginneth at the ende of the fourtenth yéere of our Age, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vntill the laſte daye of the twoo and twentie: during whiche time, ruleth principally the thirde Planete <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> For then Man beginneth firſte to be prone vnto Venerie, apte, and able in the acte of generation, buſied in Loue, and pleaſinge in the company of Woomen, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to Playe, Pleaſure, Muſicke and Bankettes, with ſutche other wanton and vnprofitable trifles. And thus liueth he, for the moſte parte of Nature bente to this fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: yet notwithſtandinge Man hath continually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lefte or impeachment, his frée choyſe, no neceſſitie bindinge him to this or that inconuenience, of ſufficient puiſance to follow, or to withſtande theſe inclinations, for that no force of Planetes, or influence of Starres, bindeth Man againſt his will to any neceſſitie, although it incline the apetite ſenſitiue, as alſo other partes or members of the body, in ſutche ſorte that man in caſes, hath either likinge or diſlikinge, frée notwithſtandinge from ineuitable neceſſitie.</p>

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:12963:52"/>
The Fourth Age continueth, till Man haue fully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye and twoo yéeres, whiche Age men commonly terme, and call Youthe, it abideth with him twentie yéeres to the ende. Of this Age the <hi>Sunne</hi> is chiefe Lorde and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, and poſſeſſeth as his Kingdome, the middle or fourth Spheare, called of auncient Aſtrologians, the fountaine of all Light, the eye of the Earth, Kinge of the Planetes, and harte of the Worlde. This Age is the moſte perfectſt, and moſt excellent of the others, it is the bewtie and flowre of mans life. Duringe this Age, the forces and powres, bothe of the vnderſtandinge, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, acquire, and retaine their vertue, and vigor. Man therefore in this time, well aduiſed and hardy, becometh ſkilfull to knowe and chooſe, that is good for him, he ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and ſearcheth Honour and Ritches, he laboreth to be accompted greate and renowmed, he buſieth him ſelfe in laudable and vertuous Actions: Briefe, generally in all thinges, he euidently declareth that the <hi>Sunne</hi> ouer him, hath rule and dominion.</p>
               <p>The Fifte Age in Latine, is called <hi>Aetas virilis,</hi> and hath fiftiene yéeres for his continuance, ſubiecte vnto <hi>Mars,</hi> who of him ſelfe is euill and daungerous, fierce &amp; hoate, inclining men to Auarice, he cauſeth diſeaſes, and increaſeth Coller in more then iuſte quantitie. In this Age man liueth temperate in diette, conſtant and firme in all his déedes, woordes, and couenantes.</p>
               <p>Then ioyne twelue to fiftie ſixe, and there arriſeth ſixtie and eight, whiche fully ſhall terme, and ende this our ſixte Age, in Latine called not vnproperly <hi>Senectus,</hi> of whiche Age is <hi>Iupiter</hi> the very Lorde and Maiſter, a Planete very Noble, and ſignificatour of Equitie, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Pietie, Temperance, and Chaſtitie: prouokinge men to leaue all toyle and trauayle, ſéekinge a quiet life from ſweate and payne. In this Age man followeth and purſueth Holy woorkes, louinge temperancie, vertue, &amp; Charitie, nowe ſéeketh he Honour by his honeſt deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,

               <p>The Seuenth and laſte, by order of theſe Ages conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth fully twentie yéeres, ending at the ende of eighty and eighte, whiche very fewe in our Age, either reache or attaine to. This Age, by the meane of <hi>Saturne,</hi> which ordereth it wholy (the moſte ſlowe, and moſte highe of al the other Planettes, whiche alſo enuironeth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth in all the others) is ſtoopinge, and decrepite. Wée in this Age are colde and drie, of complexion none other or better, then Melancoly, angrye, weamiſhe, harde to pleaſe, and enuious. By this meane wée lyue alone and ſolitarye: nowe alſo growe on vs, payne, griefe, ſorowe, thoughte, ſickneſſe, vnreaſte, diſdeigne, and anguiſhe. This Age weakeneth our force, and harmeth our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morye, it lodeth and chargeth vs with perpetual annoy, with longe ſorrowes, and languiſhinge diſeaſes: with déepe thoughtes, chiefly deſiringe to attempte cloſe and hidden Secretes: and in fine wée deſire principally to be Maiſters and Gouernours. And if any emonge vs paſſe nowe this Laſte Age (whiche aſſuredly happeneth very ſeldome in theſe dayes) the ſame then returneth to the ſtate, in manner of <hi>Infancie,</hi> and ones againe ſhall haue the <hi>Moone</hi> for his Ladye and Miſtreſſe, whiche ordered, as is aboue ſaide, the whole matter in the foure firſte yéeres: by reaſon whereof, theſe Aunciente and white headed Fathers ſhewe them ſelues none other, then lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Babes or Suclinges, wholy reſemblinge their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and qualities.

And for that in this diſcourſe, wée finde many thinges likinge vs, ſomethinge wil wée touche, to pleaſe therewith the Reader. The greate and Learned Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> howe longe ſo euer the Life of man ſéeme, leafte thereof to vs but foure partes onely, which he compared to the foure partes of the yéere. <hi>Infancie</hi> (he ſaide) reſembled the Springe, in whiche all thinges beganne to budde and flower, to growe, to waxe greate, and to comme to perfection. The youthfull Age of man, be compared to the Sommer, for the heate, force, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant courage that man hathe in that Age. The Age <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,</hi> or Mans ſtate, he compared to <hi>Autumne,</hi> for in that time hauinge experience of the worlde, he becommeth ripe, and ſounde of aduice &amp; counſel, with aſſured know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in all kinde of differentes. Olde Age reſembleth perfectly Winter, a time ſadde and enuious, and ſutche as reapeth no kinde of fruite or commoditie, onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyinge that, that wée receiue at other times. <hi>M. Varro,</hi> a <hi>Romaine,</hi> for his Vertue and Learninge, famous in his time: he parted the Life of Man into fiue ſundry &amp; equall partes, attributing to eche one, the whole &amp; full ſpace of fiftiene yéeres: in ſutche ſorte, that he called the firſte fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiene, <hi>Puerilitie:</hi> the Seconde, <hi>Adoleſcencie:</hi> to wéete, the time of growinge, for that man then ſpringeth vp to his full, and ſtayde ſtature. The Thirde Age reacheth to the fiue and fourtie yéere, whiche not vnaptly maie be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Youthe: in Latin, <hi>Iuuentus,</hi> comming; or deſcending of the Verbe <hi>Iuuo,</hi> ſignifiyng a fitte time to helpe or ayde in: for in this Age man beareth Armes in the fielde: he ſerueth, and defendeth with force his Countrie, and then only is he moſt hable in all exploytes of manhoode. From thence vntill the ſixtie yéere continueth the Age of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte Man. For that in Latin theſe men are called, <hi>Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores:</hi> that is to ſaie, beginninge to war alde, in reſpecte of the former Ages, for that in this time men firſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to decline, lookinge towardes Olde Age, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:12963:54"/>
haſteneth him onwardes, accompliſhinge the reſidue of Mannes Life, theſe firſte thrée ſcoare yéeres ended. This nowe then is <hi>Varro</hi> his diuiſion of Mannes Life, as wel collecteth, and reciteth <hi>Cenſorinus.</hi> The Philoſopher <hi>Hiporas</hi> into ſeauen: geuing ſeauen yéeres to the Firſt, and as many agayne to the Seconde, whiche both togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mounte to fourtiene. The Thirde from thence rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to the eighte and twentie yéere. The twoo nexte Ages folowinge haue eche againe ſeuen, whiche with the others by computation geue fourtie and twoo. The Sixte hathe fourtiene, and endeth with fiftie and ſixe: and that remaineth, what ſo euer it be, he referreth it to the Seuenth Age. <hi>Solon</hi> alſo, as the aboueſaide <hi>Cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> recordeth, diuideth theſe Seuen into Tenne, iuſtly ſunderinge the Thirde, the Sixte, and the Seuenth in the middle: in ſutche ſorte, that euery of theſe tenne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes conteine onely ſeuen yéeres, and no more. Theſe are the Diſtinctions of Ages then that wée finde emonge Philoſophers: ſauinge that <hi>Iſidorus,</hi> as alſo ſomme of the aboueſaide, diuide them onely into Sixe. Of whiche vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Firſte he geueth ſeuen yéeres, &amp; calleth that Age ſo, yonge and tender Infancie. The Seconde, to this in time, equall Puerilitie: from thence vntill the ende of the eighte and twentie yéere, he accoumpteth on the Thirde Age, and calleth it <hi>Adoleſcencye,</hi> a time wherein wée growe beſte, and reatche to perfection. The Fourthe is from thence vntill the ende of the fourtie yéere, whiche Age in Latin he calleth <hi>Iuuentus.</hi> The Fifte, to which he geueth the full ſpace of twentie yéeres, whiche with the others mounte vnto ſixtie. He noteth for the declininge Age, or if you rather will, the firſte entrie into Olde Age. The remanent of Mannes life, he attributeth to ſtoopinge Age, whiche howe mutche ſo euer it be, endeth only the laſte parte. <hi>Horace,</hi> a moſte excellent, and moſt renowmed Poete, diuideth this whole matter but into foure partes, as alſo did, as wée read, <hi>Pythagoras: In Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eritiam,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12963:54"/>
Iuuentutem, Aetatem Virilem, &amp; Senectutem:</hi> whiche he artificially deſcribeth in <hi>Arte Poetica,</hi> with all the conditions proper and incidente to theſe Ages. And yet according to the rules of natural Philoſophie, mans life is onely to be parted in thrée partes: The firſt is that time, that he hath to growe in: The ſecond while he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſteth and dwelleth at one ſtaie: The laſte when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth, and beginneth to ſtoope forewardes. For as ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> what ſo is ingendred, in the beginninge aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth <note place="margin">Lib. 3. De Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> and increaſeth, and afterwarde ſtayeth for a time, arreſtinge in his perfection, but in the ende decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and ſauereth of diminution. So that hence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, a tripartite diuiſion is not of the others all, leaſte proper or fittinge. Of this opinion alſo were the moſte parte of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Phiſitions, although <hi>Auicenna,</hi> a man of rare learninge, and of an excellent iudgement, hath lotted out mans time by foure diſtincte Ages. The firſt he calleth <hi>Adoleſcencie,</hi> the ful ſpace of thirty yéeres, for that, duringe that time man yet ſtill is growinge. To the ſeconde be geueth name, of a well ſtayde Age, or of an Age, wherein bewtie in all menne perfecteth: this parte continueth vntil the fiue and fortie yéere, in which wée liue ſeaſed of abſolute perfection. Nexte followeth the thirde, a ſecrete diminution, and priuie pathe vnto olde Age, whiche holdeth on fully the ſpace of fiftiene yéeres. Nowe order giueth vs in his place the laſte, a wery, a féeble, and an vnable Age, ſutche as men terme a Decrepite, or Caduke Age. Here muſte wée notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng note and conſider, that although it pleaſed him to geue vs this his quadripartite diuiſion, yet no where forbiddeth he vs to ſubdeuide agayne the firſte parte, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth, as wée ſaide, the ſpace of thirtie yéeres, lottinge the ſayde parte into thrée diſtincte partes, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Ages: by this meanes accordinge him with thoſe that before parte (as is remembered) the whole courſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>THe auncient Philoſophers and Aſtrologians, by diligent obſeruation, haue curiouſly noted certaine yéeres in mans life to be aſſuredly perilous, which in Latine they call <hi>Annos clymactericos,</hi> alludinge vnto the Gréeke woorde <hi>Clima,</hi> ſignifiynge as ſomme will, the ſtaffe of a Ladder, or a degrée in any thinge. Whence they note that theſe yéeres are in ſutche ſorte, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner limited, as are ſteares or ſteppes, that aunſweare by iuſte proportion in any thinge, very daungerous in the whole courſe and tracte of mans life. For as they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for an approued veritie, the ſeuenth, the nienth, and the fouretienth daie in all kinde of ſickneſſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, to be then the reſte continually more daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: in caſe ſemblable alſo eaſily perceiued they, that this accompte alſo by force of the numbers, had in like ſorte place in theſe odde yéeres, throughout the whole courſe alſo and time of our life. <hi>Pythagoras, Themiſtius, Boecius,</hi> and <hi>Auerrois,</hi> with others many, learne vs, that the influences of naughtie Planetes, as if I woulde ſaie of <hi>Saturne,</hi> whiche at ſeuerall times ruleth, and in ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ages, cauſinge greate chaunges and alterations e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſeuenth yéere, in ſutche ſorte, that themſelues felte the force thereof: as well remember <hi>Marſilius Ficinus, Cenſorinus,</hi> and <hi>A Gellius,</hi> ſuppoſinge it to be a thinge aſſuredly vnpoſſible, to paſſe thoſe yéeres without greate

hazarde or alteration of our life, eſtate, healthe, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. So that by this occaſion, the ſeuenth yéere, the fourtiene, the one and twentie, the eight and twentie, the fiue and thirty, the twoo and fortie, the niene and fortie, and ſo foorth by order euery ſeuenth yéere was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the others mutche to be feared. And farther for that they helde the number of thrée to be of greate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance or efficacie, they ſayde that thrée times ſeuen, whiche mounte to twentie one, was a number aboue all the reſte marueilouſly to be ſuſpected. As mutche againe is ſaide of the niene and fortie yéere, for that the number riſeth of ſeuen times ſeuen: But the moſte daungerous yéere of all others, is the thrée and ſixtie: for as twenty one riſeth of thrée times ſeuen, ſo ſixtie thrée mounte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of twentie one thrée times, or of niene times ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or ſeuen times niene: whiche numbers be famous, and as well knowen, ſo feared of the wiſe and learned. So that when they firſte entred the firſte daie of the ſaide yéere, they became (beyonde the woonted manner) very diligent, circumſpect and curious, to preſerue their healthe and life, by all practiſed polices taught vs, either by experience, nature, or Phiſicke, attendinge from daie to daie ſome daungerous mutation, or ſudden chaunge of ſtate, whiche in déede oftentimes hapneth, as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membereth <hi>Iulius Firmicus</hi> in his bookes of Aſtrologie. To this pourpoſe <hi>A.

In ſutch ſorte that he then intended to celebrate his ſecond Natiuitie. For theſe cauſes thenour Learned Predeceſſours mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilouſly feared this aboue rehearſed yéere, conſideringe that it was the fatall terme aſſigned by nature vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: duringe whiche time, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> with others renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and famous perſonages, died.

                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:12963:56"/>
remembered the number of niene to be perilous, ſo ſaide they, that who ſo paſte the ſixtie and thirde yéere, ſhould not at all eſcape the eightie and one yéere, for that, that yéere riſeth of nine times niene. At this Age died the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine <hi>Plato,</hi> the greate and Lcarned Geographer <hi>Eraſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes,</hi>

But theſe things more for experience ſake, and for that it ſéemeth vnto many a noueltie, haue I writen, then that any man ſhould hereon dwell ſo mutche, that he ſhoulde thinke it of neceſſitie, and a thinge ineuitable, although it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be not a matter impertinent, ne yet exiled from the lore of reaſon.

I demaunde of thée, right honourable, that if the Duke of which thou ſpeakeſt, were hence fallen into helle, where ſuppoſeſte thou this good Archbiſhop ſhould finde his quiet harbour. Where by he well inferred twoo contrary profeſſions, agréed not well in one perſone, and that offendyng in the

At whiche this gentleman, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently graueled, not hauyng what to ſaie, departed with ſhame to muche, and paſte forthe on his waie. To ſpeake alſo of Gentiles, Artaxerxes kyng of <hi>Perſia,</hi> vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng that a certaine capitaine of his, whiche he at his coſte, from his cradle, and infancie, had nouriſhed, had muttered againſt hym in maner, no leſſe traiterous, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in truthe diſloiall, whom he would other waie none pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe, but ſent to hym by an other, that he might at his pleaſure talke of his prince and maiſter, for that he again of hym might ſpeake, and do the ſemblable. Philippe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Alexander, aduertiſed that Nicanor had abuſed hym in woordes, was aduiſed by certaine his frendes, by proces (as the maner is) to call hym to his triall: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he aunſwered, that Nicanor was not the worſt man in Macedonie, and therefore firſte would knowe, whether he had nede of any thing, for that he felt hymfelf bounde in conſcience to aide hym: ſo findyng hym verie poore, in ſteede of deſerued correction, in preſence of many gaue him, a great, and riche preſent incontinently.

For as writeth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Economiques,</hi> the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of maners, and difference in conditions, let perfecte loue betwixte the parties coupled: &amp; yet neither approue I this ordinaunce of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whiche willeth that man ſhould haue twentie yeres more then woman (without offence, or preiudice be it ment, vnto ſo worthie a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage) my reaſon is this, that man beyng fullie ſixtie ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res olde, although he yet then can doe ſome thyng, in the acte of generation, moſte commonly if he liue longer, in the reſidue of his life, he is charged with infinite, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe of maladies, ſo that before his wife aſpire to the age of fortie, he to her ſhall bee a greate charge, and wearie paine, in place of a frende, a patrone, and a houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande. Wherefore when there is leſſe difference in their ages, thei are in like maner mortified as it were at one tyme, their mindes and intentes are alſo more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, then when there is ſo greate inequalitie of yeres Neither doe I here ſaie that man, ſhould not at all be el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but rather that the ſpace of eight, or ten yeres might ſuffice, ſo that the man at the age of twentie fiue, might chuſe to hym a wife, at ſixtene, or ſeuentene yeres, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng ſome reſpecte to the courſe, or order of mannes life. Alſo let man take to wife, a woman yonge, a maide, of perfecte, and good complexion, not olde, no widowe, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the maners, and humour of an other: for aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their tender youth, thei are flexible, and bendyng, to what ſo man would haue them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obedient, and ſubiect ſtill to his will, and pleaſure. To whiche purpoſe we maie remember here, thexample of <hi>Timotheus,</hi> on the Flut, of all others, moſte excellente and cunnyng, whiche for honeſte ſtipende, imperted of his ſkill, to ſuche as would learne of hym. This <hi>Timotheus,</hi> before he would begin

with any (whatſoeuer) his ſcholer, he vſually demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded if that he could plaie any thing, for of thoſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of beginnyng, he euermore receiued double wage or ſalerie: his reaſon was, for that his pain was alſo dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, firſt to make them forget, and forgoe, their firſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and diſordered vſe in plaie, and then a freſhe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructe them, accordyng to his ſkilfull loare. Whiche ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of his, well ſerueth vs for widowes, which are all readie trained to the peruerſe appetite ſome tyme, and fonde phantaſie of others, and therefore harde to bée drawen backe, from the wonted, and ſtraunge deuiſes, of their firſte friende, or houſebande. For whiche cauſe I preferre, the mariage of a maide, before that of a widow beſides the ſinguler affection, and aſſured remembrance, whiche commonly lieth rooted in the hartes of women, towardes theſe, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei firſt of all were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Concernyng the parentaige, or riches of the wife, a certaine yonge man, a Greke borne, came on a tyme to <hi>Pitacus,</hi> one of the ſeuen ſages of Grece, requeſtyng his aduiſe, in his affaires of marriage. One offered me ſaith he, my choiſe of twoo yonge maides, the one throughout myne equall, in ſubſtance, and in birthe, the other farre ſurpaſſeth me in worſhippe, and in gooddes, what ſhall I doe here in, whiche ſhall I chuſe to wife?

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt them, and thei ſhall giue thee good counſaile, whiche he did, and as he approched, and offered hymſelf for one, thei perceiuyng that bothe in force, and in ſtature of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, he paſte them, refuſed his companie, ſaiyng: that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man ſhould betake hym to his fellowe, and equall. Whence he well, knewe for wife, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhould take in marriage. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his treatiſe, of thinſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or brin gyng vp of children, willeth that manne marrie not his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, to a wife either more riche, or of better familie then he, ſaiyng, that who ſo alieth hymſelf, to his ſuperiours,
<pb facs="tcp:12963:64"/>
and betters, in place of frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and alies, he findeth none but maiſters. And farther if a riche woman, ſhall chuſe a houſebande poore, pride immediatly poſſeſſeth her, and miſtres muſte ſhe be, and ſowryng a lought continuallie with proude checkes will ſhe ſerue hym. And farther, <hi>Menander</hi> ſaieth, that who ſo beyng poore, and taketh to wife a woman riche, maketh a plaine gifte of hymſelf to the woman, whiche he eſpouſeth, and not ſhe vnto hym. <hi>Licurgus</hi> emong the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ordained a Lawe, that no man with his doughter, ſhould giue any kinde of dowrie, to th'intent thei trauailed, t'indowe themſelues with vertue, for that cauſe and none other, to be deſired in marriage. Although this lawe might ſeme now rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſome, yet aſſuredly was it bothe honourable, and neceſſarie, for beyng ones well obſerued in one, it likely alſo was, thai it ſhould bee in an other: as for example, if the father in marriage of his wife, was of no parte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richte, neither in gooddes, nor in money, he then the leſſe to his doughter, was bounde to impart with any thyng. Whence it lieth euident, that who ſo at any tyme, ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth into the ſacred lawes of wedlocke, ſhould haue if he well dooe, no conſideration at all of riches. But what? muche tyme ſhould I loſe, if I attempted to perſwade here, for that all men are ſoiled in this lothſome abuſe, wiueuyng for none other cauſe, but for pelfe onely. Yet ſaie I, notwithſtandyng, that when a riche man mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, he ſhould not conſider of the wealthe, or ſubſtance of the wife, but of her aſſured vertue, and modeſtie, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing fit example of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great (who though he were ſo famous, that all the worlde ſpake of hym) tooke yet to wife <hi>Berſina,</hi> the doughter of <hi>Arbaſus,</hi> not riche, or glitteryng, but vertuous onely, and deſcended of noble parentage: and yet in theſe daies, who ſo moſte hath, moſte buſily hunteth, and hungereth this droſſe. Hence cometh this often miſlikyng in marriage, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng withdrawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the money, that couereth, for the moſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12963:64"/>

Neither here miſlike I, that man in race like, or in like familie, ſeke to hym the beſt, or moſte fittyng to his apetite: as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, I thinke it bothe ignominious, and diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to matche in baſer ſtate, for the onely loue, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of money. It nedeth not that I herein long dwell, for the yearth it ſelf in this caſe, ſcholeth vs ſufficiently: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe who ſo pleaſe, ſeede fine and delicate, in a roughe ſoile, leſſe pleaſaunte, and vnlaboured, and he ſhall reape there of fruite, little daintie, and vnſauerie, yea, though it ſpring of a ſéede, as is afore ſaied, verie delicate: and on the other ſide, who ſo beſtoweth his ſeede leſſe ſauerie, in a ſoile fatte, and fertile, that whiche he thence repeth ſhall be ſwete, and delicate. Beſides, if we doe our care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paine, for the better prouition, of a good breede, or race of horſes, how muche the more ſhould we then bee circumſpecte, concernyng our children, our ſucceſſours, and poſteritie? In my phantaſie, that man maketh ſmall accompte of hymſelf, and euill ſatiſfieth that obligation, where vnto he is borne, if he leaue not his child, of as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a linage, as hymſelfe receiued, by diſſente from his father, whiche is impoſſible, if he take wife, of wourſe eſtate, or meaner condition, then hymſelf. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he accompte of honour, or haue it in reputation, he thence heapeth to his children more ample poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and greater dignitie, then hymſelf at the firſte, receiued from his father. How greate is mannes debte then, and what ſhould his care be, to leaue his children of no imba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed race, but rather to better it, if it be poſſible, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent his poſteritie, finde no cauſe to complaine them of. <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi> recordeth, that <hi>Maneſtias</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> ſoonne of <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> a moſte renoumed, and famous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaine, whoſe mother was of baſe, and vile condition,
<pb facs="tcp:12963:65"/>
whiche notwithſtandyng <hi>Iphicrates</hi> had eſpouſed, was demaunded, whom he beſte loued his father, or his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who aunſwered, his mother, where at thei mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailyng, demaunded againe why: for that my father, ſaid he, with ſmall regarde begatte me, of parte a <hi>Thracian,</hi> and ſoonne of á poore mother: but ſhe on the other ſide, hath borne me, of part an <hi>Athenian,</hi> the ſonne, and heire of an excellent capitaine.

My reaſon is, that wee ſhould alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the faireſte, if for none other, yet for generation, and cauſe of the poſteritie onely, to the intente our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, bee ſuche as we would wiſhe, of moſte perfecte, I meane, and amiable complexion. <hi>Virgil</hi> remembreth, that the goddes <hi>Iuno,</hi> deſirous to gratifie her beloued <hi>Eo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dus,</hi> promiſed to giue hym one of her faireſte <hi>Nimphes,</hi> to the ende ſhe ſhould beare hym, children in beautie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblyng her ſelf. We reade againe, that <hi>Archiadamus</hi> kyng of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> was condemned in a pecuniall paine, for that he had married a wife of ſmall ſtature, his counſaille hardly chargyng hym, that he mente to leaue the race roiall, of little, thinne, wretched, and impotente bodies, as if thei were but halfe men. To conclude, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what ſo is, in any place aboue remembred, mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe is, that it bee taken, as counſaile, and no commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which you maie execute at your pleaſures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daunger, or difficultie, as alſo without all exception of perſones.

ceremonies. The one was more common, and called her ſelfe matrone, the other more proper, and was named mother of the familie. As touchyng the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſorte, it maye eaſelie be thought that they ſo maried theym ſelues, as dooe in manner all Chriſtians in oure daies. For the huſbande would demaunde of his wife, whether ſhe would be mother, and ruler of his familie, and ſhe aunſweryng yea, would in caſe ſemblable alſo aſke hym whether hee mente to be father of her familie againe, to whom if he gaue affirmatiue aunſwere, then ſhould they take eche other by the hande immediatly, in token of aſſured faith, and amitie, and this contract was reputed for moſt perfect and excellent. By whiche mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the wife ſo gained ſuch place in the huſbandes houſe, as otherwiſe ſhe ſhould haue hadde, hadde ſhe been hys owne ſiſter, for that ſhe nowe came as by adoption, to be of the ſaide line, and as true doughter to her father in lawe, came to the inheritaunce at that inſtante with her huſbande. This gathereth <hi>Boecius</hi> at large, writyng on the ſeconde of the <hi>Topiques</hi> of <hi>Cicero.</hi> The other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie was muche more common, and therfore they were not reputed for mothers of the familie, thoughe they otherwiſe weere honoured by the name of matro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

Beſides all theſe an other thynge was yet practiſed by the <hi>Romaines,</hi> whiche was, when anie eſpouſed, or tooke to wife a Widowe, the mariage was ſolemnized euermore in a holie day, but if a maide, then contrariwiſe continuallie on a woorke daie.

the Sunne, the lightnynges alſo, and thunders, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the like, and ſemblable. His woorkes to conclude, were ſuche, and ſo excellent, that a certaine table of his, of parte by miſhappe ſtained (in whiche <hi>Venus</hi> was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied, as iſſuyng out of the ſea, whiche alſo <hi>Octauian,</hi> as an eſpeciall orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, did to be placed in the temple of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar)</hi> could neuer after bée mended, for none durſte bee ſo bolde, to take the thyng in hande, not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it to the firſt, and auncient paterne.

Beſides this, his happie witte was not onely ſéen, in his paſſyng ſkill of painting, but further, by his learned, and philoſophicall ſentences: for beyng commended of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togines,</hi> as one that farre excelled all others, in that his arte, aunſwered, you are quoth he <hi>Protogines,</hi> myne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, and my fellowe, onely one faulte you haue, that you neuer ſolace your ſelfe, foredulled with inceſſaunte with wearie toile, &amp; practiſe.

By whiche meanes afterwarde, vnkindly exiled, neither waxte he angrie, or greeued with his countrie, but contrariwiſe moſte quietly departynge, in preſence of the multitude, and before theim all ſaied: I praie the immortall Gods, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> neuer fall into any ſuch kinde of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, that they ſhoulde haue néede of, or deſire <hi>Ariſtides</hi> againe. And in déede ſo came it to paſſe, that within fewe daies afterwarde they repented theym of their folly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging with greate grief their faulte and errour: for before theſe ten yeres of his exile were expired, yea in the ſixte yere, by common conſent, and ſuffrage of the people, he was called home againe, to his perpetuall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but to their ignominie, &amp; the inexcuſable ſhame: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which his retourne, he did ſundry valiaunt, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie exploytes, beyng in perſon preſente, in that daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conflict, on the Sea adioyning to the Iſle <hi>Salamina,</hi> where <hi>Xerxes</hi> was vanquiſhed, as alſo preſente, at the ouerthrowe of <hi>Mardonius.</hi> So that as I firſte ſaied, thys lotte' of exile for the moſt parte ſtil fell on the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, <note place="margin">Mardonius was one of Xerxes Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</note> and moſt renoumed perſonages.

The reaſon why water boiled, ſhould therefore be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible, is for that it is not pure, and ſimple in his owne nature, but is all together mixt, bothe with the earth, and the aire: notwithſtandyng, the parte windie, as it eaſily reſolueth, by the fire into vapours, ſo that other ſubſtaunce alſo terreſtriall, by the ſaied vertue, or force of the fire (whoſe qualitie, is to trie, and diſioigne contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natures) deſcendeth to the bottome, and lower par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the veſſell. By whiche meanes, this boiled water romaineth leſſe vaporous, all the windie ſubſtaunce thereof perfectly conſumed: it alſo again is more ſubtile, and light, beyng this purified from the groſſe and ſtimie ſubſtaunce, and ſo conſequently more eaſie to be kepte, and conſerued, compitently refreſhyng, and moiſtyng the bodie, without any alteration, or opilation at all. Whence it is euidente, that theſe deepe welles, or tye pittes, giue none ſo good, and holeſome waters, as are the others, principally for that, the water more ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of ſome ſlimie nature, and that it is at no tyme, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by any ſhewe of the ſoonne, as that alſo it more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily putrifieth then any other. How bee it, the more that you drawe out of any ſuche Welle, the better, and the more profitable becometh the water, for that by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall motion, corruption leſſe ingendereth, and nothing
<pb facs="tcp:12963:86"/>
better fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> putrifaction preſerueth any water, then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, and inceſſante agitation: for ones corrupted, it impoiſoneth the newe waters, in their ſpringes theim ſelues, as letted or lackyng frée courſe or paſſage: but ſtil drawen, newe commeth on more freſhe ſtill, and ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For whiche cauſe the water of ſtanding pondes, and diches, is of all other moſte peſtilente, and venemous, whiche, for that it hardely ſpringeth, and hardely paſſeth thence againe, putrifieth, and ingendereth ſunderie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſoned matters, and ofte tymes (whiche worſte is) it corrupteth the aire, whence the inhabitauntes there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, are ordinarily infected. Conſider we alſo, that theſe waters, whiche flowe towardes the Southe, are not ſo holeſome, as thoſe that runne to the North: for the aire in the Southe, is more vaporous, and moiſte, whiche hurteth of parte, and impaireth the water: but in the Northe more ſubtile, and drie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the water is more light, and more voide of ill mixtions. For whiche cauſe, that water is euer more beſte, whiche is moſte cleare, moſte light, moſte ſubtile, and moſte purified, for it is, as we fore ſaied moſte free, from the mixtion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elementes, and beyng ſet ouer the fire, wareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo warme, and boileth before any other.

You ſhall take twoo peces of linen clothe, of

Other ſome haue vſed for their more expedition to waigh them in veſſeles pure, neate, cleane, in waight not differyng, with out any farther curioſitie at all. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> affirme, that the greateſt cauſe of diuers qualities in waters, is, and riſeth onelye of ſundrie ſubſtaunces, or maners of their ſoiles, by the meanes of Stones, Trées Mines, and Mettalles, through which theſe ſpringes or Riuers runne, and for this cauſe they become ſome hotte, ſome colde, ſome ſwéete ſome ſalte, ſome ſauerie, ſome leſſe ſauerie: wherefore it is a ſure, and an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule, that theſe waters that haue no taſte, ſmell, or ſauour, are continually reputed, for the moſte holſome, and beſte. Al ſuche notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng, as haue hereof wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, togither affirme, that theſe ſpringes, that paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe mines of gold, excell, without compariſon, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrées the others: for proofe whereof, theſe riuers are accompted moſte worthie of all others, whiche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender and preſerue gold in their fine, and ſmall ſandes: but becauſe we perticulerly, ſome thyng haue ſaied of the proprietie of ſpringes, and riuers, we leaue here to wearie the reader with examples. Now then, ſith ſome thynges haue been ſpoken of fountaines, and flouddes, it followeth that we conſequently treate of rainie wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whiche of ſome are reputed for verie ſoueraigne, and medicinable, but of others ſome accompted leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable, or neceſſarie. <hi>Vitruuius</hi> and <hi>Columella,</hi> with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other Phiſitians, highly commende all rainie wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but theſe eſpecially that are receiued cleane, pure, without any kinde of groſſe, or terreſtriall ſubſtaunce:
<pb facs="tcp:12963:87"/>
for that of them ſelues, ſaie thei, theſe waters, are light, and voide of all mixtion, cauſed onely of vapours, which by their onely ſubtilitie, are taken vp into the aire, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, as maie bee ſuppoſed, all impure, or ſlimie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce behinde theim. Some neuertheleſſe, ſaie, that this water, deſcendyng in this ſorte from aboue, prutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth incontinently, as is to bée ſeen in ſtandyng pooles, or diches, whiche ingender infinite ordures. How bee it, to ſpeake indifferently, this is not to be attributed, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny defaute, or imperfection in this water, but rather for that it is reſerued in ſo vile a place, into whiche moſte commonly flowe, all noiſome ſinckes, and vnſauerie gutters, with others of that ſorte, leſſe meete to bée here remembred, as alſo of parte, by the ordure, that it dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, and bryngeth with it, waſhyng the yearth, as it floweth into the aboue ſaied troughes, or diches, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when it powreth doune, or raineth aboundauntlie. Wherefore, the cauſe of this ſodaine corruption, of part procedeth from the extreme heate of the Sunne, of part for that it is ſo pure, and delicate, but mixte now with ſuche contagious, and lotheſome impurities, that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, and without ſtaie, corrupteth of neceſſitie. Notwithſtandyng, if this water ſo ſubtile, and well pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, were taken, fallyng from houſes, voide of duſte, or filthe, or rather before it touche any houſe, or other thing, were receiued into ſonie cleane, and pure veſſell, it maie be thought, that it would proue, more pure then any other, as alſo that it longer might bee, without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction preſerned. Others ſome there are, that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme the contrary, as <hi>Plinie</hi> that writeth it to bee <note place="margin">Plinie in his 32. boke, and third chapiter.</note> nought, and vnholeſome, who alſo commaundeth, that we neither drinke, or taſte of it, for that theſe vapours, whence it in the beginnyng, and firſte of all riſeth, iſſue, and procede of diuerſe thynges, as alſo of diuerſe ſoiles, whence it alſo receiueth diuers, and different qualities, good, and badde, with like, and with the ſame facilitie.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:12963:87"/>
And againe alleagyng ſome farther proofe, for his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, anſwereth alſo to that, that we aboue remembred, leſſe admitting it for comprobation ſufficient, as to ſaie, that it therfore is pure, or light, becauſe it is drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the regions of the aire, whether it (as is euidente) not naturally mounteth, but is taken by ſecrete force, and violency of the ſunne. Neither are theſe vapours, ſaieth he, which in the middle regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the aire, by extreme cold are altered into haile, or ſnowe, ſo pure, and ſo perfecte, as moſt men ſuppoſe them, but reſolued into water, are rather founde in verie deede peſtiferous, and noiſome. Beſides whiche defecte, he this againe addeth, that this rainie water, by the onely euaporation, and heate of the yearth, becommeth infected, euen in the ſame tyme, and inſtante that it raineth. For better proofe of whiche im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puritie, it onely is to bee noted, how quickly, and how ſone, it becometh putrified, of whiche wee haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, often tymes vpon the ſea, where it impoſſible is, to preſerue, ſuche waters from corruption.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Riſtotle</hi> writeth, as alſo <hi>Plinie,</hi> that we ſhoulde frame certaine veſſels of waxe, hollowe within, ſo bindyng, or cloſing theim, that in theim, be founde no hole, or vente, lettyng theim doune into the Sea, faſtned in ſome Nette, or other fitte matter, with long lines, or cordes, whence, (after they there haue béen the ſpace of one whole daie) if wée againe drawe theim, wee ſhall finde in euerie of theim a certaine quantitie of freſhe water, ſuche, and ſo good, as in any ſpring, or fountaine. The reaſon why the ſalte water becometh freaſhe, by the entraunce into theſe veſſels, is in thys ſorte geuen vs of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who ſaieth, that the waxe beyng a bodie both full of powres, and ſwéete, graunteth paſſage to the moſt pure and ſubtill parte of the water, which as it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth without hys groſſe, and ſaulte ſubſtaunce, ſo pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it ſauereth of the waxie nature, ſwete and pleaſant. In truthe if it be ſo, (I ſaie againe, if it bee ſo, for that I neuer yet practiſed in any ſorte, this ſecrette) it might well ſerue in ſundrie our neceſſities, whiche commonly betyde vs, in infinite our affaires. How be it, I ſuppoſe, that if thys falte water waxe freaſhe by the onely and ſole enteraunce, in to the aboue ſaide veſſels, the ſaied veſſels in like ſorte, filled alſo full with the Sea, ſhoulde

The reaſon ſeemeth one, as tending both to one ende, vnleſſe we ſhould dwell here, on ſome ſcrupulous difference, arguing that by the ſame meane: and by the ſame facillitie, this freaſhe water di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilleth not out, of the full veſſell, as on the other ſide it entereth, into the voyde, and emptie: for that ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearaunce is, of greater force, in goyng out, then is (as ſome ſuppoſe) at the entraunce, or comyng in: how be it, who ſo curious is, may make eaſie proofe, both of the one &amp; the other. Farther for their ſakes, that pleaſe in theſe experimentes, one other thynge ſhall I write, in thys place not leſſe neceſſarie. Who ſo filleth at anye tyme twoo Bottles of one meaſure, the mouth, &amp; necke, of like length, and widnes, the one with boilyng water, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all colde, and ſtraigh waies will empte theim, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one ſorte, without gile (at one tyme, I meane, and in one inſtante tegether) ſhall finde that the colde water will, as well be firſt out, as alſo that in fallyng, it aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly will yelde a greater brute, or noyſe: the boylynge water ſlidyng, on the other ſide, ſlowly and with leſſe noyſe. The reaſon is, that the warme water leſſe poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth then the colde, whiche by heate of the fier, hath loſte nowe the greateſt quantitie of his groſſe vapours: ſo that when firſte the colde water beginneth to ſtreame forthe, that parte that is behinde ſtill, by his weight pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, and thruſteth on the former, by continuall force, or fight as it were, in ſuche ſorte, that the onely weight firſte cauſeth the colde Bottle to empte, as alſo by the ſame meane, it noiſeth as is euident, or reſoundeth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farther.

Some ſuppoſe that he was a <hi>Parthian</hi> borne, a people leſſe honorable, then dread of the <hi>Romaines:</hi> his farher and mother, were verie poore, and néedie: he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding was of honeſt &amp; vertuous conditions, wel fewtred, valiant, healthie, quicke &amp; nimble, ſharpe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo, of ripe, and mature deliberation, and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, imaginyng, and deuiſing, haute and greate enterpriſes, euen in that his moſt, and extreame penurie, as though he ſome times ſhoulde be a maiſter of many thinges.

After this othe then, in ſolemne ſorte miniſtred, he charged eache of theim forthwith to ſell their troope and cattell,

leauing this ſeruile and baſe trade of life, ſéeking to ſerue in warre, acceptyng hym for capitaine: whiche in deede they did, beyng quickly aſſembled of other worke men, and paſtours, to the full number, at leaſte, of fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: with whom the firſte attempte that euer be tooke in hande, was that they robde all ſuche marchauntes as anie where paſte nigh theim, and after he imparted the ſpoyle ſo iuſtlie, that all his companions ſerued hym, with no leſſe faithe then loue, and loyaltie, whiche occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ſundrie others, a newe to ſeeke, and followe hym. Of whiche newes in the ende, the Kinge of <hi>Perſia</hi> aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, ſent forth vnder the conducte of one, of his capitai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, a thouſande horſes well appointed to apprehende and take hym: at whoſe commyng, he ſo well knewe in this matter howe to beare hym, that of his enimie he ſoone had made hym, his aſſured frende, and companion: in ſuche ſorte that they ioigned both their companies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, attempting, then before, enterpriſes much more greate, and more difficill.

And although we finde written no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, of any his warres whatſoeuer, yet is it to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he fought many a bataile in open filde with the ennimie, before he had ſubdued ſo many, kingdomes and territories: for as muche as all thoſe that remember of hym anie thyng, commende to vs the haute exploytes, of this moſte valiaunte perſonage, and farther that hee ſo circumſpectly ordered his companie, that in his Campe was neuer knowen, any brawle, or mutenie. He was verie courteous, liberall, doyng honour to all menne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to their demerites that woulde accompanie, or follow him, feared therefore equally, and loued of the people. He ſo painefullie, and with ſuche care inſtructed his Souldiars, that in an inſtante alwaies, if it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houefull, either by ſounde of Trompette, or any other, one, onely ſigne geuen, euerie man was founde in his charge, or quarter, yea though his armie were ſutche, ſo greate, and ſo numerous, as neuer beſides him ſelfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted anie other.

Wherefore marchyng on within fewe daies, they mette eache with other vppon the confines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> where both of theim orderyng as became good Capitaines their people, beganne in the

breake of day, the moſt cruell, and moſt terrible battaile that earſt was euer harde of, conſideryng the nomber on both partes, their experience, &amp; pollicie, with the valiant currage, and prowes of their capitaines. This continued they in fighte euen almoſte vntill night, with meruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſloughter on bothe ſides, the victorie yet doubtfull, til, in the ende the Turkes beganne to fainte and to flée, more in déede oppreſt with the multitude, then that thei feared or other wiſe, the moſte parte of theim with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour diyng manfully in the filde: and as one reporteth two hundred thouſand were taken priſoners, after the battaile was ended, the reſude ſlaine, and fledde for their better ſafetie.

Wherefore, let it not ſeme ſtraunge, or incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to any, that whiche, wée haue here tofore recited: for this elemente of water is very puiſſaunte, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous, whoſe force, and hidden qualities, are not to all men, ſo familiar, and well knowen. As concernyng the ſea alſo, it is reported to bée in Winter, more warme then in the Sommer, as againe more ſalte in Autumne then in other tymes any. Moſte true it is alſo, that in ſome partes of the ſea, to weete, in thoſe that bée farreſt of, from the lande, no ſnowe falleth, at any tyme, what ſo euer. Of all theſe thynges, ſundrie haue giuen ſundrie good reaſons, of whiche, the greater parte, attribute it, to th'onely proprietie, or qualitie of the ſoile, mines, ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, trees, and mettalles, where fountaines haue their ſprynges, where riuers, and lakes runne. For better proofe whereof, that it ſo is in déede, by daiely experience

we well are inſtructed, that vines, and other fruictes, of one, and the ſame kinde; are more better, and more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery in one ſoile, then in another, for that ſome are ſwete ſome ſharpe and ſower, ſome good and profitable, others againe infectious, and noiſome.

a man prudente and wiſe, and well knowen to many of you, that his father, on a tyme commyng, by the ſea to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes Italie, and paſſyng on a night, by a certaine Iſle called <hi>Paraxis,</hi> euen when all in the Shippe were then ſtill, and quiete, thei heard a greate, and dreadfull voice, whiche ſrom the Iſle called to them, <hi>Ataman, Ataman,</hi> (ſuche was the pilotes name of the ſhippe, an Egiptian borne) &amp; although this voice were ones, and againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode by <hi>Ataman,</hi> yet was he not ſo hardie, to frame to it an annſwere, vntill the third time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid who is there? what is it that calleth me? what wouldeſt thou haue? To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this voice again, more louder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, ſaied: <hi>Ataman,</hi> my will is, that when thou paſſeſt by the goulfe, which hath to name <hi>Laguna,</hi> that thou there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <note place="margin">Laguna.</note> to crie out, and certifie the ſaid goulfe, that the greate God <hi>Pan</hi> is deade. Whiche vnderſtoode, all thoſe that were in the ſhippe, feared, counſailyng the ſaied pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote, to leaue vndooen his charge, neither any thyng to arreſte, or ſtaie at the goulfe, eſpecially if the winde would ſerue them to paſſe further: but approchyng nigh the place, of whiche this voice, admoniſhed hym, the ſhip arreſted, and the ſea waxte calme, not hauyng winde to paſſe preſently any farther: by meanes whereof, thei generally concluded, that <hi>Atman</hi> ſhould there dooe his legation, or imbacie, whiche the better to doe, he moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp into the poupe, or hinder parte of the ſhip, where he crieth as loude, as he could poſſible, ſaiyng: I will that ye knowe, that the greate God <hi>Pan</hi> is deade: whiche woorde, as ſone as he ones had vttered: thei heard incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, ſuche terrible lamentations, and cries, houling and complainyng, aboue that maie be ſaied: in ſuche ſort that the ſea it ſelf reſounded theſe complaintes, whiche continued moſte dolorous, and lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table a great while: by meanes whereof the Mariners, though meruailouſly afraied, hauyng the winde good againe, followed their courſe, &amp; arriuyng at Rome, made rehearſal of this their,

aduenture. Whereof the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and deſirous to be certified of the truthe, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, founde to conclude, as is aboue rehearſed. Whence it is euident, that the deuilles euery where ſorowed the natiuitie of our Sauiour, and redemer Chriſte, for that he was onely their ruine, and deſtruction. For by iuſte, and true ſupputation of tyme, we finde that this happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at the tyme of his Paſſion, or perhaps, ſome thyng before, then I meane, whe he baniſhed, and exiled them, out of the worlde. It is to be preſuppoſed, that this great God <hi>Pan</hi> (accordyng to the immitation of <hi>Pan,</hi> the God of Shepherdes) whiche thei ſaied was deade, was ſome capitaine, and maiſter deuill, whiche at that tyme loſte his Empire, as did alſo the others. Beſides all theſe <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> writeth, that at the ſame tyme was heard in the temple of Hieruſalem, a voice (though in déede ther was no liuyng creature with in) whiche lamentably cried, and ſaied thus, let vs goe hence, and leaue this countrie in haſte, as who would ſaie, thei truely knewe, that the tyme of their paine, and perſecution was at hande, and that it drewe on faſte, euen by the death of hym, that gaue life vnto others. In the Goſpell of the <hi>Nazarites</hi> it is reade, that in the daie of his Paſſion, that ſumptuous gate of their Temple, whiche thei neuer lefte for any coſte, to adorne, and beautifie, fell doune to the grounde, and was vtterly defaced. Conſider now in that daie, what ſtraunge, and meruailous thynges happened, though the Euangeliſtes haue paſte theim, as thynges leſſe worthie memorie. The eclipce alſo of the Sunne, whiche continued thrée howers, the full ſpace in deede, that Chriſt was on the croſſe, was not naturall, as are the others, whiche by th'onely coniunction of the Sunne and Moone chaunce vs, but was miraculous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the courſe, and order of nature. Suche therefore as leſſe knowe how the Sunne is eclipſed, muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that it onely happeneth, by coniunction of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
<pb facs="tcp:12963:102"/>
ſaied bodies, the Mooue paſſyng, or goyng betwixt the Sunne, and the yearth: neuer the leſſe, this eclipſe happened, in th'oppoſition of theſe planettes, the Moone then full, and hundred and eightie degrées, diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, in the vnder hemiſphere, then at the citée of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: for proofe whereof, beſides the teſtimonies of infinite good writers, the ſcriptures them ſelues, record it manifeſtly: for certain it is, that the lambe was neuer Sacrificed, but in the .xiiij. of the Moone, whiche Lambe was eaten by Chriſt, and his diſciples, but one daie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before his death, as is commaunded in the .xij. of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, in Leuiticus alſo the xxiij. And the nexte daie follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng, whiche was the daie of vnleauened bread, Chriſt the Lambe vnſpotted, was vnkindly crucified, the Moon then of neceſſitie in her full, and oppoſite to the Sunne, whiche then could no more eclipſe the Sunne, then any other Planete. It then was to conclude miraculous, and contrary to the order of nature, doen onely by the onmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potente, and ſole power of GOD, whiche depriued the Sunne of light, for that thrée howers ſpace. By occaſion whereof, that worthie perſonage <hi>Denis Areopagita,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time preſente at <hi>Athens,</hi> and beholding in this ſorte, the Sunne to be obſcured, and knowyng on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, as a learned <hi>Aſtrologian,</hi> that this eclipſe was contrary to the order of natue, ſaied openly with a loude voice, to bée heard of all menne: either the frame of the worlde ſhall bée diſſolued, either the God of nature pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſuffereth. For whiche cauſe, as one reporteth, the ſages of <hi>Athens</hi> ſtraungely diſturbed, did to bee builte incontinently, an aulter, to the God vnknowen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afterward ſaincte Paule arriuyng, learned theim, who was that God vnknowne, and that he was Jeſus Chriſt, God and man, our redemer, whiche then, and at that tyme, ſuffered for our ſaluation: by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he conuerted, greate numbers to the faithe. Some neuer the leſſe haue doubted, whether this defecte were
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12963:102"/>
generall, and vniuerſall throughout the worlde, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng here on, though the Euangeliſt ſaieth, that it was ſynne vpon the whole face of the yearth, that, that was onely, but a phrace, or maner of ſpeache, as muche to ſaie as in all the countrie there about, of whiche opinion was that learned doctour <hi>Origen:</hi> but what? Wee ſée that in Grece, yea, in <hi>Athens</hi> it ſelf, this defecte of the Sunne was perceiued of all men, whiche leadeth me to ſuppoſe, that it was generall, to bée ſeen, and conſidered through out our whole hemiſphere, in what place, or where ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Sunne that tyme appered. Whiche I therefore ſaie, for that in all the other hemiſphere, where it then was night, no man could ſée any thyng, no ſhe we then of the Sunne at all there, for at one tyme he onely ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the halfe worlde, the other he obſcureth with his owne proper ſhadowe. How bee it, the Moone then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng in her fulle, not hauyng any other lighte, then that, whiche ſhe taketh or borroweth of the Sunne, and yet then beyng in the hemiſphere, whiche is vnder vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came alſo to bee vehemently eclipſed, and darkened, by th'onely want of the light, and ſhe we of the Sunne. By which meanes, an vniuerſall ſhadow, couered the whole yearth, the Moone, and ſtarres, not able to giue other light, then that whiche the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues receiue of the Sunne.</p>

Theſe then are the wordes of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> whiche wrote of the ruine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> a witnes preſente in perſon, at that ſubuerſion, whiche chaunſed full fortie yeres after the paſſion of our redemour. <hi>Pilate</hi> in like ſorte whiche gaue ſentence of death againſt him, witneſſeth in maner ſemblable of his meruailous miracles, of whiche by hys letters he certified the Emperour <hi>Tyberius,</hi> by meanes wherof he conſulted with the <hi>Senate,</hi> to know whether they would admitte <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſte, to be reuerenced, and adored for God, and although they woulde, in no wiſe there vnto accorde, yet <hi>Tyberius</hi> of hymſelf ſtreatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, that no man ſhoulde be ſo hardie, to touche, or greue a Chriſtian. As concernyng the yearthquake, and darknyng of the Sunne, continuyng the full tyme that Chriſt was on the Croſſe, we haue alſo good teſtimonies and aſſured of <hi>Ethnikes. Flegon</hi> a gréeke hiſtoriogripher, borne in <hi>Aſia,</hi> of whom <hi>Swydas</hi> eſpecially remembreth, reporteth for a thing almoſt incredible, that in the forth yere, of the two hundred and tenth <hi>Olympiade,</hi> whiche by iuſt accompte was in the eightinth yere of the raigne of <hi>Tyberius,</hi> at whiche tyme our ſauiour ſuffered, there
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12963:104"/>
was a greate Eclipſe of the Sunne, ſuche as earſte had neuer been ſéen, or written of, continuyng from the ſixt hower, euen vnto the ninth, and farther during the time of this defect of the Sunne, ſuch and ſo inſpekable, were the yearthequakes in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Bithinia,</hi> that infinite houſes fell doune to the grounde. It appeareth farther, that beſides this <hi>Flégon</hi> that in the ſame time liued, <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> alſo felte it, and diſcourſed on the ſaide matter, for ſaieth he in the tyme of Themprour <hi>Tyberius,</hi> greater yearth quakes were then ſeen, then euer had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by meanes of whiche were ſubuerted twelue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous cities in <hi>Aſia,</hi> with infinite and innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houſes, and buildynges: in ſuche ſort that the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riogriphers Gentiles, though leſſe wéetyng the cauſe, lefte not yet to write the miracles of Chriſt. The other miracle of the veale of the Temple that ſundred, <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> in like ſorte recordeth it faithefully. The cruell murther dooen by <hi>Herode,</hi> vppon the harmeleſſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes, is writen, of on other Iewe, whiche hight <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> an hiſtorian of greate aucthoritie, in his abridgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of tyme, where he thus muche reporteth, that <hi>Herode</hi> did to bee murthered certaine yong infantes, and with them alſo his owne naturall ſoonne, for that he heard ſay that Chriſt, the king promiſed to the Iewes, was borne and this man liued in the tyme of <hi>Herode</hi> the <hi>Tetrarche,</hi> as him ſelfe writeth. This hiſtory of the innocentes, is of <hi>Macrobius</hi> alſo, more fully remembred, a man excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlie learned and of greate antiquitie, who in reherſall of certaine pleaſant, and merie conceites of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Octauian</hi> (aboute the tyme of the birth, or natiuitie of our ſauiour) whiche ſaied, beyng aduertiſed of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of <hi>Herode,</hi> as well towardes hys owne ſoonne, as alſo the others, that he rather would be a Hogge in the houſe of <hi>Herode,</hi> then his ſoonne, whiche he ſaied for that the Iewes did neuer eate any ſwines fleſhe, whiche pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ieſte is repeted by <hi>Dion</hi> in the life of the ſaide Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,

ſo that in fine there were many miracles, written as wel by Iewes, as by Gentiles leſſe ſuppoſing to haue witneſſed them, to haue been doen by Chriſte, beſides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite the others reported by Chriſtians. What farther ſhall I write of the auncient Emperours, and what thei thought of our faith, as what diſcourtiſies they alſo pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, againſt the true profeſſors of Chriſt, and his truth? The firſt good Biſhoppe or ſeruaunt of Chriſt S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paule</hi> alſo a faithfull miniſter, were doen to death at the commaundement of the Emperoar <hi>Nero,</hi> thirtieſix yeres after the death of our redemour, at whiche tyme was the greate perſecution of the Churche, of whiche the Gentiles left not to make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as among others many, theſe twoo eſpecially, <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius Tranquillus,</hi> whiche liued at that tyme, bothe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and honourable. <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the life of <hi>Nero,</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of certaine his owne ordinaunces, faieth that hee tormented, and afflicted with ſundry and greuous puiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, a certaine kinde of people whiche called theim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Chriſtians, folloyng a newe faith or religon. And <hi>Cornelius T.</hi> writyng of the ſaied <hi>Nero,</hi> affirmeth, that he chaſtiſed and purſued with terrible tormentes, a ſort of people, named commonly Chriſtians, the author of whiche name ſaieth he, was Chriſt of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> the verie ſame, whiche <hi>Pilate</hi> gouernour of <hi>ludea,</hi> did openly to be crucified, by whoſe death his doctrine grewe more and more, and increaſed. But conſider wee alſo what ſome other Gentiles haue written, of honour, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie like vnto the others. <hi>Plinie</hi> the yonger, in one of his Epiſtles, demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth of the Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> whoſe Liuetena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he was in <hi>Aſia,</hi> how he would that he ſhould puniſhe the Chriſtians, that were aceuſed, and brought before hym: and the better to informe his Lorde of what ſoeuer he founde againſt them, he among other thinges many reporteth, that theſe Chriſtians riſe ordinarilie, at certaine houres of the night, aſſembling, and meetyng

together, ſingyng Hymmes, and Songes of praiſe vnto <hi>Ieſus Chriſte,</hi> whom they honoured for their God and <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and beſides this meetyng in congregations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they made alſo vowes not to doe annoie, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to anie, not robbyng or takyng from any manne what ſo euer, that they would not committe adulterie, that thei neuer woulde falſe their faith, or promis, not to denie, what ſoeuer had been lent theim, or committed to their kepyng. And farther the ſaide <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth, that they alwaies did feede, or eate together, not holding or poſſeſſyng any thyng, as proper or priuate. By theſe are well knowen, what were euen then, the exerciſes of the chriſtians, as alſo for what cauſe the worlde purſued theim. Thoſe thinges were recorded thus by an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous infidell, ſixtie yeres fullie after the Paſſion of our Lorde and ſauiour. Vnto whiche letters the Emperour aunſwered, for as muche as thei were accuſed of no kind of riote, or wrong, he ſhould in no wiſe afflict, or chaſtice theim; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How be it, true it is, that this ſaied Emperour <hi>Traian,</hi> before this as an infidell, and deceaued by the guile, and fraude of the accuſers, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed both, and perſecuted, the poore harmlis chriſtians.

The vanitie of this people was ſuche then, and ſo aucthoriſed, that they yet had alſo an other Image of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſemely bearded, imaginyng all thoſe, that had her in eſpeciall adoration, ſhoulde haue verie faire beardes, well coloured, and well growen: but thoſe that diſdained her, or none at all, or the contrarie. All theſe thinges did they for diuerſitie of reſpectes, and conſiderations in her: and withall to ſignifie her omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, or power, which they déemed all ſhe had, purtraiyng her in ſundrie, and diuers ſortes a goddeſſe.

Some others againe of fine, and brittle glaſſe, becauſe ſhe was ſo fickle, with out all holde or ſtaie. Others alſo depainted her turnyng of a wheele, on the higheſt parte of which, ſome preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were placed, ſome alſo were climbyng, as thoug they would get vp, ſome alſo fallyng into ruine, and diſpaire. One alſo reſembleth her, not vnaptly to a Commedie, in whiche ſome enter at tymes, with countenance, of kinges, and greate Perſonages, and ſtreight againe chaungyng their habite, or apparell, put on the faces, or countenaunces of bondmenne, for that in this life, wée haue none other ſuretie, to daie to liue in pompe, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe in ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cke beggerie. <hi>Socrates</hi> compared her to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place, or theater without order, where commonly it happened, the worthieſt in déede, to be eftſones worſt placed.

For iuſt cauſe did our elders, depainte For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune blind, for continually ſhe giueth, to the leſſe vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and vnhoneſte, neuer for his demerites, preferryng any perſone, voide of all election, or diſtinction of menne for vertue, aduauncyng the ribaulde, and the graceleſſe tretcherer, whom if ſhe had iyes to beholde, or to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhe then would flie in haſte, from theſe her accurſed dearlynges. Infinite is the number of aucthorities, that might be alleaged, concernyng the names, or titles, that haue béen of many aſſigned vnto Fortune. <hi>Valerius,</hi> and <hi>Claudian,</hi> letted not to call her diſpitefull, and enuious: <hi>Ouidius</hi> in <hi>faſtis,</hi> right mightie and puiſſaunte, but in his

Epiſtles, accurſed, and diſpitefull. <hi>Iuuenall</hi> in his <hi>Satires</hi> froward, and peruerſe. <hi>Lucian</hi> traiterous, and periured. <hi>Siluius Italicus,</hi> falſe, and ſubtile. <hi>Virgill</hi> in one place na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth her omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and almightie, but in others again inconſtaunte, vnfaithfull, and diſloiall. <hi>Cicero</hi> of whom we alſo aboue ſome thing remembred, who alſo then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted her, a Princes moſte of might, and guide alſo to them that would, or did liue iuſtly, ſaieth that nothing is ſo contrary to reaſon, and to conſtancie, as is theſame Fortune. And yet for all this, the vanitie of the auncient <hi>Romaines,</hi> was ſuche, and ſo greate, that thei ſtil adored her, whom thei knewe to bee blinde, falce, inſtable, and inconſtaunte, dedicatyng to theſame, bothe ſumptuous, and coſtly Temples, vowyng theim ſelues, ſo buſily, to theſe ſuperſtitions, that the Emperours theim ſelues, had euermore the Image of Fortune, in their ſleapyng chambers. But when any of theim died, the ſame was then tranſported into the chamber of his ſucceſſor. The firſte that framed a Temple, to Fortune in <hi>Rome,</hi> was <hi>Seruius Tullius,</hi> as recordeth <hi>Liue,</hi> the ſixte kyng by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and iuſte accoumpte of the <hi>Romaines:</hi> though <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarche</hi> in his booke of the fortune of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that it was <hi>Marcius</hi> the fowerth kyng there, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che framed as is euidente, a Temple to virill Fortune. <hi>Seruius</hi> notwithſtandyng, gaue Fortune all theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, to witte, of valiaunte Fortune, little Fortune, proſperous Fortune, aduerſe Fortune, triumphaunte Fortune, with others more, ſuche, to theſe the like, and ſemblable, to euery of whiche, he dedicateth a parte, a riche, a faire and aſumptuous temple. The firſt of virile or rather valiaunte Fortune, ſtoode nigh vnto <hi>Tyber,</hi> where all yonge maidens, that were of age mariagable, came to offer their preſentes, with all reuerence, and deuotion: in whiche Temple thei alſo did of all their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, all naked, ſaue their ſmocke, before this Idoll of Fortune, diſcoueryng their me heames, and eche their

In fine, then muſt we thinke, that all theſe vanities, with many others the ſemblable, whiche maie in this place bée remembred, to this purpoſe, was a plain illuſion, and deception of men, walkyng in darkeneſſe, affiyng, and truſtyng in their owne proper wiſedome.

And againe, though many of vs bee founde, of ſo groſſe a féelyng, or vnderſtandyng, that wee either hardly, or not at all perceiue, the increaſe, or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of thynges, not to be of Fortune, but that what ſo euer is, or any waie multiplieth, the ſame to iſſue, and procede from the principall, firſte, and chief cauſe God, maker, creatour, and gouernour of all, whiche for an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured veritie, we muſte acknowledge, and imbrace, that would, or doe deſire, to be numbred for Chriſtians. <hi>Lact.

This then muſte we beleue, that what ſo euer is, or any where hath his beyng, that the ſame bothe is, and proceadeth ſtill from God. Farther alſo, beſides that ſundrie our elders, had ſome feelyng in this matter. <hi>Saluſte</hi> alſo ſawe it, and boldly therefore pronounced, that eche man was the firſte, and principall cauſe of his fortune, and in his proheme, of his warre of <hi>Iugurthe,</hi> ſaieth: that the ſlothfull, and negligent perſon, complaineth ſtill of Fortune, but without any iuſte cauſe, or reaſon. <hi>Iuuenal</hi> more plainly in his tenth <hi>Satire</hi> affirmeth that where aduice is, there Fortune ſtill exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, though wée repute her for a goddeſſe, and lodge her in the heauens. Other Philoſophers were there, whiche though thei alſo affirmed, that Fortune of her ſelf, could in deede doe nothyng, beleued it notwithſtandyng, that ſhe was an inſtrument, or aide, to the diuine prouidence, as if God ſhould ſtande in nede of ſome other, to aſſiſte hym: whiche is no leſſe vaine, then the opinions aboue rehearſed, and alſo others ſome, that in this place might be remembred, whiche I all leaue, as alſo to be tedious, onely paſſyng in fewe, there by yet to admoniſhe the ignoraunte, and ſimple Chriſtian what ſo euer, that he forſake his fonde, and fooliſhe cuſtome, to gréeue, or to miſlike at any tyme with Fortune, when any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tideth hym, contrary to his expectation. For in fine, this muſt we knowe, that God diſpoſeth mannes affaires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to whom, and to none other, in euery our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we muſte appeale, and crie, for his aſſiſtaunt grace and ſuccour.</p>

                  <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Whiche is verified by the aucthoritie of <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſaiyng, that the nephewes of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſones of <hi>Seth,</hi>

Notwithſtanding according to the opinion of al men, the firſt writers had no kinde, or maner of Paper, but wrote continually on the leaues of the Date tree, whence came that worde of leaues of bookes vſed at this daie. After this thei wrote againe on the rindes of trées, but eſpecially on thoſe that moſt eaſely were drawen, or taken from the trée, as the Elme, the Aſhe, the palme or Burche trée, from which thei tooke the innermoſt rinde, that I meane, betwixte the cruſte and the trée, of whiche ſubtilly and finely poliſhed, thei framed, and facioned all their bokes, artificially conioigning, and faſtnyng theim together.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, they yet founde an other waie to write, to wéete, on Liuen cloth, fined and poliſhed, with certaine coloures. Here alſo is, and in this place to bée noted, that they then wrote not, as wee nowe do with pennes, but with Reades, whiche in latine may bee called <hi>Calami,</hi> which alſo ſome vſe, euen yet, in this daie. An other kind of Paper was yet founde againe, whiche was made, as it were of certaine little trées, called (as wee finde) by the name of Papers, which, in déede were none other, then a ſorte, or kinde of bull ruſhes, ordinarely growing, in marſhes adionyng to the riuer of <hi>Nile.</hi> Of which ſorte ſome others are founde in <hi>Siria,</hi> nigh to the floodde <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> as recordeth <hi>Plinie,</hi> hauyng the name, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of papers, little thinne leaues, or ſkinnes haue they, betwixt the rinde and the inner parts, whiche fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken or drawen out, with the poincte of an Néelde, trimde afterwarde with a certaine glue, or paſte made with meale, tempered with boyled water and vineagar, was in the ende made a good, and perfect paper, to write drawe, or doo anything theron: and by how muche the nigher, you drewe the ſkinnes, from the inwarde parte of this Ruſhe, or Reede, by ſo muche was it both better, and more fine, and ſo accordyng to the goodneſſe or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theim, thei alſo had diuers and different names.

By meanes wherof many bookes, in maner loſt and hidded, were at laſte pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, to the inſpekable profite, &amp; commoditie of man, whiche was in déede the chife cauſe of ſo many learned men, as this daie are euerie where to be founde through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Chriſtendome: whiche before both ſeldome, and with greate paine attained, to this abſolute knowledge, and perfection in learnyng. But admit here that it were not the firſt, and principal cauſe, yet am I of that minde, that it aſſuredly is the greateſt cauſe, for that with leſſe paine, wee peruſe nowe ſuche as are perfectly corrected, findyng the others euerie where full of faultes, blottes and errours, committed for the moſt parte, either by the leſſe ſkil, or little care of the writer: but if any one were founde, perhaps emong the others faultles, neither was he to be had, or to bée peruſed of all men, ſo that good let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then floriſhed not, as thei now, and this daie, doe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſally euery where. How be it ſince licence firſt was graunted, by Princes to Printe, all bookes, fabulous, wanton, and fruitles, farre better had it béen, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect doubtles, that the waie to printe had neuer béen, to man yet, or knowne, or vnfolded: For it deſtroieth and withdraweth from vertue the good minde, principally of youth, whiche noſeled in theſe follies, leſſe affecteth, or deſireth the ſtudie of better leſſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

ſpeake, by the ſole meanes of whiche, as hath the ſaid <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus,</hi> certaine blinde menne haue learned orderly to write.

One common vſage or cuſtome, was ordinary in the olde age, to weete, that they had in their ſecret Cabinetes, or Studies, the perfect Image and purtraite, of all ſuche as had in anie ſorte, excelled in learnyng. <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth, that <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> beyng yet then liuyng, merited for hys rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and knowledge in good letters, that hys Image ſhoulde haue place, in the library of <hi>Aſinius Polion.

Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng, we ſhall ſome what ſaie, of the ſecrete loue, and hatered, whiche natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is in many thynges, whiche, whence, or how it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth no manne directly knoweth: and is therefore aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, no leſſe ſtraunge, then marueilous. As firſt of all, the enmitie betwixte the Dogge, and the Catte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte Oile, and Pitche, the Harte, and the Serpente, with many ſuche others, whiche in ſuche ſorte malice, and enuie eche the other, this ſecrete rancor, of no parte proceading from th'elementes: for the difference, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie in thynges mixte, or compounde, is to all men aperte, and euident, as wee ſée. The water firſt diſaccor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, as of nature contrary with the fire, for that the fire is hotte and drie, but the water contrary, theſe elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teseche to other oppoſite, and repugnaunte. The water
<pb facs="tcp:12963:125"/>
and the yearth, accorde well together, but in this reſpect onely, that thei bothe bee colde: in the other, that one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng moiſte, that other drie, eche here leaueth the other, as his auncient enemie. Betwixt the fire, and the yearth there is a conformitie, to wéete, in that thei bothe be drie a contrarietie againe, euen betwene theim bothe dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, the fire hoate, that other colde. So that as theſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of parte, agrée together, ſo alſo diſagrée thei, of, parte as is euidente. All thynges then what ſo euer are, cauſed of theſe elementes, muſt be ſubiecte of neceſſitie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe contrary qualities, whiche bee in theſe elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, whence thei mixte are, and compounded. Wherfore that thyng, in whiche ruleth moſte, ſome elementarie qualitie, boroweth his name of the ſaied qualitie: and ſo wée ſaie it to bée, either hoate, colde, moiſte, or drie, ſome in more high degrée then others, accordyng to the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant force, in any theſe elementes. And this theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, contrary either to other, are the onely, and ſole cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of contrary effectes, ſo that whence this diſcrepante, or different nature in thynges is, is now manifeſte, and nedeth no farther explication. But this other enmitie, that proceadeth not from any the elementes, but rather from ſome hidden proprietie, or ſecrete influence, to find the true cauſe, and occaſion thereof, would aſke more earneſte ſtudie, and longer contremplation. The Dogge and Catte (as is aboue ſaied) eche hateth other, neither knowe we the cauſe why. Other creatures alſo ſée wée, that mutually are affectioned either to other, neither iſſueth this their loue, from any the elementes, whereof thei are compoſed. The Aſſe eateth Fenell gyante, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe <hi>Sagapene,</hi> whiche in Latine maie alſo be called <hi>ferula,</hi> and findeth it bothe good, and toothſome, whiche to all other beaſtes, of Horſe kinde, is a very ſtarcke, and plain poiſon. The Fox ioieth, and liketh of the Serpent whiche neuer the leſſe, enuieth all other beaſtes what ſo euer. Neither is this leſſe to be meruailed emong men,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12963:125"/>
then alſo emong any other creatures, for that man nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowyng why, ne yet for what cauſe, eftſones at the firſte ſighte, when he ſhall méete an other, neuer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng before, or ſeen, or knowen hym, will notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng diſdaine, and hate hym, and immediatly findyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the ſecond, no leſſe ſtraunge to hym, then the firſt, will well conceiue of hym, loue, and like hym, and that whiche more is, ſometyme will bothe honour, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence hym, yea, though he be in déede, for cauſes iuſte his inferiour, little accoumptyng of the others, were thei though in truthe greate Lordes, and Rulers. Againe, we ſometymes ſée, twoo men ſo ſtraungely affectioned, that the one voweth hym ſelf to the will, and aduice of the other, whiche oftſones hath happened, betwixte the ſeruaunte, and maiſter, ſo that by nature it ſéemeth (the order of reaſon inuerted) that the vaſſaule was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; no reaſon to bée giuen, of ſo greate a diſorder. In caſe ſemblable ſuche ſubiection, poudered ſometymes, with malicious enmitie, bothe is, and chaunceth emong bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des alſo, as betwixte the Eagle, and the Swanne, the Crowe, and the Kite, whiche at times hardneth her ſelf, to take a preie from the Crowe, euen out of her folded foote, or pinchyng pawes ſliyng. Like enmitie is alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte the Chough, and the Kite; the Egle alſo, and the Gooſe, in ſuche ſorte, that if you laie but one feather of an Egle, emong many, or in a heape of theſe of a Gooſe, that one waſteth, and conſumeth all the others to nothyng. The Harte is mortall enemie vnto the Snake, for with his vehemente reſpiration, aboute her hole, he draweth the Snake out, by force of his breath onely: and without more incontinently deuoureth hym: for proofe whereof, who ſo pleaſeth to burne, onely ſome ſmall parte, or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his horne, ſhall finde that no Serpent, will abide the ſmell thereof. The Crowe, the Aſſe, and Bulle, in like ſorte diſagrée, whoſe iyes the Crowe ſtill beaketh, and laboureth to plucke out. The birde called <hi>Flore,</hi> ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb facs="tcp:12963:126"/>
counterfaiteth the braiyng of a Horſe, by meanes whereof, he as commonly feareth the horſe, as the horſe by the ſame meanes feareth alſo hym. Greate enemies to the Woulfe, is the Foxe, the Aſſe, and the Bulle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Vultur alſo, and the Ele, nature hath proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med continuall warre, and hoſtilitie. The mightie Lion dreadeth, and feareth the Cocke, he alſo flieth the ſighte of fire, and the noice of a carte, the Panther in like ſorte, the preſence of the Hinde: the Scorpion purſueth with fatall enmitie, the Tarentula, whiche in Latin we maie call <hi>Falanga,</hi> whoſe venime, when he hath bitten any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is no waie (as ſome write) cured, but by pleaſant harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and Muſicke, and the malice of theſe twoo beaſtes is ſuche, and ſo impacable, that who alſo is ſtonge, or bitten of the Scorpion, findeth preſente remedie in that oile, where the <hi>Tarentula,</hi> or <hi>Falanga</hi> hath tofore béen drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The monſterous, and houge Elephante, bothe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and flieth the ſimple Serpent, he trembleth at the preſence, and ſight, of a ſhepe, he by no meanes indureth the grunnyng of a Hogge. The Horſe, Aſſe, or Moile, with greate paine abideth to ſée the We ſell, the Snite, or woode Cocke, hardly dwelleth in the ſight of the houſe Cocke. There is a kinde of Faucons, whiche <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth <hi>Tico,</hi> that liueth in continuall warre, and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with the Fox, neuer miſſing to fight with him, where he ſo at any tyme findeth hym. <hi>Elian</hi> mindeth vs or inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſante malice, betwixte an other ſorte of Faucons, called <hi>Pelagra,</hi> and the Crowe, betwixte the Crowe againe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and the harmeles Turtle. Betwixt the Oule and the Curlue, &amp; in fine, betwixt the partridge and the <hi>Tortuis</hi> The Pelican aboue all other birdes, hateth the Quaile, and the Horſe, without compariſon, with moſte pain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth the ſhamois. Like enmitie is alſo naturallye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong fiſhes, the Crabbe maie not abide in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie with the Oiſter, the Dolphin, and the Whale ſlie eche the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Cunger naturally hateth the Lampraie, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:12963:126"/>
Oiſter. The Oiſter on the Ele, hath ſuche a predomina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and malicious force, and the Ele in ſuche ſorte abhorreth and feareth hym, that if by happe ſhe ones ſée hym, ſhe incontinently dieth thereof. The Pike fatally proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, the fiſhe of ſome, called <hi>Mongilla,</hi> or <hi>Mugra:</hi> the Snake beholding a man appareiled, wiſheth him harme and hardeneth her ſelf, as ſhe maie, to bite, and annoye hym, but ſeyng the ſame naked, feareth againe, and flieth hym. The Ratte, or Mouſe rather, is to the Snake an auncient enemie, as well when ſhe is buſied in couching her Egges, as alſo in the Winter, when ſhe lieth deepe hidden, in the intrailes of the yearth: by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Snake to liue in more ſecuritie, heapeth togither in her hole, good ſtore of prouiſion, meates fitte, and wel pleaſyng her aduerſarie the Mouſe, to the intente that the Mouſe beyng well fedde therewith, ſhe at that time might forget, her farther rage, and malice. The Woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes malice towardes the Shepe is ſuche, and ſo naturall, that if you make a drumme of the ſkinne of a Woulfe, the Shepe with no leſſe feare, flieth the ſounde thereof, then if the Woulfe were liuyng, and preſent then before hym. Farther alſo ſome others affirme, that if you make any ſtringes for the Viall, or Lute, of the guttes as well of the Shepe, as of the Woulfe alſo, you neuer ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde them, or frame thence any harmonie. If ye hange the ſkinne of a Woulfe, either in your ſtable, or Shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, or where your flocke is fodthered, the ſighte, and feare thereof, forceth theim to forget their feedyng. The Mouſe by a ſecret proprietie, ſo muche enuieth the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, that whom ſo euer he impoiſoneth, is by clappyng of a Mouſe, on the parte affected, cured. The Viper and Snake, dread meruailouſly the Crabbe, whiche natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath ouer theſe wormes, ſuche aſſured maiſterie, that if a hogge by happe, ſhould be bitten of the Viper, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately expelleth the poiſon, hauyng eaten of the Crabbe. Beſides, whiche moſte ſtraunge is, as ſone as
<pb facs="tcp:12963:127"/>
the Sunne entreth into the ſigne of <hi>Cancer,</hi> all Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes then languiſhe, as ſicke of ſome maladie. The fiſhe called <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> wage continuall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, eche killyng ſtill the other. The Panther in ſuche ſorte feareth the Ounce: that as ſome write, he ſuffereth hymſelf to be ſlaine of hym, without any kinde of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: and alſo if you hang the Panthers ſkinne, in that place where you kéepe the Ounce; the Panthers ſkinne will then pill, waſte, and conſume. Suche is the enmitie alſo of the Chough, and the Dawe, that as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, eche robbeth, and deſtroieth the others Egges. The Waſpe liueth in continuall warre with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: as doeth the Ducke alſo; with the Mouſe or Ratte, eche ſéekyng to deuoure, and eate the others yonge ones. The Kite continually malliceth, and hateth the Foxe. There is a ſmall kinde of Haukes, whiche <hi>Plinie</hi> calleth <hi>Eſalon,</hi> whiche with fatall enmitie, purſueth ſtill the Crowe, he ſearcheth out her neſte, and deſtroieth her eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The hogge hardly indureth the preſence of the we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. The Woulfe, and Lion are enemies ſo contrary, that the blood of the one, will not bee mixte with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Mole or Wante, ſo diſliketh of the Ante, that he abideth not in the place, where the others bee. The Spider wageth priuie warre, againſt the Serpent, and as <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth, doeth hym ſhamefully to dye. Beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des all theſe, emong thynges alſo voide, and lackyng life, like repugnancie, or contrarietie of nature is to be found for as wee firſte ſaied, oile is enemie to Pitche, for triall whereof, who ſo putteth oile into a pitchie veſſell, ſhall ſée that the Pitche will ſone conſume the Oile. Oile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine diſagréeth with water: as dooeth alſo in like ſorte Lime, but Oile and Lime liue in perpetual league, and amitie. The Olife hath a ſecrete, &amp; hidden force, againſt the vnchaſt lecherer, ſuche in déede, and ſo ſtraunge, that as it is written, if a woman leſſe chaſte, attempt to pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hym, ſhe ſhall languiſhe, and die of it, the trée alſo withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.

The ſemblable againe alſo chaunceth to thoſe, in whoſe natiuities, the one hath that Planette for his lorde, whiche to the other is moſte vnfortunate, voide of euery kinde of dignitie. If twoo alſo haue one, and the ſame ſigne, for their aſcende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or otherwiſe for their lorde, and ruler one Planet, he to whom this Planet ſhall bée of moſte force, and aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (as was aboue ſaid in beaſtes voide of reaſon) ſhal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally rule, and haue dominion ouer the other. When then this aduauntage, happeneth to ſuche a one, as is of the other, bothe loued and fauoured, he by meane there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, immediatly bothe ordereth, and gouerneth hym: but if it chaunce, or betide, percaſe to a poore ſeruaunt, or vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaule, he then aſſuredly is faithfull, obedient, and loiall, if to twoo friendes of equall birthe and habilitie (as is, and hath many tymes béen ſeen) eche then liueth with other, in moſte perfecte integritie, the one for the moſte parte orderyng, euery the affaires, or buſines of the other.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Plinie lib. 7. cap. 8.</note> well noteth, of <hi>Meſſala Coruinus,</hi> who after a diſeaſe (of whiche he well recouered) liued euer afterward in ſuche caſe, that he neuer could remember, his owne proper name. <hi>Valerius</hi> alſo diſcourſyng of miracles, reporteth that a learned man, by the knocke of a ſtone, whiche he receiued on the head, forgatte what ſoeuer he before had profited, in any the Sciences, or other good ſtudies, and yet not withſtandyng in al other affaires, was of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as freſhe, and as perfecte as at any other tyme. An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a faule, from a place on high, forgat alſo to know his owne naturall parentes. I haue bothe red, and heard it reported, that <hi>Franciſcus Barbarus,</hi> a man of our tyme, not meanely learned, but eſpecially in the Greke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he moſte pleaſured, by the meane of a maladie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was troubled, forgate all what ſoeuer he before had gained, in the ripe, and exacte knowledge of the ſaied tongue: remainyng in all other thinges, no leſſe learned then at the firſte, a thyng in trouthe very ſtraunge, and merueilous. It is alſo recorded, that <hi>Georgius Trapeſ.</hi> a man famous for his learnyng, forgatte in his age, what ſo in good letters, he tofore had profited. And as we finde here, that memorie in manne, by ſundrie occaſions, maie well be weakened, ſo alſo finde we ſome, that naturally haue had fainte, and ſlippyng memories. The Emperor <hi>Claudius</hi> here in ſo holted, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> writyng his life, reporteth, that ſome tymes hauyng in bedde by hym his wife, incontinently after he had talkte any thyng with her, he ſo became vnmindefull of hym ſelf, and all other thynges, that he would aſke where ſhe was, why ſhe came not to bedde, and why ſhe ſo longe taried.

And as it is ſaid aboue, that ſodaine feare eftfones troubleth the memorie, ſo aſſuredly true is it, that although in deede it vtterly deſtroie not the memorie, yet at times it forceth manne, to forgette theſe thinges, that he before careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with paiue, had committed vnto her, as it ones happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> a moſte excellent Oratour, whiche paſſyng imbaſſadour, to <hi>Philippe</hi> king of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> felt in hym ſelf ſo ſtraunge an alteration, beyng preſente to vtter his charge, before ſo puiſſante a prince, that hauing paſt in ſome little parte, of his premeditated oration, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted of the ſodaine, forgettyng that whiche remained, as if he neuer had before thought thereon or in any ſorte digeſted it.

It is alſo written, that <hi>Cineas,</hi> the ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the renoumed <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> practiſed this arte to help, and aide his memorie. <hi>Plinie,</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> write, that <hi>Simonides</hi> firſte founde this meane, to preſerue the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, although the ſaied <hi>Plinie</hi> affirme, that <hi>Metrodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> reduced it afterwarde to perfection, who alſo by that arte meruailouſly fortified, and confirmed his owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his boke <hi>de oratore, Quintilian</hi> alſo, and <hi>Valerius</hi> in his miracles, reporteth, that <hi>Simonides</hi> on a tyme inuited, with ſundrie others, to a greate bankette, the houſe where thei feaſted, ſodainly fel doune, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wherof no one eſcaped that death, <hi>Simonides</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who euen in that inſtante roſe, and went forthe, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſome one, he neuer yet knewe who, by whiche happe at that tyme, he there ſaued his life.

One other thyng alſo, riſeth here to be noted, whiche is that the Philoſophers, and principally <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> finde a ſcruple, or difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte the memorie, and recordation, for that memorie ſaie thei maie be, as well in beaſtes, as in man, although not in ſo perfecte, and in ſo abſolute a ſorte, and maner, but recordation to man onely, and to hym alone is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whiche is to recorde with diſcourſe, ſtudiyng on thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as in caſes of contemplation, deſcendyng from the generall, to the partes, and perticulers, not omittyng, the circumſtances bothe of tyme, and perſones, and that all with due conſideration, and aduiſe: for beaſtes voide of reaſon, remember alſo the place, where thei at any tyme haue hardly been intreated, the Horſe ſhunneth to dwell, where he hath been harmed, and in like ſorte all others, more or leſſe in their degrées. But as wee haue ſaied, recordation then in man, is muche more abſolute, and perfect, aſſiſted with ſounde aduiſe, and intelligence, orderly paſſyng from matter to matter. So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that manne, that hath a moſte ſharpe, and fined witte, is alſo of better recordatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then an other, though ſome other perhaps exceade hym, in the perfection of memorie: for that to recorde well, is a certain maner of inueſtigation, whiche forceth the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie as it were ſlepyng to awake, to call to minde, and to remember, any thyng, what ſoeuer, wherefore the moſte quicke, and beſte fined wittes, ſoneſte conceiue thynges, and committe them to memorie, and memorie by recordation, maketh of them again, at all times faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſtitution.

This Arnoulde now was riche, eloquent, and learned, and beyng entered into Rome, ſuborned by the deuill, determined on a ſodaine, to depriue his lorde, and maiſter, inrichyng hym ſelf with that honour, if it were poſſible: whiche thyng the better to accompliſhe, with greate ſummes of money, he corrupted twoo impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and twoo accurſed Cardinalles, before whom (to the hearyng of this cauſe deputed) in place to haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truthe, as bothe faithe, and loialtie willed, he vttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte hym, what ſo he faſly could imagine, ſaiyng, that he more ſtode bounde to god, &amp; to the truthe, then in any wiſe he was, or could be vnto man, and therefore muſte nedes confeſſe, that the biſhop in deede was ſuche, as he to be was accuſed: by meanes whereof, the Pope, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed

But to conclude, God neuer long permitteth ſuche tretcherie, and iniuſtice any where vnpuniſhed, to the intente eſpecially, that the innocencie of the iuſte, might the better alwaies be knowen.

                  </gap>e aſſuredly vnto the truthe, is that, when bothe the worlde, and the heauens, were firſt made, the Sunne was then founde in the firſt pointe of <hi>Aries,</hi> whiche mighte bee in the Monethe of Marche, the Somer then beginnyng to come, and growe on. Whiche aſſertion (beſides other likelihoodes, that we alſo ſhall remember) is alſo confirmed by the moſte parte of auncient writers, as well Chriſtians, as alſo Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, emong whiche, we finde Sainct Hierome, Ambroſe, and Baſill, with others, whiche all togither accorde, that the firſte beginnyng was, as is aboue ſaied, <hi>in aequinoctio ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> And although it might appeare, that there was yet ſome little difference betwixte them, for that ſome will, that this woorke was wrought in Marche, but ſome a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, in the Monethe of Aprill. Yet here on thei well agree, that it was in the Spring, as alſo in the <hi>Equinoxe</hi> whiche preſently is in Marche, for, as is ſaied, the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxe</hi> is not euer firme. For Chriſt hymſelf died the .xxv. daie of Marche, and at that time, was the daie, euen with the night, and now this equation, is but about the eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th of Marche, whence it well maie be preſumed, that in the beginnyng, it was in Aprill. For whiche cauſe ſome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted Aprill for the firſt monethe, other ſome March, &amp; yet thei all wil ſaie, that then this frame was wrought when that the Sunne firſte entered into the ſigne of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and that then is this <hi>Equinoxe,</hi> whiche well is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the ſcriptures, where it is ſaied, that in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethe <hi>Niſan,</hi> whiche with vs is Marche, the yere began to haue his firſt daie of accompte. <hi>Vincent</hi> alſo in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng <note place="margin">Exodus. 12.</note> of his mirrour hiſtoriall ſaieth, that the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Hebrues, beganne their yere in the Monethe of Marche, for that then was the <hi>Equinoxe,</hi> ſaieth he, whence, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12963:151"/>
from whiche tyme, the worlde tooke his beginning. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gentiles alſo, defende, and maintain, with like care this opinion, as <hi>Elpaco</hi> in his treatiſe, written of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, where he ſaieth that the Chaldeans, excellente A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomers, ſuppoſed that the firſte daie, in whiche the worlde was created, the Sunne entered into the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Aries,</hi> whiche opinion is maintained of moſt part of Aſtronomers, as well aunciente, as newe, and late writers. When then the Sunne was founde in that poincte, then alſo was the beginnyng of the yere: then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the firſte daie, for before that was none other, neither can it bee denied, but that the firſte daie that was made, was alſo the firſte daie in the accoumpt of yeres, for that before it was neither tyme, or yeres. For whiche cauſe onely, this ſigne of <hi>Aries,</hi> is of all the others reckened the firſt, and foremoſte. And who ſo will iudge, and diuine of thynges to come, he erecteth his figures, calculatyng con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, from that fore ſaied poincte, or beginnyng of the worlde. And farther it is plain, by an euident coniecture, that God when he firſt created the wide, &amp; waſt worlde, that he then alſo plaſte the Sunne (as is ſaied) in <hi>Aries,</hi> as maie well be gathered of that, whiche is fore ſaied, in the chapiter, of the daie and tyme, in whiche our ſauiour ſuffered, to wete, that this Planete was in that place, in the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he alſo was in at the regeneration, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt hymſelf ſuffered his death, and his paſſion, which happened, as is there ſaied, in this <hi>Equinoxe,</hi> ſo often to fore remembred. It alſo ſemeth credible, that it therfore was ſo, for that thoſe that haue any felyng in the ſphere, or otherwiſe in Aſtronomie, ſhall well perceiue, that the Sunne beyng entered into this ſigne of <hi>Aries,</hi> makyng <note place="margin">Or in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary poincte the firſte of Libra.</note> there his reuolution, by the ſpace of one whole daie, no corner is on the yearth, whiche he in that daie ones, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, or to comforte, or ſolace, with his preſence, whiche at no tyme chaunſeth in any other poinctes of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diake, for that where ſoeuer he els bee, ſome place is on

the yeareh, where the Sunne is not in that daie ſéen: but beyng in this degree (as is ſaied) or in his oppoſite, no parte of the worlde is there, whiche in that daie, ones ſeeth hym not. And it ſemeth reaſonable, that the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne when he firſte of all beganne his circuite, that he there, and in ſuche place ſhould beginne, where he might viſite euery the partes of the whole worlde, and that, that, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould bee, in the firſte of <hi>Aries,</hi> then of <hi>Libra,</hi> it of parte is euidente by that, whiche wee haue ſaied, that in the daie of the death, or Paſſion of our ſauiour, this Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net was in that verie ſame place, in whiche he alſo hath a certain perticuler dignitie. Reſtyng then on this poinct as on a truthe aſſured, thei doubtles are deceiued, that imagined the worlde firſte beganne, in the <hi>Equinoxe</hi> of September, though it pleaſed theim to ſaie, that then all fruites were ripe, and in ſeaſon, whiche if we well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is nothyng ſo in deede: for when thei are ripe in the Northe parte of the worlde, thei nothyng at all, then are ſo in the Southe, but in verie truthe, and aſſuredlie the contrary. For whiche cauſe, I neither would leane to the opinion of thoſe, whiche ſaied, that in this <hi>Equinoxe</hi> of Marche (whiche is in the ſame beginnyng, whiche we in deede approue) was, or ought to bee, the entrie therefore of the worlde, for that then, &amp; at that tyme is the ſpring, for that flowers alſo, and graſſe eche where then begin to come that then alſo all beaſtes, acquainte them with their matche, for if it be to vs, as it can not be gainſaied, the commyng and beginnyng of all graine, and graſſe, it then is Winter, or at the leaſte <hi>Autumne,</hi> to theſe that inhabite the Southe partes of the worlde. Theſe then maie ſuffice, with the aucthorities aboue remembred, to ſatiſfie and contente, the reaſonable in this matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the yere Romaine, whiche onely now is vſed, take his beginnyng of the firſte daie of Ianuarie: whiche thyng happened by the fonde deuotion, and ſuperſtition onely, whiche the Gentiles vſed towardes their God <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:12963:152"/>
doing their yere to beginne by his name, as the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did theirs, from the natiuitie of Chriſte, although then in deede, the yere had not his beginnyng. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines alſo beganne their yere in Marche, as writeth <hi>M. Varro,</hi> and <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his firſte booke, <hi>Ouide</hi> alſo in <hi>Faſtis,</hi> with many others. Farther GOD ſhewed to vs his greate fauour, and goodnes, in that it pleaſed hym, to place our firſte parentes, Eue and Adam, in theſe <hi>Septen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trionall</hi> partes of the worlde, after their exile, and detru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of Paradiſe terreſtriall, whiche bothe entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this worlde, at the firſte commyng of the Spryng, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the yearth then greene, and flowred, the aire verie ſwete; temperate; and pleaſaunte, the better to ſolas, and comforte them in their miſerie; and nakedneſſe, whiche at none other tyme of the yere, could ſo well haue chaunſed them. But paſſe we this matter now, as ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and ſpeake we of the other Planetes, eſpecially of the Moone, as one emong the others of moſte force, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, whiche as ſome ſuppoſe in the firſte daie, or inſtaunte of her creation, was placed by diuine prouidence, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction with the Sunne: others ſaie that ſhe was then at full, and in direct oppoſition Sainct Auguſtine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menting on the fifte of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> remembreth bothe, theſe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered opinions, ſaiyng: that thei that maintaine, that ſhe then was in oppoſition, argue that it was not reaſon, in that her firſte creation, that ſhe either ſhould lacke, or bée defectuous in any thyng. The others ſaie that it is more credible, that ſhe in coniunction beganne there her firſte daie, ſo increaſyng, accordyng to our accompte in her age: but to abridge this controuerſie, in myne opinion, ſhe at her firſt beyng was in plaine, and perfecte oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the Sunne, whiche opinion is moſte receiued of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Auguſtine in the place aboue alledged, and <hi>Rabanus</hi> alſo on the twelueth of <hi>Exodus,</hi> arreſt them bothe on this opinion, accordyng with that whiche is redde in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where as it is ſaied, that God made twoo excellent
<pb facs="tcp:12963:153"/>
lightes, the one to lende comforte, and brightnes to the daie, the other and the leſſe, to ſhine in the night. But in that inſtant it ſelf, when the Sunne firſt appered, he gaue light on the ſodaine, to the one halfe of the worlde, ſo that in that halfe, it preſently was daie, the other beyng darck, and couered with the ſhadowe of the yearth. How bee it, it ſemeth reaſonable, that on that other moitie of the earth, cladde as is ſaied with the night, and darknes, the Moone there ſhould doe her charge, and office, in illightnyng it, ſo as thei bothe were created at one, and the ſame inſtant, ſo thei bothe alſo might execute their office at one inſtante, the one giuyng light, and ſolace to the daie, the other not obſcuryng, or darkenyng the night, euenſo, and in ſuche ſorte, as hath in deede the texte, for then was verified that parte of ſcripture, the whole worlde through lightened, bothe on the one ſide, and the other. And contrarywiſe, if the Moone then had been founde in coniuction, then this common light could not haue chaunſed, vntil fiftene daies after, and farther three, or fower daies muſte alſo firſte haue paſte, before her light could haue béen ſeen, or percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any where, and the ſame ſhould haue been a verie ſmall light alſo, as that whiche we ſee, when ſhe fower, or fiue daies is of age.

Mercellus,</hi> that moſt victoriouſlie conquired, and ſubdued <hi>Siracuſa,</hi> as alſo to <hi>Scipio</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerranne all Spain. Againe to the obtainyng of this fore ſaide honor, it was alſo requiſite, that the battaile fought with the ennimy ſhould be greate, and daungerous, and that there ſhould be ſlaine therin, a boue fiue thouſande. Of theſe thinges writeth <hi>Valerius Maximus.</hi> It is alſo written, that <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>L. Marius</hi> tribunes, ordained a lawe, to dooe ſharpe, and ſeueare, animaduertion on all Capitaines that ſhould make falſe report of the number ſlaine. Neither was it ſufficient to winde the battaile, were it neuer ſo blooddy and dangerous: but he alſo muſt make tributory, and ſubiect the whole prouince, leauyng it quiet, and in peace to his ſucceſſor, bringing alſo home with hym his army victorious. For which cauſe as <hi>Liuie</hi> recordeth, the triumphe was denied to <hi>Titus Manlius,</hi> though in truthe he hadde obtained greate victories in Spaine, for that after him thei were forced to ouerrunne the countrie againe, to wage newe battaile, to kepe by force, and defende that whiche before was gotten. For this cauſe alſo <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> the greate, triumphed not, though in deede he once had ſubdued all <hi>Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pagna,</hi> as alſo recordeth <hi>Valerius Maximus.</hi> It alſo was the maner that he that triumphed, ſhould inuite to hym that might, the <hi>Conſuls</hi> to ſupper, which they vtterly (ſuche was the maner) refuſed, for that, at that feaſte, was at no time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to whom greater honour was doen then to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpher. Theſe triumphes were euer ended in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> with in the Capitoll, where he offered vp the whole ſpoile whiche he had taken from the ennimie, where alſo (for greater ſolemnization) publicke aſſemble
<pb facs="tcp:12963:159"/>
was then made. And to the intente that this Capitaine ſhoulde not glory to muche of this honour doen to hym, it is reported that a bonde man ſhould that day be placed by hym, to whom it was permitted to ſkoffe, and deride hym, in ſuche ſorte, and manner, as it beſte ſhould like hym, where of ſundry examples are found in olde hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But to make more plaine this kinde of triumphe if it be poſſible, we wil remember ſome, but firſt of al that, of <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> a capitaine Romaine, moſte famous, and valiaunte, to whom, for that he had ſubdued, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Perſius</hi> king of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> vtterly ſpoilyng, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng his countrie, the triumphe was graunted, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſuffrage of all men, who as <hi>Plutarche</hi> reciteth, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed in this maner. Firſt of all, the inhabitantes of Rome, as well as of other places nigh adiacente, were that daie ſeen in their moſt ſumptuous, and riche attire, euery of them indeuouring to place himſelf, in ſome too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng hole, or windowe, the better, and with more eaſe, to beholde this ſpectacle. All the temples in Rome, were on euery ſide open, hangde, and apparelied, with moſte coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniture, with grene boughes, &amp; perfumes, of no ſmal value, the ſtreates alſo were like gaie, and glorious. And for that the multitude of people in the citie, was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, as well of ſtraungers, as alſo of others, a number of ſticklers was appoincted, to make through the ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, eaſie waie, and paſſage, and for that the diuerſitie of ſhewes, were ſuche, and ſo many, neceſſitie conſtrained them, to parte them into three daies: the firſt hardly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, in good order to bryng in the banners, ſtandardes, and enſignes of the conquered, the <hi>Coloſsi,</hi> Images, and tables of price, whiche all were brought in on cartes, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie curiouſly depainted, and trimmed. On the ſecond daie came in the armour of the kyng conquered, as alſo of all th'other <hi>Macedomens,</hi> whiche as thei were riche, bright, and glitteryng, ſo were thei with moſte cunnyng to the ſhe we ordered, and couched on cartes. After theſe cartes
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12963:159"/>
entered three thouſande men in order, bearyng nothyng but money open, and to bee ſeen, and that in houge char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and veſſelles of ſiluer, waighyng euery one three talentes at the leaſte, of whiche were three hundred and fiftie in noumber, fower menne lotted to euery veſſell. The others, the reſidue I meane of this three thouſand) brought in cundites ſtreming, moſt artificially wrought with other plate all ſiluer, no leſſe faire, then maſſie, and in paſſyng of theſe companies, in iuſte and ſemely order, thei ended the ſecond daie in moſt pompous ſolemnitie. The thirde daie, euen in the breake, or ſpryng thereof, with the firſte band entered (a ioyous ſigne of conqueſt) infinite flutes, drommes, trumpettes, with others ſuche like Martiall, and warlike inſtrumentes, ſoundyng all togither, not delicately, or ſwetely, but in moſte terrible and cruell maner that was poſſible, in ſuche ſort, as thei preſently ſhould ioigne in battaile: and after them came an hundreth and twentie Kine, all white, hauyng their hornes curiouſly gilted, their bodies couered with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain riche vailes, whiche thei accompted as ſacred or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, bearyng alſo garlandes of flowers on their heddes, driuen by certaine yonge boies, no leſſe well fauoured, then curiouſly attired, to the place where thei ſhould bee to their goddes Sacrificed, after whom alſo, came other children againe, charged with greate platers of gold, and ſiluer for the Sacrifice. After theſe came others againe, ſeuentie and ſeuen, whiche in veſſelles of golde, carried all the gold that thei had gathered in coigne: after whom came then thei, that carried the greate gobblet, poiſyng fully tenne talentes of gold, whiche <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> had dooen to be made, ſette alſo, and inrichte with ſtones of rare price: and thei that bare theſe veſſels of golde, were ſuche as were nigheſt, and beſte beloued of theſe kinges, to wete, of <hi>Antigonus. Seleucus,</hi> and other kynges of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> and eſpecially of <hi>Perſius</hi> the honourableſte of them. After this followed the couche of the kynge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
<pb facs="tcp:12963:160"/>
with his owne proper armour laied a parte to be ſeen, his diademe, or croune, with his ſcepter roiall, laied in ſemely order, to the vewe, vpon his armour. After his coache came priſoners on foote, the little infauntes, his owne naturall children, and followyng theim, a greate troope of his ſeruauntes, and officers, as maiſters of the houſhold ſecretaries, vſhers, comptrollers, chamberlai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, with others ſuche of his courte, or familie, all wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng and wailyng, in maner ſo dolorous, ſeyng them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues brought nowe into ſuche ſeruitude, and extremitie, that thei moued to compaſſion, all ſuche as beheld them. Of the kynges children there were twoo boies, and one maide, of age yet then ſo yonge, and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, that thei were leſſe capable of their infortune, and miſerie, by meanes whereof the people were more moued to pitie, ſorrowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng in ſtraunge maner, to ſee them in that miſerie. In this triumphe, then followed the father, his owne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the vſage of his countrie, cladde all in blacke, who marchte by his countenaunce all amaſed, and fearfull, as in deede he had good cauſe, his preſente eſtate conſidered. Then followed the kyng, ſundrie of his approued frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, which beholding in that plight, their vnhappie prince brake out into teares, and ſighes, ſo bitterly, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines themſelues, be wepte that their infortunacie. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe folowed one, carriyng certain diademes, whiche ſome auncient cities in Grece, had preſented vnto <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who immediatly followed in perſone triumphantly, mounted in a chariotte, appareiled with purple Tiſſue, hauyng a bough of Laurell in his hande, with a croune al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of theſame on his hedde, whom followed his owne ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, bothe foote menne, and horſe menne, all armed in moſte decente order, holdyng alſo eche of them a Laurell bough in his hande, their enſiegnes, and banners ſoldiour like diſplaied, ſyngyng delicate ſonges, in the honour of their capitaine triumphyng, with many other like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters moſte roiall, and magnificent. This then was the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12963:160"/>
order of <hi>Aemilius</hi> his triumphe in Rome. Th'others for the moſt parte followed alſo this order, addyng or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhyng ſome fewe thinges as beſt liked theim, and laſte of all offered vppe the ſpoile or bootie, in the temple of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> with in the Capitoll, where in ſuche forme and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as their vaine religion required, they gaue thankes to their Gods, for their victorie obtained. And although in this ſorte thei commonly obſerued their triumphes, yet were there certaine lawes, that of parte limited the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of theſe triumphes, and that accordyng to the deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of the triumphant, makyng diſtinction, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence both of the ſtréetes and gates whereat thei ſhould enter, the tymes alſo, by the <hi>Senate</hi> were appointed theim, but as touchyng all other thnyges, as ſhewes, plaies, bankettes, and ſuche others, it was lawfull for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man accordong to his apetite, to inriche, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phe, as beſt pleaſed him: and as for his Coache he alſo vſed that, as was to hym beſt ſemyng, for it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that ſome drewe them with fower white horſes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſome with bulles. The greate <hi>Pompe</hi> when he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed for his victories in <hi>Africa,</hi> he entered Rome, hys Chariote trained with Elephantes. <hi>Suetonius</hi> recordeth that when <hi>Caeſar</hi> triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phed, he entred Rome, drawne with fortie Elephantes: in mauer ſemblable came in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Gordian</hi> alſo. And as <hi>Flauius</hi> writeth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Aurelius</hi> whiche in like maner was alſo king of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> had his Coache triumphant drawen with wilde Hartes: <hi>M. Antonius</hi> alſo with Lions. The Romaine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaines farther vſually accuſtomed, to haue euermore in their triumphant Coache with theim, one childe verie yong; or ſome tymes more: whiche <hi>Cicero</hi> well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereth in his oration pro <hi>Murena.</hi> Some alſo broughte with theim, from the place where thei conquired infinite numbers of ſtraunge and ſauage beaſtes, as Lions, Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Beares, Tigers, Rinocerons, Panthers, Droma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, Elephantes, with many ſuch others, as did <hi>Titus</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12963:161"/>
and <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> as recordeth <hi>Ioſephus.</hi> Other ſome alſo entered, with moſt diuerſitie of muſicke that was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vſing as well their inſtrumentes, as their voices, with inſpekable others, ſuche harmonious delectotions: among all which triumphes, ſome were more exquiſite, and more abſolute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the others, as thoſe of <hi>Pompe,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> theſe alſo of the two <hi>Scipioes,</hi> brothers, and in fine theſe of the Emperours, whereof <hi>Blondus</hi> remembereth in his booke, <hi>de Roma triumphante:</hi> and as writeth <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Oroſius,</hi> there triumphed in Rome at ſundrie tymes, thrée hundred, and twenty famous Capitaines, the laſte of whiche all was the Emperour <hi>Probus,</hi> in whoſe time the Empire firſte beganne to decline. There was alſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Rome an other kinde of welcome, or ſolemne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauyng, whiche was ſome thing leſſe coſtly, and leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable then the triumphe, whiche they termed, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an ouation, which as <hi>A. Gellius</hi> recordeth, was grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto Capitaines for their victories, then I ſaie, when ſome one thinge or other failed in theim, ſo that they might not by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitutions demande the triumphe: as for example, if the Capitaine were nether <hi>Conſul,</hi> or <hi>Proconſul,</hi> or had conquired at his pleaſure without any daungerous reſiſtance, or for that the battaile was leſſe cruell and blooddy, or for that he had ſubdued a people bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and of ſmall reputation, or that the warre was enterpriſed, without expreſſe commaundement from the <hi>Senate,</hi> or for other ſuche like, and ſemblable cauſes. So that in place then of the triumphe, this Ouation was graunted theim, whiche was in ſuche ſorte as followeth. The Capitaine entered Rome on horſe backe, in ſteade of a Coach, and ſome alſo at the firſte came in on foote, <note place="margin">A. Gellius lib. 6 cap. 6. noct. At.</note> crouned with hearbes, whiche were offered vnto <hi>Venus</hi> for that theſe victories were rather eſtemed venerius, then <hi>Martial.</hi> Neither entered the ſouldiars of theſe capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines armed, ne yet ſounded they any Trompette, or Dromme which might geue or force ſome <hi>Martial</hi> noiſe,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:12963:161"/>
but vſed onely flutes, vials, and others, ſwete, &amp; muſicall inſtrumentes. How be it, thei brought with them in ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe we their praie, or bootie, the <hi>Senate</hi> meting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the citie in the fieldes, feaſtyng, praiſing, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng them merueilouſly, whiche honour (though in déede farre inferiour to th'other) ſundry honorable perſonages hath both yet ſought, &amp; accepted it. The firſte that in this ſorte was receaued in to Rome, was <hi>Poſthumius Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> for his victorie obtained againſt the <hi>Sabines,</hi> and next <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> for his victorie in <hi>Siracuſa. Suetonius</hi> writeth, that <hi>Octauianꝰ Caeſar,</hi> entered Rome alſo with this petie triumph <hi>poſt bella Philippica,</hi> and his other war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in <hi>Sicilie. Plinie</hi> writeth that there were ſundry Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaines, to whom the triumphe beyng denied, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theimſelues notwithſtandyng with this kinde of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. The cauſe why this little triumphe was termed by this name, was for that the ſacrifice whiche the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaine did, or offered that daie, was of a ſheepe, whiche may in latin be called <hi>Ouis,</hi> but thei that triumphed offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Bull, ſo that from this worde <hi>Ouis,</hi> came that other of Ouation, their welcome, or ioious receauyng in to Rome againe. Others ſaie that it tooke his beginnyng of that voice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people Oe, or other wiſe <hi>Oue,</hi> but for that <note place="margin">Or it might be ſaied to riſe of the latin word <hi>Ouo,</hi> whiche is to reioice. Whence alſo is deriued <hi>Ouatio</hi> and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence this Ouation.</note> to reſte here on is a matter of leſſe importance, let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that thei called it an Ouation, whether it tooke his denomination, ether of that firſt latin worde <hi>Ouis,</hi> or els of that other Oe, or <hi>Oue.</hi> It farther was permitted to all Capitaines triumphant, that thei ſhould ſette vppe their Images, in all Temples, and common places, that they ſhould erect at their pleaſure any Columnes, or pillours, geuyng theim the name of Pillours triumphant, builte of Marble, workyng in theim, in moſte curious manner poſſible, euery their battailes, and victories, to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall renoume, and honour, a ſhewe of whiche, is yet this daie to be ſeen in Rome. Whiche thinges thei firſte did, followyng, the Trophees of the <hi>Grekes,</hi> whiche alſo
<pb facs="tcp:12963:162"/>
were doen in ſuche ſorte as followeth. In the very ſame place, where any Capitaine, obtained the victory againſt his ennimy, he did to be ſet vp there a greate, and houge tree, cuttyng from the ſame, all his armes, or boughes, faſtnyng to the ſtocke, the armure of the vanquiſhed, to his perpetuall honour, and renoume, and this called thei a Trophe, of that Greke word <hi>Tropi,</hi> whiche may ſignifie conuertion, flight, or retraite, for that in that place, the ennimy was put to flight: and this with theſe Trophes, the Romaines firſt acquainted theimſelues, for as <hi>Saluſt</hi> writeth, <hi>Pompe</hi> on a time hauyng va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, plaſte his trophes, on the toppes, of the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines <hi>Pirenei,</hi> whiche vſage by tracte of tyme, grewe after into ſuche eſtimation, that thei made them of ſtone, wronght artificially. How bee it, this thyng ſemeth to bee of more antiquitie, and that other nations alſo before the <hi>Grekes</hi> vſed it, for it is redde in the fiftenth Chapiter of the firſte booke of the Kynges, that <hi>Saul</hi> hauing vanquiſhed <hi>Agag</hi> King of the <hi>Amalachites,</hi> came after to mounte <hi>Carmell,</hi> where he erected an arche triumphall, in the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and memorie of his victories. To conclude the honour of a triumphe was ſuche, and ſo eſtimed, that no one other was ſo much deſired in Rome, ſo that their Capitaines refuſed no paine, no perill, or daunger, howe greate, or what ſoeuer, ſo that in fine thei might attaine to that ineſtimable honour. Beſides, theſe Capitaines that thus triumphed, became merueilous riche, by the ſpoiles of the conquered, to theim alſo were geuen, great preſentes by their fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: which I onely to this purpoſe, in this place would remember, that princes might hence learne, how to recompenſe, and reward their capitaines, and other ſoldiars what ſo euer, accordyng to their deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: for commonly in theſe daies, the daintie coward, and niſe Carpette man, is more largely conſidered of, then thoſe that imploie, both their gooddes, and their liues, in the ſeruice of the Prince, and defence of their countrie.</p>

               <head>¶ Of three ſundrie doubtes, whiche the auncient Philoſophers were neuer able to reſolue, with the cauſes why. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 4.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE aunciente Philoſophers, by the meruailous inſtincte of God, curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſearchte out the cauſes, of eche the workes of nature, aſſertainyng their propoſitions, without contradiction, or repugnauncie, of any others. Yet neuer were thei able to reſolue theſe three thinges, of parte doubtfull, and of ſome importance with the cauſes aſſured of their ſpryng, and beyng. The firſt is, that thei well knewe, there was giuen vnto man by nature, a deſire neuer to dye, or departe hence, neuer to fele ſmarte, or any annoye what ſoeuer, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to ſugiorne, with felicitie perpetuall, and pleaſure in this worlde, neuer ſauoryng of any lacke, or defaulte of any thyng, but yet could not attaine to that deſired ende or marke. And on the other ſide well aſſured, that GOD and Nature, neuer attempted any thyng in vaine, and farther that this, mannes appetite proceded onely of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, toilyng, &amp; ſuppoſyng herein to finde the cauſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that this <hi>axiome</hi> in any other thing neuer failed, thei folded, and refolded theim ſelues, in infinite perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xities, ceſſyng in diſpaire, to loſe this knotte or ſcruple. The ſeconde was that thei ſaied, that eche manne felte in hym ſelf, a certaine naturall, and peruerſe inclination of the fleſhe, and farther, a ſenſuallitie plaine contrarie to the aboue ſaied deſire, or appetite, whiche was not to dye, or ſauour of corruption, as in this carnall motion, whiche caſteth man into ſundrie daungers, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhortnyng his tyme, and his daies ſo muche deſired. The ſemblable alſo riſeth of exceſſe in ſurfeting, beſides that others ſome againe, deſirous ſodainly to mounte to greate pompe, and honour, haſſarde themſelues to winde
<pb facs="tcp:12963:179"/>
the ſporres in field, where co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly thei fall, or els returne oft times, with a fearce, &amp; troubled minde, or in fine ſome miſhap or infortune there betides the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, an ende al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to that thei ſo muche affected. The third is, that in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, the bodies inferiour, are gouerned by the ſuperiours, as for example the elementes, by the bodies celeſtiall: the Orbes, or Spheares of the Planettes (as Philoſophers will) by the intelligences, and they againe by the firſt maker, or mouer of al thinges, God the onely and the ſole cauſe, and prince eternal. But in man alone this order is now peruerted, who being of two partes, to weete the ſoule, &amp; bodie, we ſee that the fleaſhe in truth both vile, and abiecte, rageth, and rebelleth againſt the minde, and reaſon, and that whiche worſt is draweth it, to his owne frowarde will and pleaſure, whence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaide, that he in his members felte, a lawe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, and repugnant to the lawe of reaſon, mouyng it to ſinne, and to vniuſt rebellion. The philoſophers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that liued before the commyng of our ſauiour knew nothyng at all, the occaſion of this diſorder, but curiouſly ſekyng ſome cauſe thereof, or reaſon, fell into ſundry er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious, and fonde opinions. Whence <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> ſaide, that this monſtroſitie, or diſordered rebellion, began at the firſt, in the beginnyng of the worlde, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all thinges were folded without regarde, or reſpect in that auncient <hi>Chaos:</hi> for ſeparating this force of reaſon by diſcorde and reioynyng it againe afterwarde by concorde, it ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euerie thing good, and perfecte in his kinde, man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone excepted, whoſe body it vniteth ſtoberne, and diſloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, with the ſoule onely abſolute, and reaſonable. And therfore as theſe twoo, in this <hi>Chaos</hi> firſte diſagreed, ſo euer more continue thei in diſcorde, and in enmitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the rule, and order of all other thinges. In this ſorte this poore, and leſſe aduiſed philoſopher, attributed the faulte hereof to the diuine prouidence. Others alſo ſaide, that this onely happened, by diuerſitie of conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12963:179"/>
vnder which man was both borne, and conceaued. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> neuer hardned himſelf, plainly and appertly to vnknot this preſente ſcruple, but rather he gainſaieth it, himſelf affirmyng, that mans will is naturally inclined to euill, ſo that with greate difficultie, it is, or maye bee brought ſubiecte vnto reaſon. And in an other place hee ſaieth, that the felicitie whiche manne by vertue here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, is the abſolute, and perfecte gifte of God alone. To conclude then, vertue, in the action, or operation where of, the felicitie of man fully conſiſteth, muſt be the gifte of God, and not of nature onely. On the other ſide the <hi>Manichies</hi> deſirous to yelde ſome reaſon of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, and iniuſte order ſaide, that in manne were twoo ſoules to geather, the one good, of the true and perfecte ſubſtaunce, of the prince of light, the other impious, and accurſed, takyng his ſpring of the Prince of darckenes, whence this warre, was this in man continued. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaieth, that before the creation or frame of the worlde, all ſoules ſinnyng againſt the diuine maieſtie, were kept and reſerued in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a time, but afterward for their puniſhmente, were plaſte againe in bodies, of harde, and noughtie nature, whence this rebellion, in man, in this ſorte liueth. But all theſe opinions both erronious, and deteſtable, are confuted by Sainct <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Manichies,</hi> in his booke <hi>De duab. anim.</hi> and in an other of his, <hi>De nat. boni.</hi> where with longe reaſons moſt learnedly he ſheweth, the cauſe why they neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the knowleage, or felyng, of this foreſaide diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, which was for that they neuer had hearde, or kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen any thing of the ſcriptures, by whiche we fully are reſolued in euery, and all theſe ſcruples, by whiche alſo it is euident, that both theſe propoſitions are aunſweryng, and conſonant vnto the order of nature. To weete that God, and nature attempte nothyng in vaine, and that it againe is conuenable, that man by nature ſhould feare, and refuce to taſte of death, deſirous to liue in continued
<pb facs="tcp:12963:180"/>
ioie, and pleaſure, though he yet neuer attaine thereto in any ſorte: ne yet therfore is this deſire of his in vaine, but rather accordeth perfectly with nature, but not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the effecte, or ende thereof, is to manne an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and therefore leſſe naturall. For God created man, firſte to liue immortall, in ſuche ſorte that accordyng to the opion of moſte diuines, he neuer ſhould haue died, or taſted of any miſerie, had he, or kepte, or obſerued the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes geuen him, but hauing tranſgreſt theim he ſtreight became ſubiecte, to the ſtormie tempeſtes of this world, and finally to death: and this by diſobedience, man here hath purchaſte anguiſhe, the graue, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So as the Apoſtle ſaieth, by the ſinne of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, death firſt crepte in, and entered into this worlde. Hence nowe it then is euident, that death was neither naturall in our firſt father Adam, ne after him in vs, but caſuall and accidentall, as nothyng at all leſſe mente vs by the diuine prouidence. Now then this doubte, maie alſo this be reſolued, that the deſire neuer to die, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure annoie, is lent vs from nature, and that not in vain, for that it ſome tymes was in vs, if manne then had not ſinned) aſſuredly to haue attained, the effecte ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired: but beyng (as we are) rebellious and obſtinate this deſire ſtill remaineth, but ſo to be, is denied vs. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde doubte alſo, by this meanes may be reſolued, for that through glotteny, and venerie, we haſten our fall, and ruine. In ſemblable ſorte the thirde alſo, by the ſinne of Adam, by meanes where of, he fell from that originall iuſtice, or ſtate of grace, whiche God before to hym, had freely geuen, and graunted, ſeruyng hym to moderate, his life, and each his actions. Whence immediatly began to followe this diſordre, for reaſon that ſhould rule, and order thinges aright, lieth ſubiecte vnto the will, and to euery the ſenſes: ſo that it appeareth plainly, that thys peruerſe order, is in no reſpecte naturall, but (as is ſaide) of fortune, and altogether caſuall. By which meanes we
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:12963:180"/>
here conclude, that thinges of greateſt excellencie, and of aſſured perfection ſhould, and ought to gouerneth others of baſe condition, and this neuer miſſeth, or faileth at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tyme, as is more then plaine, in euerie the bodies, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixte, and celeſtiall, but although in manne experience ſhewe the contrarie, that iſſueth of fortune (who by hys fall hath merited not that, but greater puniſhment) and not at all from nature.</p>

of this religion, of which thei yet had no perfect, nor none other aſſured grounde, ſo by more ſure reaſon, they gladly ſhould haue bene Patrones and Protectors of the true and Chriſtian faith, if it had been to theim, as to vs it is reuealed. By the effecte it then is euident, that long tyme he kepte, and preſerued theim in proſperitie, with fortunate ſucceſſe in their affaires te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall. The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies then which the Romaines vſed in time of peace, are many and diuers, whiche I leaue to ſpeake of, for that if I ſhould all penne theim, I ſhould wery, &amp; greue percaſe the reader, &amp; to ſpeake therof to little, were iniurious in my phantaſie. Wherfore I ſhall in this place remember fiue onely, whiche they orderly obſerued before thei pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed warre againſt any prince, or countrie, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that Princes of our tyme may ſee, how muche they erre, raſhlie to denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, warre and hoſtilitie, not crauing firſte Gods aſſiſtaunce, his aide, and his ſuccour: and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that thei alſo maie knowe, that he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce onely, on them befalleth, commonly ſuche euill, aduerſe, and finiſter fortune, and finally how farre in pointes of religion, thei in truthe be inferiour, to theſe Ethnikes, and Idolaters. Now then when newes came to Rome of any rebellion or that any prince barbarous, had inuaded their territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or that any other had doen iniurie to their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, thei immediatly ſente foorthe their ambaſſadours vnto hym, by whiche the Senate, by faire meanes adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hym, to make reſtitution of the domage, and wronge committed, and farther that he euer afterwarde, refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from ſuche incurſions: whiche aduiſe if he eſtemed not, then did thei warre to bée proclaimed immediately. The Senate then hauyng choſen ſome capitaine for this iourney, did all their Sacrificatours, incontinently to be called, whiche receiued in commaundement, to praie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Goddes, for the happie ſucceſſe, and good fortune of their people. For the Romaines went neuer forthe, to ſpill the blood of their enemies, before their prieſtes had
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:12963:181"/>
bitterly wepte, and praied in their Temples. After this the Senate, beyng aſſembled all togither, wente in good order to the Churche of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> where ſolemnely thei ſwore al, or plighted this faith, that when ſo euer yet, the enemie (againſte whom warre by theim was then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced) would deſire a truſe, or peace againe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or otherwiſe would craue pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his defaute, that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſhould not in any caſe be denied hym. This dooen the newe Conſull, choſen for this expedition, haſtneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againe forthwith vnto the Capitoll, where he voweth to hym of the Gods, in whom he repoſeth, or moſte hope, or confidence, that he will offer, if he retourne victorious, the beſte thyng that he hath, of what price ſo euer. And although the thyng offered, were of neuer ſo greate va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, yet were the people bound to repais it hym againe. After this an Enſigne, hauing in it an Egle (whiche was the true, and auncient armes of the Romaines) was brought out into the filde of <hi>Mars,</hi> whiche thei onely did to this ende or purpoſe, that the people might knowe that it was then leſſe lawfull, to vſe any plaies, or other pleaſant ſpectacles, whilſte that their frendes, and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne, were then in filde, and in armes, and in fine the <hi>Pretor,</hi> beyng mounted on high, on one of their gates, ſounded a Trumpette, to call together their Souldiars, deliueryng with the ſame certeine Enſignes vnto the Capitaine. Hence it appeareth, that thei neuer woulde arme themſelues before thei firſt had appeaſed, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored their Gods, crauing their aſſiſtaunce in that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, or fight, againſt their ennimies. For if the Conſull or Capitaine, aſſigned by the <hi>Senate,</hi> happely ſubdued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prouince, or Citie, not valiauntly, and honourably, but by prodition and by tretchery, he afterwarde ſhould be puniſhed by the ſaide <hi>Senate</hi> greuouſly. Where of we finde ſundry examples, of whiche I ſhall remember but twoo here preſently, the one of their excellent prowes and vertue, the other how thei handled one, that by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable

policie had conquired his ennimy. <hi>Fabritius</hi> on a time, with an armie of the Romaines liyng before <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena,</hi> a certain ſcholemaiſter iſſued with his ſcholers out of the Citie, who ſuppoſing highly to gratifie this Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, haſtely did himſelf to be brought into his preſence, whom incontinently this Conſull (although by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainyng of theim, beyng as thei were, the ſoonnes of the moſt honorable, &amp; richeſt of the towne, he ſtreight ſhould haue been receaued for their Lorde into the citie) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed to accepte, and receaue hym, but did hym to be ſtripte in their preſence naked, and bindyng his handes, gaue to euerie of his ſchollers, roddes to ſkurge hym, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng this traitour backe ſo, vnto their frendes, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, by meanes whereof he wonde the hartes of the Citiſens, which immediatly yelded theimſelues ſubiect to the Romaines. On the other ſide, in the yere of the foundation of Rome three hundred, and eightene, warre was proclaimed by the Conſuls againſt the <hi>Sarmates,</hi> and others the inhabitauntes of the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> whiche as is ſien in tables of Coſmographie, deuideth <hi>Aſia</hi> in the midle, bandyng <hi>Scythia</hi> on the one ſide, and endyng in <hi>India,</hi> where by meanes of extreame colde, no Grape at all groweth.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Iue principall thynges are there, that diſtourne manne from the ripe, and mature cognition of thynges in this life, whiche if he well knewe, he then might repute himſelf for perfecte, and wiſe. The firſte is the ignorauncie, or not knowyng, of his ende, to wette, his not knowyng, to what ende he is borne. For aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he well knewe it, he would no thyng leſſe pain hym ſelf, to attaine there vnto, then he preſently doeth, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to pompe, and honour, in whiche (appetite rulyng hym) his onely felicitie ſemeth to conſiſte. But in this caſe, I maie compare manne, to a kynges ſoonne in his infancie, of whom, if you will aſke, whiche he loueth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſucceſſion of a kyngdome, or els an aple, or a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, whiche preſently you ſhall offer hym, it maie not bee doubted, but he will refuſe to bee kyng, to plaie with, or taſt of the aple, or cherie, and that; for that tofore, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe thereof hath taſted: So fareth it with manne, who if he be demaunded, whiche he moſte affecteth, or riches, or learnyng, he at firſte will deſire, to be maiſter of money, ignoraunt, and leſſe wetyng, that the learned onely, and he alone is riche, and father, that it alſo is neceſſarie, that the ſage ſtill order, and gouerne his countrie, and that alſo without knowledge, honour is not honoured, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

becometh a note of ignominie, and ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, and that greate wealthe alſo without good letters, is the true pathe to ſenſlis brutalitie, the roote of preſumption, and accompliſhemente of ruſticitie: but the wiſe ſufficeth to directe hymſelf, and others, poſſeſte of theſe threaſures, that neuer maie faile hym. But this all happeneth vnto manne, for not knowyng, to what ende he is borne. The ſecond is, the immoderate vſe of pleaſures, of the minde, as well as alſo of the bodie, whiche bothe annoye, and droune, no leſſe the exteriour motions to vertue, then the interiour alſo, and theſe of the ſpirite. So that manne ſo folded in the filthe of this worlde, maie well bee reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to the doughter of a Prince, faire, and beautifull, to whom alſo appertained after her father, the kyngdome, but for hauyng committed fornication, with a bond man deformed, and odious, is depriued thereof, to her eternall infamie. The thirde iſſueth of the euill diſpoſition in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes bodie, whence manne, of learnyng, and good letters, for the moſte parte is incapable: and this ſome tymes is cauſed, by the place of his birthe, whence he taketh to be, of an imperfecte, and impure complexion, as in certaine countries in the Eaſt, where, as in partes of <hi>Africa,</hi> men are borne ſo ſenſlis, and beſtiall, by meane of the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of heate in theſe ſoiles, that thei liue as brute bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, incapable of reaſon: and on the other ſide, in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries <hi>Septentrionall,</hi> or Northe, in other ſome places, by extreame coldnes, are menne borne, ſo wilde, and ſauage that ſome of them refuſe not, to feede on mannes fleſhe, ſuche are the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and <hi>Oſtrogothes,</hi> with others. And theſe people maie be compared to an Egle, in whoſe foote there is faſtened a ſtone, of ſome waight, whiche letteth her, there to flie, where by nature ſhe deſireth, to wete, aboue the cloudes, in the ſupreme, and higheſte, region of the aire. The fowerth is the difficultie, and hardnes of the ſciences, for though man ſee, that in harte, and minde he deſire, to ſearche the truthe, and cauſes, of haute, and
<pb facs="tcp:12963:191"/>
profounde matters, yet findyng theim ſo labourous, and harde to vnderſtande, he vtterly giueth ouer his firſte at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte, and enterpriſe, and becometh like vnto an iye, whiche to looke on the Sunne, faſteneth it ſelf cloſely, whence iſſueth ſuche a pearſyng, and extreame brighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that it ſo eclipſeth, and troubleth the ſight, that it in no wiſe is able to looke thereon, or abide it. The laſte, and worſte of all the others is, a certaine affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche manne hath conceiued in his youthe, eſpecially in theſe thynges, in whiche he hath been foſtered, and bredde vp, with long continuaunce afterwarde in theſame, for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome eaſily conuerteth it ſelf into Nature, by occaſion whereof, there groweth in manne, a moſte aſſured deſire and ſinguler loue in theſe thynges, where vnto he hath been vſually accuſtomed, hatyng, and diſdainyng conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually the contrary: and in this errour the whole worlde is this daie almoſte drouned. For ſee we not the ſame, in the yong children of the Turkes, which before thei come to be of iudgemente, or reaſon, abhorre, and deteſte all chriſtianitie, as doeth alſo the Iewe. Againe we ſee, that the peaſaunte, or countrie manne, for hauyng been nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and accuſtomed to the countrie, dieted, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiled groſſely, as is their maner, flieth, and refuſeth the acquaintance, or companie of the courtier, as alſo of theſe others, that liue in well ordered, and ciuill citees: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <note place="margin">A prouerbe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Frenchmen.</note> riſeth this prouerbe, vnhappie is that birde, that was bredde in an euill vale, for hauyng been foſtered, and ſtill kepte in theſame, ſhe can not at any tyme depart thence, and leaue it, though aſſured to bee els where better, and at more eaſe. Neither in this caſe onely, haue we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here of, but farther our ſelues hate ſtraungers, and theſe of an other countrie, yea, though we neuer liued in their companie, or ſawe them, onely perchaunce, for that we haue heard euill of theim.

leſſe profitable, or honeſt, yet maie thei in no wiſe learne, or receiue the contrary. Finally this loue, of vſe, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, with the diſlikyng of that wee knowe not, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte generally ſeen, in all thynges of election. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſte baniſhe from vs, euery theſe impedimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, to the ende we maie knowe (if it bée poſſible) perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to iudge, in caſes of difference: for in theſe thynges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But in this our age, it now is, ſo common, and ſo abuſed, that euery priuate, and meane Souldiour, for little cauſe, or ſmall matter is redie to attempte the cumbate againſt his aduerſarie. And that whiche geueth me greateſt cauſe of meruaile, is to ſée that Chriſtian princes, and none others admitte it, to whom, aboue all others it expreſly is, prohibited and denied, and yet gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth it ſtill, to be ſuche, and ſo common, that if God for his greate mearcies ſake extinguiſhe not the memorie thereof, I feare me, that prelates, and churche men, will not ſhame at the laſte as valiaunt champions to enter the liſtes among others. This kinde of fight is denied man, firſte, and eſpecially by gods worde, it alſo is denied hym by the Ciuile, and Canon lawe, it is denied, I ſaie, to the partie that demaundeth it, alſo to hym that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth, or aucthoriſeth it, and in fine to all ſuche as would looke on, or beholde it By Gods worde we proue it, in this ſorte to be denied. Euery acte by whiche GOD may bee tempted, is to a Chriſtian expreſly prohibited, for it is writen thou ſhalte not tempte thy Lorde, thy God. That God is tempted by this meanes, this make I it euident. To make proofe of theſe thinges, whiche by none other meanes, might be brought to good ende, but by the onely prouidence, and iuſtice of God, is no thinge els, but to proue, and tempte God, as is ſinne in caſes of purgation, wherit euermore is moſt plain, and euident, that accordyng vnto the order of nature, the ſtrongeſt, and moſt valiant ouertroweth the weaker: but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie (whiche is that the leſſe able ſhoulde conquire the other) neuer chaunſeth but by miracle onely.

Againe we maie in like ſorte proue it by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: when the lawe inhibiteth any thing, it alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiteth in any wiſe to doe that, by meanes of whiche a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maie committe the thinge inhibited, ſith then to vs, by God him ſelſelfe, murther is nenied, the cumbate is alſo by the ſame reaſon denied, for that therby is committed homicide. Or other wiſe againe it might bee ſaide in this ſorte: in holy wrete is forbidden euerie acte that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not with charitie, whiche is the ſole grounde, and foundation of vertue, but the cumbate is an acte, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth not with charitie, charitie beyng none other, but the loue of God, and our neighbour, therfore the cumbate in holy write is forbidden, for who ſo entereth the liſtes, thirſteth as is euident, the bloodde of his neighbour, trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly rebellyng, and diſobaiyng the diuine maieſtie. Finally it alſo is forbiden by the Canon lawe, for that it followeth the rule of the Scriptures in all thinges: by that reaſon then that it is prohibeted in the one, it alſo is prohibited, and forbidden in the other. By the lawe of reaſon it alſo is prohibited, for whatſoeuer is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or repugnant to naturall equitie, is by the lawe of reaſon alſo prohibited, whiche reaſon ſtandeth grounded on naturall equitie: and natural equitie willeth, that the ſame that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth the crime, ſhould for the ſame crime alſo be puniſhed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> innocente not hurte, or annoied in any thing, but the contrarie is ofttymes ſéen and knowen in this caſe.

Alſo in this ſorte may we argue againſte it, no man ought to purchaſe to hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe honour, or profite, by the detriment of an other: or this, no man ought to wiſhe to an other, that whiche hée coulde not be contented, to wiſhe to hymſelfe: but in the cumbate is euident both the one, and the other, for that who ſo demaundeth it, ſearcheth his owne glorie, by the ignomious deprauation, and detrimente of an other, to wete of hym againſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he fighteth, his neighbour: and wiſheth alſo to hym, that whiche he, in déede, leſſe would to hymſelfe, I meane both to ſubdue, and kill hym. The cumbate is therefore vtterly to bee refuſed. Out of the Ciuill law, we alſo in this ſorte maie argue: the law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiteth euery acte, by which iuſtice either is, or maie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denied to any, but in this caſe it eftſones is denied to the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for he falleth in the liſtes, &amp; his aduerſary trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth, by the ſaide lawe therefore it cometh to be denied.</p>

death, as ſhall bee here after ſaide, for that ſhe eftſones failed, with ſuch conuenient oportunitie to miniſter her potions, as her ſelfe ſtill deſired, and at laſt ſuſpected and taken with the maner, was not able to excuſe her ſelfe, with manifeſte proofes, conuicted of that folly. Whence <hi>Caluia</hi> the mother of the tyranne, whiche more then fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hated her, and as a woman of fell, and mearciles courage, perſwaded with her ſoonne to execute her in moſt ſhearpe, and cruell maner. But the greate loue that <hi>Nicocrate</hi> baere her, with her aſſured conſtancie, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant courage on the other ſide, aunſweryng ſo wiſely to euery her accuſers, cauſed that her death was not haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued: howbeit after long and many examinations, beyng moſte plainly, and apertly conuicted, not able to excuſe her ſelfe, but that ſhe had prouided it, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the iudges, ſhe boldly ſaide this much. I confeſſe my Lorde, and huſebande, that this drincke by me was, and by none other prouided, of purpoſe to haue geuen, or beſtowed it on you, but not that I euer thought, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe knew that it was either noiſome, or venemous, but continually I ſuppoſed it to be a confection amorous, for ſeyng that I was enuied of ſundrie Ladies, and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lewemen, eſpecially for that it pleaſed you ſo well to thincke of me, as alſo for that they ſee me aduaunced in honour aboue theim, and doubtyng leaſte they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure you, by ſome meanes alſo to fauour theim, I proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this potion, to increaſe, and continue your good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towardes me.

Thus ſhe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:12963:194"/>
with a ſober countenance, and like grace, in defence of her ſelfe, ſemed of parte to haue ſatiſfied, and contented the tyranne, wherefore, he would not that ſhe ſhould in any wiſe bee doone to death, but commaunded, that ſhe ſhould bee laide on the racke, where through tormente ſhe might aunſwere a truthe to eache demaunde. <hi>Caluia</hi> now prouided with diligence the rancke, doyng her to be tormented in moſte cruell maner, beſides that her ſelfe alſo in perſon leafte not to plaie her parte therein, vntill at the laſte ſhe was as werie, as was poſſible for her to be.

Wherfore preuely by letters, and meſſengers ſent him, ſhe perſwaded with <hi>Anabe</hi> a <hi>Lybian</hi> borne, a capitaine

couragious, and verie fortunate (ſeiyng that ſhe had not yet deliuered her countrie from tyranny, mindyng alſo to diſpatche hym as the other) to enter in armes on the territories of <hi>Leander,</hi> whiche he did, and being entered, with his whole armie, ſhe calleth <hi>Leander,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly telleth him, that neither were his capitaines equall either in experience, or prowes to theſe of the ennimie, and that it ſhould alſo leſſe aduauntage hym, to muche to truſte, or affie in his people, not yet ſo ſurely planted, as he ſuppoſed, in that citie, wherefore her aduiſe was, that he ſhould by all meanes, labour to pacifie, and appeace the wroth of <hi>Anabe,</hi> promiſing that her ſelf would finde ſome waie for hym, gently, and quietly to conferre at ful with hym. This counſell of his mother in lawe pleaſed well <hi>Leander,</hi> by meanes where of ſhe laboured, to bring theim both together: howbeit, before the time of meting appointed, ſhe ſente certeine aſſured, and ſecreate meſſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers to <hi>Anabe,</hi> humbly intreatyng hym, that when <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> came to hym, that he either would kill hym, or at the leaſte retaine hym priſoner, promiſing to requite hym therefore, to his full contentation.
