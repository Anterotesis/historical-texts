            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Novv in regard of his duty, both to God and the King, and also of his speciall Oath of allegiance, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent sayth, he could doe no lesse then that vvhich he did in vvriting his booke, being provoked thereunto by an enimie of both. And so much the rather, because himself and all Christians are commanded to give a reason of their hope, to vvhomsoever shall demand it of them, &amp; earnestly to contend for the faith vvhich vvas once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto the Saincts: he saith, in all these respects he could doe no lesse in ansvvering that Popeling then that he did, by giving unto God the right of his government in the hearts &amp; consciences of men, &amp; taking it from the Pope that Vicar rather of hell then of Christ, &amp; by giving the King that jurisdiction and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Novv, Divine constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath made Bishops and Presbyters or Elders a like and equall, vvhich that it might the better appeare, the Defendent propounded there tvvo things to be proved. The first vvas, That Bishops and Presbyters vvere by the Word of God one and the same. Secondlie, That Presbyters had equall Autoritie of Government<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; Excommunication vvith Bishops vvherein onely consists their preeminency &amp; Autoritie above their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren vvhich things being proved: it vvill necessarilie follovv, That the Pope of Rome as he is Bishop doth no vvay exceed other Bishops, and Presbyters they being in all things a like and equall unto him, much lesse hath any Autoritie and povver over Kings and Emperours. And for the proofe of the first position, the vvords Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter &amp; Bishop do sufficientlie evince i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

The Apostle Paul to Titus in the first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth sufficientlie shew, vvhere the words Bishop &amp; Presbyter are confounded. And likevvise in the first Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Peter and the fift Chapter, there Presbyter and Bishop signifie one and the same thing. And the Epistl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and diverse other places might be produced dilucidating the same thing. But the 20<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Acts puts all out of controversie, where Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Bishop signifie one &amp; the same thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is signifyed by those tvvo expressions. Neither is there a confusion of their names, with a difference still of their functions &amp; administrations, as some vvould cavill: for in these places vvhere Presbyters are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bishops, the disputation is not about the title, but about the office signified and specified by the title. For vvhen S. Paul exhorts the Presbyters to have an eye to their duty &amp; charge, he useth this reason, that the Holy Ghost had made them Bishops<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is so evident, that the Rhemists themselves, as learned men as any Bishops in England, and as able to mayntayne an error, are forced ingen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> so that for the first position, it is not onely by the Word of God clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie evident, but by the very confession of the adversaries of the trueth granted, as a thing without controversy. Novv for proofe of the second position, that Presbyters as vvell as the Bishop of Rome, have the povver and right of Government, Ordination and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by vvhich in these times Bishops onely exceed. Presbyters, the defendent vvill here brieflie demonstrat it, referring those of this honorable Court, that have a desire to search into the full trueth of it, to his booke. And for proofe that the Government vvas committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and that they exercised the same, it is most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous out of the first of Timothie 5. vvhere the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sayth, The Presbyters that rule vvell are vvorthie of double honour, especially those that labour in Word and Doctrine. By this testimonie it is evident, that they had rule and government in their hands. And that they had povver also of ordination and imposition of hands, it is likevvise apparent out of the first Epistle of Paul to Ti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mothy the first Chapter. For the Apostle speaking to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy sayth, Doe not neglect the gift that is in thee vvhich is given thee for prophesy by the imposition of the hands of the Presbyterie. Here allso the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had the right of imposition of hands. And that they had the povver of Excommunication and Absolution, it is likevvise manifest from the 5. of the 1. of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians and the 2. Chapter of the 2. Epistle, vvhere the Apostle gives them the povver of casting the inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous person out, and upon his repentance receiving of him in againe. By all vvhich Autorities of sacred vvrit it is sufficiently cleare and evident, That the Presbyters had the Autoritie and povver of government and rule in the Church, vvith the facultie also and abilitie of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; excommunication, and all this by Divine institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and expresse vvords of holy Scripture, hovvsoever this right and their due, vvas through the fraud and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Bishop of Rome, and Romish Bishops after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards taken avvay from the Presbyters. Wherefore the Defendent concluded<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> That if there were any difference betweene Presbyters and the Bishop of Rome (which hee denyed) that then the Presbyters in dignitie and honour exceeded, and that greatly the Bishop of Rome &amp; Romish Bishops, for all these Privileges of governement, <hi>ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for farther illustration and proofe of this, the Defendent, with many other Arguments proved, That Presbyters were better men then the Bishop of Rome, if there were any difference. The summe of which hee desire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>They who are most obedient to the Precepts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Presbyters are more obedient to the Commands of Christ, and doe more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obey the Apostles admonitions then the Romish Bishops.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Therefore they are more worthy &amp; excellent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the major, no man can deny, that knovves loyall and obedient Subiects to their Prince and his Officiers just commands, are to bee preferred before Rebels, and them that regard neither of both. Novv Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles have commanded, That all Ministers should feed the Flock of Christ deligently in preaching of the vvord, &amp; administration of the Sacraments, and that they should not be Lords over his inheritance; Both which precepts and prohibitions the Presbyters do more exactly observe then Romish Bishops: for they neither preach themselves nor will let others, and are Lords over Christs inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which the Lord Iesus and his Apostles have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the name of Presbyter or Senior, is &amp; hath beene ever a name of Honour and dignitie, and a title of mightie Emperors and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the name of Bishop is a name and title of labour and travell.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ergo, it is to be preferred before it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the major, the adversaries cannot deny it, For they conclude and establish the precedency and preminency of Peter, before the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her Apostles, because he is often first named. And for the minor, the vvord of God declares it illustriously, as may be seene in the 20. of the Acts, and the first of Titus, and the fif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er and Bishop being ioyned together, Presbyter is ever first named. To all this, Peter calls himselfe a Presbiter. The same doth Saint Iohn, as if all Ecclesiasticall dignity vvere placed in that name. But there are many arguments yet remayning to prove the dignitie of Presbyters to bee above that of Bishops, if there be any difference betvveen them. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They to whom in the most difficult controversies of the Church, and greatest dissentions, the Primitive Christians had ever recourse, and who the spirit of God did in a special maner assist, and who made Decrees by which the Church of God to this day is to be regulated and governed, and who the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves made their sociats and companions in both Generall and Provinciall Counsels, and the which had the next place unto the Apostles in their Assemblies: they are more worthy, and to be had in greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and veneration then the other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Church, which are neither by name nor place knowne in those holy mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Presbyters are such, and</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the Presbyters are more worthy and excellent then Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the major, the adversaries cannot doubt of that, vvhich bestovv dignity and honour upon their Bishops, according to the place and degree they had in the first Councels. And for the minor, none can doubt of it, vvho hath read the 15 of the Acts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and the twentyeth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the same book: But they that desire to be satisfied concerning this argument at large, the Defendent desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vvould read any of his books<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Lastly, That the dignity of the Presbyters may yet appeare, above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he title of Bishops, it is thus evident:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Those to whom the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven by name are committed, those are more vvorthy &amp; honorable then those tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> have not that Priviledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for the Presbyters, they have the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Keys granted unto them by name:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo, the Presbyters are more honorable then Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the major, no good Christian vvill or rationall man can deny it. And for the minor, he that readeth the last of Iames shall finde it manifestly enough confirmed and proved. By all vvhich Arguments, the Defendent did sufficiently beat dovvne the Bishop of Romes autority, and by the very light of reason overthew it. For if that every Presbyter be by the word of God as good a man as the Bishop of Rome if not better; and vvithall, if the Presbyters neither can nor may usurp autority over their fellovv brethren, much lesse may they doe it over Kings and Emperors, and by consequence and necessity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it follovve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, that the Bishop of Rome hath no cause to arrogate such autority to himselfe over the vvhole Church as he doth: and therefore that his rule &amp; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a meere usurpation and an abominable tyranny over the vvhole Church of God, and ought of all men to be defyed, abominated, and abhorred vvith all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, as impious and blasphemous against, God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> And therefore he could not but take it unkindly, that when in this combat they should have helped him against the common enimie, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending him, fell upon the poore Defendent, to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, saying, that he meant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hem, and that he vvas erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and factious in his opinions. Novv if the Defendent hath erred in the discussing of these truthes, the Scripture, that Word of Life, hath brought him to it, vvhich vvere blasphemie to thinke; and therefore vvhen they adjudged his booke to be burnt, they might as vvell have burnt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that the integritie of the defendent may yet more clearlie appeare, he most humbly entreateth this Illustrious Tribunall to heare hovv the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines vvas carried against him at his Araignment before the Prelats Barre at Lambeth, and hovv submissively he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned himself there, and hovv superciliously they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

themselves towards the Defendent on the contrary side. When it came to his part to speake for himselfe, the Advocat having formerly denied to plead his case any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then about the vvitnesses testimonie, vvhich he also did very jejunely, beeing an Advocate of such excellent parts of learning and eloquence as he vvas, and also at the Bar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then he told them the occasion of his vvriting of it, that he vvas provoked thereunto by a Pontifician, vvho often had dared him into the list of dispute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> last he could not deny, as he vvas a Christian, and as he vvas a Subiect; for by the Word of God he told them, and by the Law of the Land, and his speciall oath, he vvas bound unto it; vvhich Oath he also read at large in open Court, the vvhich also all the Bishops of England, and all the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Kingdome had taken, and vvere equally bound vvith him to observe. Then before he entred into the combat vvith the adversarie, he shevved, vvhat caution he used that being to vvrite against the Bishop of Rome &amp; Italian Bishops, it vvas onely as they arrogate their au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, had; and received (or at leastvvise ought so to doe) their autoritie &amp; jurisdiction over their brethren from him; For proofe of vvhich, he cited &amp; read pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly the Statuts and Acts of Parlament as follow:</p>
            <p>First, that of the first of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memorie, vvherein the Oath of Allegiance vvas ratifyed, In the which Statute there are these words, That all juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, all Superiorities, and all Privileges and Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies spirituall and temporall are annexed to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Crovvne, vvhich by Oath he being bound to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He read also the Statute made in the first of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, in these vvords; That all jurisdiction and Autori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that vvhosoever did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge and venerate this autoritie, that the same men are <hi>ipso facto</hi> in a praemunire, &amp; under the Kings high displeasure and indignation; as the vvords of the Statute run, and the mouth of the lavv speaks: and then vvith some reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> also vvhich the Defendent produced, besides the Word of God, hee shevved, That no Romish Bishops had autoritie over their fellovv brethren, nor could <hi>jure divino</hi> challenge it, much lesse over Kings and Emperors: and therefore so long as the defendent had the Word of God, the Lavves of the Kingdome, and reason it self on his side, he told them, he thought himself reasonably secure from all danger in that place. And then applying his speech unto the right honorable and noble Lord the Earle of Dorset then present, the Defendent tolde his honour, that he could not but vvonder, that hee should stand there at the Barr as a Delinquent, for mayntayning the Religion established by publick Autority, the honour of the King, and the glory of his Majestie: and that one <hi>Chouny</hi> a Sussex man a laick as vvell as himselfe, should vvrite a Booke and set it forth by publicke autoritie, mayntayning the Church of Rome to be a true Church, and never to have had so much in her, as the suspition of error in fundamentall poynts, and that this booke should be dedicated to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of Canterbury, &amp; patrionized by him (vvhich Book<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the third place the Bishop of London advanced forwards, speaking very loud and temerarious words against the Holy Scriptures saying, That he had thought to have found some great Matters in the Defendents booke, seeing him so confident and so peremptory, but diligently reading of it, he met with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it but Scripture, which, as he sayd, was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of all Schismeticks &amp; Hereticks; &amp; so according with his predecessors in their opinion and censure, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his part of speech.

And yet it is not altogether denyed, but that the perswasion and report of men may be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to stirre up men many times to the hearing &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usell of a thing, which of it self doth not alwayes beget faith or but very little as dayly experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us, but the thing it selfe seene or heard, is that that worke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> never thought themselves worthy of so great dignity as to suppose that any honour came unto the Scriptures from their interpretations and expositions, who in their writings frequently exhort their Readers not to listen what they say, but what the Scriptures of the Prophets and Apostles speake in them, and no farther to receive their autority and doctrine, then it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the holy Scriptures, &amp; expressions to this purpose, the Defendent saith, he could accumulate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite out of the Fathers, which for brevity he omitteth, fearing to be over tedious, though it be a matter of greatest importance.</p>

&amp; testimony of their doctrine from the Scriptures &amp; not as novv the Prelats doe, preposterously bringing autority to the Scriptures from the interpretation of the Fathers according to their ovvne sense.

And in the 23 chapter vers. 6. he sayth: Be yee therefore very couragious to keepe and to doe all that is written in the Booke of the Law of Moses, that you turne not asides therefrom, to the right hand nor to the left. And Christ himselfe our great Master sayth Ioh. 5. vers. 38. Search the Scriptures, for in them yee thinke to have eternall life, &amp; they testifie of mee. And in the 3. of the Acts ver. 22, 23. S. Peter brings all men unto Christ to be taught by him, not in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things onely, but that Prophet must be heard in all things, and no other in Gods matters must be listened unto, the words are these: For Moses truely sayd unto the Fathers, a Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your brethren, like unto mee, him shall you heare in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shal come te passe, that every Soule, which will not heare that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. And in the 12. of Iohn vers. 48. our Saviour sayth: He that rejecteth mee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not my Words, hath one that judgeth him: the Word that I have spake, the same shall judge him in the last day. And therefore doth it not stand with all good reason that we should guide &amp; square our lives and actions by that word and rule onely, by which we shall at the last day be judged? Paul in the 2. of the Rom. ver. 16. sayth, That the secrets of mens hearts shall at that day be judged according to his Gospell, &amp; shall not all our doctrines yea and our whole Religion be squared and regulated by the same? all good reason vvould dictate so.

               </gap>, not the use &amp; customes of former ages, if they dissent from the holy Scriptures and vvritten word of God. For the great Doctor of his Church telleth the Saduces, saying, Yee erre, not knovving the Scriptures, Matth. 12. vers. 24. &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from the ignorance of the Scriptures commeth all error, they that follovv the Scripture for their guide, can never stray or straggle from the right vvay, neither have they need to borrovv the candle of the Fathers to be directed by, so long as the glorious Sun of the vvord shineth so clearly, and it was the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall praise and commendations of the more noble Bereans that they did dayly search the Scriptures vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things the Apostles taught, vvere so or no. Acts 17, ver. 11. and Paul is greatly honored vvith this applause in the 26. of the Acts ver. 22. that he taught no other things, then those vvhich the Prophets and Moses did say should come te passe. And so Christ taught his Apostles Luc. 24, that all things ought to be fullfilled concerning him vvhich vvere vvrit in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the Prophets and the Psalmes.</p>
            <p>So that the Scriptures alone are the Foundation of all our religion; and to say that the meaning of the Scriptures can not be knowne without the Fathers, is an unsufferable wickednes done unto that holy booke, and an infinite contempt and disgrace of it, to say it hath need of the ayde of man to support it, Christ vanquished the Devill by the Scriptures Matth. 4. dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve away the Saduces Matth. 22, and S. Iames, by the Scriptures put an end unto the great controversy of the Churches at Ierusalem, &amp; set the Churches of the Gentiles free for ever from all Ceremonyes vvhatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but those God himselfe had appoynted, Acts 15. and onely by the Scriptures did Paul resolve all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions. So that according to Gods ovvne instruction and direction vvhich must ever be obeyed and liste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto, the Scriptures onely &amp; soly must bee the Iudge, Law, square &amp; rule of all our religion, vvords, &amp; actions. Not the Autority of the Fathers, not the traditions of men, not the practice &amp; custome of the ancient and the name of Antiquity. For they that shall preferre these things before the Word of God, or at least affirme that these Holy Oracles and Divine records cannot be understood vvithout the Fathers, do not only blasphemously disgrace and contemne the Holy Scriptures, but neglect the great Prophet vvhom vve ought to heare in all things, so that liste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto the voice of men before the vvords of this great Prophet, &amp; accusing the Scriptures of obscurity and saying they are the refuge of all Schismaticks and Hereticks, is great impiety &amp; contumacy against God, &amp; most injurious to the Holy Scriptures. All which the Prelats being so highly guilty of, the Defendent will never be a frayd to charge them with it, that they are disgracers &amp; contemners of Holy Scripture: withall that they are very ungratefull to the King their master, &amp; invaders of his Prerogative Royall; all which he shall make also evidently appeare to this honorable Court, and how unwor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For by the Lawes &amp; Statuts specified before with many others, it is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly inacted, That whatsoever Autority is here

exercised under the King, in his Dominions, whether it be Spirituall or Temporall, whether by Archbishops, Bishops or any Ecclesiasticall men, it is meerly in, by, and from the King, and so ought to be acknowledged; and that all jurisdictions, superiorities; all privileges and preeminencies spirituall and Ecclesiasticall, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed unto the Imperiall Crowne, &amp; so to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. And whosoever doth not acknowledge, that all jurisdiction and Autoritie both Spirituall and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall is derived and doth flow immediatly from the Kings Majest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it is the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Princes and the priviledge that onely agrees to Kings and Potentates to be absolute in their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and that all other jurisdictions &amp; superiorityes exercised by any other in their Kingdomes, are derived from them, and that of themselves they have none, but as from the Kings. So that it is arbitrary and in the Princes power to have or not to have such jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and preeminencies under them: And that they may abdicat or annihilate them when they please. And whosoever shall deny this, or clayme any right of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to themselves in Princes Dominions <hi>jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi> are delinquents against their Kings and Masters: and by our Lawes and Statutes they are proclaymed enimyes of the King and his Prerogative Royall, &amp; that is true, the mouth of the Law hath spake it. And therefore the Defendents booke cannot be called a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, without the Lawes first be proclamed such: for the lawes say, That all such persons as shall challenge any Autority unto themselves in his Majest. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions but from the King are delinquents against his Majest. and invaders of his prerogative Royall, &amp; his Highnesses enimyes, and so they are. Now that the Prelats are such, they sufficiently declared it in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Defendent. For he reading the Statuts at the Barr, they notwitstanding affirmed, that they had not their Autority and jurisdiction from the King, but that Iesus Christ made them Bishops, and bestowed their Autority upon them, and that they were <hi>jure Divino</hi>; and that they were before Christian Kings, &amp; held the Crovvnes of Kings upon their heads; for no Bishop no King, and all this in a publick Court of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature and in a most crouded assembly: So that it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the King is beholding to them, and not they to his Majest. And if this bee not to invade the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and to be enimyes of it, and to be ungratefull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Highnes, the Defendent knovveth not what it is to bee enimies of the prerogative. The Lavves say it; and therefore if the Defendent hath erred, the Lavves have brought him into this error. Neither did the Prelats ovvne Words at the Bart onely, declare their disloyalty to the King, and their independency on him, but this very information vvhich comes from the Prelats in the name of the Attorney Generall, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, demonstrates it.

            <p>But the thing that the Defendent desireth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Court, to take notice of, is, the contumacy of the Prelats: for they call their Hierarchy, and the Orders of their Bishops, Priests and Deacons, Sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither is there such a president of wrong and cruelty in the whole world, that any man of what ranke, order or degree soever he be, that shall write a Booke in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that religion that is established by publick Autority, for the honour of the King &amp; in Defence of his prerogative against a common enimy that for this indeavour of his should be ruined, he, his wife, &amp; children cast into prison, deprived first of all possibility of livelyhood, rayled upon, &amp; reviled publickly, and after all this given to the Devill, and that onely for writing a Booke which had nothing in it but Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and in the which the Defendent thought they meant him; and that they should still prosecute him &amp; seek his eares and the defacing of him, which they threaten.

men, that come under their jurisdiction, the same may be sayd and proved by thousands, whether one respect their soules, bodyes, or goods, for they use cruelty in regard of all, sparing neither age or sex, poore or rich, youg or old, bond, or free: but upon every triviall occasion, or for the meanest neglect of any one of their idlest and impious Ceremonies, or for any misprision, it is enough to have them hoisted into the High Commission Court, &amp; brought from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest parts of the Kingdome, to the utter undoing of them &amp; their familyes, when as the greatest breach of any of the Commandements of the first table, is not once thought of.</p>
            <p>And in the bringing of them into troubles they deale with those poore men as they doe with Beares &amp; Bulls at Paris Garden: they first, by violence, and their Officers to their mightie expenses hale them into their Courts, and then with bands of two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds they tie them to their stakes &amp; bait them three or foure yeares together with all maner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelyes &amp; reproaches, vexations, expenses, calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; torments; till they have wearied them to death, and made their lives tedious unto them, &amp; after all this they fling him into one jayle or other destitute of friends &amp; monies.

            <p>In like maner doe the Prelats &amp; their complices in these our times deale with poore honest Christians and the true and faithfull servants of the Lord, and the Kings most loyall Subiects, they make them mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, ugly and deformed unto all men, King &amp; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, by their relations and informations they cloth them with: saying of them, That they are maligners and enimies of government, troublers of Church and State, Seducers of the Kings Subjects, making them disloyall unto their Prince, stirrers up of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; faction, and a thousand such crimes, setting all the people against them &amp; in their open Courts have their orators to blanch over their defamatory false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea in the very Court-Sermons they incense the King &amp; Nobles dayly against those, they brand with the name of Puritans and Sectaries, which all this honorable Assembly can witnes; and the Defendent hath heard many Court-Sermons with his owne eares in the time of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but never heard one where the Puritans as they terme them, were not brought up in the Pulpit, &amp; most shamefully &amp; unchristianly traduced, as those that opposed the Kings proceedings, and such as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne his government and trouble the peace of Church and State, and humbly besought his Majest. that some severe course might bee sought &amp; taken against them.</p>
            <p>These &amp; such like sprincklings of their brotherly Rhetorick the defendent himselfe hath often heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can this honorable Court be ignorant of the truth of this. And what is all this but great cruelty &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice to abuse thus their brethren by malicious and false accusations, to the incensing of their Gracious King and Soveraigne against them; when they are most innocent &amp; harmlesse, desiring nothing more then the life, safety, prosperity &amp; happines of his Majesty and of his royall progeny &amp; his florishing rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne, and would lose ten thousand lives if they had them for the honour of his crowne &amp; dignity? for they desire nothing more then to bee found loyall; neither do they seeke any thing more then the peac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is the cruelty they dayly use in respect of their bodies, lives and estates. But yet their cruelty is greater in respect of their soules, for they have through the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>VVales</hi> taken away allmost all their glorious paynfull Ministers, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And which is yet more to be observed, in the same Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme children promise there by their God-Fathers and God-Mothers, or they doe it for the children to be baptized; that they will forsake the Devill and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and are there signed with the signe of the Crosse, that innocent Ceremony, as they call it, that he shall continue Christs Faithfull Souldier &amp; fight under his banner all the dayes of his life against the World, the Flesh and the Devill, by the which promise he is bound to the utmost of his power al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to oppose all errors, wickednes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> cause, as they all were: this the Defendent saith is unrighteous dealing, to which may bee added the defending of the Popes quarrell, to condemne him for one thing and putting those things likewise in the records of the Court, for which by the whole Court he was freed from. As for example, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendent was condemned onely for his booke, now in the order of the Court or Sentence, it is put in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>Now they condemned the Defendent for writing against the Pope, &amp; adjudged his Booke to be burnt, and justified his adversaries and <hi>Chouny</hi> who writ in defence of the Church of Rome; and it is their daily practice to condemne bookes that are writ for the Honour of Religion, accusing them to bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious pamphlets: but Bookes that are writ for the advancement of Poperie and Superstition, and in defence of the Pontificalitie of Prelats and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Church of Rome, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and such as extoll the Church of Rome patronized by them and maintained. And what is it then to advance Poperie, if all these doings of the Prelates bee not? and what is it to favour prophanesse and irreligion, if the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing and silencing of those that write and speake against the iniquitie of the times, be not? let all men judge of this with serious reason, and they will soone perceive, that in this accusation of the Prelats, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendent hath no way wronged them. And for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and want of wit, it is notoriouslie also knowne who raile most shamefully and unhumanelie upon all honest men that come before them, as their very speeches in their censure may witnes. Iudges of old were wont to give Sentence in lesse matters beeing full of compassion, with teares in their eyes; neither doe wee read of any Iudges since Christs time but of Ananias the High Priest, and Festus the Governor that they ever did revile those that were brought before them, or give them any ill language. And the one was a Iew, and the other a Heathen, both enimies of Christ and Christians. But for Christian Iudges and them spirituall ones, for such contumeliouslie to abuse their brethren, as they did the Defendent, and dailie doe others, and to give them over to the Devill and to perpetuall chaines for every triviall thing, yea even for a misprision or a very surmise, and to make a man an offender for a word, and to ruine them, their wives, and children for such things, and that with scoffes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, tants and mocks, this the Defendent affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, in the Prelates is both crueltie, injustice, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and want of wisdome, and so hee nothing doubteth but this honorable Court and all rationall men will judge.</p>

For if wee looke upon Timothy and Titus whose successors they would be thought to bee, and the rules that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and were guided by, wee shall find a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene them.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, and how that Trajan the Emperour would not have his Subjects oppressed with it as thinking it a cruelty unsufferable. And to speake the truth, it is an oath against the Law of Nature, the Law of Nations, the Law of God, and the Law of the Land, yea the Defendent is able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute it by their owne Canon Law. But that it is against the Law of Nature and the Land it is evident: for by neither is any man forced to accuse and condemne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, &amp; a learned lawyer not long since proved it to be against the lawes of the land. And the very Heathens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned no man, but by sufficient witnesses, as wee may see when Paul was brought before Felix, hee taketh not an oath of him to accuse himselfe, buth sayth, when thy accusers come I will heare thee. Festus likewise sayd, It was not the maner of the Romans to deliver any man to dye, before that he which is accused, have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ccusers face to fave, and have licence to answer for himselfe concerning the crime layd against him. But by the oath <hi>ex officio</hi> a man is condemned without either, as all the prisons almost through the Kingdome can witnes. Nay, the law of God sayth, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every thing shall be confirmed; now here without any witnesses, a man is condemned. And Christ himselfe being questioned concerning his doctrine, he sends them to be informed of that, of those that heard him, &amp; would not in any thing answer them, &amp; when the woman was brought before him, being found in the fact of adultery he asketh her, saying where are thy accusers? They are gone sayth she, and Iesus sayd, I accuse thee not, neither did he force her to accuse her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. And Christ bids us if any man offend us, goe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell him of it privatly; and then if he heare us not, after that to take witnesses, and after conviction by witnesses then to shun him.

               </gap>ousnes, in judgment and in truth. Novv by this damnable oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> he can doe none of all this. For he knovveth not vvhat to svveare to, and by that oath he makes that evill vvhich is good many times, and that good vvhich is evill, vvhich is great unrighteousnes and untruth: he is also to accuse himselfe and his brethren, to the utter undoing of them all, vvhich is horrible injustice and vvant of vvisdom &amp; judgment.</p>
            <p>Besides, an oath by Gods ovvne appointment, is to bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is the last thing in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy and the conclusion of it, &amp; vvhere this end is not in an oath, it is not to svveare according to Gods ovvne appoyntment, but sinfully. Now the oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> is not such an oath: for that is the beginning of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestation and strife, mischief &amp; vvicked debate, and the cause of infinit brabbles and needles vexations to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
