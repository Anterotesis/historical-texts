         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>REASONS Humbly offer'd for the
Impoſition or Duty, &amp;c. to be accepted by
this Honourable Houſe.</head>
               <p>
                  <label>1ſt,</label> THE Wholeſale Trader cannot think himſelf much
prejudic'd by this Tax, by reaſon of his great
Dealings and the ſmall Impoſition or Duty propos'd;
which, in proportion, is ſo inconſiderable, that it will not
be worth any particular Perſon's notice: For there is not
one wholeſale Trader in ten, that will pay above eight
Shillings <hi>per Annum</hi> (and no one to pay above ſixteen)
which, according to their Abilities, is very reaſonable.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>2dly,</label> The Retailers, who generally return leſs Money
than the wholeſale Men, are more moderately Aſſeſſed, by
reaſon there are hardly any who make uſe of Meaſures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the Gallon, or Weights exceeding the ten Pounder;
whereby their part will be ſo ſmall, that no particular
Perſon will feel it. Yet Meaſures, as likewiſe Weights,
being ſo generally made uſe of, will bring a large Sum
of Money into the Treaſury. So that the generality
of Retailers, who make uſe of Weights or Meaſures, will
not pay (by moderate Computation) above four Shillings
<hi>per Annum,</hi> according to the quantity of Weights and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
they have occaſion to make uſe of.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>3dly,</label> The ſeveral <hi>Propoſals</hi> aformention'd cannot raiſe
any ſort of Goods or Commodity whatſoever in the leaſt, by
reaſon no particular Trade is Taxed; (but that the ſame is
laid on all ſorts whatſoever) and the Impoſition or Duty
is ſo ſmall, that there can be no pretence for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:137079:7"/>
                  <label>4thly,</label> The Impoſition upon Shopkeepers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who do
not make uſe of Weights and Meaſures, is likewiſe ſo ſmall,
that the Shopkeepers aforeſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> certainly cannot find
fault with it, ſince they pay as little as any other Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
whatſoever; and are commonly as well able to pay as
much.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>5thly,</label> The ſeveral particulars mention'd in theſe <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals</hi>
(if thought fit to be accepted by this <hi>Honourable Houſe</hi>)
may all of them be Collected by the ſame Officers all over
<hi>England.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>
                  <label>6thly,</label> The Poll-Tax on Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as propos'd) may
be Collected by Officers appointed in every particular
Pariſh throughout the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>7thly,</label> The ſame Officers may readily Diſpatch and Seal
all Weights and Meaſures, and take a particular and exact
Account thereof, and for whom; which ſaid Account
ſhall be ſent up (or a Copy) to ſome proper Perſon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
appointed for that purpoſe, to whom they ſhall ſend
the Money by them received likewiſe, which may be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Regiſter'd at an Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>8thly,</label> Theſe Officers to be Houſekeepers, or otherwiſe
Reſidents in the Pariſh where they gather and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the ſeveral Taxes as above propos'd; or the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
may Collect for ſeveral Pariſhes, as is requiſite or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>9thly,</label> The ſame Perſons being Reſidents may attend all
Fairs and Markets, who may likewiſe Regiſter and give
an Account of all Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bought and Sold, as the
ſame ſhall occur.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>10thly,</label> 'Tis humbly ſuppos'd the foregoing <hi>Propoſals</hi>
will (if worthy Acceptance) bring into His Majeſty's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:137079:8"/>
the firſt Year, by Computation, at leaſt two hundred
and fifty thouſand Pounds; and two hundred thouſand
Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> ſo long as the ſame may be continu'd.
There can be no great certainty how much more Money
this Tax will raiſe (but the number of Tradeſmen who will
be oblig'd to pay to it, are ſo great, that it may be
ſuppos'd, a far larger Sum will be brought into His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Exchequer) by reaſon the Majority of the People
of <hi>England</hi> will pay ſomething. But how many there are
to pay, or how much each Perſon will be Aſſeſſed, muſt,
at preſent, remain uncertain, by reaſon there have not been
Precedents in this nature to give a true Information.</p>
               <p>So that after <hi>Your Honours</hi> have, in Your great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
maturely conſidered the foregoing Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
in their ſeveral and particular Circumſtances,
I hope, <hi>Your Honours</hi> will paſs a favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
on the endeavours of Your Propoſer,
(who entirely aims at the Service of His Majeſty
and His Kingdom, by offering that, which <hi>Your
Honours,</hi> in Your great Wiſdom, I hope, will
Judge ſerviceable to the Nation at this juncture;
and not burthenſome to the Subjects thereunto
belonging) and according to the Merits of his
Service, he humbly begs You will grant him the
encouragement he may deſerve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
