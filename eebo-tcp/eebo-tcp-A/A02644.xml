            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, my maister hauing expresly
commaunded mee, to finish a
straunge discourse that he had
written to you, called the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorpho-sis
of AIAX, by
setting certaine pictures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
there came vnto my minde a tale I had heard,
perhaps more merry then mannerly. How a plain,
or rather a pleasant Seruingman, wayting on his
maister at the Popes Court, happened to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
one day, when the Gentleman, after long at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
and great meanes, had obtained the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to kisse his holinesse foote. The man seeing
what his maister did, first stale out of the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber,
&amp; then ranne out of the house, hiding himselfe for
a pretie space. The Gentleman hearing of it, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
his mans simplicity (who perhaps was crafty
knaue inough for all that) and asked why he went
away? Alas sir said he, when I saw that a man
of your worth and worship, in so publique a place,
might kisse but his toe, I doubted they would haue
made me, haue kist him in some homelyer place,
and so I might haue bene shamed for euer.</p>
            <p>If that seruingman had cause to runne out of
the house, my thinke I may seeme to haue more
reason, to runne out of my wits, to haue so strange
a taske appointed me; for when the verie face, &amp;
head, or title of the booke, seemed so fowle &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauerie,
<pb facs="tcp:4029:3"/>
vvhat might I thinke the feete or tayle
thereof vvere like to proue? Wherefore I would
gladly haue shunned so base an office: but hauing
my maisters exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple ioyned to his commandement,
I tooke hart to me, and first I read ouer the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
to see what was promist therein on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
(viz. certaine pictures.) But I assure you in
the reading of it, whether it were the wel ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling
of the matter, or my partiall opinion (a fault that
I am seldome charged withall) my minde was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and I compared the homely title of it, vnto
an ilfauored vizer,<note place="margin">Or to a road or a snake made in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that lookes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sightly, but tasts sweetly.</note> such as I haue seene in stage-playes,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they daunce Machachinas, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
as sweet a face sometimes as any is in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.
And euen presently therewithall, as if I had
bene inspired vvith the spirite of AIAX, me
thought I durst haue aduentured with my pen
and pensill vpon any thing. For, as the saying is,
<q>
                  <l>Painters and Poets, clayme by old enrolment,</l>
                  <l>A charter, to dare all, without controlment.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore by the Priuiledge of this Charter
(as also by a Pattent I haue of seruing two pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiships)
I vvill go somevvhat beyond the bare
wordes of my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission, and yet not swarue much
from the charge that is layd vpon me. For Sir, I
vvould you knew it, though I neuer troubled the
schooles at Oxford, with any disputes or degrees,
yet I carried there a good schollers bookes after
him, and I trust I gat some quaynt phrases amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
them, as namely in steed of praying the Cobler to
<pb facs="tcp:4029:3"/>
set two patches on my shoes, I could haue said, <hi>set
me two semicircles vpon my suppeditals,</hi>
vvith much other eloquence beyond the common
intelligence. And yet notwithstanding all these
great vaunts, I wil not take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to say so much of the Metamorpho-sis, the
Etimologie, &amp; the reformation of Don AIAX-house,
as my maister hath said, or to defend the
vvordes, illustrate the matter, and dilate of the
forme as he hath done, for vvho can stand against
such an army of Emperours, Kings, Magistrats,
Prophets, Poets, All-hallowes, and all prophanes,
euen from the Bible to the bable, as are by him
brought for enobling of his arguments? Yet for
Anatomysing as it vvere of the shape and bodie
thereof,<note place="margin">M. Plat in his booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>fol. vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo penulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</hi>
               </note> because he hath handled that point (in
M. Plats opinion) somewhat too briefly for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vnderstandings, I must heare a litle better
open it: for as the old saying is, (<hi>bonum quo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munius
eo melius</hi>) and the old verse is,
