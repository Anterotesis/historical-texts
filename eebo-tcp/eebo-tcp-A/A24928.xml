            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Account of the Book, Entituled, <hi>NOTITIA MONASTICA.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE design of this Book (now ready for the Press) is to give the World, <hi>A short History of the Religious Houses in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Wales, <hi>containing the Names and Qualities of the Founders, the time of the Foundation, the Order, Dedication and Valuations</hi> (both according to <hi>Speed</hi> and <hi>Dugdale) of all Cathedral Churches, Abbies, Priories, Priories<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Alien, Colleges, and Praeceptories.</hi> Houses of <hi>Fryers</hi> are purposely omitted, because not endowed with Lands, <hi>Chantries</hi> because they were not Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, and <hi>Hospitals,</hi> because they consisted of Lay-Brethren. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, observed in this Book, is to take the Counties according to Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betical Order, and in them to describe the Monasteries according to the Seniority of their Foundations. After the Description of every Monastery are inserted References, not only to the Tome and Page of the Monasticon, and to other Printed Books, wherein are any Memorials relating to that House, but also to all MSS. whether Original Charters, Chronicles, or Leiger-Books thereunto belonging, which are yet Preserved in any Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or private Gentleman's Custody. The Coats of Arms of the Religious Houses, as many as can be recover'd, may be Engraven on small Copper Plates, and prefixt to the Beginning of every County; to which end I have Collected almost 150, few of which were ever Publisht. There shall be annexed two Indexe's, one of the Monasteries, the other of the Founders.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speed</hi>'s Catalogue, and the <hi>Monasticon Angl.</hi> are the only Books of this nature, that were ever Printed; how defective and erroneous the former is, may be easily seen in the following Scheme: And as for the <hi>Monasticon,</hi> it is too Voluminous and Costly for the generality of Readers; and that Noble Work hath also its Mistakes, and is capable of Additions, as will appear in almost every Page of our <hi>Notitia:</hi> Which may be Printed in 20 or 30 sheets in <hi>Octavo,</hi> and so will be grateful to those who have neither leisure nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to consult, nor can spare Money enough to purchase the <hi>Monasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con;</hi> and it cannot but be acceptable and useful to those that have the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticon</hi> already, upon the account of the Additions and Corrections, the Arms, the Repertory of the Registers, and the References to the <hi>Monasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> and other Printed Histories. Tho' I do not pretend to have made this <hi>Short History of Religious Houses</hi> compleat (which can never be expected) or free from all Errors; yet, after having diligently consulted all <hi>Leland</hi>'s MSS. two MS. Catalogues of the Religious Houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I find good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to correct the following Numbers of Mistakes, and to supply these Defects in the <hi>Monasticon</hi> and <hi>Speed.</hi>
