         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God did deliuer them, and gaue them a Law, by the which he commanded them to offer to him who is the true God, in Sacrifice, all thoſe things which they did wickedly worſhip before <hi>(to wit,</hi> in Egypt) of earthly Beaſts, the Goats, the Bullockes, and Sheepe; of flying Beaſts, the Turtle and the Doue, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>God did not inſtitute Sacrifices, as hauing neede of killed Beaſts, or that hee hath any pleaſure in the ſauour of burnt fleſh: but hee did ſo of his wiſedome, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the peoples weakneſſe: euen ſo did he ſuffer Muſicall Inſtruments, <hi>to wit,</hi> in the time of the Sacrifice, not that hee would pleaſe his eares with the conſent of the ſinging of them, but that he might by little and little, draw away the deluſions of the Idols: Thus farre be the words of <hi>Theodoretus.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond point is, that the vſe of the white Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is an Inſtitution Apoſtolike: and ſeeing that the ſaid Booke of the Conſtitution of the Apoſtles maketh mention thereof, and that <hi>Iames</hi> the Lords Brother, and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt, his beloued Diſciple, did vſe the ſaid Garment, as is euident by the teſtimonies here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore cited; it followeth, that the vſe of it in our Church Seruices of England, hath for the warrant thereof the authoritie of the holy Apoſtles of Chriſt, ſo that no man which will follow the example of the Apoſtles, ſhould except anything againſt the vſe of the ſaid white Garment.</p>

Therefore, ſeeing Chriſt did neyther ſtand, ſit, nor kneele, in this holy Action, but follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cuſtome receiued, there is no neceſsitie in any of theſe geſtures, but they are indifferent: ſo that euery man ſhould follow the receiued Cuſtome in the Church where hee doth liue and dwell: And that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this geſture of kneeling was, and is yet abuſed in the Popiſh Idolatry, it was lawfully retained by the godly Reformers of the Church of England.</p>

                     <hi>Baal Baith,</hi> that is, the Maiſter of the houſe, after he had giuen thankes and bleſſed the Wine, hee beganne the Supper with a cup of wine, and after him, euery one about did emptie his cup, lying vpon their left ſide on Carpets or Cuſhens of ſilke, like ſome great Baron or noble man. After they haue eaten, the foreſaid Maiſter of the houſe doth eate of a thicke Cake, and doth diſtribute vnto the reſt ſome part of it, while they lye on their left ſide; and laſt of all, they end the whole action, with a third cup of wine, which is bleſſed, and ſo they giue thankes to God.</p>
                  <p>It is manifeſt by theſe teſtimonies, that the miſtaking of the proprietie and ſignification of the Greeke tongue, hath bred a great diuiſion, which is grounded vpon a double error. The firſt is an errour of the Hiſtory of the cuſtome obſerued in Chriſts time, inſomuch that many will not kneele, becauſe they are perſwaded that Chriſt did ſit and not kneele at the Communion.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore yee ſee it clearly proued, that Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:18543:13"/>
and his Diſciples did not ſit, but lye, according to the cuſtome of the Iewes and Gentiles in his time; it is a great errour to hold that ſitting is neceſſarily to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the holy Communion, and to abſtaine from it, vnleſſe it be performed in ſitting in our manner.</p>
                  <p>The other errour doth proceed from this, that men do enioyne neceſſitie to things which in their owne nature are indifferent: as to hold, that the geſture of the body which Chriſt did vſe in the inſtitution of the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is ſubſtantiall, and not indifferent: and therefore men ſurmiſing that Chriſt did ſit in our manner at his laſt Supper, that it is a ſubſtantiall thing to ſit at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: and on the other part, that it is vnlawfull to kneele at the Communion, becauſe Chriſt and his Diſciples did not kneele at the firſt inſtitution of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly action.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt did celebrate the Communion after Supper: now if we were bound to follow the geſture of the body which Chriſt did vſe, wee ſhould be alſo bound to the performing of this action after our Supper.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, it is to be obſerued for our inſtruction, that Chriſt, in this action, did follow the geſture of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which was brought from the Gentiles to the Iewes, againſt the preſcript of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, although it was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before Chriſts Natiuitie, to the ſeruice of Idols.</p>
                  <p>This example of Chriſt doth much concerne vs: for as Chriſt did vſe the cuſtome of lying, receiued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, to draw the Iewes &amp; Gentiles to his Church, (notwithſtanding the abuſe of it in the Idols ſeruice) euen ſo, the holy Martyrs of the Church of England, who were Reformers of the ſame, did imitate Chriſt, in retaining that cuſtome of the geſture of the body, which was in vſe in the Popiſh Church, although it was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Idolatry, to draw the Papiſts from the Idolatrous kneeling, in the Adoration of the externall Sacrament to adore Chriſt himſelfe, in receiuing the holy Sacrament of his bleſſed body and bloud.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18543:13"/>
Now ſeeing it is manifeſtly proued, that Chriſt did neyther ſit nor ſtand in executing this holy action, there it no neceſſitie in ſtanding nor ſitting. And if there were any neceſſitie, to follow preciſely the forme that Chriſt vſed, wee ſhould all lye about a Table, ſet low on the ground, as Chriſt and his Diſciples did. And therefore no man can haue any likelihood of reaſon to abſtaine from the holy Communion, vnleſſe it be adminiſtred to them ſitting at a Table, or in ſeates, or in Pewes.</p>

               <p>THE Apoſtles, and Chriſts Church founded by them, did vſe to celebrate a publike feaſt in their Aſſemblies, which was called <hi>Agape,</hi> or the Feaſt of Charitie: becauſe in it, the poore were relieued by the rich: after the which, their cuſtome was to celebrate the Lords Supper, all lying on Carpets, Cuſhens, or the like, as Chriſt did: which cuſtome continued in many places, many hundred yeeres, but the Catholike Church did change this cuſtome both of lying and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after Supper: which change is allowed of by thoſe, who in our time haue brought in the geſture of ſitting at table in receiuing the Communion. And therefore, there is no reaſon, but they ſhould as well allow of the change of lying into kneeling.</p>

                     </gap>, a great multitude of the Prieſts receiued the Faith, and in the 21. Chapter, verſe 20. <hi>Iames</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Ieruſalem, and the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters or Elders, did enforme S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that many <hi>Myriades,</hi> that is, a very great multitude of the Iewes had receiued the faith, which were all zealous obſeruers of the Law: whereof wee collect, that they did retaine Circumciſion, and the celebration of the Iewiſh Paſſeouer, together with Baptiſme and the holy Communion, after that ſame kinde of geſture of accubation as Chriſt himſelfe did: which wee haue proued before in the ſecond <hi>These.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe doth agree that which is written in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> Chap. 2. verſe 42. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that <hi>the faithfull, aſſiduè operam dabant; did continually trauell in the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and in the Communion and breaking of bread, and prayers.</hi> And in the 46. verſe of the ſaid Chapter, it is ſaid, that <hi>they continued daily in one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Temple, and breaking of bread from houſe to houſe; and did eate their meate together with gladneſſe:</hi> Whereof we may eaſily gather, that they did aſſiſt in the Temple to the Ceremonies of the Law, but in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate houſes they did daily celebrate the Communion at their ordinary feaſts, which they could not performe publikely, by reaſon of the perſecution of the Sinagogue. So that without all doubt, the geſture of their bodyes in all their publike meales was conforme to the cuſtome of the Iewes, which was <hi>accubatio,</hi> a lying downe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18543:15"/>
Alſo the Gentiles, that were conuerted, did celebrate the feaſt of <hi>Agape,</hi> and after it the holy Communion, obſeruing the geſture of accubation, as ſhall hereafter be ſufficiently (God willing) proued.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> did reproue the Corinthians, becauſe they did not lawfully obſerue the firſt inſtitution of theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like feaſts, in communicating together, the rich relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the poore: His words are theſe; <hi>When yee come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>

                     <hi>therefore into one place, this is not to eate the Lords Supper: for euery man when they ſhould eate, taketh his owne ſupper afore: and one is hungry, and another is drunke.</hi> So that yee ſee the abuſe of this feaſting was, that they did not follow the firſt inſtitution; in making their meat and drinke common to all equall: but did conuert pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like eating to priuate vſe: the rich men eating apart by themſelues, and the poore by themſelues. Therefore the Apoſtle commands them in the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that when they come to eate, they tarry one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>

Chriſt exhorteth his Diſciples often to pray, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them the forme of prayer, which we call the Lords <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 9. Luke 11.</note> Prayer: but hee doth not preſcribe any particular ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the body to be vſed when we pray, ſo that he did leaue the geſture to be obſerued according to the order and cuſtome of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Wee are commanded by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to examine our <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 27. 28 29.</note> ſelues before wee participate the Lords Supper: for if we doe not ſo, we are guiltie of Chriſts death, and wee eate our owne condemnation.</p>
                  <p>This examination of our ſelues conſiſts in the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſinnes, and ſorrow of our hearts, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to abſtaine from them, with humble prayers to God the Father through Chriſt Ieſus, that he would grant vs true Repentance, and his grace to abſtaine from our ſins, that his holy Communion may be vnto vs, an Antidote and medicine to purge vs of all the ſpirituall poyſon of ſinne and corruption, that wee be not guilty of Chriſts death, and that we eate not vnworthily to our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                  <p>Seeing that in all this tryall of our ſelues before the Communion, prayers and repentance is to be vſed: and the geſture of prayer is kneeling, as wee haue already proued by Chriſts example, it followeth, that the geſture of kneeling is the moſt conuenient and agreeable to Chriſts owne geſture.</p>
                  <p>This geſture of kneeling in prayers continued in the Apoſtles time: for the holy Martyr S. <hi>Steuen</hi> being to <note place="margin">Acts 7. 60.</note> receiue (according to the interpretation of his name) the crowne of Martyrdome, in yeeelding vp the Ghoſt, hee did pray kneeling.

                  <p>The celebration of the Communion is the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table action of our Chriſtian Religion: for, in it the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all other things is applyed to vs, and therein is repreſented Gods bleſſings, as the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, prayers, inuocations, thankeſgiuings; and laſtly, the very death of Chriſt therein is repreſented, which doth worke in vs, by the participation of this holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municare, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim cantatur Antiphora quae de Communione nome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mutuauit. Eaae<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forma pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationis habetur in Canone Miſſae, inſerto Miſſali, ſecundum vſum Sarum.</note> retaine the geſture of kneeling, as it was in the old Maſſe of the Communion, and although the Papiſts doe abuſe kneeling in the Idolatrous adoration of the Sacrament, it was lawfully reſtored to the inuocation of God by Chriſt, in the receiuing of the Communion, euen as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his Apoſtles, and the Chriſtians in the primatiue Church did vſe, it is alſo manifeſt, as well by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the firſt <hi>Theſe,</hi> as by this, that neyther Prayer nor the Communion, nor any other religious Action was performed in ſitting after the manner of our Country. Wherefore they that refuſe to receiue the Communion, vnleſſe they receiue it ſitting, haue no warrant, neyther by the example of Chriſt, nor by his Apoſtles, nor by the Primatiue Church.</p>
