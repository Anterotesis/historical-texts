         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE,
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Think there needs not much
be said to recommend the
following Sheets to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Reader. It has been
the Opinion of the Wisest Men
that <hi>Letters, Memoirs,</hi> and <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Speeches,</hi> have ever been the
Clearest and Most Exact Histories
of Times, and have given the
truest Light into the <hi>Spirit</hi> and
<hi>Bent</hi> of a People, especially, where
<hi>Liberty,</hi> that Darling of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
that sweetest Cordial of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
bears Sway; and where shall
We find it so justly, Claim'd so
strenuously maintain'd as in our
<pb facs="tcp:95134:3"/>
               <hi>English Constitution?</hi> a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
so exactly sitted for
the Preserving that <hi>Inestimable
Jewel,</hi> that the Deepest Arts and
Subtilties of the most Crafty
Statesmen cou'd never yet <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
or <hi>Ravish</hi> our <hi>Envied
Freedom</hi> from us; on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
They have ever met their
own <hi>Destruction,</hi> when They have
been so Rash as to make the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
and I dare boldly say, that
We our selves must <hi>give</hi> it away, if
ever We are not Masters of it; for
it cannot be <hi>forc'd</hi> from us.</p>
            <p>If We reflect on the Hardships
other Nations Groan Vnder, and
then consider the Plenty and Ease
We sensibly Enjoy, We must justly
Honour the Memories of our Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Ancestors, who have handed
down <hi>so dear a Prize</hi> to us. If
we look backward, we shall find
<pb facs="tcp:95134:3"/>
there have been great Attempts,
both Open and Secret, to break in
upon, or lessen our just <hi>Rights</hi>
and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> but there have
ever been Persons of <hi>Generous
Spirits</hi> and <hi>Unshaken Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
Who have nobly Oppos'd the
bold Invaders, being neither to be
<hi>Aw'd</hi> nor <hi>Brow-beaten</hi> by any
<hi>Higher Power,</hi> nor <hi>Brib'd</hi> by
the most Advantageous offers of
<hi>Profit</hi> or <hi>Honour,</hi> to betray so
<hi>Glorious</hi> a <hi>Cause:</hi> We have
never yet found <hi>a Wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour</hi>
or an <hi>Evil Minister</hi> that
cou'd <hi>Escape</hi> the <hi>Justice</hi> of a
<hi>House of Commons.</hi> 'Tis true
in some former Reigns a <hi>Parliament</hi>
was no very desirable Thing, and
seldom call'd, but whenever they
met they bravely <hi>Attack'd</hi> the <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
of the <hi>Nation</hi> tho' never so
<hi>Potent,</hi> and <hi>brought down</hi> such
<pb facs="tcp:95134:4"/>
as have thought themselves <hi>Secure,</hi>
and <hi>Out of Reach;</hi> and I trust, as
we <hi>have not yet,</hi> we <hi>never shall,</hi>
see <hi>Ill Men</hi> in <hi>such a Station.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We live now (God be thanked)
in a time when we need not fear
<hi>Encroachments</hi> on our <hi>Just Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and Properties;</hi> are we
not Blest with a <hi>King</hi> who hath no
Design to <hi>Enslave</hi> or <hi>Burthen</hi> his
People? Have we not <hi>Ministers</hi>
that Act with <hi>Uprightness</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity?</hi>
Are we not rul'd by a
<hi>Monarch</hi> who makes the Interest
of the <hi>Nation his own,</hi> and regards
<hi>Merit only</hi> in the <hi>Choice</hi> of his
<hi>Ministers?</hi> do we see any <hi>Court-Minion</hi>
or <hi>haughty Favorite</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd?
or any Man of worth pass
<hi>Unregarded</hi> and <hi>Despis'd?</hi> In
short, have we not a <hi>King</hi> who only
thinks himself happy, because he sees
his People so? And as the common
<pb facs="tcp:95134:4"/>
Adage has it, <hi>Regis ad exemplum.</hi>
Do we not see our Grandees following
their Great Masters Steps? Are not
Envy and Ambition <hi>now</hi> Banish'd
the Palace Gates? What Courtiers
do we <hi>now</hi> find breaking their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
or giving only Words instead
of just Performances? Do they
<hi>now</hi> covet Perferments to get vast
Estates? Are they not contented
with their moderate Perquisites?
What Ministers can the most obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Eye find <hi>Guilty</hi> of <hi>Acting,</hi> or
<hi>Advising,</hi> Ill? Or who amongst them
are afraid to stand the Test of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
Scrutiny?</hi> Such is the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
we <hi>now</hi> Enjoy, such are the
Blessings of our <hi>Present</hi> Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
But I have wander'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my purpose, my Zeal to <hi>so
much Goodness</hi> has carry'd me
wide of my Design, which was to say
something by way of Preface of the
<pb facs="tcp:95134:5"/>
following Sheets, which were Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
not to reflect on the Memory
of any, but at the desire of some
very Iudicious Persons, who thought
it pitty a Collection so fill'd with
Law and solid Sense shou'd be kept
secret; and I believe none, who
read it, but will highly applaud
the Publishing. The World must
own that the Learned Persons, whose
Speeches are contain'd in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Pages, have been famous
for the depth of their Iudgment,
and profoundness of their Sense, and
many of them have been justly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
the most eminent Lawyers of
their Time: I shall only add that
several of our greatest Men have
highly valued it in Manuscript, and
I doubt not but all who read it, will
think it fit, not only for a Lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's,
but every <hi>English</hi> Gentleman's
Study.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ed. Seym. Charged him <hi>viva
voce</hi> with many great Crimes,
whereupon a Debate arose what
Proceeding ought to be had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, some moving to Impeach him in the
Name of the <hi>Commons</hi> till Articles should
be prepared, others urg'd, that Witnesses
should be first examined to see how the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95134:6"/>
Charge could be made good, least failing,
it should reflect on the Honour of the <hi>House;</hi>
after long Debate, a Committee was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to search Records for Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Proceedings in the like Cases, and to
make Report.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>30th,</hi> The Report being made by Sir <hi>Tho.
Litt.</hi> that various Proceedings were found
in several Parliaments, it occasioned a long
Debate, several Members speaking to the
effect following,</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Tho. Litt.</speaker>
                  <p>That in Cases Criminal,
they find Proceedings to have been, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by Articles, sometimes by word of
Mouth; but in Capital Crimes no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
appear till the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s
Case, against whom the <hi>House</hi> carried up
a general Impeachment, the Reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
seems to be this: Some Votes were
made in the <hi>House</hi> at which the King takes
Offence, as if they would proceed upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fame; whereupon they vindicate their
Proceedings as done in a Parliamentary way,
and appoint a Committee to withdraw for
about half an Hour to consider the Matter
for a Conference with the Lords about the
Charge, and upon their Report a general
Charge is carryed up to the Lords Bar; the
principal Charge then was for advising to
bring over the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, and the single
Proof was Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> so the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
went up for <hi>High-Treason,</hi> tho' no
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95134:6"/>
Member would positively say he would
make the Charge good.</p>
                  <p>So for the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> there
was no Impeachment, but a Charge in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>And if you take not the same Course
now, but insist upon examining Witnesses
first, the Difficulties will be unanswerable;
for is it like that Men before they shall see
you in earnest will have their Names pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
against the Earl of <hi>Clarendon?</hi> If this
be your proceeding, we must never expect
to Impeach a great Man more. If you
think there is nothing in the Charge leave
it, but if you think 'tis worth your while
take heed of making such a dangerous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
as by neglecting it to wound your
Liberties; but proceed in the usual way
with a general Impeachment.</p>

business of <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Canterbury;</hi> I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that business from the beginning:
Sir, <hi>Iohn Clotworthy</hi> informed something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

he had assumed an Arbitrary Power in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and dispossessed one <hi>Savage</hi> by force
of Arms, and undertook to prove it. Sir
<hi>Henry Vane</hi> also told them that he had a
Note taken out of his Fathers Cabinet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Advice which <hi>Strafford</hi> gave the
<hi>King</hi> in that Case. Namely, the <hi>King</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95134:7"/>
Money, and the Question being how
he should supply it, he replyed, <hi>That if the
Parliament was refractory and would not, you
stand loosed and absolved from Rules of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
you have an Army in</hi> Ireland <hi>which you
may employ to reduce them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then there was a Debate whether they
should accuse him of Treason. And Sir
<hi>Edward Herbert</hi> (the Attorney) said, if
you are perswaded the Truth is, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
you may, and so it was; but when
the close Committee had examined the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
they moved the <hi>House,</hi> that some
Lawyers might be added to them, and had
they gone, when they said they were ready,
they had not touched one Hair of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s
Head. Then it was considered what was
fit to be done: To accuse him of <hi>Treason</hi>
would be a dangerous President, as if out
of many other Crimes a <hi>Treason</hi> could be
drawn, thereupon it was <hi>Resolved</hi> not to
demand Judgment from the Lords, because
some Articles were not <hi>Treason.</hi> Then it
was propounded not to State what his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
were, lest it should give advantage
to inferior Courts so to proceed; but said
he deserved to be accused of <hi>Treason,</hi> and
in conclusion a Proviso was added, not to
make that Case a President.</p>
                  <p>For the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
were general, and he was long in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
without any proceeding against him;
but after long time he demurr'd, then new
Articles were framed, on which he dyed.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Iohn Vaugh.</speaker>
                  <p>You have had a Charge
opened of a strange Nature, and I know
not what part of it can be proved, but the
reputation of <hi>This House</hi> is at Stake, and of
<hi>the King</hi> too; For, where a Charge is
brought in by some of your Members,
whereof one Article is, That he should say
such words, of the King, as by a Statue made
by you is a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> and to give Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
to levy War upon the Kingdom; is it
agreeable to our Duty to the King and
Kingdom to let it die?</p>
                  <p>For the Person concerned, I know not
which way his Honour can be whole with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his giving an Answer to his Charge;
for Mark the Consequence, if the King
should take him to favour again before
clear'd, will not the World say a Person is
received to favour again, who gave the
King Councel against the Kingdom, and
traduc'd the King, and how can he be whole
in his Honour this way;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But it will be said, we must have
ground to put him to Answer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Whether you have ground enough
to prove I know not, but you have ground
enough to make him Answer to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Suppose those two Articles had been
Charged on a Member of this <hi>House,</hi> what
would it have become that Member to do;
Should he sit still and say, I will make no
Answer, but see whether the <hi>House</hi> will
make more proof; If he should do so, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95134:8"/>
not making an Answer is Reason enough to
Charge him.</p>
                  <p>I can give you Instances of Persons charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Parliament, who, tho' not nominated,
yet being (as it were) pointed at, Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
that they might Answer, and so would
any Man; but when this is bruited up and
down, will not the World say? You never
ask the party whether Guilty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Duke of Suffolk</hi> was Charged upon
Common Fame, and if that were a ground
for a Charge then (which I do not say it
was) so it is in this Case; but he moved
that he might be heard, and tho' it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
he might be Committed, yet it was
justly rejectly till he had Answered: Then
for the Nature of the Charge, if it be true,
it is very High, but whether it be Treason
is another Matter, it is brought to you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no Name, when you make the Charge,
it becomes you to say what it is; therefore
Choose a Committee to reduce the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into Heads, and bring them to you,
without which you cannot right you selves,
nor him, if Innocent.</p>
                  <p>For the way of it, it cannot be thought
fit to publish your Witnesses and the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before-hand; if in private Causes the
Defendant and Plaintiff should have a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
before hand, no Cause would be
rightly Judged, much less when you have
Publication of all which concerns the One,
but nothing of the Other. Again, if a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95134:8"/>
Witness be examined concerning Matters
in his own Knowledg, if he gives Evidence,
where he is not brought judicially to give it,
if he hath testified any Thing which brings
him within the Statute of false News,
how can he avoid the Penalty? For its not
enough for him to say he knows it but he
must have others to justifie it.</p>
                  <p>As for the Persons who bring the Charge,
they are your own Members, which the
Writs return for honest and discreet Men,
and if you are satisfied of that, how can
you reject their Complaint, tho' ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon <hi>Common Fame,</hi> as all Accusations
are, seeing they tell you, they can bring-Proof
of what they say?</p>
                  <p>Then for <hi>Common Fame,</hi> if a Man spends
largely, and hath no visible way to get an
Estate, no Man accuseth him to have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it unlawfully; yet he may be put to
clear himself from what <hi>Common Fame</hi>
chargeth him with. Upon suspicion of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
I may bring a Man before a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to clear himself, so in the Course of
<hi>Indictments,</hi> and <hi>Presentments,</hi> a Charge is
given of what Things are to be Presented?
then a Proclamation is made, That if any
one can give Evidence, he may be Sworn,
but if no Evidence appear, yet they may
Indict.</p>
                  <p>Then it will be said, the Oath is a Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Thing, but we are proceeding without
an Oath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95134:9"/>
To this I Answer, What this <hi>House</hi> shall
Charge is of more Authority than the
Oaths of ordinary Witnesses; <hi>Peers</hi> tho' not
upon Oath are supposed to do right, so are
we upon the Reputation of our Honesty
and Discretion.</p>

                  <p>An Impeachment there
must be, if there be Cause; such Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not to be passed over in silence.</p>
                  <p>I believe not one truth in the Law more
than this Proposition, That there is no
such thing as Treason by Common-Law, or
by Equity, and we hold our Lives by that
Law; before the 25th of <hi>Ed.</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> a
Man could scarce speak any think but it
was <hi>Treason</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> or <hi>out,</hi> but no
Man ought to die as a Traitor, who hath
not literally offended that Law, or some
other made since: There is indeed in that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95134:9"/>
Law a Proviso about the Parliaments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
what is Treason, but note the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of taking declaratory Powers, which I
fear hath brought us into a Reckoning of
Blood, which we have not yet paid for.</p>
                  <p>The Power of Parliaments is double,
<hi>Legislative,</hi> which hath no bounds, <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi>
by pronouncing Judgments.</p>
                  <p>And tho' I know not what the <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
Power of a Parliament cannot do, yet
it is not in the power of the Parliament,
King, Lords, nor Commons, to declare any
thing to be Treason which is not in the
Common-Law Felony before. The Proviso
in <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Case was (it's true) made
for Inferior Courts; but I hope we shall not
so proceed as must needs draw after it a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahatur
in Exemplum,</hi> and your own Act
this Parliament shews, That all done by
<hi>Strafford, a-part,</hi> or <hi>together,</hi> was not <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi>
And it behoves us to take heed we
thwart not our own Argument.</p>
                  <p>For the manner then, Consider how you
should proceed if it were out of Parliament,
and how the bringing of it into the <hi>House</hi>
alters it.</p>
                  <p>If it were out of Parliament, without
doubt the Accusation should be proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand, and those who discover it are
guilty of Felony. This provides for the
Subject, that the Witnesses must be Two,
and for the King, that none shall discover
the Evidence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:95134:10"/>
But suppose the Charge be for Misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours,
the Tryal then is not to be by
the Lords, but by the Commons; for the
Lords are his Peers only in Cases Capital.
How then doth the bringing it in to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
alter the Case? If the Parliament
set aside Laws in this Case, we should be
happy to see Law declaring what is the
power of Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>There is no President produced which
is singly of Weight to guide you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you proceed, let it be as near as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
by the good Old Laws; Namely, That
there be an Accusation founded upon an
Oath and the Evidence kept secret, I
propose that way for the very reason that
others oppose it (<hi>viz</hi>). The Accusation
goes over the Kingdom, and it will bring
dishonour to the <hi>House,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and the
<hi>Earl;</hi> For the Honour of the <hi>House,</hi> it will
be hard to say, the Charge was brought in
upon misinformation; a Person accused
for advising to bring in Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for saying the King is not
fit to Govern; If this be true, tho' it be
not Treason in the formality of the Law, it
deserves no less Punishment then if it were;
but if not found Guilty, Consider the Case.
If one say, <hi>A</hi> killed a Man and it is not
so, must not he give reparation? We have
an accusation upon hear-say, but if it be
not made good, the blackest Scandal which
Hell can invent, lies at our door.</p>

the Earl of <hi>Middlesex</hi> (<hi>Cranfield</hi>'s Case)

Bribery, which might be proved by their
own Books, but this is for Scandalizing the

                  <p>But suppose they be of the Lords <hi>House,</hi>
Can you send for them? Or if you do, will
they come and say it? The matter of this
Accusation is such, that if it lies in the
knowledge of a single Person, if he delivers
it extrajudicially (which he doth, if not
upon Oath) he may be undone by it, and
hazard his Person too: At the Committee of
Grievances the Persons must be known, and
what they can say, and then we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

The Clerk having read them a second time

                  <p>You admit the Accusation to
be matter for a Charge, if the Committee
find proof; if you intend to make this a

ordering a way of Proceeding in the Earl
of <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s Case, which shall not be a
general Rule. Tho' I cannot say one of the
Articles to be true, yet I know them to be
a full Charge if made good, and you are
prescribing a Course neither proper, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
practised. A Witness who speaks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Outh is subject to Damage; not so up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>If the Pardon be general, the
Judges and you are to Note it, but if it
hath Qualifications (as that Act hath) they
are not to Note it; for you must say there
is no Indictment or Outlawry against him

is to stand.</p>

                  <p>The Clause for Pardon is Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
and any Man accused, pleading it
shall not be Sued, nor his Fault mentioned,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95134:17"/>
and this is to Offences and Offenders;
and for those who betrayed the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

                  <p>When I am satisfied of a thing
I am not ashamed to own it; I find now,
having perused the Act, that it is within
the Clause. The Indempnity is general,
and he is within it if not excepted, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
reaches those who have held Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

                  <p>The Crime seems as great
as a Chancellor could commit; the King
was to present by such a day, or not at all,
the Error was found after the day, so that
the King (by Act of Parliament) had lost
his right. The Chancellor did alter the
Patent, and the Record was fetch'd away
by one of the Chancellor's Servants, and
brought back rased, and altered, which
might be done (and in other Cases is done)
where a word only hath been mistaken; but
that is in Case of something perfectly in the
King's Power, and to save new sealing; but
here could be no new sealing the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
elapsed: It was to throw another Man
out of his Freehold, and is a great Crime.</p>

One, whether what's Charged in the
Article was Treason in Common-Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. That so we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the nature of Treason; The other,
Whether by any subsequent Act it is made
otherwise.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Wall.</speaker>
                  <p>The Advice given to the King
I look upon to be this. To establish a New
Government, To be Govern'd by <hi>Ianizaries</hi>
instead of a Parliament, To have a <hi>Divan</hi>
and a great Minister of State, a <hi>Vizier-Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau,</hi>
a worse Plot than that of the 5th of
<hi>November;</hi> There, if the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
had been destroyed, there would have
been Succession, but here both had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
for ever. Then in order to the
Debate, consider how the Law looks on it;
for tho' we may accuse on less Evidence
than she may Judge, yet we must be Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
in naming the Crime: What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth the Law call this before 25 <hi>Ed. 3?</hi>
Then look whether the power of Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Treason be taken away since.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Fra. Goodr.</speaker>
                  <p>The matter concerns Life,
therefore we should be wary in the Exercise
of Legislative Power; you are not tyed to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95134:20"/>
Rules, but you are now a step towards Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature;
The Common-Law is <hi>Ius non
Scriptum,</hi> and tho' every Treason includes
Felony, yet not every Felony Treason. 25
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3. There is a Declaratory Power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a thing be Treason, or other Felony,
not whether it be Treason, and could not
be declared Treason if not Felony before.
In Cases Capital at Common-Law they
might declare it Treason, but in Cases not
Capital at Common-Law, they never exer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cised
their Declaratory Power.</p>
                  <p>Among other things that Statute declares
false Coin'd Money to be Treason, which is
but Felony at Common-Law; afterwards
Money being imported, which was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Stamp, there was no Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for it, but as a Misdemeanour: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
4. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. Provision is made against that
Practice, and it is made Treason, but if the
Parliaments Declaratory-Power could have
Made it Treason, what needed a Statute on
purpose? So that I cannot think the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
before you is Treason, it not coming
within the words of the Statute.</p>

                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Vaugh.</speaker>
                  <p>I shall speak to the first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
whether this Article was Treason at
Common-Law; and first remove what some
have asserted, Namely, That nothing is
Treason but what was Felony before. 25
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3. where petty Treason is spoken of,
the Wife killing the Husband' <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95134:21"/>
words follow, If hereafter it come into Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether there be another Treason, it
shall not be resolved by the Judges, till the
Parliament determine it; For in petty
Treason, if it be Treason, it must be Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
because there is killing.</p>
                  <p>Then comes more, whether raising, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and it follows whether it be Felony or Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass;
And the thing it self is more strange.
None ever doubted, but that all Treasons
of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. was Treason before, and was
so resolved 12 Q <hi>Eliz.</hi> That by that Act
the King declares what should be Treason;
Namely, If any Man Vitiates the King's El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Daughter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But by this Doctrine if
it were not Treason, what was it? Either
Adultry or Fornication, when it is only the
Eldest Daughter, not the Youngest.</p>
                  <p>It hath been in all Ages a Reputation to
Persons who have been Councellors to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
according to Emergencies to give Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to extricate out of danger. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hard to tax a Minister of State in a
Case which he acquaints his Master with;
for there can be no Treason but against the
King himself.</p>
                  <p>I will shew you what I mean. It is true this
is a Treason which cannot arise from Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prision,
because it was spoke to the King
himself; but as a Minister of State he has
liberty to give Councel for the King's safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
If a Person be able to Inform his Master
what Alliances are good for him, it his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95134:21"/>
so what Trades are profitable, what
not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So where Men or Money are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to advise how to extricate is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable;
but when it comes to this, that he
breaks in upon the Laws, invading the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
between the King and his Subjects, it
will be as if a Man adviseth, That if the
King wants Money, he may set up High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Men to take it, and bring it to him,
and so the skilfullest for breaking the Law
shall be esteemed the best Councellor; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
whoever thinks to serve his Prince by
breaking the Laws, he is so far from a
wise Man, that he is the highest Criminal.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> then for the Nature of the thing, the
Treasons declared 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. were declared
by the King's Commission, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were of that Nature which concern'd
Councel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were not like to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
and there is a passage in <hi>Glanvil,</hi>
called <hi>Seductio Domini Regis,</hi> that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the King to what is pernicious to
Him, and his People.</p>
                  <p>Now see the Nature of this Crime; if a
Man Councel his Prince, and practice it such
a way as shall render him Prince of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
who hath broken his Oath, and all
this to his Injury, so that he hath no Assent
to it. Compare this with any Treason of
25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. consider it: Here is a person who
gives the King Advice, which at once must
make his People see he hath broken all his
Faith to his Kingdom (and is not the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95134:22"/>
of Governing by an Army such?) all the
Laws broken, to keep which the King has
Sworn, and this the King put upon tho' not
inclin'd to, I assert not this upon the Earl
of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> but upon the Article, who
doth this, Councels the highest Treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Common-Law, because others
are so; but if a Man will pretend to give
Councel, wherein many shall have no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by the Law, he breaks all parts, and
therefore I think this Councel was Treason
at Common-Law.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Colem.</speaker>
                  <p>The Question is, Whether it
be in your Power to declare this Article
Treason by 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. If he advised an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
against the King's consent, it is against
the Statute; but I suppose that the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in the Article was Advice to the King
in Aid of his Government. Your Enacting
Power is a kind of Omnipotency, but in a
Declaratory Power you can declare no
more than is committed to you, and with
safety to the Subject you cannot declare this
Treason; Then what must be our Rule in
Declaring I dare not say: For Scarce any
Man can tell what was Treason before 25
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3. was made to bring things to a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and what was uncertain to them
who made that Law can be certain to us
now. As the Judges can declare no other
Treason, so in your Declaratory Power
neither can you declare Treason unless
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95134:22"/>
there be Resemblance to some other like
Case: The Advice said in the Article to be
given the King, cannot be within that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
unless the Councellour must run the
hazard of his Advice.</p>

when made so. Some think not, because
they find not the Parliament declaring
them Treasons, as being so at Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Law,
and that that Statute was made to
bound them, but that was only to bound
Inferior Courts, not themselves; for the
Parliament makes not a new Crime and
then Condemns it, but the Crime was
before, and the Parliament declares it.</p>

That may be made Treason which is not,
and this which is a great Crime, ought not
because great, to be made Treason.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be said, levying War
against the Law, is against the King, and
here was an intent to alter the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> True, yet a design no levy War
is not Treason within the Statute, here is
nothing of Act, but Words to that end; If
a Councellor gives bad Advice, it makes it
not Treason, but by a Bill it may be made
what you please. By that Statute of 25
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3. are more Treasons than are metni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned;
for it faith if any Case happen, the
Judges shall stay till the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath declared, so that there is a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but the <hi>Modus</hi> is the Question, whether
by Impeachment, or Bill; you may the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
not the former. It, was done, but you
have Repealed it, and have said <hi>None of
which pretended Crimes are
Treason;</hi> and what was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
against him?<note n="*" place="margin">Of Strafford.</note> That he had Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torously
Endeavoured (which is worse than
design'd) to alter the Government, &amp;c.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95134:24"/>
Now where is the Difference? Here is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to Raise an Army, there to use an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Raised, and these you have called pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Crimes, and no Treason, which is not
Comprechended by a Law; but to Impeach
as a Treason, and yet the thing No Treason
is strange. In this <hi>House,</hi> other then by
Bill, you have no Power; you carry your
Impeachment to the Lords, and they may
give Judgment without coming back to
you; declaring by Bill is by way of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but as an Impeachment, is only an
Accusation: So that whatsoever the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is, the Lords judge it, and it never
comes back to you, and if you go by Bill
you make it Treason, <hi>ex post sacto.</hi>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Vang.</speaker>
                  <p>Concerning what you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
about <hi>Straffords,</hi> that this Case is, if
not less, equal to it, and you have declared
that not one Charge aganst him is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is true thus far, when that Act was
made I repaired to it, because there were
some Things which should not have passed
so, if there had not been something to
secure such Charges as these; for there is
no expression of any Particular Charge, but
that the Charge against the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>
was not in the particular, Treason, and in
the Ciose of the Bill, it is said, that the whole
Proceeding shall be taken away, and if so,
no Man should speak against the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
but look on it as Repealed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95134:24"/>
Then this is said to be levying War, and
its true, it must be Actual, and so not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Charge. And the Charge against
<hi>Spencer</hi> was for Councelling the King, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
and is called levying War against the
Kingdom, and the Judgment against him
was but Banishment; because the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was mitigated at the instance of the
King.</p>
                  <p>And for Councel, tho' Councel is given
but in Words, yet Words are more than
Councel, and are an Action, otherwise a
Councellour is Sworn to nothing.</p>
                  <p>But it may be thought I have not dealt
ingenuously with the <hi>House,</hi> than which I
abhor nothing more; when the Case of
<hi>Strafford</hi> was before the Lords, I was of
opinion the Parliament had no Declarative
Power left, because 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. there was an
abolishing of all declared Treason, and
that no Treason, for the future, should be so,
and then the Treason about the <hi>Genoua</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
was gone, and all declared Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were gone 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. and no Statute
hath recovered them, and if all Actual
Treasons were taken away 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. or if
not then, 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. then what doth the first
of Q. M. do, unless it take away all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory
Treason?</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:95134:25"/>
Upon the whole, the Question was
whether to accuse of Treason upon the first
Article.

                  <p>This is an Article of an high
Nature, <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was then as much a Part
of His Majesty's Dominions as <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
if the Sale of it be nothing, I know not
what you would think of it if <hi>England</hi>
should be Sold, you lately debated whether
on the first Article he should be accused of
Treason, and found by the Statute of 25
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3. he could not, tho' it was absolute
Treason at Common-Law, and its reported
abroad that I said that the Right of the
Parliament in declaring Treason is taken
away, which I did not, for there are Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
not mentioned in that Statute. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it provided that the Judges should not
upon any one Treaso proceed to Judge,
untill declared before the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and what is signisfied by it? If we
think before the King, Lords, and Commons,
that is impossible, for how can the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
possibly declare before the King and
Lords, nor was that the Case, but this, that
<hi>there</hi> is the ultimate Power of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what the Law is in a doubtful Case.
In Writs of Error let them pass from Court
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95134:26"/>
to Court, at last they come to the Lords,
24 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. If the Judges cannot resolve what
the Law is, it is to be brought thither,
that is, where it is questionable, but that is
not in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> any more than
in a Writ of Error: How than is the Case
here? If a Question be whether a Thing is
Treason, or not, it shall be Resolved where
the Law useth to Resolve, that is, before the
King in Parliament, that is in the Lords
<hi>House.</hi> Had the Words of the Act been
these, there shall be no Proceeding untill
Resolved by the King in the Lords <hi>House,</hi>
and Suppose that Clause taken away, That
Treason shall not be Resolved, but suppose
it shall not be declared otherwise, doth it
follow it is taken away? No, if you charge
Treason which is not within the Statute,
it is another Thing, but I said not, there is
no Treason at Common-Law.</p>

                  <p>There was a great Mischief
in the declaring Treason by Parliaments;
for <hi>Mortimer</hi> was made a Traitor for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching
upon Royal Power, which every
Man, who incroacheth upon any Power,
doth. Hence the <hi>Commons</hi> Petition'd the
King to explain what incroaching upon
Royal Power was, and when no Answer
could be gotten to it, 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. They Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
it might be declared certainly, and
so Treasons were enumerated, and if the
Judges be in doubt, it is <hi>Provided</hi> &amp; that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95134:27"/>
the King and Parliament shall first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it.</p>
                  <p>Declaration in Parliament, is a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before the King, Lords, and Commons.
Would our Ancestors leave what is to be
Resolved Treason to the Lords, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have no share in it? And <hi>Talbots</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
declared Treason by the Lords is said
to be no Treason by Judge <hi>Cook,</hi> because
the <hi>Commons</hi> had no hand in it, there is no
Treason in Common-Law, because there
can be no Treason where there is no way
to Judge it, which is not at Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Law.</p>

                  <p>Either you can justifie your

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Sollicitor,</speaker>
                  <p>Without doubt this House
was not mistaken in demanding that the
Party accused for Treason should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
That is, that Treason is worthy of
Commitment; and you can but find Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
that Persons have been accused of
Treason, and thereupon have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
But the Case is this, Treason is an
Offence, for which Bail cannot be taken;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95134:31"/>
the Lords tell you not they will, or will not
Commit: But it is true, Persons have been
Committed for Treason, and Persons accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Treason Judges may Commit, or
not.</p>
                  <p>Consider this Law. Let the Crime be
what it will, an Imprisoning till the Charge
it given is but an Imprisoning to security,
not to Punishment; otherwise the Law is
not Just, and if the Judges of the <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bench</hi>
have a Judgment of Discretion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Commit or not; can we wonder
that the Lords have not Imprisoned, till
they know the Article, when they have
Judgments of Discretion tho' they knew it?
You may find Presidents, but it is not an
Argument it must always be so: But as the
Judges have a Latitude much more then the
Lords, the Impeachment from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of <hi>England</hi> is properly the King's Suit,
for there is no Treason but against him, and
if the Judges may Bail in that Case, may
not the Lords. But you are not told he
shall be Balied, but they desire to know
what his Crime is, and then you shall know
their Answer, the Resolution seems rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
having gone no farther, I cannot
except against it.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p> The Lords do not
say Commitments should follow because
Treason is Bailable by the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> its
true, the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Bails for Treason,
but how? If Persons be brought thither
for Treason directly there is no Bail, but
when a Commitment is by the Councel Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for suspition of Treason, then if the
Matter fall not be to what was expected
they give notice to take Bail, else the great
Article of the Great Charter, Mamely that
Justice should not be delay'd nor denied,
would be to no purpose; and in such a
Case a Man may be in Prison for ever. On
the other side, what is the Case of Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for Treason? when a Person is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the Councel-Table, they say,
thay do no more but by special Command
of the King, and that is the ground of his
Committing, and were not this so, what
would follow? Intelligence would be given
of a Treason discovered, wherein many
might be concerned, and if they who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
should Commit with the Treason, all
the Complices would escape, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sometime they make it Treason Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
Then for the Case, before you have
gone up with a Charge of Treason general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which is to the Lords a Warrant suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for Commitment, say they, we will know
the Particulars; then will not the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
follow, if other Persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned,
and so the danger of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon the nicety?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:95134:32"/>
If a Business comes before this House,
which concerns others, and may prove
Treason, if we go to the Lords (for we
have not Jurisdiction except in Case of our
Priviledges) but yet are not ready to bring
up Particulars, and desire the Lords to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
such Persons, would it be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them to refuse it, there being no
inconvenience like to follow the doing it,
much the not doing it? I say not to Commit
them, and we not prosecute, for that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
of Justice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> But why do the Lords refuse?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Tho' I have great respect to the
Lords, yet to clear something in point of
Priviledge, the Lords have the same Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
with us in point of Speech, their
Members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they are essential to pass
Laws; but that great Priviledge which they
often assumo as Peers, is as the King is
there present in the highest Court: How
then will it fall out in respect of this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge?
If the King be there, there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Things which the Lords as Peers cannot
pretend to; for the King hath often sate
there not only in passing Bills, but in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Had this Charge then come before
the King there, it had been reason if the
King should have said, <hi>I desire to know
what this Treason is,</hi> we must then have
told it, because he, whom it concerned,
required it, or if we desire Commitment,
he, who could Release or Pardon him, might
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95134:32"/>
say, <hi>let him be Bailed.</hi> The Lords indeed
retain this Priviledge, but it is in the
King's Right, not as Peers.</p>
                  <p>Now we have carryed a Charge, if the
Lords Bail him, I know not what would
follow, for no Example can be given of it,
and I think they will not do it, if the King
do not direct it.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, I would be glad we
might be no more troubled than is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
because others are listening what we do,
and think there is nothing in the Case:
Therefore I am not for delay, but satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others that what we have done is not
barely for Imprisoning the Earl of <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
but for Justice; and if you go this way,
give the Lords the Reasons why we sent
the Charge as we did, and yet keep up their
Priviledges, and declare so to them.</p>
                  <p>But than we must go up with more than
that Head, on which we Resolved to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
of Treason; for your Articles must
be so formed as to make it a Charge sit to
be Answer'd for Time and Place, and that
Article hath something of that which must
be penned so as to make it more certain;
for the Article goes but thus; <hi>That there
was Discovery and Betraying of the King's
Councels to his Enemies,</hi> and if you leave it
there, those who scruple doing any Thing
because particular Treason is not mentioned,
will say, <hi>you say he hath discovered and
betrayed Councels to Enemies, but as we
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95134:33"/>
trust you not what is Treason, but we will
know it; so we know not whom you mean
by Enemies; for we may think them not so.</hi>
Therefore appoint a Committee to form
Articles.</p>

                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Solicit.</speaker>
                  <p>It is a great mistake to say,
That the Power of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> to take
Bail for Treason is no other but what is
asserted, as if the Judges there had only
Power from <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> When a Man is
Committed upon suspition of Treason, and
no Prosecution follows, and the Party
bringing his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> the <hi>Bench</hi> Bails
him because he should not lie there eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
it is not to be said the Judges Bail
for Treasons, seeing no Crime is produced:
For when a Man hath been accused of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for Coining false Money and brought to
the Bar, the Judges have Bailed him not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they ought, but from the discretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Power wherewith the Law trusts
them; they may Bail if they will, for no
other Judicature, but they, can Bail in that
Case: for seeing Imprisonment before Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
is only that the Prisoner may be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming,
if they see there is no danger of
escaping they may take Bail, for he is a
Prisoner when Bailed, and the Bail is his
Keeper; but there are few Cases of this
Kind wherein they will Bail; they have a
fundamental Power to do it, placed
in them to preserve the Rights of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95134:33"/>
Crown, and the Lords will not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
less trusted with the Rights of the
Crown then the <hi>Kings-Bench.</hi> Yet tho' the
Lords may Bail, they will not exercise their
discretion when there is a probable Truth
in the Impeachment; shall we then refuse
this Intimation from the Lords? Who say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because they have not a particular Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Treason do not secure, seem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that if they had they would, tho' they
might refuse. The Right of Bailing comes
not from an imaginary apprehension of the
King's sitting there, tho some Kings have
sate there in Judicature, but from their
Inherent Authority of being trusted with
the Right of the Crown: Let us do then
what becomes us, and not let the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
miscarry upon a misunderstanding but
draw up the Article. But how is it possible
to draw it as an Article which you expect
he should be imprisoned upon? For your
Impeachment is in the Nature of an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and must contain so much of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
as to put him to plead, that so he
may not Demur.</p>
                  <p>How may it then be Circumstantiated, so
as that he may put to plead? if you do
it according to 25 Ed, 3. (for discovering
the Thing's Secrets to his Enemies is within
that Statute.) The first part of the Article
is not pleadable; for we must shew how he
adhered to the King's Enemies, and wemust
add what the Councel was that he betrayed,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95134:34"/>
else he will deny to plead, and say, I can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
it: Therefore consider what kind of
certainty this Article must have to make
him plead, for the other Articles, its enough
to say them without proving Time or
Place, if the Facts were after the Act of <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion;</hi>
but in Treason, the Matter must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the Indictment, for he hath liberty
not only to plead not Guilty, but to avoid
it: Therefore prepare the Article accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>

               <p>The Committee brought in their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:95134:35"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> What can or ought to be done by
either <hi>House</hi> of Parliament is best known
by the Customes and Proceeding of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
in former times; And it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by Example, that by the Course of
Parliaments the Lords have Committed
such Persons, as have been generally Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the <hi>House Commons</hi> for High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to safe Custody, tho' the particular
Treason hath not been specified at the time
of such Charge</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> That a Commitment for High
Treason in general, is a Legal Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and if the Party so Committed bring
his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and the Cause of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
thereupon be returned for High
Treason generally, he may lawfully be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to prison by the Judges upon that
Return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third.</hi> If before securing the Person the
special matter of the Treason should be Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
it would be a ready course that
all Complices in the Treason might make
their Escape, or quicken the execution of
the Treason intended, to secure themselves
the better there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth.</hi> If the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Peers</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the particular Treason to be Assigned
before the Party Charged be secured, they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95134:35"/>
leave the Common uncertain and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
(and that from time to time) how par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
they must make their Charge to their
Lordships satisfaction, before the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
be put under any restraint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth,</hi> The Commons conceive, that if
they should desire the Lords to secure a
Stranger, or Native Commoner, upon su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition
of Treason which the Commons
had of him, and which was by them under
Examination to be Evidenced to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in due time; their Lordships in Justice
for the safety of the king and People would
secure such Person or Persons, upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of the Commons, and in such Case there
would be no difference between a Lord and
a Commoner so desired to be secured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixth,</hi> The Proceedings of inferior
Courts, between the King and the Subject,
or Subject and Subject, and the discretion
of Judges in such Courts is bounded and
limited by the discretion of the Parliament
which trust them; and 'tis not left to the
discretion of the Judges in ordinary Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to give the King, or take from him,
inconvenient Power for the Subject, nor to
dispence the Law partially between Subject
and Subject for Malice or Affection; but the
discretion of the Parliament, which is the
whole Publick, comprehending the King,
Lords and Commons (for the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95134:36"/>
is supposed to be in the Lords <hi>House</hi>)
is, and ought to be unconsin'd for the safety
and preservation of the whole, which is it
self.</p>
               <p>It cannot be malicious to a part of it
self, nor affect more Power than already it
hath, which is absolute over it self and part,
and may therefore do for preservation of it
self whatsoever is not repugnant to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Justice.</p>

it cannot be called a Custom where

                  <p>The great strength lies upon
this first Reason, and is like to be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident;
for exact Presidents I find none, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that of <hi>Michael Delapool,</hi> and in the
Long Parliament: But consider the reason
why there was no express President before,
and what was the Custom of Parliaments
before. The Parliament was wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
formerly by Bill, and thus that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
makes against the Lords now, and
for committing the Party accused; for then
the proceedings upon Treason were by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law,
and because the Judges could not
proceed, therefore the Paliment went by
Bill, and it cannot be supposed that the
Parties were at liberty all that while.</p>

                  <p>I am against this Reason,

the former Reasons satisfie not, this will
not, because it supposeth things not in
question.</p>
                  <p>Our Debate must at last end in this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
betwixt Priviledge of Parliament and
former proceedings; and there being no
priviledge in Case of Treason, why should
not former proceedings Sway? Except we
call that Treason which is not, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
no Priviledge will help.</p>
                  <p>Therefore add this to your Reason, That
there is no priviledge for Treason, and the
Lords ought not to think that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
will call that Treason which is not,
or if they do, the Lords may by a speedy
Trial determine it.</p>

                  <p>Made Report of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with the Lords yesterday to the
purpose following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lords told us,</hi> That no President can
be against the Law.</p>
                  <p>We Answer'd.</p>
                  <p>If that can be made good, we shall press
Presidents no more, but what they most
stood upon was the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> where
'tis <hi>provided</hi> that none shall be Committed
without special Cause, whereby the Party
may Answer according to the Law, thence
they infer that our Proceedings are against
Law; because a general Charge is against
the <hi>Petition of Right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commons.</hi> The Case of the <hi>Petition of
Right,</hi> rightly Stated, will clear this, which
was This: Some Persons were Committed
by no other Warrant, but the King's speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Command, they bring their <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>
to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> to know the Cause:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95134:39"/>
This Cause was returned by the Judges,
that they could not Bail a Man, when so
Committed, because they knew not the
Cause, nor had any way to bring him to
his Tryal.</p>
                  <p>Then the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> provides That
the Cause should be returned, whereby
the Crime might appear, and that before
and after the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> to this Day,
if upon bringing a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
that the Party is Imprisoned for
Treason, the Judges ought to Remand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
there be some special Cause to make
them take Bail. So that the <hi>Petition of Right</hi>
was against them, for they say, a Man
ought not to be Imprisoned upon a general
Charge, because 'tis against the <hi>Petition of
Right:</hi> We say it is not against the <hi>Petition
of Right,</hi> because the Judge may Remand
the Party, if there be no special Cause.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then the Lords said,</hi> That the Reason why
the Iudges Remanded in that Case was, because
the Party Committed knew it was for Treason
Therefore they Re-committed.</p>
                  <p>We owned it, because it was the Rule for
the Judges to proceed by, but that was
no Rule for Proceedings of Parliament, for
as a Magistrate Commits for Treason, and
is supposed to be acquainted with it; so
also is he with the probability upon the
Proof: But the Lords insist not now upon
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95134:39"/>
that, but specifie Treason, and if the
Course of Parliaments so much varied in
such Cases, that was no concluding Proof
why they should have special Treason.
And for the other part,</p>
                  <p>That upon the Return, there should be a
Cause Returned, that so the Party might
Answer; for when a Return is made, if
the Cause be such as that the Party ought
not to be Imprisoned, the Judges free him,
otherwise they leave him to come to his
Tryal.</p>
                  <p>Then to the President about the Earl of
<hi>Strafford,</hi> they <hi>Replyed,</hi> That it was made
in bad times. And we <hi>Answered,</hi> That as
good Laws were made before, in, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that time as any other; and if the Lords
then might make such Laws, we could
not see, why it should be a good time to
make Laws, and no good time to Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to Persons the Laws already made.</p>
                  <p>Farther, to their <hi>Objection,</hi> that in the
time whence those Presidents were brought,
there was a Face of War. We <hi>Answered,</hi>
That could not alter the Case, for the Law
calls no time a time of War, whilst the
Courts of Justice have freedom, as they
had when <hi>Strafford, Finch, Canterbury</hi> and
<hi>Ratcliff</hi> were Impeached, and it was strange
that in the Parliament-House there should
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95134:40"/>
be such a Consternation as to make their
Proceedings invalid, when in other Courts
there were none: Besides, in <hi>Holland</hi> of
many Years there was a constant Scene for
War, and can we imagine that there was
not Justice done at that time.</p>
                  <p>Then they pressed Presidents against
ours, One 14 <hi>Ed,</hi> 2. against the <hi>Spencers,</hi>
where a great Man moved the King to
Commit one of them, and the King An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>it could not be unless Cause was shewed.</hi>
We <hi>Replyed,</hi> This was a President like that,
a Man was Committed, because he was
Committed, for there was no Allegation
of Treason.</p>
                  <p>Second President was 38 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. against
Lord <hi>Stanhope,</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> moved the King
to Imprison him, and the King Answered
<hi>he would consider of it.</hi> We <hi>Answered,</hi> That
was no denyal, but a thing usual with the
King, and that Motion was to the King
himself, which differs from this Case, for
that was not alledged to be Treason: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
had it been Treason, it was against
the King himself, and being an Offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himself, he might (if he would) not
Imprison, because he may discharge a Man,
or pardon him, tho' for Treason; but this
Case is not so, because the Lords Justice is
but Ministred to the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:95134:40"/>
21 <hi>R. 2 Arundell</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
who as they said was Impeached of
Treason, but not Committed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> The Case was this, There was a
Commission Issued out by <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. That that
Bishop and others should regulate what
was amiss by evil Government, and the
King was offended at the granting of it,
and at <hi>Nottingham</hi> sent for the Judges, and
charged them upon their Allegiance to give
true Answer to what Questions he should
ask them, and the first Question was, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Commission so granted, was not inva
ding his Prerogative?</hi> They Answered, <hi>Yes,</hi>
Then he asked <hi>how they ought to be punished
who procured it?</hi> They Answered, <hi>as Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
In the 21 the Bishop is charged by
the <hi>Commons,</hi> and the Treason alledged is,
That he had procured himself to be put
into the Commission.</p>
                  <p>This being the Case, we said, That if a
Fact be called Treason, which afterwards
appears to be none, there could be no
Commitment, for if a Man call another
Mans coming into his Ground Treason, it
falls of it self; therefore the Bishop was
not Committed.</p>
                  <p>The Lords said farther, That all those
Articles were declared to be Treason,
which before could not possibly be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95134:41"/>
to Commit a Man, because the Nature
of them must be Treason at Common-Law,
and till these Treasons were declared,
which was not till 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. they were not
Treason so as to Imprison, or Try any Man
for them.</p>
                  <p>We <hi>Reply'd,</hi> All that Parliament was
Repealed, yet the President was the more
Authentic. But I think that Lord (it was
the Earl of <hi>B</hi>—<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

what he said, at least I did not.</p>
                  <p>Then about the Earl of <hi>Strafford's</hi> Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
the Lords said, that the very Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment was taken away by the Act of
this Parliament, because the Impeachment
is recited in it. Namely, Whereas the Earl
of <hi>Strafford</hi> was Impeached <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Clause in that Act of Attainder is taken
away now, therefore the Impeachment;
and you cannot make use of any part
of it.</p>
                  <p>We <hi>Replyed,</hi> it's true, the Act of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is taken away, but the very Act of
Repeal doth recite that very Clause (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and the Act cannot take away
any thing which strengthens its own Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:95134:41"/>
Then the Lords said, That they should
be willing to comply with the <hi>Commons,</hi>
but that they must be tender of their own
Judicial Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commons.</hi> Its true they ought, and we
supposed that the Lords might be jealous
that we should Intrench on their Power,
but the <hi>Commons</hi> were so far from that,
that they thought the Judicial Power bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
lodg'd with them then in the <hi>Commons</hi>
themselves could be; but we would open
the <hi>Objection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their Lordships being the Judges in this
Case might think, that for the <hi>Commons</hi> to
take upon them to know what was Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
would be an assuming to themselves
what was only proper to the Lords, and
that it was so now in Charging the Earl of
<hi>Clarendon</hi> generally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lords.</hi> The <hi>Objection</hi> is right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commons.</hi> For our knowing Treason,
we have many among us, who are Justices
of Peace, trusted by Law to know and
Commit, (and if the Parliament be not
Sitting) even to Commit a Peer himself
for Treason, and the knowing what is
Treason is so far from being improper to
the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> That every Man in
the Nation is bound to know it; for was it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95134:42"/>
ever known, that Ignorance of the Law
could ever excuse a Man from breaking the
Law? Laws are made to be known by
Subjects, especially those which concern
the King; and unless they could find a
Reason, why the Parliment Embodyed
should be more ignorant than particular
Persons, the present Case must be clear.
That the Jealousie of the Lords arose from
a Fallacy, thus, The Lords have Judicial
Power concerning Treason, and mnst of
necessity know in; the Common have no
Judicial Power over it, therefore cannot
know it; that is, because the Commons
know what Law is, therefore they have
Judicial Power over Law. To this was not
any thing <hi>Replyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Farther, We said that because they insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon to specifie Treason, because by
Committing upon a general, they might
wrong the Party by Committing him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Cause, and because they themselves were
not informed in their Consciences what
they did: They would do well to consider
the many Inconveniencies which might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
if the Charge of Treason was not
general, but particular; and suppose it was
Special, their Lordships would know no
more by it. For suppose a Man Impeached
for Counterfeiting the Great Seal, which
is express Treason, and he may be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
for it, yet neither their Lordships
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95134:42"/>
nor the Party could have any advantage by
that Specification, because there might be
as many Questions what is Counterfeiting
the Great Seal, or what is Treason.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For Instance.</hi> One <hi>Leak</hi> a <hi>Clerk</hi> in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi>
intending to Forge a Patent, puts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
two pieces of Parchment, and had
fitted them, and put them together with
Mouth-Glew, that they appear'd as one:
Then a Grant was written upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
and a Seal affix'd, so that the Great
Seal is put to a true Thing, then he cuts
off the edges of the Parchment, so as to
sever them, takes off the written One, and
leaves the Seal on the Blank, then Forgeth
the Grant and makes use of it. This was
questioned before the Judges, whether 'twas
Treason or not, that is, whether Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
the Great Seal or not? If it were,
it was Treason, otherwise not. They <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,</hi>
it was not Counterfeiting the Great
Seal, and so not, but Misprison. And if
it had been Treason, they <hi>Resolved,</hi> that an
Indictment had been enough to Impeach
him. Then suppose you have such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
before you for Counterfeiting
the Great Seal, you have Special Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Imprison him; but when it is
brought to Question, it appears not to
be Treason, therefore he is wrong Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned:
And if your Lordships will examine
what knowledg you have of this Fact, you
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95134:43"/>
have no more then if it had been a general
Treason.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lords.</hi> There is a Case put there, as we
are content to take a Special Treason, but
expect not the Proof as there it was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commons.</hi> If it were a Case put, so is
your Lordships <hi>Reply,</hi> for it was put <hi>ex
Concesso,</hi> because you agreed that if the
Treason was Special, the Party was to be
Committed, and this Case was to show
their Lordships, they were in no better
Case then, than if the Treason were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>But the Lords still pressing that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
it self of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi>
was Repeal'd in the Act about him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commons.</hi> We <hi>Reply'd</hi> one part of the
Act ought to be severed from the other,
and that which is without exception shall
stand, tho' the other be taken away: For,
suppose a Man Prosecutes in a Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
for what he apprehends to be his right,
and yet the Cause goes against him, and he
hath no effect of his Suit, afterward the
Party (being an evil minded Man, and
thinking to reach his Ends) Forgeth a
Deed, or Suborns Witnesses, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
a Suit in some other Court, and by
those ways attains his Ends. Then a Bill
comes before this Parliament to Reverse
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95134:43"/>
the Judgment, reciting that such a Person
hath been a Suborner of Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
so, and so, and therefore the Judgment is
made void; certainly tho' this Person is
named to be an evil minded Person, yet
this lays no blemish on his first Proceedings.
So that it appears by the Act, that the
Proceedings against the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>
were legal at first, if those afterwards,
when the times became tumultuous, were
not, it is not to be applyed to what was
well done and legal: Then we told them
that we had pressed them with four Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents,
and to three of them nothing was
Replyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lords.</hi> They Answered the Reason why
my Lord <hi>Finch</hi> was Committed, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his Flight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commons.</hi> He was fled before the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,
but it was <hi>Ordered,</hi> That he
should be Committed when found.</p>
                  <p>Then we told them, That we must Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to them, that be the Treason what it
would, we could not go to the Lords to
have it punished without that disadvantage,
which the Publishing the Treason before-hand
would expose us to by making of
Witnesses, escaping of Parties, and the
like; then bad them consider, whether if
we should lay before them a Treason in
every Thing circumstanced as <hi>Gun-Powder
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95134:44"/>
Treason,</hi> they would not Imprison the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
till the whole Matter was opened.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lords.</hi> They Answered to hear that Case
put, for in Matter of State, other Courses
are to be taken, and they could see no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency
in Publishing that to the
Lords, which must be Published before
400 in the <hi>House of Commons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commons.</hi> The Commons may proceed
with what secresie or openness they please,
and the Lords are not to take Notice of
their Proceedings, whether open or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
                  <p>Farther, That by a Matter of State must
be understood, when a Parliament is not
Sitting, and we know not whether to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort,
but when a Parliament is particularly
called to prevent the Mischiefs threatning
the Kingdom, If that be not capable of
Remedying, no other Council could, or we
are not bound to resort to that, we are
excluded ftom that to which we ought
to resort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lords.</hi> That the Lords had us take heed
of the Liberty of the Subjects, to which
they are now fain to have Regard, bidding
us consider the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury's</hi> long
Imprisonment, without knowing the Cause,
and they must satisfie their Consciences,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95134:44"/>
lest they should Commit for Treason, and
it not prov'd so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commons.</hi> It appears not that the Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> should have lain less time,
had the Impeachment been Special; and for
the Liberty of the Subject, we know not
how a Subject should have more Liberty
by Special Matter than General; Special
being but adding a formal Title, and the
subject goes to Prison, as well for the one
as the other.</p>
                  <p>For their Consciences. Suppose a Person
accused generally, they are then to know
whether it be Treason, and is not it as
much that they Commit an Innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so? as if the matter was Special.</p>

                  <p>The Matter before us, is
of as great concernment as ever came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us; if there should be Malice supposed
in a Nation against it self, it might be
exercised by giving a particular Charge,
as well as a General, many of the Lords
are convinced by the Reasons we gave, and
Concur, thinking our Presidents good, and
have entred their Protestation in the Lords
House, asserting the Rights of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> to Impeach generally;
So that (excepting the Spiritual Lords) I
think I may say the Major part of the
Lords are for us; and should we give up
this, we may be wrested out of all Right,
and the Commons have no way to proceed
to an Impeachment, but some Men to be
so great, as not to be fairly reach'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Wall.</speaker>
                  <p>The Lords are a noble Estate,
but whatever the Matter is, they have of
late some Advice given them, which makes
them proceed as they never did yet, for
scarce any Thing happens betwixt us, but
they incroach upon us. The <hi>Militia</hi> is now
as burthensome to the Fifty Pound Man in
the Country, almost as all other Taxes,
and the Lords have gotten this Advantage
on us, that they touch not the Burthen of
it with their Finger: So in time of the
Plague, the Commons must be shut up, but
not they, insomuch that a good Act pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95134:45"/>
to that purpose passed not; we Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd
the Lord <hi>Mordant,</hi> and could not
bring him to the Bar, (tho' formerly I have
known an <hi>Earl</hi> and a <hi>Lord</hi> brought thither)
you desired a free Conference about it, but
could not obtain one to this Day. <hi>Rome</hi>
was at first modest, and only medled with
Spirituals, but afterwards concerned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so much with other Matters, that
every Thing almost was made to be in <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
ad Spiritualia,</hi> and many Kingdoms
thereupon break from them. The Lords
now insist upon one Thing, because they
say 'tis in order to their Judicature, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
hereafter they will tell us we must
come to them on our Knees, because it is
in order to their Judgment. Consider
therefore whether there be any hope of
giving them satisfaction; then, whether
you will adhere, and what you will do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards;
for the present my Motion is to
adhere.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Vaugh.</speaker>
                  <p>It is truly said, the Business
before you seems to be as great as hath
been in Parliament, many of the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
being invisible; therefore before
you <hi>Resolve</hi> what to do take the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before you.</p>
                  <p>The difference between the Lords and us,
is upon a general Impeachment of Treason;
the Lords after a Free Conference say, they
will not Commit unless Special Treason
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95134:46"/>
be mentioned or assign'd, those whom you
employed to Manage the Conference were
very unwilling to differ with them, but it
seems it hath Produced nothing, and I have
nothing to make me believe, but that the
Reason is, that the Lords were <hi>Resolved</hi>
(say what we would) not to be satisfied;
for I know nothing which they Offer'd,
but it was fully Answer'd, nor any thing
left undone to satisfie them if they would
have been satisfied; what I have to say now
is to clear something which the Lords may
make much sound of.</p>
                  <p>When we urged Presidents, and made
them our principal Reason, we told them,
the way to decide what was in Difference
betwixt the <hi>Houses,</hi> is, the usuage of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments;
but to our Presidents we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no full Answer.</p>
                  <p>Then the Lords used this Reason, Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they cared not for Presidents,
because it was against the Express Law of
the Land.</p>
                  <p>I Answer'd them we would join with
them, if they could shew Law against it,
and expected what they would Answer, but
heard nothing: Much discourse there was,
without Application, of the <hi>Great Charter,</hi>
and of the Statute of 28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. but not
applyed; so that I thought Law in a
Lords Mouth, was like a Sword in a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Hand, the Sword might be there, but
when it comes to cut, itwould be awkward
and useless.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:95134:46"/>
But I hear since, that their meaning was
this, (which must be cleared by mentioning
some Laws) that by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> it is
provided, <hi>That no Man shall be taken or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned,
or Condemned but by the Law;</hi> and
thence they infer, That no Man may be
Imprisoned, but it must be by the <hi>Peers,</hi> or
by the Law of the Land.</p>
                  <p>Again, 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. No Woman shall be
attached upon Accusation, or be adjudged
of Life or Limb, but according to the
Law.</p>
                  <p>25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. No Man shall be taken by a
Petition to the King or his Council, unless
by Indictment of lawful People, or by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Writ at Common-Law, and (say
they) this Case is to none of these.</p>
                  <p>28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. No Man shall be Imprisoned
without due Process according to the Old
Law of the Land: But this Case being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Presentment nor Indictment, the
Lords would not stand upon our Presidents,
but relied on this, as if it were enough in
Bar of all our Presidents.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to open this, and the danger
of the Consequence, there are in the Land
many different Laws, and proceedings in
these Laws, and Imprisonment upon them;
and yet not one of them by Presentment,
Indictment, or Tryal by Peers, tho the
Lords thought this was the Law and there
was no other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:95134:47"/>
1. It is known that the Crown-Law, or
Prerogative, is distinct Law from that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Party and Party.</p>
                  <p>2. There is the Law and Custom of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
called a Law, <hi>ab omnibus quaerenda,
a multis ignorata, &amp; a paucis Cognita.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Then the Cannon-Law, (and it is
much the Bishops forgot that) and there is
nothing in that Law, more than standing
in a White Sheet, which proceeds not by
Indictment or Presentment, yet there is
Imprisonment even in that Law.</p>
                  <p>4. There is the Law of Admiralty, and
the Articles of <hi>Cleron,</hi> where there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of another Nature, and by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment.</p>
                  <p>5. The Law of Merchants, or of the
Staple.</p>
                  <p>6. The Law of Arms, where is Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
and Death, and yet different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
from the Common-Law in the
Great <hi>Charter:</hi> Now no Man thinks that
all those Courses of Proceedings are taken
away by the Common-Law, and it is gross
Ignorance to think it.</p>
                  <p>7. The Law of the Forrest, which is
most different: So that to urge <hi>Magna
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95134:47"/>
Charta</hi> to this purpose, as if all Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
in those Cases must be according to
the Common-Law, is absurd.</p>
                  <p>Then there are divers Writs in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister.</p>
                  <p>One, When a Man hath received the
King's Money to serve him, and went not,
then there is a Writ to Arrest him upon
a Certificate from the Captain under whom
he was to serve.</p>
                  <p>Then the ordinary Writ, which belongs
to the Law Ecclesiastic, <hi>de Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Capiendo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another, <hi>de Apostata Capiendo,</hi> to recover
a Regular Run-away from his Convent.</p>
                  <p>Another, called <hi>ne exeat Regno,</hi> to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison
a Man, who will not give Security
not to go out of the Kingdom, and this is
not Traversable any where, because it sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
that he will <hi>Machinat</hi> somewhat
hurtful to the Kingdom, and upon that
Suggestion he is Imprisoned.</p>
                  <p>Another, when a Man hath a <hi>Leprosie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another, to burn <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
the Bishops also, if they had pleas'd
to think of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:95134:48"/>
These Proceedings are no way agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to those mentioned in the Common-Law</p>
                  <p>Then consider how this <hi>Resolution</hi> of the
Lords strikes at the Law of Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>1. It is certain that all Imprisonment
by Parliament is not by Presentment, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that by this means that
Power is taken away.</p>
                  <p>2. Contempt against Parliamentary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
whosoever he is to appear before
them, and disobeys them, they may Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
him in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and yet it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whither therefore tends this?</p>
                  <p>The Conclusion must be, that no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
by the <hi>Commons</hi> must go on,
unless it be by Presentment, and so there is
an end of all that for which the Parliament
is principally called, unless we are part of
those 500 contemptible Ones, who are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fit to give Money; <hi>That</hi> may be reserved
for us, but nothing else; tho' 23 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
saith, <hi>For redress of grievances in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
a Parliament shall be called every Year.</hi> I
would know which way we should redress
Abuses, if we are so far from remedying in
Parliament, that we must be shut out to
the Common Courses in other Courts?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:95134:48"/>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> The Lords may say, if you find the
Statutes broken, and short, you shall have
New.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> And when these New Ones are
broken, then we shall have a Remedy, so
rise up Remedy, and go to the Remedy,
<hi>ad infinitum,</hi> for there is no more Reason to
think that a Second Law shall be maintained
more than the First, and what way a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
shall be Redressed, other than by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
I know not.</p>
                  <p>So that by this <hi>Resolution</hi> of the Lords,
and denying to Commit upon this Ground
(for they shew'd no other) every Thing
for which a Parliament is useful is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us.</p>
                  <p>After all this come to the very Case.</p>
                  <p>If a Treason be Committed, and the
Fame is that <hi>A. B.</hi> is guilty of it, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to Apprehend him for it. If <hi>Hue</hi> and
<hi>Cry</hi> pursue a Man, tho' he be not of evil
Fame, yet he may lawfully be Imprisoned:
If it proves false, he hath his Remedy;
but that obstructs not the Law to bring
him to Tryal: Any Watch-Man may Arrest
a Night-Walker, and hath a Warrant in
Law for it, and this is as good Process in
Law, as any original Writ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:95134:49"/>
And after all this, Consider with what
Kind of Colour, when there are weighty
Reasons why we should not mention spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Treason, and that mentioning it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
answers the Petition of Right,
the whole Commons of <hi>England</hi> (who are
in no degree represented by the Lords,
They only represent their own Persons)
should be denied the Securing a Person
Impeached unless a particular charge be
given how prejudicial so ever to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>Another thing, there is no Right which
a Man hath in this Land, or any part of
the World, but his Right is such, that if
it be kept from him, he hath a means to
come to it, otherways it is <hi>Damnum sine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria;</hi>
for where the Law gives no remedy,
there is but a supposition of Right: By the
same measure it will follow, that there is
no civil wrong can be done to any Man,
but the Law provides a Remedy if that
wrong be done; and if by the Law there
is no Remedy, it is no wrong, consider then
this Case.</p>
                  <p>There are in this Kingdom in the Civil
State of it, three Estates, which the King
hath then in making Laws: There are three
Estates, whereof the King is Principal;
sometimes they are mentioned as the King's
three Estates, and he none of them: The
Estates in general are, the Commons of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95134:49"/>
Kingdom, (who are perfectly represented
in this <hi>House</hi>) the Lords another, and the
King another, and these are such, that
there is no Petitory Action, nor the Laws
directed to any one of them, but the Laws
you make are to distribute Justice in other
Courts.</p>
                  <p>For Instance, If all the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(who are one of the Estates) should
Accuse one of themselves, the Party can
have no wrong, because the Parliament
can have no Action brought against them,
nor can they be supposed to do any thing
for Malice.</p>
                  <p>It is the same between the Body of the
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons;</hi> and there is no Law
either to Vindicate the one or the other;
but they stand as if there were no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
Law betwixt them; but the
measure between them is that which is
good for the whole; for they are the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of Laws for others, but no Laws can
be fancied to reach the whole of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
or of the <hi>Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that 'tis easily to be seen, how it hath
been put upon us; so that now we are in
such a Case, we know not to what end we
shall proceed upon this or any other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment;
for by this Judicial power,
you shall be excluded from any proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95134:50"/>
by Laws of Parliaments, and so you
take away the whole Right of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But now what shall you do?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I see many Inconveniencies which
may happen both ways, but I see so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
this way, that if any Man gave such
Councel as is Charged upon the Earl of
<hi>Clarendon,</hi> it is not so dangerous as the
Case before you; for the Inconveniencies
attending that Councel would quickly shew
it self by the Misery following: But this
is a small thing begun with, which, like
a Canker, may eat till it be uncurable,
and that is as absolutely justifiable as
this.</p>
                  <p>And now I have said this, I am perplexed
what to say more, for all can bear me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
what respect I have endeavoured to
preserve to the <hi>House of Peers,</hi> but I am so
sensible of this, that tho' I cannot forget
my respect to them, yet I must lament the
Condition into which they have brought
themselves first, and us next, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think to avoid it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>House of Peers</hi> is but a New Stile,
called so, as <hi>Iurors</hi> are called <hi>Peers,</hi> from the
Word <hi>Par;</hi> for every <hi>Commoner</hi> hath his
<hi>Peers</hi> as Lords have; and the whole Stile
formerly was <hi>Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Dukes,</hi>
&amp;c.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95134:50"/>
But <hi>Pares Regni</hi> is a new Stile. It is
called the <hi>Vpper House,</hi> and is to be look't
upon with Reverence. The Lords have a
jurisdiction, but in this Case, I must be plain,
their granted Jurisdiction ariseth from the
<hi>House of Common,</hi> if you Impeach not there
your Judicial Power will be very little.
If a Lord be to be Tried for Treason, the
Lords are but his Jurors; and tho' they
Try him upon Honour, not upon Oath, yet
they are no more his Tryers, than as out of
Parliament: The Judge of Treason in the
Lords <hi>House,</hi> is Constituted by the King,
as a Lord <hi>High-Steward,</hi> and there is no
other Judge, therefore I know not the
Judicature they speak so much of.</p>
                  <p>There is another for Writs of Error,
which are there determined, but the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of that is very little, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency
of the Lords determining what
could not be determined in other Courts,
is so found out 25 <hi>Eliz.</hi> They are to be
brought first into the Exchequer Chamber.</p>
                  <p>There is another way when Persons car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Complaints to the Lords, which is a
Question, for Commoners ought not to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Complaints there, except in some Cases
from <hi>Chancery;</hi> therefore this Matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
which they talk of, is not such
a wonderful thing as they would make it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore whatever we shall do after it,
your Rights being so much concerned that
you know not where the stay will be, it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95134:51"/>
is necessary that you make a Committee to
draw up a Protestation to be made by this
<hi>House</hi> concerning this Matter, The Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your Right in it, and the danger to
the Kingdom by it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Colem.</speaker>
                  <p>The Lords say, That commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon a general Impeachment is against
Law, and I think it will appear so; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not, but a <hi>Mittimus</hi> without special
Cause is legal, and grounded upon the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Right, the Reason of which is to
secure Men against Commitment by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Warrant, and a Judge ought not to
discharge where Treason is alledged, but
in this Case it is different; The Judges
cannot discharge a Man Committed after
Examination, but the Lords ought not to
Commit a Man, except there be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Treason.</p>
                  <p>If I come before a Justice of Peace, and
say, I accuse this Man of Treason, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wise Man Commit him? he makes his
Warrant indeed, but he that accuseth must
go farther and make it more particular,
and the special Matter must appear before
he Commits, and this is the present Case.</p>
                  <p>The Common-Law is, That no Man
ought to be Committed without particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Cause; because no Man can Commit in
Capital Matters, without taking Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before hand, otherwise no Man can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
a Commitment: Therefore I am
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95134:51"/>
not satisfied that the Lords had not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to deny. The Commons are in the
nature of a <hi>Grand-Iury</hi> to present, but
the Lords are the <hi>Iudges;</hi> Commitment
is not the Judgment but in order to it,
and the Lords have a discretionary Power
in the Case: The Lords say not that they
will not Commit, but that they are not
satisfied to do it without special Matter,
therefore we ought to send it up.</p>

                  <p>I have attended the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

a Justice of Peace (it is said) must
have Evidence before he Commit, and this

and may not a <hi>House</hi> of Commons Judge
what is Treason as well as Justice of
Peace?</p>
                  <p>The Inconveniencies and Dangers laid
before you, if you proceed, are nothing in
comparison of those on the other side.</p>
                  <p>Had the Lords Imprisoned, they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this had the Particular Charge, and
the Protestation is not to stop it, but to
make way for it some other way; for it
will resolve into a Remonstrance, by which
you may give the Nation an Account of
your Proceedings to come to a Tryal of
this Business.</p>

                  <p>You sent up a Charge to the

time you would send up Articles; from
that time it hath not been done, and the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95134:53"/>
Lords have passed several Votes about it
since, but you have not passed one.</p>
                  <p>First they Voted, that they had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with your desires for want of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Treason; Then you give them Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

when the Matter of the Protestation is

Insist on, is an obstruction of Justice, and

put a Question, <hi>That the Lords, not having

                  <p>The Lords seem now mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in their Opinion at the Conference,
they said there was no fear of his Running
away, and in our <hi>House</hi> it hath been Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
that he was not like to Ride Post. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Expression in the Message is (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn)
which may be an inward Chamber,
therefore 'tis fit to desire to see the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Command some Members to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

                  <p>You cannot take Notice to
the Lords of the Petition, unless they think
good to Communicate to you, but make

                  <p>I look upon what the Lords
say as doubtful, therefore beware lest you
do something misbecoming you. They on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, that he is withdrawn, but not what
is his Petition; for the saying that he is
withdrawn, is not the Matter of a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Perhaps he is gone into the Country,
the Message seems light, and you are to take
no notice of it. If it be of Moment, and
they think us Concern'd, they should let us
know it; and I cannot think so of the
Lords, that they would use that word, if
he were fled: therefore send a Message, to
know whether fled or withdrawn.</p>

                  <p>When a Delinquent signifies
to his Judges, that he is withdrawn, it
cannot signifie any thing, but that he is
withdrawn from their Judgment. None
but a mad Man will tell them that he is fled
fearing what may follow; it would be well
if their Care would prevent his flying,
but you cannot Answer it, if you hear they
do nothing, and so seem to say, fare him
well.</p>

                  <p>I Cannot express the unsupportable
Trouble and Grief of Mind I su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
under the Apprehension of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Misrepresented to Your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,</hi>
and when I hear how much of Your
<hi>Lordships</hi> time hath been spent upon the
mention of me, as it is attended with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95134:56"/>
more publick Consequences, and of the
differences of Opinion which have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or may probably arise between Your
<hi>Lordships</hi> and the Honourable <hi>House</hi> of
<hi>Commons;</hi> whereby the great and weighty
affairs of the Kingdom may be obstructed
in the time of so general a dissatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>I am very unfortunate to find my self
to suffer so much under two very disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Reflections, which are in no
degree applicable to me.</p>
                  <p>The First from the greatness of my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
and Fortune, collected and made in so
few Years, which if it be proportionable to
what is reported, may very reasonably cause
my Integrity to be suspected.</p>
                  <p>The Second, That I have been the sole
Manager and chief Minister in all the
Transactions of State since the King's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>August</hi> last, and
therefore that all Miscarriages and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
ought to be imputed to me and my
Councels.</p>
                  <p>Concerning my Estate, Your <hi>Lordships</hi>
will not believe, that after Malice and
Envy hath been so inquisitive and so sharp
sighted I will offer any thing to Your
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95134:56"/>
                     <hi>Lordships,</hi> but what is exactly true; and
I do assure Your <hi>Lordships,</hi> in the first
place, That (excepting from the King's
Bounty) I have never received nor taken
one Penny but what was generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to be the just lawful Perquisites of
my Office, by the constant Practice of the
best Times, which I did in my own Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
conceive to be that of my Lord <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,</hi>
and my Lord <hi>Elsmore;</hi> the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of which I constantly observed, altho'
the Office in both their Times was lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worth double to what it was to me, and
I believe now is.</p>
                  <p>That all the Courtesies and Favours
which I have been able to obtain from the
King for other Persons in <hi>Church</hi> or
<hi>State,</hi> or in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been worth me Five Pounds: So that
Your <hi>Lordships</hi> may be confident I am as
innocent from Corruption as from any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal
Thought, which after near Thirty
Years Service of the Crown, in some Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and Distresses, I did never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
would be objected to me in my Age.</p>
                  <p>And I do assure Your <hi>Lordships,</hi> and
shall make it very Manifest, That the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95134:57"/>
several Sums of Money, and some Parcels
of Land, which His Majesty hath Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
bestowed upon me since his return
into <hi>England,</hi> are worth more than all I
have amounts unto; so far I am from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
my Estate by indirect means.
And tho' this Bounty of his hath very
far exceeded my Merit, or my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet some others have been as fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
at least in the same Bounty who had
as small pretences to it, and have no great
Reason to envy my condition.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the other Imputation of the
Credit and Power of being chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and so causing all to be done that I
had a mind to, I have no more to say,
than that I had the good fortune to serve
a Muster of a very great Iudgment and
Vnderstanding, and be always joyn'd with
Persons of great Ability and Experience,
without whose Advice and Concurrence,
never any thing hath been done.</p>
                  <p>Before His Majesty's coming into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he was constantly attended by the
then Marquess of <hi>Oumond,</hi> the late Lord
<hi>Culpeper,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Secretary Nicholas,</hi>
who were equally trusted with my self, and
without whose Ioynt Advice and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95134:57"/>
when they were all present (as some
of them always were) I never gave any
Councel. As soon as it pleased God to
bring His Majesty into <hi>England,</hi> he Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
his <hi>Privy Council,</hi> and shortly,
out of them he Choose a Number of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Persons of great Reputation (who
for the most part are still alive) as a
Committee for Forreign Affairs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of such things as in the Nature
of them required much Secrefie, and with
these Persons he vouchsafed to Ioyn me:
And I am confident this Committee never
transacted any thing of Moment (His
Majesty being always present) without
presenting the same first to the Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Board,
and I must appeal to them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Carriage, and whether we were not
all of one Mind, in Matters of Importance.</p>
                  <p>For more than two Years I never knew
any Differences in the Councils, or that
there were any Complaints in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which I wholly impute to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
great Wisdom, and the intire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of his Councellours, without the
Vanity of assuming any thing to my self;
and therefore I hope I shall not be singly
charged with any thing that hath since
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95134:58"/>
fal'n out amiss. But from the time Mr.
<hi>Secretary Nicholas</hi> was removed from his
Place, there were great Alterations; and
whosoever knew any thing of the Court
and Councils, know well how much my
Credit hath since that time been dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
tho' His Majesty graciously vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
still to here my Advice in most of
his Affairs: nor hath there been, from that
time to this, above one or two Persons
brought to the Council, or preferr'd to
any considerable Office in the Court who
have been of my intimate Acquaintance,
or suspected to have any kindness for me;
and most of them, most Notoriously known
to have been very long my Enemies, and
of different Iudgment and Principles from
me, both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and have
taken all opportunities to lessen my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
with the King, and with all other
Persons, by Mis-representing and Mis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
all that I said or did, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
Men I have done them some
prejudice with His Majesty, or crossed
them in some of their Pretensions; Tho'
His Majesty's Goodness and Iustice was
such, that it made little Impression upon
him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:95134:58"/>
In my humble Opinion, the great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of the Kingdom have proceeded
from the War, to which it is Notoriously
known that I was always most averse,
and may without vanity say, I did not
only foresee, but declare the Mischiefs
we should run into, by Entering into a
War, before any Alliances made with the
Neighbouring Princes, and that it may
not be imputed to His Majesty's want of
Care, or the Negligence of his Councellors,
that no such Alliances were entered into,
I must take the boldness to say, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
left nothing unattempted in order
thereunto; and knowing very well, that
<hi>France</hi> Resolved to begin a War upon
<hi>Spain,</hi> as soon as his <hi>Catholick Majesty</hi>
should depart this World, which being
much sooner expected by them, They had
in the two Winters before been at great
Charges in providing plentiful Magazeens
of all Provisions upon the Frontiers, that
they might be ready for the War, His
Majesty used all possible means to prepare
and dispose the <hi>Spaniard</hi> with that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
offering his Friendship to that
degree, as might be for the Benefit and
Security of both <hi>Crowns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:95134:59"/>
But <hi>Spain</hi> flattering it self. That
<hi>France</hi> would not break with them, at
least, that they would not give them any
Cause by Administring Matter of Iealousie
to them, never made any real approach
towards a Friendship with His Majesty,
but, both by their Embassadors here, and
to His Majesty's Embassador at <hi>Madrid,</hi>
always persisted, as Preliminaries, upon
the giving up of <hi>Dunkirk, Tangier</hi> and
<hi>Jamaica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho' <hi>France</hi> had an Embassador here,
to whom a Project of a Treaty was offered,
and the Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi> His Majesty's Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
at <hi>Paris,</hi> used all endeavours to
pursue and prosecute the said Treaty, yet
it was quickly discerned, That the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Design of <hi>France</hi> was to draw His
Majesty into such a nearer Alliance as
might advance their Design; without
which, they had no mind to Enter into
the Treaty proposed.</p>
                  <p>And this was the State of Affairs when
the War was Entred into with the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
from which time, neither <hi>Crown</hi> much
considered the making any Alliance with
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:95134:59"/>
As I did from my Soul abhor the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into this War, so I presumed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to give any Advice or Councel for
the way of managing it, but by opposing
many Propositions, which seemed to the
late <hi>Lord</hi> Treasurer and my self to be
unreasonable, as the payment of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
by Tickets, and many other Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
which added to the Expence.</p>
                  <p>My Enemies took all occasions to enveigh
against me, and making their Friendship
with others out of the Council, of more
licencious Principles, and who knew well
enough how much I disliked and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Liberty they took to themselvs
of reviling all Councils and Councellours,
and turning all things Serious and Sacred
into ridicule, They took all ways ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to render me ungrateful to all
sorts of <hi>Men,</hi> (whom I shall be compelled
to Name in my Defence) perswading those
that miscarryed in any of their Designs,
That it was the Chancellours doing;
whereof, I never knew any thing. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they could not withdraw the King's
Favour from me, who was still pleased
to use my Service with others, nor was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95134:60"/>
there ever any thing done but with the
joynt Advice of at least the Major part
of those who were consulted with. And
as His Majesty commanded my Service in
the late Treaties, so I never gave the
least Advice in private, nor wrote one
Letter to any one Person in either of
those Negotiations but upon the Advice
of the Council, and also after it was read
in Council, or at least by the King himself,
and some other; and if I prepared any
Instructions or Memorials, it was by the
King's Command, and the request of the
Secretaries who desired my Assistance;
nor was it any wish of my own, that any
Embassador should give me any account
of the Transactions, but to the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to whom I was always ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise;
nor am I conscious to my self of
ever having given Advice that hath
proved mischievous or inconvenient to His
Majesty; and I have been so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sole Manager of Affairs, that I
have not in the whole last Year been above
twice with His Majesty in any Room a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and very seldom in the two or three
Years preceding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:95134:60"/>
And since the Parliament at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
it hath been very visible, that
my Credit hath been very little, and that
very few things have been hearkned to,
which have been proposed by me, but
contradicted, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by me.</p>
                  <p>I most humbly beseech Your <hi>Lordships</hi>
to remember the Office and Trust I had
for seven Years, in which, in Discharge
of my Duty I was obliged to stop and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
many Mens pretences, and refused
to set the Seal to many Pardens and other
Grants, which would have been profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to those who procured them, and many
whereof, upon my Representation to His
Majesty, were for ever stopt, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
have raised many Enemies to me:
And my frequent concurring, upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of the late Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> (with
whom I had the Honour to have a long
and vast Friendship to his Death) in
Representing several Excesses and Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances,
the yearly Issue so far exceeding
the Revenues, provoked many Persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
of great Power and Credit, to d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:95134:61"/>
me all the ill Offices they could. And
yet I may faithfully say, That I never
medled with any part of the Revenue or
the Administration of it, but when I was
desired by the late Lord <hi>Treasurer</hi> to
give him my Assistance and Advice,
having had the Honour formerly to serve
the <hi>Crown</hi> as <hi>Chancellour</hi> of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi>
which was for the most part in
His Majesty's presence. Nor have I ever
been in the least degree concern'd, in point
of Profit, in letting any part of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
Revenue; nor have ever Treated or
Debated it, but in His Majesty's presence,
in which my Opinion concurr'd always
with the Major part of the Councellours
who were present.</p>
                  <p>All which, upon Examination, will be
made manifest to Your <hi>Lordships,</hi> how
much soever my Integrity is blasted by
the Malice of those who I am confident do
not believe themselves. Nor have I in
my Life, upon all the Treaties, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
received the value of one Shilling
from all the Kings or Princes in the World,
(excepting the Books of the <hi>Louvre</hi>
Print sent me by the <hi>Chancellour</hi> of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95134:61"/>
                     <hi>France</hi> by that Kings direction) but from
my own Master, to whose intire Service,
and the Good and Welfare of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
no Man's Heart was every more
devoted.</p>
                  <p>This being my present Condition; I
do most humbly beseech Your <hi>Lordships</hi> to
entertain a favourable Opinion of me, and
to believe me to be Innocent from those
foul Aspersions, untill the contrary shall
proved; which I am sure can never be
by any Man worthy to be believed: And
since the Distempers of the Times, and
the Difference between the two <hi>Houses</hi>
in the present Debate, with the Power
and Malice of my Enemies, Who gave
out that I should prevail with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to Prorogue or Dissolve this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Displeasure, and threaten to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
me to the Rage and Fury of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
may make me to be look'd upon as the
Cause which obstructs the Kings Service,
and Vnity and Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>I most humbly beseech Your <hi>Lordships,</hi>
that I may not forfeit Your <hi>Lordships</hi>
Favour and Protection, by With-drawing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95134:62"/>
my self from so powerful a Persecution, in
hope that I may be able, by such with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing,
hereafter to appear, and make
my Defence, when His Majesty's Iustice
(to which I shall always submit) may not
be Obstructed, or Controled, by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Malice of those who have sworn my
Destruction.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I think it not convenient to
loose more time about this Paper. Since the
time of the Earl of <hi>Clarendons</hi> Name being
mention'd here, I had nothing to Charge
him with till now, but most of the Heads
of this Charge are so weighty, that I am
confident, they will be easily and thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proved, tho' I know not how; so that I
admire at his Confidence, to Charge this
House, and so the Nation, as his Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and that in such a Condition, as he
hopes to vindicate himself. Its the first
time that ever I heard an Innocent Man
run away under the greatest Charge, with
hopes to return again and vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:95134:62"/>
Then mark one Expression; he saith, <hi>he
is as far from Corruption, as from Disloyalty:</hi>
If he said he was guilty of neither, he had
said something; but by that Expression he
may be guilty of both: So insolent a Paper
I never met with in this Kingdom, nor have
I ever read the like in any other; so inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a part of the Nation as he is to lay
it upon the Nation, who, if innocent,
might defend himself, if Guilty, why doth
he Charge the Nation with persecuting?
Therefore without troubling your selves
with it, do, as the Lords have done; who
deliver it to you as a Scandalous and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Paper; it hath Malice in it, and is the

<hi>Scandalous and Seditious, and doth Reproach
the King and the Publick Iustice of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <p>The meaning of my Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

therefore desire the Lords Concurrence to

                  <p>I am against sending up to

have Ordered to enter the Paper into your

to stand upon Record, but should be rased

therefore let it rest as it is;
We have Voted it <hi>Scandalous, &amp;c.</hi> The
Lords tell us not that they have done any
such Thing, tho' they ought to have done
it first.</p>
                  <p>As for the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> he being
now gone, if such a like occasion should fall
out, we are in a worse Condition than we
were; for there is this President against us,
in a Case now Manifest: And it becomes us
to do something in Order to the Lords
Concurring, that so a good Understanding
may be got; therefore I shall propound
this to you, to be sent up to them to
that end.</p>
                  <p>Namely, when any Subject shall be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
by the Commons before the Lords
in Parliament with desire to secure him,
such Person by the Law of the Land ought
to be secured accordingly. This you have
in effect Voted already, in saving the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

doing it.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> when such Impeached Persons
shall be secured, the Lords may limit a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
time for bringing in the Charge, to
prevent delay of Justice.</p>
                  <p>This may Salve all, and prevent such
ways, as may be displeasing to the Lords.

ought to secure, but they not having done
it, I question whether you could do what
you have, but the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> flying,
it is Manifest Justice was obstructed; for
he might have been brought to his Tryal,
if the Lords had secured him; but now your

                  <p>Tho' you should put both

what Part you grant of it, that is the last,

there is another Reason, why you should

                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> being gone, there
is an expectation that a Bill should be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to do something farther, wherein I hope
both Houses will join; if you send up this,
you will give disturbance to that Bill, and
if you should enter this in your Books, in

is: You have Voted, That when a Man is
generally Impeached, he ought to be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and that the Lords not having done
it, is an obstruction to Justice; and what
will it signifie to carry it to the Lords?
what hath since fal'n out, justifies you,
and lays the disadvantage upon the Lords:
The World expects now what you will
do farther, and that must be by Concurring
with the Lords.</p>

what is the use of it? You have already
done it in your Books, and you cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the Lords should go so much against
their own Votes, this therefore will but
widen the Gap, it being telling them they
must eat their words.</p>

                  <p>Those, who have had a
hand in the charge against the Earl of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon,</hi>
have been thought sometimes too
Violent, sometimes too Remiss, as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make out the Charge: But what I
speak now, is for your Honour, which will
be wrong'd in this Proceeding; I am for
bringing the Impeachment to something;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95134:66"/>
and therefore against these Votes: Now
you make a Declaration of your own
Rights, and Enter it upon your Books, that
not only the Vote may appear, but the
Ground of it, but not to declare to the
Lords, which will beget an Answer and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate.
It is now unseasonable to make
the Lords retract, therefore lay it aside; for
tho' I am confident that Gentleman did it
to no such end, yet if I would Design any

than the Declaration as Things now stand,

                  <p>The Motion to read the
Bill is not against your Order, because
part of the Reasons given by the Lords
is, <hi>That you have a Bill, and till you have
read the Bill, you cannot lay by the Reasons.</hi>
The Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> is fled, you have a
tye upon him in having his Innocent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and by Proceeding farther, you
make him desperate, you are now in an
even way with the Lords; therefore read
the Bill.</p>
               </sp>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Swins.</speaker>
                  <p>You may go upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and yet not reject the Bill; for when
you sent to the Lords about a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and went not upon the Bill, it was,
because what the Bill drives at is the
highest Punishment next to Death. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Consider what weight is in the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
One of them seeming to put you
upon the Bill, they put you thereupon on a
Legislative Way; they will neither Secure
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95134:68"/>
nor Summon him, but will Condemn him
Unheard. They cannot Secure him upon
a Charge of Treason, nor yet Summon
him, but they can Condemn him; and this
they put you upon, which is against Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Justice, especially to do it up
on Reason of State. The Legislative Power
of Parliaments is great, it hath no bound
but the Integrity and Justice of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
If Reason of State be a Motive
of Parliament to Banish one Man, so it
may be for many. If you go in this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative
way, you bring upon your selves
all the Dishonour of the Business, but the
Lords will have some excuse, which you
cannot, for they look'd upon the Charge
so flight, as not to Imprison him; the
party is gone, because he was not Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
apprehending (he saith) fear of the
Multitude, not of his Tryal, so that the
Lords not giving Credit to your Charge
against him, he says, <hi>he flies not from justice.</hi>
Now, if upon this Bill you shall Banish
him, it would be said you could not make
good the Charge; and therefore laid this
Sentence upon him.</p>
                  <p>The President is also dangerous, if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gone so far in a Judicial Way, you
should now go in a Legislative. If upon
Reason of State Lords may be Banished,
it may be by dozens: As you proceed
Justly, so you will be Justified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:95134:69"/>
Nor is the Danger greater if the Lords
go by Proclamation, and he be put into
Custody when he comes, if he can practice
any Thing, will not he be less capable
when under the Proclamation, than when
this Bill is Passed, which Condemns him
without Hearing, and I am not for any
Punishment till Heard. In <hi>Cromwells</hi> Case,
who Moved in <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. time, to Attaint
a Lord Unheard, the Judges declared they
might, and it would stand, afterward the
said <hi>Cromwell</hi> was Attainted and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Unheard, and such Councel usually
falls upon those that Councell'd it.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Rob. How.</speaker>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> saith,
<hi>That he doth not withdraw from your Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
but fear of Tumults;</hi> but that Reason
any Man may give for his flying, if it
will be an excuse; but he might have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
himself from Tumults by rendring
himself, and his Innocency upon his Tryal
would have cleared him. This at last may
come to a free Conference, then you may
be left to go along with the King; the
House riseth and doth nothing, and then
the World will see that this Business will
assure the King of <hi>France,</hi> That he hath
a Man with him so Great, as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us from doing any Thing against
him: Therefore as you ought to do
something against him, see whether it
may not be done by the Bill by resuming
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95134:69"/>
his Lands, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> if he come not in by a
Day.</p>
                  <p>An Exception may be against this way,
Namely, That there is no Attainder, but
if there had been such a Bill, the Thing
which should sway me should be the Duke
of <hi>York's</hi> Marriage: So, that if you
Commit this Bill, you may add all Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
except that of Attainder, and if he
come by a Day, then all to be void. If
you go by Proclamation, the Lords may
not Concur and you loose your Ends. By
this Bill all favour that he can expect is
shewed, and this way will be the best
Confutation of the Lords Reasons; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Commit the Bill.</p>

                  <p>You have proceeded against
this Earl in all ordinary ways, and have
been baffled by the Lords. In <hi>Edward</hi> the
<hi>Third's</hi> Reign, <hi>Adam de Berry</hi> fled, and a
Proclamation went against him, and the
Commons neither did, nor ever were bound
to deliver their Articles till the Party
appeared, and in that Case they delivered
not their Articles till the last Day, when
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95134:70"/>
he not appearing was Convicted. When
you would go by Attainder, they tell you,
Deliver special Matter, and we will Summon
him; when you ask a Proclamation, they tell
you, Deliver special Matter: If you declare
the Matter to the Court, it is upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and all may know it. You have tryed
all ways Legal and Regular, and they will
do you Justice in neither. Now what can
you do? except you and the Lords combine
in Justice together, he must escape, and
if you can be made to differ, he goes away
in a Smoak. If you go to the King for a
Proclamation, you must return to the Lords
for Justice. I am sorry the <hi>Ivey</hi> hath been
so near the <hi>Oak,</hi> that you cannot touch it,
without touching that. There remains a
Bill before you, and in that you are upon
equal Terms with the Lords; therefore
give him a Day to be Heard, and if he
come, let him, but then his Penalties are
too low for his Crimes; therefore read
the Bill, go higher, degrade him of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
Forfeit his Lands, and whether you
will go so far, I leave with you.</p>
               </sp>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Soll. Gene.</speaker>
                  <p>It is not possible to agree
with the Lords in their Reasons, but the
Reason must be because the Bill is good.
But if any Man thinks it is good upon the
Lords Reasons he is mistaken; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Advice is to proceed upon the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95134:70"/>
Bill, tho' not upon the Reasons from the
Lords. Some think the Punishment in the
Bill too little for the Crime, others too
much, because not Summon'd; so that it
must fall out, That a Person Impeached
by the <hi>House of Commons</hi> must see the <hi>House</hi>
rise without any marks of displeasure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him: Can any Man be Heard, who will
not be Heard? Why should not you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in such a way against him, as whose
very Flight amounts to a Confession? And
have you not burnt his Paper for refie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
upon the <hi>House?</hi> and can you think he
will appear who is departed in despair of
the Court? and now you are contending to
give him time.</p>
                  <p>Then consider the Thing in it self. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the King had a mind to Attaint him,
the King can do it without your help, for
he may be <hi>Outlawed</hi> for High-Treason; for
tho' that be Reversable at Common-Law,
if he be beyond Sea, yet by two express
Acts of Parliament it is otherwise, but
the King cannot Banish him without your
Concurrence: Suppose him Fled and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted,
so that the Question is not upon
his Life, but his Estate, suppose your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
satisfied in that, is it not past all
manner of Consideration that the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
upon Application restore it? So, that
all you lookt for by Attainder, is done
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95134:71"/>
by this Bill of Banishment, for his Life is
saved by Flight, as would his Estate by
Compassion; but there is something in this
Bill, which, without it, you can never get,
that is, you put him under your Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
which, the King cannot Pardon; and
and will you have it thought abroad, that
the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> fled as he is, hath
been something too hard for the Two
<hi>Houses?</hi>

                  <p>If there be a necessity of
differing with the Lords, and I thought
the difference would produce such Effects,
I should not speak, but they only tell
you 'tis unnecessary and ineffectnal. You
have Impeached, and are now told if you
proceed, it will make difference; but I
fear another greater Danger than this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
The World will say you were
willing he should fly, because you could
not prove by flying he hath Forfeited his
Estate; if the King give it him again it is
his Mercy; but do you Justice: Therefore
press for a Proclamation, for the Bill is
inconsistent with your Honour.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Vaugh.</speaker>
                  <p>I have listned with much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to this Discourse, and understand
it as little now as at the beginning, the
Discourse being nothing adequate to that
end. You have Reasons from the Lords
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95134:71"/>
why They agree not with you, and if you
agree with the Reasons, the Summ is to
read the Bill; but if you agree not, you
must desire a Conference, and if they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
you may have a Proclamation, if not
(as I think they will not) you are where
you were: We suppose him not to be in
<hi>England,</hi> and if so, what is the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
more than the King's Writ? it
reacheth no Man out of the Kingdom. Its
true, in some Cases, if the Persons are
gone out of the Land they are Summon'd,
and if they come not, their Lands are Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
but it is not by Proclamation, which
signifies nothing if the Party be gone.</p>
                  <p>Then go on, suppose the Lords Joyn
in desiring a Proclamation, the end of
which is Appearing and Apprehending,
possibly you gain one part, that if he be
apprehended, they do Imprison him upon
a general Impeachment; but if they agree
not, what benefit have you by it? None:
But if he appears, to what is it? there is
no Charge, if apprehended, to Answer the
general Charge.</p>
                  <p>Then the Third way is, if the Lords
agree not, that you should go to the King,
and there is a more dangerous Rock in
that, than in any thing; for we never heard
of a Commitment <hi>per ipsum Dominum Regem,</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:95134:72"/>
but <hi>per mandatum Domini Regis,</hi> because
against the King lies no Damages: What
then must you do? many think it injustice
to proceed, if he be not called by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.
But it is plain, if you proceed
upon this Bill, you go not upon your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,
but because he is fled from the
Justice of the Land, wherewith you have
Charged him in burning his Paper; and it
imports little, that he saith he is Innocent;
for why then doth he fly? Shall we abate
him of what he ought to suffer for his
saying so? He is fled from the Justice of
the Parliament, and therefore is proceeded
with, and for what others say, you ought
not to regard popular Reasons, but to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
your own; it is enough for you to
hear some Proofs made: When was it
known in any Court, that Proofs should
be taken only on one side? So that you
cannot acquit your own Justice, nor bring
him any ways to Answer, he being gone,
nor can you have any effect of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
tho' the Lords join in it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unless you will have nothing done
after all this, (for he may not be Guilty of
all Charged, who yet hath made himself
Guilty of what is Charged by flying) Read
the Bill.</p>

the Question is mistaken, the Bill is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon his Flight after his Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

if none, it is the safest Argument for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man to run away, and then there is
nothing to catch him. A Proclamation to

more severe than in them, Namely,
that none shall Correspond with him,

OF
HIGH-TREASON,
And other Heinous
MISDEMEANOURS:
Exhibited against Edward Earl
of Clarendon, Lord High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chancellour
of England, in the
House of Lords; on the Ioth
of Iuly, 1663. By the Earl
of Bristol.</head>
            <p>1. THAT being in Place of highess
Trust and Confidence with
His Majesty, and having ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
a Supream Direction
in all His Majesty's Affairs, both at Home
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95134:76"/>
and Abroad, hath Wickedly, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously,
and with a Traiterous Intent
to draw Scandal and Contempt upon His
Majesty's Person, and to alienate from
him the Affections of his Subjects abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the said Trust in manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he hath Traiterously and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
endeavoured to Alienate the Hearts
of His Hajesty's Subjects from him by
words of his own, and by artificial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations
of his Creatures and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances,
that His Majesty was inclined
to <hi>Popery,</hi> and had a Design to alter the
Religion Established in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That in pursuance of that Traiterous
Intent, he hath to several Persons of
His Majesty's <hi>Privy-Council,</hi> held Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That His Majesty was dangerously cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in his Religion, and inclined to
<hi>Propery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Persons of that Religion had
such Access, and such Credit with him,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95134:76"/>
that unless there were a careful Eye
had unto it, the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi>
would be overthrown in this Kingdom;
and in pursuance of the said Wicked and
Traiterous Intent, upon His Majesty's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Sir <hi>Henry Bennet</hi> to be Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> in the Place of
Mr. Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> he hath said
these words, or words to this effect.</p>
            <p>That His Majesty had given 10000l.
to remove a zealous <hi>Protestant,</hi> that he
might bring into that Place of High
Trust a concealed <hi>Papist,</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that the said Sir <hi>Henry Bennet</hi> is
known to have ever been both in his
Profession and Practice constant to the
<hi>Protestant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in pursuance of the same Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Design, several near Friends and
known Dependances of his, have said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,
that were it not for my Lord
<hi>Chancellours</hi> standing in the Gap, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
would be introduced in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or words to that effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:95134:77"/>
That in pursuance of the aforesaid
Traiterous Design, he hath not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
and perswaded the King to do such
things contrary to his own Reasons and
Resolutions as might confirm and encrease
the Scandal, which he had endeavoured
to raise upon His Majesty as aforesaid,
of his favour to <hi>Popery,</hi> but more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to allow his Name to be used to
the Pope and several Cardinals in the
sollicitation of a Cardinals Cap for the
Lord <hi>Aubigney,</hi> one of his own Subjects,
and great <hi>Almoner</hi> at present to his Royal
Consort the Queen.</p>
            <p>That in pursuance of the same Wicked
and Traiterous Design, he had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to be employed to the Pope one of
his own Domesticks, Mr. <hi>Rich. Bealing,</hi> a
Person (tho an avow'd <hi>Papist)</hi> known
to be trusted and employed by him in
Dispatches and Negotiations concerning
Affairs of greatest Concernment to the
Nation.</p>
            <p>That in pursuance of the said Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Design, he being chief Minister of
State, did himself write by the said
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95134:77"/>
Mr. <hi>Rich. Bealing</hi> Letters to several
Cardinals, pressing them in the King's
Name to induce the Pope to Confer a
Cardinals Cap on the said Lord <hi>Aubig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
promising, in Case it should be attained,
exemption to the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> in force
against them; by which Address unto
the Pope for that Ecclesiastical Dignity
for one of His Majesty's Subjects and
Domesticks, he hath, as far as from one
Action can be inferred, traiterously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the Popes Ecclesiastical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
contrary to the known Laws
of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That in pursuance of the same trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Design, he has called unto him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Priests and Iesuits, whom be knew
to be Superiors, of Orders here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and desired them to write to their
Generals at <hi>Rome,</hi> to give their help
for the obtaining from the Pope the
Cardinals Cap for the Lord <hi>Aubigny,</hi>
as aforesaid, promising great Favour to
<hi>Papists</hi> here, in Case it should be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:95134:78"/>
That he hath promised to several <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
he would do his endeavour, and
said he hoped, to compass the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all <hi>Penal Laws</hi> against them, which
he did in pursuance of the traiterous
Design aforesaid; to the end they might
presume and grow vain upon his Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
and by their publishing their hopes
of a Tolleration, encrease the Scandal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
by him, and by his Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to be raised upon His Majesty through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That in pursuance of the same traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Design, being intrusted with the
Treaty betwixt His Majesty, and His
Royal Consort the Queen, be concluded
it upon Articles scandalous and dangerous
to the <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in pursuance of the same traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Design, he concluded the same Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and brought the King and Queen
together, without any settled Agreement
in what manner the Rights of Marriage
should be performed, whereby the Queen
refusing to be married by a Protestant
Priest, in case of her being with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95134:78"/>
Child, either the Succession should be
made uncertain for want of the due
Rights of Matrimony, or else His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to be exposed to a suspition of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been married in his own Dominions
by a <hi>Romish Priest,</hi> whereby all the
former Scandals endeavoured to be raised
upon His Majesty by the said Earl, as
to point of <hi>Popery</hi> might be confirmed
and heightned.</p>
            <p>That having thus traiterously endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to Alienate the Affections of His
Majesty's Subjects from him upon the score
of <hi>Religion,</hi> he hath endeavoured to
make use of all the malicious Scandals
and Iealousies, which he and his Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
had raised in His Majesty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to raise from them unto himself
the popular Applause of being the zealous
Vpholder of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi>
and a promoter of new Severities against
<hi>Papists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he hath traiterously endeavoured
to Alienate the Affections of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
Subjects from him, by venting in
his own Discourse, and by the Speeches
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95134:79"/>
of his nearest Relations and Emissaries,
opprobrious Scandals against His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
Person and course of Life, such as
are not fit to be mentioned, unless ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
in the way of Proof shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it.</p>
            <p>That he hath traiterously endeavoured
to Alienate the Affections of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
by suggesting unto him Iealousies
as far as in him lay, and publishing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
by his Emissaries, that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
intended to Legitimate the D. of
<hi>Monmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he hath Wickedly and Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
contrary to the Duty of a Privy-Councellour
of <hi>England,</hi> and contrary to
the perpetual and most important Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of this Nation, perswaded His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
against the Advice of the Lord
<hi>General</hi> to withdraw the <hi>English</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to demolish
all the Forts built there, at so vast a
Charge to this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:95134:79"/>
That His Majesty having been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
pleased to communicate the Desires
of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the
remove of the laid Garrisons to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England,</hi> and to act their
Advice therein, the said Earl of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon,</hi>
not only perswaded His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
actually to remove those Garrisons,
without expecting the Advice of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England</hi> concerning it, but
did by Menaces of His Majasty's displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
deter several Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from moving the House, as they
intended, to enter upon consideration of
that Matter.</p>
            <p>That he had Traiterously and Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
endeavoured to Alienate His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
Affections and Esteem from this
his Parliament, by telling His Majesty
that there was never so weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
a House of Lords, nor never
so weak and so heady a House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
or words to that effect, and
particularly, that it was better to sell
<hi>Dunkirk,</hi> than to be at their Mercy for
want of Money, or words to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:95134:80"/>
That he hath Wickedly and Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
contrary to his Duty of Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and to a known Law made last
Sessions, by which Money was given, and
particularly applyed for the maintaining
of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> advised and effected the
Sale of the same to the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>That he hath contrary to Law, enriched
himself and his Treasures by the Sale of
Offices.</p>
            <p>That contrary to his Duty he hath
wickedly and corruptly Converted to his
own use, great and vast Summs of publick
Money raised in <hi>Ireland</hi> by way of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy,
private and publick Benevolences,
and otherwise, given and intended to
desray the Charge of Government in that
Kingdom. By which means a supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary
and disaffected Army hath been
kept up there, for want of Money to
pay them off, occasioned it seems to be
because of the late and present Distempers
of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That having arrogated to himself a
supream Direction of all His Majesty's
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95134:80"/>
Affairs, be hath, with a malicious and
corrupt Intention, prevailed to have
His Majesty's Customs Farmed at a far
lower Rate than others do offer, and that
by Persons, with some of whom he goes
a share in, that, and other parts of
Money resulting from His Majesty's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</p>

            <head>The Earl of Bristol having Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
against the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,
Articles of High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Treason,
and other Misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours.
This Order was
made by the House of Peers.</head>
            <head>Die Veneris, 10 July, 1663.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ORDERED,</hi> by the Lords Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and Temporal in Parliament
Assembled, That a Copy of the
Articles or Charge of <hi>High-Treason</hi>
Exhibited this Day by the Earl of
<hi>Bristol,</hi> against the Lord <hi>Chancellour,</hi> be
delivered to the Lord <hi>Chief-Iustice;</hi> who,
with all the rest of the Judges are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whether the said Charge hath been
brought in regularly and legally, and
whether it may be proceeded in, and how,
and whether there be any Treason in it
or no, and make Report thereof to this
House on <hi>Monday</hi> next if they can, or else as
soon after as possibly they may.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, all the Judges met at <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeauts-Inn</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:95134:82"/>
in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Bristol</hi>
repaired to us thither, desiring to see the
Order, which being Read, he told us he
came out of respect to know of us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we were informed how it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>House of Peers,</hi> whether as a Charge
or not; but one of the Judges, who had
been present when it was delivered in,
saying, <hi>we were tied up by our Order,</hi> his
Lordship took some exception at the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his Expression, as if his Lordships
Address was unnecessary at that time,
anb taking it as a rebuke unto him, went
away; but according to our Order, which
supposed it to be a Charge of <hi>High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and not mentioning <hi>Misdemeanour,</hi> we
did upon Consideration unanimously agree
upon this ensuing <hi>Answer,</hi> which on <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
the 13th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Lord <hi>Chief-Iustice
Foster</hi> did deliver in, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We conceive that a Charge of <hi>High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
cannot by the Laws and Statutes of this
Realm be originally Exhibited by one Peer
against another unto the <hi>House of Peers,</hi>
and that therefore a Charge of <hi>High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
by the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> against the Lord
<hi>Chancellour,</hi> mentioned in the Order of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to us of the 10th of this Instant <hi>July,</hi>
hath not been regularly and legally brought
in, and if the Matters alledged in the said
Charge, were admitted to be true, altho' al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be traiterously done, yet there is no
<hi>Treason</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:95134:82"/>
Which <hi>Answer</hi> being given in, the Earl
of <hi>Bristol</hi> took some exceptions at it, and
some of the Lords inferred thence, that
if it were Irregularly and Illegally brought
in, it was a Libel; but we satisfied them
that it was not under Consideration of us,
whether it came in as an Information or
Charge; our Order required us to give
<hi>Answer</hi> to it as a Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We did not meddle with any
thing concerning accusing him of <hi>Misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,</hi>
for our Order reached only to
<hi>Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It did not follow that if this
Charge were Irregular, or Illegal, that
therefore he was Criminal: There might
be Presidents to give Colour to such kind
of Proceedings, for which, till it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
or known that they are Illegal,
they are Titular, and ought not to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
            <p>But it was much insisted on, That we
should deliver the Reason of our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Lord of <hi>Bristol</hi> and his Friends
seeming unsatisfied.</p>
            <p>We <hi>Replyed,</hi> That it was never known,
that when the Justices to whom <hi>Questions</hi>
were referred from Parliament had una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
agreed in their Opinions, that
Reasons were required from them. Yet,
notwithstanding, it being the desire of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95134:83"/>
Lords after some things premised, and
a desire that this should not be drawn
into an Example, (which the Lords as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto as I took it, for no Order
was entred concerning it, there being no
Order as I think for delivering our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
entred) and it was agreed amongst
us, that no Note should be reduced, least
we might be required to deliver our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in writing, nor had I time to digest
it in writing, having only <hi>Monday</hi> Night
after Conference with my Brethren to
think upon it, I did on the next <hi>Tuesday,</hi>
being the 14th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> deliver the Reasons
of all the Judges, of their Opinions, by
their Consents. To the first Point, <hi>That a
Charge of</hi> High-Treason <hi>cannot originally be
Exhibited by one Peer against another unto the
House of Peers,</hi> the Emphasis of the word
<hi>originally</hi> was shewed.</p>
            <p>For <hi>First,</hi> an Indictment of <hi>Treason</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Peer may be removed up to the
Lords House to be tryed, as it was in the
31 <hi>H.</hi> 6. in the Earl of <hi>Devonshir</hi>'s Case,
but a Steward was then to be made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If an Impeachment came from
the <hi>House of Commons</hi> unto the <hi>Lords House,</hi>
we did not take upon us the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether this could be proceeded in
or not, for it was not the Case to which
we were required to give <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:95134:83"/>
We <hi>Replyed,</hi> Upon the Statute 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4.
<hi>Chap.</hi> 14. which recits the many great
Inconveniencies and Mischiefs by Appeals,
and provides that all Appeals of Things
within the Realm, shall be Tryed and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the good Laws of the Realm
made and used in the time of the King's
noble Progenitors, and Appeals of Things
out of the Realm before the Constable
and Marshal: But We relyed upon the
Clause ensuing, and thereupon it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and assented, That no Appeals be
from thenceforth made, or in any wise
pursued in Parliament in time to come.
I shewed Appeals in this Statute, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
by single Persons were one and
the same Thing, and that this Statute
reached to all Appeals, Charges, Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Impeachments delivered in, in
Parliament, whereupon the Person Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
was to be put to his <hi>Answer,</hi> and
that they were but several Names of the
same Thing, I shewed first Historically, that
the Appeals the 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2.
were but Accusations by those Lords of
Felons against the other, and differed from
the Case of the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> and
<hi>Norfolk,</hi> which was to be tryed as 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2.
<hi>Pl. Cor.</hi> in <hi>Parl. No.</hi> 19. is by the Course
of the Civil Law, and thereupon Batle
was waged. That tho' it concerned <hi>H.</hi> 4.
in Interest to confirm the 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95134:84"/>
Repell the 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. he being Appellant
in the former, yet he saw the Mischief
so great, that he himself made Provision
against them for the time to come; and
indeed, the Mischief was so great, that
it ceased not after the destruction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Lords and Families (there being <hi>lex
talionis</hi> in that 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. used towards most
of those Appellants in the 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2.) till
it tumbled King <hi>R.</hi> 2. First out of his
Throne, and then into his Grave.</p>
            <p>That there were but two sorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in <hi>Capitalibus,</hi> the Suit of the
Party which was called an Appeal, or the
Suit of the King, who ought to proceed
by Indictment, and so to Tryal by vertue
of <hi>Magna Charta. Nec super eam ibimus,</hi>
&amp;c. and that, in an Appeal, being the
Suit of the Party, there was no Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of appearance if it were an Appeal
at the Common-Law, 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. Lord
<hi>Gray</hi>'s Case. That an Appeal was taken in
our Law-Books frequently for an accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Party, I scited <hi>Westm.</hi> the
<hi>1st, Cap.</hi> 14. where the words Appeal
reaches to Indictment. And 9 <hi>Cook,</hi> 119.
Lord <hi>Zanchar</hi>'s Case, that an Appeal of
two significations, one general and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in our Books for an Accusation,
and <hi>Stamford,</hi> 142. In Case of an Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the Felon after Confession may Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
that is, (saith he) accuse others, Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutors
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95134:84"/>
with him to do the Felony. <hi>C. C.</hi> 189.
Appellant, cometh from the <hi>French</hi> word
<hi>Appeller,</hi> which signifies to <hi>accuse,</hi> or <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach,</hi>
and <hi>C. C.</hi> 287. Appel signifieth an
<hi>Accusation;</hi> and therefore to Appeal a
Man is as much as to accuse, and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Books he that doth Appeal a Man
is called <hi>accusator, vide</hi> 9 Ed. 2. <hi>Articuli
Cleri, Cap.</hi> 16. That I knew no reason
why in those tumbling Times of <hi>R.</hi> 2.
(which caused this Statute, for the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Roll
is <hi>comant ad autermant este us
en temps la darren Roy,</hi> R. 2.) They should
proceed by way of Appeal, but because
they were then allowed at the Suit of
the Party, to accuse any other of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
but at the King's Suit there ought to
be an indictment, and an Indictment could
not be found but by Jury.</p>
            <p>That in all other Cases, an Appeal was
to be brought by the Party concerned, the
Wife or Heir, or Party Robbed, &amp;c. But
in Case of <hi>Treason,</hi> any Man may Appeal
another, and therefore in all reason it
must be understood of an Accusation, and
any Man might accuse another of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
and if it can be proved by Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
it must not be Tryed by Battle, as
other Appeals may. I concluded that the
8 <hi>H. 6. No.</hi> 38. this Statute, the 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4.
<hi>Cap.</hi> 14. is recited, and desired it should
be duely kept and put in Execution, which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95134:85"/>
was granted, that <hi>Stamford</hi> 78. See <hi>Pl.
Cor.</hi> 31. 132. agree that Appeals of <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Treasons</hi>
were not commonly used to be
Sued in Parliament, till the 1 <hi>H. 4. Cap.</hi>
14. Since which time this manner of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
hath gone out of use; and I said, I
had searched many Presidents, and tho'
of late, there may be a President (as it
was of the Earl of <hi>Bristols</hi> Father against
the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> of some kind of
Impeachment) yet I did confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there was not since that Statute,
1 <hi>H. 4. Cap.</hi> 14. any one President of such
an Impeachment at the Party-Suit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
there was any Indictment: In truth
in the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi>'s Case, the <hi>Commons</hi>'s
<hi>House</hi> did Impeach the Duke of <hi>Treason,</hi>
and so the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi>'s Impeachment
proceeded not.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Seeond</hi> Point, <hi>That there was
no</hi> Treason <hi>in the Charge, tho' the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in it are alledged to be Traiterously
done.</hi> I said we had perused each Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<hi>Seriatim,</hi> and we had found no <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
in them, the great Charge, which is
endeavoured to be proved by many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
was, <hi>That he did Traiterously,
and Maliciously, to bring the King into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and with an intent to Alien the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Affections from him,</hi> say, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such and
such <hi>words,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:95134:85"/>
And so it runs on, That in pursuance
of the <hi>Traiterous Intent,</hi> &amp;c. he did, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and that in farther pursuance of the said
<hi>Traiterous Design,</hi> &amp;c. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was most of the Articels upon which
the Characters of <hi>Treason</hi> seemed to be
fixed. I said that it is a transcendant
Misprision or offence to endeavour to bring
the King into Contempt, or to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Alienate the Peoples Affections from
him, but yet it was not <hi>Treason.</hi> This
Statute, 13 <hi>Car. 2. Cap.</hi> 1. makes <hi>Treason</hi>
during the King's Life: But if a Man
calls the King <hi>Heretick,</hi> or <hi>Papist,</hi> or that
he endeavours to introduce <hi>Popery,</hi> (which
is more in express Terms than the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of that kind insinuates) or by Words,
Preaching, Prayer, to stir up the People
to hatred or dislike of the Person of His
Majesty, or the Established Government;
the Penalty is only Disability to enjoy
any Place Ecclesiastical, Civil, or Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and subject to such Penalties as by
the Common-Law or Statute of this Realm
may be inflicted in such Case, (which is
Fine and Ransom, with Imprisonment)
and it limits a time and manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</p>
            <p>There was an <hi>Objection</hi> made yesterday
upon the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. That this being in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
the King and Parliament had
Power to declare <hi>Treason,</hi> and then we
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95134:86"/>
ought to have delivered our Opinions
with a qualification, unless it be declared
<hi>Treason</hi> by Parliament where this Charge
is depending; to this I <hi>Answer'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. 'Tis not <hi>Treason</hi> in praesenti, and if
such a Declaration should be <hi>non constat,</hi>
whether it would relate to the time
past?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That I conceived that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
as touching that <hi>Declaratory Power,</hi>
extended but to such Cases as were clearly
<hi>Felony,</hi> as Single Acts, if not <hi>Treason.</hi> (the
words being) <hi>Whether it be Treason or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Felony;</hi> but in respect of the doubts
of <hi>Escheats,</hi> which, if <hi>Treason,</hi> belonged to
the King, if <hi>Felony,</hi> to the Lords of the
<hi>fee,</hi> it was left to the Parliament. I did
not say we Resolved the Point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That admitting the <hi>Declarato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Power</hi> did extend to other Cases than
such as were before the Judges, and was
not taken away by 1 <hi>M. Cap.</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Statute, yet I read my Lord <hi>Cooks</hi>
Opinion at large, <hi>Pl. Cor. Fol.</hi> 22. That
this Declaration must be by the King,
Lords and Commons, and by any two of
them alone; and we were now in a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
way before the <hi>House of Peers</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and I did affirm as clear Law, that
by this judicial way no <hi>Treason</hi> could be
declared nor adjudged, but as were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
within the Letter of the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
and said, That Statute 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. was a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95134:86"/>
second <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and that their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
thought it their greatest Security
to narrow, and not to enlarge <hi>Treason,</hi>
and Cited 1 <hi>H. 4. Cap.</hi> 10. to which in the
Parliament Roll is added <hi>Rot. No.</hi> 17. (it
coming of the King's Free-grace) That the
Lords did much rejoyce and humbly thank
the King: And I read the Statute 1 <hi>M.
Cap.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>That the now Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> in my
Lord of <hi>Sraffords</hi> Case, was the great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertor
of the Law against Constructive
and Accumulativë <hi>Treason,</hi> which if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
their Lordships could better sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
unto themselves, than I exprest, how
great a Door they would let open to
other Inconveniencies and Mischiefs to the
Peerage. I concluded with reading the
Act, 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. for Reversing the Attainder
of the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> the first part
whereof I read to them, wherein is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
That they who Condemned him,
did purposely make an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Condemn him upon an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative
<hi>Treason,</hi> none of the pretended
Crimes being <hi>Treason</hi> a-part, and so
could not be in the whole, if they had
been proved.</p>
            <p>After I had spoken to this effect, the
Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> seemed to acquiesce, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as concerned our Opinions as the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95134:87"/>
Case was delivered to us, but it being to
be put to the <hi>Question,</hi> whether the Lords
did Concur with the Judges Opinions,
and himself being concerned in the Illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
that therefore the Charge was Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
and Irregular; yet not being inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by him, as he said, as a Charge, but
an Information he desired (tho' as the
Case was put to us, it was a good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference)
that the Voting of that might
be spared till it was <hi>Resolved</hi> by the Lords
whether he delivered it in as a Charge,
or only as an Information for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Charge if it should be thought
fit for their Lordships to proceed in it:
After some Debate upon the <hi>Question,</hi> the
Lords <hi>Resolved</hi> the same Day according
to our Opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That a Charge of <hi>High-Treason</hi>
cannot by the Laws and Statutes of this
Realm be originally Exhibited by one
Peer against another, unto the <hi>House of
Peers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in these Articles, if the
Matters alledged in them were admitted
to be true, there is no <hi>Treason</hi> in them,
and because the Lords unanimously Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
in them, (my Lord of <hi>Bristol.</hi>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> any other) it was by order
entred, that these Votes were <hi>Nemine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:95134:87"/>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That in Judge <hi>Hattons</hi> Reports,
<hi>Fol.</hi> the Resolution of the Judges is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
to be, That a Peer cannot be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
but by Indictment, and Mr. <hi>Rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
in his Collections, <hi>Fol.</hi> 272. expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
such an Opinion to be delivered by
the Judges in 1 or 2 <hi>Car.</hi> but upon search
it was found to be entred in the Journal
of Parliament of that time, but it was
cautions referring to the Common-Law
only. But that, for Proceedings in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,
did not belong to them to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
or to that effect; but no mention
of 1 <hi>H. 4. Cap.</hi> 14. It hath been credibly
reported that some of the Judges in my
Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Case, being asked some
Questions, did with the like Caution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
their Opinions, and did speak with
Reservaions, (as the Case is put) tho'
they upon Hearing, did know the Case mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put;
which, after, troubled the Conscience
of one of them, (<hi>ut audivi</hi>) being a
grave learned Man. <hi>Vide Peacocks</hi> Case,
<hi>Cook Fol.</hi> But we, having the Case referred
to us in Parliament upon Articles Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
in Parliament, did <hi>Resolve</hi> to deliver
our Opinions without any such Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and the Act of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. being exprest
against Appeals in Parliament, (and of
Acts of Parliaments after they are once
made, none under the King, and without
him are Interpreters but the Judges. <hi>See
Kings Answer Printed, in the old Print of</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:95134:88"/>
3 Car. 3. <hi>at the end of the Petition.</hi>) And
therefore did deliver these Opinions which
I conceive of great Benefit to the Lords
themselves, and a just ground for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enquiry to be made, whether such
Impeachments may be in the <hi>House of
Peers</hi> for other <hi>Misdemeanours,</hi> without the
King's leave, or being Exhibited by his
Attorney.</p>
            <p>And secondly to take into Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Validity of Impeachments of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
by the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the late Presidents which yet ended
in a Bill, and so in the Legislative, not
Judiciary Way.</p>
