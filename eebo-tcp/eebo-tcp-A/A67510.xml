            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I had several Reasons that induc'd me to put this Title to my Book; and not to keep you longer upon the Fret, I will tell you some of them. <hi>First,</hi> The natural inquisitive Humour that reigns in all Mankind after Novelty; for no sooner will the Title be Read, or Cry'd, but the Reader, or Hearer, will query what it's about, conclude it some Maggot or other, and to be satisfi'd, will Buy it; so you'll gain by his Curiosity. Then I've known many dull Books that have sold well, by the help of an Ingenious, or Whimsical Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. <hi>Puffe me, Puffe mo, Puffe cannot stay, Colle molle Puff</hi>; the Odness and Maggot of that Cry, has sold the Fellow many a Tart; for many Persons who only out of Curiosity have peep'd into his Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, have found something or other that pleas'd them. Besides the Title is a <hi>pro po,</hi> because the Subjects I write about, tho' they make a great bustle in the World, yet their Conclusions, or Produce, are very Frivolous, Insignificant, and answer not the End design'd.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION.</head>
               <p>The Answer I make, to those that will say, Every Body knew this Story before, is, That tho' I pretend to Write Novel's, I don't No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, but to dress up something that for one Meal may be Pleasing, and of grateful Gust; and perhaps some Observation may be made from this Story worthy Self-Application: But tho' the Reader do not, I will, to continue the Method I first Design'd.</p>
               <p>To Attempt any thing, which nothing but (almost) a Miracle can make Successful, is Folly and Madness; and little less, can move a Man of Threescore Years and Ten to do—to any purpose. An Old Man Marrying a Young Woman, is like laying down a good Joynt of Meat, to an almost Consumed Fire, which will blaze a while, but by the sudden decay, for want of Fuel, will make it but luke Warm:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35328:6"/>
He is counted a Blockhead that pretends to set up a Trade, when he is past Labour, without he takes an able Journeyman; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in this Case, no Man will willingly admit of a Journeyman to manage his Commodity, and without one (by effects may be judg'd) the Marriage will signifie little towards Procreation. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments must happen to the Man from Natural Consequence, notwithstanding the mighty belief of his Abilities. I have known from Powerful Fancy, when a Child has been tyred with Walking, yet Imagining he Rode when he had a Switch between his Legs, would Imitate the Trot and Gallop, for a small while, without complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but presently the weakness and Imbecility of his Feet, made him sensible his Natural Strength (tho' agitated by Desire) could not carry him to his desired home: So the Old, whose Vigorous heat is Spent, may imagine if he get a Cock Horse, how furiously he'll Ride; but like the tyred Child, his Natural decay will appear.</p>
               <p>The Man being deceived, by Consequence the Woman must; and what sad Effects do such Disappointments cause, are Evident from the future carriage of both Man and Woman: He grows Jealous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing another should Feed, tho' he himself can't make use of the Dainties; then the Poor abused Woman is watch'd, perhaps confin'd, and her whole Life made uneasie.</p>

The <hi>Libertinism</hi> of an <hi>Heathen,</hi> I don't so much wonder at, because he has no Thoughts of Futurity to Check his Mad Career; but that Men who are dayly Taught, and Instructed in Piety, and Morality, and who upon a Self-query, will own that they really Believe to do Good, is for their Advantage, should Act directly contrary to their Belief, is an Extravagant Madness, not to be parallell'd: Is there no Remedy for so Great, and Contagious an Evil to be found? Yes, an <hi>Heathen</hi> teaches me one, <hi>Trabimur Exemplis Plus Quam Praeceptis</hi>; for if those in Power and Greatness Practised Vertue, the Underlings would Imitate; if 'twere Customary, every one would be in the Fashion: But whilst Vice and Immorality are Countenanc'd by the Great, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for keeping the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and against Prophanness, are of little Efficacy; for when the great Fish break the Net, the little ones will go out at the Rent.

               <p>THIS Story is equally applicable to <hi>Iacobite, Williamite, Wigg, Tory,</hi> or what other Name of Distinction is given to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man, who Rows not with the common Stream that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of his Country runs; he tugs against the Tide, and makes very little Progress. To oppose the General Sentiments of a Country, is drawing up-hill by choice, and gives just cause for People to call a Man's Judgment in Question, since there is a nearer, and down-hill beaten Path at Hand; 'tis something like going in the <hi>Strand,</hi> towards the Horse-Guard, on a <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Evening, when one has the trouble of meeting the Current of the City Gentry, going from the <hi>Park</hi>; he that complies not to the Practice of a Nation,, appears like one in a Sad-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Coat, bearing Arms amongst the Guard at <hi>White-hall,</hi> he is star'd at; and if observ'd by a Superior, will be Punished.</p>

Parallel Examples ought to be search'd for, and the method of Proceedings, that have been commonly taken by others, approv'd by future Allowance to have been Just, and fitting to be done, ought to Guide, and mightily Sway me to concord to such approv'd Precedents; for if a Man disagrees out of a particular Opinion, or Interest, he, as far as in him lyes, calls the discretion of a great many in Question, and battles a number with his opiniated Reason, from such Proceeding, one can expect no Benefit, or Reputation.

At first view he thought this Paper as a Pillow of Light to guide him in the Dark: But upon examining the Inquiries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Places and Imploys, and those that wanted Agents, found they answer'd one another's Occasions, and that there was not one Agent enquired after, but there was the same Place sought for; so he dispair'd of Success from that, seeing every one's Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion might be supplied.</p>
            <p>Though his Sleep, or rather Slumbers, was unquiet and short, occasioned by the concern that hagg'd his Thoughts about his future earthly well Being, yet his lying Awake was more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting to him, as much as Impending want had then a more lively Impression, than his drowsy Fancy could Represent; so trying, as if it were to avoid himself, he arose, slighting Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Formality, soon dress'd himself, and went to <hi>Man</hi>'s Coffee-house, where, though 'twas early in the Morning, he found Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative <hi>Will,</hi> a tall elderly Man, with his own Hair, diverting the Company, sometimes in <hi>English,</hi> sometimes in <hi>French</hi>; in both Languages he told Stories as improbable to be true as all D. <hi>O</hi>'s Narrative. He took upon him the States-man, and told the Company he knew of Funds that would have rais'd Money e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to defray the Charge of the War, without being any pressure to the Subject: He blam'd all that he was pleas'd to think Mismanagement in the Concerns of the Nation; and then gravely told them, how all might have been prevented, which every Block-head can do, after the Act is past; and, for the future how he would have things managed; but Mercy upon us if Affairs were to be ordered by his Managery, (looking upon his own Conduct) it may reasonably be believed, they would have been Ten times worse directed.
