            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter it was determined amongſt the ſhepheardeſſes of <hi>Lignon,</hi> to go
all together within three dayes upon a viſit unto the diſguiſed
<hi>Alexis;</hi> Love, whoſe cuſtome is to torment thoſe moſt, who are
moſt devoted unto it, began to make the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
ſenſible of ſuch odd panges of ſtrange impatiencies, that ſhe could
not give any good account of reaſon for them. She found in her
ſelfe ſuch a violent deſire of ſeeing <hi>Alexis,</hi> becauſe every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
her ſo reſemblant unto <hi>Celadon;</hi> that the prejudicated
mind of this ſage ſhepheardeſſe, was fully reſolved to love her before yet ſhe ever ſaw her;
or rather, this foreſtalled reſolution was a forerunner of a moſt great and impatient
love: ſo as it may be ſaid, that this new love was implanted in her very Nature, ſince it
produced in her, all the conſequences and effects which love uſeth in the ſoul of a zealous
lover: ſo as three dayes which were to be expired before they went this long deſired viſit,
ſeemed unto her three long and tedious yeares: And ſhe would with all her heart have
been contented to abate ſo many yeares of her life, upon condition theſe three dayes were
done, that ſhe might injoy her hop't for contentment: But when <hi>Alexis</hi> underſtood by
her Brother, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was to come to ſee her very ſhortly, oh how this diſguiſed
<hi>Dru de</hi> ſtarted at the newes? ſhe reſented two different Paſſions at once; ſhe was highly
joyed, to thinke that ſhe was to be bleſſed with a ſight, of her dearly loved ſhepheardeſſe,
and to talke with her in that diſguiſe: Alſo ſhe was damped with a pale feare, when ſhe
conſidered that her Miſtreſſe had reaſon to accuſe her of diſobedience, &amp; ſinning againſt her
poſitive commands; a Crime which was death it ſelfe unto her to commit; for having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
that time preſerved her affections pure and free from all manner of blame, ſhe would
much rather chuſe death, then ſuffer it to be ſtained with the leaſt blur of infidelity or
want of reſpect: but, as all true Lovers uſe, her thoughts harped more upon the pleaſing
ſtring of her hopes, then upon that which her feares ſuggeſted; ſo as ſhe begun to thinke
this terme of three dayes a long while too, and to be angry with thoſe that took ſo long a
term.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leonide</hi> who knew all the ſecrets of her heart, and who ſeemed to be deſtined never to
enjoy what ſhe deſired, but to contribute all her endeavours and induſtry towards the
contentment of another; had not ſhe, I ſay, ſweetned theſe tedious dayes by her affability
and complaiſance, doubtleſſe the time had been moſt irkſome unto her. But ſee what a
bad maſter love is, and how ill does he recompenſe the paines of thoſe that ſerve him; He
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53527:4"/>
did injoyn theſe two Lovers with abundance of mutuall affection unto one another, but
as if he were unwilling they ſhould arrive at the ſum of contentment, he kept them igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of their happineſſe, and by this ignorance blaſted their contentment. For <hi>Celadon</hi>
being condemned unto perpetuall baniſhment, he laid the fault upon the change in his
ſhepheardeſſes affection: And <hi>Aſtrea</hi> having ſeen <hi>Celadon</hi> throw himſelfe into the River
of <hi>Lignon,</hi> ſhe thought, that this ſhepheards love not being able to endure the cruelty of
her command he had choſen death before the inſupportable ſentence of her anger; and
this conſideration coſt her abundance of bitter repentance, many a ſad ſigh, and a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
of Teares. This impatiently expected day drawing nigh, and being earneſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
both by this new <hi>Druide,</hi> and by the new love of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> both of them not being able
to ſtay ſo long as till the Sunne was up, they quitted their beds upon the firſt bluſh of
Aurora. <hi>Celadon,</hi> as moſt vigilant, called the Sun ſluggard, and conjured Aurora to open
the windowes of Heaven quickly, that thereby this happy and long'd for day might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a beginning. Whilſt this reſtleſſe ſhepheard was in this longing expectation, and
condemning the Suns ſlow motion, day did by degrees enlighten his Chamber; ſo as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
<hi>Druids</hi> habit, he left the Name of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and in lieu of it aſſumed the Notion
of Daughter unto <hi>Adamas;</hi> happy had he been, could he have left off his Paſſion as he
did his habit; but <hi>Celadons</hi> heart was ſtill the ſame in any diſguiſe, and nothing could
work a change in it but death.</p>
                  <p>Being thus clad in the habit of <hi>Alexis,</hi> as ſoon as the doores of the houſe were open,
he walked alone into a little Grove which had the view of the Plaine; and from whence
he could ſee the whole Courſe of the delightfull River of <hi>Lignon:</hi> As ſoon as ever he caſt
his eye that way, it preſently ſtopped at the place where <hi>Aſtrea</hi> dwelt, and thinking upon
the happy dayes which he had ſpent in that place, when in his own habit he was freely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be with his beloved ſhepheardeſſe; Oh what abundance of ſighs did this thought
force from him? He began to recollect into his memory, all the ſweet and kind anſwers
which ever ſhe had given him, when being forced by the violence of his love, he begged
ſome aſſurances of affection from her: Here he reveived the memory of all the traverſes and
thwartings which <hi>Alcipes</hi> and <hi>Hipolite</hi> uſed; he did not forget the averſneſſe of <hi>Alces,</hi>
nor the anger of their Parents, nor his long travels, nor any ſubtiltie which love had taught
him: Alſo he punctually remembred <hi>Aſtreas</hi> conſtancy in all difficulties, nor did he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
any circumſtance, which might be any argument of her love once unto him. Then
preſently after conſidering how the caſe ſtood now, and how ſhe had baniſhed him her
preſence, alſo looking upon that fatal place where he received that diſmall ſentence, Yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(ſaid he, and pointed to the place with his finger) yonder's the place deſtined to
Raviſh from me all my joyes, and to be the beginning of all my miſeries. But (ſaid he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a melancholly pauſe) is it poſſible ſo great affection ſhould ever become ſuch extreame
hatred? Can ſuch firm Conſtancy admit of any Change! And can ſuch perfect happineſſe
be ever turned into ſuch unlook't for diſaſters. Then ſtanding in a mute poſture, admiring
the ſtrange difference between his life paſt, and this preſent: Nay, nay, (ſaid he) never
ſtand wondering at the ſtrangeneſſe of the alteration; but rather wonder, that ſuch a
change ſhould be, and yet <hi>Celadon</hi> ſhould live, ſince he hath loſt all that can make life
ſweet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſtrea</hi> in the mean time, who had not cloſed an eye all the night, no ſooner ſpied the
firſt bluſh of Aurora, but ſhe quitted her Bad, dreſſed her ſelfe with all poſſible haſte, and
went with all diligence to find out her Companions, who being leſſe paſſionate upon the
journey then ſhe, had paſt away the night with leſſe inquietude and more reſt; And
though in her way thither ſhe eſpied <hi>Silvander</hi> in the field of <hi>Mercury,</hi> lying down under
the Pillar, yet leaſt ſhe ſhould loſe time, ſhe would not ſpeak unto him, but haſted away
towards her Companions, whom ſhe imagined to find ſleeping, and whom ſhe intended
to haſten. And indeed ſhe did find them all aſleep, ſhe awaked them, called them ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards,
and to prompt them unto more haſt, pulled the clothes off their beds, and made them
wonder at her forwardneſſe, but the vehemency of her paſſion might plead her excuſe: Oh
<hi>Silvander,</hi> how much beholding hadſt thou been unto this ſhepheardeſſe, had ſhe brought
thee along with her to be witneſſe of this Act, in pulling off the Clothes from them?
Judge what effects ſuch a ſight would have cauſed in thee, ſince <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſeeing thoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in that poſture, was raviſhed with admiration at them, and with a ſigh, ſaid, Ah
<hi>Diana,</hi> had you been the third in the Temple, certainly <hi>Celadon</hi> would have beſtowed
the Apple upon you. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto her) You are this morning in ſuch a mood,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53527:4"/>
as I muſt needs ſuſpect your judgement: And as for matter of beauty, I cannot pretend
unto it: As I was comming hither (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) I ſaw one who I am ſure is of another
opinion; and had you ſeen him as I did in the field of <hi>Mercury,</hi> with folded armes, and
eyes lifted up to heaven, you would have better believed what I ſay. I know (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>)
that you ſpeak of <hi>Silvander:</hi> but ſiſter, I know again that what he does, is but fained,
and upon a wager; Fictions, replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> doe never cauſe reall paſſions; and call me
the moſt ignorant perſon that lives, if <hi>Silvander</hi> doe not moſt paſſionately love you, and
if his affection, treat him as you will, doe not accompany him to his Grave; for melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
perſons who are ſlow and long before they do love, when once the flame is kindled,
it will never be extinguiſht in them. I muſt confeſſe ſiſter (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) that when this
wager firſt began, I had the ſame apprehenſions. And but becauſe you would needs have it
ſo, I ſhould not have conſented unto it, knowing very well how dangerous theſe fictions
are: but ſince the diſeaſe of this ſhepheard proceeds from the permiſſion which you have
obtained for him from me, I am reſolved that this ſhall be the laſt day he ſhall have leave
to continue his Courtſhip; for I will give judgement betweene <hi>Phillis</hi> and him in the
preſence of <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leonide;</hi> the three moneths are determined, and I have deferred
it only out of deſire that the Nymphs might ſee the concluſion of the buſineſſe, as ſhe hath
the beginning. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> being unwilling to diſpleaſe her, was ſilent; but <hi>Phillis</hi> began,
Good ſiſter, ſaid ſhe, doe you think that when your judgement is given, if he doe love
you, he will then ceaſe? I believe (anſwered <hi>Diana</hi>) that he will not then talke to me
as he hath done; and if he doe love me, the trouble of it will be his own. Oh <hi>Diana,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Phillis;</hi> you are miſtaken: for now you may put it off by ſaying, that what he does
is onely to make good his wager; but when this excuſe is taken away, you will be then
obliged to receive his language as in good earneſt. What you ſay, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> is very
true; but let me tell you, that if he give me any language but what is fitting, I ſhall give
him anſwers as ſhall keep him from any replies. Upon this <hi>Phillis</hi> began to laugh; My
deare Companion, ſaid ſhe, we have ſeen ſome put on ſuch reſolutions, who have been
forced to alteration: for tell me, I beſeech you, ſuppoſe he ſhould continue in his addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
after your charge to the contrary, what then? would you kill him for his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
I would not kill him, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> but I will give him ſuch language as if he
did love me, he would feare offending me; and if he did not love me, let him doe what he
will, he will be weary of it quickly. Nay on the contrary, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> If he doe not
love you, he will not care how much he diſpleaſeth you; and if he love you, his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will not let him obey you in any thing which ſhall croſſe his love: for, ſiſter, be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that a violent affection may perhaps be thwarted, but never entirely eradicated.
Perhaps he will for a time obey your ſevere commands, but ere long he will caſt off all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
and like a Torrent which is ſtopped in its courſe, will at laſt overflow its
own banks, and all the fields about it: So I ſay, your forbiddance may for a time be a
ſtoppage unto the ſtream of his violencies; but his affection will at laſt break down all
before it, and overflow all your commands that obſtruct it, and perhaps with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
as every one ſhall ſee it. If it ſhould ſo fall out, as you may very well expect it will,
what can you doe more, but ſtill renew your firſt forbiddances? Perhaps your language
will be more ſharp, but alas, words are but words, and too weak to give a check unto one
that really loves, as I believe <hi>Silvander</hi> does. Siſter (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> faintly) I never yet met
with any ſuch obſtinate Lovers which you ſpeak of; and when I doe, I ſhall find out a
way to be rid from them: Heaven has not made us ſo miſerable, but though they have
denyed us ſtrength, yet have they given us prudence enough to preſerve our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thus theſe faire ſhepheardeſſes diſcourſed while they were dreſſing themſelves; and
when they were ready, they went towards the field of <hi>Mercury,</hi> where they were all to
rendezvous; then to go unto the Temple of the good Goddeſſe, and from thence to
<hi>Alexis. Silvander</hi> was before all the reſt, finding no contentment, but when he ſaw
<hi>Diana.</hi> When they came there, this ſhepheard was ſinging, and was ſo rapt up in his own
imagination, as though they were very near him, yet he perceived them not. <hi>Diana</hi> ſeeing
him in this condition; ſhe knew very well that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> had ſpoken truth, and
that he prepared himſelf for a great Combat with her; who ſince the death of <hi>Philander,</hi>
had never any ſpark of good will unto any man but this ſhepheard but not enduring that
<hi>Silvander</hi> ſhould ſerve her, being a perſon altogether unknown ſhe reſolved upon extream
rigor againſt the affection of this ſhepheard; and perhaps, ſomething againſt her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.
Whilſt ſhe was in theſe thoughts, <hi>Phillis</hi> who loved <hi>Silvander</hi> for cauſing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53527:5"/>
the jealouſie of <hi>Lycidas</hi> to vaniſh. She pittied him, and turning towards <hi>Diana,</hi> whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
thus in her eare; I doe ingeniouſly confeſſe, Miſtriſs, that this ſhepheard does love
you better then I doe, and I am affraid that if you be judge the cauſe will go againſt me.
<hi>Dianas</hi> mind being directed another way, ſhe did not reply, but as ſoon as <hi>Silvander</hi> had
done ſinging; How now ſhepheard, ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> unto him, doe you value this company
ſo little, that you will not daign them a look? <hi>Silvander</hi> being rouſed out of his deep
thoughts, by this voice, as out of a profound ſleep, he ſtarted up, and ſaluted the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes.
I muſt confeſſe (ſaid he) that <hi>Phillis</hi> hath obliged me, though perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to her intention. Your ingratitude, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> is ſuch towards me,
as I ſhall never adviſe any to oblige you, ſince you doe ſo ill acknowledge it; doe you
thanke me thus for advertiſing you of your duty, and for bringing her unto you whom
you ſay you love? methinkes common civility ſhould prompt you unto a more handſome
acknowledgement then this. <hi>Phillis,</hi> anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> you put me in mind of thoſe
Cowes, who when they have filled the Paile with milk, doe throw it downe with their
foot; for when you had in ſome ſort obliged me, you cancell the obligation by upbraiding
me with it. I muſt confeſſe that what you have done does merit acknowledgement, but
what acknowledgement is due? the very ſame that <hi>Diana</hi> uſeth unto her little Dogge
<hi>Driope,</hi> when he hath done any thing which pleaſeth her; and if you aske her, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
ſhe gives him, ſhe will tell you, that ſhe onely chocks him under the chin, and
ſtrokes him half a dozen times upon the back; and ſince you have done no more for me,
methinkes you ſhould be content with the ſame paiment. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> could not
chuſe but laugh at his merry anſwer. Upon which <hi>Silvander</hi> ſtepped towards her, and
offered to ſtroke her as <hi>Diana</hi> did her Dogge; but ſhe puſhed him away, and with a frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
look, ſaid unto him. If you uſe to pay your debts with ſuch money, I believe all your
Creditors will caſt you off as I doe, ſince your payment is ſo bad but, ungrateful perſon,
you cannot deny your Obligation unto me to be great, for changing your melancholly
thoughts into a ſight of the fair <hi>Diana.</hi> This Obligation, ſaid he, I muſt needs confeſſe to
be very great, if it was done intentionally; but it was done with a quite contrary deſigne,
becauſe all that proceeds from an enemy may well be ſuſpected. What ill deſigne could I
have in it, replyed <hi>Phillis?</hi> Perhaps you thought, ſaid he, that the ſeverity of my Miſtreſs
would more perplex me then my melancholly thoughts; or becauſe you know that the
more one ſees the perſon loved, the more is love augmented; you thought there was no
ſpeedier way to kill me, then by the ſight of this faire ſhepheardſſe. But <hi>Phillis,</hi> doe
not think that I will ever ſhrink from ſuch a death, ſince I am ſure I cannot avoid it, and
ſince no life can be more deſireable then ſuch a death is.</p>
                  <p>This diſpute had laſted longer between this ſhepheard and ſhepheardeſſes, had they
not ſeen a company coming towards them, and very neare; all with intentions of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together as viſitants of <hi>Alexis.</hi> One of the company, to make the time ſeem leſſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
did ſing, and the ſubſtance of his ſong was againſt an unconſtant ſhepheardeſſe:
<hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> liſtned with ſilent attention unto the words of the Song: the finger
was preſently known to be <hi>Corilas,</hi> who being ſtung with the perfidious tricks of <hi>Stella,</hi>
he could not hide thoſe reſentments of hatred which he had conceived againſt her. That
ſhepheardeſſe alſo, after addreſſes in hopes of regaining him, finding all her endeavours to
be in vaine, ſhe alſo turned her amity into hatred, which was ſo publiquely known unto
every one, as they were commonly called. The Friends Enemies. The ſhepheardeſſe did not
at that time returne any anſwer, becauſe <hi>Hylas</hi> as ſhe began, did ſilence her with ſinging
out theſe lines.</p>

                  <p>At theſe laſt words this Company was ſo neare <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and her Companions, that they
all ſaluted each other, and left ſinging to enquire of each others welfare: <hi>Hylas,</hi> he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelfe unto <hi>Silvander;</hi> Oh, my good friend, ſaid he unto him, I ſee that here is not
one in all the company that knows how to love but I for if there was you would not thus
trifle away your time, but go preſently to the faire <hi>Alexis.</hi> I believe, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi>
that we ſhall be there time enough to imploy all your Conſtancy: No, no, replied <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi>
he has all the reaſon in the world to make haſte, otherwiſe there would be ſome
danger, leſt the end of his love ſhould be before the beginning of our journey. Perhaps
you think (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that you have given me a notable check, in ſaying, that I doe
never love any long, but I take it as one of the greateſt commendations you can give me.
For good <hi>Silvander</hi> tell me, Is not he that goes as much ground in an hour, as another
does in a whole day, is not he, I ſay, the beſt Footman? and a Maſon that builds a Houſe
in a moneth, which another will not undertake under a whole yeare, is not he the beſt
Workman? If you will make your love a Lackey (ſaid <hi>Silvander</hi>) I ſhall think the faſter
it goes, the better it is; But as for your Maſon, let me tell you <hi>Hylas,</hi> that he who makes
moſt haſte is not the beſt workman, but he who does his work the beſt, does beſt deſerve that
name: for moſt haſte makes worſe work, and often ſpoils all. <hi>Hylas</hi> would have replied,
when all the Company began to ſet forward towards the Temple of the good Goddeſſe,
where <hi>Chryſante</hi> expected them at Dinner: for that venerable <hi>Druid</hi> underſtanding their
determination, and being deſirous to viſit the faire <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſhe invited them all unto
her houſe, that ſhe might make one of their company: this requeſt, which was honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto them, was not denyed, and therefore <hi>Silvander</hi> left the inconſtant <hi>Hylas</hi> to wait
upon <hi>Diana,</hi> being exceedingly glad of this opportunity of being with her when <hi>Paris</hi>
was not. Had the diſguiſed <hi>Alexis</hi> looked the right way, ſhe might eaſily have ſeen them
come from the field of <hi>Mercury;</hi> for the Grove where ſhe was, ſurveyed the place; but
her eyes were ſo fixed upon the place where <hi>Aſtrea</hi> dwelt, that ſhe ſtood like a ſtatue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
no ſignes that ſhe was alive, but onely breathing or rather ſighing.</p>
                  <p>She had longer ſtood in this muſing poſture, if <hi>Leonide</hi> had not diverted her: this
Nymph not being able to extinguiſh her flames of affection towards <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhe was
ſo much delighted in the company of <hi>Alexis,</hi> that ſhe was abſent from him as little as
poſſible ſhe could. The wiſe <hi>Adamas</hi> having the words of <hi>Silvia</hi> ſtill freſh in his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
though he knew well enough what ardent affection that ſhepheard had unto the faire
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> yet did he live in much perplexity, knowing very well that his Neece was not ſo
disfurniſhed of natures gifts, but that ſhe might in time worke upon a young heart, and
make it forget all reſpects of loyalty and duty.</p>
                  <p>This conſideration was ſo ſtrong in him, that ſhe would never have permitted this
young ſhepheard to enter his houſe, under the habit name and motion of his Daughter
<hi>Alexis,</hi> had not the Oracle made a promiſe unto him, that when <hi>Celadon</hi> did enjoy his
contentment, his age ſhould then be happy; ſo as being intereſted in point of happineſſe,
he choſe rather to take ſo much paines to watch the actions of them both, then to loſe
that happineſſe which the Heavens had promiſed. Now becauſe he could not have his
eye alwayes upon them, in reſpect his domeſtique and publique affaires invited him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
way; he charged <hi>Paris</hi> to be preſent with them as much as he could.</p>
                  <p>This morning when he heard they were both gone out of the houſe, and that <hi>Paris</hi>
was not with them, he went immediately after them, and followed his Neece ſo cloſe, as
he was in the Grove almoſt as ſoone as ſhee, where <hi>Alexis</hi> had beene along while enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
her thoughts: the noiſe which the Nimphs made as ſhe came cauſed <hi>Celadon</hi> to
looke that way, and as he turned he ſpyed the Druide comming, unto whom ſhe bore
ſo much reſpective reverence, that though ſhe had rather have beene alone entertaining
his thoughts of <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> yet ſeeming otherwiſe, ſhe went to meet him, and bid him good
morrow with a countenance of joy more then accuſtomed; of which <hi>Adamas</hi> taking
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53527:6"/>
notice, after his morning ſalute, he told her that her countenance of jollity did preſage
but a bad concluſion of the day. If it pleaſe, good Father, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
contentment by it; for as for me, I have no hopes but in death; and if you did
obſerve me with a merrier countenance then ordinary, it is becauſe I thinke my ſelfe
every day neerer the end of that torment which Fortune hath ordained for mee; imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in this, thoſe who are in a long and tedious journey, who when they come to their
Inn at night, are pleaſed to thinke that ſo much of their paines is leſſened; the Druide
returned this cold anſwer; My dear Child, thoſe who do live without hope of comfort
in their miſeries, doe not only offend againſt the Providence of great <hi>Tautates,</hi> but alſo
againſt the prudence of them who have the Guardianſhip of them. In this occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have a double cauſe of Complaint againſt you: you have offended both the Gods
and Mee, as Druide of the Country, into whoſe hands the Oracle hath committed you.
Father, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> I ſhould be extreamly ſorry, ſhould I offend either the great
<hi>Tautates</hi> or you; and for an explanation of my words, give me leave to tell you that
my intention was not to doubt either in the Providence of our great Gods, or in your
Prudence; but I doe beleeve it is not the will of the Gods to give me any contentment as
long as I live, and that my misfortune is ſo great as it is beyond all humane Prudence to
helpe it. You muſt know, replyed <hi>Adamas;</hi> that the ſlighting of a benefit received, does
often withdraw the hand of the Benefactor, and makes it more ſlacke in conferring then
it was before; take heed you provoke not the Heavens unto the like for you doe ſo ill
accept of what they have begun to doe for you, as you have reaſon to feare, that in
lieu of happineſſe, they will inflict new puniſhments. Doe you not conſider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that when
you had mured up your ſelfe in a Salvage Rocke, the Gods ſent <hi>Silvander</hi> with conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
unto you? Then, to make their goodneſſe more apparent unto you; did not he
cauſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> her ſelfe to come unto you? Did you not ſee her; nay, almoſt hear her, and
the Lamentations ſhe made for you? what better beginnings of happineſſe could
you poſſibly hope for then theſe: I will not inſtance the viſits of <hi>Leonide</hi> and my ſelfe,
for perhaps they were troubleſome unto you; but I may well mention the goodneſſe of
the Gods to you, in inſpiring mee to bring you unto my houſe, under the notion and
habit of my Daughter <hi>Alexis,</hi> for doubtleſſe it is her whom <hi>Aſtrea</hi> comes to ſee:
What more auſpitious beginning can you have then this? Can you imagine, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the particular aide and aſſiſtance of the Gods, this habit and diſguiſe could delude
the eyes of ſo many perſons? All the people of your owne Towne, your friends, your
familiars, have ſeen you, and been deceived; your owne Brother himſelfe is miſtaken;
but the favours of <hi>Tautates</hi> reſt not here: for hee inſpired <hi>Aſtrea</hi> to come and ſee you:
what can you deſire more for a proſperous beginning? Yet I ſee, ſuch is your ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
that ſtill you complain, or at leaſt receive not theſe benefits with a thankefull heart.
Take heed Child, you provoke not a Diety too ſarre, leaſt they ſhould withdraw theſe
favours, and give you a juſt cauſe of condolement. Father, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> I doe moſt
gratefully acknowledge the goodneſſe of <hi>Tautates,</hi> and your indulgent care over mee;
but ſtill I cannot chuſe but complaine; for I am yet like unto a poore afflicted man, who
hath a thouſand torments at once upon him; though one or two of thoſe torments be
taken away, yet the reſt which remaine are enough to move complaint. The Druide
was ready to anſwer when he ſaw <hi>Paris</hi> coming towards them, who being clad in his
ſhepherds habit, made it manifeſt that Love prompted unto the dreſſe. <hi>Leonide</hi> alſo flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
her ſelfe in an opinion that her beauty needed not to ſubmit unto the beauty of
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſhe uſed all her art, and trimmed up her ſelfe to the beſt advantage that <hi>Alexis</hi>
ſeeing her in that dreſſe, and comparing <hi>Aſtrea</hi> with her, the artificiall luſtre of the one,
might dimme the naturall ſimplicity of the others beauty. <hi>Alexis</hi> in her uſuall habit
ſeemed to care leaſt for this viſit, though ſhe had the moſt intereſt, and becauſe ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
not to be knowne by any, ſhee added nothing to her ordinary dreſſe; beſides, ſhe
knew that her happineſſe was to be expected from fortune and not beauty: but however,
ſhe appeared ſo fair in that ſimple habit without any artifice, that <hi>Leonide</hi> could not keep
her eyes off her.</p>
                  <p>After ſome common diſcourſe, <hi>Paris</hi> who was paſſionately in love with <hi>Diana,</hi> to
make himſelfe more pleaſing in her eye, he aſſumed the habit of a ſhepherd; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
furniſhed with ſo much patience as to ſtay till their coming, he told <hi>Adamas,</hi> that
if it pleaſed him, he would goe and meet thoſe fair ſhepherdeſſes, who were to viſit his
Siſter, and conduct them to the beſt and neereſt way. The <hi>Druide</hi> knowing what affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53527:6"/>
he had unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and not diſallowing it for ſome reaſons, which hereafter ſhall
be declared, did commend his deſigne, hinting unto him that courteſie and civility, of all
the vertues did moſt attract the hearts of people, and that it was the naturall quality of
perſons well borne. <hi>Paris</hi> upon this leave went preſently towards <hi>Lignon,</hi> and going down
the Hill unto the bridge of Botereſſe, he followed the River, taking into a little path upon
his right hand, which led him into the Wood, where the empty tombe of <hi>Celadon</hi> was
erected; and paſſing on he came unto the Meadow which is before the Temple of <hi>Aſtrea.</hi>
He had no ſooner ſet foot in it, but he ſpyed on the other ſide of it two Horſemen, the
one of which was armed; he had on his right hand a Gantlet, and on the other a Buckler,
a Plume of black and white, which waved over the Crupper of his Horſe, his Corſlet was
ſet with Lions, his Sword Falchion like, which turned up at the end like to a demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle,
hung by his ſide in a rich ſcarfe.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as <hi>Paris</hi> perceived him, he remembred what hapned unto <hi>Diana</hi> when <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidas</hi>
and <hi>Filander</hi> were ſlaine, and therefore retreated into the Wood, yet being very
deſirous to know more of them, he ſtill kept his eye upon them through the thick Wood.
He ſaw that as ſoone as they were entred into the Meadow and ſpyed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Fountaine, which is at the entrance into the Temple; the Cavelier lighted from his
Horſe, and the other whom he judged to be his Servant, ran to him, held his ſtirrop,
tooke his Horſe, unbridled him, and without any reſpect unto the place, let him eat
upon the ſacred Graſſe: Meane while the Cavelier went to the Fountaine; dranke of
the water, and waſhed his hands and face. <hi>Paris</hi> by his deportment did imagine that
his intention was not to offer harme unto any, and this opinion made him ſo bold as to
go neerer him, yet ſtill concealing himſelfe in the thicke Wood; ſo as he unſeen came
ſo neere them, that he could both heare and ſee all that they ſaid and did: He ſaw that
the Cavalier was both young and faire, though extreame ſorrow appeared in his face;
then looking upon his Armes, he thought him to be a <hi>Gaule,</hi> and that he was in
love: for he bore upon his ſilver Sheild a <hi>Tyger</hi> feeding upon a Hart, with
this Motto.
<q>Thou gav'ſt me death, and I maintaine thy life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps he had obſerved every thing both longer and better, had he not beene preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the ſighs of this Caveller, who looking fixedly upon the Fountaine, rowſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
as out of a deepe ſlumber, and lifting up his eyes towards Heaven, he taxed his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
with Puſillanimity, for ſupporting ſo many misfortunes; his words were ſeconded
with many a ſigh, and ſighs ſeconded with ſhowers of teares, which trickled downe
his cheekes into the Fountaine: Preſently after, lying along upon the ground, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his arms hang looſe, he grew pale, and his complexion changed, ſo as his ſervant
who kept an eye upon him, ſeeing him in this condition, he was affraid leaſt he ſhould
ſwoone; he ran therefore unto him, caſt a little water in his face, and recovered him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he loſt his knowledge or ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But hee, opening his eyes, and lifting them faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
up to heaven, made ſuch ſad Lamentation, that his ſervant could not chuſe but ſigh:
which he obſerving; what <hi>Halladine</hi> (ſaid he) doſt thou ſigh? Sir, ſaid the Servant, I
ſigh more to ſee ſuchan alteration in you, then for the diſtaſter of which you complain: for
to be deceived by a woman, to be betrayed by a Rivall, that virtue ſhould procure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
and that fortune ſhould favour the deſignes of enemies, is not at all ſtrange, becauſe
it is ordinary: But I muſt needs wonder to ſee the courage of <hi>Damon,</hi> which hitherto I
believed invincible, and which hath made him eſteemed and feared both of friends and
enemies, ſhould now ſhrink at a common accident, which inferiour courages are wont
to reſiſt. A thought of revenge, if nothing elſe, methinkes ſir, ſhould move you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
your ſelfe untill you have found out <hi>Madonthe,</hi> that you might in herpreſence call
them to an account, who are the cauſes of your diſpleaſure. For Gods ſake ſir, conſider
that a Calumny which is not diſproved may well paſſe for a truth; and conſequently
<hi>Madonthe</hi> had reaſon to treat you as ſhe did. <hi>Paris</hi> obſerved, that at the name of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donthe,</hi>
the Cavelier aſſumed a little vigour, and that looking upon him, he anſwered with
a faint voice; Ah <hi>Halladin,</hi> didſt thou but know what torments are upon me, thou
wouldſt ſay that I doe want courage, ſince I doe endure them any longer and live. Oh ye
Gods, who both ſee and heare my unjuſt ſorrowes, and my juſt complaints, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
a welcome death upon me, or elſe take away the memory of ſo many diſpleaſures
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53527:7"/>
from mee. The Gods, ſaid the Servant, doe uſe to favour thoſe who by their courage and
Prudence endeavour to helpe themſelves in their misfortunes, and to decline thoſe who
loſing their heart and courage, have recourſe only to prayers and weake tears; why doe
you thinke, did they beſtow upon you a ſoule of a higher generoſity then upon others?
doe you thinke it was to make uſe of it only in proſperity, and not to encounter the guſts
of adverſity? Certainely Sir, you ought to ſhew the effects of it upon all occaſions, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in adverſity, to the end that thoſe who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ee that vertue in you, may praiſe the Gods
for imparting ſo much perfection unto man, and conſidering it in you, they may come
to the knowledge of the great Giver. Will you offer to abuſe the favours and the hopes
which every one hath in you? I have heard ſome ſay who knew you in your infancy,
that you promiſed a noble courage even from the very Cradle, and ſhewed ſo much ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
of ſoule, as every one conceived that you would prove an example unto the
world of an invincible ſpirit: will you not Sir anſwer all their hopes and expectations?
There are ſome women who thinke it a ſhame to ſhrinke at the blowes of Fortune,
though their natures be puſillanimous and timerous; yet being diſpoſed unto vertuous ends
they often change their Natures: you Sir are a man: that very word commands you to
be couragious: you who are a Cavelier, brought up in Martiall wayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hath look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
grim death in the face; you who have acquired great reputation in the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
you I ſay, who are <hi>Damon,</hi> who never ſtarted at any difficulty, now faint at ſuch
an accident as this? Will you offer to die before you doe an act worthy not only of a
Cavelier, but of a common man? <hi>Halladine, Halladine,</hi> anſwered the Cavelier, theſe
conſiderations are good in another ſeaſon, or in any other man but my ſelfe: alas, what
act can I doe, which will doe me any good, only dying excepted; for all others are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
unto her for whom only I deſire to live. Thou knoweſt that <hi>Madonthe</hi> is the only
aime of all my deſires and ſince all my hopes of her is loſt, what can I deſire but death?
But Sir, ſaid <hi>Halladine,</hi> how doe you know that all your hopes of <hi>Madonthe</hi> are loſt?
Thou thy ſelfe ſaid the Cavelier doſt know as much: give me leave to tell you Sir,
(replyed <hi>Halladine</hi>) that I doe know how the caſe ſtands better then you doe: for Sir
when you commanded me to carry your letter and <hi>Therſanders</hi> Ring unto her, and the
Handkerchief full of your blood unto the helliſh <hi>Leriana,</hi> by chance I met with them
both together; and though that divelliſh wretch who was the cauſe of all your miſery
did ſtand immovable at your meſſage, which I declared from you unto them: yet I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<hi>Madonthe</hi> firſt to grow pale, afterwards to tremble, and laſtly when ſhee heard of
your death, and ſaw the blood, ſhe was ſurpriſed with ſo much ſorrow, that had ſhe not
beene held, ſhe had ſunke downe, ſo as had I thought you alive, doubtleſſe I had
brought you very good newes from her. Oh my friend <hi>Halladine</hi> (ſaid the Cavelier)
what a weake concluſion doſt thou make? Didſt thou but know the nature of women
thou wouldſt confeſſe with me, that ſuch alterations in them doe proceed rather from
Compaſſion then Paſſion: for certainly all women are naturally pittifull, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is an ordinary effect of their weake ſoules; ſo as what thou obſerveſt in <hi>Madonthe</hi>
proceeded from the pittifulneſſe of her Nature: But, <hi>Halladine,</hi> it is not pitty or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
but paſſion and love that I doe deſire from her, and this thou didſt not diſcover
in her ſoule. Alas Sir, ſaid <hi>Halladi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e,</hi> unto what a miſerable condition are you reduced
ſince you your ſelfe are the very worſt enemy that you have? I wonder ſuch an accident
ſhould worke ſuch an alteration in your judgement. Admit the worſt, that <hi>Madonthe</hi>
does not love you; yet if you deſire to overcome her and obtaine her favour, why doe
you not goe where ſhe is, but ſhun all community with mankind, or habitable places?
Since hatred is the higher, (ſaid the Cavelier) for ſeeing the perſon hated, have I not
good reaſon to ſhun the ſight of <hi>Madenthe,</hi> becauſe ſhe hates me? and ſo being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of her whom onely I deſire; all things elſe that I ſee are diſpleaſing unto mee, why
then ſhouldeſt thou thinke it ſtrange, that I ſhould diſrelliſh all others, ſince I cannot ſee
<hi>Madonthe?</hi> Good Sir, ſaid <hi>Halladine,</hi> what comfort can you expect to finde in Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes,
and uncoth ſavage places? Death, (ſaid the Cavelier) for that is all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
I hope for ſince it is ſo, ſaid <hi>Hallad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

face, that ſhe may ſee you die for her, then to languiſh away your life amongſt
Rockes and Caves and ſolitary Woods, where none knowes what you do: Thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
well <hi>Halladine</hi> anſwered the Cavelier, but thou knoweſt that <hi>Madonthe</hi> is fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with her darling <hi>Therſander;</hi> and to enjoy him with more ſecurity, keepes cloſe
from any finding them: Doſt thou thinke that I would not have had recourſe unto
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53527:7"/>
ſome deſperat act, if I had not had ſuch an intention as thou ſpeakeſt of? Upon theſe
words, teares hindered his ſpeech, and pitty moved <hi>Halladine</hi> unto the ſame, ſo as for a
while they both ſtood ſpeechleſſe. <hi>Paris</hi> who liſtned attentively, hearing <hi>Madonthe</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
could not at the firſt imagine it to be her, whom he had ſeen diſguiſed in the habit
of a ſhepheardeſſe with <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana:</hi> But when he heard <hi>Therſander</hi> named, he
made no doubt but that it was ſhe, and therefore he hearkned more attentively, when
<hi>Halladine</hi> began to ſpeak thus; For my part, ſir, ſaid <hi>Halladine,</hi> were your caſe mine,
I would never die for one who changes me for another, but if the diſpleaſure of it did ſo far
tranſport me as to reſolve upon death, I would firſt ſend death to the man, who is the
cauſe of my loſſe before me, and he ſhould die by no hand but my owne. For beſide the
ſweet of revenge, I would let her who changed me for him, ſee what a bad choice ſhe had
made: I would never ſuffer him to inherit my happineſſe after my death. Therefore I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
you ſir, if you be reſolved upon death, that firſt you give <hi>Therſander</hi> his death, who
is the obſtacle of your happineſſe, and cauſe of your death. I muſt confeſſe (ſaid the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er)
that in this thou ſpeakeſt reaſon; but <hi>Halladine,</hi> thou knoweſt he conceales him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he is afraid of ſuch a deſigne; and to prevent it, He, <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and her Nurſe,
keep ſo cloſe, as none knowes where they are. Whileſt he was ſaying ſo,
and whilſt <hi>Paris</hi> was liſtning with an inquiſitive eare, the poore diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhepheard <hi>Adraſtes</hi> came ſinging ſome mad freakes in diſcompoſed meeter,
without any order or ſenſe: this miſerable lover, ſince the judgement of the Nimph <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
given againſt him in favour of <hi>Palemon,</hi> did ſo reſent his ſeparation from <hi>Doris,</hi> that
being out of all hopes, his minde was diſtracted. 'Tis true, he had ſome intervalls in which
he would talke pertinently enough, but then preſently he would change, and rove a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
miles from the matter, ſo as he moved all that knew him unto pitty, and others to
laughter; love being the cauſe of his diſtraction, all his follies harped upon that ſtring;
and when his good intervalls were upon him, his complaint was all upon the obduracy
of <hi>Doris,</hi> the injuſtice of <hi>Leonide,</hi> the good fortune of <hi>Palemon,</hi> and his owne miſery.
Theſe ſtrangers liſtned unto him, but could hardly underſtand what he ſaid, ſince not one
word was pertinent unto another: yet he, raviſhed in his owne fancy, not ſeeing them,
came ſinging cloſe to them; and had not the Horſes neighed, perhaps he had paſſed
on without a ſight of them. The Cavelier hearing him very often intermixe with his
roving language, the words Love, Beauty, and Paſſion, did know what his diſeaſe was,
he deſired to know a little more, and riſing up, he ſpoke thus unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Good friend,
tell us in what Country we are? and what is the miſery which makes you thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine?
<hi>Araſtes</hi> ſeeing the Cavelier, and his minde running all upon love, did anſwer him:
Sir, ſhe is ſo infinitely faire, that no mortal can equall her, and <hi>Palemon</hi> hath raviſhed her
from me. The Cavelier replyed, who is that <hi>Palemon? Palemon,</hi> anſwered the ſhepheard,
is <hi>Palemon;</hi> yes, yes, ſaid the ſtranger, I know that is his name: but what is he, of what
quality? At this queſtion, <hi>Adraſtes</hi> was a little troubled, and looking wildly upon the
Cavelier, he anſwered, <hi>Palemon</hi> is one whom <hi>Adraſtes</hi> does not love. And <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> ſaid
the Cavelier, who is he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then the ſhepheard growing more frantique, broke out into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
laughter, and in concluſion, began to cry, ſaying, the Nimph has wronged me;
<hi>Doris</hi> at the beginning cryed, then went away; and though I called her back, yet ſhe
would not ſo much as look back upon me, was ever any thus uſed? The Cavelier was
at firſt amazed at his language, and plainly ſaw that he was diſtracted, and thinking love
to be the cauſe, he pittied him; then turning towards his ſervant, ſee, ſaid he, what will
be my fortune, if I doe not die: for certainly this ſhepheard is run mad for love. Love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Adraſtes,</hi> is as mad as either. For <hi>Palemon</hi> if he were not, <hi>Doris</hi> would either have
been here, or I where ſhe is. Thus he roved into ſuch odd impertinencies, that <hi>Halladine</hi>
could not forbeare laughing, which the Knight perceiving, Thou dost laugh at this poore
ſhepheard, ſaid he unto <hi>Halladine,</hi> but does not conſider that perhaps thou wilt have the
ſame occaſion to laugh at me. At me ſaid the ſhepheard, why, I am <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> and I would
know whether <hi>Palemon</hi> will live a long time or no. The Cavelier was ſo troubled with
his impertinent ſpeeches, and ſo unwilling to be diverted from his thoughts, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his ſervant to bridle their Horſes, and getting up, they went into the wood
where <hi>Paris</hi> was, who was in two or three mindes whether or no he ſhould ſhew himſelf,
and as a ſtranger, offer him all poſſible aſſiſtance, as by the Lawes of Hoſpitality he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged:
but conſidering that if he engaged himſelfe with this Cavelier, he ſhould loſe an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53527:8"/>
occaſion of ſerving <hi>Diana:</hi> alſo thinking it better to advertiſe <hi>Madonthe</hi> and <hi>Therſander</hi>
of him, he ſtill concealed himſelfe upon theſe conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paris</hi> was no ſooner out of the wood, but looking towards the great Meadow, he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied
the Company which he came to meet: amongſt the reſt, there was <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,
Phillis, Stella, Doris, Aminthe, Celidea, Floris, Circene, Palanice,</hi> and <hi>Laonice;</hi> all
theſe rallied together with curioſity, to ſee the beauty of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and the rarities in the
houſe of <hi>Adamas:</hi> There was alſo many ſhepheards, amongſt the reſt, <hi>Lycidas, Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

                        </gap>mon,</hi> and <hi>Corrilas,</hi> all who, to beguile time
and length of way, either ſung, or held out ſome pleaſant diſcourſe. <hi>Paris</hi> was now ſo
neare that <hi>Silvander</hi> knew him, and becauſe he led <hi>Diana</hi> by the arme, he thought it
would diſpleaſe his Miſtreſſe, if he did not yield his place unto <hi>Paris</hi> out of reſpect,
though not unto any out of love: And to oblige her by the Act, he ſaid unto her in a
low voice, I beſeech you miſtreſs command me to let your arme go, that I may doe it out
of obedience unto your command, ſince I cannot doe it by my good will. Shepheard, ſaid
ſhe, and ſmiled, ſince you think my command will doe you ſervice in the Act, I do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it you. Oh Heavens (ſaid the ſhepheard) who would not wholly devote himſelfe
to your ſervice, ſince you are ſo obliging even in your diſobligings. He durſt not ſay any
more leſt <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould heare, for he was very neare, ſo as <hi>Diana</hi> advanced to ſalute him,
as all the company did. <hi>Silvander</hi> had no ſooner quitted his place, but his Rivall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
it with as much contentment, as the other left it with diſpleaſure. After ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<hi>Paris</hi> obſerved that neither <hi>Madonthe</hi> nor <hi>Therſander</hi> were in the company,
and therefore he asked <hi>Diana</hi> of them: unto whom <hi>Laonice</hi> anſwered, that <hi>Madonthe</hi>
was this morning very ill diſpoſed, and that <hi>Therſander</hi> kept her company. I ſhould
have been glad (ſaid <hi>Paris</hi>) to have met them here, that I might have acquainted them
how ſome enemy of their's is come into the Country; and that it is beſt both for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donthe</hi>
and <hi>Therſander,</hi> to look well unto themſelves. <hi>Silvander</hi> who had alwaies an eye
upon <hi>Diana,</hi> he heard what <hi>Paris</hi> ſaid; and becauſe he was a great eſteemer of <hi>Madonthes</hi>
virtues, he took upon him to acquaint them at his return, <hi>Laonice</hi> who watched for an
occaſion to be revenged upon this ſhepheard, ſhe obſerved how ready he was to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him this office, to the end ſhe might make uſe of it in time and place. <hi>Diana</hi> alſo, who
began to have ſome ſparkes of good will towards this ſhepheard, did take notice of it,
as hereafter ſhall be declared, which <hi>Leonice</hi> did very well perceive. But in the meane time,
leſt the reverent <hi>Chryſante</hi> ſhould ſtay too long, all the Company ſet forward. <hi>Diana</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<hi>Phillis</hi> to be alwaies near her, leſt being alone, <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould fall into diſcourſe of
his affections: therefore ſhe kept her ſelfe on the other ſide of that ſhepheardeſſe, and took
her by the arme. <hi>Calidon</hi> waited upon <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and <hi>Tircis</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> kept together;
as for <hi>Hylas,</hi> he undertook no body, but was ſometimes the firſt, and ſometimes the laſt
of the company, without fixing himſelfe unto any of the ſhepheardeſſes; he took no more
regard of <hi>Phillis,</hi> then if he had never ſeen her in his life; at which <hi>Tireis</hi> admired, and
after a little conſideration of it, he could not chuſe but ſay aloud unto him; Is it poſſible
<hi>Hylas,</hi> that you ſhould be ſo near <hi>Phillis,</hi> and take no notice of her? <hi>Hylas</hi> ſeeming as
if he had not ſeen her, turned about as if he looked for her: at laſt, looking upon her, I
aſſure you, my time-paſt Miſtreſs (ſaid he unto her) that my heart was ſo much in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, that my eyes never informed me that you were here; and perhaps the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
has brought us both together; very likely, anſwered <hi>Phillis;</hi> you came with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſee the faire <hi>Alexis,</hi> and I came with ſorrowes that I have loſt you, eſpecially at the
game of the Faireſt, as you ſay it was. Faith <hi>Phillis,</hi> anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> the heavens would
have it ſo: How <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Thircis;</hi> doe you thinke that the heavens are the cauſe of
your inconſtant humour? as well (anſwered <hi>Hylas</hi>) as of thoſe vaine teares which you
ſhed upon the cold aſhes of <hi>Cleon.</hi> Things which doe not depend upon our ſelves (ſaid
<hi>Tircis</hi>) and whoſe cauſes are unknown unto us, we doe ordinarily aſcribe unto the puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
and will of the Gods. But ſuch things as the cauſes whereof are known, we never
uſe to aſcribe them unto the Gods as the Authors, eſpecially ſuch things as are ill, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
is, for that were flat blaſphemy; whether inconſtancy be good or bad, anſwered
<hi>Hylas,</hi> is a queſtion which will admit of diſpute; but it muſt needs be confeſſed, that it
proceeds from the Gods; for is not beauty the work of great <hi>Tautates?</hi> and what makes
me change but beauty? were not <hi>Alexis</hi> fairer then <hi>Phillis,</hi> I had never changed.</p>
                  <p>Beauty then is the cauſe, and if ſo, why may we not impute it unto the Gods without
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53527:8"/>
any blaſphemy, eſpecially ſince wee ſee by the effects that the change is good and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
being according to the laws of Nature which obliges every one to look for wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
is beſt. That beauty is the worke of great <hi>Tautates</hi> (anſwered <hi>Tircis</hi>) I doe confeſſe
and more, that it is the greateſt of all which fall within the compaſſe of our ſenſes: but
to affirme that it ſhould be the cauſe of inconſtancy, is an errour, as if one ſhould accuſe
Light, with the fault of thoſe who goe out of the way, becauſe it ſhewes them ſeverall
Pathes. And as to your aſſertion, that inconſtancy is according to the Laws of nature,
which commands every one to aime at the beſt: take heed <hi>Hylas</hi> that it be not of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
nature, and quite contrary to the Command you mention: For how doe you
know, that your change is for the beſt; for my part I ſee no advantage you get by it: but
the loſſe of that time which you imploy about it; you take much unprofitable paines
to no end, and make every one ſcorne your friendſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as too light to be entertained: if
you thinke theſe to be advantages, I confeſſe you have ſome reaſon to court them; but
if you will credit Judgements which are not infected with your owne diſeaſe, you will
find them to be the greateſt evils that you can meet withall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diana</hi> who obſerved that <hi>Tircis</hi> ſpoke in good earneſt, and that <hi>Hylas</hi> perhaps would
grow angry, ſhe would needs interrupt them, ſo as this diſcourſe might paſſe no farther;
which to effect ſhe put <hi>Phillis</hi> upon it, who began thus: Heretofore, my late Servant
(ſaid ſhee unto him) you were wont to complaine, that of all the company <hi>Silvander</hi>
was your only enemy; but now methinkes <hi>Tircis</hi> hath ſupplyed his place. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
my late Miſtreſſe (anſwered <hi>Hylas</hi>) for it is very ordinary to ſee ill opinions take
hold upon ignorant perſons: <hi>Tircis</hi> would have replyed, had he not beene prevented by
poore <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> who being come into the Wood, they ſaw talking unto Trees and Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
as if they had beene people of his acquaintance: ſometimes he fancied that he
ſaw <hi>Doris,</hi> and then kneeling downe upon the ground he adored her, and as if he were
begging for the favour of a kiſſe of her hand, he made a long ſpeech: ſometimes againe
he fancied that he ſaw <hi>Leonide,</hi> and then he rayled and wiſhed her all manner of bad
Fortune: but when he fancied <hi>Palemon,</hi> the expreſſions of his jealouſie was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant;
for though it was very confuſed, yet it gave good evidence of the grandure of his
affection. The company paſſed cloſe by him, and though the very ſight of him moved
every one to pitty, yet much more when he ſpyed <hi>Doris,</hi> becauſe then he ſtood immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
like a Pillar; his eyes fixed upon her, and his armes a croſſe his breſt, without a word,
as if he were raviſhed. Afterwards pointing at her with his finger, when ſhe paſſed by
him, he ſaid with a deep ſigh; ſee, ſee where ſhe is; then fixing his eyes upon her, hee
never moved them as long as he could ſee her: but when he began to loſe the ſight of
her, he began to run untill he was before her; then he looked upon none in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
but her, and ſo ſilently looking upon her, he accompanied her unto the outgoing
of the Wood, for farther he durſt not paſſe: when he loſt the ſight of her, he began to
cry out: Adieu <hi>Palemon,</hi> make much of <hi>Doris,</hi> and upon this he ruſhed into the Wood,
where he almoſt alwayes was, becauſe that was the place where <hi>Leonide</hi> gave judgement
againſt him. Every one pittyed him except <hi>Hylas,</hi> who preſently began to laugh, and
turning towards <hi>Silvander;</hi> This Shepherd, ſaid he unto him, is an effect of that conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
which you commend ſo much; which of us two doe you thinke is in moſt danger
to reſemble him? Complexions moſt perfect (anſwered <hi>Silvander</hi>) are moſt eaſily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
but to chuſe I had rather be like <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> then like <hi>Hylas.</hi> The choice of the
one, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> is in your power; but not of the other: How doe you meane it, ſaid <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander?</hi>
The meaning ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi> is nothing difficult: my meaning is, that if you
will you may become a foole like <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> your humour is inclinable to it, but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reſemble <hi>Hylas.</hi> In this, you are moſt deceived, replyed <hi>Silvander;</hi> For things that
depend upon the will may be in choice, but things that depend upon the will of another
are more difficult; and therefore every one that will, may be either vertuous or vitious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but they cannot be well or ſicke when they will: now the condition wherein poore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtes</hi>
is, it is not voluntary, but forced, as proceeding from a malady, the remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which is not in his hands, but your malady depends wholly upon your will; ſo
as it is demonſtrative by reaſon, that it is an eaſier matter to reſemble you, then that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
Shepherd. Admit it ſo, (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) yet is it not better to reſemble me, ſince if
I will, I can deliver my ſelfe from my malady as you call it, then to reſemble <hi>Adraſtes</hi>
who cannot free himſelfe from his? Tis true, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> but if you doe leave
off your inconſtancy, then you doe not reſemble your ſelfe: I did ſay that I had rather
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53527:9"/>
reſemble <hi>Adraſtes</hi> then <hi>Hylas;</hi> that is, <hi>Adraſtes</hi> the mad, than <hi>Hylas</hi> the inconſtant.
Truly, (ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and interrupted them) you preſſe too hard upon my late Servant;
I muſt needs take his part and ſay, that inconſtancy is better then madneſſe, ſince it does
not take away the uſe of reaſon, which doth onely diſtinguiſh men from beaſts: you are
miſtaken Shepherdeſſe (ſaid <hi>Silvander</hi>) for the diſeaſe of <hi>Hylas</hi> and that of <hi>Adraſtes</hi>
are both of them reall maladies; but that of <hi>Hylas</hi> is the worſe, becauſe all maladies of
ſoule, are worſe than thoſe of the body. As for the reaſon which you urge, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
for if the cauſe of a malady doe proceed from ſome defect in the body, yet that
body may ſtill be reaſonable as we ſee thoſe who are intoxicated with Wine; now the
malady of <hi>Adraſtes</hi> doeth doubtleſſe proceed from the weakneſſe of his braine which is
not able to endure the ſentence which <hi>Leonide</hi> gave againſt him; but that of <hi>Hylas</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from an imperfect judgement, which hinders him from diſcerning good from bad,
but ſuffers vices to become habituall. And becauſe it is the reaſonable ſoule which gives
being unto men, and makes them differ from beaſts, it is better according to your own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t
to be unſound in body than in ſoule; 'tis better to be a hanſome Horſe or a Dog,
then to be the bare outſide of a man; without a ſound ſoule, becauſe a Horſe is a perfect
Animall; but he who hath a rotten ſoule and unſound intellectuals is infinitely imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
and therefore I conclude it is better to be diſeaſed as <hi>Adraſtes</hi> is, then as
<hi>Hylas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the Company did laugh at this concluſion, and the noiſe was ſo high, that it was
long before <hi>Hylas</hi> could be heard; And when he began, they ſaw the ſage <hi>Chryſante,</hi>
who ſpying them afarre off, came to meet them with a great Company of her Virgins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

therefore putting an end to all diſputes, they advanced forward to falute her, and to doe
her all the honour and reverence which was due unto her vertue and profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Temple of the good Goddeſſe, where the venerable <hi>Chryſante</hi> reſided, was at the
bottome of a delightful Hill, which was waſhed by the cleere wave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and on the other ſide ſtood the ſacred Grove of the great <hi>Tautates.</hi> In this ſumptuous
Temple which the <hi>Romans</hi> dedicated unto <hi>Veſta,</hi> and to the good Goddeſſe did the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall
Virgins officiate, according to the cuſtome of the <hi>Romans:</hi> The venerable <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſante</hi>

order.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> under pretence of helping the <hi>Heduois</hi> whom they termed their
friends and confederates, did ſeize upon <hi>Gaule,</hi> and ſubjected them unto their Republique;
one principall marke of their victory was to cauſe their Gods to be adored in all places
of their uſurpation; not thinking themſelves intire poſſeſſors, if they did not intereſt
their Gods, and oblige them to their preſervation; and yet leſt they ſhould ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
inſupportable at the firſt, they permitted the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who adored but one God,
under the names of <hi>Tautates, Heſius, Tharames</hi> and <hi>Bellinus,</hi> to uſe their ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes,
and live in their old Religion; knowing very well that nothing is more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
to men, then tyrannically to force their beliefe. And therefore when they entred
into the Dominions of the <hi>Seguſians,</hi> they would not alter any of their Cuſtomes,
Manners, Government or Religion. But when they found in this ſacred Grove an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
dedicated unto a Virgin who ſhould have a Child, and that Divinity ſerved by the
Daughters of Druids, they had much more reſpect unto it, thinking that place was
conſecrated under another name, either unto the good Goddeſſe, (in whoſe ſervice men
could not officiate) or unto the Goddeſſe <hi>Veſta,</hi> in whoſe Temple they were wont to
place a ſtatute of a Virgin, holding a Child in her Arms: Having this opinion, not to
leſſen the honour and ſervice which they rendred unto theſe two Goddeſſes, whom they
held in great reverence; they built a Temple unto them both, with two Altars alike,
and to the honour of the good Goddeſſe, they called it <hi>Bonleia,</hi> and to the honour
of <hi>Veſta,</hi> they are called <hi>Veſtals;</hi> and becauſe the People were infinitely Religious
towards the Gods whom they adored, not knowing whether theſe Goddeſſes would
be worſhipped after the manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> or the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and alſo to content the
Inhabitants of the Country, they left the Virgin Druids to their ancient Cuſtomes and
Ceremonies unto whom they gave all authority concerning manners and oeconomique
matters: And thus was the venerable <hi>Chryſante</hi> abſolute Miſtreſſe of the Virgin Druids
and Veſtals.</p>
                  <p>This Temple was larger and more ſpacious then ſeemed to the eye, being built in an
orbicular ſome; it was covered with lead: in the middeſt and higheſt part of it, was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53527:9"/>
erected a Statute of a Virgin holding a Childe in her Armes; in the midſt of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was placed two Altars, at ſuch equall diſtance, that the one was no further from
the middle then the other; by the ſide of either of them there ſtood an Arke of white
Marble, ſupported by three Columnes in which was put all the Fruites which
were offered; at the doore ſtood a Baſon of water which they called <hi>Luſtrale,</hi> in
which the Torch which was at the Altar when divine Service was celebrated, was firſt
waſhed, and afterwards extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>When all this Company met the venerable <hi>Chryſante,</hi> it was ſo early as the morning
ſacrifice was not then begun; and therefore ſhe invited all the faire ſhepheardeſſes unto it,
telling the ſhepheards that ſhe was ſorry to rob them of their good company: but ſhe
was conſtrained unto it, by the inviolable Ordinance of the Goddeſſe, who commanded
that all men ſhould be baniſhed thoſe Altars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paris, Calidon,</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> who were moſt concerned, made anſwer, That they were
ſorry for the ſhallow merits of men, ſince that was the cauſe which moved the Goddeſſe
to thinke them unworthy of that honour, and beſeeched her and them all, that they
would not entertaine in their hearts the like hatred againſt men. To which, the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Chryſante</hi> anſwered, That the wiſe Goddeſſe had not excluded men their Altars, out
of any hatred unto them but upon other reſpects; and perhaps to make the Veſtalls more
attentive in their devotions, and their minds not drawn another way by the ſight of mens
perfections. <hi>Hylas</hi> who had no devotion unto the Gods of his own Country, and much
leſſe unto thoſe who were ſtrangers unto him, made anſwer; That if thoſe Goddeſſes did
forbid him to love faire ones, <hi>Hylas</hi> would be none of their Votaries: Shepheard, ſaid the
venerable <hi>Chryſante,</hi> I adviſe you not to provoke the Gods: Upon this word ſhe retired
into the Temple, becauſe one of the Veſtals, according to their cuſtome, came and cryed
three times,
<q>Hence, all prophane ones.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hylas</hi> therefore could not have time to reply as he intended: for as ſoon ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
the doors were ſhut; ſo as <hi>Paris,</hi> and all the ſhepheards, were forced to goe and wait
in the ſacred Grove, where the <hi>Druide</hi> was to ſacrifice, when the Veſtalls had
done</p>
                  <p>Theſe veſtall Virgins were habited in white Robes, and ſo long behinde, that they
could vaile their heads therewith, when they went into the Temple to ſacrifice. This day
was dedicated unto Veſta, for not to be ſurcharged with too many ſacrifices; their dayes
were to be divided, one day they ſacrificed unto Veſta, and another unto the good
Goddeſſe. This day then being the Veſtals, as ſoon as the doores of the Temple were
ſhut, and all the veſtall Virgins, Druids and Shepheardeſſes had taken their places, they
all bowed to the ground; as ſoon as the chiefe Veſtall ſtood up, who taking in her hand
a branch of Laurell which a young Veſtall preſented unto her, and which was dipped in
ther water, which was called Luſtrale, which ſhe brought with her in a ſilver Baſon; ſhe
ſprinkled her ſelfe therewith, and afterwards did the ſame unto all the Congregation,
who being all proſtrate upon the ground, received this water with great devotion. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
being riſen up, and ſhe returned to her ſeat, another young Virgin preſented unto
her a basket full of flowers; ſhe put one Pofie of them upon her head, and did the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſix others, who kneeled down at her feet, and who were to aſſiſt her in the ſacrifice;
one of them went preſently, and tooke the Napkin and Baſon with which they were
wont to ſacrifice. Another took the box of perfumes, which was called <hi>Acerta:</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
carried the water which was to be uſed in the ſacrifice, for the Veſtals never uſed any
Wine: And thoſe alſo of the good Goddeſſes, never uſed wine but milk: The fifth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the bundle of Vervine; and the ſixth, a basket of Flowers and Fruits.</p>
                  <p>Being all thus before her, cloſe to the Altar of Veſta, before which ſhe did proſtrate her
ſelfe upon her knees; ſhe began an Antheme in praiſe of that Goddeſſe, and all the Veſtals
joyned with her: and having ſung the firſt verſe, they all roſe up, having each of them
a Taper in their hands, and walked two and two. The youngeſt went firſt, the elder next,
and afterwards the ſix which carried the Chaplets of Flowers: laſt of all, the chiefe Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall
with her Paſtorall ſtaffe, and all the reſt went about the Altar: Then every one went
to their places againe, except the chiefe Veſtall, and thoſe that carried things neceſſary for
the ſacrifice: Then ſhe who carried the bundle of Vervine, laid it down on the left hand of
the Altar, where the fire was kept in day and night by two Veſtals, becauſe if it went out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53527:10"/>
they thought ſome great diſaſter would befall them. If ever the fire did extinguiſh, the
Veſtal that kept it was ſeverely puniſhed: then they kindled it againe with the rayes of
the Sun, which fire they eſteemed Sacred. The other Veſtal, who carried the Flowers and
the fruits, did put them into the white Marble Ark, of which we ſpoke before; and the
other four ſtayed with the chiefe Veſtal, who then proſtrating her ſelfe before the Altar,
did with a loud voice confeſſe her ſinnes; then acknowledged that ſhe durſt not approach
the ſacred Altar of that Goddeſſe, being ſo defiled with ſinnes; and that ſhe was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to offer any thing that was pleaſing unto her, unleſſe it was by her commandment.
Afterwards approaching nearer, ſhe ſtrewed the Altar all over with perfumes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,
which caſt a fragrant ſmell all over the Temple. Then turning her ſelfe towards the
Eaſt, ſhe uttered in a diſtinct voice, ſome words which a Veſtal repeated unto her word
by word, reading them out of a Book, for fear of miſſing, or bad pronunciation; for
ſhould any miſtake fall out in them, they believe that the ſacrifices are not pleaſing unto
the Goddeſs.</p>
                  <p>The words are theſe,
<q>O Moſt renowned Goddeſs, Daughter of Great <hi>Rhea,</hi> and puiſſant <hi>Saturn,</hi> Veſta, whom
the <hi>Thirrians</hi> do call <hi>Labith Horchia;</hi> Receive we beſeech thee this devout Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which we offer unto unto thee for the people and Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Gaules, and for the Grandure and proſperity of <hi>Amaſis</hi> our Soveraign Lady. Let
the Sacred Fire which thou haſt committed unto our keeping, never extinguiſh: And let
thy requeſt which after the victory obtained over the <hi>Titans,</hi> thou madeſt unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
to be ſtill a Virgin, be alſo obtained for us, and that we being all thine, we may be eſteemed
part of thy ſelfe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the laſt words of this ſupplication, all the Virgins anſwered, Amen. Afterwards
every one threw into the fire ſome Incenſe and Aromatique drugs; then the chief Veſtall
taking ſome of the ſacred water, ſhe ſprinkled the flowers, the fruits, and the fire with it:
All theſe things being done, ſhe went a little from the Altar, and began a Hymn in praiſe
of the Goddeſſe, and all the Veſtals, as a Chorus joyned with her. Laſtly, one, who
ſtood oppoſite to the chiefe Veſtal, pronounced in a loud voice, That it was permitted
them to depart; and ſo the ſacrifice ended.</p>
                  <p>Then the venerable <hi>Chryſante,</hi> who medled not with the Sacrifices, but onely as an
aſſiſtant; ſhe went out of the Temple, and all the reſt, except the Veſtals; and went into
the ſacred Grove, where the Prophets and the Shepheards waited for them: the one ſort,
to ſacrifice; but the other, as much out of devotion to the ſhepheardeſſes, as unto their great
Tautates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hylas</hi> more impatient then any elſe, out of his zealous deſire to ſee the faire <hi>Alexis,</hi> he
was conſtrained to be preſent at the ſacrifice of the Prophets; but his prayer was, that
Tautates would be pleaſed this once, to be contented with ſhort Ceremonies, that he
might be going his deſired viſit: and indeed as ſoon as the laſt word of the ſacrifice was
pronounced, he roſe up, and forced all the company to doe the like. He was as haſty alſo
when dinner was done; for ſeeing the venerable <hi>Chryſante</hi> fall into diſcourſe. Madam,
ſaid he, and interrupted her, If you do not give order for our departure, ſome of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
intends to leave you, and go unto the fair <hi>Alexis. Phillis</hi> anſwering for the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Chryſante;</hi> what a ſcurvie humour are you in <hi>Hylas</hi> (ſaid ſhe) to be weary with being
in this place? where do you think to find better company? My late Miſtreſſe, anſwered
he, Did I love you as I do <hi>Alexis,</hi> and you not here, I ſhould tell you in anſwer to your
queſtion, that the beſt company was where you were: but ſince the caſe is altered, I muſt
tell you upon the ſame reaſon, that where <hi>Alexis</hi> is, there is the beſt company for me. And
to make my words good by my actions, if you do not go juſt now, you ſhall have no
more of the company of <hi>Hylas,</hi> Upon this, making a low reverence, he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be gone, when all the company flocked about him, and would have ſtayed him
by force. Whileſt he was ſtriving to eſcape their hands, a Meſſenger came unto <hi>Chryſante</hi>
from <hi>Amaſis,</hi> who ſent word, that ſhe would come and lie at her houſe the ſame night,
that ſhe might the next morning ſacrifice unto the Gods, by reaſon of a ſtrange Dreame
which ſhe had. This meſſage cauſed <hi>Hylas</hi> to be hotter upon his departure, then before:
and ſeeing that the venerable <hi>Chryſante</hi> could not go, his importunity was ſuch, that the
fair ſhepheardeſſes were forced to go away ſooner then otherwiſe they would: <hi>Aſtrea</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53527:10"/>
was very deſirous of haſte in going, though her diſcretion did hanſomely diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it, which <hi>Hylas</hi> and his free humour could not. Having therefore taken their
leave, they ſet forward, accompanied with the kind ſhepheards; and becauſe the Paths
were in ſome places very narrow, every one did undertake the conduct of her who was
moſt agreeable to his fancy, except <hi>Silvander,</hi> who out of reſpect was forced to quit
<hi>Diana</hi> unto <hi>Paris;</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> had deſired <hi>Phillis</hi> not to be farre from her, leſt <hi>Paris</hi>
ſhould fall into diſcourſe of his affection: <hi>Phillis</hi> therefore took <hi>Diana</hi> by the other arm,
and mixed diſcourſe amongſt them, ſeeming as if without deſign.</p>
                  <p>It happened, that being come out of the Wood, and having paſſed over <hi>Lignon,</hi> at the
bridge of <hi>Botereux,</hi> the way was ſo broad that many might goe abreſt: <hi>Phillis</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>Lycidas</hi> unto her; and ſeeing that <hi>Silvander</hi> was conſtrained to entertaine
<hi>Hylas; Silvander,</hi> ſaid ſhe, (purpoſely to interrupt <hi>Paris</hi>) pray give me your opinion:
which of us two hath the better place? I think anſwered the Shepherd, that this which
I have long had is the beſt; you muſt have very good reaſons (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>) if you can
make me beleeve it; and your affection is very cold, if you thinke ſo: yet it is true (ſaid
<hi>Silvander</hi>) though not beleeved, ſo as, whatſoever you thinke of my place or affection
to <hi>Diana,</hi> I would not change with you; for as ſure as you are <hi>Phillis,</hi> my place is
better then yours: I have heard ſaid <hi>Philis,</hi> that the neerer one is to the party loved, the
more is the Lover contented; you have heard the truth, replyed <hi>Silvander;</hi> You ſee,
ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that I am neere <hi>Diana,</hi> and you are at a great diſtance: For all that, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
hee, I am neerer to her then you are; for you are only by her ſide, and I am
in her heart. I ſhall no longer be ſorry for the paines you take in walking (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>)
for now I ſee it is <hi>Diana</hi> that gives you ſtrength to make long journeys without wearying
your thighs. <hi>Silvander</hi> ſmiled at the anſwer, and replyed: I know <hi>Hylas</hi> that you doe
not underſtand what I ſay; nor indeed is it to you that I ſpeake, but unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> who,
the truth is, I find to be ignorant enough in the myſteries of love; but yet ſhe is willing to
learne, ſo as ſhe doth better deſerve to heare me than you doe. If <hi>Phillis</hi> deſire to be
a Schollar in the Schoole of love (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) and will follow my documents, I ſhall
make her an excellent Artiſt. Every one laughed at <hi>Hylas,</hi> and becauſe <hi>Silvander</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> looked downe with their eyes, he would change diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
therefore ſaid unto him: I perceive <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you are very liberall of your
Doctrine, but to returne unto what I ſpoke unto <hi>Phillis;</hi> I ſay againe that I am neerer
<hi>Diana</hi> then ſhe is, though ſhe ſtand cloſe by her ſide, becauſe <hi>Diana</hi> is in my heart:
you ſaid, replyed <hi>Phillis</hi> preſently, that you were in her heart. I ſay it againe, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Silvander;</hi> beleeve it, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> there is a great deal of difference; for if you doe love
<hi>Diana,</hi> it may be ſaid that ſhe is in your heart; and if <hi>Diana</hi> love you, then it may be
ſaid that you are in hers. After the common and vulgarſpeech, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> it may
be ſo underſtood; but amongſt perſons of underſtanding, the one may be taken for the
other: for to be in any place, is to be underſtood two wayes: The one, when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is in a place, and then the outſide is in onely there; the other is, when the ſoul which
is all ſpirit, doth hover in any place, as mine doth in the heart of <hi>Diana;</hi> for a ſoule lives
more where it loves, then where it breaths,: To live, is an immediate act of the ſoule;
it followes therefore, that if I love <hi>Diana,</hi> I am really in her: it is alſo a common phraſe
to ſay, My heart is there, though my body be here: This, anſwered <hi>Phillis</hi> is a little
too obſcure for me: but by all this you onely prove that your ſoule is there, and not
<hi>Silvander,</hi> and therefore my place is the better: for one part of me at the leſt, and that
which is moſt apt for paſſion, the body is neerer her then you are. I confeſſe, anſwered he,
that in body you are neerer then I am, but you cannot conclude by it that your place is
better, becauſe the ſoule is ſo much ſuperiour to the body, as there is no compariſon
betwixt them. I wiſh withall my heart Shepheard (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that we two were both
in love with one Shepheardeſſe: for ſince you contemne the body, I would willingly
take it for my ſhare, and leave the ſoule freely to you, though it were the moſt learned
ſoule among all our Druids: As for example, leave the body of <hi>Alexis</hi> to me, and I
will leave the ſoule of <hi>Adamas</hi> unto you, who is a very knowing man. Every one did
laugh at this propoſition, unto which <hi>Silvander</hi> anſwered thus: If all things be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
according to their true merit, certainly your choiſe is not the beſt: For the body
which you only love, is an object unworthy of the ſoules love, becauſe love ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
adde ſome perfection unto the Lover; for it is confeſſed by all, that love is a deſire
of ſomething which is wanting. Alas the body is unworthy of the ſoul's love, becauſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53527:11"/>
it is vile and baſe, and much below it; ſuch <hi>Hylas,</hi> as love onely the body, are <hi>Pigmalion-like,</hi>
who fell in love with a peece of Marble: Nature it ſelfe is very repugnant to it,
and you will confeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it, <hi>Hylas,</hi> when I aske you this Queſtion. If <hi>Alexis</hi> were dead,
would you then love her body? To which <hi>Hylas</hi> making no anſwer; I ſee you are mute
truth hath ſilenced you, or elſe you are aſhamed of a bad opinion. Neither the one, nor
the other (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) but what ſhould I anſwer? Doe you thinke I can divine? <hi>I</hi>
can give you an accompt of things paſt if I can remember them, and of things preſent
when I know them; but as for things future, good Friend, who doe you take me for:
Doe you thinke I had one of the Sibils to my Tutor, or that I was brought up at the
ſchoole of Prediction? Good <hi>Silvander,</hi> if you diſcourſe with me, talke of things
within compaſſe of mans capacity, and let the ſecrets of the Gods alone: leave things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
unto them, they have reſerved them unto themſelves. If you aske whether I doe
love the body of <hi>Alexis:</hi> I anſwer you, that I do; but if you aske me what I would doe
if the body had not a ſoule, I muſt ſend you to ſuch as can foretell things; you may
take them along with you, if you will upon an errand to the Deſtinies, and when you
returne, I ſhall enquire of you what I ſhall doe then: but in the meane time I will love
the body of the faire <hi>Alexis,</hi> not as ſhe will be a hundred yeares hence, but as ſhe is
now at this preſent, the moſt perfect workmanſhip of the gods.</p>
                  <p>Thus talked <hi>Hylas,</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> would have replyed, when all the Company came
to a narrow planke, where every ſhepheard was officiouſly carefull to helpe his ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe
over; and when they were all on the other ſide, <hi>Silvander</hi> offered to fall into
diſcourſe againe, but <hi>Diana</hi> hindred him, becauſe hearing a ſhepheard and a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe
ſinging, ſhe deſired him to liſten. All the Company turned their eyes to the
place from whence the voice came, and drawing a little neerer, they ſaw a ſhepheardeſſe
ſitting under a ſhady Tree, and a ſhepheard upon his knees before her, courting her, and
ſhe returning him very diſdainfull anſwers. Enough, enough <hi>Alcidon</hi> (ſaid ſhe) if
you will have me to ſtay any longer here, either be ſilent, or talke of ſomething elſe;
and beleeve it, that whatſoever you ſay upon this ſubject, will onely increaſe my diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to you. If I had not more hope (anſwered hee) in the juſtice of love, then in
yours, I ſhould long ſince, not onely have ceaſed talking, but ceaſed living. What
can your hopes be, ſaid <hi>Daphnide?</hi> for if the God of whom you ſpeake were juſt, he
would long ſince have made you an example unto all ſuch as are ſo bold as to offer
wrong? Doe not offend him (ſaid <hi>Alcidon</hi>) who hath power to order things according
to his will, and of whoſe power you cannot be ſo ignorant, as to thinke that you
ought to ſcorne me as you doe: The ſhepheardeſſe would have replyed, had not the
company been ſo neer, as cauſed her to be ſilent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and the reſt of the Company, who heard theſe ſtrangers, being invited by
the beauty of the ſhepheardeſſe, and the hanſome deportment of the Shepheard, as well
to ſatiſfi their curioſity, as their duty, unto which the lawes of hoſpitality did oblige
them, which were moſt religiouſly obſerved in that Country; they addreſſed themſelves
unto the ſhepheardeſſe, and after ſalutation, offered her and all her company, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of aſſiſtance; for at the ſame time there came unto her two other ſhepheardeſſes and
a ſhepheard, who had ſtrayed from them, and ſtayed under a ſhade untill the heat of
the day was a little over. <hi>Daphnide,</hi> ſeeing this faire Company accoaſt her with ſuch
courteous expreſſions, ſhe anſwered with all poſſible civility, and told them all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
that the Heavens had beene moſt gracious unto the Country, being inhabited
by perſons ſo accompliſhed with all manner of merits. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> made anſwer thus; There
is not any here who is not very much devoted unto your ſervice, as well in obedience
to our Lawes which command us to be hoſpitable unto Strangers, as out of deſire to
have the honour of doing ſervice unto perſons of ſo much merit as you and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.
Since my firſt encounter is ſo good (ſaid the Stranger) I begin to hope for a
happy concluſion in my voyage: And ſince your courteous offers doe imbolden me
to enquire of what is neceſſary to be known; I beſeech you fair ſhepheardeſſe tell me, if
there be not a Fountaine in this Country, which is called the Fountaine of Loves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and where it is? <hi>Aſtrea</hi> looked upon <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> and returned no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
which canſed <hi>Silvander</hi> to anſwer for her. Faire ſhepheardeſſe (ſaid he) the
Fountaine of which you enquire is in this Country; bnt love hath ſo ordered it that upon
the matter it is not here, being guarded by ſuch inchanted Animals, as there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
unto it: And where is it, replyed <hi>Aſtrea?</hi> How, ſaid the Stranger, are you of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53527:11"/>
this Country, and ignorant of a thing ſo rare? It is almoſt incredible: Thoſe who ſee
your face which is ſo faire, cannot chuſe but love you, and by conſequence you cannot but
be ſo curious as to know the truth of their affections who love you, which as I have
heard ſay; may be ſeen in this fountain. I know, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and bluſht a little, that it
is your Complement which makes you ſpeake ſo advantagiouſly of my face, and nothing
elſe, therefore I will not anſwer unto that. But as for that curioſity which you thinke is
in me; firſt, I have no occaſion for it, becauſe I was never ſo happy as to be loved in that
manner: and ſecondly, we never uſe to have recourſe unto the Fountaine you ſpeake of,
to know the mindes of thoſe who ſerve us, becauſe we have a better, and more ſure way.
What is that, I beſeech you, (ſaid the ſtranger). It is, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> Time, and the effects
of it. I do conceive, ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> that this way is very uncertaine; and I my ſelfe can
ſay, that I have been often deceived by it.</p>
                  <p>If that do faile us (replyed <hi>Diana</hi>) then we doe uſe another remedy: What is that, ſaid
the ſtranger? It is, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> not to love at all. That remedy, ſaid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> is
moſt unjuſt, for thereby the innocent will be puniſhed, and not the culpable. For he
who deceives any ſhepheardeſſe, in faigning to love her, cares not whether ſhe love him
or no, and ſo receives no puniſhment for his fault: and he who does really love her, bears
all the blame and puniſhment. You ſee, generous ſhepheard (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that our ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes
are as unjuſt as faire; and yet for all that, we can't chuſe but love them; what
then ſhould we do, if their minds were as ſweet as their faces?</p>
                  <p>One of the ſhepheardeſſes hearing <hi>Hylas</hi> ſpeak thus, began to fix her eyes upon him,
thinking that ſhe ſhould know him. And doubtleſſe, but for his habit which did a little
diſguiſe him, ſhe had not ſtood ſo long in doubt; but after ſhe had a little better conſidered
with her ſelfe, ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe unto <hi>Thameres,</hi> and asked him in a low voice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that ſhepheard who ſpoke, was not <hi>Hylas,</hi> and he anſwering, yes; ſhe whiſpered
<hi>Daphnide</hi> in the eare, and ſaid unto her, Madam, he whom you ſpake unto, is <hi>Hylas,</hi> and
you know him not: The ſtranger bluſhed; and holding her hand before her face, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſhamed to be ſeen in that habit, went back a pace or two, crying out, Oh heavens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>Hylas,</hi> how your habit alters you, and perhaps mine alters me as much: Then <hi>Hylas</hi>
coming nearer her, he looked ſeriouſly upon her, ſo as though he had not ſeen her of a
long time; and though her habit had much changed her, yet he knew her to be <hi>Daphnide,</hi>
eſteemed the faireſt Lady in all <hi>Arles,</hi> or the Roman Provinces; but he was ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
at the ſight of her, that he knew not whether he dreamed or waked. At the laſt,
after a long pauſe, he went back, looked upon her, and was not able to ſpeake one word:
which the ſtranger perceiving. Certainly, ſaid ſhe, This is a Country of wonders; for <hi>I</hi>
find in it ſhepheardeſſes more civilized, than any perſons in Cities: Naturall beauties,
without any artifice; and the greateſt wonder of all is, to ſee <hi>Hylas</hi> ſilent. <hi>Hylas</hi> turned
towards her, and knew her that ſpoke unto him, to be <hi>Carlis,</hi> the other <hi>Stiliana,</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthe,</hi>
with them: this ſight did ſo amaze him, that not able to ſpeake a word, he ran
to embrace his deare friend <hi>Hermanthe;</hi> and after a long embracement, he parted, and
imbraced againe; have I met with my dear <hi>Hermanthe?</hi> (ſaid he) Is it poſſible I ſhould
find here the greateſt beauties in all the Province of the <hi>Romans?</hi> I might have ſaid the
whole world, if this Country in which we are were excepted. What? The ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
<hi>Daphnide;</hi> the proud <hi>Stiliana,</hi> and <hi>Carlis,</hi> who firſt taught me to love? The Gods
have been abundantly favorable to me, in conducting you hither: Madam (ſaid he
unto <hi>Daphnide</hi>) you, and your company, are come to be witneſſes of my Glory and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
<hi>Hylas,</hi> anſwered the ſtranger, you enjoy no contentment, but I do participate in it
as your friend: but if you wonder to ſee me in this equipage, I do no leſſe, to ſee you
thus diſguiſed, and in a place where I had no thoughts of finding you: however, I doe
thinke the encounter moſt happy, if it will make me any ſharer in the Glory and Felicity
which you enjoy. Madam, ſaid <hi>Carlis,</hi> he nevers offers any ſigne of joy for meeting with
me, or with <hi>Stiliana.</hi> Oh my firſt Miſtreſſe (ſaid he) why do you think ſo? you know
that ones firſt love is never forgotten. But you ſhew the contrary (ſaid ſhe) for love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, when the party loved is forgotten; and you cannot deny, but that you had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
us all. I am compounded of another mettal (ſaid he) then other lovers are; for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
uſe to forget thoſe whom I ever loved; nor is my affection to them extinguiſhed. 'Tis
true, my memory will ſometimes ſtumble, and be covered over with oblivion, as fire
will be in the embers, and my affections will ſlacken as a bow that hath been too long
bent; but my memory will get up againe: blow but the ashes from the embers, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53527:12"/>
the fire will be in; and the bow after a little unbending, will aſſume its firſt ſtrength; even
ſo will my memory, and my affection, when the aſhes of oblivion are blown away, by
the fight or preſence of the party loved. I perceive, ſaid <hi>Stiliana,</hi> that <hi>Hylas</hi> is ſtill <hi>Hylas
I</hi> hope (ſaid <hi>Daphnide</hi>) that we ſhall have leiſure to know further of your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare;
but in the meane time, leſt we ſhould commit ſome errors amongſt theſe fair ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes,
<hi>I</hi> pray <hi>Hylas</hi> tell us who they are, and whether <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> be in the
company. Madam, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> they are both there; and then he ſhewed them unto
her; then <hi>Daphnide</hi> ſaluted them againe; and after ſhe had well looked upon them,
Fame I perceive (ſaid ſhe) has undervalued the truth; for I ſee your beauty goes beyond
all reports. Madam, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and bluſht, thoſe that live as we do, may ſay, that
they are hardly in the world; for living onely in woods and fields, fame can take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of us, and we think our ſelves very happy in her ſilence. You may ſay what you pleaſe,
replyed <hi>Daphnide;</hi> but now I have ſeen you, I am able to ſay, and truly, that though
fame ſhould ſpeak highly in your advantage, yet ſhe both is, and would be ſarre ſhort of
the truth, and do you wrong. Madam, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> it is onely your ſweet civility which
is pleaſed to beſtow theſe attributes upon us: And though we are, as my companion ſaith,
almoſt out of the world: yet would we gladly be ſuch as you are pleaſed to ſay we are;
for perfection is deſireable in all. You cannot deſire more then you have; replyed the
ſtranger; for if you ſhould, your deſires would be above the power of Nature: and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe it poſſible, ſhe ſhould make two different beauties more perfect, How, Madam,
ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> though they be ſuch as you ſay they are, yet I was never in love with them,
or ſo little, as it may be termed nothing. All birds, anſwered <hi>Daphnide,</hi> are not pleaſed
with the pure light of the Sun, nor by conſequence, your bad ſight with theſe great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Nay, nay, Madam, replyed he, It is rather becauſe there are greater beauties in this
Country then they are, and you know <hi>Hylas</hi> was ever a lover of the faireſt. I can very
hardly believe what you ſay, anſwered the ſtranger. I ſhall make you confeſſe it, ſaid he,
if you will goe whether all this company are going: Diſcreet ſhepheardeſſes (continued
he, and turned towards <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi>) know that you ſee here in the habit of a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe
and ſhepheard, the faireſt Lady, and moſt generous Cavalier in all the Province
of <hi>Galloligures;</hi> and I believe your Country never received a greater favour from heaven,
then in receiving them therefore Noble <hi>Paris,</hi> I beſeech you let them not depart from
this company, until <hi>Adamas</hi> have ſeen them at his houſe. <hi>Paris</hi> and the ſhepheardeſſes
addreſſing themſelves unto <hi>Daphnide,</hi> did excuſe themſelves for not rendring them that
honour which was their due; and beſeeched them to favour the great <hi>Druid</hi> ſo far, as to
viſit his houſe; which they conſented unto, as well to ſatisfie the requeſt of <hi>Paris</hi> and the
ſhepheardeſſes, as out of their deſire to ſpeak with ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> about ſome affairs which
brought them unto that place, having heard very much of his wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hylas</hi> was very glad when they conſented; and becauſe <hi>Daphnide</hi> knew him in the

many queſtions unto him by the way, unto which the ſhepheardeſſes would ſometimes
anſwer for him, and ſometimes <hi>Silvander:</hi> And though he was in a little kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
before <hi>Daphnide, Stiliana,</hi> and <hi>Carlis:</hi> yet he could not chuſe but break out often
in his anſwers, eſpecially when <hi>Silvander</hi> ſpake: at which theſe ſtrangers did ſo laugh,
that addreſſing himſelfe unto <hi>Daphnide:</hi> Madam, ſaid he unto her, I think, that in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon you the habit of theſe ſhepheardeſſes, you have alſo taken their humour,
ſince this ſhepheard's talk does pleaſe you ſo very well: for he never opens his mouth to
contradict me, but preſently all fall a laughing. But my good friend <hi>Silvander</hi> (ſaid
he, and turned towards him) you muſt know, that it is at you whom this Lady laughs,
and not at me; for thy education being onely Rurall, thou ſpeakeſt accordingly: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>I</hi> think thy beſt diſcretion is, to talk no longer. Courteous ſhepheard, ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi>
do not believe <hi>Hylas,</hi> you do not know him ſo well as I do; but I ſhould be very ſorry
you ſhould have any ſuch opinion of me. Madam, anſwered <hi>Silvander, Hylas</hi> and <hi>I</hi>
have often ſuch conteſts as theſe, and never believe each other. But <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid he, and
turned towards him, do not miſtake your ſelfe, for I do know before whom I ſpeak, and
know this Lady.</p>
                  <p>I had ſpent my time very ill amongſt the <hi>Maſſilians,</hi> and had been both deafe and
blind, if I had not heard of her merit, and ſeen her beauty: I know, <hi>Hylas,</hi> and perhaps
better then you do, who the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> is, who <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and who is the great and
renowned King <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53527:12"/>
the <hi>Maſſilians</hi> and of <hi>Arles,</hi> then many others; and therefore though I am a ſhepheard
doe not think to daunt me with your big words. <hi>Daphnide</hi> then interpoſed; truly, ſaid
ſhe, I doe beleeve this ſhepheard knowes me, and I beleeve what he ſayes, and alſo <hi>I</hi>
beleeve he knowes more then you thinke he doth. But kind ſhepheard (ſaid ſhe unto
<hi>Silvander</hi>) if it will not be too much trouble unto you, tell us how you came to know
all theſe things? Madam, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> I was along time in the <hi>Maſſilian</hi> ſchools
where your Name was ſo cryed up by the <hi>Bardi,</hi> that every one did hear of it. How came
you now to be in the habit of a ſhepheard (ſaid ſhe) and what cauſe doth retaine you
in it? Fortune, ſaid he, brought me into this Country, and Love ſtayes me in it.
And ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> Love brought me into this Country, and <hi>Alexis</hi> ſtayes me in it.
Who is that happy <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſaid ſhe, (and ſmiled) She is one, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> who will make
you bluſh for ſhame, and grow pale with envie: ſhe is ſo faire, that ſhe hath no equall.
<hi>Aylas,</hi> anſwered ſhe, you ſay ſo much that I muſt needs beleeve you in part, and too
much to be beleeved in all; your owne eyes (ſaid he) will be witneſſes preſently againſt
your ſelfe, and will enforce you to juſtifie all my words; for I have not ſpoke one ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
too much in her Commendations. <hi>Alcidon</hi> hearing this, thought himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned:
<hi>Hylas</hi> (ſaid he) I will acknowledge your Miſtreſſe to be faire, but that ſhe is
fairer then <hi>Daphnide,</hi> if words will not maintaine the contrary, my blood and life ſhall.
<hi>Hylas</hi> hearing this, aſſumed a very ſerious looke; as farre as words will goe, ſaid he,
<hi>I</hi> will maintaine what <hi>I</hi> ſay; but if you come to matter of blood and life, <hi>I</hi> will not
onely quit her unto you, but unto any that ſhall maintaine the contrary; for my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
is talking not killing: every one began ſo to laugh at this anſwer, that <hi>Alcidon</hi>
could not reply of a long time after.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſſe their diſcourſe had continued longer, if they had not been very neer the
houſe of <hi>Adamas.</hi> In the meane time <hi>Alexis</hi> in contemplation of that contentment
which ſhe promiſed unto her ſelfe in the ſight of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> did ſtand leaning againſt a
window which looked towards the Plaine, and talked with <hi>Leonide.</hi> When ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the company comming, and aſſured her ſelfe that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was amongſt them, ſhe
ſtarted: ſometimes ſhe looked upon one, and ſometimes upon another ſhepheardeſſe;
but when ſhe ſpyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> oh, into what an extaſie ſhe was tranſported! ſhe fixed her
eye upon her, and ſpoke not a word, as if ſhe would take her fill of that pleaſing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
At laſt fetching a deepe ſigh, ſhe ſhewed her unto <hi>Leonide</hi> with her finger; ſee,
ſee, ſaid ſhe, the faireſt ſight in the whole world, being as bad almoſt in that rapture,
as <hi>Adraſtes</hi> was. Then keeping ſilence a while, ſhe went a pace or two backe from
the window, and folding her armes upon her breſt: Oh heavens (ſaid ſhe) how dare
<hi>I</hi> preſent my ſelf before her, when ſhe hath commanded me the contrary? What, ſaid
<hi>Leonide</hi> will you relaps into your old errour? Were not theſe conſiderations ſufficiently
debated with <hi>Adamas</hi> before you came hither? have you ſo ſoone forgotten his prudent
reaſons? Doe not thinke (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) that I have forgotten them, but I am ſure
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> will ſee me, and I ſhall ſee her, ſhe will ſpeake unto me, and I unto her, and is
not this diſobedience to her Command? Goe, goe, (ſaid ſhee unto me, I ſhall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
thoſe cruell words) goe diſloyall man, and never come in my ſight unleſſe I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mmand
thee. The Nymph thinking that if this diſcourſe went on, it would much
diſquiet <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſhe would not anſwer unto her; only thus, theſe thoughts <hi>Alexis</hi>
muſt not now come into your mind; it is already reſolved upon, the time is now
come wherein you muſt ſhew your ſelfe a man, Sonne to <hi>Alcippes,</hi> whoſe courage was
ſo highly eſteemed by every one; you muſt I ſay change your Countenance and Garbe;
you muſt receive <hi>Aſtrea</hi> without any wonder, and at the firſt accoaſt of her, have ſo
much power over your ſelfe, that none may diſcover you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you know that the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
take deepeſt roote, and upon them the moſt ſure judgement is built; therefore
reſolve with your ſelfe ſo to diſguiſe the matter, that thoſe whom your habit deludes
may not be undeceived by your actions. Ah Madam (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) how eaſie a matter
it is for thoſe that are well to give counſell unto the ſicke? here is a fault committed
already replyed <hi>Leonide;</hi> why doe you call me Madam, and not Siſter; you know
<hi>Adamas</hi> will needs have me call <hi>Paris</hi> Brother, and ſo he commands me to call you
Siſter, and if you doe not the like you will be ſuſpected, you know that your face does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
reſemble <hi>Celadon,</hi> and therefore you muſt uſe abundance of Art to deceive peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Siſter, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſince you are pleaſed I ſhould call you ſo, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to carry my ſelfe as well as I can; but I aſſure you never was any, more put to it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53527:13"/>
then your miſerable Siſter is upon this occaſion, and unleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e ſome helpe me out I know
not how I ſhall delude the eyes of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> with whom I never uſed any diſſimulation
or diſguiſement. Upon ſuch occaſions as theſe, ſaid the Nymph we muſt make our wit
and courage appeare, and as they ſay make a vertue of neceſſity. Aſſure your ſelfe, the
Authority of <hi>Adamas</hi> is ſo great, and every one hath ſuch an opinion of his
Wiſedome, that with a little helpe of your own, none will queſtion but that you
are his daughter.</p>
                  <p>As they were thus talking, <hi>Adamas</hi> being advertiſed of the coming of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he
came to hearten <hi>Alexis,</hi> which was no ſmall Prudence; for ſhe was ſo much out of
her ſelfe, that good preparatives were but neceſſary, leaſt ſhe being ſurpriſed ſhe might
give too much knowledge who ſhe was. When they were in the midſt of their diſcourſe,
newes was brought them that all the Company was come in, to the firſt Court of the
Caſtle. <hi>Alexis</hi> bluſht, and her legs trembled ſo, that ſhe was conſtrained to fit downe.
<hi>Leonide</hi> who perceived it, the better to hide all faults, told <hi>Adamas</hi> that it was good to
draw the Curtains of the windowes, and to let in as little light as might be, that the
alterations in the face of <hi>Alexis</hi> might not be diſcerned, and that the pretence for it
might be to hinder the Sunne from keeping the roome too hot. The Druide liking
the Counſell, commanded all the Curtaines to be drawne: But as they were buſie in
preparing all things on the one ſide, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was as much perplexed on the other: her
heart did beat extreamly, and coming unto <hi>Phillis</hi> ſaid to her in her eare: Good Siſter
find ſome excuſe or other out, which may cauſe us to ſtay a little; for I muſt confeſſe
that my hopes to ſee the face of <hi>Celadon</hi> in <hi>Alexis,</hi> does ſo much put mee out of my
ſelfe, as I feare, that if I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve not a little time to recollect my ſelfe, I ſhall give too much
knowledge of what I deſire to conceale, eſpecially unto theſe Strangers. Upon this,
<hi>Phillis</hi> went unto <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and ſaid unto her: Are you not weary Madam with walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Hill? If it be your pleaſure, I am ſure all the company would be very glad
to take a little breath before they goe up into the Hall. For my part (ſaid <hi>Daphnide</hi>) <hi>I</hi>
like the motion very well, but would not propound it leaſt I ſhould diſpleaſe. <hi>Hylas</hi>
who could not indure to be retarded from his contentment in ſeeing his deare <hi>Alexis;</hi>
Madam, ſaid he, if you were not in very good company I ſhould not offer to leave you;
but ſince you are, I beſeech you take it not ill, if I goe before, and tell them that you
are coming; for I had rather take breath with <hi>Alexis,</hi> than here. Then not ſtaying
for any, nor for the anſwer of <hi>Daohnide,</hi> he went up the ſtaires, at the top of which, and
at the entrance into the Hall, he met <hi>Adamas, Leonide</hi> and <hi>Alexis:</hi> and becauſe all
three of them did thinke that the love of <hi>Hylas</hi> would be an excellent umbrage of what
they deſired to conceale, they made him as welcome as they could: The Druid
himſelfe, after he had ſaluted him, ſmilingly ſaid, that it was eaſie to ſee who of all the
Company was moſt their friend: Sir, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> if the haſte which I have made in
coming firſt, move you to thinke ſo well of me, my ſtaying the laſt will be as good a
teſtimony of my good will, and I wiſh my company were as welcome unto you, and
your company as it is deſired by me. No queſtion but it is, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> is it not, Siſter?
For my part, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> I am very much contented in it: <hi>Hylas</hi> then going neerer
her: Fair <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſaid he, in a low voice, ſo my company yeeld you any contentment, it
is enough: Why, (ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſeeming to be angry) doe you ſo little eſteeme the reſt
of the company? I aſſure you proud Shepheard, I will be revenged of you, and before
the day be done, you ſhall repent of your diſdaining me thus: ſhe uttered theſe words
with an angry looke, and did very well feign a diſcontented perſon. But <hi>Hylas,</hi> who
naturally did not care for any woman living, unleſſe her he loved I ſhall be very ſorry, ſaid
he, when the faire <hi>Alexis</hi> repents of what ſhe hath ſaid unto me: and till then, you will
but loſe your labour, if you ſeek for any revenge upon me: And when ſhe doth repent
of it, you need not ſeeke for any greater revenge, for my ſorrowes will be ſo great, that
nothing can make them greater. Servant, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> as long as you

                  <p>He was ready to reply, when <hi>Adamas</hi> interrupted and asked him, who were thoſe
ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſſes which were coming. There is, Father, ſaid he, <hi>Aſtrea,
Diana, Phillis,</hi> and ſeverall others of that neighbourhood: There are alſo ſome ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
as <hi>Florice, Cyrcenea,</hi> and their Company; but that which invited me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

before, was to tell you, that we met by the way with faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> a Lady of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53527:13"/>
higheſt eſteem of any in the Roman Province, and with the generous <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed
in the habit of ſhepheards, are come into this Country to ſeek for the Fountaine of
loves verity: <hi>Alcidon</hi> is the moſt beloved Cavalier in all the Province, eſpecially by the
great <hi>Eurick:</hi> And thus you ſee I am not the onely ſtranger, who diſguiſeth my ſelf in the
habit of a ſhepherd, to live happily in your Country. <hi>Adamas</hi> anſwered him; Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
it ſhould be the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> with whom the great <hi>Euricke,</hi> King of the <hi>Viſigots</hi>
was in love? and <hi>Hylas</hi> anſwering him, that ſhe was the ſame, he continued; though <hi>I</hi>
never ſaw her, yet I ſhall know her, for I have a Picture which they aſſure me, does very
much reſemble her, except her habit do cauſe an alteration: yet I will ſeem to know
nothing, and will bid all our ſhepherdeſſes as welcome as I can.</p>
                  <p>Their diſcourſe had continued longer, had they not been prevented by the coming of
the Company: for <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> although ſhe was the cauſe of their ſtay, yet ſhe was not able
any longer to ſtay from the ſight of that ſo much loved face; therefore ſhe made ſign unto
<hi>Phillis,</hi> who underſtanding her meaning, addreſſed her ſelfe unto <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi>
and ſaid unto them aloud: Now if it pleaſe you, it is full time to follow <hi>Hylas;</hi> for what
will <hi>Adamas</hi> think, when he heares by him that we are here? 'Tis true, ſaid <hi>Daphnide;</hi> and
taking <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> by each hand, they led the way, and the ſtaires being very large,
they went up all three a breſt, and the reſt of the company confuſedly followed after. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas</hi>
waited for them in the entry of the great Chamber, where he received them as
kindly as poſſibly he could: and ſeeming not to know <hi>Daphnide</hi> nor <hi>Alcidon,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
his ſpeech unto the ſhepheards of his acquaintance, and ſaid unto them with a
ſmiling countenance: Faire ſhepheardeſſes, you give me ſome cauſe to think that you are
proud, becauſe you ſeem to ſleight your Neighbours: has my Daughter been thus long
here, and you not daign one courteous viſit? <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who obſerved, that though he ſpoke
to all in generall, yet he addreſſed his ſpeech particularly unto her, ſhe made anſwer for
all. Revere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

retarded, though every particular deſires to make haſte: This excuſe, ſaid <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
will hardly hold; for methinkes every one of you in particular, does owe me as much
friendſhip, as I doe owe you all in generall. Then <hi>Diana</hi> undertook the matter; Father,
ſaid ſhe, and ſmiled, many had rather give that which they do not owe, then pay their
due debts: but as we have committed this fault, ſo are we puniſhed for it, in depriving
our ſelves ſo long, from that which is ſo great a happineſſe unto us: Upon this, <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
addreſſed her ſelfe to ſalute <hi>Leonide,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> the like unto the diſguiſed <hi>Alexis:</hi>
but oh how ſhe was aſtoniſhed, when ſhe caſt her eye upon his face? and how amazed
was <hi>Alexis,</hi> when ſhe ſaw <hi>Aſtrea</hi> coming to kiſs her? Oh love? into what a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
didſt thou put them both, when they kiſſed each other? The ſhepheardeſſe was as red,
as if her face were all fire; and <hi>Alexis</hi> trembled as if a great fit of an ague had been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her: <hi>Hylas,</hi> who obſerved how zealouſly his Miſtreſſe ſaluted this ſhepherdeſſe, he grew
ſo jealous, that he could not endure ſhe ſhould hold her any longer in her armes; and this
jealouſie was a cauſe of their parting, ſo as <hi>Diana</hi> ſaluted her the next; after her, <hi>Phillis;</hi>
and then all the reſt of the company.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adamas,</hi> who deſired to ſhadow as much as poſſibly he could, the alteration in the
face and ſpirit of his Daughter; after all ſalutations were done, and that all the company
entred confuſedly into the great Chamber, he ſet <hi>Alexis</hi> in the moſt obſcure place; and
when they were all ready to ſit down, he ſeemed to take notice of <hi>Daphnide</hi> and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
therefore asked <hi>Thameres</hi> in a loud voice, who thoſe fair ſtrangers were? Sir, ſaid
he unto him, <hi>Hylas</hi> can better informe you of them, then I can, if it pleaſe you to aske
him; for I can tell you no more, but that we met them as we came hither, and he told us
that they were Ladies of as high eſteem, as any in all the Province of the <hi>Gallogures.</hi>
Then <hi>Paris</hi> coming nearer unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> told him, that it was the fair <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and
the famous <hi>Alcidon,</hi> well known for beauty and merit in the Court of the great <hi>Eurick.</hi>
The <hi>Druid</hi> ſeeming as if he knew nothing of them before, ſeemed alſo to be very angry
with <hi>Paris</hi> for telling him no ſooner. Then addreſſing himſelfe unto her; Madam, (ſaid
he) I beſeech you pardon my ignorance, and lay the fault upon your habit, that I have not
rendred that honour which is your due Reverend Father (anſwered <hi>Daphnide</hi>) when <hi>I</hi>
diſguiſed my ſelfe in this manner, my intention was not to be known in this Country
where I am come, not in the rank of <hi>Daphnide,</hi> but onely to find that tranquility which
the Gods have promiſed unto me: and I do believe, that but for <hi>Hylas,</hi> I had gone
through my voyage, as unknown as <hi>I</hi> deſired. But ſince <hi>I</hi> am prevented, <hi>I</hi> beſeech you
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53527:14"/>
Father, let all thoſe circumſtances of honour and reſpect, which you mention, alone;
and help me to find out thoſe wholſome remedies which the Gods have made me hope
to receive in this Country. <hi>Adamas</hi> with much honour and ſubmiſſion, anſwered her;
that he would ſerve her in all things, within the compaſſe of his capacity; and that he
would not be diſpenced with, for doing her that honour which was her due: then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
a Chair unto her; another unto <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and unto all the reſt of the company,
every one taking their places, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſat next <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <hi>Leonide</hi> on the other ſide,
which prevented <hi>Hylas</hi> from being next his new Miſtreſſe: And becauſe he thought her
too much taken with <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he often interrupted her, and contraried her in her ſpeech,
ſo forced her to anſwer him: <hi>Phillis</hi> perceived by <hi>Aſtrea's</hi> looks, that he was trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to her, and therefore to give her more opportunity of talking with that <hi>Druid,</hi> who
had ſuch a reſemblance of her beloved ſhepherd, ſhe entred into diſcourſe with him; My
late ſervant, ſaid ſhe unto him, is there not one ſpark of that ancient affection towards me
alive? This new Miſtreſs whom you adore ſo much, makes no great account of you:
Come, come, return again to me that loves you, and eſteems you as you deſerve. <hi>Hylas</hi>
who was paſſionatly in love with <hi>Alexis;</hi> Late Miſtreſs, ſaid he unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not unto whom you ſpeak, when you mention any ſparks of old affection; the very
word <hi>old,</hi> is enough to make me hate it. If therefore you would have me return again to
you, talk no more of any old ſparks: for this is my Motto
<q>
                        <l>An hour is too long to love?</l>
                        <l>A Minut's fair; and not above.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do not think that the eſteem which you ſay you have of me, will any thing attract me;
for one never uſeth to care for the eſteem of thoſe whoſe friendſhip he hath quitted, and
who are meerly indifferent to him; <hi>Silvander</hi> then began to anſwer for <hi>Phillis.</hi> Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſaid he, which every one does ſo much deſire, what is it elſe but this eſteem which
you ſo much contemne? if it be to be eſteemed, even amongſt enemies; why, <hi>Hylas,</hi>
ſhould it not be eſteemed from one whom you have ſo much loved? <hi>I</hi> perceive, anſwered
<hi>Hylas,</hi> that <hi>Silvander</hi> is not in the place which he deſires, no more then <hi>I</hi> am; and to
vent his choller upon ſome body, he tells me ſuch tales, as Nurſes uſe to lull their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
aſleep withall: But my good friend <hi>Silvander,</hi> have a good heart, and take patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe rubs of fortune: conſider that we live in a very bad age, wherein favours are not
diſpenſed according to merit; let us be patient man, fortune will one day ceaſe from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid this unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> becauſe <hi>Leonide</hi> in favour of <hi>Paris,</hi> had placed <hi>Diana</hi>
in the midſt, ſo that <hi>Silvander</hi> could not come near her, but was forced to ſit betwixt
<hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>Florice;</hi> which being known unto every one, was the reaſon why every one
laughed at the anſwer, eſpecially <hi>Phillis,</hi> who ſaid; It muſt be confeſſed, <hi>Silvander,</hi> that
now it happens unto you, as unto one who will undertake to part two who are fighting,
and betwixt them is wounded, though he had no quarrel. If you had not often tryed
(anſwered <hi>Silvander</hi>) that the weapons of <hi>Hylas</hi> have neither point nor edge, <hi>I</hi> ſhould
not wonder you ſhou'd ſay ſo. But, ſhepherdeſſe, having had ſo much experience of them,
<hi>I</hi> wonder you ſhould have that opinion: Never wonder (ſaid the ſhepherdeſſes) for he
hath changed his weapons, he does not now fight with his own; thoſe wherewith he hath
now wounded you, are borrowed of one whoſe cuſtome is to vanquiſh. After that rate,
anſwered he, <hi>I</hi> ſhall partly confeſſe as much. To tell you truly (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) neither of
you can wound me, either with your own Armes, or any other you can borrow; for be
they as good as they will, they have no force againſt me: If they were in my hands, ſaid
<hi>Florice,</hi> what would you ſay unto them? <hi>I</hi> would ſay, anſwered he, That <hi>I</hi> do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you ever had any <hi>I</hi> hope, ſaid <hi>Cyrenea,</hi> that you will not ſay ſo by me. <hi>I</hi> muſt
confeſſe (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that when <hi>I</hi> ſaw you but ſeldome, <hi>I</hi> loved you much; and when <hi>I</hi>
ſaw you much, <hi>I</hi> loved you but little. Her ſight then, ſaid <hi>Palinice,</hi> did as the Scorpion
does, which heales the wound it makes; but <hi>I</hi> am confident you will not ſay ſo of me. Of
you (ſaid he, as if he were aſtoniſhed) for God ſake tell me how they call you, that <hi>I</hi>
may know whether your Name can wound me more then your Fade? <hi>I</hi> perceive, ſaid
<hi>Stiliana,</hi> that it is onely <hi>I</hi> who had the power to Captivate you. The ſhort pittance of
time that <hi>I</hi> was your Priſoner, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> does plainly ſhew how victorious you
were. The truth is, replyed ſhe, you did go out of Priſon, but it was not without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53527:14"/>
your ranſome. If <hi>I</hi> did pay it (replied he) then <hi>I</hi> owe you nothing, and if you
thinke to make me your Priſoner againe as eaſily as you did, you are very much
miſtaken: <hi>I</hi> am now a better Souldier then <hi>I</hi> was, and therefore <hi>I</hi> would adviſe you
not to put it to the hazard; your teares <hi>I</hi> aſſure you will not doe it. Come, come,
ſaid <hi>Carlis, Hylas</hi> is only mine, for as <hi>I</hi> was the firſt that ever he loved, ſo he ought
to be the laſt, is not this true, <hi>Hylas?</hi> Conſider <hi>Carlis,</hi> ſaid he unto her, that every thing
wil moſt certainly return to its firſt beginning; and as the firſt time that ever <hi>I</hi> did ſee you, <hi>I</hi>
did not love you; ſo ſhall <hi>I</hi> not love you, the laſt time <hi>I</hi> ſee you.</p>
                  <p>None could forbeare laughi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>g at the anſwers of <hi>Hylas,</hi> which continued ſo long that
<hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had time enough to talke; but though <hi>Alexis</hi> might have imployed
that time very well, yet ſhe was ſo long before ſhe could begin, being hindred by ſeverall
conſiderations, that perhaps the opportunity had been loſt, if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had not begun to
ſpeake firſt. For this diſguiſed Druid ſeeing her before her eyes who had commanded her
never to ſee her, fearing to be known by her voice, or ſome other of her geſtures, was
ſo mute, that ſhe durſt not open her mouth, which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> attributed unto the little
acquaintance that was betwixt them, or elſe conſidering that ſhe had beene alwayes
converſant with the Virgin Druids, ſhe knew not how to talke of Country affaires.
But the ſhepherdeſſe was much miſtaken, for the reaſon was, becauſe ſhe knew too
much, and becauſe that face which did repreſent that of <hi>Celadon,</hi> as well in her memory
as before her eyes, it made her extreamly deſirous to gaine the favour of <hi>Alexis,</hi> which
was already but too much gotten, and therefore ſhee was the firſt that broke ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
thus. When <hi>I</hi> doe conſider the beauty of your face, and the Graces wherewith
the heavens have adorned you above all the Beauties of our age, <hi>I</hi> am almoſt ready
to tax them with injuſtice in depriving this Country ſo long of that which it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
moſt rare, and in hiding you amongſt the Druid Virgins ſo farre from us: But
when <hi>I</hi> call to mind that the whole Univerſe is not too good to ſerve that great God
who made it, <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe that the choice of you was moſt juſt, being the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
peece in the World. <hi>I</hi> wiſh (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) that thoſe perfections which your ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
puts upon me were as truly mine, as yours are in you, that <hi>I</hi> might in ſome ſort
be worthy to ſerve the great <hi>Tautates:</hi> Idoe not bluſh faire ſhepheardeſſe to heare you
uſe this language, which rather puts me in mind of my imperfections, then repreſents
unto me what <hi>I</hi> am. <hi>I</hi> am ſorry, replied <hi>Aſtrea</hi> that you ſhould have ſo ill an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mee, as to thinke that <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe any imperfections in you: For though the
heavens have made me a ſhepheardeſſe, and have given me no more wit then ſuits
with a rurall life, yet as the Sunne is ſeene by all upon whom it ſhines, by ſome more,
ſome leſſe according to their Capacities, ſo may <hi>I</hi> ſee your Perfections, and know
them, ſo farre as to admire them, though <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe that many others unto
whom <hi>Tautates</hi> hath given better judgement, may diſcerne them better, but cannot
admire them more then <hi>I</hi> doe. <hi>I</hi> ſhall not contradict a judgement ſo favourable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Alexis:</hi> only <hi>I</hi> pray God that when you know me better, you doe not revoke
it: For though neither my intention nor profeſſion will let me be long in this place,
yet <hi>I</hi> ſhall alwayes thinke my ſelfe exceedingly happy in the favour of all thoſe who
reſemble you, particularly your ſelfe, whoſe acquaintance <hi>I</hi> have ſo long deſired; and <hi>I</hi>
aſſure you that this deſire will make me leave my Companions with leſſe griefe, when
<hi>I</hi> know that <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſee <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> Madam, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> this favour is tranſcendent:
For if you have a will to be with us, our happineſſe is immeaſurable; or if it be out
Complement onely to oblige us, yet we are happy in that you entertaine ſuch thoughts
in you. But <hi>I</hi> may moſt truly ſay, that the newes of your coming filled the Country
both with joy and ſorrow; ſorrow in hearing of your ſickneſſe, and joy to hear we ſhould
be ſo happy as to ſee you. It is ſo long before you came hither (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) that if any
other but you, fair ſhepherdeſſe had told me ſo, <hi>I</hi> ſhould not have beleeved it; but to let this
diſcourſe alone, <hi>I</hi> beſeech you tell me, how you uſe ordinarily to ſpend your time:
for <hi>I</hi> am told that the ſhepherds and ſhepherdeſſes of <hi>Forreſts</hi> doe live the happieſt of any
people in the World. It is certainly (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) very happy unto ſuch whom For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
hath not forſaken: and you know Madam, that thoſe who were once happy, when
they loſe part of what they injoyed, are more miſerable then thoſe who alwayes were
miſerable. Tis true, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> doe not thinke your rurall and ſolitary life doth
meet with any rubs of Fortune. Not ſo much ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> as thoſe who live in Court,
and in the tranſactions of the World; but as Lakes though leſſe then the Sea, have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53527:15"/>
their ſtormes and tempeſts; ſo it is with us, we alſo have our misfortunes and miſeries;
and for my part <hi>I</hi> may well ſay, that having within the ſpace of one month loſt a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and a mother, my affliction is ſo great, that <hi>I</hi> am not yet recovered of it: Is it
long, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſince you had this loſſe? About foure or five months ſince, (ſaid
<hi>Aſtrea</hi>) and upon this ſhe fetched a deep ſigh: It is a very ſad affliction (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>)
to loſe ſuch friends, but nothing is more naturall, then for Parents to dye before Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
and this may be your comfort, that they left you at an age wherein you are able
to governe your ſelfe. One thing, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> doth moſt exceedingly trouble me,
which is, that <hi>I</hi> am partly a cauſe of their death: Truly, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> you bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my memorie, that <hi>I</hi> have heard ſomething concerning it, and <hi>I</hi> thinke they told
me that they were drown'd, in endeavouring to helpe you out of a water into which
you were falne. Pardon me Madam, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> it is true, that <hi>I</hi> fell into that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> endeavoured to helpe a ſhepherd who was drowned there:
and the newes being carried to <hi>Hippolita</hi> my Mother, that <hi>I</hi> was drowned, ſhe was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
with ſuch a fright, that ſhe did never recover it, but dyed preſently after: and
my Father for griefe of her followed her: Thus was <hi>I</hi> at once deprived both of father
and mother. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> could not relate theſe accidents without much griefe, and <hi>Alexis</hi>
alſo; ſeeming as if it were out of compaſſion: <hi>I</hi> pray ſaid ſhe, who was that poore ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
which was drowned? <hi>I</hi> know not, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſadly, whether you heard of him,
but his name was <hi>Celadon,</hi> brother unto <hi>Lycidas</hi> whom you ſee there: Was it <hi>Celadon</hi>
(ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) who was ſonne unto <hi>Alcippes</hi> and <hi>Amarillis?</hi> The ſame, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea;
I</hi> have often heard talke of him, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> truly it was a very ſad accident. <hi>I</hi> aſſure
you Madam, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that all manner of delights hath been ever ſince baniſhed out
Coaſts,; For when he was alive, there was nothing but mirth and jollity amongſt us,
and now ſuch a dulneſſe reignes, as if it were not the ſame Country: And for my part
having loſt a Father and a Mother, who loved me moſt tenderly, and falne into the
hands of an Uncle, my ſorrowes are double. But Madam <hi>I</hi> beſeech you pardon me
for troubling you with ſuch ſad diſcourſe. Oh, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> you doe infinitely ingage
me in it, and you will doe me an extreame pleaſure if you will give me a relation of
every particular which concernes you; for beſides your merit and vertue, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
every one to eſteem you, <hi>I</hi> have a moſt particular deſire to be intereſted in your
love; and therefore <hi>I</hi> beſeech you continue on Madam, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> it is an infinite
honour to me, and <hi>I</hi> proteſt unto you, that from the very firſt minute <hi>I</hi> ſaw you, there
is ſomething which ſo devotes me unto you, that nothing can divert me from your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Alexis</hi> would have replied, and perhaps have entred farther into diſcourſe
if the jealouſie of <hi>Hylas</hi> had not hindred her; but he not being able to endure this long
diſcourſe betweene theſe two Lovers, he did impudently fall upon his knees before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis,</hi>
and taking her hand, kiſſed it before ſhe was aware, which ſhe perceiving pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
backe, and ſaid unto him: how now Servant, does the faire ſhepherdeſſes of <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
permit ſuch familiarities? The Virgin Druids, from whence <hi>I</hi> came, <hi>I</hi> aſſure you
would thinke this very ſtrange. Miſtreſſe, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> even as <hi>I</hi> doe not uſe to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
my ſelfe according to the civility of theſe ſhepherdeſſes, ſo you ought not to follow
the ſeverity of thoſe Druids: for if you doe, neither you nor <hi>I</hi> ſhall receive much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
by it. <hi>I</hi> know not what you meane, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> am ſure you muſt have
very ſtrong arguments to divert me from following the example of thoſe holy Virgins,
amongſt whom <hi>I</hi> have beene ſo long converſant. <hi>I</hi> do beleeve what you ſay, replied <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
but you muſt know, you need no worſe Rhethorique to make me change my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<hi>I</hi> ſhould be ſorry, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> to force you unto any change, for <hi>I</hi> would
have you be as you are; onely let the law be equall between us; and this, as your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
you may very well allow. Tis true, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but how doe you meane?
<hi>I</hi> meane ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that as <hi>I</hi> allow you to be as you are, ſo you muſt allow me to be
as <hi>I</hi> am; and without any changing of humours, either in you or me, we may love
each other, as we did at firſt. <hi>I</hi> doe allow of part of what you ſay, replied <hi>Hylas;</hi> but
the reſt is not according to my mind: and <hi>I</hi> feare you have beene ſo cloyſtered up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Camutes, that you are halfe ſpoiled: Every one began to laugh at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of <hi>Hylas.</hi> In the meane time, <hi>Adamas</hi> entertained <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> after
this manner.</p>
                  <p>Madam (ſaid he unto her) <hi>I</hi> make no queſtion but that it was upon a good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
you came into this Country: for otherwiſe you would never have left the luſtre
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53527:15"/>
and delicacies of the Court, <hi>I</hi> ſhould not have preſumed to aske the cauſe, had not your
ſelfe emboldned me; and knowing thereby that you expect ſome ſervice from me, my
readines to do it, prompts me to ask what it is, to the end <hi>I</hi> may ſerve you according to your
merit, and my duty. Father, anſwered <hi>Daphnide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> your wiſdom, and my need of your aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
makes me truſt you both with this ſecret, and the greateſt <hi>I</hi> ſhall ever have. <hi>I</hi> ſhall
think my condition very happy, ſaid the Druid, if <hi>I</hi> meet with any occaſions to employ
my ſelfe in your ſervice: and to make it appeare how much <hi>I</hi> eſteem your merit, <hi>I</hi> beſeeth
you take ſo much paines to ſee a Gallery which is in this houſe, and there you ſhall find
your own Picture ranked as it deſerves. <hi>I</hi> did never think, ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a thing
ſo little worthy, of either ſeeing or preſerving, ſhould be in the poſſeſſion of the Great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas.</hi>
Yet ſince you have done ſo, <hi>I</hi> ſhall think the Gods intend good unto me, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
this curioſity unto you, which argues a willingneſſe to helpe me in this buſineſſe,
from whence my whole happineſſe muſt proceed. <hi>I</hi> ſhall acquaint you Father, before we
part, with the occaſion which brought me hither; in the meane time, <hi>I</hi> beſeech you till
me, in what part of this Country is the fountaine of loves verity? and how <hi>I</hi> may ſee it?
<hi>I</hi> can verily tell you, Madam, ſaid the Druid, where this Fountaine is, for it is not farre
from hence: but <hi>I</hi> thinke it to be a thing impoſſible for you to ſee it, becauſe it is ſtrangely
inchanted, and guarded by Lyons and other fierce Animals, ſo as no humane force can
quell them. If the hazard of a life, ſaid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> will conduce unto the contentment of
my Lady, ſhe ſhall quickly receive what ſhe deſires. <hi>I</hi> doe believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid the Druid, that if
courage and valour could doe any thing againſt inchantments, the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> would
have what ſhe deſires, by the meanes of the valiant <hi>Alcidon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you muſt know, that the ſtrength of all men in the world united together, will do no
good; for ſpirits which are ſuperior unto the nature of men, are ſo puiſſant, that even one
of them is able to ruine the whole Vniverſe, unleſſe the great Tautates for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mankind, did reſtrain them: ſo as the ſafer way is to have recourſe unto Prayers
and Supplications, or elſe ſtay untill the time prefixed be expired, and the conditions of
the inchantment performed. What are the conditions? ſaid <hi>Alcidon:</hi> They are, ſaid
<hi>Adamas,</hi> very ſtrange: For the enchantment muſt not end but in blood, and by the death
of the moſt faithfull lover, and loved, that ever was in this Country. This, ſaid
<hi>Daphnide,</hi> is a moſt ſtrange Fate, and muſt needs be miſerable My ſelfe (ſaid <hi>Alcidon</hi>)
can furniſh out the moſt faithfull lover: yes, ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and ſmiled, if to love in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
places at once, be fidelity. If you, replyed <hi>Alcidon,</hi> could but manifeſt your fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as <hi>I</hi> can, <hi>Alcidon</hi> would preſently hazard his life. <hi>I</hi> aſſure you, ſaid <hi>Daphnide, I</hi>
am not ſo deſperate as to die, to make inchantments ceaſe. But Madam, ſaid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> It
ſhould ſeem the will of the Gods ſo to doe, ſince they commanded us to come hither. <hi>I</hi>
ſhall obey the will of the Gods, ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> as far as poſſibly <hi>I</hi> can; but before <hi>I</hi> take
this courſe, muſt have a more cleare and abſolute command for it. This, replyed <hi>Alcidon,</hi>
argues but a very faint affection: <hi>I</hi> do confeſſe it, ſaid ſhe; for <hi>I</hi> cannot undertake to be a
ſacrifice for the publique: beſides, <hi>I</hi> am not now in love with any; and therefore why
ſhould <hi>I</hi> hazard my life for any: and if <hi>I</hi> were, <hi>I</hi> would not do it. <hi>I</hi> ſhould think them
out of their wits that would; for it is not likely any that loves well, would deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the ſight and preſence of them they love, to put an end to an inchantment.</p>
                  <p>But Father, ſaid ſhe, and turned towards <hi>Adamas, I</hi> ſee that <hi>Alcidon</hi> conſtraines me
to diſcover unto you, the cauſe of my coming hither: If you pleaſe therefore we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and <hi>I</hi> ſhall willingly doe it, upon condition you will give me the beſt advice you
can Madam, ſaid the Druid, <hi>I</hi> would <hi>I</hi> were as able to give you good counſell, as my
affection promps me to do you all manner of ſervice: If you pleaſe therefore to leave all
this good company together, you may retire into a Gallery which is cloſe by, and call
whom you pleaſe to accompany you. Upon this, riſing up, <hi>Adamas</hi> addreſſed himſelfe
unto <hi>Leonide, Paris,</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> and commanded them to ſtay with thoſe faire ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes,
and curteous ſhepheards, whileſt he waited upon <hi>Daphnide</hi> into the Gallery:
and you, <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid he, laying his hand upon his ſhoulder, <hi>I</hi> entreat you to entertaine
this good company, and as one of our beſt friends do my houſe honour: Faith, ſaid
<hi>Hylas</hi> faintly, <hi>I</hi> uſe more to diſhonour, then honor the houſes where <hi>I</hi> am; yet to obey you,
<hi>I</hi> will do my beſt, provided my Miſtreſs will do as <hi>I</hi> bid her: every one did laugh at the
anſwer of <hi>Hylas,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Alexis,</hi> who holding her hand before her face, ſaid unto
him very handſomly; Perhaps <hi>Hylas,</hi> you will he too ſevere; No, no, ſaid <hi>Hylas, I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
but word for word, if ſo, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> and if <hi>Adamas</hi> permit me, <hi>I</hi> am content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53527:16"/>
Then, faireſt Miſtreſs, ſaid he unto her, entreat all this company, eſpecially <hi>Hylas,</hi> to
keep you company all this day, and a little longer if you will. For why ſhould ſo many
good friends part ſo ſoon? <hi>Adamas</hi> who was very glad of this requeſt, anſwered before
<hi>Alexis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> aſſure you <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid he, that <hi>I</hi> do deſire it with all my heart, and thoſe who will
not condeſcend unto that deſire, doe extreamly diſoblige me. <hi>I</hi> will tell you, Father, for
them all, ſaid <hi>Hylas;</hi> that we will all obey you with as good a will as you can deſire
it: and though all ſhould goe away, yet <hi>I</hi> would ſtay alone, to give a teſtimony what
power you have over me. Believe me, <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> you have very well impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
your ſelfe in this Country, and have learned ſo much civility, that when you come
againe into <hi>Camargue,</hi> you may keep a Schoole, Madam, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> If all my Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
would prove like unto my Miſtreſs, I ſhall take ſome delight in it: otherwiſe, believe
me, I would not impart my knowledge, unleſſe unto ſome ſuch a one as your ſelfe. You
doe oblige me, ſaid ſhe, in equalling me unto <hi>Alexis.</hi> Pardon me, replyed <hi>Hylas</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I did not well conſider with my ſelfe when <hi>I</hi> committed this error; for ſuch is my
affection unto my Miſtreſſe, that <hi>I</hi> cannot judge of any thing but to her advantage. <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
had anſwered,, if ſhe had heard theſe words, but ſhe was gone away too far off, and
carried with her <hi>Alcidon, Stiliana, Carlis,</hi> and <hi>Hermantes,</hi> the reſt ſtayed in the Great
Chamber, where a Collation was brought in.</p>
                  <p>The Gallery into which the wiſe <hi>Adamas</hi> conducted <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> was more
conſiderable for the curioſities which were in it, then for the magnificence of the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
though the Doors, Windowes, and Chimneyes, were all of perfectly poliſhed
Marble, very rich and beautifull, though the lights were at juſt diſtances; a regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
in the height and wideneſſe, exactly obſerved according to the length and rules of
Architecture; and Fretworkes and Gilding was not ſpared; yet ſuch had been the care of
the wiſe Druid, to inrich it with all manner of rarities and curioſities, which either <hi>Europe,
Aſia,</hi> or <hi>Africa</hi> produced; not onely of his owne time, but of all ages paſt, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
was not loſt, that theſe did much exceed the richneſſe of the buildings; and as the
one did take the eye with beauty, the other did ſtrike the mind with admiration beyond all
thought.</p>
                  <p>The Arch which was ſupported by a large Frice, was painted with the moſt ancient
Hiſtory of the Gaules, ever ſince the great <hi>Dis-Samothes</hi> unto <hi>Francus,</hi> who being
abſent, and taken up with his other Conqueſts, leſt the Government of the Dominions
unto the Druids and Gauliſh Knights. There was not forgotten the Great <hi>Dryus,</hi> who by
the inſtitution of the Druids, left Religion, and the Laws of his Fathers, unto his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Nephews. There alſo was the portracture of the Great <hi>Hercules,</hi> who married the
Princeſs <hi>Galathea,</hi> who by his eloquence and Arms, did draw the Gaules unto Civility,
and unto Generoſity by his example. There alſo was <hi>Sigoveſus,</hi> and <hi>Belloneſſus;</hi> the one
of which went over the Alpes, conquered, and <hi>Callidot,</hi> Gaul <hi>Ciſalpine;</hi> and the other
paſſing into the Forreſt of <hi>Hircinia,</hi> did found the Kingdom of the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yens.</hi> To be briefe,
there one might ſee the Gaules under <hi>Brennus,</hi> triump in <hi>Rome</hi> over thoſe great Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
there loading themſelves with Gold: And paſſing from thence into <hi>Greece,</hi> rifled
the Gold and Treaſures of the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and ſo returned into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>Above this, was a ſecond Frice, wrought with ſeverall ſorts of Fretwork gilded,
which was a great ornament to the Edifice. Betwixt them both, was placed the ſtatues of
the Roman Emperours, from <hi>Caeſar</hi> unto the third <hi>Valentinian.</hi> But the greateſt curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the place was, that every ſpace betwixt the Windows, was filled with Maps of all
the Provinces of Gaule, ſo exactly drawne, that as one walked, one might not only know
the diſtances of places, but alſo the ſcituation of places, Townes, their Climates, the
courſes of the Rivers, and the propriety of every Province in this little world. No ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
battle, or important ſiege, but was ſet in its right place; ſo as the great ſiege of
<hi>Alexia,</hi> and the ſignal expeditions of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> might be ſeen in the plates where they were
acted.</p>
                  <p>About theſe Maps, might be ſeene the Pictures of thoſe Princes, who ruled thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
from time to time, ſo as there might be ſeen <hi>Pharamond, Clodion,</hi> and <hi>Merovius;</hi>
and after him, without any Crown, <hi>Childerick</hi> his Son, for he was not yet King, becauſe
his Father was alive. In the Map of the <hi>Sequaners</hi> and <hi>Hednois,</hi> one might ſee <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
and his wife <hi>Bliſinde,</hi> who though he never paſſed the Rhine, was yet ſet there as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53527:16"/>
Father unto the valiant <hi>Gaud ſelles</hi> the firſt King of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> who planted upon
the bankes of <hi>Arar</hi> and <hi>Roſne.</hi> Next unto this King was his wife the wiſe and pious
<hi>Theudelinda;</hi> after them, their ſonne <hi>Gunditch,</hi> who did firſt ſettle the Crown in <hi>Gaul;</hi>
after that, <hi>Gondebert</hi> with his three Brothers, <hi>Chilperio, Godamar,</hi> and <hi>Godegeſiles.</hi> To
be briefe, the Druide was ſo curious, that nothing could be deſired, which was not to be
ſeen there; ſo as <hi>Daphnide, Alcidon,</hi> and their company admired at theſe rarities, and
eſteemed them the moſt excellent peeces that ever eye beheld, and caſting her eye by
chance upon the map of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> ſaw there all the valiant Viſigots
who there reigned; As ſoone as ſhe perceived them, ſhe could not take off her eye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe knew there the names and faces of many: Amongſt the reſt, of <hi>Thoriſmond</hi> of
<hi>Thierry</hi> his Brother, and of the valiant <hi>Eurioke,</hi> next whom ſhe ſaw her owne Picture,
as when ſhe was about the age of eighteen or twenty yeares, ſhe kept her eye long upon
it; and afterwards caſting them upon the Portraiture of <hi>Euricke,</hi> ſhe could not chuſe
but ſigh and ſay: Oh great <hi>Euricke,</hi> how fatall was the expedition which raviſhed thy
Scepter from thee, and what great cauſe have I to grieve, ſince it is not permitted me
to follow thee? Madam, replied <hi>Alcidon,</hi> it muſt needs be confeſſed, that the loſſe of
<hi>Euricke</hi> was a generall loſſe, but it would have beene much greater, if yours had follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed;
and doe you not thinke that the Gods in preſerving you had a great care of me?
Such is their goodneſſe Madam, that they never reject the prayers of the juſt. I doe
wonder at that the more, ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> becauſe mine are not received which were
made with ſo much juſtice and reaſon: For, is it not moſt juſt and reaſonable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
in death, thoſe whom they loved in life? <hi>Adamas</hi> hearing his diſcourſe was
very deſirous to heare more, ſo as beſeeching <hi>Daphnide</hi> to ſubmit her will to the great
<hi>Tautates,</hi> he deſired her to ſit downe, and to beleeve that all things are ſo wiſely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by him, that all humane wiſdome was conſtrained to confeſſe it ſelfe ignorant and
blind, in compariſon of his omniſcient Providence. Then <hi>Daphnide</hi> ſitting next unto
<hi>Adamas,</hi> and all the reſt of the company taking their places, ſhe began thus.</p>

                     <p>I know very well, reverend Father, that the great <hi>Tautates</hi> does all things for the
beſt: For loving us, as the workmanſhip of his owne hands; it is not likely he
will withdraw his love from us. But let me tell you, that as <hi>Phiſique</hi> though for our
good is yet very bitter and loathſome; ſo thoſe afflictions which wee receive from the
hands of the Gods, though they be very good for us, yet are they very heavy upon thoſe
that receive them. Thoſe who murmur againſt his will are indeed much too blame; but
if when they feele the ſmart they ſhrinke and bewaile it, they doe but pay the Tribute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
of their weakneſſe and humanity. I doe confeſſe, that the goods which <hi>I</hi> have received
from his hands are innumerable, and his favours are above his puniſhments; but we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all of a nature more ſenſible of the bad, than the good, <hi>I</hi> am forced to ſay, that the
afflictions which <hi>I</hi> have received have almoſt blotted out the memory of the bleſſings.
And being reſolved to retire my ſelfe from the ſtormes of the World, there is nothing
which hinders me but the purſuit of this Cavalier, whom <hi>I</hi> call troubleſome: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the occaſion which brought me into this Country; I beſeech you Father give me
leave to let you underſtand how the caſe ſtands betwixt us; that ſince the Fountaine of
loves Verity is ſhut, we may by your wiſe Counſell and advice, finde ſome eaſe in
our troubles.</p>
                     <p>Know therefore that <hi>Thierry</hi> the great King of the Viſigots dying honourably in the
battle ſought in the <hi>Cathalaunique</hi> fields, he left many children behind him, ſucceſſors,
not only in his Crowne, but alſo in his courage and valour. He who firſt ſucceeded him
was <hi>Thoriſmond</hi> his eldeſt Sonne, he being received King and crowned in <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> he
made it his principall ſtudy, not only to enlarge the limits of his Kingdome: but alſo
to repleniſh it with Cavaliers and Ladies: Heaven was at that time favourable unto his
will; for neither <hi>Ataulfes</hi> nor <hi>Vulalia</hi> his Predeceſſors, nor the great <hi>Thierry</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had neere ſo many accompliſhed Gallants nor ſo many faire and wiſe Ladies as this
great and generous King had. It was my Fortune at that time to be brought unto the
Court by my mother, when I was about fifteene or ſixteen yeares of age. I muſt confeſſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53527:17"/>
that I did not yeild unto any of my age, in the good opinion which I had of my ſelfe,
either by reaſon of the confidence I had in my own beauty, which the flatteries of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
into me, or by reaſon of that love which every one is apt to have of themſelvs, which
made me thinke all things more perfect in me than in others: But ſo it was, that me
thought I did attract the hearts as well as the eyes of all in the Court. The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
who was one of the moſt accompliſhed Princes that ever the Viſigots had, da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gned
to caſt a favourable eye upon me, and to carraſſe me; but there being a diſparity in our
ages, he did withdraw himſelfe conceiving and conſidering that ſuch a love was more fit
for one that was younger than himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time <hi>Alcidon</hi> was with the King, and I may without flattery ſay before
his face, that then he was the very Sun of the Court, the beauty of his face, his ſtature,
his hanſome proportion, his garbe, his becomingneſſe in every thing: his ſweet diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
his courteſie, valour, vivacity of ſpirit and wit, his generoſity, and his other
perfections did get him the onely eſteeme of the time. The King who was infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
that his Court ſhould flouriſh in the bravery of Cavaliers, above all other Courts
of <hi>Europe;</hi> he obſerving the merit of <hi>Alcidon</hi> in his youth, did take a particular care
of him, aſſuring himſelfe that if this hopeful Plant wat carefully pruned, he would prove
the glory of his Court.</p>
                     <p>Never bluſh <hi>Alcidon</hi> to heare me ſpeake ſo advantagiouſly of you in your preſence: I
would have you know that my juſt hatred of you, ſhall not hinder me from ſpeaking the
truth, and becauſe ſhe pauſed a little, as if ſhe expected he ſhould anſwer; I do admire,
ſaid he, that you ſhould ſee in me ſuch ſecret qualities, which perhaps all that know me
would contradict, and yet that you ſhould neither ſee nor beleeve my extreame affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
it being ſo great, as all that know me cannot be ignorant of it. I have long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
this in my ſoule, and can find no other reaſon for it, unleſſe that perhaps you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
thoſe that make their eſteem to appeare higheſt when they would be ſhut of the
perſon whom they ſeem to eſteem; We ſhall debate that, ſaid he, another time, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to her diſcourſe, ſhe thus cotinued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoriſmond</hi> intending to furniſh <hi>Alcidon</hi> with all poſſible accompliſhments and
knowing that the braveſt actions and noble deſignes doe ſpring from love, to ſow the ſeeds
in his ſoule, he commanded him to love and court me. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who was not ſo young,
(though not above eighteen yeares of age) but he was apprehenſive of the favour which
the King did him, and knowing alſo that his advancement depended upon his obedience
he undertooke his Commands, and applied himſelfe unto me, as much as any one of hils
age poſſibly could; and to traine up his Youth in all compleat exerciſes, the King cauſed
Bals to be kept very often, alſo Riding at the Ring and Tilting: It chanced, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after <hi>Alcidon</hi> had received this command, the Ball was kept in the preſence of
<hi>Thoriſmond</hi> and the Queene: it was the cuſtome at thoſe Bals, to dreſſe themſelves with
their beſt art: It hapned that day day, as if it were done upon deſign, that both he and
I were in white. And becauſe he would let the King ſee how willing he was to obey
his commands, when the Ball began, he tooke me out; which the King perceiving, and
obſerving that the youngneſſe of both was ſuch as we had not confidence enough to ſpeak
unto each other, he began to laugh, and ſay unto thoſe about him. I cannot tell who
put that couple together; but if it was Fortune, it appears in this that ſhe is not blind;
for I thinke they could not poſſibly be better ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cht. They are both as innocent as their
habits ſpeakes them, and I beleeve they have not ſo much boldneſſe as to ſpeak one word:
And it hapned as the King ſaid; for young <hi>Alcidon</hi> (whether out of baſhfulneſſe, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome ſparke of love began to kindle in his ſoule which kept him in that reſpect off
me) did paſs away all that night and ſpoke not one word unto me. And I, having no
deſignes at that time, did ſtudy to pleaſe the eyes of all in generall, and had no particu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar
aimes.</p>
                     <p>Ever ſince this day affection increaſed, and to that height, that as his heart was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed,
ſo his tongue told his diſeaſe: And I muſt confeſſe that his merits and ſervices
gave ſuch eloquence unto his language, that I was perſwaded he did love me, and ere
long that he did deſerve to be loved. In the meane time, he advanced himſelfe ſo high in
the favour of his Maſter, that there was no office about him ſo great, unto which he
might not aſpire; and indeed after he had given him free acceſſe unto his Perſon, and in
all privacies how great ſoever, he beſtowed upon him the greateſt office belonging to his
Crown, though perhaps his minority of age was not ſo fit for it, as ſome other. The

lay, fearing ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> in this Kingdome, which was deprived of ſo great a King.
As for <hi>Alcidon,</hi> his griefe was ſuch, as it was believed he would not live: He knowes how
I reſented his ſorrowes, and grieved for his loſſe, as our amity commanded me; yet he had
ſo forgotten both me, and all his promiſes, as I never heard of him all that time. Unto
<hi>Thoriſmond,</hi> ſucceeded his brother <hi>Thierry,</hi> who took upon him the Crown of the <hi>Viſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,</hi>
with a deſire to augment it. And to that end, hearing that the King of <hi>Swedes</hi>
would needs extend their limits unto <hi>Spain:</hi> he ſent him word, (though he had married
his ſiſter) that if he would not deſiſt from this enterpriſe, he would oppoſe him: of which
<hi>Richard</hi> making no account, (for ſo was the King of <hi>Swedes</hi> called); <hi>Thierry</hi> paſſed over
the <hi>Pirenian</hi> hills, fought him, and was victorious. <hi>Thierry,</hi> dying preſently after. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
his brother ſucceeded him; who by his valour, quelled all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> or the people;
and afterwards ſeeing that the Romans, who called us their ancient friends and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
would ſubmit unto us as the reſt of the Gaules, he turned his Armes againſt us, I
mean in the Province of the Romans.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon particular deſcription of theſe Victories, ſince they are not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to our diſcourſe. But I muſt tell you, that after he had taken the City of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians,</hi>
he beſieged <hi>Arles,</hi> becauſe until that time I never heard of <hi>Alcidon:</hi> and he had
no more memory of me, then if he had never ſeen me. But then, as if he was newly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
out of a deep ſleep, he bethought himſelfe, and writ unto me. You may imagine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
how a young ſpirit, that had a very good opinion of herſelfe, could reſent this long
ſilence, which I could not call ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>om, becauſe I valued my ſelfe at ſuch a rate, as I thought
I could not be ſcorned. Now thinking very often with my ſelfe, that he cared not for me,
I vowed a hundred times not to care for him; and that though he ſhould return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me with all imaginable ſubmiſſion, yet would I look upon him onely with an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
eye: I will not deny, but this loſſe was a very great griefe unto my ſoule; and I muſt
confeſſe; I love him; ſo as when I received this Letter from him, the memory of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
merit, made me break open the ſeals and I found theſe words.</p>

to let him champ a little upon the bit, purpoſely to ſharpen his deſire; knowing very
well, that love aſpires alwaies moſt at that which he thinks is forbidden. And in this

                     <p>The Army was then about <hi>Arles,</hi> and the Great <hi>Eurick</hi> having taken the City of the
<hi>Maſſilians;</hi> intended to force this, to make himſelfe Maſter of all the Province of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;
and to Ruine and Ravage all ſuch as would not ſubmit unto him. In this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
he re-inforced his Army, and waſted all places where he had no hopes that his
Armes could retaine: upon this account, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Regnois,</hi> the <hi>Tricaſtins,
Arauſe, Valence,</hi> and many other places, felt the fury of his ſword, whileſt he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

as well by reaſon of it naturall ſtrength, as the great number of Souldiers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it.</p>
                     <p>As for my Father, when my Mother and I left the Court, after the death of <hi>Thoriſmond,</hi>
he retired himſelfe unto a ſtrong place which he had in <hi>Aquitaine.</hi> My Mother, who was
much affraid of War, thinking to ſhun it, came unto the Province of the Romans, and it
was there where it proved moſt hot; But when ſhe heard that the Army of Great <hi>Eurick</hi>
was coming, ſhe retired unto the fartheſt part of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> along the River of <hi>Sorgues,</hi>
where ſhe had a good houſe, and a ſiſter married, not above four or five leagues from
thence, unto a principal Cavalier of the Country.</p>
                     <p>When I received this Letter from <hi>Alcidon,</hi> the indiſpoſition of my mother, gave me li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to diſpoſe of my ſelfe freely; for her diſeaſe being onely age, and no other violent
diſeaſe, unto which Phyſick was remedy; ſhe gave me the freedom of diverting my ſelfe,
ſometime in walking along the River ſide, and ſometimes in viſiting my Neighbours,
moſt of whom were my kindred and allies. <hi>I</hi> ſent therefore by word of mouth unto
<hi>Alcidon,</hi> by him who brought the Letter, That if he ſhould be at <hi>Lers,</hi> which is a Caſtle
ſcituated upon the <hi>Roſne,</hi> the fourth day of the following moneth. <hi>I</hi> would ſee him, and
that <hi>I</hi> pitched upon this place, becauſe <hi>I</hi> knew the Maſter of it was his friend, and a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
unto the King <hi>Eurick:</hi> but that he ſhould come as privately as he could, becauſe if it
was known he was there, he would run a great hazard, by being in an enemies Country,
and <hi>I</hi> ſhould be talked of as the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Daphnide</hi> pauſed a while, and rubbed her hand upon her forehead, as if ſhe were
conſidering what ſhe ſhould ſay: at laſt turning towards <hi>Alcidon, I</hi> would willingly go
on, (ſaid ſhe unto him) but methinks it better, that as <hi>I</hi> have told what concernes me,
ſo you ſhould tell what concernes you, to the end <hi>Adamas</hi> hearing us both ſpeak, he may
be more aſſured of the truth, <hi>Alcidon</hi> anſwered, you may command me any thing, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
and <hi>I</hi> ſhall moſt readily obey: but methinks you much wound the wiſdome of this
great Druid, by ſaying he will ſooner believe my words, then yours; for certainly you
know better what <hi>I</hi> did, then <hi>I</hi> my ſelfe; for my life hath been no better then a death,
and <hi>I</hi> would not live a moment longer, then in obedience to you. <hi>Adamas</hi> then began
to ſpeak: Sir, ſaid he, Were I as much in love with this Lady as you are, this belief might
well be in me; but ſince I am not, what you doe ſay of your ſelfe, does more aſſure me
of the truth: and ſince ſhe gives you authority, you need not make any difficulty of it.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53527:18"/>
Authority? ſaid <hi>Daphnide:</hi> Nay more, I command him; and, if he be as good as his
word, he will not diſobey, unleſſe he love me more in word then deed. <hi>Alcidon</hi> then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an humble reverence; this teſtimony, ſaid he, is but weake, to ſhew my deſires of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
you; yet becauſe I muſt obey in all, I will in this: Then he began thus,</p>
                     <p>I will not repeat what this fair Lady hath ſpoken, nor will I offer to excuſe my ſelfe of
what ſhe doth blame me, at this time: for I believe it will come in more pertinently in
ſome other place, before this diſcourſe be ended, in which I ſhall ſhew her my reaſons,
and let her know the ſincerity of my affection; or elſe I hope, that when I have ended
this relation, ſhe will give me leave to defend my ſelfe; not againſt her, but onely againſt
thoſe bad impreſſions which calumny hath imprinted in her, in prejudice of my innocence.
And ſo taking the ſtory where ſhe left it, I ſhall onely ſay, that when her anſwer was
brought me, never did man think himſelfe more happy, more contented, nor better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with this Fortune than I. I read and kiſſed the Letter a thouſand times, and as often
imbraced the welcome Meſſenger; and becauſe he was a man in whom I had great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
and who had often given good teſtimonies of his fidelity, therefore I imployed
him in this buſineſſe, which ſo neerly concerned me; and I asked him a thouſand que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
as whether ſhe was as faire as when I laſt ſaw her? whether ſhe expreſſed any
ſignes of loving mee, and above all, whether he heard ſhe loved any other? And when
he anſwered according to my minde, I did imbrace him with ſuch raptures of joy, as
he ſwore he would tell me no more, ſince I was ready to choake him with hugging him
in my armes.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Thierry</hi> dyed, he left his Crowne, as the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> told you, unto his
brother <hi>Euricke,</hi> a Prince, who by his great and vertuous actions, did with general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
get the title of Great. This Prince did not onely ſucceed his brothers in the
Crowne, but alſo in their Deſignes, ſo as he ſhewed the ſame favours unto me, that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmond</hi>
did, an event which happens very rarely in the change of Princes; the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
ſeldome affects thoſe whom the Predeceſſor loved; yet more by my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
than merit, I had this honour, ſo as I was raiſed by <hi>Thoriſmond</hi> and maintained by
<hi>Thierry,</hi> I was alſo favoured by the great <hi>Euricke,</hi> not now as a child, but a man able
to doe him ſervice, as I was obliged. The favour of this Prince had brought me into ſuch
familiarity with him, as he concealed but few things from me, and his love leſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing elſe. And this Prince, though in all things great, yet he excelled all in his
age in courteſie and love. I neither could, nor ought at this preſent, be abſent from his
Army, without his leave, and therefore I tooke a time when he was alone in his Cloſet,
where after a ſmile? Sir, ſaid I unto him, I have a deſigne in my thoughts, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you give me leave to put it in execution. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> anſwered he, your courage hath
often prompted you unto things moſt dangerous, and I wiſh you would have more
care of your ſelfe, then hitherto you have had: for Fortune is full of inconſtancy; though
ſhe ſmile at one time, ſhe will frowne at another, and no prudent man will tempt or truſt
her too farre; yet tell me what your enterpriſe is? And having more experience then
you, I ſhall know whether it be ſeaſable or no. Sir, replyed I, and ſmiled, were it a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
that depended upon <hi>Mars,</hi> I ſhould expect from you very good inſtructions; but
needing no other guide but Love, who is blind, and a Boy, I thinke that I ſhall not
need either your prudence or experience. The King then imbraced me and ſaid; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidon,</hi>
my advice in that alſo will not be unprofitable: for you know that I am a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
as well under the banner of Love, as of <hi>Mars;</hi> ſo taking me by the hand, he would
not let me reſt, until he got out of me, the name of <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and the place where I
was to goe unto her: He had heard often of her name, but had never ſeen her, yet by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
knew that ſhe was very faire: Upon this, he was ſo farre from obſtructing my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
that he did not only offer me all manner of aſſiſtance, but to accompany me him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
and when he ſaw I would not give conſent unto that, he adviſed me to goe with
very few perſons, but upon good Horſes, and with men who feared no dangers. That
above all, I ſhould not ſtay in any Towne or Houſe, but onely to get Victuall, and
then to eat it, and lye in ſome Wood. If this Lady, ſaid he, have promiſed you any
good will loſe not the opportunity; for there is a criticall houre in which women will
grant any thing one will aske, if one can but hit upon it; and on the contrary, if one
let that houre ſlip, without ſerving her, ſhe will never, or very rarely be recovered: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
theſe advices of Love, and many others, which would be too tedious to rehearſe, he
gave me leave to depart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:53527:19"/>
The Caſtle of <hi>Lers</hi> which <hi>Daphnide</hi> made choice of to be the place of our meeting
was ſituated upon the bankes of the great River <hi>Roſne;</hi> and truly, the Lady had made
this choice with much judgement, becauſe the Maſter of it was a Servant and an Officer
unto King <hi>Euricke,</hi> who had ſerved him in his Army in matters which concerned En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
of War, having the command of Cathapaltes, Rumes, Slinges, and ſuch like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of Artillery, and moreover he was my very particular friend. The wife of
this Cavalier was in ſome ſort a kin unto <hi>Daphnide,</hi> ſo as it was almoſt impoſſible to
make choice of a fitter place, having only this inconvenience, that from our Army one
muſt paſſe ten or twelve long leagues, all through the enemies Country; and though
the danger was great, yet it was nothing when Love commanded, who cloſed my eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all dangers, rather than diſobey.</p>
                     <p>I tooke with me, him who brought me the anſwer from this faire Lady, as well for
the confidence I had in him, as for a guide, becauſe he was very well acquainted with all
the wayes of that Country: And in obedience to the Kings command, I tooke onely
two other Cavaliers with me. Thus we foure taking horſe, we ſet forward an houre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dinner, unknowne to any, for we tooke other habits, and began our journey under
the favour of Love, which was ſuch, as after we had travelled all that day, and all the
night following, we arrived at <hi>Lers</hi> about Sun riſing, where the Miſtreſſe of the houſe
received me ſo kindly, that I thought at firſt, ſhe was advertiſed of the deſigne which
brought me thither: but preſently after, I perceived ſhe knew nothing, and that all her
courteſie proceeded only from the friendſhip which ſhe knew was betwixt her husband
and me, and ſhe was extreamly inquiſitive to diſcover the cauſe of my voyage; And
therefore to colour it the better, I told her I came upon buſineſſe of great importance,
which concerned the Kings ſervice, and came by night for feare of being diſcovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
beſeeched her to conceale my name, and to keep the gates of the Caſtle cloſe ſhut, and
that when night came I would depart, if poſſibly I could: Shee being diſcreet and very
affectionate to the Kings ſervice, with whom her husband was, ſhe ordered it ſo as very few
in her houſe knew that I was <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and the more eaſily becauſe at my firſt entrance,
I changed my Name.</p>
                     <p>Halfe of the day was ſpent, and I heard no newes of the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> or at leaſt
if it was not, it ſeemed ſo unto me: After much impatient expectance, I went up into
a high Tower, ſeeming as if I deſired to view the Country, though it was only in hopes
to ſee her coming. There was not a Houſe, nor a Wood, nor a Hill, of which I did not
aske the name, the better to cover my impaciency: but nothing could divert me, though
the Lady of the houſe did all that poſſibly ſhe could to make the time ſeeme leſſe tedious
unto mee.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, after many a long look, and when I began to be cut of all hope, I ſaw a Coach
coming that way which I knew ſhe was to come, and ſhewing it unto the Lady, ſhe loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
a while upon it: At laſt, it being come a little neerer, ſhe turned towards me. If I
be not much miſtaken, ſaid ſhe unto me, the Coch comes hither, and if it be, as I think
it is, you ſhall ſee one of the greateſt beauties in all this Country: Who is it? (ſaid
I unto her very coldly) I know not, ſaid ſhe; whether you have ſeen her in the Court of
King <hi>Thoriſmond</hi> with her Mother; but if you have, I am confident you know her
name: For, though ſhe be my Coſen, yet I muſt needs, and truly ſay, that ſhe is very
faire, though ſhe was then but a child: It is, ſaid ſhe, the young <hi>Daphnide.</hi> At the firſt
I ſeemed to have but a little memory of her; but preſently after, as if I had better recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
my ſelfe: Yes, yes, ſaid I, I doe very well remember her, ſhe had then a Father
and a Mother, with whom ſhe dwelt; for ſhe was none of the Queenes women: She
was not, anſwered ſhe, and perhaps the reaſon of it was unknowne unto you,
becauſe you were then very young; but indeed it was becauſe the Queene was jealous
that <hi>Thoriſmond</hi> did looke upon her with an over-kind eye, and yet I aſſure you, ſhe
was then but a very childe, as you will judge when you ſee her, for ſhe ſeemes to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
young yet. How? Madam, ſaid I unto her, I ſee her? I beſeech you, No; leſt I
ſhould be diſcovered, uand my deſigne ſpoyled. For if it ſhould, beſides my owne ruine,
the Kings ſervice would be ſpoyled. She anſwered, that I needed not to feare it: for
<hi>Daphnide</hi> would at her requeſt be very ſecret, and her Father was a faithfull devoted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Kings: I, whoſe deſire was to ſee her, yet ſeemed to be perſwaded unto it
by her. I am, ſaid I to her ſo much devoted unto the ſervice of Ladies, as I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
any of them will doe me harme. Upon this, wee ſaw the Coach take into the way
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53527:19"/>
which conducted to the houſe, which aſſured us, that it was ſhe: And the Miſtreſſe of
the houſe, very glad of ſuch gueſts, taking me by the hand, ſaid unto me: Will it
pleaſe you, wee ſhould goe and receive them? I will put my ſelfe into their hands, ſaid
I unto her, and ſmiled: perhaps I ſhall be ſafer that way, than by reſiſtance, for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
workes moſt with generous ſoules.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt we were thus talking, the Ladies were come into the baſe Court of the Caſtle,
where the Lady of the houſe went to receive them, and told them in their eare, what
Gueſt ſhe had in her houſe, and how ſhe thought fit they ſhould know it as well as her
ſelfe. The faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> had with her two Siſters, both very fair, but both ſhort of
her: As for me, I was retired into a low Parlour, where I ſeemed unwilling to come out,
for feare of being knowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it was well I did ſo; for had I not beene alone at their
firſt coming, my actions would have diſcovered my paſſion: For when I ſaw them firſt
come out of the Coach, ſhe who came out firſt was ſo faire, as I tooke her for <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide,</hi>
and ſeeing the ſecond fairer then ſhe I recanted my firſt thought, ſaying to my ſelfe,
this was ſhe; but <hi>I</hi> reſted not long in this error, for preſently after <hi>I</hi> ſaw this faire one
come forth, who did ſo raviſh me, that <hi>I</hi> knew not what <hi>I</hi> did; but their complements
and ſalutations, gave me time to recollect my ſelfe a litle: ſo as when they came into the
houſe, I became ſo confident, that when I ſaluted them, I was able to hid my tranſport:
afterwards, addreſſing my ſelfe unto her, who had the ſole dominion of my ſoule, <hi>I</hi> ſaid
unto her; Madam, ſince fortune will have it ſo, <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe my ſelf your Priſoner: ſir,
ſaid ſhe unto me in a loud voice, we will not refuſe the advantange which we have over
you; but we rather wiſh our merits had gotten it, then our fortune. Your merits, replyed
<hi>I,</hi> may pretend unto far greater; and fortune gave you this as being much too little for
your merits. You have given me the ſame aſſurances heretofore (ſaid ſhe in a lower tone)
but in a language which ſpoke more ſincerity, then that which you now uſe. At that
time, anſwered I, I might ſpeak as a childe, but now I have more knowledge of my ſelfe,
I am ſure I ſpeak with more truth; yet if you will have it ſo, let be attributed unto for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
but I pray, ſaid ſhe, and ſmiled, how doe you think to pay the ranſome for getting
out of our hands? for you muſt never hope for liberty but by that meanes. My ranſome,
replyed I, be it never ſo great, will not be halfe ſo hard to be found, as to get my heart
conſent, that I ſhall come out of your hands. I perceive (replied ſhe, and ſmiled) you
remember yet what leſſons King <hi>Thoriſmond</hi> taught you, and can talk to Ladies as you
were then wont. So I ought to doe with you, anſwered I, ſince you have the ſame eyes,
and ſame beauties, wherewith you were wont to conquer all thoſe that durſt look upon
you: I thought, anſwered ſhe, that men of arms and blood, ſuch as follow the King <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
had onely talked of killing and murdering; but I perceive <hi>Alcidon,</hi> whereſoever he
is, is ſtill the ſame <hi>Alcidon;</hi> that is, all courteſie and civility; upon this ſhe went into the
great Chamber with all the company.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Complements being paſſed, our kind Land-lady cauſing ſeats to be brought,
ſhe placed me more out of civility, then deſign next unto <hi>Daphnide,</hi> at a little diſtance
from the reſt of the company; ſo as ſeeing my ſelfe in a place where I might ſpeak more
freely, my affection and my duty, both invited me to give her thanks for the favour of
this meeting: but when I began, ſhe interrupted me with an angry look, and laying her
hand upon my mouth, ſhe ſaid unto me; You muſt not think <hi>Alcidon,</hi> that you are any
thing obliged unto me for this viſit, becauſe I would never have conſented unto it, but
onely out of a deſign to puniſh you, knowing that ſince you did love me, when I was a
meer childe, you will now be ready to die for the love of me, ſeeing me more improved.
This is the true cauſe which moved me unto this meeting, I meane to chaſtiſe you, and
not to gratifie you; for having rendred your ſelfe ſo unworthy of thoſe favours which I
conferred upon, I will try whether chaſtiſements will make you better know your duty
both unto me and your ſelfe. Can you think, forgetful lover, that after ſo many expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of favour and love, that my beauty deſerves to be forgotten; and that in two long
years, no ſpark of any memory ſhould appeare? Doe you thinke perfidious man, that
ſo long a ſilence can be excuſed by the miſeries of the time? Wars, and all impediments
whatſoever, cannot perſwade me but that it is ſome defect in affection, and not any reall
excuſe. I know that if I would permit it, you will flow with excuſes; but I forbid you
to ſpeak; not that I feare your language can perſwade me, but becauſe I am reſolved not
to believe you; and becauſe I will not let you have ſo much content, as to ſpeak any thing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53527:20"/>
before me which ſhall pleaſe you: By this you may know, that this meeting for which you
think your ſelfe obliged unto me, reſembles ſweet poyſon, which by ſweetneſſe gives
death. I offered to anſwer, but <hi>I</hi> no ſooner opened my mouth, but ſhe checked me, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
what <hi>Alcidon,</hi> doe you care as little for diſobliging me in my preſence, as in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?
No, no, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> that is not the way to win upon <hi>Daphnide</hi> What then, ſaid I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her, is it your pleaſure <hi>I</hi> ſhould do? To ſuffer, ſaid ſhe, and be ſilent. For it is fit you
ſhould expiate your ſinne of ſilence, by ſilence Upon this, <hi>I</hi> was mute; yet ſhewing by my
lookes that my heart was troubled, that <hi>I</hi> might not ſpeak in my own defence. She on
the contrary, looking with a little more favourable eye, after a while of ſilence, began
thus:</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Daphnide</hi> whom you ſee before your face, forgetful <hi>Alcidon,</hi> is the very ſame ſhee
was, when you firſt made ſo many oathes of fidelity unto her; the very ſame who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
you; the very ſame whoſe hands you ſo oft waſhed in your then innocent teares. But
to your ſhame, ſhe is able to ſay, that ſhe has kept her faith without the leaſt ſtain, though
ſhe hath ſince had ſo many occaſions to hate you ſhe has ſtill continued her love to you,
and entertaines in her ſoul thoſe aſſurances which you gave unto her: and though ſhe
has had many inducements to caſt you quite off, yet her heart would never conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, being reſolved rather to part from her life, then thoſe pledges which you gave her of
your fidelity. Theſe eyes which have been ſo often idolized by the young <hi>Alcidon,</hi> have
been witneſſes of many a teare ſhed for your long abſence, when I remembred your
young promiſes, which now <hi>I</hi> find to be ſo falſe: for you never had the leaſt ſparke of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
or thought of her, unto whom you promiſed eternal memory. Oh <hi>Alcidon;</hi> you
ſhall heare how <hi>I</hi> have lived ſince the death of the great King, unto whom both you
and I were ſo much, obliged; and you will confeſſe, if you be not the moſt unjuſt man
that ever breathed, that your ſilence hath made you unworthy of love, but that my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is ſtill greater then your offence:</p>
                     <p>Then ſhe began to repeat all paſſages, ſince the beginning of our ſeparation unto this
meeting, not omitting any circumſtance that argued my oblivion, wherewith ſhe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
me: and on the other ſide, to teſtifie the memory ſhe had of me, ſhe related all the
remarkable actions that I had done: and after a long repetition of them, at which I
was amazed, that ſhe ſhould know ſo many particulars: I perceive, ſaid ſhe, that you
are amazed <hi>I</hi> ſhould relate your own life unto you; but had you beene as you ought, <hi>I</hi>
ſhould have come to the knowledge of them from your ſelfe, and not from others, which
argues a defect in your affection, and your ſilence is a ſigne of your ſhameful forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>She had continued thus upbraiding me, and in relating both her own life and mine,
very near two hours, and would not ſuffer me to open my mouth in my own defence, nor
to anſwer her. At laſt, this offended beauty finding ſome proofe of the power which ſhe
had over me, ſhe began to change her countenance and language. Now <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
<hi>I</hi> permit you to ſpeak, being contented with two hours ſilence in my preſence, in exchange
of two yeares voluntary ſilence in my abſence. It argues your abundant goodneſſe, ſaid
<hi>I</hi> unto her, and ſmiled, that you will thus change years into hours. Your crime is ſuch,
replyed ſhe, that no puniſhment can equall it: but <hi>I</hi> will ſhew my ſelfe as merciful, as <hi>I</hi>
am able to puniſh you if <hi>I</hi> will.</p>
                     <p>Madam, ſaid <hi>I</hi> unto her, <hi>I</hi> ſhould kiſſe your faire hands, by way of thankes for ſuch
extraordinary favours, were <hi>I</hi> not afraid <hi>I</hi> ſhould be perceived, but <hi>I</hi> lay my heart at your
feet, in teſtimony of my gratitude; I doe moſt ingenuouſly confeſſe, Madam, the fault
wherewith you charge me. But if your goodneſſe would be pleaſed to let me tell you the
occaſion and reaſon why I was ſo long ſilent, perhaps you would thinke me as worthy
of commendations, as of blame. Since I have pardoned you, (ſaid ſhe) and given you
leave to ſpeake, you may ſay what you pleaſe; and I wiſh you may ſhew ſuch reaſons as
may perſwade me, that you are in no fault. Let me ſay then, (continued I) that you may
well conceive, <hi>I</hi> grieved extreamly at the death of a Maſter, who loved me ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
and raiſed me by his favours above the reach of all Court Envy. Now I ſhould
have extreamly offended againſt his memory and the offence would have been thought
high ingratitude, if I ſhould have entertained the leaſt kind of contentment in my ſoule:
Times of mourning injoynes us unto ſad habits, and forbids any thing of joy or content.
Now the poor and diſconſolate <hi>Alcidon,</hi> was forbidden all manner of happineſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53527:20"/>
himſelfe of all that came from you Madam, who was and is his only joy and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
To ſatisfie then, both my duty and my affection, I made choice of ſo bidding my
ſelfe the honour of hearing from you, to the end nothing ſhould divert me from my ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which was then ſeaſonable. But Loves knowes, and that miſerable heart which
loves and adores you, knowes, that in the midſt of my bitter ſorrowes, none grieved me
ſo much as that I was diſtanced from your preſence and memory. Two things princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
may argue the truth of this unto you. Firſt, if I had not truly loved you, my age
would not have permitted me to live ſo long amongſt ſo many faire Ladies without love.
Secondly, as ſoone as I had in ſome ſort forgotten my ſorrowes for my great loſſe, my
continuall thoughts of you, would never let me be in quietneſſe untill I had the honour of
ſeeing you: The danger of the journey, nor the diſtance from the great <hi>Euricke,</hi> whoſe
favours ſhine upon me as faſt as thoſe did from <hi>Thoriſmond,</hi> could not hinder me. Now
Madam, I proſtrate my ſelfe at your feet, reſigning unto you all my affections, all my
thoughts, my heart and ſoule, beſeeching you to receive them, not as any new offering
or freſh acquiſition, but as yours from my infancy; my Deſtiny, my Maſter and my
heart, did give me unto you. I ſhall receive your excuſe ſaid ſhe unto me, as they uſe to
receive a debt from a bad pay-maſter, though the money be a little too light: and I will
beleeve what you ſay, upon condition that none of your future actions give me any cauſe
of doubt.</p>
                     <p>When I would have anſwered, I was hindred by the Lady of the houſe, who came to
tell us it was Supper time; therefore we referred the reſt of our diſcourſe till after it was
done. And it was no ſooner ended, but I out of civility falling into diſcourſe with
one of her Siſters, ſhe came unto us, and having ſeparated me a little from the reſt, we
fell into talke where we left, with ſo much contentment unto me, that I muſt needs
confeſſe my joyes were never greater. Thus we ſpent part of the night; at laſt, bed time
forcing us to part, we adviſed upon a more ſafe place of meeting; and being conſtrained to
depart in the morning, it was now long before we could reſolve upon the place: At the laſt,
ſhe ſaid unto me, but in a very doubtfull manner: I am loath, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> to put you into
any danger, but ſince you are ſo urgent upon it, I will tell you, that I have a Siſter mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
within five or ſix Leagues of this place, where we might very well meet, were it
not that my brother in law is an Enemy unto King <hi>Euricke,</hi> yet were there no other
difficulty but that, we might find a remedy; but as ill lucke is, he hath invited a
great Company to the marriage of one of his Siſters, ſo as all things ſeeme contrary
unto us: I do not think there is one of any quality in all the Province, which is not an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
unto the King your Maſter. I muſt confeſſe Father, I found much danger this way,
but when I conſidered that there was no other way to enjoy the company of my Miſtreſſe,
danger was the leaſt of my thoughts, and therefore I anſwered her: That no hazard
ſhould make me loſe the happineſſe, ſo ſhe would but command it; onely beſeeched her
to take ſuch order, that when I was in the houſe, none ſhould ſee me; for I was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that under her command I ſhould receive no harme.</p>
                     <p>In this reſolution we parted, and the next morning leaving one of her Servants with
me, who was very truſty; ſhe departed, and I had not the honour to ſee her purpoſely
to take away all ſuſpition from the Lady of the houſe. As for me, I departed with my
guide, ſome three hours within night: after many thankes unto my Hoſteſſe for her kind
uſage, I ſhall not here relate the various encounters I had by the way: The place unto
which I was conducted was one of the moſt ſolitary ſeats in all the Country, and the
fitteſt for any interpriſes of love.</p>
                     <p>Upon the bankes of that great River of <hi>Roſne,</hi> do ſtand many faire Townes, which
take delight in her waves; one of the beſt and moſt peopled is <hi>Avignion,</hi> ſome five or
ſix Leagues from whence towards the eaſt is a Valley, which being incloſed on three ſides
by high Hils and great Rockes, was at the firſt called <hi>Vale cloſe,</hi> and afterwards by
corruption of language, of which the vulgar is alwayes Maſter, it was called <hi>Vaucluſe;</hi>
at the end of this Valley, under huge Rockes, and by a wonderfull Fountaine which
gives a beginning to the River of <hi>Sorgues,</hi> which a little below parts it ſelfe into two
Arms, like a little Iſland, where this houſe unto which I was to goe did ſtand, and
which ſtanding betweene two Rivers, has the name of an Iſland. The place from whence
this Fountain ſprings, is truly for its ſolitude, in ſome ſort venerable; but ſomething
terrible by reaſon of the Rockes which inviron it, and therefore very little frequented
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53527:21"/>
by people. It was here where my guide brought me to alight from my horſe, and to leave
thoſe who came with me, which by my command, though with ſorrow, they did.
From this ſource unto the Iſle is about a quarter of a League, which I was to walke on
foot, and in the night, which I did in ſuch doubts and incertainties, that love made
it appeare in me, how not onely himſelfe is blind, but he takes ſight alſo from all thoſe
who are his ſubjects. At the laſt, about the eighth or ninth hour of the night, we came
unto the Garden doore which belonged unto the houſe, which though it was promiſed
me ſhould be left open, yet it was ſhut; judge <hi>Adamas,</hi> what I thought of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then, and whether I had not reaſon to expect <hi>Mars</hi> in lieu of <hi>Venus.</hi> But after a
long doubtfull expectance, I heard the doore open, and the firſt thing that preſented
it ſelfe unto my eyes, was a fair Lady, decked as Painters uſe to doe the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana.</hi>
her haire looſe, her breſt and ſhoulders naked, her ſleeves turned up as high as the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boe;
gilded buskins upon her legs; her, Quiver by her ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Bow of Ivory in her left
hand. I was raviſhed at ſo fair a ſight, and admired her habit; but I underſtood ſince that
ſhe was ſo diſguiſed like <hi>Diana,</hi> for Name ſake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe ſhe was called <hi>Delia,</hi> which is one
of <hi>Dianas</hi> names, purpoſely to daunce that night with her Siſters, and other young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
there, in honour of the great Aſſembly. As ſoone as ever ſhe ſaw me come in, ſaid
ſhe unto me, and tooke my hand; Come in and attempt this dangerous adventure under
the conduct of <hi>Diana,</hi> Under the banner of ſuch a Goddeſſe, anſwered I, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which I will not attempt. Some interpriſes, ſaid ſhe, do ſeeme eaſie at the firſt,
which afterwards are ſound full of difficulty, and take heed leſt this be of that quality:
If this were not of great importance, replyed I, I would never have come ſo farre to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it. I am very glad, ſaid ſhe, to finde you in that reſolution; and know that both
Love and Fortune will aſſiſt a couragious ſoule; and to ſhew how deſirous I am you
ſhould bring your enterpriſe to paſſe, I will give you ſafe conduct from all that are in
this enchanted houſe, unleſſe from the eyes of your Miſtreſſe, and from this <hi>Diana</hi>
who ſpeakes unto you. I doe accept of this aſſurance, ſaid I unto her: Well, (ſaid ſhe)
before you have done with this adventure, we ſhall ſee what your Fortune will be, and
what your courage: In the meane time, valiant Cavalier, enter, but ſtill enter upon
ſuch conditions as thoſe who enter, uſe. I beſeech you, ſaid I unto her, what are thoſe
conditions? You ſhall know, anſwered ſhe, when you are entred. Why, ſaid I, are
you afraid to tell them, leaſt they ſhould affright me? If ſo, faire <hi>Diana,</hi> you are
miſtaken: For I will undertake any conditions, ſo they doe not contrary that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which I have vowed unto my Miſtreſſe. Upon this, I entred in alone, ſhe lockt the
doore, and my Guide returned through the Rockes of <hi>Vaucluſe.</hi> Now was I alone
with <hi>Delia</hi> in the Garden; and I muſt confeſſe, that ſhe was ſo advantaged by this
odde fantaſticall dreſſe, as ſhe might very well be termed faire, and one that was not
prepoſſeſſed might well have found a heart to love her: She ſeeing me ſtand ſo mute,
looking upon her, and thinking it was my impatience becauſe ſhe carried me no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
unto the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> ſhe ſmiled, and ſaid unto me. What Sir, were you bold
at your entrance, and now ſhow ſo little courage to accompliſh your adventure? What
fault faire <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid I unto her, doe you finde in my courage, what muſt I doe?
and againſt whom muſt I ſhew my valour? How, ſaid ſhe, and ſet her Arms upon
her ſides, have you not before your eyes an enemy fierce enough to make you put your
hand to your Armes? I muſt confeſſe faire Goddeſſe, ſaid I, that you are a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Enemy unto one that has a heart, but certainly againſt me your Arms have no
edge, ſince the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> has long ſince deprived me of my heart. How, ſaid ſhe,
is there no hopes of gaining any thing from you? You may hope, replyed I, to gaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that I have, you meane, ſaid ſhe, any thing but your heart. Well, well
<hi>Alcidon,</hi> you are not yet in a good faith; but before you eſcape my hands, I will make
you uſe other language: I have met with ſome, who at the firſt have ſaid as you doe, and
yet before all was done did ſubmit themſelves as conquered: ſuch as thoſe, anſwered I,
either did but lend their, heart, or if they did give it, did ſteale it back againe to give it
unto you, but I cannot doe ſo, who have not only given away my heart, but my will,
my ſoule, and my life alſo. Had you any courage, as you tax me for having none, you
would not imploy your valour and your ſtrength againſt one that is without defence, as
I am: What honour will it be to vanquiſh one that is already vanquiſhed? one that has
no heart; this were to ſtrike one that is dying by the wounds of another. Come, come
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53527:21"/>
my heartleſſe enemy, ſaid ſhe unto me, I know you would have me carry you preſently
unto <hi>Daphnide;</hi> but doe not thinke <hi>Alcidon,</hi> that our emnity is ſo great, but I woud
have done it before now, if it had been time; doe you ſee yonder window which ſtand
out further then the reſt? there is <hi>Daphnides</hi> Chamber; when it is time for you to goe
there will be a Candle ſet in it to advertiſe us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but aſſure your ſelfe, that as you think the
time long here, your Miſtreſs thinks it longer where ſhe is, having abundance of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
perſons, who ſwarme about her like ſo many flies, eſpecially her brother in law, who
thinking to doe her a pleaſure, never ſtirs from her: Come, come, you that are a very
finely accompliſhed Cavalier, methinks you ſhould not be weary of my company, many
have told me that I am pretty hanſome, and I am in an humour to treat you ſo, that
what you will not doe by faire meanes, I will make you doe by force: I meane, I will in
ſpite of you, keep you from being weary. I muſt confeſſe once again (ſaid I unto her)
that it is impoſſible for any one that has a heart, not to love you. For, faire <hi>Delia,</hi> there
are ſo many admirable perfections in you, as look which way one will, one ſhall be ſure
to find abundance of invitements to love.</p>
                     <p>You think ſtill (ſaid ſhe unto me) to eſcape my hands with this excuſe, but before we
part, I will make you find another and therefore what will you ſay next <hi>Alcidon?</hi> I will ſay,
replyed I, that you can do miracles, which need not be thought ſtrange; for your beauty
equalling the power of the great Gods, you may doe them as well as they: but will you
give me leave to ſpeak freely? with all my heart, anſwered ſhe, for you ſee I do the like:
Then fair <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid I, let me tell you, the Moon is the moſt glorious lamp that now
ſhines in the heaven (the moon then ſhining) and if there was no Sun, none could deny,
but that it would be alwaies ſo: I confeſſe it, ſaid <hi>Delia,</hi> what doe you infer by that? I
infer, replyed I, That the fair <hi>Diana</hi> unto whom now I ſpeak, would be the faireſt in the
world, had ſhe not a ſiſter, and there is none but ſhe which hinders her from the title of
the faireſt. Could I as eaſily believe that, ſaid ſhe, as I am ambitious of that title where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
you ſpeak, I vow Cavalier by theſe Arrowes and Bow, that if I could not kill her with
my own hands, I would poyſon that ſiſter who eclipſeth my beauty; but I am afraid, that
if ſhe were taken away, it would happen unto me, as unto the Moon, in abſence of her
brother the Sun, become obſcure and pale. I ſhould have anſwered, when the ſo much
deſired light appeared in the window, and my affection carrying my eyes almoſt alwaies
that way, would not let me loſe ſo much time as to anſwer her when I ſaw it. Shewing
it therefore unto <hi>Delia,</hi> I beſeeched her to accompliſh the favour which ſhe had begun.
I will, ſaid ſhe unto me, and took my hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you know it is the office of the Moon, whoſe
Name I bear, to clear the Night, and to be a guide unto thoſe who wander. My life, ſaid
I unto her, is obliged unto your ſervice, though I am afraid that obligation is little worth,
ſince you are carrying me unto one whoſe beauty kills all thoſe that looke upon her:
and being accuſtomed to ſee men languiſh and die, it is not likely ſhe will have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
of my paine. Thoſe, ſaid ſhe, whom I take unto my protection, are never ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for if they were, I ſhould not have opened the doore unto you: and beleeve it, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
carry any to their puniſhment: And whereas you feare that her beauty will kill you,
never feare that fortune good Cavalier, your Arms are very good, and tryed: for ſuch as
will die at ſight of beauty, will die at the ſight of me; ſo as you having paſt that danger,
never fear any beauty living will kill you.</p>
                     <p>Thus we went talking in a low voice, until we came to the houſe, which was the
happy habitation of my Miſtreſſe; and finding a door open, we went up a paire of narrow
ſtaires, unto the Chamber door, with as little noiſe as poſſibly we could: Then <hi>Delia</hi>
cauſed me to ſtay, and went in alone to ſee who was there, but ſhe found onely the faire
<hi>Daphnide</hi> by her ſelfe, who faigning to be troubled with the head-ake, was laid downs
upon her bed, purpoſely to be rid of the company; and pretending that the light was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
to her, ſhe cauſed the Candle to be ſet in the window; <hi>Delia</hi> came preſently unto
me, and taking my hand, carried me to her ſiſters bed ſide, and ſaid unto her; ſee <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide,</hi>
what <hi>Diana</hi> has taken in her laſt chaſe: I muſt confeſſe, ſaid I unto her, and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that I am yours, if a heart could be divided into two: but ſince mine is in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of my faireſt Miſtreſs onely, I am come to render it unto her, vowing never to take
it out of ſo ſweet a priſon. In this, ſaid <hi>Delia,</hi> you ſhew the weakneſſe of your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſince you had rather give your ſelfe unto a Nimph as <hi>Daphnide</hi> is, than unto a
Goddeſſe as I am, nay <hi>Diana,</hi> who is the Miſtreſs of all the Nymphs, <hi>Jupiter, Apollo,</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:53527:22"/>
and almoſt all the Gods, ſaid I unto her, have ſlighted Goddeſſes, and courted Nymphs.
But never was any ſo faire as this, into whoſe hands I do ſubmit my ſoul &amp; my life: upon
this, kneeling down, I took her hand and kiſſed it often, whilſt ſhe was ſo tranſported that
ſhe gave no anſwer; which <hi>Delia</hi> perceiving, ſiſter, ſaid ſhe, will you let this Cavalier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
you indeed and kneel till his knees ake, before you give him any anſwer? Then
rowſing her ſelfe as out of a deep ſlumber, ſhe ſaluted me, and afterwards anſwered her
ſiſter. I hope <hi>Delia,</hi> this Cavalier will pardon the fault, and not thinke it proceeded from
any incivility, but from my feares of that danger which he is in for my cauſe. I admire,
(ſaid <hi>Delia</hi>) that you being my ſiſter, ſhould be ſuch a coward, whereas I am ſo ſtout as
to take priſoner the braveſt Cavalier in all the Army of the great <hi>Eurick;</hi> how can you
want courage, having (as he ſayes) the heart of the valiant <hi>Alcidon?</hi> Ah <hi>Delia,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, and ſighed, it is a bad ſigne for me, to ſee my Miſtreſs ſo ſaint, for it ſhewes ſhe has
not my heart; for if ſhe had, ſhe would rather pitty my miſery which ſhe has cauſed, then
feare any dangers wherein I am. Could I <hi>Alcidon,</hi> anſwered my faire Miſtreſs, remedy
the one, as well as I can the other, you had reaſon to thinke ſo: but conſider, that if I
did not love this Cavalier, who complaines thus of me, I ſhould neither be in theſe feares
wherein I am, nor he in the danger wherein he is. I anſwered her, If you ſpeak from your
heart, Madam, then cure me of the malady which proceeds from your ſelfe; and never
doubt that I can receive any harme, as long as I am in the honour of your favour:
<hi>Delia</hi> then ſmiled, and ſaid; I perceive that when you have been together a little, the
pain of the one will be changed into contentment, and the feares into confidence. But leſt
fortune ſhould hinder your deſignes, ſpeak as low as you can, and I will go and ſit by
the Candle, ſeeming to read, that I may put it out, if any chance to come; or elſe I will
fall in talk with them; and tell them how you doe, without bidding enter. But Cavalier,
ſaid ſhe, and addreſſed her ſelfe unto me, Remember the promiſe which you made when
I opened the door unto you, and admitted you unto this adventure, which was, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the conditions then propoſed, and if you be worthy of the name of a Cavalier, you
will keep your word. You have kept your promiſe ſo well with me, anſwered I, that I
were a moſt unworthy recreant, if I did not the ſame with you. Then, ſaid ſhe unto me,
you are obliged according to the conditions eſtabliſhed, not to attempt any thing, upon
any occaſion, nor for any reſpect or reward whatſoever, againſt the honour of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
who are here; but on the contrary, you ought to be contented with thoſe favours
which they confer upon you, not ſeeking or deſiring any greater. I will ſooner ſheathe my
ſword in my heart, anſwered I, then entertain a thought againſt this ordinance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Every
Cavalier of honour, is obliged unto it by his very Name: for that reſpect is due, as unto
one of the principal ſtatutes of love. I ever thought, anſwered <hi>Delia,</hi> of <hi>Alcidons</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion;
and I doe exceedingly rejoyce, you doe thus ſecond my thoughts, ſince the law
had not been eſtabliſhed but for you. How? ſaid I, not eſtabliſhed but for me? was it
made onely to reſtrain my indiſcretion? Is it thought that I am more impudent than
any of the Knight errantry? That is not the reaſon, ſaid ſhe unto me; but is it not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
this conſtraint ſhould be eſtabliſhed for you onely in this adventure, which you terme
the adventure of perfect love, ſince you onely are permitted to attempt it? But ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you have done, you are to deal with a fiercer Champion then I am, I will leave you
together with your enemy, leſt you ſhould complain of diſadvantage.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, not ſtaying for my anſwer, ſhe went away, and ſat down with a book in
her hand, and left my faireſt miſtreſſe and me together, as ſhe ſaid ſhe would. At which
I being tranſported with abundance of contentment, after I was ſet down upon the bed
by her, I tooke her hand, and kiſſing it many times, I ſaid unto her: Madam I am moſt
ſenſible of my extreame obligations, and my life is too little a price to be paid for ſuch a
happineſſe. Did you kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> what paines I have taken, ſaid ſhe, to give you this teſtimony
of my good will, doubtleſſe you would ſet a good value of eſteem upon it. For though my
ſiſter does now ſhew her ſelfe ſo ſtout in the matter; yet believe me, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſhe is not
alwaies ſo, and it was not weak perſwaſions which could make her conſent unto it. Oh
what artifice and tricks have I uſed to deceive, not onely my brother in law, but all his
kindred and friends, or indeed all the whole Province. Conſider, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> what a ſtrange
reſolution I had in putting my honour and your life into ſo great a danger: For to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your coming into this place is no leſſe. Madam, ſaid I, and kiſſed her hand, if you
conſider my extream affection unto you, Love, and You were unjuſt, if you did not anſwer
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53527:22"/>
it by extraordinary proofes of your good acceptance, and I doe confeſſe, that this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
my merit, though it doe not equall my affection. For it is ſuch, that moſt certaine
death cannot make me ſtart from your ſervice. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> anſwered ſhe, if your affection
be ſuch as you ſay, I wiſh it may continue as long as I live. But I doe much feare
the love of a young heart. Madam, ſaid I unto her, doubts uſe to enter into the ſoules of
thoſe who are not well grounded in their Faith; and theſe in you give me more cauſe
to fear weakneſſe of affection on your ſide; for the principal effect of true love is, to remove
out of the Lover all manner of miſtruſt of the perſon loved, and it is impoſſible to love one
whom they miſtruſt.</p>
                     <p>By this, replyed ſhe, you may know the grandure of my affection, ſince having ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
occaſions to doubt you, yet is it ſtill ſtronger then all thoſe doubtfull occaſions, and
makes me ſtill give you ſuch teſtimonies of my good will. Yet Madam, ſaid I unto her,
give me leave to ſay in mine owne defence, that you doe wrong my love, in taxing it
with youngneſſe, for I am twice ten years of age. Ah <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, before any good
aſſurance can be, you had need be twice twelve. At this I laughed and ſaid: that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
were indeed requiſite in thoſe who love common beauties; but for you and I, time
is not ſo much to be inſiſted upon; for our ties and obligations are as ſtrong now, as they
will be foure yeares hence. She would have replyed, when <hi>Delia</hi> began to cough, as an
advertiſement, that ſhe heard ſome coming: preſently after, her brother in law came to
the doore, unto whom ſhe made a ſigne with her finger, and went as ſoftly to him as ſhe
could, as if ſhe were afraid to wake her ſiſter; her brother in law asked her how <hi>Daphni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>
did. She complained a long while, ſaid ſhe unto him, and now ſhe is fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep.
What, ſaid he, will you not come downe and dance? to what end did you elſe
dreſſe your ſelfe in that habit? I hope brother, anſwered ſhe, that my ſiſter will be well
after ſhe has ſlept a while, and if ſhe be, I will come and finiſh our deſigne with the reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but if ſhe continue ill, we muſt deferre it until another time, and if you will come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
about halfe an hour hence, I ſhall tell you more: upon this her brother in law went
away, and ſhe came unto us to tell us what he had ſaid, and when I deſired her to defer
it until to morrow; ſhe anſwered me, I perceive <hi>Alcidon</hi> that you are all for your ſelfe,
and care not for the intereſts of another, ſo you can enjoy your opportunities as long as
you ſtay, you care not what becomes of us when you are gone. You doe not well, ſaid
<hi>Daphnide</hi> to make this conſtruction of what this Cavalier ſaid; for I am moſt confident
he has more care of us then ſo; but if he love us, as I beleeve he does, he will not take
it ill, if we leave him a little without company; I conceive it therefore beſt, that when
my brother in law comes againe, you tell him that <hi>I</hi> am better then <hi>I</hi> was, and that if
he will come, and dance here, <hi>I</hi> ſhall be very glad of it, ſo he bring with him as few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and as little Muſique as he can; in the mean time, we will put <hi>Alcidon</hi> into this
Cloſet which is cloſe by my bed.</p>
                     <p>This Counſell was approved of as good, and to ſhew me this Cloſet ſhe tooke the
Key, and not ſtirring from off her bed, ſhe opened the doore, and cauſing a Candle to be
brought, ſhewed it unto me, where I found roome onely for two Chaires and a Table.
The place was fretted and gilded, and very handſomely furniſhed; in this place, ſaid
ſhe unto me, you may be with ſafety, and if you will leave the doore a little open, you
may ſee us dance: though you muſt not expect to find the magnificence of the great <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
yet I am confident this Ball will not be diſpleaſing unto you, by reaſon of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
habits and new inventions. To which I anſwered, that nothing would be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
unto me, that pleaſed her.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt we were thus talking, the Brother in law returned, and ſo ſoftly leaſt he ſhould
wake <hi>Daphnide,</hi> that he had almoſt ſurpriſed us: But <hi>Delia,</hi> who firſt heard him, did
put out the candle, leaſt he ſhould ſee, and ſpeaking a little louder, Brother, ſaid ſhe,
have but a little patience, and my ſiſter will dance with us, ſhe is awake, and ſo well as
ſhe will come and ſee us, will you not, Siſter, ſaid ſhe, and addreſſed her ſelfe to my
Miſtreſſe. Yes Siſter, anſwered ſhe, but Brother I beſeech you, come hither to dance,
and bring as few people, and little Muſicke as you can; for I am afraid leaſt the noiſe
ſhould cauſe my head to ake againe. The brother was very glad of this newes, and
went in all haſte to tell the company: in the meane time I had le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

little habitation, and ſhe to draw the Curtaines, and order all things ſo as none could ſee
me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet I could ſee almoſt all that was done in the Chamber.</p>
                     <p>We had no ſooner put all things into order, but a great number of Cavaliers came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53527:23"/>
to the Chamber, with many faire Ladies, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Stiliana</hi> and <hi>Carlis,</hi> who
have accompanied my Miſtreſſe hither. After ſome paſſages of civility (for it muſt be
confeſſed that the Cavaliers of the Roman Province are the moſt courteous of all <hi>Gaule</hi>)
every one began to talke as the humour tooke them: At laſt they fell into talke of the
King <hi>Euricke,</hi> and his Wars; which they being all exceedingly ſenſible of, there was not
one in all the company, who had not ſome paſſionate invective againſt that great King.
The beſt language any had for him, was to call him Barbarous, Cruell, the Ruiner of
<hi>Gaule,</hi> and all <hi>Europe;</hi> and then fell to wiſhes: One wiſhed that he were his Priſoner;
another to ſee him dead; a third, that all his Armie were routed; and the beſt wiſh was,
that he had never beene. All this diſcourſe I heard, and judge what would have beene
my entertainment had they found me. I beleeve they had not ſo ſoon left talking of this
great King, and their paſſions had not been ſo ſoon layed, had they not heard the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,
which let them know that <hi>Delia</hi> and her Companions were ready to dance. Then
every one tooke their places, and preſently after, thoſe faire ones entred in ſuch an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
trim, and with ſuch a delicate new Aire, as I muſt needs confeſſe I never ſaw any
thing more full of taking delight. I cannot now inſiſt upon any particulars, more than
concernes the ſtory in hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely let me tell you that though all was well performed,
and full of various delights, yet I could not chuſe but thinke the time long, and wiſhed
for an end of this Maske, becauſe I thought it ſtole that time from me, which might be
better imployed, At laſt, the Ball ended, and the God of ſleepe commanded all the
company to retire. <hi>Delia</hi> onely ſtayed in the Chamber with her Siſter; and then the
Priſoner of Love came out of his Priſon, chiding <hi>Delia</hi> for being ſo long in her dances.
Oh what bad company is this Cavaliere (ſaid ſhe) I am confident not one in
the Company is weary but yourſelfe. But ſiſter, ſince he is ſo dumpiſh. I advice you to
packe him hence, for how can you hope to content him alone, ſince all this company
had much adoe to afford it him? Siſter, ſaid <hi>Daphnide</hi> faintly, all things upon earth
cannot afford us contentment, if it doe not come of our ſelves: As all the drugs in the
Univerſe, cannot cure a body, if that body by its owne diſpoſition be not apt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to it: And ſo <hi>Alcidon,</hi> if he will have contentment, muſt content himſelfe and
not thinke that a great number of people can doe it. Madam, anſwered I, If I
had my will in my owne power, as others have, I ſhould doe as you doe ſay; but
ſince I have put my will into your hands, my contentment muſt depend only upon you:
Siſter, ſaid <hi>Delia,</hi> and ſmiled, doe not repent of the time you have kept this Cavaliere ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
up by your bed ſide, for methinkes he hath learned to ſpeake very well.</p>
                     <p>After ſome other diſcourſe, they concluded to put me into the Cloſet againe; untill
they were undreſt, and their maids in the Chamber were gone; but when they opened
the doore unto me, I found <hi>Delia</hi> in bed with her ſiſter, and ſhe taking notice that I was
not well pleaſed at it: What Cavaliere, ſaid ſhe unto me, why doe you frowne upon
me? It is your ſelfe that is the cauſe of my being here. I doe perceive, anſwered I, that
<hi>I</hi> am the cauſe, and <hi>I</hi> cannot be ſorry for it, ſince my faireſt Miſtreſſe will have it ſo. The
truth is, <hi>I</hi> ſhould have been very glad, if <hi>I</hi> could have ſpoke unto her without a witneſſe:
Doe you not know, ſaid ſhe, that there ſhould be Witneſſes unto all good Contracts.
Love, replyed <hi>I,</hi> never needs any witneſſes, and love will ſerve us for witneſſe, if you
need any: Love, ſaid ſhe, cannot be a Witneſſe, for he is Judge. If Love, replyed I,
cannot be a Witneſſe in matters of Love; much leſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> who is alwayes a declared
enemy. Though <hi>I</hi> cannot be a witneſſe, ſaid ſhe, yet <hi>I</hi> may be the Executioner of the
puniſhment. If you deſign that, anſwered <hi>I,</hi> have <hi>I</hi> not a good occaſion to deſire you
not here? <hi>Daphnide,</hi> who had not ſpoken all this while, interrupted us, and addreſſing
her ſelfe unto me; It was <hi>I Alcidon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, that appointed her to be there, and my
reaſon for it, is ſo much to your advantage, as when you know it, you will not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry;
for it is not to witneſſe againſt you, nor accuſe you: <hi>I</hi> am fully aſſured of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi>
diſeretion, and of the power which he hath given me over him: but being more in
doubt of my ſelfe, then of you, <hi>I</hi> deſired her preſence to keep me from doing more than <hi>I</hi>
was reſolved, and leſt my good will to you, ſhould make me goe beyond the limits of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and fittingneſſe. <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe Madam, ſaid <hi>I</hi> unto her, that theſe feares in you, are
a great honour unto me, but the remedy which you apply is very cruell and vexatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s.
<hi>Alcidon,</hi> anſwered ſhe, you muſt love me, as <hi>I</hi> love you, and know that ſhe who deſerves
your love, ought not only to be without blame, but alſo without ſuſpition of any blame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:53527:23"/>
We talked ſo long, and with ſo much delight upon this ſubject, as <hi>I</hi> took no notice how
day began to break: and then, the conſultation was, whether <hi>I</hi> ſhould depart or ſtay.
The faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> who was ſtill apprehenſive of my being in any danger, ſhe was at
the firſt, of an opinion with <hi>Delia,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> ſhould be gone before it was any lighter: but
when <hi>I</hi> hinted unto her that perhaps, it would be long before ſuch another opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſeeing her would be found; ſhe conſented unto my ſtay, though <hi>Delia</hi> was of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
mind. But love being above all reaſons, it was reſolved that <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſtay that day
in this place, and that when night came <hi>I</hi> might depart with more ſafety: And to the
end <hi>I</hi> ſhould not ſtay alone in my little priſon, the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> reſolved to keep her
bed all day, and ſeem as if ſhe were not well: for this Cloſet was ſo near her beds head,
as we could talke together without being heard by any in the Chamber. This being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
upon, <hi>Delia</hi> undertook to acquaint my guide with all neceſſary inſtructions what
to doe, and to appoint thoſe Cavaliers to keep themſelves cloſe till night.</p>
                     <p>Having often heard our Druids diſcourſe of the Great <hi>Tautates,</hi> and of the immortal
ſoules of men, who after this life do ſit within heaven, where they remaine for ever: I
wondered, but could not comprehend that ſuch a life ſhould be delightfull, ſince they ſay,
that they never eat nor drinke, or ſleep, or any thing elſe, but perpetually thinke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template,
thinking that time ſhould ſeem very tedious unto them, ſince it is ſo long even
paſt all imagination. But I muſt confeſſe, that now I know the contrary, when I conſider
how quickly and pleaſingly hours paſſed away, when I was ſo near this faire one; for I
was aſtoniſhed when I ſaw it was day, thinking the night not an hour long, ſo quickly
had the time flown away.</p>
                     <p>Every one of the houſe being up, <hi>Delia</hi> was conſtrained to the like, and I muſt be cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered
up in my cloſet: for ſhe would not ſuffer me to ſee when ſhe dreſſed her ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of her maids who waited upon her. I would gladly have done the office of her
maid, and helped her, but ſhe would not permit it: <hi>Delia</hi> alſo was againſt it, and bad me
get into my Cage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I pray Love, ſaid I, be revenged upon you for it: Love, ſaid ſhe, has
nothing to doe with <hi>Diana.</hi> No? ſaid I; yet <hi>Diana</hi> quitted heaven for a kiſſe of <hi>Endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion;</hi>
and ſhe was not ſo coy, but for a fleece of Wool ſhe was very kind unto <hi>Pan,</hi> though
he had a cloven foot and hornes on his head. Let that <hi>Diana</hi> of whom you ſpeak, replied
ſhe, anſwer the Calumny as ſhe pleaſe; but let me tell you, that unleſſe my minde alter
very much, I will never kiſs him that is aſleep; and as for the hornes of <hi>Pan,</hi> certainly if
ever I love any, I had rather he ſhould have them then I; yet, ſaid I unto her, the Moon,
whoſe name you have, does weare them very hanſomly. That is, anſwered ſhe, becauſe
ſhe is not married, and what ſhe does, is onely to advertiſe lovers whom ſhe lights in the
night, that the hornes which they are going to give another, ſhall at ſome time or other
be given unto them againe. But, ſaid ſhe, you prolong the time, get into your Cloſet;
ſo ſhe puſhed me in, and locked the door upon me: Then calling in the maids which
were in the next room waiting ſhe ſilently dreſſed her ſelfe, pretending that <hi>Daphnide</hi>
was not well: afterwards drawing the curtaines of the Windows, ſhe went to give ſuch
orders as were reſolved upon; in the meane time, although there was ſome in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
yet for all that, we talked together, without opening the doore; and though it was
in very low voice, yet one of the maids paſſing by the bed, did hear us, not what we ſaid,
but onely confuſed whiſpers. By fortune, <hi>Delia</hi> being careful of us, came back into the
Chamber at the ſame time: The maid then addreſſed unto her, and told, that ſhe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her ſiſter was ſicker, then ſhe imagined; why? ſaid <hi>Delia,</hi> becauſe, anſwered the maid,
ſhe talkes to her ſelfe, as if ſhe were diſtracted; what did ſhe ſay? replied <hi>Delia;</hi> I did
not heare the words diſtinctly, anſwered ſhe, but <hi>I</hi> am ſure ſhe talked. Alas, alas, ſaid
<hi>Delia,</hi> doe you not know it is her cuſtome every morning, as ſoon as ſhe wakes, to ſay her
prayers. The wench believed <hi>Delia,</hi> who a little after came to us, and told the ſtory, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing
us to ſpeak lower. I ſhall, ſaid I; but, faire <hi>Delia,</hi> is it not better to ſend them
all out, that the door may be opened. Ah, ah, ſaid ſhe, and laughed, I am now faire <hi>Delia,</hi>
and not long ſince nothing but homed <hi>Diana,</hi> who loved clubfooted <hi>Pan</hi> for a fleece of
wool; pray ſtay there where you are, until you have learned to ſpeak a little better of
<hi>Diana,</hi> otherwiſe ſhe will be angry, and puniſh both you, and us alſo. Upon this, ſhe went
to ſend out the maids and commanded one of them to bring up ſome meat for her ſiſter,
and to bring more then ordinary, becauſe ſhe did not ſup the laſt night. The maid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
preſently as ſhe was commanded; Then <hi>Delia</hi> ſhut the door: Now ſaid ſhe, the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53527:24"/>
Cavalier ſhall ſee how I will be revenged of him; then opening his door, Come Cavalier,
continued ſhe, before you receive the puniſhment which I intend you, I have brought you
ſome victuals, to ſtrengthen you a little, for I ſhould be very ſorry you ſhould die, before
you have felt my revenge. She ſpoke this with ſuch a pleaſant aire, as it was impoſſible
to forbear laughing: and after her ſiſter had taken a little broath, But <hi>Delia,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
where did you get this? will it not be perceived? yes, anſwered ſhe, if I had no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
then you. Come, come, no more queſtions, here it is, eat and be thankful, and
the reffuſe will ſerve a hungry Cavalier, whom I wiſh ſo ill unto. It is better, ſaid ſhe, to
let him have it all; for having faſted ſo long, I am ſure he has more need of it then <hi>I</hi> have.
Upon this, ſhe forced her ſiſter to take a little, and offered me ſome alſo, which <hi>I</hi> refuſed:
Nay, nay, take it, ſaid ſhe, it will down with the help of a willing mind. In ſuch talk as
this, we paſſed away all the morning, and dinner time being come, <hi>I</hi> muſt be ſhut up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
leaſt <hi>I</hi> ſhould be ſeen by thoſe who brought up meat: The worſt was, that din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was no ſooner done, but the Chamber was full of Gallants, whereof ſome perhaps
had the ſting of love upon them; and by fortune; the brother in law ſitting on the beds
ſide, he cauſed a Chair to be ſet for the principal of them, ſo near me, that <hi>I</hi> could ſcarce
breath but be heard. Conſider <hi>Adamas,</hi> in what a caſe <hi>I</hi> had been in, if <hi>I</hi> had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to cough or ſneeze. The moſt of their talke was of King <hi>Eurick,</hi> and the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which were making in divers places againſt him; of which <hi>I</hi> was very glad to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that <hi>I</hi> might acquaint the King therewith, which afterwards did him good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
But the worſt of all was, they ſtayed talking until night, though in the Chamber of
a ſick perſon, and never from about her bed: At laſt, having a mind to walk, they left
her all alone; and then the doores being ſhut, <hi>I</hi> came out of the Cloſet which <hi>Delia</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto me. Well, ſaid ſhe, How doe you like the adventure? pray what will you call
it? Shall the name of it be Perfect love, or Extream patience? It is, ſaid <hi>I</hi> unto her, the
moſt pleaſing adventure that ever <hi>I</hi> had. But, ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> what doe you think of your
being ſo long in that Cell? <hi>I</hi> think, Madam, anſwered <hi>I,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> am infinitely happy in
being near you. You may ſay what you pleaſe, replied <hi>Delia,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> am confident you
think liberty better then a cloſe priſon. If <hi>Diana</hi> knew what it was to love, anſwered <hi>I,</hi>
and what contentment it is to be neare the perſon loved; ſhe would not be ſo incredulous
as ſhe is, but on the contrary that <hi>I</hi> have found the Proverb to be falſe, which ſaith, No
Priſon ſweet; for <hi>I</hi> never found half the delight and contentment in the Palace of Great
<hi>Eurick,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> have done in this Priſon.</p>
                     <p>We continued in this diſcourſe a long while, and it was ſo ſweet unto me, that hours
ſeemed but minuts: and ſupper time being come, <hi>I</hi> muſt be againe ſhut up, but it was for
a ſhort time; for <hi>Daphnide</hi> being as <hi>I</hi> think, ſorry to leave me alone ſo long, ſhe made
ſuch haſte, that her ſiſter complained ſhe had not time enough to eat: yet ſhe had me in
memory; which done, <hi>I</hi> beſeeched the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> that ſince <hi>I</hi> was to depart ſo ſoone,
ſhe would be pleaſed to put off all viſits for that night, to the end that the time which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
might be imployed with her, which ſhe might wel do by feigning her ſelf not wel,
and by pretending that their being ſo long about her bed that afternoon, was the cauſe
of it. With much a doe, ſhe conſented, and <hi>Delia</hi> went preſently from her to bid all the
company good night, and to deſire excuſe, that ſhe went to take her reſt ſo ſoon.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>I</hi> was all alone with my faire Miſtreſs: For <hi>Delia,</hi> leſt any ſhould
ſurpriſe us, had locked the door, and carried the key with her. Love then, and this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
gave me a great alarm: for loving this fair Lady moſt paſſionately, and ſeeing
my ſelfe alone with her, it was enough to invite me unto the higheſt ſtrain of Courtſhip:
two other great Conſiderations preſented themſelves unto me: one was, the aſſurances
which ſhe gave me of her good will, which ought not to make me the more bold: The
other was, The precepts which I received from Great <hi>Eurick,</hi> not to let opportunity
ſlip; yet judge, Madam, how my affection was tempered: you know, Madam, that all
I did, was, I kneeled down at your beds ſide, and taking your hand, I kiſſed it with a
zealous kiſſe, and a ſigh: thus was my love accompanied with moſt humble and devout
reſpect.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, wiſe <hi>Adamas,</hi> that after I had been thus with her a long while, I ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her: I beſeech you, Madam, How do you command me to live? I would not have
you live, anſwered ſhe, as you have done for the time paſt; for if you ſhould, I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pardon you, after theſe teſtimonies of my good will which you have received from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53527:24"/>
me. This, Madam, ſaid I unto her, is a ſtrange command, and I vow that I will never obey it.
How <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſaid ſhe and ſtarted up out of her bed; Do you vow to diſobey me? Conſider
well what you ſay. By fortune <hi>Delia</hi> put the Key into the doore at the ſame time, and we
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rd her opening the door, upon which, fearing leſtſome ſhould come with her, I retired my
ſelf into the Cloſet without giving any anſwer; but when ſhe was come into the room, &amp;
I ſaw her alone, I came out, &amp; would have taken the hand of my fair Miſtris, but ſhe pulled it
away in an angry manner, ſaying unto me ſo loud that <hi>Delia</hi> heard; ſince you are in
that mind <hi>Alcidon,</hi> you would doe me a pleaſure, if you would trouble me no longer.
<hi>Delia</hi> hearing her give me this language, had an opinion that I had courted her ſiſter in
ſome way that was diſpleaſing unto her: This opinion moved her to ſmile and ſay; I
ſee that much may be done in a little time, ſince ſuch a change is hapned in this little
while I have been away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I dare lay a wager Cavalier, that you have not obſerved the
cuſtomes and conditions which I told you off when you firſt undertooke this adventure.
Nay, nay, anſwered her ſiſter, but perhaps he hath done much worſe; for had he done
as you ſay, he had been onely a perjured Lover, whereas by this which he hath done, he
hath declared himſelfe perfidious and a Traytor. Obſerve ſage <hi>Delia,</hi> ſaid I unto her,
two great injuries, and yet you ſee me indure them patiently, untill that you have heard
us both, and I will make you my Judge, hoping that you will appoint what ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhe ſhall make me.</p>
                     <p>The Cavalier, ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> is infinitely impudent; for he demands ſatisfaction,
where he deſerves puniſhment: but <hi>Delja</hi> ſince he hath made choice of you for his judge,
<hi>I</hi> will alſo chuſe you for mine, that you may appoint a puniſhment ſutable to his crime,
if you can find one equall unto it; and becauſe he ſhall not ſay, that I am too bitter in
my relation, <hi>I</hi> am contented you have it from his owne mouth. Then <hi>I</hi> began to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
very calmly, Obſerve <hi>I</hi> beſeech you oh my Judge, how my affection ſurmounts the
rigour of this Lady, ſhe requires that you ſhould cruelly puniſh me, and if <hi>I</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a fault, <hi>I</hi> make the ſame requeſt; but if ſhe have done (<hi>I</hi> will not ſay a fault, for <hi>I</hi>
do not think ſhe can) but if ſhe have done any injury againſt my love <hi>I</hi> do not require that
ſhe ſhould be puniſhed; for if ſhe ſmart, <hi>I</hi> ſhall die of the paine; all <hi>I</hi> deſire is, that ſhe
may not offend againſt that affection which <hi>I</hi> beare her. <hi>I</hi> deſire, anſwered <hi>Delia,</hi> that if
you will have me your Judge, <hi>I</hi> may heare your difference. Heare it <hi>I</hi> beſeech you ſaid
<hi>I</hi> unto her, from her owne mouth; for beſides that, <hi>I</hi> know ſhe can ſpeake nothing but
truth; it is reaſon you ſhould know it from her, ſince ſhe accuſeth me, and would have
me puniſhed. Tis true, ſaid <hi>Delia,</hi> it is your part to ſpeake firſt: <hi>I</hi> ſhall let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it in few words, replyed ſhe, for our diſcourſe was not long; he ſpake theſe words
unto me. How Madam, doe you command me to live? I anſwered him, I would not
have you live as you have done for the time paſt; for if you doe <hi>I</hi> ſhall never pardon you,
after I have given you ſuch teſtimonies of my good will. He anſwered; this is a moſt
ſtrange command, and I doe vow that I will never obey it, and when I charged him with
his diſobedience you entred, and hindred me from knowing what he would anſwer.
Then <hi>Delia</hi> turning towards me: Has <hi>Daphnide</hi> told the truth, ſaid ſhe? Yes my Judg, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
I, and upon theſe words, I require juſtice; as for the injury ſhe offered in calling
me perfidious and Traytor, I ſay nothing, becauſe you heard them, and beſides that, they
are but conſequents of the firſt offence. But ſaid <hi>Delia,</hi> which way hath ſhe offended you?
For Cavaler, anſwer unto theſe queſtions; doe you not proſeſſe your ſelfe a lover of this
Lady? Yes, anſwered I, ſo, that when I ceaſe to love, I ceaſe to live. Then replyed
<hi>Delia,</hi> do you not know, that it is one of the principalleſt laws of Love, for a Lover to obey
the perſon loved? Yes, anſwered I, and ſo, the commands be not contradictory to his affection; as
if ſhe ſhould command him not to love her, ſhe is not to be obeyed. Tis true, replyed <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide,</hi>
for every thing doth naturally fly that which would deſtroy it: but how can you
excuſe your ſelfe as not offending againſt this Precept, in this occaſion, where you have
not onely thought the command which ſhe made that you ſhould love her, to be ſtrange
and hard, but alſo has vowed to diſobey her. My Judge, anſwered I, I did proteſt it,
and I vow and proteſt it ſtill; and with this reſolution, that if I could die and die a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> many times as I have lived houres, ſince my firſt birth, I would rather chuſe all
thoſe deaths, then not vow and proteſt it. You hear (ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> being extreamly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry)
how he ſpeaks, and judge whether he does not deſerve puniſhment. My Judge, (ſaid
I and ſmiled) let my Miſtreſſe command me to fight againſt a whole Army of men; let
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53527:25"/>
her appoint me to caſt my ſelfe into the fire, nay, if ſhe pleaſe let her preſently put a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
through my heart, I will immediately obey her: And to let her ſee what dominion
ſhe has over me, let her put me to what teſt ſhe pleaſes; for I am ſure ſhe cannot command
me any thing, be it never ſo dangerous or full of difficulty, but my love will prompt me
immediately to obedience. Doe you not remember that when you firſt admitted me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
and enjoyned conditions upon me, how I promiſed to performe them all, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they did not contradict my love? I doe remember it, anſwered <hi>Delia:</hi> Then my
Judge, replyed I, methinkes you ſhould not take it ill, that I ſhould make this vow and
proteſtation of diſobedience unto my Miſtreſſe, for had I done otherwiſe I had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
and a Traytor, both to her and Love. I asked her how it was her pleaſure I
ſhould live; I would not have you live, anſwered ſhe, as you have done for the time
paſt. Now if I did love her for the time paſt as much as a heart could love, in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me not to love her as I did for the time paſt, is not this to command me not to
love her; and ſhould I not be diſloyall and perfidious if I ſhould obey ſuch a command?
No, no Madam I cannot doe it; I loved you when I was a Child; I have continued it
when I was a man, and ſhall love you till death; nothing can divert me from this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
it is ſo rivitted in my heart that it will never out as long as I live, nay, it will
be found in my heart after my death. <hi>Delia</hi> then began to ſmile, and ſaid, I ſee that Love
is a Child, and a little thing will ſet him a crying: my ſentence is this, I doe ordaine
firſt that all differences ſhall ceaſe; then, that <hi>Alcidon,</hi> as a puniſhment for his fault in
anſwering <hi>Daphnide</hi> ſo peremptorily, that he would diſobey her, that preſently he doe
kiſſe the hand of his Miſtreſſe; and that <hi>Daphnide</hi> as a puniſhment for commanding
him a thing which ſhe would not have done, had ſhe rightly underſtood it, that ſhe ſhall
kiſſe <hi>Alcidon,</hi> as a teſtimony of her repentance. This judgement was executed to my
great contentment, and we ſpent all the reſt of the night in ſuch pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
as when I heard a clocke ſtrike, me thought that it did not make quarters
of hours.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould never make an end, ſhould I relate all the diſcourſe we had amongſt us:
I will therefore onely tell you, that being ready to depart, after I had deferred it as long
as poſſibly I could; I took the hand of my faireſt Miſtreſſe and kneeling downe I ſaid thus
unto her; I am now Madam upon the laſt minute of my happineſſe; for <hi>Delia</hi> and the
time forceth me to depart; I perceive that neither of them are ſenſible of my paſſion, and
for ought I perceive, you, who are the cauſe of it, are as inſenſible as they. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
ſhe, doe not complaine of me; but conſider, that if I did not love you, I
ſhould never run the hazard of my honour, and your life, which is dearer to me then my
owne, and you thinke that the paſſion which blinds my eyes unto all theſe conſiderations
muſt needs be very great. Madam, ſaid I unto her, this is it which moſt amazeth me, that
ſince you have already done ſo much for me, you ſhould now doe ſo little. Then her
Siſter being at a little diſtance, doing ſomething in the Chamber, <hi>Daphnide</hi> anſwered
me. Remember Cavalier, that the conditions betwixt <hi>Delia</hi> and you, at your firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into this adventure were, that you ſhould not be too importunate in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
but to be patient and perſevere. At this word ſhe held her hand unto me, which
with a ſigh I devoutly kiſſed. Then, ſaid I unto her, all that I have to doe, is to pray
unto the great God <hi>Saturne,</hi> who is the Governour of time, that he will make it paſſe
away quickly, ſo as I may arrive at my happineſſe before my death: otherwiſe, that if
I muſt never arrive at it, then that my life may quickly paſſe, ſo as I may not live and
languiſh too long in paine. Live Cavalie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, ſaid ſhe unto me, and live contentedly,
and conſider that I doe love you. Theſe were the laſt words ſhe then ſpoke unto me; for
the clocke ſtrucke twelve, which was the hour of my departure, by appointment. And
<hi>Delia,</hi> leſt he who ſtayed for me at the doore ſhould be perceived, would not let me ſtay
any longer: Beſides, I was ſo extreamly grieved that the time was ſo expired as I could
not open my mouth to bid her adieu, at the leſt, I doe not remember what I ſaid.
Thus I parted ſo confuſedly melancholly, that I was in the midſt of the Garden before I
ſpoke or anſwered <hi>Delia</hi> one word, at which ſhe being halfe angry: What Cavalier,
ſaid ſhe unto me, and pulled me by the arme, have you leſt both your tongue and your
heart behind you? I doe not know faire <hi>Delia,</hi> ſaid I unto her what I have left, nor
what I have brought; but this adventure has given me the greateſt hopes, and the leaſt
effects that is imaginable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why? ungratefull Cavalier, ſaid <hi>Delia,</hi> could you ever
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53527:25"/>
imagine to obtaine more then you have from my ſiſter? Much leſſe in regard of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ſaid I unto her, but much more in regard of my affection: If you had a ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſaid ſhe unto me, I believe you would have thought quite contrary; for you might
expect to obtain much, ſince you are <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſo much eſteemed by all that know you;
ſo as your merits might juſtly plead highly in your behalfe; but your love cannot yet
pretend unto much, being ſo young, as I cannot tell whether your affection can be called
by the name of Love; for the name of man, muſt not be attributed unto one which is
but newly crawled out of his Cradle. How ſaire ſiſter of my faireſt Miſtreſſe, ſaid I unto
her; doe you call my love young, when it took root in me as ſoon as I had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good or evill? and can you call it little, which in grandure ſurpaſſeth the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Gyant that ever breathed upon earth? I think it young (ſaid ſhe) becauſe it never
took beginning, till the day before you began this adventure: and I eſteem it little, in
compariſon of what it will be, and in reaſon ought to be. But, ſaid ſhe, and ſhaked me
by the hand, let us leave off this diſcourſe, and tell me when you think to ſee us againe,
and what you have reſolved upon with my ſiſter? You heard all our diſcourſe, anſwered
I, and I am ſo much grieved to part from her, that I doe not remember any thing. Since
ſo, ſaid ſhe, and ſmiled, your Miſtreſs did very well to favour you no more, for your grief
would have made you forget all: Doe not think ſo, replyed I; for as I have not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that I did not receive thoſe favours which I hoped for, ſo ſhould I never forget, if I had
received thoſe favours which I deſire.</p>
                     <p>Doe not imagine ſo, anſwered ſhe, for men doe much longer remember injuries then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits;
and bitterneſſe has a longer reliſh in their mouthes then ſweetneſſe; but ſince you
have not reſolved upon any thing with my ſiſter, let me adviſe you to ſee her againe, as
ſoon and as often as you can: for you muſt conſider, that nothing but eyes will ſatisfie
love, nothing will make it take root ſooner then ſeeing her; and nothing will make it
grow better then often talking with her. I deſire <hi>Alcidon,</hi> to teſtifie, that I doe love you;
and ſince you have undertaken this adventure, and ſince it was I who opened the door un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, I will give you ſuch advice, as queſtionleſſe, if you doe follow it, you will bring
your enterpriſe to paſſe; I am a little elder then my ſiſter, and conſequently have a little
more experience then ſhe, and perhaps then you either; therefore doe not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
which I ſhall give you, unleſſe you meane to repent it. My ſiſter loves you, ſhe
has told me as much, and you may believe it, by her thus hazarding her honour for a
ſight of you: but ſhe is very young, and by conſequence naturally ſubject unto the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilities
of youth. Youth is apt to take any kind of impreſſion, and as apt to loſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again;
their moiſt memories are like ſoft wax, you may imprint what you will, and it
will as eaſily loſe the impreſſions, if any new print be offered: therefore to avoid this
danger, and if you will ſtill be loved, and well loved, you muſt by your preſence often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
theſe firſt impreſſions, if you cannot doe it as much as is requiſite by preſence, let it
be by Letters, and meſſages: for when ſuch unhop't for, and unexpected Complements
doe come, they work very great effects: for in love, thoſe contentments which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
ſeem to be due, and it is an injury if they be retarded or refuſed; whereas others
that come unlook't for, work great effect upon that ſoul which receives them. Fair <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
ſaid I unto her, If I could requite theſe favours which I receive from you, with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of my life, I ſhould think my ſelfe much beholding unto fortune: But not daring to
hope for ſo much happineſſe, I beſeech you believe, that in teſtimony of the eſteem which
I have of your judgement and good advice, I will moſt religiouſly obſerve it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
my obligations unto you in my memory as long as I live; and in requital, though I
have not a heart of mine own to preſent unto you, I will engage my ſelfe to ſend you one,
which you will eſteem much above that which was mine, and is now <hi>Daphnides. Alcidon</hi>
(ſaid ſhe, and ſmiled) I perceive by your diſcourſe, that every thing turnes to its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
for when you came firſt into the Garden, you talked thus of loſing your heart, and
doe the ſame at your going out: I wiſh that ſhe who has it, may long injoy it: and in
the meane time, I ſhall ſee what effects your promiſes will produce, as well in obſerving
my advice, as in ſending me this heart which you have promiſed.</p>
                     <p>Being now come to the Garden door, I took my leave of her; and having found my
guide, we walked a gentle pace towards our rocks, but as if the heavens frowned at our
ſeparation: they were upon a ſuddain overſpread with Clouds, ſo as we did not onely loſe
the light of the Moon, but were ſo wet with Rain, as we were forced to ſhelter our ſelves
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53527:26"/>
under a thick tree, until the fury of it was over. My guide had ſo loſt his aime of the way,
as when we went unto thoſe who ſtayed for us, he wandered, and led me unto the head
of that Fountaine, which gives both the name and beginning unto the River of <hi>Sorgues.</hi>
This Fountaine is ſo beſet with great Rocks, that it ſeemes as if it were incloſed with
high walles every way, but that by which we came. When this Spring is calm, it ſeems
to be a great well, whoſe water being too full, runs over: But ſometimes, as my guide
told me, it is moſt horrid to behold: For, ſaid he, do you ſee that high Rock upon your
left hand, I aſſure you, that it will often belch out his water as high as it, with ſuch a
fury and noiſe, that no Tempeſt at Sea does equal it. Doe they not know the cauſe
ſaid I unto him? No, anſwered he; for ſometimes it begins to be in this fury, when the
weather is very faire, and as now you ſee, when it raines, it will be as calme as other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The cauſe, replyed I, muſt needs be from wind incloſed, which forceth the waters
thus.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt we were talking thus, the Rain ſtill continued, and I, having found a hollow
Rock, under which I could ſhelter my ſelfe, I adviſed the Guide to go unto them who
ſtayed for me, in the mean time I would reſt my ſelf, and when the raine was paſt, the
Moon would ſhine, and help us in the way.</p>
                     <p>Now, Reverend Father, I ſhall here relate unto you a moſt ſtrange adventure, not as
pertinent to our diſcourſe, but for the ſtrangeneſſe of it. When my Guide was gone, as
I commanded him, and I alone under this wild Rock, Love, out of pitty would not let
me be long without him, for I fell into the ſweet thoughts of <hi>Daphnide;</hi> and after I had
pleaſed my ſelfe a while in thoſe raptures, me thought the weather cleared up, and the
Moon breaking through the thick Clouds, ſhined as bright as ever I ſaw it: This invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me out of my hollow Rock, and whilſt I was looking about me that way which I
ſuppoſed my company would come, I heard the Fountaine make a noiſe. I went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to the ſide of it, thinking it would riſe up, according to reports: and having a
deſire to ſee this wonder, I ſet my ſelfe down upon a ſtone near unto this Fountaine; then
did I ſee a thing which indeed is beyond beliefe, without a ſight: I ſaw the water riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
its bank, up to the height of four feet, and then it appeared to be like an old man
from the middle upward, with long haire dangling about his ſhoulders, and a beard
hanging down to his breaſt, which being wet as well as his hair of his head, ſeemed to be
ſo many ſeveral ſtreams about him, with another that flowed out of a pot which he held
under his left arm. This old man was Crowned with Rock-fern, and Ruſhes, and for a
Scepter, held a great Reed in his right hand. Whilſt I ſtood wondring at this Viſion,
I ſaw the water to divide it ſelfe into ſeveral ſtreames, and as ſoon as he touched them,
I ſaw ſo many Naiades, or water-Nymphs about him, as there was ſtreames in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
All out of reverence, bowed unto him, and he raiſing himſelfe above them, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Throne which the water made for him, they came to kiſſe his hand, and to preſent
him with ſome Gifts: one preſented unto him a Chaire, made and covered with Moſs;
another, a Garland of Ruſhes and Ivie; another, a Girdle of Fern; another, a basket of
Cheſnuts; one offered Poites of water flowers; another, a Net full of ſeverall Fiſhes:
To be brief, every one gave him ſomething, as teſtimonies of their good will, which he
received with many thanks. After this, with a loud ſhril voyce, he ſaid, Oh Divine Nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,
whom the Deſtinies have ordained to live in waters, and who complain that you
are confined unto my little Spring, whereas your ſiſters ſwim with full ſpred armes in the
<hi>Roſne,</hi> and <hi>Durance.</hi> Ceaſe your complaints, and with me rejoyce at the advantageous
choice which they have made for you. For though the limits of our Dominion is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
unto others in largeneſſe: yet we doe excell them in ſo many priviledges, that we
have no reaſon to envy any of our Neighbours: For our life is ſweet and quiet, none
comes to break our ſleep, nor interrupt our paſtimes; our banks are never ſmeered with
Homicides, nor are our waters ruffled with the ſwelling weight of ſayling Ships. But
that which ought moſt to content us, nay which makes us glorious, above all the Rivers
of <hi>Europe,</hi> is, my divine ſiſters, the infallible promiſe which we have from Deſtiny, and
which was confirmed with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>Happy <hi>Daemon</hi> of <hi>Sorgues,</hi> Hearken (ſaid he unto me) to the promiſe which I make
unto thee, Nine and twenty ages ſhall be no ſooner paſt, but upon thy bankes ſhall come
the <hi>Florentine</hi> Swan, which ſhall ſing ſo ſweetly under the ſhade of a Laurel tree, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing
thereby both Gods and Men, he ſhall for ever make thy Name famous through all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53527:26"/>
the world, and ſhall make thee excell in honour, all the Rivers which like thy ſelfe doe
empty themſelves into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>He would have continued on, when hearing ſome noiſe, and as I beleeve, eſpying
my Companions as they were coming to me, I was aſtoniſhed that he and his troope
daſhing the water with their hands, they made it riſe ſo high that I loſt my ſight, and
I lay as if I were aſleepe, as thoſe who came unto me told me, not ſo neere the Fountain
as I thought my ſelfe, but in the ſame place where the Guide left me when he went
unto them.</p>
                     <p>This ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> was a moſt miraculous viſion, which truly for my part I beleeve
to be a dream, but not an ordinary one; for doubtleſſe this doth ſignifie that ſome great
and remarkable perſon ſhall inhabit in thoſe ſolitary Rockes, and make thoſe bankes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
by the renowne he ſhall get; which is to be ſuppoſed will be very great, ſince the
promiſe of it is made by the Deſtinies, with ſuch advantagious words. I cannot tell,
ſaid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> whether it was a Dreame or no; but I am ſure, that I thought my ſelfe to
be awake: and afterwards he continued thus:</p>
                     <p>I tooke Horſe, and to omit all the particulars of my returne, after many dangers,
I arrived at the place where I left King <hi>Eurick,</hi> who received me with many a Carraſſe;
and as it pleaſed him to honour me ſo farre as to love me ſo would he often aske me how
I did thrive in my love; ſo now taking me by my hand, he carried me into a private
roome where none could heare. Come, Lov's Souldier, ſaid he unto me, Does all goe
well in your enterpriſe, and have you had a good journey or no? Sir, ſaid I, when it
ſhall pleaſe you, I ſhall give a true relation of it, and then your ſelfe may judge. Let it
be now, ſaid he unto me, for I much long to know whether you are as proſperous in
Love, as I have been in Warre: Then in obedience to his command, I related the whole
Adventure; but I have ſince heartily repented that I ſpoke ſo advantagiouſly of <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
beauty and ſpirit; for I perceived that it pleaſed him exceedingly to heare that all
I obtained was good words, and a few kiſſes: then would I have applyed a remedy to
my errour, but it was too late: yet to turne the matter, I began to extoll <hi>Delia,</hi> and
ſo, that at firſt I did beleeve I ſhould imbarque him there. The King, who was more
ſubtill then to beleeve it, to put me out of my ſuſpition, did ſet ſo good a face upon the
matter, that perhaps any other might have beene deceived as well as I. Oh what groſſe
folly it is for any Lover to acquaint his Maſter with his affection! For it did kindle in
him ſuch thoughts as were not in him before, and put him into hopes of being, if not
a Poſſeſſor of my happineſſe, yet at leſt a pretender unto it; yet God knowes what force
ambition has upon the ſpirit of a woman, eſpecially upon a woman of a generous ſoule.
Whilſt we were thus diſcourſing upon the buſineſſe, newes was brought the King, that
they of <hi>Arles</hi> were reſolved to ſubmit themſelves into his hands, upon thoſe conditions he
offered unto them; to wit, the conſervation of their Franchiſes and priviledges, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the Inhabitans of the Town were ſo couragious, as they would never have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to acknowledge him. This is the reaſon, ſaid the King, and tooke me aſide, why
I aske you whether you are as proſperous in Love, as I am in Warre: For this City is
the chiefe of all the Province, and it rendring it ſelfe unto me, it is to be thought that
all the reſt after its example, will doe the like. Sir, ſaid I unto him, it is a very happy
Omen unto me, and if I doe bring about my deſigne, I will not change my prize for
yours. The King imbraced me with a ſmile, and ſaid afterward aloud, we ſhall heare
the reſt of your buſineſſe another time; Meane while, I will goe and take orders to
content thoſe of this Towne ſo, as may invite others to doe as they have done; that
Sir, ſaid I unto him is the beſt courſe you can take; for a great King, as you are, ſhould
force people unto ſubmiſſion, more by ſweetneſſe, then violence.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the King was buſie on his ſide, I was no leſſe on mine; for at the ſame time
I diſpatched <hi>Alvian,</hi> which was the name of him whom <hi>Daphnide</hi> gave me for a guide;
and becauſe ſhe had a great truſt and confidence in him, and that his fidelity and affection
was already known unto me, I deſired him to contrive it ſo, that by his prudence I might
ſometimes ſee that fair Lady; I told him that I would never forget my obligations unto
him, which I would repay any way he would deſire: ſo he departed with a promiſe,
that he would ſtudy my contentment, and upon every occaſion would teſtifie his deſire
of doing me ſervice. Thus I left him, and was in ſuch raptures of Love, as I had no
other thought but of <hi>Daphnide;</hi> I found by experience, that Lovers doe not meaſure
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53527:27"/>
their time, like other men, but according to the impatiency of the paſſion which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth
them; for dayes ſeemed unto me whole months, ſo long did I thinke them, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
no newes from this faire Lady; my ſweeteſt entertainment was my owne thoughts,
which when I could get my ſelfe out of all company, ran continually upon the paſſages
of my voyage.</p>
                     <p>The great <hi>Eurick,</hi> having nothing to doe after the rendition of this Towne, would
refreſh his Army for ſome dayes; for it had been much tyred out in that occaſion, and
dividing them into ſeverall Quarters, he kept no more about him, then were requiſite
for the ſafety of his perſon. And becauſe it was his cuſtome when he tooke Truce with
<hi>Mars,</hi> to begin warre with <hi>Venus,</hi> and with his ſport in hunting, he devoted himſelfe
unto them two, there being nothing more odious unto his courage, then idleneſſe; and
it was his ordinary Apothegme, that to live and do nothing, was to bury himſelfe before
he was dead.</p>
                     <p>My office called me to be continually about his perſon, but my affection to him
much more; and therefore I was never from his elbow. The truth is, this new love, or
rather this renewing of my old love to <hi>Daphnide,</hi> had made me ſo melancholly that I
could hardly ſpeake unto any: Which the King perceiving one day when he was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
whether it was to mocke at my paſſion, or whether it pleaſed him to heare talke
of her, who tyed my heart and my tongue, I know not; but he called me unto him,
and with a ſmile, ſaid; May one not interrupt your thoughts ſo farre <hi>Alcidon,</hi> as to
tell you, that they are ſo much taken up with abſent perſons, that they care not for us
that are preſent. Sir, ſaid I unto him, there is a neceſſity of it upon me, which I hope
wil ſerve for an excuſe. For ought I ſee <hi>Alcidon,</hi> replyed he, none but I am a loſer in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
Why Sir, ſaid I unto him? Becauſe, ſaid he, <hi>Daphnide</hi> hath gotten a Servant,
and you, in lieu of a Maſter, have gotten both a Maſter and a Miſtreſſe: But I have loſt;
for whereas, I alone did poſſeſſe you, now I have a Companion who has a ſhare with
me, and perhaps a greater then I have. Did I thinke Sir, replyed I pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſently, that my
affection would any manner of way divert me from that ſervice which I owe unto you;
doubtleſſe Sir, in lieu of Love, I would chuſe Death, and ſhould thinke my ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to live, if I did not to my laſt breath continue in this deſigue. But then, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prejudice to your ſervice I may obtaine that happineſſe which Love doth promiſe me,
and which my heart does ſo paſſionately deſire, I cannot thinke it any loſſe to you; for a
good Maſter, as you are does alwayes deſire to ſee his Servants thrive in contentment. I
muſt confeſſe, ſaid he unto me, and laughed, that this affection, ſo it do you no harm,
it will not doe me any; but I much feare, that as diſeaſe cannot continue long, but it
muſt needs either increaſe or diminiſh; ſo if yours do not quickly diminiſh, it will ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
that we ſhall be both loſers: And therefore you muſt either be diverted from it,
or elſe uſe ſome remedies. Sir, ſaid I unto him, the care which you are pleaſed to have
of me, will guard me from all danger: But to cure or diminiſh my affection, is to attempt
a thing which is beyond the reach of all poſſibility.</p>
                     <p>This, ſaid the King, is a moſt ſtrong and violent paſſion, Sir, ſaid I unto him, did
you but ſee her who is the cauſe of it, you would ſay, all is too little to equall her:
But is it credible, ſaid he, that ſhe ſhould be ſo fair, as you ſpeake her? Sir, anſwered I,
did I not feare that I my ſelfe ſhould be the cauſe of my owne ruine, I would tell you (and
truly) much more; but I am afraid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in ſo doing I ſhould ſharpen the weapon which
will kill me. How doe you meane? ſaid he unto me, and becauſe I did not anſwer:
Speak freely <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſaid he, tell me what your fear is; and he commanding me two or
three times, at laſt I continued; I feare Sir, and not without reaſon, leſt <hi>Daphnide</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo infinitely faire, ſhould have as great an influence upon your ſoule, as ſhe hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mine; if that ſhould happen, there is no way for me but death, and a death ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
that my moſt mortall enemies would pitty me.</p>
                     <p>I knew by ſeverall circumſtances, ſaid he then unto me, that you were in this doubt,
and I had a mind to put you out of it: No, no, I would not offer ſuch wrong unto any
of my ſervants, much leſſe unto you, upon whom I have conferred ſo many ſignall teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of my particular good will: live happily, and never fear it, for I ſwear by my
Crowne, that no humane beauty upon Earth can make me commit ſuch a fault. Sir, ſaid
I unto him, I muſt humbly proſtrate my ſelfe at your feet, by way of gratitude: for I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
this favour no leſſe than a new life, and am ſure that if ſuch a misfortune had beene,
I had been but a dead man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:53527:27"/>
Our diſcourſe had not ſo ſoon ended, unleſſe the Chaſe coming towards us, had not
forced us away; as for me, I was the moſt contented man alive, putting full aſſurance in
his words, and therefore ever ſince, when he ſpake unto me, I told him freely all paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
concerning my paſſion. Some dayes thus paſſed on, and I heard no newes from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian,</hi>
which was no ſmall trouble unto me: But at the ſame time, the Kings affaires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
him to receive ſome place which would ſubmit into his hands; and therefore he
drew out part of his Army towards that quarter where <hi>Daphnide</hi> dwelt. When the King
told me his reſolution, I was raviſhed with joy, and ſaid unto him; Now ſir, I hope you
will grace me ſo farre, as to ſee my Miſtreſſe, for we ſhall paſſe cloſe by her houſe; with
all my heart, anſwered he: then we ſhall ſee whether ſhe be ſo faire as you ſame her
to be; and if I talke with her, <hi>I</hi> ſhall quickly know whether you will ſpeed in your
hopes.</p>
                     <p>The King ſets forward, and to omit all matters which are not pertinent to my ſtory,
though in themſelves worthy of Chronicle; and being within a mile of <hi>Daphnides</hi> houſe,
he told me that he would ſee her, and that in rrſpect of the good ſervice which her Father
had done him, he could doe no leſſe being ſo near her and her Mother, but ſee them. I am
ſtill afraid Sir, ſaid I unto him, that this honour which you intend to doe them, is mixed
with Love. What? ſaid he, and ſmiled, you old fits of folly againe? will you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what I have promiſed with an oath; had I onely promiſed, I ſhould be onely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
in ſo doing, but having ſworn, I ſhould be perfidious: Come, come, caſt away
theſe fooliſh thoughts, unleſſe you are reſolved to offend me; and on the contrary, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that I will do all the good offices I can, and as you can expect from the beſt of your
freinds.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, I preſently diſpatched a meſſenger unto <hi>Daphnide,</hi> to let her know of the
Kings coming; and when we were in ſight of the houſe, I would have gone before, but
he commanded me to ſtay with him, becauſe (ſaid he to me, and ſmiled) I ſhall be more
welcome if I bring you with me, than if I come by my ſelfe. Sir, ſaid I unto him, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Lady has ſo much judgement, as rightly to value the honour which you doe
her; but Sir, take heed leſt you loſe the title of invincible; for I aſſure you, there are
ſtrange Captivaters in that houſe; it is the habitation of the Graces; <hi>Daphnide</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with two ſiſters, who yield not unto any but her ſelfe; and had I not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
engaged, there is one <hi>Delia</hi> who doubtleſſe had abſolutely captivated me. Is that
ſhe, ſaid the King, of whom you ſpoke to me before? Yes ſir, anſwerd I, and doubtleſſe
the moſt accompliſhed beauty that ever I ſaw, if as I told you before, ſhe had not a ſiſter.
To her then, ſaid the King, will I addreſſe my ſelfe. By this time we were come ſo neare
the Caſtle, that the Ladies being upon the bridge, the King lighted from his horſe to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
them; and taking the Mother by the hand, he went into the great Chamber, where
they talked a while; and the King enquired of her and her husbands health, and whether
Wars were not offenſive to her. In the meane time, I talked to the fair <hi>Daphnide,</hi> who
though at all times fair, yet, that day, it might be ſaid, ſhe ſurpaſſed her ſelfe, having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto her natural beauty, ſo many Graces by her artificial dreſs, as I never ſaw any
ſo fit to conquer hearts. <hi>Delia</hi> ſtood next to her, and my eyes and heart being fixed in
contemplation of their beloved object, I ſtood gazing a long time before I ſpoke. You
went away, ſaid <hi>Delia,</hi> without a heart, and return without a tongue; if you loſe as much
every voyage, you will become very ill company: <hi>Delia,</hi> ſaid I unto her, you are very
pleaſant; but if ſhe who hinders you from being the faireſt in the world, doe uſe ſuch
Arts, I know not what will become of me. Who doe you ſpeak of? ſaid <hi>Daphnide;</hi> of you
Madam, anſwered I, who adds ſo much art unto your Naturall beauty, that no eye can
look, and hope to eſcape impriſonment. I ſhould in favour of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> anſwered ſhe,
believe that this might be, if every one did look upon me with <hi>Alcidons</hi> eyes. But let us
leave this diſcourſe, and tell us which way do you take. I am ſure, ſaid I unto her, that
the way hither, is the way of my felicity, and my way from you, is the way of my hell:
Nay, nay, ſaid <hi>Daphnide;</hi> I mean, which way does the King go, and whither does your
Army intend to march? I would have anſwered her, but the King called me away. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon,</hi>
ſaid he unto me, come hither, and be a witneſſe; is not the ſtrong Towne of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
reduced into our hands? Yes certainly, ſir, ſaid I unto him; and you muſt look for
other Kingdomes, and indeed other Worlds, to exerciſe your Armes in, for there is no
more to Conquer which I know of. They will not believe me, replyed the King; and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53527:28"/>
therefore I pray relate unto this incredulous Lady, how not onely <hi>Arles,</hi> but almoſt all
the Province which is called the <hi>Romans,</hi> is in our hands. Oh, ſir, ſaid the good old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
not but that <hi>I</hi> did believe what you did ſay; but it is becauſe till now, we thought
the Towne of <hi>Arles</hi> impregnable. Nay, nay, replyed the King, <hi>I</hi> will have you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the whole ſeries of the ſtory, to the end that hereafter you may not doubt of what
<hi>I</hi> ſay: Upon this, riſing up, he ſet me in his place, and went to the place from whence <hi>I</hi>
came; and becauſe <hi>Delia</hi> when he came, would have retired, he pulled her back, and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
awhile unto them both. <hi>I</hi> could not poſſibly heare what they ſaid, as well becauſe it
was but a little too far off, as becauſe <hi>I</hi> was engaged to talke unto this old Lady. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after, when the King took <hi>Daphnide</hi> by the hand, and carried her the Window, <hi>I</hi>
muſt confeſſe, then <hi>I</hi> began to doubt, and my words did ſo die in my mouth, as if <hi>I</hi> were
ſoul-leſſe: I could not chuſe but obſerve their faces and actions; and whatſoever I ſaw, made
me ſuſpect that which I feared moſt; ſo as I wiſhed withall my heart, for ſome hot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm
to call away the King from the place where he was. I cannot tell how long his
Courtſhip laſted, but I am ſure it laſted ſo long, that I thought every minute a day. At
the laſt, the King took his leave, and went on his journey. <hi>Daphnide</hi> ſeeing me fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
did beckon unto me, as deſirous to ſpeak with me; whereupon I commanded one
of my men to hide my horſe, to the end I might have ſome colour to ſtay behind; ſo as
though the King called me twice or thrice, yet ſtay I did, ſeeming to be very angry with
my ſervants, for the little care they had of my Horſe. The King, and almoſt all the Train
departed; and I going into the houſe, ſeeming onely becauſe I would not have the Ladies
ſtay ſo long in the Sun, I took <hi>Daphnide</hi> aſide: Well Madam, ſaid I unto her, what doe
you thinke of the Great <hi>Eurick?</hi> Nay, ſaid ſhe, what diſcourſe doe you thinke we had?
I cannot tell, replyed I: Then, ſaid ſhe, I will tell you, and you ſhall judge which of us
two loves you beſt: when he took me to the window, to the end <hi>Della</hi> might not hear,
though at the firſt he ſtayed her with me out of civility: he ſaid unto me; I doe not now
wonder, that <hi>Alcidon</hi> ſhould run ſuch hazard to ſee you, for I proteſt you are the faireſt
in the world; and now I have ſeen you, I cannot think any in the whole Univerſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of eſteem.</p>
                     <p>At the firſt, this diſcourſe made me bluſh, eſpecially hearing him mention you, and of
a buſineſſe which I did not thinke he knew of: yet ſeeming as if I did not underſtand
him, <hi>I</hi> anſwered thus: <hi>I</hi> know not ſir, why you ſhould tell me of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> nor what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
he has run; but I am ſure, that there is nothing in me worthy of your eye, nor of
the language of ſo great a King. Why, fair one, ſaid he unto me, did you thinke <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon</hi>
could leave our Army without my leave, and without telling me whither he went?
The Law of War is very ſevere and ſtrickt: moreover, aſſure your ſelfe, that he is too
young to enjoy ſo much good fortune. I am ſo little verſed in the way of War, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, and the age of <hi>Alcidon</hi> does ſo little concerne me, as I never learned the one, nor
cared for the other. Why, ſaid he, doe you thinke I know not, how he hath ſeene you
twice; the firſt time at a Cavaliers houſe, who has the charge of my Artilery; and the
next time, at your ſiſters, where you kept him in a Cloſet: No, no, Fair one, he has told
me all, and ſo particularly, as you your ſelf do not know them better: Certainly, ſaid I, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon</hi>
has a great confidence in you; and in ſaying ſo, I was conſtrained to cover my
bluſhes with my hand, being aſhamed the King ſhould know all theſe particulars. But
he ſmiling; This, ſaid he, is the common vanity of all young people; they cannot be
ſilent, but muſt be blabbing of their own happineſſe; but be not angry I ſhould know
this, ſince loving and honouring you ſo much as I do, I ſhall take no notice of it; but
if you will follow my advice, and preſerve your reputation, caſt off this youth, and reject
his addreſſes; for you may be certaine, that he who would tell me theſe things, will in
an humour tell them to any other, and perhaps to ſome that are not ſo diſcreet as I
am.</p>
                     <p>Judge, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, into what a condition you have brought me, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
him with theſe things, which above all you ſhould have concealed. How can I
chuſe but be extreamly angry with you, when I reflect upon the wrong you have done
me? Madam, ſaid I unto her, I muſt needs confeſſe my ſelfe in a great fault, but I am
confident you will excuſe it, if you will but pleaſe to remember the manner how we lived
in the dayes of his Predeceſſor King <hi>Thoriſmond,</hi> who being the firſt cauſe of our love;
I thought this King, being as gracious unto me as the other, would alſo favour the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53527:28"/>
of it: but I perceive their deſignes are farre different; for the one aimed at
my happineſſe in giving me that which he had a mind unto himſelfe: and the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to make me moſt miſerable by raviſhing from me, her whom he knowes is mine,
and without whom he knowes I value not my life: For I doe foreſee, by the knowledge
which I have of his humour, that he will love you; his deſigne I perceive is to put you
out of conceit with me; ſo as your mind then not being ingaged, he hopes the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
to win upon you, and bring about his own ends. But Madam, if you doe think him
able to compaſſe his deſires, and that I ſhall ever ſee this change in you, I conjure you
by the memory of great <hi>Thoriſmond,</hi> who loved us both ſo well, never to let me ſee it,
but to tell me betimes, that my death may anticipate ſuch a dire accident. <hi>Daphnide</hi>
then ſmiled, and ſaid, I am very glad to ſee you ſo much perplexed as you are, as well to
prevent you from relapſing into your crime of being ſo liberall in your tongue, as to
know by your fears which you have of the King and of his good will unto me, that you
doe really love me. But <hi>Alcidon,</hi> I love you too well to let you be long in this perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
Live therefore contentedly, and be confident, that as long as <hi>Alcidon</hi> loves me, <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
will never love any other, and that neither the grandure, nor authority of a King
ſhall ever be able to alter me in this reſolution.</p>
                     <p>We had talked longer, if the King who had already ſent twice for me, had not ſent
the third time, fearing, as I beleeve, leſt <hi>Daphnide</hi> ſhould impart unto me, what he had
ſaid unto her: Therefore after I had kiſſed the hand of my faireſt Miſtreſſe, and after ſhe
had given me aſſurance, that if the King continued, ſhe would impart all unto me, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and galloped after the King, whom I found gone but a little way; for he ſtayed
purpoſely to diſpatch away an expreſſe to colour thereby his ſtaying for me, and to the end,
that if I came not quickly, he might ſend another meſſenger for me. When I was come
unto him; <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſaid he, I ſent for you, becauſe there is danger in coming after an
army with few men; for I have intelligence that the Enemy is not farre off, and if they
have any deſigne of doing any thing, they will watch ſuch occaſions by their ſpies. I gave
him moſt humble thankes for the care he had of me, and though I made no ſhew of it,
yet I knew very well, that when he ſaid the enemy was not farre off, he ſaid truly, ſince
he himſelfe was neer me, and no enemy could be more dangerous nor cruell then himſelfe.
Obſerve, wiſe <hi>Adamas,</hi> the follies of love; I reſented the injury ſo deepely, that had I
not feared to incur the danger of being taxed for a perfidious Cavalier, I know not unto
what fury my reſentments might have prompted me unto againſt him; but upon good
conſideration of the matter, I reſolved to ſmother my wrongs, and ſeeme to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that I knew any thing; conſidering, that when the deſires of people are thwarted,
they are moſt violent, and when the deſires of perſons in power are once knowne, they are
prompted to uſe violence. But the great conſtraint in which I lived, did ſo perplex me
that I fell ſicke: By this, reverend Father, you may judge how great my affection was,
ſince it had power to bring me into ſuch a condition. The King did not thinke my ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſo great as it was; but it increaſing every day, and his affaires conſtraining him not
to abide long in one place, he left me in the City of <hi>Avignion,</hi> upon the report of the
Phyſitians, who told him how great my diſeaſe was.</p>
                     <p>Thus I tarried in this Towne ſo ill, that but for the contentment which I received
from ſome Letters which <hi>Daphnide</hi> ſent me by <hi>Alvian,</hi> I know not what would have
become of me. However, it was more then eight dayes that I kept my bed, before I
heard any newes from <hi>Daphnide,</hi> becauſe ſhe not knowing of my ſickneſſe, but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
me to be in the Army, ſhe ſent <hi>Alvian</hi> thither. In the meane time I who thought
that ſhe knew of my ſickneſſe, I pined away with ſorrow and griefe, having an opinion
that her ſilence proceeded from a defect in her affection, and then I blamed the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and ambition of women, ſuppoſing that the Kings affection to her was certainly the
cauſe of it. At laſt, my impatiency not being able to indure this incertainty: I ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her my Servant, who carried my Letters; the firſt time unto her, and in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of my ſickneſſe, I writ theſe few words unto her.</p>

writ ſo ſhort, was becauſe ſhe thought me ſo ſicke, as I was not able to read more. Oh,
ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> I cannot expreſſe my joyes! I was indeed very ſicke, and the Phyſitians,
who applyed onely corporall remedies, were farre beſides the marke, ſince my malady
was only of the mind. The truth is, that from the firſt houre of <hi>Alvians</hi> arrival, I reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

and I knew that if the minde of this faire one proved ſtrong enough to reſiſt him, he

at laſt, love having the predominancy in my heart, I reſolved to adviſe her, not
to receive any ſuch meſſages from him, if it were poſſible: yet my curioſity prompted me

read them, and I ſhould never know; ſo I returned her this Anſwer.</p>

                     <p>I ſhould be too tedious, ſhould I relate all the Letters which we writ unto each other at
that time; for ſince it was not above ſix or ſeven leagues betwixt us, we ſent unto each
other almoſt every day: But ſo it was, that the King being reſolved to be as victorious in
Love, as in War; he perſiſted ſo cloſe in the Courtſhip of this faire one, as what excuſe
ſoever ſhe can find, ſhe muſt confeſſe, that if it was not Love, yet it was Ambition at
the leaſt, which invited her to hearken unto him, and to entertaine his Courtſhip: Oh
Heavens? what groſſe folly it is in any, to look for any certainty under the Moon? I mean
for any thing which is not alterable? Whilſt thus we continued writing unto each other,
the King continued his enterpriſe; and I who thought that I had a good occaſion to
laugh at him, did find my ſelfe in the concluſion, the party laughed at. Pardon me, Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Miſtreſs, I beſeech you, if this truth offend you. Well, well, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi>
and interrupted him, I will not now anſwer you, go on with your diſcourſe as you
pleaſe. Upon this, <hi>Alcidon</hi> continued.</p>
                     <p>The King having effected his enterpriſe againſt his enemies, he returned the ſame way
he came, purpoſely to ſee his new Miſtreſſe: and to the end I ſhould know nothing of it,
he came the night before his Army, almoſt all alone, and lodged in her houſe. He had
made choice of ſuch to wait upon him, as I knew nothing of it a long time after; but at
laſt, I came to know it by an accident, which hereafter I ſhall tell you. In the meanetime,
the King came to <hi>Avignion,</hi> where he honoured me ſo far, as to enquire of me: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I was extreamly vexed at the purſuit which I ſaw he made of this faire Lady, I could
not perfectly ſhake off my ſickneſſe; but being neither well nor ill, I languiſhed away ſuch
a melancholly life, as I became ſcarce knowable: The King hearing of it, ſent ſeverall
times to viſit me, and he himſelfe condeſcended to come and ſee me, but ſpoke not a word
of <hi>Daphnide,</hi> nor made any ſhew of ſeeing her, or had her ſo much as in memory. I for
my part, kept not ſuch a cloſe Guard upon my lips, but told him, that it grieved me ſo
much, that againſt his promiſe he ſhould uſe me thus, as the very ſight of him aggravated
my griefe, and augmented my ſickneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Since the laſt time that the King was with <hi>Daphnide,</hi> ſhe writ unto me onely as an
umbrage for her intentions, and to keep me as long as ſhe could from the knowledge of all
paſſages, though ſhe knew they would out at laſt: for the Courtſhip of Great Princes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53527:30"/>
cannot be long concealed. As for the Letters which ſhe received from him, ſhe ſent them
not unto me, as ſhe was wont to doe, unleſſe it were ſome out of which no great matter
could be collected, and thoſe very rarely. Thus did I fret away my time with ſuch heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking
thoughts, as when I think upon them, I cannot chuſe but wonder they did not
bring me to my Grave. Sometimes in the evening when the weather was fair, and the Sun
in decline of heat, I ſhould walke upon the bankes of the River <hi>Roſne,</hi> towards the houſe
of this fair one, and there all alone contemplate upon my own thoughts, until the Suns
light had left our Hemiſphere; and then I ſhould returne to my own lodging, and ſpend
the whole night in the ſame melancholly imaginations.</p>
                     <p>How often have I taken conjectures of my misfortune for certainties, and then wiſhed
my ſelfe out of this life, as thinking that I lived onely to reſent my own ſorrowes and her
treachery? How oft have I with diſdaine, thought my ſelfe a fond fool for loving ſuch a
weathercock beauty? how many times have I reſolved to break off all thoſe perfidious
bonds that tyed me to her ſervice? perfidious may I well call them, for all her oathes and
promiſes, which together with her beauty, tyed me to her ſervice, are all vanity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luders.</p>
                     <p>But alas, how oft have I alſo conſidered, that not being my ſelfe, I was not able either
to doe or reſolve upon any thing, but according to her will and by as that drew me unto
her? Till now, ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> my miſery was onely dubious, and hanged onely upon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition:
but now, ſee how the whole truth came to be diſcovered unto me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> was walking, as <hi>I</hi> told you, upon the bankes of <hi>Roſne,</hi> not with any intention to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
my ſelfe, but onely to entertaine my mortal thoughts one evening, as I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to my lodging, I ſaw a young Cavalier, who was one of my friends, whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſerved the King in his Courtſhip of this faire one; and he rid by me, and did not
know me, not imagining that he whom he ſaw could be alone ſo late, whom he knew
never uſed to walke ſo ſlenderly attended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but riding on a little further, and knowing and
ſervant that waited upon me at a diſtance, he asked him what he did in that place: and
my ſervant anſwering, that he waited there until I had done walking; the Cavalier pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
alighted from his horſe, and having ſaluted me, beſeeched me to pardon him, for
paſſing by and not knowing me. After ſome common diſcourſe which we had together
upon that ſubject, I asked him from whence he came, and whither he was going? He
who was altogether ignorant of my love unto this fair one, and knew nothing neither of
the Kings but by his father, he anſwered me with all freedom and plainneſſe. I come ſir,
ſaid he, from a place, where you are had in memory, and I have brought you a letter which
will teſtifie as much; then putting his hand into his pocket, he took it out, and withall
another, the ſuperſcription whereof I knew; and having a ſuſpition, that it was directed
unto the King; alſo ſeeing how free this young Cavalier was in his language, as I tooke
my owne letter, I asked him, for whom the other was: For whom (ſaid he) why?
it is to the King my Father is faln ſick, and he gave it unto me to carry unto the King:
He ſpake thus unto me, as thinking that I knew of the Kings love, as I did all other the
Kings buſineſſe before. Though this made a deep impreſſion upon my heart, yet I ſmiled
at his ſimplicity, and ſaid unto him: I doe believe, dear friend, that both you and your
Father, are put to very much trouble in the buſineſſe. Oh Sir, ſaid he very freely, I ſwear
unto you, that all the voyages of War which the King has taken has not been ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to us, as this curſed love hath been, eſpecially ſince the King in his return, went to
ſee that faire Lady; and you may imagine this a truth, by the ſickneſſe which my Father
hath gotten. My dear friend, replyed I, and embraced him ſuch as great Princes doe imploy
upon ſuch occaſions, are ſuch whom they beſt love; and therefore you are not a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
unto that fair Lady who is the cauſe; beſides your own merit, of the Kings love and
favour unto you. Sir, ſaid he unto me, I cannot tell what may happen; but I am affraid
that this Lady of whom you ſpeake, will ſo bewitch him, as none can have any ſhare in
the Kings favour and love but herſelf.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words went ſo to my heart, as they conſtrained me to diſmiſſe him ſooner then
otherwiſe I would: and having no curioſity to know any more, I told him purpoſely to
make him go away, that the King impatiently expected his coming, and that I would
not deprive him of his contentment by ſtaying him any longer.</p>
                     <p>Thus I remained all alone, unleſſe accompanied with ſo many diſmal and mortal
thoughts, as it was above an hour before I would return: but at laſt, night conſtraining
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53527:30"/>
me to retire into the Towne: I went unto my lodging with a defigne to depart all alone
the next morning, and ſo ſhun all manner of humane Company, as none ſhould ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me againe. And to begin, I went unto my Chamber by a backe ſtaires, and having
none but my Page with me, I went preſently to bed, and commanded him to tell all the
Company that expected me, how I was not well, and that I ſent him to bid them all
good night. I cloſed not an eye all the night long, and <hi>Aurora</hi> began to bluſh before
any mind of ſleep came upon me: And being in a full reſolution of departure a Feaver
ſeized upon me ſo violently, as I was conſtrained to deferre untill my recovery. I had not
yet looked into the Letter which <hi>Daphnide</hi> ſent me, having neither ſo much courage as to
ſee what was in it, nor hate enough to caſt it into the fire; but not knowing which of
theſe two I ſhould reſolve upon, I held it in my hand, and kept it two dayes before I
brought it to light: At laſt, being tranſported with choller one night when I was alone,
I muſt, ſaid I to my ſelfe, I muſt needs ſee the treachery of this perfidious woman, and
afterwards ſo exclude her out of all memory, that nothing may remaine of her in me
but eternall ſcorne. Upon this, raiſing my ſelfe up in my bed, I opened it, and by the
helpe of a wax Candle which ſtood by my bed ſide, I read what ſhe had written
unto me.</p>
                     <p>But, wiſe <hi>Adamas,</hi> unto what purpoſe ſhould I repeat here thoſe words which were
writ onely with an intention to delude me the longer: And againe, why ſhould I not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
them, ſince it is requiſite the Phiſitian ſhould know the wound, before he can apply
right remedy? I will therefore rehearſe them, not any thing to my conſolation, but onely
to let you ſee how I was uſed.</p>

that my diſeaſe increaſed very much; of which the great <hi>Eurick</hi> hearing, although he

made unto mee, yet after dinner he condeſcended to come and viſit me. I was indeed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

I ſcarcely ſpoke one word, he thought to waken me by talking of <hi>Daphnide,</hi> little think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that I knew how ſquares went betwixt them. He asked me how that fair one did, and
how long it was ſince I heard from her. I anſwered him very faintly, that I thought ſhe
was well, and that I never heard from her ſince the day that ſhe writ unto him, by
ſuch a man, and then I named the man who brought me the laſt Letter. The King bluſht
and at firſt would have denied that he received any from her; but I beſeeched him to
pardon me, for I knew he did, and that the ſame man who brought him his Letter,
brought one to me alſo. How? ſaid he then unto me, did ſhe then ſend one unto you?
Yes Sir, anſwered I, and moreover I know of the honour which you did her, in ſeeing her
at her houſe At this, he was a little confuſed, when he ſaw I knew what he thought me
ignorant of: and after a long pauſe: <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſaid he unto me, I muſt needs confeſſe
my fault, though to my ſhame: Tis true, I did ſee that Lady of whom you ſpeake
and have received Letters from her: and more then all this, I muſt confeſſe that I doe
love her above my own life.</p>
                     <p>I cannot deny but that in this I am a very bad Maſter, and a worſe friend to treat you
thus after ſo many promiſes to the contrary; but in my confeſſion of this perfidie, I can
ſay no more in my owne defence, but that I was deceived my ſelfe, before I deceived you:
I was perſwaded, that as I never met with any man living who could overcome me, ſo
much leſſe that a woman could be able to doe it; and in this opinion I promiſed you
that which ſince I find my ſelfe not able to performe. The confidence which I had in my

and of this Lady in particular; and my ſorrow is ſo much the greater, in that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
upon <hi>Alcidon,</hi> to his prejudice; <hi>Alcidon</hi> I ſay, whom I loved ſo well; and it is to
be beleeved, that ſince I have been ſo perfidious unto him, it is a thing abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for me to doe otherwiſe: <hi>Alcidon</hi> my dear friend, I freely make confeſſion of the
wrong which in ſpight of myſelfe, I have done you; proteſting that if I could any way
in the world pay that debt unto which I am obliged, I would preſently doe it, with as
good a heart, as ever I received any favour from heaven.</p>
                     <p>The King uttered theſe words in ſuch a diſcompoſed manner, and with ſuch a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as teſtified that his expreſſions did not come from his heart: And becauſe I ſaw him
ſtand ſilent, I anſwered him; Sir, ſaid I, all that is in the world were created to ſerve
your greatneſſe, eſpecially <hi>Alcidon</hi> who is ready to ſacrifice himſelfe upon the Altar of
your contentment: And the Heavens foreſeeing it impoſſible I ſhould be deprived of
<hi>Daphnide</hi> and live, will take away my life, leſt it ſhould be any obſtacle unto you: And
therefore welcome death, ſince my life cannot conduce to your contentment. Upon this,
I could not reſtraine my teares, and the King being moved at them, after a while of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
ſaid unto me: You cannot <hi>Acidon,</hi> wiſh me ſo ill, as the injury I have done you
does merit, I doe moſt ingeniouſly acknowledge it, and wiſh that my blood could reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
it; perhaps I ſhall doe it in time, but for the preſent there is no thought of it. And
yet for your ſatisfaction, I am reſolved upon any thing you would have me, onely take
heart and recover of your ſickneſſe; and beleeve to your contentment, that I will doe all
I can to procure it. After this, the King went out of my Chamber, leaving me in ſuch a
ſad condition as it is incredible any other than my ſelfe ſhould live under ſuch a load of
ſorrowes and deſpaires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcidon</hi> turmoiled with the memory of theſe painfull paſſages, and the wrong which
he received both from his Maſter and his Miſtreſſe, he loſt his ſpeech, ſo as after a while
of ſilence, when he offered to ſpeake, he could not; and therefore he was forced for a long
time to be ſilent; at laſt ſtriving with himſelfe he broke out with much adoe, and ſaid:
You ſee Madam, how in obedience to your commands, I make my old wounds bleed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh,
but when I conſider all is by your command I doe patiently indure all; but if
your Rigor be not greater than my Patience, I beſeech you helpe me to beare the burthen
which you have impoſed upon me, I meane in the continuance of this relation of my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
of which you may ſpeake with more aſſurance than I can; for in all that is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to be told, I am only the ſufferer of what you were pleaſed I ſhould endure. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
my requeſt is not unreaſonable, that the wiſe <hi>Adamas</hi> may underſtand from your
mouth the truth of thoſe things, whereof you only are the Author. <hi>Adamas</hi> not ſtaying
for the anſwer of <hi>Daphnide,</hi> turned towards her, and ſaid; Methinkes Madam the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53527:31"/>
of this Cavalier is reaſonable, and that by your owne ordinance impoſed upon him,
you are obliged unto it.</p>
                     <p>Reverend Father, anſwered ſhe, the law is not equall betwixt him and me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſince
you thinke it fit, I ſhall doe as you pleaſe; and I muſt tell you, that though <hi>Alcidon</hi>
hath ſpoken the truth, yet as good Orators uſe, he hath inſerted ſome words to the great
advantage of his cauſe: Then after ſhe had pauſed a while, ſhe continued the diſcourſe
thus.</p>

                     <head>The Sequel of the Hiſtory of Daphnide and Alcidon.</head>
                     <p>IT is a Proverbe full of reaſon, that Parties intereſted or prepoſſeſſed with any Paſſion,
can never be good judges, becauſe their judgements being offended, they can never
performe their perfect Functions, no more than a leg or an arme can which has any
great wound. <hi>Alcidon</hi> has made good the Proverb by the conſequences which he hath ſo
often drawne to my diſadvantage being byaſſed thereunto more by paſſion then by reaſon:
And becauſe my diſcourſe would be very long if I ſhould anſwer all his particular rovings
into Paſſion, I will omit them, and truly relate the remainder of our Fortune, and leave
you to cenſure of his paſſions. And to begin where he left, I will tell you Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that having received the Letter which he ſent unto me, unto which I returntd no
anſwer, becauſe the Meſſenger according to his command went preſently away without
bidding any adieu. I became the moſt deſolate perſon in the world, being taxed with a
crime (and with ſome colour of reaſon) which I could not helpe. I underſtood preſently
after by the Kings Letters, all the diſcourſe which they two had together, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by <hi>Alvian,</hi> whom I ſent purpoſely to ſee how he did, though I did not write,
who told me how ill he was.</p>
                     <p>I diſcourſed long with my ſelfe what I ſhould doe in the buſineſſe; for on the one ſide,
his affection to me invited me to goe unto him, and tell him how he was miſtaken: on
the other ſide, I durſt not doe it for fear of being blamed. I was long wavering in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
between theſe two conſiderations, before the Scale would turne to either ſide; but
at laſt, the returne of <hi>Alvian</hi> conſtrained be to goe unto him; for bringing me ſuch very
bad newes of his ſickneſſe, I caſt off all other conſiderations, and reſolved to ſee him:
In this determination I ſought out for ſome excuſe to colour my Voyage: And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after, a very good one preſented it ſelfe: For Peace being made, my Brother-in-law
was conſtrained to goe to <hi>Avignon</hi> about getting of a Cozen of his, who was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
in the Towne which was rendred unto the great <hi>Eurick;</hi> and who becauſe he
would needs contradict the generall reſolution, thoſe of the place ſeized upon him; and
though Peace was afterwards publiſhed, yet they would not ſet him at liberty, leaſt if
the warre ſhould breake out againe, he ſhould interpriſe ſomething againſt them: And
ſeeing there was ſome difficulty about his inlargement, and that the buſineſſe by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
would take up a long time, he would carry his wife with him, and he had a great
deſire of my Company, that I might be ſeen with him, if he was forced to make any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
unto the King. As ſoone as the husband made the motion unto me, I conſented
with a condition of my Mothers conſent: The good old woman gave her conſent as
ſoone as ever ſhe underſtood the cauſe; ſo as within two dayes after, we ſet forward, and
as fortune was, our lodging hapned to be directly over againſt the lodging of
<hi>Alcidon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His ſickneſſe was much ſpoken of, and the King went oft to ſee him, for he loved
him very well: but when he was advertiſed of my arrivall, he ſhewed himſelfe more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of his health than before: For whereas he was wont to ſee him but once or twice
in a weeke, ſince I came, he went to him every day, and as he went or came backe he
commonly came to my lodging. As for me, the ſame day I came I ſent to <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and
told him by <hi>Alvian,</hi> that if he was pleaſed, I would willingly come and ſee him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
as ſoone as I received his anſwer, I went thither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I found him very ill, and his Chamber
full of Phiſitians and Chyrurgians, ſo as at that time. our talke was onely of his mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
unto which, he anſwered very little, and ſighed much. The day after, I tooke my
time ſo conveniently as I found him almoſt all alone; and then after I asked him how he
did, he anſwered me with tears in his eyes, and in a feeble and languiſhing tone: Why
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53527:32"/>
Madam, ſaid he, doe you aske me any queſtions concerning that diſeaſe which you your
ſelfe have cauſed? you muſt needs know it better then I, or all my Phyſicians. <hi>Alcidon,</hi>
anſwered I, I doe indeed know part of your diſeaſe, which is that of your minde; but I
am altogether ignorant of your corporal diſeaſe, and it is that which I am moſt affraid
of: for, as for the other, I am confident you will quickly recover. Ah <hi>Daphnide</hi> (ſaid
he unto me, with a deep ſigh) I ſee by this, that you have moſt care of that part which
leaſt does merit it: for, if there be any thing in me which is commendable, it is this ſoul,
with which I have not onely loved you, but even adored you, with ſuch a pure and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
affection, as I believe none but your ſelfe could ſleight it as you do. This anſwer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
I, argues your diſeaſe; but have all the care you can for the cure of your body,
and you will finde that the diſeaſe of your ſoule is not mortal; at leaſt, if there be any
ſparke of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>aſon yet remaining in you. I doe know, anſwered he, that the diſeaſe of my
ſoule is not mortal; for our Druids tell us, that the ſoul never dies, but is immortall:
but ſince the diſeaſe of my body, will not cure the diſeaſe of my ſoule, I will further it
with my own hands ere long, that I may no longer look upon a perſon with the eyes of
love, who has ſo little in her ſoule. I perceive, replyed I, that you are deeply wounded,
and your greateſt paine is in your opinion: you thinke that the addreſſes of the Great
<hi>Eurick</hi> have ſuch an influence upon me, that they will extinguiſh that affection which I
have promiſed unto you. Is not this your diſeaſe <hi>Alcidon?</hi> Doe you not think you have
reaſon to complaine againſt me, and your fortune, which was to love a perſon ſo waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and inconſtant? To this he anſwered very faintly; Did you as well know how to
cure, as to find out my diſeaſe, I ſhould confeſſe you to be an excellent good Phyſitian.
It is as eaſie to cure it, replyed I, as to know it. And to begin; tell me <hi>Alcidon,</hi> how came
you to know, that <hi>I</hi> doe not love you? is it not by thoſe anſwers which <hi>I</hi> have given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King, and by ſuffering my ſelfe to be ſeen and courted by him? But lay aſide your
Paſſion a little, and conſider who King <hi>Eurick</hi> is; who <hi>I</hi> am; and in what times we live
in: You ſee <hi>Eurick</hi> is a great Prince, who is able to doe what he will: againſt whom,
Cities, Provinces, nay whole Kingdomes are not able to reſiſt, when he is pleaſed to turne
his Arms againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Doe you think that love is not as ſtrong a paſſion in him, as his ambition? Can you
believe that I am able to reſiſt his force, more then ſo many millions of perſons? you know
that I am his ſubject; that I dwell in the Country which he hath conquered, and in a
time when he thinks all forfeited unto him: Can you thinke me well adviſed, if I ſhould
diſdaine and reject him. Doe you think he would ſuffer me to live quietly in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
if I ſhould treat him ſo, eſpecially knowing from your own mouth my love unto
you? He would alſo accuſe You of all the harſh treatment that he received from Me. Is it
poſſible your paſſion ſhould ſo blind your eyes, as not to ſee that the onely remedy is this
which I have uſed? Into what a ſtrange fury would his diſdained love turn, if it ſhould
beſleighted? the name of hatred is too low; ſome new phraſe which ſignifies hatred,
muſt be invented, before it can be rightly expreſſed: hatred, anger, rage, fury, deſire of
revenge, nay tyranny, and cruelty, will not ſignifie his Diſguſt. Then <hi>Alcidon,</hi> conſider,
into what a condition I ſhould have brought you &amp; my ſelf alſo, if I had taken that courſe;
the leaſt you could have expected, is baniſhment out of all his Dominions; and the leaſt
that I could look for, is a thouſand wrongs and affronts, which neither you nor I could
ever have endured without death or revenge: ſee into what extremities we ſhould have
brought ourſelves, and what contentments we may well hope for by living thus; confeſs
my counſel to be the beſt, ſince it ſecures us from all danger, and makes a way for us to
live happily together, and with more contentment than ever we did. Alas, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he, how eaſie a thing it is to know, that all theſe reaſons are but meer excuſes, for
did you intend as you ſay, why did you conceal the matter from me? why did you not
diſcover it at the firſt, but made uſe of ſo many ſhifts and deluſions, as may well be called
treachery, of which I had never known, unleſſe I had made the diſcovery by a meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent?
I ſhall in this confeſſe the very truth, anſwered I, I thought you to be ſo farre from
this opinion, that I thought it to no purpoſe to tell you, but to uſe you as children are uſed
who are ſick, they ſweeten the edges of the Cup which holds the bitter medicine, and ſo
tempt them to take it the more eaſily, and by this meanes preſerve their lives; aſſuring
my ſelfe, that you would not take it ill when you knew my intention, but would reliſh
both the benefit, and the medicine. Alas, ſaid he unto me, with a deep ſigh, a medicine
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53527:32"/>
more bitter and difficult to take and endure, than the diſeaſe is of which you would cure
me. All ſick people, anſwered I, when Medicines are preſented unto them, do ſay as much
as you, but when they find the good effects, and recover health, then they commend both
the medicine and Phyſician, and reward them with a thankful Fee: and I hope that ere long
you will do the like.</p>
                     <p>He would have anſwered, but was prevented by a great company of Cavaliers, who
came to viſit him; and preſently after, I left him with them, not fully ſatisfied in his
mind, but ſo diſpoſed, that my arguments began to worke with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becauſe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
his recovery above all things, I ſaw him againe two or three dayes after, and uſed
ſuch arguments, that he conſidering the ſtate of things, and that there was no remedy, he
conſented I ſhould continue ſo with <hi>Eurick:</hi> upon which, I made a promiſe unto him,
that as he was the firſt I ever loved, ſo ſhould he be the laſt, and that I would love him until
I was in my Grave: That the affection which I bare unto <hi>Eurick,</hi> might be called Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſtate, and that which I bare unto him, might be called Love of heart.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, Reverend Father, were the remedies which <hi>I</hi> uſed to cure this ſick man, and
they had ſuch an operation upon him, that he began to recover, and riſe out of his bed;
ſo as before <hi>I</hi> went from <hi>Avignion</hi> he was perfectly well, and ſo contented that <hi>I</hi> ſhould
ſmile upon the King, that he himſelfe would often come with him, when he came to viſit
me. The truth is, <hi>I</hi> was put to uſe all my art in carrying my ſelfe ſo ſwimingly, as to
perſwade the King that <hi>I</hi> was quite off the hinges with <hi>Alcidon;</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> had much
a doe to perſwade him that he had no deſigne upon me; for the King knowing what good
will had been betwixt us, he could not believe that he could out of reſpect unto him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
his flames unto me: Alſo conſidering, that <hi>Alcidon</hi> was young and hanſome,
and at a right age for love, he thought him ſo fit a ſubject for my love, as he could not
thinke I could quit <hi>Alcidon</hi> for him. Thus did he live long in jealous ſuſpition; but the
diſcreet carriage of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and my coldneſſe towards him, did make him loſe that
opinion; and therefore thinking himſelf ſole poſſeſſor of my affection, he openly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his love unto me; ſo as after my brother in law by my mediation had obtained his
deſires, he ſent for my Father and Mother to come unto him, purpoſely as an excuſe for
his deſires of having me near him. Although they were both very old, yet ambition
which alwaies takes more root in the ſoules of old people, then in young, did in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his commands, move them to leave their homes in hopes of preferment unto grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
favours.</p>
                     <p>Now are both become Courtiers, and the King did not deceive their hopes, for he
loaded them with wealth and honours, which yet they did not long enjoy; for whether it
was that their age was arrived at that term, beyond which none can paſſe: or whether it
was that the Turmoiles and noiſe of the Court did abridge their lives; yet ſo it was, that
they both dyed preſently after, as if they came to the Court onely to leave me in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, for otherwiſe, I durſt not have come: but being there, I ſtayed there under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
of taking order about ſome domeſtique buſineſſe which was left upon me, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
when the Kings affection to me was publiſhed in hopes to be his wife, as he himſelf
divulged.</p>
                     <p>During all this time, few dayes paſſed without giving <hi>Alcidon</hi> an opportunity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me in private, and in which I did not ſpend two hours at the leaſt with him, which
alwaies ſeemed ſhort unto me when we parted: He knowes very well that all this is true,
and that many times in teſtimony of my good affection to him, I have put both him and
my ſelfe in very great danger of life and honour. The truth is, I muſt needs commend
both him and his diſcretion in this, that what opportunities ſoever I gave him, and what
favours ſoever I ſhewed unto him, he never offered to go beyond the limits of honeſty:
and though I believe, he thought that I would not ſuffer him, yet I am much obliged
unto him, in that he never gave me any cauſe to repent of my kindneſs to him.</p>
                     <p>Living thus in the flow of contentment, though I was in continuall feare leſt the
King ſhould come to know of this good will: and leſt that ſhould give him occaſion to
change, as he had already done to the diſadvantage of others; I obſerved that there was
many great Ladies, who to enjoy the favour and poſſeſſion of this Prince, whether it was
out of a deſire of the Glory to command him, whom ſo many millions obeyed; or out
of a ſpiring hopes to obtain a Crown, I cannot tell; but they were very aſſiduous in
ſprucing themſelves up in hopes to be pleaſing in the Kings eye. Amongſt the reſt, I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53527:33"/>
two; the one was called <hi>Clarinta,</hi> and the other <hi>Adelonda:</hi> As for <hi>Clarinta,</hi> I
muſt needs confeſſe I never ſaw a fairer, nor more meritorious of love, having all the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
qualities that are deſirable. In the firſt place, Envy it ſelfe could not find the leaſt tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of a defect in her face; ſhe had a hand, no eye ere ſaw a fairer nor better proportioned;
her ſtature was tall, ſtraight and ſlender, and the Majeſty of her mind was ſuch, as if ſhe
were borne purpoſely to weare a Crowne, as many of her Anceſtors formerly had done:
And to make her Charmes the more inevitable, the Univerſe had not a finer wit, the
rayes of which ſhined in all her actions: but eſpecially her ſpeech was ſo infinitely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
that not to be taken with her, there was no other remedy, but not to ſee and heare
her. To be briefe; I muſt confeſſe, that were I a man, I had devoted my ſelfe her adorer,
what treatment ſoever had I found; and woman as I was, I was never ſatisfied but when I
ſaw her, and was with her, although ſo many perfections and merits gave me ſufficient
cauſe to hate her, becauſe of the deſigne which I had, and the pretenſion which
I know ſhe had.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Adelonda,</hi> truth is, ſhe was faire, but not comparable to <hi>Clarinta;</hi> neither
in beauty nor merit; and moreover, being married, ſhe could not have the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
pretenſions of the other ſo as though I was not troubled much to ſee <hi>Eurick</hi>
carraſſe her, yet the other gave great guſts of ſuſpition; and therefore I reſolved to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the mind of the King firſt from her, and afterwards at more leiſure from <hi>Adelonda;</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when I ſaw that he went ſometimes unto her. And though at the firſt he feigned that
he did viſit her, not out of love, but only honour; yet afterwards his viſits were ofter
than uſuall, and he hid them from me, as much as he could. I quickly obſerved this my
ſelfe beſides thoſe ſpies which I had continually about the Prince, did preſently advertiſe
me of it. After I had well conſulted with my ſelfe upon the beſt remedy againſt this ſtorm;
at laſt, I bethought me of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> thinking that if he would ſecond me in it, my deſigne
might happily proſper. And becauſe the matter required preſent expedition, the firſt time
I had an opportunity of talking with him alone, I uſed this language.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcidon,</hi> I am unreſolved whether or no I ſhould impart a buſineſſe unto you, which
troubles me more than I am able to expreſſe, fearing leaſt the affection which you beare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, ſhould make you take my words otherwiſe then I deſire: and yet if you doe but
conſider how I have lived with you for the time paſt, and what evident teſtimonies I have
given you of my good will, I am confident you will thinke that it is onely the neceſſity
of our affaires which conſtraines me to deſire a thing of you, which I have hitherto delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
You know, how as my fortune is, all that looke upon me, are enviers of my happines;
ſo as I muſt ſtand upon my guard againſt all perſons who would if they could ſtep into my
roome. The affection which you have promiſed unto me, and that which I bear unto
you, does ſtrongly invite you to have an eſpeciall care of me, but more of your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation:
For though none knowes of the great league that is betwixt us; yet few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
but know that you have beene ever well affected to me. Now Maxims of ſtate doe
ſay, that the fortune of the head ought to be communicated to the Members; ſo as your
ruine is moſt evident if mine befall me. I lay theſe inſtances before your eyes, to the end
you may not think that ſtrange which I am conſtrained to propound for our preſervation.
You ſee how <hi>Clarinta,</hi> whether relying upon the grandure of her parents, or building her
deſigne upon the foundation of her beauty, I cannot tell, but you ſee how ſhe endeavours to
get the good will of <hi>Eurick,</hi> and which is worſe, her labour, is not loſt, for methinks
that Prince begins to thinke her more amiable than I wiſh he did; you know how flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and alterable his mind is, and how hitherto none could make him fix.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Clarinta</hi> ſhould compaſſe her deſigne, conſider how ſhe would baniſh us from Court,
leaſt ſhe her ſelfe ſhould fall into like confuſion, wherein ſhe has brought us. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
things proceed any further we muſt by way of prevention uſe all the arts we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
for a ſhelter againſt this ſtorm. To thinke of uſing violence, and to force the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſpirit of this Prince, would ſhew ignorance in thoſe effects which love uſeth at the
beginning to produce, for nothing makes it greater than oppoſition, like unto a coale
which the wind makes blaze by blowing upon it. To thinke that diſſimulation will
mend the matter, and in ſeeming not to know it, that time may produce ſome good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
is very bad, and dangerous counſell: For although Love which findes no oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may by little and little loſe it ſelfe, and become nothing, yet as this caſe ſtands, the
danger will be inevitable; for love does never leſſen till after fruition: <hi>Clarinta</hi> cannot
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53527:33"/>
be enjoyed till after the marriage; and after marriage though <hi>Eurick</hi> ſhould alter his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
yet notwithſtanding, ſhe would be Queen of the Viſigots, and we by conſequence
ſubject unto her will, and liable to all her violences. So that upon ſerious conſideration,
I can finde no better remedy againſt this menacing danger, than this which I ſhall propoſe
unto you, which once more I conjure you to take in a right ſenſe, and not upon any other
ſurmiſes than as I intend it. You cannot be ignorant how liberall the heavens has beene
unto you in the gifts of Nature, and in accompliſhing you every way above other men:
you have had ſufficient proofes of it in all your attempts: I make no doubt but if you
would caſt your flaming eye a little upon <hi>Clarinta</hi> ſhe would preſently melt at the charms
of it, and unleſſe her heart be made of ſtone, ſhe cannot avoid the amiable glances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
If you would put this my requeſt in execution, moſt certainly ſhe would love you,
and preſently reject <hi>Eurick</hi> and all his ambition; ſhe would wholly devote her ſelfe unto
you, or elſe <hi>Eurick</hi> ſeeing his addreſſe, and her entertainment of it, he will diſdaine her
and retire: Thus ſhall we avoid a misfortune which does much threaten us; if you can
tell me any better expedient, I beſeech you propoſe it, that we may make choice of the
beſt: I have long deferred the making of this over-ture, fearing leaſt you ſhould have an
opinion, that I propoſed it as a way to rid my ſelfe of you, though my intention onely
is, that we may live together for the future in more contentment and ſafety.</p>
                     <p>This was the language I uſed unto <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſo plainly demonſtrating my intention
unto him, as I could not imagine that he ſhould be diſcontented at it, or ſuſpect that I had
any other aime then what I told him: yet for all my aſſurances of the contrary, and mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
all my reaſons and arguments, he was perſwaded that my deſigne in this motion was,
to ſet him further from me, and then to comply more freely with great <hi>Eurick.</hi> After a
long muſing ſilence, and fixing his eyes upon the ground, he looked up, and with a ſmile
which ſpoke his diſcontent, he anſwered me; I wiſh, Madam, that I could ſerve you in
this according as you deſire: and indeed I will, for your deſire is to me a moſt full
command: but my heart tells me, that a great misfortune will take original from this
command; yet obey it I will, not out of any hopes I have in thoſe favours which you ſay
the heavens have ſo liberally indowed me withal, but onely to let you ſee that I will obey
you in all things as long as I live. Oh Heavens! cannot the King be contented in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
of your love, but he muſt needes make me entirely miſerable? Oh <hi>Alcidon,</hi> haſt
thou a heart that can ſupport theſe injuries of fortune? But why ſhould I not endure them,
ſince the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> commands it ſo: then turning towards me with abundance of
reverence, Yes, yes, Madam, ſaid he unto me, I will doe as you command me, though it
coſt me a life, and all manner of contentment.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, he would have gone away, but I held him by the arme, and after a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
urging of my Arguments, and adding the beſt motives I had, I deſired him, that
though our ruines would be inevitable if not prevented; yet if it went ſo much againſt
his minde, that he would not attempt it, for no misfortune whatſoever would be more
grievous unto me then his diſpleaſure: but ſtill if he would allow of reaſon, he would
plainly ſee that he was erronious, in having any ſuch opinions, and that he did exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
offend me in entertaining them. Madam, ſaid he, If I doe offend you in it, <hi>I</hi> will
preſently doe my penance in obeying your command; and ſo as <hi>I</hi> am confident you will
pitty me for it, but I pray heaven your pitty come not too late: yet <hi>I</hi> am ſo entirely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
unto whatſoever is your will, as I proteſt obedience unto whatſoever you ſhall
command; and doe not believe that <hi>I</hi> will faile in it, further then my power fails me:
and though you doe ſee me make a little doe at your command, yet <hi>I</hi> beſeech you thinke
that it proceeds from no other cauſe, then from my abundance of affection, which cannot
endure to heare of the leaſt thought of any ſeparation from you; or that <hi>I</hi> am able to
make any addreſſes of love unto any whomſoever but your ſelfe, unleſſe it be under a guiſe
of diſſimulation, and that too with inſufferable paine unto me. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſaid <hi>I</hi> then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, <hi>I</hi> am not now to begin the knowledge of your affection to me, nor of your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
to have my reciprocall love: but <hi>I</hi> pray you believe, that unleſſe death doe very
ſuddenly ſurpriſe me, <hi>I</hi> ſhall in ſome ſort come out of your debt, and pay my moſt due
acknowledgements, for any thing <hi>I</hi> either have or ſhall receive from you. And that you
may more clearly ſee the end <hi>I</hi> aime at, <hi>I</hi> doe promiſe you, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and ſwear by the
great God who puniſheth all falſe Oathes, that all the paines you ſhall imploy in the
Courtſhip of <hi>Clarinta,</hi> ſhall be put upon my ſcore and account, and that it ſhall be my
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53527:34"/>
ſelfe who will pay you your wages. Methinkes that if <hi>Alcidon</hi> did love me, theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
would content him; and yet <hi>I</hi> perceive this enterpriſe goes againſt his heart, and
he will attempt it, onely becauſe he will not diſobey me But ſo it was, that in obſervance
of his promiſe to me, he reſolved upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and according to his beſt diſcretion, he began
this addreſſe, in which truly he found more difficulty then we imagined, and much more
had met with, if fortune had not removed ſome great impediments, by an encounter
which I ſhall relate unto you.</p>

                  <div type="history">
                     <head>The Hiſtory of the Artifice of Alcires.</head>
                     <p>IT is eaſie to be imagined, that <hi>Clarinta</hi> being ſuch a captivating beauty, and brought
up in a Court full of generous young Gallants, was not long without many ſervants:
Amongſt the reſt, there was two who under an umbrage of Conſanguinity, had inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
themſelves highly into her favour: The one was called <hi>Amintor,</hi> and the other
<hi>Alcires,</hi> both of them indeed very valiant and amiable Cavaliers. And who, if <hi>I</hi> be not
miſtaken, did imbarque themſelves at firſt into the affection of this beauty, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of friendſhip; a ſubtilty very ordinary and often uſed by love, the better to ſurpriſe
thoſe who are of harder tempers to give it entertainment, Beſides the kindred which was
between theſe two Gallants, their long education together, the conformity of exerciſes
unto which they addicted themſelves, and their concurrency in age did unite them in a
ſtrong league of friendſhip, and adopted them brothers in matter of Armes, and to ſweare
amity and aſſiſtance of each other: But love which never admits of any companion, did
make a fraction in this league of friendſhip, as hereafter I ſhall relate unto you. Fire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſo hid, but ſome ſmoak will appeare, but I believe it is a matter more hard to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
love long, eſpecially from thoſe who have any intereſt in it. And therefore <hi>Alcires</hi>
finding that <hi>Amintor</hi> did thrive in his addreſſes better then himſelfe, and ſeeing all juſt
wayes would not avail him, he reſolved to have recourſe unto ſubtilty, thinking that, ſo
he could overcome, all wayes are allowable in Love.</p>
                     <p>It is uſuall amongſt perſons of any quality, to make choice of one amongſt their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
whom they make a confident, and truſt ſuch a one more then any other: <hi>Clarinta</hi>
made choice of one amongſt her maids, whom ſhe loved very well, and truſted with her
moſt intimate ſecrets. <hi>Alcires,</hi> who knew what prevalence ſuch ſervants uſe to have with
their Miſtreſſes, had long before hand courted the good will of this wench; and being a
brave Gallant, and very liberal, he got himſelfe ſo farre in her favour, as he could mould
her into a model: ſo as when <hi>Amintor</hi> and he met together at the faire <hi>Clarinta's,</hi> he
would alwaies yield place unto him, and entertaine this wench who ſtood a diſtance from
them: And when he ſaw <hi>Amintor</hi> look upon him, he would alwaies have ſome ſecret to
whiſper in her eare and ſmile, doing all he could to make <hi>Amintor</hi> enter into ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amintor</hi> obſerving this, as the nature of lovers is, he preſently ſuſpected that this
familiarity betwixt them proceeded from ſome greater cauſe then from that wench, and
perhaps from ſome deſign which <hi>Alcires</hi> had upon the Miſtreſſe. <hi>Amintor</hi> being a man of
a free open heart, and one that could not long ſmother his thoughts from a friend, one
day meeting with a fit opportunity, he ſaid thus unto him: Good <hi>Alcires,</hi> what buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of importance could you have with <hi>Clarinta's</hi> maid, which made you ſo earneſt with
her as you ſeemed? <hi>Alcires</hi> ſeeing his plot began to take, did at firſt anſwer him onely
with a ſmile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and afterwards, would you have me tell you? ſaid he, you doe ſo wholly
take up the Miſtreſſe when you are with her, as I being all alone, am forced to take up
with what you leave me, the maid: But heretofore, ſaid <hi>Amintor,</hi> you were not wont
to doe thus, and I am no more a taker up of the Miſtreſſe, then I was wont to be; what
new mood has of late poſſeſſed you? <hi>Alcires</hi> pauſed a while before he anſwered, and
then looked upon him with a ſubtile ſmile; at which <hi>Amintor</hi> was more troubled then
before, and ſeeing that he ſpoke not a word; Why, ſaid he, doe you not give me an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
have I any intereſt in your familiarity with her? if I have, I pray let me know
it, that I may ſhare in your mirth. <hi>Alcires</hi> then, ſetting a more ſerious face upon the
matter: <hi>Amintor,</hi> ſaid he unto him, Although there was no ligaments of Conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
us, yet as I am your friend, you may eaſily believe, that I will impart any thing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53527:34"/>
unto you; and the very truth is, I had long ſince acquainted you with what you deſire
to know at this time, had I not feared your diſguſt of it; and this conſideration will ſtill
ſtop my mouth, unleſſe you aſſure me of the contrary. I will not give you that aſſurance,
ſaid he, if you tell it with an intention of diſpleaſing me; but if you tell it with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
that I may prevent any inconveniency, I ſhall think it a very great obligation. If
you will promiſe me, ſaid <hi>Alcires,</hi> to uſe it with diſcretion, and to take well the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
which I ſhall give you, onely with intention to bring you forth of a great error,
I am very ready to tell it you, as your kinſman, and as your friend: but otherwiſe I ſhall
not; for unleſſe you make good uſe of it, it may doe you much hurt. Then <hi>Amintor</hi>
making that promiſe unto him, <hi>Alcires</hi> went thus on: Know <hi>Amintor,</hi> that after a long
Courtſhip of the faire <hi>Clarinta,</hi> I proſpered ſo well, that ſhe is intirely mine, aad I have
enjoyed her. Oh Heavens! ſaid <hi>Amintor,</hi> doe you know what you ſay? have you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<hi>Clarinta?</hi> Yes, yes, ſaid <hi>Alcires,</hi> I have enjoyed her, and therefore ſet your heart
at reſt; for ſhe is ſo much mine, as very few nights paſſe, but I am with her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ſee I ſhun her company as much as I can, purpoſely to deceive inquiſitive eyes,
as ſhe deſired me. Oh ye Gods, ſaid <hi>Amintor,</hi> and lifted up his hands; Oh heavens!
will you not puniſh her? I aſſure you, ſaid <hi>Alcires,</hi> that I had a longing deſire to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, becauſe I was extreamly ſorry to ſee you ſo deceived: but as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I much feared that it would vex and diſpleaſe you. <hi>Amintor</hi> upon this folded his
Arms, and ſtood ſilent a long time; at laſt ſaid thus, I ſhould be extreamly angry with
you <hi>Alcires,</hi> for raviſhing <hi>Clarinta</hi> from me, did I not know that when we both cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Clarinta,</hi> we had no deſigne of deceiving one another: for as thoſe who run for a
priſe, though many run, yet onely one can win it: ſo I have no reaſon to be angry with
you for winning <hi>Clarinta</hi> from me; but rather, I have reaſon to thanke you for telling me,
that I may run on no longer in an error: only one thing wants, which would ſum up
my obligation, and which I conjure you unto; which is, that you will ſatisfie my eyes in
the truth of this, as well as you have done my eares. I ſhall give you as good ſatisfaction
as I can, anſwered <hi>Alcires,</hi> but I am afraid it will onely feſter your wound the more, and
be a greater diſpleaſure unto you. No, no, replyed <hi>Amintor,</hi> it cannot more diſpleaſe me,
but will rather encourage my reſolution to doe as I ought: <hi>Alcires</hi> ſeemed to be a little
puzled at this queſtion, but he foreſaw it, and therefore prepared himſelfe for it from the
firſt: Truly <hi>Amintor,</hi> ſaid he, I know not well how to ſatisfie the nice curioſity
of your eye; for I have a good deſire to give full contentment, yet I am afraid it will be
abſineſſe of difficulty to get you into her Chamber, becauſe it is not every night I go
unto her, but onely when the opportunity falls hanſomly out for it, which ſhe cannot let
me know of, until every one be in bed: beſides, I know how to get in, but you will be
ſeen. Nay, nay, ſaid <hi>Amintor,</hi> I deſire not to go ſo farre, I had the ſame conſideration with
my ſelfe; It will ſatisfie me, if I can but be with you, and ſee when your ſelf go into her
Chamber. If that be enough, anſwered <hi>Alcires</hi> preſently, you ſhall be fully ſatisfied, and
perhaps this very night if you ſtay in my Chamber: then <hi>Amintor</hi> promiſing he would,
they parted in this reſolution.</p>
                     <p>See, ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> unto what impoſtures we women are ſubject unto, by the example of
this wiſe and faire Lady, who though ſhe was clearly innocent, yet by the calumny of
<hi>Alcires,</hi> was deemed as culpable by <hi>Amintor.</hi> He went and waited with a longing impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency,
untill the crafty <hi>Alcires</hi> came and called him: <hi>Alcires</hi> in the interim hoping to
compleat his plot, which he had thought was well begun, and having long before reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon this way; the time being come when every one went to bed, he came to <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
and told him he would conduct him to the promiſed place. The King who tooke
great delight in bring amongſt Ladies, had lodged <hi>Clarinta, Adelonda,</hi> and me, in his
Palace, pretending it as a great honour unto us: <hi>Clarintas</hi> quarter was a ground Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
near the Court, and had onely three or four ſteps unto it: from oft the halfe part of
theſe little ſtaires, one might go into her Chamber ſeverall wayes; through one doore, one
came into a great Dining room, and a drawing room, out of which was a paſſage through
a little dark Gallery, which conducted into her Cloſet by a back door; and here it was
where <hi>Clarinta</hi> commonly lay; and if one would go further without going into her Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
they needed onely to open a door cloſe by, through which they came into a great
Chamber that conducted out of the Palace, by a Gate very ſeldom frequented.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcires</hi> having long before hand obſerved theſe things, he conducted <hi>Amintor</hi> into
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53527:35"/>
his little dark Gallery, where ſtaying without any light when all were in bed, he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o
him; you ſhall ſee <hi>Amintor,</hi> that as ſoon as I knock at the Cloſet door, it will be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto me but <hi>I</hi> beſeech you according to your promiſe, return as ſoon as ever you ſee
me entred in: then leaving him ſome five or ſix paces from the door, he ſeemed to goe
unto it, but went unto the other which paſſed into the great Chamber, and which being
ſo neare <hi>Clarintas</hi> Cloſet, <hi>Amintor</hi> could not ſee the great difference; then after <hi>Alcires</hi>
had ſtayed a little while, he returned unto <hi>Amintor,</hi> and whiſpering him in his eare, told
him that they were come a little to late, for all were aſleep, but yet he heard them riſing:
but <hi>I</hi> beſeech you o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce more, ſaid he, that when <hi>I</hi> am entred, you may goe away as ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
us you can, and in the mean time ſtand a little further off leſt when the door opens and
a Candle come, you ſhould be ſeen. <hi>Amintor</hi> did ſo, little dreaming of his ſubtilty, which
was onely to get him further off the Cloſet door, leſt he ſhould ſee the difference of the
Doores: <hi>Alcires</hi> then going as gently as he could unto this door, he opened that which
paſſed into the great Chamber, and preſently ſhut it after him; for the ſpring lock was
made after ſuch a faſhion, as it would ſhut of it ſelfe, and <hi>Alcires</hi> having obſerving it, he
came a little before, and had left it half open. <hi>Amintor</hi> hearing it open, and ſhut preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againe, did verily believe that it was <hi>Clarinta's</hi> Cloſet doore; and probably any other,
beſides him, might have been deceived, the doores being ſo neare each other, and the
place ſo darke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for better aſſurance, he went and laid his eare to the doore, and
hearkned if he could heare any talke, or any noiſe; but whether it was that the
noiſe which <hi>Alcires</hi> made, had wakned ſome in <hi>Clarinta'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> Chamber, or whether it was
his owne imagination which made him thinke ſo; yet ſo it was, that he had an opinion
he heard a noiſe, which tranſported him into ſuch a fury, as he was ready to breake the
doore open with his foot; but thinking upon the promiſe he had paſſed unto <hi>Alcires,</hi> and
the kindred between them: alſo conſidering into what a confuſion he ſhould put all the
houſe into, he had ſo much power over himſelf as to forbeare, and go away, but ſo vexed
as he could not reſt all the night. On the other ſide, <hi>Alcires</hi> having play'd his part ſo
well thus far, and fearing leſt <hi>Amintor</hi> ſhould look for him at his Chamber, he would
not go unto it, nor unto any other place where any one might ſay the next day that they
ſaw him, and there paſſed all the night away in a grotto of the Garden, whereof he had
got the key: judge you into what a perplexity he put <hi>Amintor,</hi> and how prudently wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
a Lover ought to be in avoiding the artifices of a Rivall. The diſpleaſure of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
was ſuch, as not being willing to declare it unto any, he was conſtrained to keepe
his bed, and murmur away the time againſt a malady, without looking for any remedy;
of which <hi>Clarinta</hi> being advertiſed by common reports, and being ignorant of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
her love to him forced her unto a viſit; and ſhe found him ſo full of ſorrowes, that
he could hardly look upon her, which ſhe attributed unto the greatneſſe of his malady:
but going another time to viſit him, and ſtill finding him more melancholly and cold
then at the firſt time, ſhe could not chuſe but ſay thus unto him; Is your ſickneſſe <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
ſo extream, that it does not onely make a change in your face, but in your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
alſo, which is ſo much different from what it was wont to be, that indeed you are
not knowable? Ah <hi>Clarinta,</hi> anſwered he and ſighed, how happy had it been for me, if
this alteration had come ſooner? ſhe ſtood aſtoniſhed at this anſwer; and when ſhe would
have continued diſcourſe, his Phyſitians came unto him, ſo as ſhe durſt not make any
further replies; but after a little longer ſtay, ſhe went away, the worſt ſatisfied perſon in
the world: in the meane time, <hi>Alcires</hi> to loſe no time in the ſeconding ſo good a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and to comply with all occaſions that preſented themſelves, he grew more kinde
and familiar with <hi>Amintor</hi> then before, and kept himſelfe ſo conſtantly near him, as it
was impoſſible for any to ſpeak with him, and he not heare. For knowing very well
that his diſeaſe proceeded from deſpaire principally, he was loath any ſhould undeceive
him, or let him know the truth. But becauſe he had not yet accompliſhed his chiefe
worke, but thought it neceſſary that as he had deceived <hi>Amintor,</hi> ſo to deceive <hi>Clarinta</hi>
alſo, purpoſely to make her fly from him, as he fled from her: one day therefore when
he was with his companion alone in his Chamber, he made a ſhew as if he would write
ſomething which was of ſome importance; but as if his fancy was not pleaſed with
what he writ, he raced out ſometimes a word, and ſometimes a whole line; and at laſt,
as if he were angry at the dulneſſe of his genius, he tore the paper in pieces, and flung away
the Pen; at which <hi>Amintor</hi> ſmiling, and wondering at it, he asked him, why he did ſo?
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53527:35"/>
I aſſure you, anſwered he, that my wits are off the hinges this day; This morning the
King commanded me to write a Letter of thankes unto a Lady, for ſome favour which
ſhe had done him, and to carry it to him when I had done, that he might tranſcribe it;
but my genius is ſo dull to day, that I am not able to write one ſignificant ſyllable to the
purpoſe. <hi>Amintor</hi> loving <hi>Alcires,</hi> and knowing that <hi>Eurick</hi> uſed to imploy his friends
ſometimes in ſuch Commiſſions, whom he thought had a happy faculty in penning; he
would try whether his malady would permit him to write this Letter for his friend, and
taking his ſcribled Paper out of his hand, the better to hint him upon the ſubject, he
writ theſe Lines.</p>

                        <hi>Alcires</hi> did deſire no more, but that <hi>Amintor</hi> ſhould write ſuch a Letter upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
not with intention to give it unto the King, as he pretended; but to effect another
deſigne which he had plotted in himſelfe; he much commended therefore the acuteneſſe
of his fancy, and his facility of expreſſion; then thanked him for it, and put it in his
pocket: after this he went away, pretending to tranſcribe it in his Cloſet, where he was
to doe ſuch things. By fortune, the rude Copy which he firſt writ, remained upon
the Table, which the poore ſick <hi>Amintor</hi> laid up in a little drawer where he was wont
to put ſuch Papers, without any other deſigne but that it might not be ſeen. <hi>Alcires</hi> in
the mean time, ſealed the Letter, but gave it no ſuperſcription, and went to <hi>Clarinta,</hi>
taking a time when he thought to find her alone. Two dayes were already expired, ſince
the laſt time <hi>Clarinta</hi> did viſit <hi>Amintor,</hi> and ſince ſhe returned ſo ill ſatisfied; and
though ſhe was very deſirous to know why <hi>Amintor</hi> ſhould ſpeake in that manner unto
her; yet ſhe durſt not goe againe ſo ſoon, leſt ſhe ſhould thereby give occaſion of ſcandal:
And now ſeeing <hi>Alcires,</hi> alſo knowing what familiarity there was betwixt them, and
not being ignorant that <hi>Alcires</hi> loved her as well as <hi>Amintor;</hi> yet ſhe could not chuſe
but aske him how he did? <hi>Alcires,</hi> ſeeming as if he did not know that his friend loved
her, did anſwer her very coldly: I believe, Madam, he is very well; for he is of late ſo jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and merry, as it is not likely he will long keep his Chamber, ſince all the Phyſitians
ſay that the cauſe of his malady was exceſſive ſorrow: I believe, ſaid <hi>Clarinta,</hi> that the
Phyſitians ſaid truly; but if he be ſo jocond as you ſay, he is much changed ſince I ſaw
him; for the laſt time I was with him, he could ſcarcely open his mouth to give me a
word. I know not, ſaid <hi>Alcires,</hi> when it was you ſaw him, but I am ſure that never
man looked with a more contented face, then he did yeſterday morning; and it was not
without good reaſon, if he who obtaines his deſires has any reaſon to be contented, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you <hi>Alcires,</hi> ſaid ſhe preſently, let me know what it is which cauſeth him ſo much
contentment, that as his Couſen and friend, I may participate in his joyes. Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
he, I ſhould willingly obey your command, but that I know very few women who
can be ſecret; and ſhould he ever come to know it, I ſhould quite loſe his friendſhip,
which I value at a very high and deare rate. I muſt confeſſe, ſaid ſhe, that I am a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but none of thoſe who you ſay cannot keep a ſecret, having ever made a conſtant
profeſſion not to ſpeak of any thing which I promiſe to conceal, as at this time I ſweare
and proteſt I will: Upon this promiſe, ſaid he, I will tell it you, but upon a condition
that you ſhall not by your ſoveraigne power over me, urge me to tell more then I am
willing to impart: I aſſure you (ſaid ſhe) that I will not: Know then, replyed <hi>Alcires,</hi>
moſt craftily, that poor <hi>Amintor</hi> is ſecretly become deſperately in love with one of the
prime and faireſt Ladies in all the Court; and loving her extreame paſſionately, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to try how her pulſe did beat in good will towards him: but finding himſelfe not
not ſo happy as in his hopes, he reſented it ſo ſadly, that he fell ſick, and fell into ſuch
ſtrange fits of melancholly, as there are very few perſons but that gheſſe her to be the onely
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53527:36"/>
cauſe of it. Of which this faire one being advertiſed, was moved unto ſo much compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
as to viſit him: and ſince finding the grandure of his affection, ſhe gave him ſo much
cauſe of contentment, as before ſhe did of deſpaire Do not expect, Madam, that I ſhould
tell you who it is, unleſſe you can gueſs at her by the effects which I ſhall relate: but ſo it
is, that this very morning he hath a writ a Letter unto her, and made me his confident to
carry it. <hi>Clarinta</hi> hearing this, and being infinitely ſurpriſed at it, ſhe could not chuſe
but bluſh extreamly; and becauſe ſhe would not have <hi>Alcires</hi> ſee her, ſhe held her Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercher
before her face, and asked him who that kind Lady was, ſtill keeping her Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercher
cloſe to her face: This is it Madam, ſaid <hi>Alcires</hi> which you promiſed not to urge
me to reveale; but to give you full aſſurance of what I ſay, though the Letter be ſealed,
yete will break it open and ſhew it unto you, then he opened it, and preſented it unto her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
She who knew it very well to be <hi>Amintors</hi> hand, as ſoone as ever ſhe caſt her eye upon it,
and therefore beleeved all that <hi>Alcires</hi> ſaid: ſhe read it with a ſtrange perturbation of
ſpirit, which ſtill made her more and more deſirous to know unto whom theſe thankes
was directed. Will you not tell me <hi>Alcires</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him) unto whom this good
language was written? Madam, ſaid he, I ſhould have named her unto you at the firſt,
had I not taken ſo deepe an oath to the contrary, as it is horror unto me to thinke of
breaking it: but let it ſuffice you that ſhe is one of the faireſt Ladies in all the Court I
beleeve it, ſaid <hi>Clarinta,</hi> ſince you ſay it: but for all her beauty, let me tell you that ſhe
is very kind: And ſince you will not tell me her name, for want of other revenge ſhe ſhall
never have the contentment of reading this Letter: Then out of ſpite, ſhe tore it in ſeverall
peeces. <hi>Alcires</hi> ſeemed to be hugely angry at this and would have hindred her, although
it was the leaſt of his cares: at laſt, ſeeing there was no remedy, he was pacified: I will
tell him, ſaid he, that as I pulled my Handkercher out of my pocket it fell into the
Fire and was burned before I ever tooke notice of it, but if he will write it, I will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
another.</p>
                     <p>Could he poſſibly uſe more ſubtilty to break of friendſhip and love on both ſides than
he did? And it had ſuch operation in them both, that <hi>Clarinta</hi> being deceived by this
Letter, and <hi>Amintor</hi> by his owne eyes, they were both ſo ill ſatisfied with each other, as
they longed for an opportunity of meeting to upbrald themſelves mutually with infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
But upon better thoughts <hi>Clarinta</hi> ſhe reſolved to ſee <hi>Amintor</hi> no more, and <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
he would not as he uſed, ſend any more to viſit her; and all this did but the more
confirme them in thoſe opinions which <hi>Alcires</hi> had infuſed into them.</p>
                     <p>Now Reverend Father, be pleaſed to obſerve how eaſily Fortune can when ſhe will,
facilitate the way unto her Favorites to bring about their deſignes. I have inſiſted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
long upon the ſubtilties of <hi>Alcires,</hi> and diſcontents of <hi>Clarinta,</hi> that you may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the better underſtand, how <hi>Alcidon</hi> to effect my requeſt unto him, came to be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with <hi>Clarinta:</hi> for it is moſt certain, that without this diſſention he had very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compaſſed his deſigne; but as he was ever happy in all his attempts, ſo he was no leſſe
in this encounter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcidon</hi> would very faine have palliated his infidelity with words; and though I
was ſilent when he ſpoke, and ſeemed the firſt time he came unto me to take no notice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing; yet I know very well that he had other affections in him than unto me; and
without going any further, I was fully informed that <hi>Thoriſmond</hi> being dead, and when
<hi>Thierry</hi> his Brother aſſumed the Crowne, then did he ſee <hi>Clarinta</hi> in one of the <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi>
Cities, and loved her; and if I would, perhaps I could tell him both the time and
the place; but it will ſuffice that his owne ſoule knowes this to be true. And becauſe <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon</hi>
ſeemed to deny what ſhe ſaid; Nay, nay, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, never deny the truth;
you know that what I ſay is true; And that a little after the accident of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donthe,
Thoriſmond</hi> dying and <hi>Thierry</hi> ſucceding him, you followed him in his Voyages,
and at the ſeige of a City, you ſaw that Lady, in whoſe ſervice you had continued longer,
if <hi>Thierry</hi> had not dyed almoſt as ſoone as he was King, and being ſince much imployed
by the great <hi>Eurick</hi> in ſeverall enterpriſes, you forgot <hi>Clarinta,</hi> as you did me. Come,
come <hi>Alcidon</hi> be content<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d; if I would, I could relate, not onely the beginning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
of this affection; but perhaps alſo ſo many particulars of your life, as will make
you amazed.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeake this, wiſe <hi>Adamas,</hi> not to upbraid his inconſtancy; for I know that his age
would not then permit him to be more conſtant; but my drift is onely to let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53527:36"/>
that it was much leſſe paines to him to make his affection knowne unto that Lady.
I do not deny, ſaid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and interrupted her, but that at the time you mention, I did
ſee <hi>Clarinta,</hi> and that her beauty did at the firſt bluſh raviſh me, by an unexpected encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
For at the ſeige of a Towne, there being an intermiſſion of Armes, I went up to the
wals to fetch off ſome Souldiers who lay a little too neere: There I eſpyed this Lady
upon the battlements, ſpeaking unto one of our Army whom ſhe knew: I muſt needs ſay,
that as ſoone as I ſaw her, I admired her, and that ſhe had then like to coſt me my life,
For the Truce being ended whilſt I was gazing upon her, I took no notice how Arrows flew
about as thicke as haileſtones, which thoſe of the Towne did ſhoot at me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I remember
her dreſſe was an embleme of death, for ſhe was then in mourning for her Father, ſo as
the ſight of her was almoſt mortall to me in that kind: but I will never confeſſe that this
did ever make me falle in my duty to you, and you doe me moſt manifeſt injury if you
ſay otherwiſe. We will beleeve what you pleaſe, ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> but <hi>Alcidon,</hi> this time
in which I commanded you to ſpeake unto her of Love was not the firſt time you ſaw her,
and therefore acceſſe was more eaſie unto you. Yet at the firſt, ſhe knowing of the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
betwixt us, becauſe the King himſelfe had told her, ſhe did much reject his addreſſe:
For you muſt know, Reverend Father, that the great <hi>Eurick</hi> deſiring to inſinuate himſelf
into her favour, did let her underſtand, that all the addreſſes which he made unto me,
were onely in the behalfe of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> whom he told her was paſſionately in love
with me.</p>
                     <p>This Cavalier being very deſirous to overcome this fair one he would not be repulſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt denial. But one day, when <hi>Eurick</hi> was walking upon the banks of <hi>Roſne,</hi> and
the better to paſſe away his time, had invited many Ladies, amongſt which <hi>Clarinta</hi> and
I were; I obſerved how <hi>Alcidon</hi> accoaſted her, and how after he had talked a while
with her, he gave a paper unto her, which ſhe tooke, and tore in peeces, and without
reading it threw it into the water. I could not then heare what he ſaid unto her, or what
ſhe anſwered, becauſe they ſpoke very low, and I was very farre off. But <hi>Alcidon</hi> told
me ſince, that he ſaid thus unto her.</p>
                     <p>Doe not thinke it ſtrange Madam, I ſhould in this place try whether I can obtaine that
which I could not in another; I meane the honour and happineſſe of your favour: For
being alwayes unfortunate, when I begged it upon the Land, I will try whether the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Water will prove more favourable unto me: And becauſe when I looked upon
you, my ſoule was ſo wholly in my eyes, as my tongue forgot its function, and I could
not ſpeake, therefore I preſent my hearts humble deſires unto you in this paper, which
I would, but cannot ſpeake: Upon this, he preſented it unto her, and ſhe fearing that
if ſhe did refuſe it, many might take notice of it, ſhe tooke it, and ſaid thus unto him:
You have reaſon <hi>Alcidon</hi> to thinke that this element will be more favourable unto you
than the other, if it be true that every thing favours its like; for your inconſtant humour
does not at all reſemble the Earth, but the Water very much, which ebbs and flowes,
and is never ſtill. And to ſhew you that I am of the ſame judgement, I will beſtow upon it
this paper, in which you ſay you have writ your deſires, to the end it may grant
your requeſts, aſſuring my ſelfe that you being as inconſtant as it, it will favour you, as
much as poſſible it can: Upon this ſhe tore the paper all in peeces, and without reading it,
threw it into the Water. Oh Madam (ſaid <hi>Alcidon</hi> to her, ſtriving to ſtay her arm) can
you thus deſpiſe the moſt pure affection that ever was offered unto you? Are you not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
unjuſt beauty that you are, to burne my heart by the flames of your eyes, but you
muſt alſo drownd all my deſires in this Water before you ſee them? You doe me wrong
replyed ſhe, in accuſing me of injuſtice, ſince I make my ſelfe appeare to be moſt equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in detaining nothing of anothers, and in rendring unto this element, which is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant,
the thoughts and conceptions of the moſt inconſtant heart in the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt this Cavalier and <hi>Clarinta</hi> were thus talking, the King was diſcourſing with
me; yet I was not ſo attentive to his talke, but ſtill I had an eye upon <hi>Alcidon,</hi> aſſuring
my ſelfe that <hi>Clarinta</hi> by ſome action or other would give me ſome light of what he ſaid;
and to the end that the King ſhould take notice of them, I fixed my eyes upon them, and
would not anſwer him: And he pulling me by my arme, as if he would wake me out
of a ſleepe: I am awake Sir, ſaid I unto him, pray ſee what I am obſerving; then I ſhewed

                        <hi>Clarinta</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and as fortune was, juſt at the ſame time when the Cavalier
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53527:37"/>
gave her the Letter, ſo as he ſaw how ſhe tore it, and threw it into the water, of which I
was very glad, to the end he might take notice of this new Love; knowing very well,
that in ſuch matters as theſe, you need onely make them ſee a little, and let jealouſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
to make up the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Since this day, <hi>Alcidon</hi> followed his enterpriſe ſo cloſe, that the faire <hi>Clarinta</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this would be a fit meanes to gaine <hi>Eurick,</hi> and to make <hi>Amintor</hi> lament the loſſe
he had of her, ſhe ſeemed to incline unto him; I ſay ſeemed, for indeed ſhe was then ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of Ambition then Love; and therefore ſhe aimed at <hi>Eurickes</hi> love, and was vexed
at <hi>Amintor,</hi> thinking he had left her for ſome other; againſt which, ſhe thought her
Carraſſe of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> might be very profitable unto her: For ſhe knew very well, that to
reduce an Apoſtate Lover, there was no better way then to make him jealous; and to get
the affection of a King, no better artifice, then firſt to get the favour of his favorites, as ſhe
knew this Cavalier to be one, to the end that they by their good words in the cure of
their maſter, might induce him unto love: beſides which, ſhe had as ſhe thought, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this in me, whom ſhe knew <hi>Alcidon</hi> favoured; and ſhe thought that I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
unto the Kings favour by this meanes. Upon theſe conſiderations therefore, ſhe
began to hearken unto this Cavalier, and to conferre ſome kind of triviall favours upon
him, of which I was very glad, thinking that when the King ſaw it, he would according
to his humour, be extreamly offended at it: and when I could talke unto <hi>Alcidon</hi> in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
I ſtill ſolicited him to engraciate himſelfe further into her favour, and to court her
as much as he could in the ſight of King <hi>Eurick,</hi> which he did ſo effectually, that not
onely the King, and <hi>Amintor,</hi> but almoſt all the Court took notice of it, though neither
<hi>Clarinta</hi> nor <hi>Alcidon,</hi> had at the firſt any aimes of making themſelves loved in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
but onely as conducing to their ſeverall deſignes, which could not be accompliſhed
had they kept their amities in ſecret; becauſe all the effects which they hoped for, was to
proceed from the knowledge which others were to have of it.</p>
                     <p>They continued thus a long while, during which, <hi>Amintor</hi> ſtill inveighed againſt the
affection which he bore unto <hi>Clarinta;</hi> his generous ſoule not being able to conſent, that
his heart ſhould ever love one, who as he thought had ſo baſely betrayed him. On the
other ſide, ſhe who thought that ſhe had more reaſon to hate him, for ſo unworthily ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
her off, although ſhe ſeemed not to care a ruſh for it, yet her ſoule was ſo extreamly
nettled with ſpite at it, as though ſhe was not able to find revenge ſo ſoon as ſhe deſired,
yet ſhe could not defend her ſelfe from extreame ſadneſſe, which in her face did diſcover
that diſcontent, which her heart would have concealed: And as a ſnow-ball growes big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for being rowled in the ſnow, ſo this her diſpleaſure being joyned unto other vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereof the life of man is very fertile, together with ſome indiſpoſition of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
ſhe was brought into ſuch a condition, as ſhe was conſtrained to keep her bed, where
all her paſtime was to ſigh and lament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amintor</hi> was preſently advertiſed of it; for by reaſon of their affinity, both their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtiques
had much familiarity together. But this was not enough to appeaſe the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſpirit of that Cavalier. It happened, that this faire one growing every day worſe and
worſe, he was told one night that ſhe was ſo very ill, as it was feared ſhe would not live
until the morning. Thus farre he had held out; but hearing talke of death, he thought
it time to render himſelfe, and therefore without more delay, he dreſſed himſelfe by force,
and though ſick, yet crawling as well as he could to the lodging of <hi>Clarinta,</hi> he found
her in bed, yet not in ſuch extremity as was reported. She who expected any viſit ſooner
then his, and who was much offended at him, could not indure his preſence without
paine, thinking that he came to ſee her onely to delude her more; and therefore ſhe row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
up her ſelfe with a reſolution to anger him as much as ſhe could: And in order to
this, after ſome common diſcourſe, ſhe asked him, what newes at Court: For, ſaid ſhe,
I keeping my bed as you ſee me, I know nothing, but what out of pitty is told me. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſaid <hi>Amintor</hi> faintly, It is ſo long ſince I was at Court, or in any place but my bed,
as you muſt not aske me for any newes: I came hither onely to ſee you, and am very glad
to find you in a better condition then I heard you were. Perhaps <hi>Amintor,</hi> anſwered ſhe,
you were in hopes to finde me dead: No, no, Sir, I will not yet put you to the expences
of mourning for me: And to ſhew that I am not, thankes be to God, in ſuch a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
I will manifeſt to you, that my thoughts are quite another way; then putting her
hand under her Pillow, ſhe pulled out a Paper which ſhe gave him; Here <hi>Amintor,</hi> reade
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53527:37"/>
theſe Lines which were writ upon thoſe Flowers which you ſee at my Beds head; &amp; if you
cannot gueſs at the Author, I will tell you who it is: Before I ever reade them, ſaid he,
I am moſt confident that I can name him; then opening the Paper, he began to read
it.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Amintor</hi> had read two or three lines, he pauſed a while: Well Sir, ſaid <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinta</hi>
unto him, what doe you thinke upon them? Hitherto, anſwered he, I find nothing
which makes me alter my opinion, except the hand, which indeed is not the ſame I
thought it; but perhaps it was writ purpoſely to delude thoſe that read it. I am ſure, ſaid
<hi>Clarinta,</hi> that you are miſtaken; but read on, and perhaps you will know better, and
your opinion will be quite confuſed. Then <hi>Amintor</hi> began to read again; and when he had
read a line or two further; I cannot tell, ſaid he, whether that which followes may alter
my opinion; but thus far I am ſtill in the ſame minde, and then he began to read out the
reſt. When he had done, he muſed, and was much gravelled to imagine who ſhould be the
Author: for at firſt he thought upon <hi>Alcires,</hi> but the concluſion put him quite out of
that conceit: <hi>Clarinta</hi> ſeeing he could not hit upon it, and ſeeming to make great eſteem
of the Paper, ſhe laid it in the place where it lay, and then turning towards him; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>Amintor,</hi> ſaid ſhe, that you cannot find out the Author; but, I aſſure you, he is a
perſon who merits as good fortune as any about the Court, I muſt confeſſe, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he, that theſe laſt lines doe put me out of my knowledge, unleſſe to diſguiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
the more, he faigns to be leſſe favoured then he is. Why <hi>Amintor,</hi> replyed <hi>Clarinta</hi>
preſently, doe you thinke me ſo liberall of my favours, as to conferre them upon any one?
this might ſerve ſuch a one unto whom you gave ſo many fine thanks; but if you have not
forgotten the way of my living with you, when you made addreſſes to me, you may
know that I am not a perſon from whom any favours are to be expected. Oh Madam,
anſwered he, and ſighed, I have but too good a memory of what you mention; But
alas, my own eyes are ſuch certaine witneſſes, that I cannot give them the lye. <hi>Clarinta</hi>
was very ill; but when ſhe heard him ſay ſo, ſhe turned in a fury towards him; what can
your eyes witneſſe, ſaid ſhe, to my diſadvantage? and becauſe out of his reſpect unto her,
he did not anſwer, ſhe continued; Nay, nay, <hi>Amintor,</hi> Never offer by your ſilence, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

eyes of all men living, can teſtifie any thing to my diſadvantage; if they doe, they are
unjuſt, and I ſhall look upon <hi>Amintor</hi> as the moſt perfidious and ungrateful man alive. If
ever I failed, Madam, ſaid he, in my honourr of fidelity which I owe unto her who accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
me of perfidy and ingratitude, I pray heavens this minute may be the laſt of my
life. But if you pleaſe, Madam, to give me leave, I will anſwer to the queſtion you asked
me. Yes, yes, ſaid ſhe in an angry manner, tell all you know; but be ſure there be more
truth in your words, then in your oathes. Madam, anſwered he, your command is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
and this is truth it ſelfe, that I would not deſire life, but to have the honour of doing
you that faithful ſervice which I have vowed: I doe impatiently deſire to heare the end
of your diſcourſe, ſaid <hi>Clarinta,</hi> that afterwards I may make you confeſſe your ſelfe to be
the moſt ungrateful perſon in the whole Univerſe; I ſhall prove it by your owne hand,
unleſſe you have the impudence to deny it: <hi>Amintor,</hi> after a while of ſilence, anſwered
thus; If you will pleaſe, Madam, to tell me what moves you to uſe ſuch bitter termes
and injuries againſt me, I will ſatisfie your deſire with a Proteſtation, that if I doe lye
in any thing I ſay, I will pray unto the Gods moſt ſeverely to puniſh me, before I ſtir
from this place: but I moſt humbly beſeech you, to let your minde be at reſt, until I
have ſpoke a little in my owne defence. When you ſhewed me the Paper, I believed the
happy <hi>Alcires</hi> to be the Author of it; but when I found in the laſt lines how he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
againſt thoſe Flowers, for enjoying the happineſſe he deſired, and of which he
was deprived; I preſently altered my opinion, unleſſe it was ſo expreſſed purpoſely to
diſguiſe the matter; for I have ſeen him enter into your Chamber ſo eaſily, that he
could have no cauſe to wiſh for more permiſſion than he had. Oh ye Gods, Cryed out
<hi>Clarinta,</hi> did you ever ſee <hi>Alcires</hi> come into my Chamber in the night? Madam, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he, I have ſeen him go in, and in the night; may the Gods never proſper me, if theſe
eyes of mine have not ſeen him do ſo: would any have thought, replyed ſhe, that <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
ſoule ſhould ever have been ſo wicked, as to juſtifie a thing ſo falſe, and to call the
Gods for a witneſſe of it? I am ſorry, Madam, replyed he, that in my obſervance of

your Commands, I ſhould be forced to a diſcourſe, which troubles you ſo much; but
moſt aſſuredly I have ſeen him goe in, and ſo ſure I am of it, that unleſſe I had entred in

that ever was invented: And oh ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

addreſſing her ſelfe to the Cavalier: it is not a time, ſaid ſhe, to diſſemble any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
I will have this villany ſearched to the bottome, and the maske of it taken quite off:
Life is not dearer to me than my honour, and death ſhall be evermore welcome to me
than this Calamny and therefore <hi>Amintor</hi> ſpeake cleerly, and tell me when, and how
you ſaw <hi>Alcires</hi> come into my Chamber, otherwiſe I ſhall beleeve that all you ſay is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
your own invention Madam, anſwered he, <hi>Alcires</hi> is the man who unhoodwinkt theſe
eyes of mine, who when I would not beleeve what he ſaid, did let me ſee the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
favours you did him, and brought me to your very Chamber door to ſee him enter,
and upon this, he related unto her the whole ſtory of the buſineſſe, both what he had ſeene,
and what had paſſed between <hi>Alcires</hi> and him.</p>
                     <p>This poore Lady was ſo aſtoniſhed at this cunning Calumny, as ſhe ſtood along time
like a Statue, and was not able to open her mouth, at laſt recollecting her ſelfe, and
rouſing up her ſpirits; is it poſſible (ſaid ſhe) that any humane wit ſhould be ſo wicked,
as you tell me <hi>Alcires</hi> is againſt me, who never gave him any cauſe? Can the clemency
of the gods be ſo great towards men, as not to chaſtiſe ſuch a damned villany? In the
firſt place, <hi>Amintor,</hi> I doe ſweare and proteſt unto you, that there is nothing in the
world more falſe than this impoſture, and may the gods poure out the higheſt of their
indignation upon me, if there be any part of this calumny true: in the ſecond place, I
conjure you by our former friendſhip, and by all thoſe promiſes of good will unto me
which you have vowed unto me, alſo by the obligation of conſanguinity betwixt us, that
you ſearch out this wickedneſſe to the very bottome, ſo as there may not remain in you
or any that heares of it, the leaſt doubt of the truth: And upon this condition and no
other, I will pardon the offence you have done me in beleeving ſuch falſe and wicked
things of me; And though I could clear the matter before you goe from hence; yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
for my ſatisfaction, that as <hi>Alcires</hi> and your owne eyes have deceived you, ſo I
would have it them that ſhould undeceive you, you ſay that he uſed to come very often
unto me: Looke, but looke well into the matter, and I am confident you will find he went
ſome whither elſe. And yet, not to leave you long in ſo bad an opinion of me, I will let
you ſee that <hi>Alcires</hi> does not manage his villany with judgement; You told me that when
he brought you to my Chamber doore, was the ſame day that <hi>Eurick</hi> condeſcended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Daphnides</hi> petition concerning a Priſoner; I doe very well remember by a remarkable
accident, that it was the fifteenth day of the Month of <hi>Mars:</hi> Now I would gladly have
you heare the teſtimony of all the ſervants in my houſe, before I ſpeake with them, to the
end you may know that God may permit innocency to be ſlandered, but not oppreſſed;
And it muſt be confeſſed, that in this God hath ſhewed a particular protection, ſince for
more than eight dayes before, and more then eight dayes after the fifteenth day of the
month of <hi>Mars,</hi> I did not lye in my Chamber, but in my Mothers, unto whom I went
every night, by reaſon of ſome indiſpoſition which ſhe had.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſo, ſaid <hi>Amintor,</hi> than the villany is cleerly diſcovered: You ſhall immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee (ſaid ſhe) that ſo it is: upon this, ſhe called for all her maids, and in the preſence
of the Cavalier asked them, how long it was ſince the laſt time ſhe lay in her Mothers
Chamber, and how many nights ſhe lay there; all of them teſtified the very ſame ſhe had
told, and did make the impoſture of <hi>Alcires</hi> ſo plaine that <hi>Amintor</hi> was put out of all
doubt.</p>
                     <p>This Cavalier hearing the concurrent Teſtimonies of ſo many, he was ſo convinced of
the truth, as he thought it abſolutely impoſſible to be otherwiſe. And when all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were retired, he ſaid thus unto <hi>Clarinta;</hi> I muſt needs confeſſe Madam, that the
impoſture of <hi>Alcires</hi> is very great, and containes two grand offences; the one againſt you,
&amp; the other againſt me; and becauſe I am ſenſible as well of my own error as his wickednes;
I moſt humbly beg a pardon for retaining ſuch an ill opinion of you, beſeeching you to
conſider how cunningly this villany hath been carried, and how true love is alwayes apt
to be jealous: When I have the happineſſe to obtaine this pardon, I ſhall then call <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
to a ſtrickt accompt for ſtaining the reputation of <hi>Clarinta</hi> and for moſt perfidiouſly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53527:38"/>
betraying his friend <hi>Amintor</hi> by his ſubtle impoſtures. <hi>Clarinta</hi> who ſtill preſerved ſome
ſparkes of good will unto this Cavalier, ſeeing him ſo ſubmiſſively upon his knees before
her, ſhe kindly tooke him up, and cauſing him to fit by her, with teares in her eyes ſaid
thus unto him. Although <hi>Amintor,</hi> the ſubtle villany of <hi>Alcires</hi> be very great and much
beyond your crime; yet let me tell you that you are farre from being blameleſſe in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuch things of me, having long before received ſo many teſtimonies from me of the
contrary: But when I conſider your affection to me, I will lay the whole load upon jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,
which is ordinary with thoſe that love, and ſo pardon the fault upon two condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
the one is, that ſince <hi>Alcires</hi> uſeth to come ſo often unto me in the night, you to
follow him, ſo as you may know whither he goes, for certainly he comes not hither; in
thus doing, perhaps you will diſcover ſome other haunts, which I ſhall be glad to know,
that I may pay him in his owne Coyne, and doe him the diſpleaſure he intended to doe
me: The other condition is, that you promiſe me not to reſent this offence too deeply
againſt him; I know your courage is apt to call him unto ſatisfaction, and this I muſt
not ſuffer, becauſe if you doe you will offend me more than he has; it would reflect much
upon me, you would thereby make all the Court know that which is now onely knowne
to your ſelfe; you know that a Calumny will blaſt a womans reputation and ſcandals
will ſpread themſelves like aire into all eares. Madam (ſaid <hi>Amintor</hi>) this laſt command
goes ſomething hardly downe; and I beſeech you conſider, that though it be not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of you, yet I am obliged to let this impoſtor know, that I am not a perſon that
can put up ſuch injuries: for reputation is ſo chairy and cautelous, as though none know
any thing, yet if we our ſelves can ſuffer any indignity without reſentment, we are not
worthy to be called perſons of honour; for a conſcience is as good as a thouſand Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.
<hi>Amintor,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him, I would have you doe this for my ſake, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
with your ſelfes, that every Cavalier is obliged at much unto the honour of Ladies
as their own; you know <hi>Amintor</hi> that you ought to have a care of mine, and ought not
to doe any thing which may give it the leaſt ſtaine. I will not inſtance by way of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon you, the affection which heretofore you have promiſed unto me; for I now
ſee, that the power I have over you is but very little. Madam, ſaid <hi>Amintor,</hi> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
her, to ſhew you that you never had more power over me than now you have, I
will do as you command me, but ſtill upon condition that you tell me, what the perfidie is
whereof you accuſe me, and whether it ariſe from ſuch another originall as that of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>
I do beleeve, ſaid ſhe, that it is poſſible to be ſo, yet your owne hand writing which
I know very well, will hardly let me thinke you innocent. Then cauſing a box to be
brought unto her, ſhe tooke out the torne paper which <hi>Alcires</hi> gave unto her, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one piece unto him, can you deny, ſaid ſhe, that this is your writing? <hi>Amintor</hi>
having looked well upon it; I muſt confeſſe, Madam, ſaid he, that this is my hand: Then
ſaid <hi>Clarinta,</hi> when all the peeces are put together, they will ſhew you the perfidie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I accuſe you; for I confeſſe the Letter was brought whole unto my hands; but when
I ſaw my ſelfe ſo baſely betrayed by a perſon from whom I leaſt expected it, very ſpite and
anger made me tear it thus in pieces. <hi>Amintor</hi> was ſo much amazed as he could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
but ſhe raiſing her ſelfe up in her bed, and ſpreading the pieces of paper upon it, ſhe
joyned them ſo together as ſhe read unto him, that thankes which he gave for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
favour which he had received. <hi>Amintor</hi> calling to memory the time when
he writ this Letter, and by what cunning he was induced to write it: I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
Madam ſaid he, that <hi>Alcires</hi> is the moſt ſubtle, crafty and pernitious man that ever
breathed; tis true I writ this Letter, and gave it unto him onely as a Copy, and without
any ſeale; and ſo he told the whole ſtory and truth of the buſineſſe: but, ſaid he, I doe
remember one thing which remains in my hands, and which confirmes, as you ſaid, that
God never fails the innocent, for that will ſhew you the truth of what I tell you and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by your permiſſion, I will ſend for a little box, in which I put the paper that <hi>Alcires</hi>
writ, when he intreated me to indite that Letter for him, according as he ſaid, the King
had commanded him. By which you may plainly ſee, that what I did was only at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and without any concernment of my owne. <hi>Clarinta</hi> had a great deſire to ſift out
the matter, and therefore deſired him to ſend for this paper which being preſently brought
did cleerly teſtifie the truth of what <hi>Amintor</hi> ſaid, which gave ſuch full ſatisfaction unto
<hi>Clarinta</hi> (for ſhe knew the hand of <hi>Alcires</hi> very well) as giving her hand unto <hi>Amintor,</hi>
I aske your pardon wronged <hi>Amintor,</hi> ſaid ſhe, for the ill opinion which I entertained of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53527:39"/>
you proteſting for the future, that no Artifice whatſoever, ſhall make me miſtruſt your
affection. Madam, anſwered <hi>Amintor,</hi> and kiſſed her hand, I ſhall place this day in my
Calender, as the happieſt I ever lived, ſince it has diſcovered two things which would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have come to light by any other meanes: The one is, That it hath let me know how
my own eyes have betrayed me: And the other is, That it hath let you ſee, how I am
ſtill your moſt faithfull ſervant. Theſe two happy encounter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

beyond my ſelfe, as I muſt confeſſe I have not words to expreſſe my thankes unto you, and
my good fortune; He would have continued, but he was prevented by the Kings coming
in, who hearing how ill this Lady was, he came to viſit her, almoſt all alone, leſt too
much company ſhould diſquiet her: and he came in upon ſuch a ſuddaine, as he ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the pieces of the Letter which were upon the bed: As for <hi>Amintor,</hi> he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
put his up; but <hi>Clarinta</hi> was ſo ſurpriſed at the Kings ſuddaine coming, and finding
that Cavalier with her, as ſhe forgot to put hers up: And the King ſpying them, laid
his hand upon them ſo quickly, as ſhe could not hinder him, and all her prayers were fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
to make him render it back again. But on the contrary, lapping it up very carefully
in his Hankercher; and after he had talked with her a while, he retired himſelfe to his
Cloſet, where putting the pieces of Paper into order, and ſaw the thankes which <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
gave her, (for he knew it to be his hand) imagine you in what a caſe he was. All
Lovers are commonly jealous, but eſpecially this King; whether it was that he loved with
great violence, or whether his generous courage could not brooke a Rivall; yet ſo it was,
that this jealouſie moved him to ſuch a hatred of this fair &amp; wiſe Lady, as he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himſelfe with telling this unto me, and ſhewing the Letter unto <hi>Amintor;</hi> but he
blazed it abroad, and made ſuch a publique matter of it, as all the Court had talke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
upon that ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve, ſage Father, how this pettiſh god, whom they call Love, is pleaſed to make
himſelfe merry with ſuch as ſerve him, I deſired to break off the amity betwixt <hi>Eurick</hi>
and <hi>Clarinta;</hi> and in order thereunto, I made uſe of <hi>Alcidons</hi> love by way of gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
and to the end I ſhould not be beholding to my own prudence, did raiſe up <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
who with a Letter which fell into the hands of the King, did doe the work for me.
The drift of <hi>Alcires,</hi> was to take off a ſervant from <hi>Clarinta,</hi> and by his ſubtilty make
her hate his Rivall, and quite contrary, the diſatisfaction of <hi>Clarinta</hi> was the cauſe of her
receiving <hi>Alcidon</hi> into her favour: And ſo <hi>Alcires,</hi> in lieu of one Rivall, found two.
<hi>Alcidon</hi> on the other ſide, who gave that Paper of Verſes unto <hi>Clarinta,</hi> in hopes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
her favour, he gave occaſion to <hi>Amintor</hi> to be reconciled unto her, and to find out
the knavery of <hi>Alcires. Alcires</hi> he got <hi>Amintor</hi> to write a Letter, with intention to
make the faire <hi>Clarinta</hi> hate him by it; and this Letter quite contrary to his aime, did
make himſelfe out of favour: But the worſt of all is, and which is the cauſe of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into this Country: I who aiming to make <hi>Clarinta</hi> loſe a ſervant, I gave her one,
and deprived my ſelfe of him, to reſigne him unto her; for <hi>Alcidon</hi> ſince that time, has
ſo wholly devoted himſelfe unto her, that he is mine onely in his tongue, and hers in
his heart. Oh the giddy and unconſtant humours of men! There is nothing in the world
will make them and their fleeting minds firm and ſtable.</p>
                     <p>But this Cavalier, having begun a Courtſhip of this Lady, by my commands, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
it according to his will; ſo as ſhe may very well boaſt, that as I took one ſervant
from her, ſhe has alſo raviſhed another from me, and with this advantage, that ſhe loved
<hi>Eurick</hi> onely out of ambition: but I did love <hi>Alcidon</hi> really and cordially: At the
firſt, I did not reſent the loſſe, becauſe I received extream contentment in being, delivered
from that inquietude which <hi>Clarinta</hi> kept me in, till of late. But I did not long enjoy
this reſt, for it ſeems the heaven is pleaſed I ſhould tread alwaies upon thornes; for I had
no ſooner enjoyed this happy victory, but I was forced to take up Armes againſt a new
enemy.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Eurick</hi> being extreamly offended at <hi>Clarinta,</hi> but for ſome great and prudent
conſiderations, durſt not make ſhew of his reſentments, he reſolved to make her repent it,
and through envy would chaſtife her, by conferring thoſe favours on another, which might
have been hers, could ſhe have been contented to be onely his. And in order to this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
whereas before time his affection was divided amongſt three; now his intention
was, to place it all, at leaſt all his favours, upon one onely Miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>I told you before, that when I deſired <hi>Alcidon</hi> to make addreſſes unto <hi>Clarinta,</hi> there
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53527:39"/>
was another Lady whoſe name was <hi>Adelonde,</hi> unto whom the King had made ſome ſigns
of goodwill. And now, in revenge upon <hi>Clarinta,</hi> he devotes himſelfe, and all his favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
addreſſes unto her; ſhe is now become his, and the Courts onely Idol; ſo as though
her extraction was much inferiour unto <hi>Clarinta's</hi> or mine, yet ſuch was his deſigne to
preferre her before us both; ſo as I muſt confeſſe I was two or three times in a mind to break
off quite with him: But <hi>Alcidon,</hi> by his wiſe advice, ſtill diſſwaded me, and in this made
me overcome both my ſelfe, the King, and her: ſo as I may well ſay, that I doe owe all
the contentments which I have ſince received, unto him, and his patience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adelonde</hi> being now raiſed above all her hopes, ſhe ſtill raiſed her pretenſions unto a
higher pitch and though all the world did thinke the favours which this great Prince
conferred upon her, to be very high, yet ſtill her deſires were higher. Theſe inſatible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
prompted her to make uſe of all wayes, juſt or unjuſt, eaſie or hard, to accompliſh
them. And therefore, when ſome of her friends adviſed her to uſe ſome charmes, thereby
to retaine the wavering minde of this Prince, ſhe hearkened unto them; Whereupon, ſhe
gave unto the Great <hi>Eurick,</hi> a bracelet of her haire, the lockets whereof were Lions, ſet
with ſtones: Theſe Lions had ſuch a quality, as whoſoever wore them about their arms,
they could love none but her. Perhaps it may not be ſtrange, that two ſuch puiſſant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as Love and Ambition, ſhould tempt her unto this Crime, had ſhe reſted here, and
not add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d a ſecond, which indeed proceeded meerly for want of judgement: But ſhe
thinking that he would preſerve them as precious Gemmes, and would weare them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually;
or at leaſt, to make him do ſo, and not give them unto another: ſhe told him,
that a very learned Druid, who had a very particular care of him and his Crown, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what wicked attempts would be againſt his life and ſtate, had made thoſe Lions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch Conſtellations, and with ſuch Art, that as long as he wore them about his Arme,
no enterpriſe of his enemies ſhould have any effect againſt him; but as often as any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
was attempted to his prejudice, theſe Lions would advertiſe him, by ſcratching his
Arm gently with their Clawes.</p>
                     <p>But ſee, ſage Father, how the Heavens doe mock at thoſe, who would compaſſe their
deſignes by unlawful meanes. That which this Lady had taken ſo much paines about, to
augment and preſerve the affection of this great Prince unto her, was it which made her
entirely loſe it: For as ſoon as ever he perceived that ſhe made uſe of Charmes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
he believed that all the inclinations he had unto her, proceeded from ſome Divels,
and not from her beauty, or any merit in her: and from that time did ſo extreamly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
her, as he would never come neere her; and when he ſpake of her, he called her his
Medea, and his Witch.</p>
                     <p>I have related this paſſage, Father, not as any way relating unto <hi>Alcidon,</hi> or me; but
onely that you may better know the humour and ſpirit of the Great <hi>Eurick,</hi> and by that
to judge whether I had not great reaſon to preſerve his good will unto me, by all manner
of prudent ſubtilty that poſſibly I could; and whether I had not as good reaſon to impoſe
this task upon <hi>Alcidor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, whatſoever I ſhall relate unto you more concerning this great Prince, will not at
all concerne the difference betwixt us; for ſince that time, we lived together as we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The King he returned unto me with all manner of ſubmiſſion and ſorrow, for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a perſon whom formerly he had loved. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>loved and courted <hi>Clarinta</hi>
before my face, never rendring unto me thoſe offices which the affection I had unto him
merited, and which by the law of Fidelity he was bound to pay, had there beene any
ſpark of that virtue in him. As for me, I bore it out as well as I could, and preſerved
the Kings favours to me with all poſſible ſolicitations: ſo as I could with truth ſay, that
amongſt all my cares, none was ſo great, as to ſee this fickle <hi>Alcidon</hi> was not aſhamed to
ſerve that Lady in my very preſence, after ſo many promiſes of affection and fidelity to
me.</p>
                     <p>But, Father, why ſhould I talke any more upon this ſubject, ſince I now muſt tell you
of this great Princes death; and tell it I muſt, ſince, I owe it unto the memory of the
greateſt and moſt generous Prince that ever raigned in <hi>Gaule.</hi> Now therefore, ſage
<hi>Adamas,</hi> that the great <hi>Eurick</hi> finding the affection of <hi>Clarinta</hi> fickle, and that of <hi>Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>londa,</hi>
full of foul practices, he thought mine onely worthy of himſelfe; for he ſaw me
keep ſuch a retired decorum in all my wayes, as he could not ſuſpect I loved any but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
unleſſe it was <hi>Alcidon,</hi> of whom he could not entertaine the leaſt ſpark of jealouſie.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53527:40"/>
But calling all my actions into his memory, and how modeſtly I had tolerated his various
affections and departures, and alſo how ſweetly I received him at his returne, he came at
length to that reſolution which I deſired, and declared that he would marry me, and make
me Queen, as well of his Dominions, as of his heart and affections. Judge, Reverend
Father, whether I and all my relations had not good reaſon to deem our ſelves fully hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py:
But alas, I find too well, that the heavens are not pleaſed to let a high happineſſe
laſt long: For when I was arrived at the very top of all my hopes, happineſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires;
when I had made all preparations of joy for the marriage, a curſed Aſſaſinate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inſpired with a helliſh ſpirit, did raviſh him from me by a fatall blow which he tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly
gave him to the heart.</p>
                     <p>Oh Heavens! Can you ſuffer ſuch a horrid villany to paſſe unpuniſhed? muſt not ſuch
a Monſter as this be made an eternall example of horrour to affright all men, if there
be any ſo unnaturally wicked from ſuch a curſed act? You may imagine in what a ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I was, when this fatall newes was brought unto me by the outcryes of the People:
For my part I am not able to tell you how I tooke it; for I did not onely loſe the uſe of
my reaſon, but alſo of my ſenſes for a long time; for every one tooke me for dead. Oh
happy had I been if it had been to; then ſhould I have buried all my ſorrows, &amp; all my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments
would have followed him to his Grave. Upon theſe words ſuch a flood of teares
flowed in her eyes, as ſhe was not able to ſpeake of a long time; which gave a ſufficient
teſtimony how deepely ſhe reſented her loſſe; but at laſt, the wind of ſeverall ſighes dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the raine of her eyes, ſhe aſſumed her ſpirit, and continued thus.</p>
                     <p>Pardon I beſeech you Father, the weakneſſe of a woman, for ſuch an occaſion might
perhaps excuſe a ſpirit of a higher temper than mine, did any reſent them ſo neer the heart
as I doe. But to paſſe over ſuch ſad remembrances which cannot chuſe but be tedious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and to fall into the diſcourſe where I digreſſed, give me leave to tell you, that
whilſt I was in the midſt of laments, and could not find any reſt or conſolation to my ſad
ſoule; this cruell <hi>Alcidon,</hi> to loaden me with more miſery, did preſently quit <hi>Clarinta</hi>
and comes impudently upon me, as if he had never let any other have a ſhare in his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I muſt confeſſe I was much amazed to ſee him without bluſh talke to me with as
much confidence as formerly; but I was more offended at him for coming upon me ſo
impudently, and never offering to aske pardon for the injury he had done me, and to
talke to me of love and affection: For nothing under the Sun offends a woman more than
after profeſſion of Love to quit her and love another. I permitted his diſcourſe a long
while and gave no anſwer: I beleeve he attributed my ſilence unto the reſentments of my
loſſe; but ſeeing he continued on, my patience could hold out no longer, and therefore
I was conſtrained to ſay thus unto him. <hi>Alcidon</hi> let me intreat you to hold your peace,
ſuch talke as this, is not now ſeaſonable betwixt us; though heretofore it was permitted,
yet now, ſince both you and I are much changed from what we were, it is not allowable.
He would have anſwered, but I gave him the ſtop, and ſaid unto him; Yes, yes, <hi>Alcidon,</hi>
both you and I are very much altered: I in this, becauſe heretofore I thought you had lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
only <hi>Daphaide,</hi> and am now aſſured of the contrary: And you in this, that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you devoted your ſelfe wholly unto me, and now the faire <hi>Clarinta</hi> onely poſſeſſeth
you, and may ſhe long and peacably enjoy her Conqueſt: I promiſe you <hi>Alcidon</hi> that
I am ſo farre from envying her happineſſe, as I will pray the Heavens it may many ages
continue: <hi>Alcidon</hi> was mightily amazed at this, and would gladly have juſtified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
but I was ſo certaine of the truth, as all his talke did rather move anger than love.
Afterwards (for at that time he ſaw me ſo angry, as he could not put in a word) I left
him in as angry a mood as I my ſelfe was: But the next morning he ſurpriſed me before
I was dreſt; and by chance <hi>Carlis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and <hi>Stiliana</hi> were then both in my Chamber, and they
being very familiar with us, neither he nor I concealed any thing from them: He fell
downe upon his knees, proteſted that he would never riſe, unleſſe I would promiſe him
to heare his Juſtification patiently, and then he would let me diſpoſe of his life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
as I pleaſed. I, who was ſufficiently loaded with misfortunes already, had no
mind to adde unto them thoſe diſpleaſures which I foreſaw, but perſiſted in my reſolution
not to hear him, knowing very well, that good wits never want good words to perſwade
what they will, eſpecially <hi>Alcidon,</hi> whoſe eloquence I was not ignorant of, but was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid

At laſt <hi>Carlis</hi> and <hi>Stiliana</hi> hearing our conteſt, they told me, that ſuch a Judge was
unjuſt as would condemne a Party before he heard him. Moſt true, my dear friends, ſaid
I unto them; but did you know as well as I, what charmes his words have whom you
would have me hear, you would adviſe me to ſtop my eares, rather than lend them unto
the inchantments of ſuch a Charmer as Serpents doe: But ſince you will have it ſo, let
me oblige you to aſſiſt me; which both promiſing they would, he roſe up, and knew ſo
well how to plead his Cauſe, as they were both abſolutely for him. And becauſe I knew
very well that all his eloquence was but oyled words and gilded language to gloze over his
excuſes, without any reality of truth, I ſo farre reſiſted him, as it was reſolved upon by
both ſides to have recourſe unto the Oracle, which returned us this anſwer.
<q>
                           <l>Upon a day, you'l ſee</l>
                           <l>A Fountaine, in Forreſt</l>
                           <l>Called Loves Veritie</l>
                           <l>Will ſet your hearts at reſt.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Anſwer, ſo obſcure and full of ambiguity, none of us knowing the Country, nor
ever ſo much as heard of the Fountaine of Loves Verity, it did much perplex us: And
<hi>Alcidon</hi> to ſhew what a great deſire he had that the truth of his affection might appeare,
he made ſuch enquiry of this Fountaine, as hearing of it, he could not reſt untill a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
unto it was reſolved upon. I muſt needs confeſſe, Father, his importunity did much
move me unto it; but one of the cheife reaſons which induced me thereunto was my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of being for a while abſent from the place where I had ſo many ſad Memorandums of
my loſſe, hoping that being farre off them, my ſorrowes would by degrees leſſen: And
unto this may be added my curioſity of ſeeing whether that Country, and thoſe who
dwelt in it were ſo happy as reports went; for wonders were told me of the places beauty,
of the ſweetneſſe of the Aire, the abundance of Rivers, full of Fiſh, and the pleaſantneſſe
of the Fields. But when I heard of the delectable lives of the Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes
of <hi>Loire,</hi> of <hi>Furant,</hi> of <hi>Argent,</hi> of <hi>Serane,</hi> but eſpecially of <hi>Lignon,</hi> I was raviſhed, and
wondered that all <hi>Europe</hi> did not go and inhabit in Forreſts. To know therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all this fame was true, I conſeuted unto this journey: and becauſe we heard that all
thoſe who are there were habited in the garbs of ſhepherds and ſhepherdeſſes, alſo deſiring
not to be knowne, we diſguiſed our ſelves in this habit, as well for the reaſons aforeſaid, as
becauſe we needed not any great train of Servants to attend us.</p>
                     <p>Thus reverend Father, you have heard, not onely a relation of our lives paſt, and of
our difference, but alſo the cauſe of our Voyage, and of our diſguiſe; we want nothing
now but your prudent direction, how we may ſee and have addreſſes unto this Fountain,
and your ſapient Counſell unto ſuch as ſtand in ſuch need of it as we doe.</p>
                     <p>Thus ended the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> leaving <hi>Adamas</hi> in a great opinion of her Prudence and
Wit; and becauſe he perceived ſhe expected his anſwer, he replyed thus. Who is it Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that hath heard of great <hi>Euricke,</hi> and amongſt the wonders of his Hiſtory does not
admire the puiſſance that the beauty of <hi>Daphnide</hi> had over his ſoule? I beleeve that <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
and <hi>Thyle</hi> have heard ſo much diſcourſe of it, as that your names are as well knowne
here as in <hi>Gaule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I muſt confeſſe that preſence which uſually does diminiſh the opinion which fame
gives of abſent perſons, does make it appeare that the opinion which I had of <hi>Daphni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
beauty and merit was much below what I find to be true: I thanke the Gods for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
my houſe ſo much as to ſee you in it, and ſhould be much more thankfull if I can
be any way ſerviceable unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, and it is without any flattery, I was never more
affected unto the ſervice of <hi>Amaſis</hi> or <hi>Galathea,</hi> then I am unto yours, and I ſhall eſteem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day happy that gives me any opportunity to ſhew the truth of this: Let alſo this my
devotion extend it ſelfe very farre unto <hi>Alcidon:</hi> And as to the Queſtion which you aske
me concerning the Oracle, I can at preſent ſay no more but this; that it is impoſſible
you ſhould receive that benefit which the Oracle promiſeth from the Fountaine, unleſſe
ſome ſtrange and even miraculous things do come to paſſe: For Madam, this Fountaine
as I told you before is indeed in this Country, and not farre from this houſe, but <hi>Clide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
and <hi>Gug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>man</hi> procured a learned Druide to inchant it, and ſet ſuch guards upon it,
as it is a thing impoſſible to attempt the ſeeing it by force: For it is perpetually watched
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53527:41"/>
by moſt fierce Animals; and ſuch Charms cannot be uncharmed, but by the death of the
moſt faithfull Male and Female Lovers in the world. What kind of Animals are they?
(ſaid <hi>Alcidon</hi>): for to teſtifie that I doe, and ever did love this faireſt Lady, I am very
willing to venture one.</p>
                     <p>If you can but finde, ſaid the Druid, and ſmiled, the moſt faithfull female, as it ſeemes
you have the male, perhaps you may with the loſſe of your life, let the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi>
ſee this Fountaine: but I believe you will hardly finde a companion; and ſince it is ſo,
I adviſe you to leave off your deſigne, and take my word that no humane wit or power
can bring it to paſſe, but this way I have told you: It is guarded by two of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
and moſt fierce Lions that ever any eye beheld, and two of the keeneſt Unicorns, which
guard the entrance into this Fountaine, whilſt the Lions go about to looke for their
prey: As for the Unicornes they fed like Horſes and Deer, upon Graſs and Leaves. But it
is moſt ſtrange, that theſe Lions, though of a fierce and keen nature, yet never offer any
harme, but unto ſuch as offer to enter into this Fountaine; in ſo much as the little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
feare them no more then they doe little Dogges; but if any doe approach neare a
hedge which growes about the Fountaine, you ſhall ſee the Lions grin with their teeth,
and their eyes ſparkle; and alſo the Unicornes prepare themſelves in ſuch a fearful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
as is moſt terrible to behold: There is no thoughts therefore of any force; but in
as much as I know that the Great <hi>Tautates</hi> is no lyer, and that by his Oracle he anſwers
you, that one day you ſhall ſee the Fountaine of Loves Verity; It is very fit methinks,
that we diſcourſe a little upon this ſubject; for Oracles are never falſe, but the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them does very often deceive us, becauſe ſometimes they muſt be underſtood accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the naturall word, and ſometimes Allegorically: To come therefore to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of this: If one ſhould take it literally, and according to the word, it might
be thought that the Inchantment of this Fountaine will quickly end, were it not for one
word, which is, <hi>One day,</hi> which methinkes intimates as much, as if it were a thing farre
off: for ſo we uſe to ſay, when we wiſh for any thing which we long for: And upon
this conſideration I ground, that the Oracle is perhaps to be underſtood in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which I thus interpret.</p>
                     <p>The proper quality of the Fountaine of Loves Verity, is to ſee whether or no one doe
truly love. Then any thing that can let us ſee the ſame thing, may upon the ſame reaſon
be ſaid in that particular, to be the Fountaine of Loves Verity; that is, working the ſame
effects which this Fountaine doth; Now Time, Perſeverance and Services, may doe the
ſame. It followes therefore, that Time, Services, and Perſeverance, is this Fountaine of
which we ſpeak. And that which induceth me unto this opinion is this word, One
day; For that denotes length of time, which gives occaſions of doing ſervice, and gives
leaſure to ſhew perſeverance. To tell you why the Oracle did Allegorically ſpeak rather
of Forreſt in particular, then of the Roman Province, ſince time may worke the ſame
effects there, as well as here, is a thing which I cannot doe: and yet ſince there cannot be
any thing ſuperfluous or defective in the Oracles which are the words of the Gods; I
thinke this Country was made choice of for two reſpects: The one, becauſe you ſhould
be farre from your own Country, where your quality, your buſineſſe, your kindred,
friends and acquaintance, may ſo diſturbe you, that the leaſt part of this time which
ſhould be imployed to bring you unto this knowledge, is imployed as the Oracle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
whereas being here free and without any conſtraint, the whole time is your own.
The other reſpect is, and I believe the greater; that heaven would have you ſojourne a
while in this Country, to the end that by obſerving the daily converſation of theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſſes, you may the better come to know the ſincerity of that
affection which <hi>Alcidon</hi> profeſſeth to you, or elſe his falſity and diſſimulation: For
whiteneſſe will beſt appeare, when black is oppoſed to it. I conclude therefore, by one
way or other, that the Oracle is to be underſtood thus: That you ought to ſtay for a
time in this Country, as well to ſee whether the inchantment will ceaſe, as to try the truth
of <hi>Alcidons</hi> affection; of which in the interim, I am in very great hopes; for it is to
be thought, that the Gods like good Phyſitians, would never apply remedies to diſeaſes
that are incurable; I meane, that had they known the anger of <hi>Daphnide</hi> would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
they would never have propounded this remedy.</p>
                     <p>Thus the ſage Druid ended his diſcourſe, and becauſe <hi>Daphnide</hi> offered to be going
away, <hi>Adamas</hi> did the like; but <hi>Alcidon</hi> ſtayed him, beſeeching him to make <hi>Daphnide</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:53527:41"/>
ſit downe againe, that he might in his preſence import a buſineſſe of ſome importance.
Then the Druid ſtaying her almoſt by force, <hi>Alcidon</hi> began thus.</p>
                     <p>He, Revernd Father, who ſaid he was cut with the ſharpeſt ſword, and being asked
what ſword, anſwered, that it was the ſword of Calumny, does thereby intimate unto
our underſtandings, that there is nothing which deeper pierceth the heart and the ſoule
then it, and which I have very often found to be moſt true in my ſelfe, ſince it ſo pleaſed
my fortune and this faire one to have it ſo; and the wounds ſmart now worſe then ever,
ſince ſhe continues her ill opinion of me, and blames me in the preſence of ſo reverend a
perſon as the wiſe <hi>Adamas.</hi> And becauſe I know that a charge untrue may paſſe for
truth, and becauſe I had rather die any way then in her ill opinion, I muſt humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, Madam, give me leave to ſpeake the truth in my own defence. Then becauſe
the Druid ſaid it was but reaſon, he continued thus:</p>
                     <q>
                        <floatingText xml:lang="unk">

                                 <p>THis faire one, ſage Father, has taken the paines to relate unto you the whole ſeries
of my miſerable fortune, and I muſt needs ſay, ſhe has done it truly, unleſſe in her
two dogmaticall opinions: I muſt needs ſay, ſhe is like unto thoſe who look through co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
Glaſſe, whoſe eyes ſee all things to be of the Iſame colour: for her minde being
poſſeſſed either with Love or Ambition, ſhe judges of all things according to thoſe Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
ſo as every thing which ſhe ſees in me, ſeems unto her to be as ſhe ſees them in her ſelf:
Alas faireſt <hi>Daphnide,</hi> it grieves me to upbraid you thus, and I wiſh I could make it falſe
with the loſſe of my blood and life: but you have teſtified that it is but, too true, both
by effects and by words: when you commanded me with ſo many proteſtations of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
to court <hi>Clarinta,</hi> what promiſes did you then make me? you have heard them,
grave Father; for ſhe has rightly related them, and the reaſons alſo why ſhe thought it
requiſite, I ſhould addreſſe my ſelfe unto <hi>Clarinta:</hi> I ſhall onely hint at them, to bring
them into your memory; If I be ruined in the opinion of <hi>Eurick,</hi> ſaid ſhe, then are you
the ſame, becauſe our two fortunes are conjunct and inſeparable. But what kind of ruine
was it ſhe menaced and meant? onely forſooth, to be baniſhed with her from the Court:
If <hi>Clarinta,</hi> ſaid ſhe, doe proſper in her deſignes, ſhe will baniſh us both the Court. Why,
<hi>Daphnide?</hi> Is it ſuch an intollerable torment, and an utter ruine, to ſpend the reſt of
your dayes with one that loves you beyond all expreſſion? Oh that your language had
been as full of truth as cunning, and that Love had as much power over you as Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
then would you never have enjoyed me to court her, who would have ruined no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in us but this idol Ambition. Nay on the contrary, ſhe would with abundance of
thankes, have been glad of the occaſion of our living together. But I beſeech you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Sir, obſerve what a fine gilded Pill ſhe gave me to ſwallow, and what a delicate
cover ſhe had to excuſe her ſetting me away from her. You cannot be ignorant, ſaid ſhe,
how liberall both Heaven and Nature hath been unto you in all excellent endowments;
If you doe court <hi>Clarinta,</hi> ſhe will be taken with them, which <hi>Eurick</hi> ſeeing, he will ſcorn
her; and ſhe will give her Selfe, and all her Ambition unto you.</p>
                                 <p>Oh Love, wilt thou not revenge ſuch poyſoning flattery? She would perſwade me,
that <hi>Clarinta</hi> would quit that ſame Ambition, which cauſeth <hi>Daphnide</hi> to reject me, and
give me unto another: but why ſhould any imagine, ſhe ſhould deſire my ſeparation from
her? Is it out of any ſecret hatred ſhe beares unto me? or becauſe ſhe thinkes me trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome?
No, no, none of theſe; but for the ſame reaſon ſhe her ſelfe alleadged. <hi>Eurick,</hi>
ſaid ſhe, ſeeing you Court her, and ſhe entertaining you, he will ſleight her and retire.
This, this, Father, was the maine end all her candid eloquence did aime at: Thus would
ſhe have ſhifted me off unto <hi>Clarinta.</hi> Well, ſhe commanded it, and I was all obedience;
but have I not great reaſon to complaine, ſince ſhe is not ſatisfied with thus deceiving me;
but ſhe muſt alſo at my returne, accuſe me of her own fault? I ſweare unto you, ſaid ſhe,
that all the paines you take in Courting her, ſhall be put upon my accompt, and I will
be your paymaſter. Is it poſſible <hi>Daphnide,</hi> you ſhould ſpeake this, and now blame me for
Courting <hi>Clarinta?</hi> Nay have I not rather reaſon to require my wages for doing your
commands as near as I could? But perhaps you ſay, that when <hi>Eurick</hi> was once out of
fancy, I ſhould have deſiſted, and as the occaſion varies, ſo ought the enterpriſe. I muſt
confeſſe, Madam, that when the cauſe ceaſeth, the effects muſt ceaſe alſo: but ſince the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53527:42"/>
King was diverted from his affection unto <hi>Clarinta,</hi> by reaſon of my addreſſe, ſo had
preſently deſiſted, why might it not well be imagined, that then his affection would have
returned: would not this laſt fault have beene worſe then the firſt? But faireſt <hi>Daphnide,</hi>
if you had a mind that I ſhould have deſiſted, why did not you command me. Could
you imagine that you had not an abſolute power over me, having had formerly ſo many
ſignall teſtimonies of it. But here comes in a very fine accuſation; As ſoone as ever <hi>Eurick</hi>
was dead (ſayes ſhe) he preſently leaves his <hi>Clarinta,</hi> and never ſo much as asking any
pardon, comes to me as impudently, as if he had never devoted himſelfe unto another.
What is it thou ever canſt doe, unfortunate <hi>Alcidon,</hi> to give a teſtimony of thy fidelity,
ſince that which in all reaſon is the greateſt evidence of it, is taken for the contrary? I
courted <hi>Clarinta</hi> by command and againſt my will: onely as <hi>Daphnide</hi> ſaid, through
reaſon of ſtate, and to the end <hi>Eurick</hi> ſhould diſguſt her: Now can it be thought ſtrange
that when <hi>Euricke</hi> is dead during this counterfeit Courtſhip, I ſhould deſiſt from it? had
I not done ſo, it might be thought I had ſome other deſigne: But ſaid ſhe, you ought to
have asked me pardon before you returned to your wonted way of converſation with me;
Good God, muſt I in lieu of payment and recompence aske pardon? And why Madam
I beſeech you, ſhould <hi>I</hi> aske it? Perhaps you will anſwer, becauſe you have courted <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinta;</hi>
but I beſeech you, did not you command it, and command it with a promiſe of
recompence? but perhaps you will ſay again, that I continued longer in the ſervice than I
ſhould have done; but why Madam, ſhould I not have continued longer ſince I
expected your commands for it.</p>
                                 <p>May not this ſame Queſtion be as well asked a Gally-ſlave, whoſe will depends upon
anothers? If one ſhould aske him why he is ſo long in that Captivity? Has he not more
reaſon to aske, why doe they keep me in it ſo long? You tell me, you are ſure I loved <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinta,</hi>
and endeavoured for particular favours: But ſuppoſe I did, and that this affection
did diſpleaſe you, can you blame any but your ſelfe for it; why did you command me to
ſerve her? Is it not an evident demonſtration, that ambition is more predominate in
you than love, and muſt you not needs confeſſe, that ſince I obeyed your command ſo
willingly, Love was more ſtrong in me than your Ambition? For all thoſe reaſons
which you alledged unto me to ſhift me off from you, was only in favour of this curſed
ambition: And if the love which you ſay I bore unto <hi>Clarinta</hi> was ſo potent in me,
why did I reject her ſervice as ſoone as poſſibly I could? Why elſe ſhould I quit
her as ſoone as ever <hi>Euricke</hi> was dead? Had <hi>Clarinta</hi> treated me worſe than
uſuall, had ſhe made any new choice, or had there beene any bad underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
her and me, then there had beene ſome cauſe to ſuſpect my returne unto you; but
ſince ſhe never gave me the leaſt ſhadow of any cauſe, what can you thinke could make
me leave her, but onely the inviolable affection which I ſtill preſerved for you? But Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
perhaps you may aske why the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> who had formerly made ſo much
affection unto me appeare both before, and during <hi>Euricks</hi> love, even to the hazard of
our Fortune and reputation, ſhould after the death of this Prince, thus change her mind
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>nto me, and give me no entertainment: For it is not likely, that a Lady ſo admirably
accompliſhed every way, and ſo full of judgment, ſhould alter her humour without ſome
occaſion. No Sir, but will you ſee her reaſon for it out of her owne words: Tis true,
that at firſt ſhe loved that Prince onely out of ambition, and as ſhe cals it Reaſon of State;
but is it ſtrange a finger ſhould be burned if It be held in the flame; nay it were rather a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
if it ſhould not, for that were againſt Nature.</p>
                                 <p>The great <hi>Eurick</hi> was doubteleſſe a Prince ſo fully adorned with all accompliſhed blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments
that allure Love, as the faire one was by degrees caught before ſhe was aware,
and in lieu of loving him, as ſhe ſaid, ſhe loved him as he deſerved: And to make this
truth evident, doe but obſerve how ſadly ſhe has reſented his loſſe even unto this day;
who can doubt but that theſe are effects and certain conſequents of a moſt reall and ardent
affection? I cannot relate the ſeverall ſad reſentments ſhe has expreſſed of his death, for
they will but open my wounds the wider: But I am ſure, ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> that you would
judge them full of extreame affection, and the bad entertainment which I have received
from her proceeds from no other cauſe, but from her love unto this Prince; and as an
umbrage of it ſhe would ſet that fault upon my ſcore, which ſhe ſhould doe upon the great
<hi>Euricks</hi> and my misfortunes. But faireſt <hi>Daphnide,</hi> though you have loved him, not as
you ſay, in reaſon of State, but in good earneſt, yet againſt whom doe you thinke you
have offended? Not againſt one who has not love enough to pardon, to forget, my even
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53527:42"/>
to quite eraſſe the offence; but it againſt <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who you know adores you; he is
ready to give you his life, and his ſoule, and not to upbraid you with the injury. Why
doe you not put forth your hand unto him, and by that action of kindneſſe ſignifie, that
none but the great <hi>Eurick</hi> could ever interpoſe betwixt you and him. It is no meane
glory unto me, that ſhe whom I love ſhould have beene adored by the greateſt Prince in
the whole Univerſe; nor will it be a little ſatisfaction unto the Ghoſt of that great Prince,
you ſhorld love <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who indeed did yeild unto him in Fortune, but excelled him
in love.</p>
                                 <p>If I ſay any thing which your owne ſoule knowes not to be moſt true, tax me with a
lie; but if you cannot deny this truth, why will you toment me any longer, and make
me doe penance for a fault which you your ſelfe have committed? Upon this, <hi>Alcidon</hi>
riſing from his ſeat, and falling downe upon his knees before the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and
taking her hand: I doe vow and ſweare, ſaid he, by this faire hand which is onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to raviſh away my heart, that I did never in my life render any homage, but unto her
that owes it, and that it is ſhe alone who has and ever ſhall have the ſole power over me.
Diſpoſe of me and of my fortune as you pleaſe, and let <hi>Daphnide</hi> be as cruell as ſhe can, yet
ſtill ſhall <hi>Alcidon</hi> love her for ever. And you reverend Father, ſaid he, and addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to the Druid; The great <hi>Tautates</hi> hath eſtabliſhed you a Judge in this Country,
why doe you not condemne this Faire one to give me that heart which ſhe hath ſo often
given me, and taken away againe? If ſhe doe accuſe me for loving any elſe, is it poſſible
ſhe ſhould know better than I my ſelfe? She affirmes I love <hi>Clarinta,</hi> I ſweare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
the contrary, why ſhould ſhe thinke to be beleeved more than I? She ſees onely my
outward actions, but I know the intentions of my heart; perhaps ſhe will ſay that I
would deceive her, and that ſhe would not deceive me; but why ſhould I deceive her;
for if I did not love her, I would not care for her affection; and if I doe love her, can
ſhe thinke that he who loves one will deceive her.</p>

be againſt any thing which you ſhall deeme fit. I doe proteſt by all that is ſacred, ſaid
<hi>Alcidon,</hi> that there is nothing in the World which can keepe me from loving and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
you; and I ſweare that I will ſo farre ſtand unto the doome of wiſe <hi>Adamas,</hi> that if
he doe ſentence the contrary, I will ſo farre obey it, as that you ſhall never be troubled
with me; and if I faile in this Oath, may all the Elements he my confuſion. Then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas,</hi>
with the gravity of a reverend old Judge, began in a Majeſticall manner to ſpeak
thus: Tell me, Madam, ſaid he, did you ever love <hi>Alcidon</hi> well. Above my life, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
ſhe; and doe you now hate him, replyed he: I hate his levity and inconſtancy,
ſaid ſhe, but not him: But ſay he be not inconſtant replyed he, nor ever loved any but
you, would you then love him ſtill, and be ſorry for charging him wrongfully? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
I ſhould, ſaid ſhe: Can you charge him with any other inconſtancy, continued the
Druid, but in this buſineſſe of <hi>Clarinta?</hi> Is not that enough, anſwered <hi>Daphnide?</hi> But
when he firſt went about to ſerve <hi>Clarinta,</hi> ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> was it not by your command,
and did he not undertake it againſt his will? I muſt needs confeſſe, ſaid ſhe, that in this
I was unwiſe, and he adiſſembler; But had he made a retreate, ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
cloſed with <hi>Clarinta</hi> againe, would you not then have blamed <hi>Alcidon</hi> for diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Commandement? I thinke I ſhould, anſwered ſhe. Hear then your dooms oh
<hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſaid the Druid; The great <hi>Tautates</hi> who made the whole world
by Love, and by Love preſerves it, would not onely have things inſenſible, ſhould be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
and linked together by the bonds of Love, but things alſo ſenſible and rationall.</p>
                     <p>From hence it is that he hath given unto the inſenſible Elements, qualities which linke
them together by ſympathy: Unto Animals he hath given love and deſire to perpetuate
their kind, and unto men reaſon, which teacheth them to love God in his Creatures, and
the Creatures in God. Now this Reaſon tels us that whatſoever is amiable ought to be
loved, according to the degrees of its goodneſſe; and ſo, whatſoever is moſt amiable,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53527:43"/>
and has moſt goodneſſe, ought to be moſt loved. Yet in as much, as we are not obliged
unto this love, untill this goodneſſe be known unto us; it followes by conſequence, that
themore any good is known, the more it ought to be loved: But ſince God hath made
every thing by love, and that the end of every thing is alwayes moſt perfect, we may
eaſily judge, that ſince all good things have Love for their end, Love is the beſt of all
things. Now knowing this goodneſſe of love, we are obliged by the Lawes of Reaſon to
eſteem it above all things; and the more it is known, the more we ought to eſteem it.
The Oracle which was given you, for compoſing your difference, makes good what I
ſay: For it is this,
<q>
                           <l>Upon a day, you'l ſee</l>
                           <l>A Fountaine, in Forreſt</l>
                           <l>Called Loves Veritie</l>
                           <l>Will ſet your hearts at reſt.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>That is, In Forreſt you ſhall come to know, that you doe really love each other, and
then your hearts will be ſet at reſt: for the Great <hi>Tautates,</hi> who gave this Oracle unto
you, knowing how religiouſly you payed what was due both unto Him and Reaſon, did
alſo know that as ſoon as you were aſſured of each others affection, you would preſently
thinke it moſt reaſonable, to love according to your merits: And therefore <hi>Daphnide,</hi>
ſince you ſee, that <hi>Alcidon</hi> does love you, (for why ſhould he ſo paſſionately deſire your
love, if he did not truly love you?) And you <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ſince you ſee the love of <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
towards you (for why ſhould ſhe be je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lous of you and <hi>Clarinta,</hi> unleſſe her love
were the Mother of her jealouſie?) I doe Ordaine, or rather, the Great <hi>Tautates</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
you, that forgetting all paſt paſſages, and without any ſtay to ſee any other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of Loves Verity, you doe preſently unite your affections, and revive your ancient
loves of each other; make it appeare that none loves better then you two, for none have
more cauſe, ſince heaven hath infuſed it into both.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, <hi>Adamas</hi> took both their hands, and joyning them together, ſaid, May this
union be happy, and eternall. It is a thing impoſſible to expreſſe the joyes of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> or
the thanks he gave unto the great Druid, but eſpecially unto <hi>Daphnide: Stiliana,</hi> and
<hi>Carlis,</hi> and <hi>Hermantes,</hi> rejoyed for <hi>Alcidons</hi> ſake; for where ever he came, he had the
happineſſe to get all mens love.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the diſpute betwixt <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> compoſed by the prudence of
the ſage <hi>Adamas.</hi> Although he conceived the meaning of the Oracle to be, That their
jealouſies of each other ſhould vaniſh by a ſight of this Fountaine; yet like a perſon of
deep apprehenſion, judging by their diſcourſe, that he ſhould doe them a better office,
and more ſutable to their will in reconciling them, he thought it fit to expound the
Oracle in this manner, and alſo to adviſe them, to ſtay in this Country a while, to the
end that if any ſuſpitions yet remained in them, and that if it pleaſed the Heavens to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charme
the Fountaine, they might there be perfectly cured of their malady.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed thus in the preſence of <hi>Adamas,</hi> the ſhepheards and ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes,
who were in the Great Chamber with <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> as ſoone as the
Collation was ended, did fall into their ſeverall diſcourſes where they left. But <hi>Alexis</hi>
and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for feare of being interrupted, did take each other by the arm, and walked to
the other end of the Chamber, which made well for <hi>Alexis,</hi> for by moving, ſhe might
the better hide the alterations in her face and better excuſe her diſorderd language. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea</hi>
who was no leſſe tranſported, to ſee ſuch a lively reſemblance of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and not
able to hide her contentment, was very glad of this convenience to talke with <hi>Alexis</hi>
walking, as well becauſe none could heare them, as becauſe ſhe might with more freedom
expreſſe the affection which ſhe bore unto her. After therefore they had walked two or
three turns, neither of them knowing well how to begin diſcourſe; <hi>Aſtrea</hi> broke ſilence
thus,</p>
                     <p>I ſhall as long as I live, Madam, obſerve this day as a Holiday, in memory of the high
favour which I have received on it in making me ſo happy as to know you, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
my moſt zealous deſires of doing you ſervice. The ſacred Misſletoe which it hath
pleaſed the Great <hi>Tautates</hi> to make grow in our Hamlet this yeare, was an Omen of the
happineſſe which we were to receive by your coming into this place; ſhewing thereby,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53527:43"/>
that the liberall hand of the great God, where it beſtowes one favour, does accompany it
with many others. The happineſſe and good fortune of it, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> is all on my
ſide, in coming hither at ſuch a ſeaſon, when this ſacred Misſletoe is to be gathered; for
that is the cauſe of my happineſſe in ſeeing you, it being one of my greateſt deſires. How,
Madam? ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> doe you thinke it your happineſſe in wronging us all, and me in
particular, by thinking we came hither onely becauſe of this ſacred Misſletoe? I will
thinke, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> as you pleaſe; but give me leave to ſay, that it is at this time the
cauſe of my happineſſe in ſeeing you; and though I had not been here, yet you would
have come to invite <hi>Adamas</hi> unto the ſacrifice of Thanks. I doe moſt ſeriouſly proteſt,
Madam, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that it is your ſelfe onely which invited me to come hither; for I
never in my life had a more earneſt deſire of any thing, than of ſeeing of you; beſeeching
you to believe, that it is not my humour to meddle with any publique matters, but I leave
them unto our wiſer Paſtors, who takes the cure of them according to their cuſtome, and
according as they thinke moſt advantagious for this Country. I ſhould be very proud of
my ſelfe, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> if I could be perſwaded of it; for it is a thing which I moſt wiſh,
and priſe above any happineſſe that ever happened unto me. But pray tell me, fair ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe,
in what place is this Misſletoe found? If the Sun would permit you to looke
out of the window, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I ſhould let you ſee it from hence. I believe, ſaid
<hi>Alexis,</hi> that the Mountain does interpoſe, if it be on that ſide; but if it do not, I believe the
heat of the day being over, we may enjoy the pleaſant proſpect of all that plaine: upon
this, opening the Window, and both looking out; after they had looked about every
way, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> began thus.</p>
                     <p>Doe you ſee, Madam, the couſe of that River which runs by the walles of <hi>Boen,</hi> as
if it did cut that plain almoſt in the middle, and empties it ſelfe into the lap of <hi>Loire;</hi>
that is the fatall and defamed River <hi>Lignon,</hi> upon which you may perceive our Hamlet
to be ſeated, oppoſite unto mount <hi>Verdan,</hi> which is a little Mountaine in forme of a
pointed Diamond, in the middle of the plaine, and which lookes like a Rock in the Sea.
If you pleaſe to caſt your eye a little upon the left hand, you may ſee the Temple of the
good Goddeſſe, a little round Temple under which runs an arme of that deteſtable <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
and a little beyond that, following ſtill that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ravinous River, you may eſpie a little
wood, and it is there where the happy Oak grows which this year bears the ſacred Misſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe.
And truly it is worthy obſervance, That, there, is the form of a Temple made out of
little Trees, pleached together moſt artificially. None knowes who made it, nor the time
when it was ſo contrived; and yet it is ſo well ordered and contrived, as whoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
it, muſt needs confeſſe him that did it a moſt admirable Artiſt. We almoſt all think,
it was the worke either of <hi>Pan,</hi> or <hi>Egipan,</hi> or ſome other Rurall God; for ſuch exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
inventions when the Author is unknown, are commonly attributed unto ſome Deity.
<hi>Alexis</hi> feemed to wonder at all this, and the better to colour her diſſimulation, ſeemed as
if ſhe could not ſee this place which was ſhewed unto her, though none knew it better
then her ſelfe but <hi>Aſtrea</hi> pulling her a little nearer, and holding out her hand to direct
<hi>Alexis</hi> unto the place where this Temple was: Doe you ſee, Madam (ſaid ſhe unto her)
that wood which growes almoſt cloſe upon the banke of the River? Caſt your eye a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
upon the left hand and you may ſee a little Meadow greener then all the reſt; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it is, becauſe the graſs of it is not ſoyled, nor any Cattel driven into it, becauſe it
hath been long ſince dedicated unto ſome Deity, as well as that little tuft of Trees which
joynes upon it. Now this little ſacred Meadow, ſeems as if it had been conſecrated as the
Court belonging unto that artificiall Temple, which ſtands amongſt thoſe Trees I think,
ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that I doe ſee the place you meane, and I doe obſerve one tree much higher
then all the reſt: Right, right, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that is the Tree which ſupports the Temple,
and to its fame, has this yeare the happineſſe to beare the ſacred Misſletoe, for which we
ought to offer a ſacrifice of Thanks. Had I ſo much wit as to relate all the rarities there,
and the Art wherewith it is made, I am ſure you would admire them: Amongſt the reſt,
I obſerved the Picture of the Goodeſſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> (for the Temple is dedicated unto her) much
different from thoſe by which they uſe to repreſent her unto us: She is pourtrayed in the
habit of a ſhepheardeſſe, with a ſheep-hook in her hand, and her flock about her: and
which is moſt admirable, all that ſee it, ſay, that ſhe reſembles me. <hi>Alexis</hi> could not
chuſe but bluſh at this, and it was happy for her none ſtood by; for it had been an eaſie
matter to ſee what alterations were in her face, and fearing leſt if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſhould acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53527:44"/>
looke towards her, ſhe ſhould perceive it, ſhe leaned upon her elbow in the win<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dow,
and covered her face with her hand, and to give her no leiſure to looke upon her
I beleeve faire Shepherdeſſe, ſaid ſhe, that he who drew the picture of that Goddeſſe in that
manner, did it with much reaſon: For <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who is the goddeſſe of Juſtice, cannot
be better repreſented, than by a ſhepherdeſſe with her ſheephooke and her flocke; both
to ſhew that in places moſt retired and rurall, the innocent and weake are by her kept in
ſafety, and to ſhew that by the meanes of Juſtice, peaee and abundance is maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men, which are two things which cannot be better repreſented, than by ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſes
and their flocks. But I doe thinke him much more judicious in giving your,
fair face unto that goddeſſe: For how could he poſſibly make choice of a better being
to repreſent a Diety, than in taking for his patterne, the moſt perfect that ever Nature
ſhewed unto us? And ſuch is your beauty, that I beleeve if that goddeſſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> would
looke upon this picture ſhe will be prouder of your features, than of her owne and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be ſuch a one as you are on the Earth than as her ſelfe is in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Praiſes, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and bluſht, are much too high for one ſo full of misfortunes
as my ſelfe; eſpecially coming from you Madam, unto whom they are much more due;
but ſuch as I am. I am moſt devoutly yours, ſo as you may diſpoſe of me as you pleaſe,
and ſpeake of me likewiſe: For I profeſſe, that I have no higher ambition than to merit
the title of your moſt devoted ſervant. Faire ſhepherdeſſe (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) would you have
me beleeve what you ſay? Madam (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi> preſently, I doe moſt earneſtly beg it,
and conjure you unto it by what you love moſt; This conjuration, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> beſides
your owne merit, has a great prevalence and muſt needs be granted; and therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your conjuration, I doe promiſe henceforward to beleeve all your expreſſions of
good will unto me, upon a condition you will never repent of it I and in exchange, I
doe oblige my ſelfe by my fidelity never to deny any thing which you ſhall aske in the
name of her whom I love beſt. Madam, replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> may I never live a minute longer
than I devote my ſelfe, my ſervices, and my life unto your ſervice. Faire Shepherdeſſe,
ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> I doe oblige my ſelfe in the ſtrongeſt tyes of fidelity to entertaine your
amity with all my heart, and will never whilſt I live faile in any duty of a perfect
friend.</p>
                     <p>Who is able to expreſſe the contentments both of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis?</hi> ſince both lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
each other better than themſelves, but that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> feared her friends would never
conſent unto her following this dear Druide unto all places whereſoever ſhe went, and but
that <hi>Alexis</hi> had an opinion ſhe ſhould loſe all theſe pretious favours if ſhe
were knowne, it had beene impoſſible for them to hide the exceſſe of their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Paris</hi> who kept himſelfe alwayes next <hi>Diana,</hi> and who could not
ſufficieetly expreſſe his high affection to her, being vexed to ſee ſo many people about
him who harkned unto what he ſaid, and deſiring to entertaine them with ſomething elſe,
he deſired <hi>Hylas</hi> to take a Lute and ſing. <hi>Hylas</hi> all complacence, did take the Lute, and
conſented unto the deſires of <hi>Paris,</hi> upon condition every one would doe the ſame, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<hi>Silvander.</hi> This ſhepherd, who had an eye alwayes upon <hi>Diana,</hi> knowing that
ſhe loved very well to hear him ſing, he tooke the Lute from <hi>Hylas,</hi> and ſung a ſong, the
ſubject of which was, that though he loved extreamly, yet he thought he loved not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Silvander</hi> had done, he kiſſed the Lute and preſented it unto <hi>Corilas,</hi> who
willingly accepted of it, and fixing his eye upon <hi>Stella,</hi> he began to ſing upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that Now his Love was extinguiſhed, it could never kindle againe. <hi>Stella</hi> hearing
how <hi>Corilas</hi> twitted her, ſhe offered to take the Lute, intending to pay him backe the
money which he lent, but the ſhepherd doubting it he would not let her have it: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was unreaſonable that <hi>Hylas</hi> who firſt had it, ſhould be ſo long without it: Be
not offended ſhepherdeſſe, ſaid <hi>Corilas</hi> unto <hi>Stella,</hi> if I doe give it unto <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſince if your
deſigne was to expreſſe any thing of your humour, I aſſure my ſelfe he will ſatisfie you,
if he ſing according to the dictates of his heart: You are very kind <hi>Corilas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>
unto him, to pay your debts with anothers money; at the leaſt, <hi>Stella</hi> and I have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that being both of one opinion, we have met with one that will allow of our
humours, but yours is ſo bad, that you are ſingular in your Sect, then taking the Lute,
and not ſtaying for the anſwer of <hi>Corilas,</hi> he ſung in commendation of inconſtancy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:53527:44"/>
                        <hi>Phillis,</hi> who could not indure that <hi>Hylas</hi> ſhould paſſe without an anſwer, Methinks
<hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid ſhe, that both you and I are obliged to anſwer this inconſtant ſhepherd,
ſince he is ſo imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> as to ſpeake thus in the preſence of our Miſtreſſe; for every right
Lover when he heares any thing in diſadvantage of fidelity is obliged to defend that vertue.
Moſt true, my Enemy, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> and I ſhould have done it ere now, but that
I was affraid my indiſcretion would have beene blamed for interrupting, yet if <hi>Hylas</hi>
will repeat the ſame Verſes he ſung, I will try whether I can anſwer them Verſe by Verſe;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>haps ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> it will not pleaſe the Company to repeat what I have ſung already;
but, <hi>Silvander,</hi> that you may be without excuſe, I pray anſwer theſe: I am ready, ſaid
<hi>Silvander;</hi> for being ſure I have reaſon on my ſide, I am very couragious to undertake
the Combate. As the generous Lyon, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> contemnes all creatures that are his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours
in ſtrength; ſo doe I you, <hi>Silvander,</hi> being ſo much my inferiour both in wit,
and goodneſſe of cauſe; thus they began to ſing, one for, and the other againſt
inconſtancy.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe two ſhepherds were thus ſinging, and the reſt of the Company attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hearing, <hi>Paris</hi> cloſed with this opportunity, and got neerer <hi>Diana;</hi> was there ever
ſuch a pleaſant humour (ſaid he unto her in a low voice) as this of <hi>Hylas?</hi> I thinke (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the ſhepherdeſſe) that he is like all other men, onely he is a little more free and
open in uttering his thoughts than others are. Oh Madam, replyed <hi>Paris,</hi> have you ſuch
a bad opinion of men, and thinke them all as inconſtant as he is? I have no bad opinion
of men, (anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſmiled) for I cannot thinke it an errour in them to doe as
<hi>Hylas</hi> doth, ſince it is a thing very naturall, to love where we like beſt: And ſince moſt
ſhepherds doe love onely to pleaſe themſelves, have I not good cauſe to thinke that where
they find moſt pleaſure, there they will without any difficulty love, imitating in this
our ſheep, who uſe not to eat alwayes of the ſame graſſe, nor feed only in one Paſture, but
loving variety, graze ſometimes in the Meadowes, other times upon Hils, and ſometimes
again under Shades: The ſhepherdeſſe as ſhe ſpoke this, ſmiled, to ſhew ſhe ſpoke againſt
her conſcience, and <hi>Paris</hi> taking notice of it, anſwered thus: <hi>Hylas</hi> would be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in his opinion, faireſt ſhepherdeſſe, if he heard you; but I beleeve if you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to follow this opinion, it would be ſomewhat difficult to make you conſent unto
it. I muſt confeſſe, anſwered ſhe, that what you ſay is true, for ſhepherdeſſes are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto the ſame Laws which ſhepherds are; for they doe not only fly inconſtancy, but
conſtancy alſo. This is too enigmaticall for me to underſtand, replyed <hi>Paris,</hi> unleſſe Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
you be pleaſed to make a cleerer interpretation. My meaning is, anſwered ſhe, that
the Virgins of this Country, doe not only fly inconſtancy, becauſe they are not of a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
temper; but they fly conſtancy alſo, becauſe they will not be obliged unto any kind
of amity, loving and eſteeming all that deſerve it, not with love and paſſion, but according
to duty and reaſon.</p>
                     <p>I doe beleeve it, anſwered <hi>Paris</hi> faintly: but for ſome intereſt which I may have I wiſh
that one amongſt them were of another humor. Generous <hi>Paris,</hi> replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> you
muſt needs pardon their dull capacities: for being brought up, in rurall and halfe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
places, you cannot expect they ſhould differ much from ſuch as they moſt converſe
with: you ſee what an influence education hath upon people, and above reaſon: for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
there is very few in all this company, who would not more contentedly chuſe to live
with their flockes upon the bankes of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and under their homely roofes, than in
princely Pallaces, and civilized Cities. I beſeech you faireſt ſhepherdeſſe ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> what
opinion are you off, what doe you thinke of this houſe? and how ſuits it with your lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
I ſhould ſhew my ſelfe of a very weake judgment, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> if I did not
thinke it very noble, and very pleaſant. Much more noble and pleaſant would it be, ſaid
<hi>Paris,</hi> if what is now in it, would be alwayes in it. Tis true, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> for ſo
many faire ſhepherdeſſes and hanſome ſhepherds, doe not onely make the company very
great, but alſo the place very pleaſant. It is not the quantity, replyed <hi>Paris,</hi> but the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of perſons which makes me eſteem it: I am of your beliefe, ſaid ſhe; for moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
does commonly moſt of all make one weary of it; but they muſt be of a very bad
humour that doe diſlike the company which is here. I perceive, replyed <hi>Paris,</hi> that you
will not underſtand my meaning; for it is not of all the company which I ſpeake, but it
is, faireſt ſhepherdeſſe of one only, without which one, all the reſt of the company would
be weariſome unto me. <hi>Diana</hi> faigning not to underſtand him: That one (ſaid ſhe very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53527:45"/>

if I tell you, that you wrong me; ſince from the firſt day that I gave my ſelfe unto you, the
gift was with ſo full a conſent of my heart, as I ſhall never enjoy any contentment untill
you have taken full poſſeſſion of it; and it was of you I ſpoke when I mention'd one, from
whom I muſt receive my full contentment. I ſhould be very unworthy (anſwered the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe,
and bluſht) if I did not receive this honour you are pleaſed to doe unto me, with
much obligation unto your civility: Nay, nay, ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> never tell me of any civility or
reſpect, but in lieu of thoſe words, put in that word of Love. That word, ſaid ſhe, fals
not handſomely from the tongue of a woman; If it will not come off your tongue, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                        <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Hylas</hi> had now done ſinging, and there was not a word amongſt all
the company, as if they were in hopes of their beginning to ſing againe, which was a
cauſe that many perceived not onely the affection wherewith <hi>Paris</hi> ſpoke unto <hi>Diana;</hi>
but alſo the paſſion in which <hi>Silvander</hi> was to ſee their long diſcourſe; which <hi>Hylas</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
and thinking to get ſome advantage over him: Come, come <hi>Silvander</hi> (ſaid he)
we have ſung enough; let us now be a little ſerious and rationall if we can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tell me
upon your faith whether you perſiſt ſtill in the ſame opinion which you were wont to be:
I am not much addicted unto changing (ſaid <hi>Silvander</hi>) but of what opinion doe you
meane? Are you ſtill in the heart of <hi>Diana,</hi> replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> and is ſhe ſtill in yours?
why doe you aske me this queſtion, ſaid <hi>Silvander?</hi> Becauſe (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) I will at this
time make you confeſſe the contrary. Methinkes <hi>Hylas,</hi> anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> you had
better have ſlept on then wake to no purpoſe: Whilſt every one laughed at this queſtion
and this anſwer, <hi>Phillis</hi> tooke an occaſion to interrupt the diſcourſe of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi>
and to call her companion to heare this fine diſpute: In the meane time <hi>Hylas</hi> anſwered;
ſhepherd, ſhepherd, I doe not wake to ſo little purpoſe as you thinke, ſince to put one out
of an errour, is a worke never out of ſeaſon, but anſwer me; Are you ſtill in the heart of
<hi>Diana,</hi> and is <hi>Diana</hi> in yours. <hi>Diana</hi> hearing this queſtion; Hearken (ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>)
what <hi>Hylas</hi> ſayes: For I am confident it will be ſome mad piece of diſcourſe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Then they heard <hi>Silvander</hi> anſwer thus; Doe you thinke <hi>Hylas</hi> that becauſe
you are continually changing, others are the like: <hi>Diana</hi> and I are in the very ſame pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we were wont to be; Why then, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſhe is in your heart, and you in hers. It
is as you ſay, anſwered <hi>Silvander:</hi> Then, prethee good <hi>Silvander</hi> tell me, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi>
ſince you are in the heart of <hi>Diana,</hi> whether the diſcourſe which <hi>Paris</hi> had now with
her did pleaſe her or no? And <hi>Diana,</hi> ſince you are in <hi>Silvanders</hi> heart, tell us whether
<hi>Silvander</hi> was pleaſed at the Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>There was none in all the company, except <hi>Silvander,</hi> who did not laugh ſo loud,
as they cauſed <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> to turne about and ſee what the matter was; which
<hi>Hylas</hi> obſerving, he ſtayed not for <hi>Silvanders</hi> anſwer (for <hi>Aſtreas</hi> long diſcourſe was
as vexatious unto him, as that of <hi>Paris</hi> was unto <hi>Silvander</hi>) but ran preſently to her;
Miſtreſſe, ſaid he unto <hi>Alexis,</hi> Theſe ſhepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon</hi> are ſuch bewitching flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
that unleſſe one take very good heed, it is almoſt impoſſible to reſiſt their charms.
I beleeve Servant (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) that you ſpeake like a very knowing man. Tis true
(ſaid he) I have not been ſo long Apprentice, but I have learned my Trade; For before I
loved <hi>Phillis,</hi> I thought <hi>Laonice</hi> faire, and before her, <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and before them both,
<hi>Criſide:</hi> Here is three ſtrangers, ſaid he, pointing at <hi>Florice, Palanice,</hi> and <hi>Circenea,</hi>
can witneſſe I am no Noviſt, when I was Servant unto them; and if <hi>Carlis,</hi> who is in the
Gallery with <hi>Daphnide</hi> were here, ſhe could tell you how ſhe was the firſt who taught
me my Primer. But Servant, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> I doe not thinke that <hi>Carlis</hi> can boaſt that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53527:45"/>
you hold her for your laſt Miſtreſſe, as you did for your firſt: for I have heard you ſay,
that you have loved but as many as you have met. Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, you ſhould have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as many faire ones, as I have met: for I doe confeſſe, that whereſoever my eye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
beauty, I was a lover and ſervant of it; and methinks you ſhould like my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
very well, ſince it hath made me yours; and without which, ill-favoured <hi>Carlis</hi> had
ſtill poſſeſſed me.</p>
                     <p>I like your humour extreamly well, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> did I not feare that as it is now
the cauſe of your being mine, ſo it will hereafter make me grieve for the loſſe of you.
Oh faireſt Miſtreſſe, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I beſeech you not to thinke any ſuch thing; for beſides
your offence unto my love, it is moſt impoſſible any ſuch thing ſhould ever be; for I never
loved any thing but beauty, and out of you it is moſt impoſſible to find it. I ſhould be
very glad, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> to have you continue long in this opinion of me, that I may
not loſe as others have; but I had rather that all your perſwaſions could make me believe
all you ſay of me to be true. I need no perſwaſions, anſwered he, where every eye is able
to teſtifie. If all did ſee me with your eyes, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> their teſtimonies might
perhaps be favourable unto me. I am certaine, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> that there is none here,
will give my eyes the lie. Your eyes indeed may ſee things as they are, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi>
but your mouth may perhaps be given a little to Hyperbolize, and your tongue which
is ſo glib in attributing unto me, more then is my due, does teſtifie that you have learned
in more Schools then one. I doe confeſſe it, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> but withall I am able, and
without vanity to ſpeak it, that the Schollar, ſurpaſſed the Maſter. You never told me
(ſaid <hi>Florice</hi>) that when you were my Schollar, you learned your leſſon of <hi>Circenea,</hi>
and <hi>Palinice</hi> alſo. And had we all three united our learning together, we might have
kept you longer at School. How ſervant, replyed <hi>Alexis,</hi> what? ſerve three at one time?
You may judge by that Miſtreſſe (ſaid he) the greatneſſe of my courage, and whether
I doe not ſerve you moſt devoutly, ſince I attempt none but you alone.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt he was talking thus, <hi>Adamas, Daphnide,</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> came out of the Gallery,
becauſe it was near ſupper time; and when they had talked awhile upon ſeverall ſubjects,
the table was furniſhed, and with ſuch and ſo many delicacies, as <hi>Daphnide</hi> admired that
a country houſe could find out ſuch varieties of curioſities as this wiſe Druid had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Supper being ended, and after much and various diſcourſe which laſted long, <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
obſerved by the eyes of moſt in the company, that it was bed-time; and therefore he
invited <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> unto their reſt, waiting upon them to their Chambers, and
leaving <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> to carry the reſt of the ſhepheardeſſes and ſhepheards into theirs:
but though the night was farre ſpent, yet <hi>Alexis</hi> having carried <hi>Aſtrea, Phillis,</hi> and
<hi>Diana</hi> into their Chambers, ſhe could not ſo ſoon part from them; but, after a hundred
good nights, ſtill ſhe had ſomething to ſay: At laſt, <hi>Leonide</hi> having lodged all the reſt,
came into the Chamber, and hearing the clock ſtrike midnight, ſhe conſtrained her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
The three ſhepheardeſſes being now alone, although there was ſeverall beds in the
Chamber, yet would they needs lie all together.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt they were addreſſing themſelves, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> could not for her life talke of any thing
elſe but <hi>Alexis.</hi> Siſter, ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> was ever two faces ſo full of reſemblance,
as this of the faire <hi>Alexis,</hi> and that of poor <hi>Celadon?</hi> For my part, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in my life ſaw two more like. Nay more, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> did you ever ſee any Glaſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
a nearer ſimilitude, betwixt the ſubſtance and the reflection? Nay ſiſter, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea,</hi>
what would you ſay if you had ſpoken with her in particular as I did? her voyce,
her pronunciation, her aire, her actions, her ſmiles, nay every little feature are ſo reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blant,
as if <hi>Celadon</hi> were by her, I could finde no difference; and the more I conſider
it, the more I am raviſhed with admiration. I wiſh with all my heart, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi>
we could perſwade <hi>Adamas</hi> to let her ſtay amongſt us for a time; and if we could, ſiſter,
I believe you would be well contented. Doubtleſſe I ſhould, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for I can
truly ſay, that ſince the death of poor <hi>Celadon,</hi> I never enjoyed any pleaſure but in the
ſight of <hi>Alexis.</hi> But alas, there is no hopes that <hi>Adamas</hi> will ever ſuffer her to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, for ſhe is ſo dear unto him, as he cannot ſuffer her to be out of his ſight, nor would
it be pleaſing unto her, being accuſtomed unto another kind of life: And fortune is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ſo little my friend, as I cannot thinke ſhe will ever doe me ſo great a kindneſſe. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> If you deſire that this faire one ſhould come into our Hamlet, we
muſt uſe a little cunning; ſometimes one ſhall bring that to paſſe by ſubtilty, which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53527:46"/>
would be denyed; if it were openly asked; and ſuch kind of policy is not blameable when
it will not hurt any one. Should we aske this favour of the Druid, perhaps his civility
would be ſo great as not to deny it; and perhaps alſo, he would alleadge ſuch conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as we ſhould not ſpeed: but let us goe another way to worke; let us entreat
him, and let all the company do the like, that he would be pleaſed not to retard the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of thanks for the ſacred Misſletoe: he hath already promiſed as much unto other
ſhepheards, who came with the ſame Petition: If we bring him to that paſſe, as to come
preſently with us, I am confident he will bring <hi>Alexis</hi> with him, as well becauſe <hi>Leonide</hi>
will come, as to accompany <hi>Daphnide,</hi> whom we muſt entreat to aſſiſt us in the buſineſſe:
Beſides, the ſacrifice being a buſineſſe of great and religious ſolemnity; and <hi>Alexis</hi> being
a Druid, it is not likely ſhe ſhould be left at home. Yet to be every way prepared; if it
happen ſo that <hi>Adamas</hi> do make any difficulty in it, we muſt intreat both her and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
good will unto it; for I do percieve that ſhe is not diſpleaſed to be in our company;
and yet truly conſidering the difference in education, perhaps ſhe does onely conſtrain her
ſelf out of civility to be ſo complaiſant unto us in her Fathers houſe. But for all that, I
am fully perſwaded, if we could once get her into our Hamlet, we three ſhould keep her
in it, by endeavouring to pleaſe her in ſuch things as ſhe takes moſt delight in; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
when ſhe ſees the honeſt innocency of our lives, ſhe will not thinke it much diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to her humour Truly, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and ſhook her head, ſhe is of a ſtrange tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
if we did diſpleaſe her; but I lay my life, that we ſhall all cry when ſhe is conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to leave us, and therefore we had as good let it alone <hi>Aſtrea</hi> hearing this, ſaid unto
her; Siſter, if you take any delight in my company, let us procure her to be amongſt us,
for otherwiſe I am but a meer loſt woman. But will you know what I foreſee? (ſaid
<hi>Phillis</hi>) I make no queſtion but we ſhall get her amongſt us, by the meanes which <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
hath propoſed; nor doe I feare but <hi>Alexis</hi> will be well pleaſed with us, if I doe but
take the paines to humour her; but I plainly ſee that when ſhe comes, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> will quite
leave us, and make no more reckoning of us then as meer ſtrangers. And therefore I will
tell you what we will doe if that happen: This <hi>Alexis</hi> will not ſtay alwayes with us,
but will one day return either to <hi>Dreux</hi> or to <hi>Carnutes,</hi> and then we will make no more
reckoning of her, then ſhe does of us. Fie, fie, Siſter replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I cannot abide you
ſhould bring this ſad ſeparation into memory; for Gods ſake, let us not bring on a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
by the thought of it, which will come but too ſoon of it ſelfe. No, no, replyed <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
let us lay aſide all ſuch Cogitations, and doe what our amity commands us: ſince
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> has no contentment but in this, let us doe all we can to continue it to her: And
though ſhe ſhould doe as you ſay, yet if we doe love her, we ſhould be ſorry for her, ſince
all things are common amongſt thoſe that love one another and loving her as we do, why
ſhould we not ſhare with her in the contenment which ſhe receives?</p>
                     <p>With ſuch diſcourſe as this, theſe ſhepheardeſſes got to bed, and after good nights un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one another, they fell aſleep in this reſolution which they had fixed upon. But on the
other ſide, <hi>Alexis</hi> being retired into her Chamber, and <hi>Leonide</hi> with her, <hi>Adamas</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
preſently after them, who having brought <hi>Alcidon</hi> and the old Paſtors into their
Chambers, leaving the care of the reſt unto <hi>Paris;</hi> He came unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> to know what
had paſſed betwixt him and <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> After he had ſhut the door, leſt any ſhould heare,
Well <hi>Alexis</hi> (ſaid he and ſmiled) how does <hi>Celadon?</hi> As for <hi>Celadon,</hi> anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi>
I cannot tell how he does; but as for <hi>Alexis,</hi> let me proteſt unto you, ſhe ſayes that ſhe
never in her life had more contentment ſince ſhe was your Daughter. I am glad on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, ſayes
<hi>Adamas,</hi> ſo it continue. But tell me truly, <hi>Celadon,</hi> Doe you now repent of your believing
me? It is a thing impoſſible, anſwered the ſhepheard, that any ſhould repent following
your counſell. For all you give is good, But let me tell you Father, that this which I
have received from you upon this occaſion, is full of danger unto me; for if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſhould
come to know me. I proteſt there is nothing under the Sun could keep me alive; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the juſt occaſion which I ſhould give her to blame me, for diſobeying her command,
I ſhould grieve ſo exceſſively for failing in my duty, as it would ſuffice to take away my
life; or if it did not, I would court all inventions in the world to give me a ſuddaine and
cruell death. Well, well, ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> I perceive your condition is not yet in a fit tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to take thoſe remedies which I would give you, we muſt ſtay till time has a little
more prepared your conſtitution; in the mean time, be ſure you put on a ſtrong reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not to diſobey any thing I ſhall command, for otherwiſe you will give me occaſion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53527:46"/>
to tax you with ingratitude. Father, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> I will never faile in my obedience to
you, provided your commands do not contradict thoſe which I have already received,
which is moſt impoſſible I ſhould not obſerve: I will never adviſe you (ſaid the Druid)
againſt what you ſay: But let me tell you, that the patient muſt not think, he knows
what Phyſick is better againſt his diſeaſe, then the Phyſitian doth.</p>
                     <p>To morrow, I will go in the company of theſe ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſſes, to offer
the ſacrifice of thankes for the ſalubrious Misſletoe which is found in their Hamlet; and
as it fortunes, under the very ſame Oak where you made the Temple of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> which
let me tell you, is an Onch of very good fortune to you. And becauſe I muſt according
to cuſtome, carry <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Leonide</hi> with me, it is requiſite I ſhould carry you alſo. Oh
Father, (ſaid <hi>Alcidon</hi>) what do you mean? into how much danger would you bring
both me, and your ſelfe alſo? Since it hath pleaſed good <hi>Tharamis</hi> to give me the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
of ſeeing this ſhepheardeſſe, of talking with her, and yet not to be known by
any in the company; doe not put me and yourſelfe unto any further hazard: what a
wound would it be unto your unſtained reputation, if it ſhould come to be diſcovered?
and to me it would be moſt certaine death. Let us thank the God for the favour he hath
done us; and let me rather retire into ſome deſart, where I may end my miſerable dayes.
I ſee, replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> that you are to begin again your firſt leſſon: That God whom
you name, hath commanded me to have a particular care of you, and I muſt be obedient.
For, Child, you muſt know, that he never commands any thing, but what is juſt and
laudable: and though humane ignorance does ſometimes thinke the contrary, yet in the
end we ſee, that he who keeps cloſe unto his Ordinances, does ſurmount all difficulties,
and clear all thoſe triviall doubts which may obſcure the glory of his actions. Therefore,
never trouble your ſelfe with any thing that relates unto me, no nor what returnes unto
your ſelfe; for <hi>Thamires</hi> never undertakes a thing, which he does not bring unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
end: It is he, who by me does that which you ſee me doe for your good, having
commanded me by his Oracle. Doubt not therefore, but that both You and I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
contentment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Celadon</hi> would have replyed: bnt <hi>Leonide</hi> interrupted him, ſaying, You may ſee,
ſhepheard, that oftentimes one will do thoſe things for another, which he would not doe
for himſelfe: If <hi>Adamas</hi> ſhould leave you at home, and carry with him <hi>Paris</hi> and me,
what would be thought of you? what ſtrange opinions would there be, if you who goes
under the notion of Druid, ſhould not come unto a ſacrifice of ſuch ſolemnitie; ſince
you have gone ſo far, you muſt go farther; and ſince <hi>Tautates</hi> hath committed you unto
the tuitiod of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and you your ſelfe confented to it, you cannot make a retreat
without offence both againſt that God, and <hi>Adamas</hi> alſo. You muſt ſhut your eyes againſt
all conſiderations whatſoever, and ſubmit your ſelfe wholly unto his prudence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Celadon</hi> ſhaked his head at this: Father, ſaid he, ſince the Gods have commanded it,
and ſince you are pleaſed to take it upon you, I refer my ſelfe, my life, and all my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unto you. Upon this, the Druid embraced him, and taking <hi>Leonide</hi> by the hand,
left him to his reſt. But his thoughts would not permit him to take any, for all the night
long his minde ran upon the ſweet diſcourſe which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and he had, and upon every
circumſtance, not forgetting a ſyllable, or the leaſt action which gave him any teſtimony
that ſtill ſhe loved the memory of <hi>Celadou.</hi> And when he had long entertained theſe
thoughts, he would gladly have driven them out of his mind, as thinking them contrary
to his preſent condition.</p>
                     <p>Fie, fie, miſerable ſhepheard (ſaid he) why doſt thou ſuffer thy ſelfe to be flattered up
with the ſmiles of fortune? haſt thou not often found, that ſhe never Caraſſes, but with a
deſigne of deceiving? nor raiſeth thee up, but that thy fall may be the greater? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to what a height of happineſſe thou wert once elevated; remember that never any
ſhepheard could call himſelfe ſo bleſſed as thy ſelfe: Then turne but thine eye upon the
preſent condition, and tell me if it was poſſible to fall from a ſteeper Precipice. And now
at this time, when under a ſhadow thou art taken for another, and under a borrowed
Name much off: Canſt thou take theſe favours as thine owne? thou doſt not conſider
that thou ſtealeſt them under the umbrage of anothers Name, and that they would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
unto thine.</p>
                     <p>This conſideration did make all his firſt thoughts ſo bitter unto him, as he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53527:47"/>
ready to fall into the ſame deſpaire as when he lived in his Cave, and he wanted but
a little of reſolving to returne into his firſt deſign of ſeparating himſelfe from the World,
ſince he ſaw no hopes of any cure for his miſeries. And probably this reſolution had
prompted him to put his deſigne in execution, had not ſome good Angell brought into his
memory the ſapient advice of ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> apprehending that if God had not deſigned
him ſome ſolace in his miſery, he would never have put him into the hands of ſuch a
reverend Perſon, who was eſteemed highly good and wiſe amongſt all that knew him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had toſſed away moſt of the night in theſe turbulent thoughts, this comfortable
conſideration laid him aſleepe; and it being breake of day before he began, it was long
before he awaked. <hi>Aſtrea, Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> did not the like; for <hi>Aſtrea</hi> paſſionately
deſiring to get <hi>Alexis</hi> unto her Hamlet, ſhe waked betimes: And <hi>Diana</hi> fearing leaſt
<hi>Paris</hi> ſhould find her in bed, although he carried himſelfe at a reſpective diſtance, yet ſhe
would not put it to the hazard, but as ſoone as ſhe ſaw <hi>Aſtrea</hi> wake, ſhe awaked <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
and began to upbraid her; what Servant, ſaid ſhe, are you not aſhamed to be aſleep
and your Miſtreſſe awake? Miſtreſſe, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I did not know you to be awake, but

Servant, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> let <hi>Silvander</hi> be where he is, he does not thinke upon us, and let us
thinke no more of him. As well as I love you, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> I would not be tyed to
thinke upon you ſo much as he does.</p>
                     <p>This is a bad opinion which you have of him, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> but you ſhall ſee that
when I have given my judgement, which will be within this two or three dayes, he will
preſently turne to his old byas. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> doe you really, and upon your faith,
thinke as you ſay? When you aske me upon my faith, ſaid ſhe, I muſt conſider a little
better before I anſwer; but if you will know what I would have him doe, I will tell you,
and truly; that I doe love him ſo well and my ſelfe alſo, as for both our quiers I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I ſay. Upon my faith (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> and ſmiled) you doe lye; and pardon me Miſtreſſe
if this offend you, for there was never any woman yet that was angry for being loved
and ſerved by a perſon of merit; but on the contrary, I have ſeen many very angry with
thoſe that did love them, and afterwards did fall off from loving, though they had no
deſigne upon them. Nay, I will goe a little further; I never in my life ſaw any who were
not inwardly angry at ſuch changes: I my ſelfe who never did love <hi>Hylas,</hi> yet muſt needs
confeſſe that when he quitted me, I was angry at him though I carried it as well as I could:
and the reaſon of all this is, becauſe as the addr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſſes of thoſe who love us are arguments of
our beauty and merit; ſo their departures from us are arguments of the contrary. You may
thinke of me as you pleaſe, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> but I proteſt that if it were in my choice whether
he ſhould continue, or give over his addreſſe unto me, I doe foreſee that they would both
be ſo troubleſome unto us both, as I know not which I ſhould chuſe: For if he doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it what deſigne can I have in ſuffering it? For it is not probable my Parents would
ever ſuffer me to marry a perſon who is unknowne, and I my ſelfe ſhould be aſhamed that
<hi>Diana</hi> ſhould ever commit ſuch a fault. Then againe, if we ſhould breake off all amity,
I aſſure you that I ſhould long lament it, becauſe I thinke his merits make him worthy of
Love: It is the greateſt folly in the World (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>) that Parents ſhould make mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
and we are very fooles to let them. Has not this brought <hi>Aſtrea</hi> into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
wherein ſhe is; had her Parents left her to the free diſpoſition of her ſelfe, ſhe had
married <hi>Celadon;</hi> he had been alive, and ſhe for ever contented; whereas, on the contrary,
Parents croſſing them has killed the one, and the other is little better. And now, the old
foole <hi>Phocion</hi> would beſtow her upon <hi>Calidon,</hi> and is ſo perſwaded to bring it about that
he never reſts. Ah that I had the hampering of him I ſhould quickly reſolve what to doe.
What would you doe (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) if you were in my roome; I would tell him in few
words (ſaid ſhe) that I could not abide him: What would be thought of a woman
ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> that ſhould ſpeake ſo, and what would they ſay of her? Miſtreſſe, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi>
words are but words, and opinion is but opinion, and both but wind; but to marry a
peeviſh Husband is a thing that would be felt all ones life: And therefore I ſhall thinke
you very inconſiderate in ſaying that you will not marry <hi>Silvander,</hi> whom you confeſſe
to be a man of much merit, and every way compleat, onely becauſe you know not from
whence he came. Ah Miſtreſſe, will you not eat fine fruit unleſſe you know the Tree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they grow? Oh the groſſeſt folly of all others, to purſue appearances with all eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and never care for things that are recall and truly good. God has infinitely bleſt me
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53527:47"/>
in giving me Parents of another mind; for I aſſure you, had they beene of ſuch a temper, I
ſhould have found them worke enough. <hi>Diana</hi> ſmiled at this, and ſaid, Your counſell
Siſter is very good, but not to be followed alwayes. For I beſeech you tell me; this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which you ſleight ſo much, and theſe appearances which you condemne, are they
any thing elſe but reputation, which is a thing as deare as life is? is there any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth more miſerable than a woman without this reputation, is there any condition

and it will be found a folly; but is there any thing amongſt us which is not folly, if it
be ſearched to the bottome? No, no Servant, all the world is nothing but a gloſſe, a vaine
ſhadow of good; though you and I doe know this to be true, yet by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of all, it is judged otherwiſe, and you or I muſt not be the firſt, to breake the Ice.
This makes me thinke upon the counſell that was given amongſt the Rats, who reſolved
for their ſafety to have a Bell tyed about the neck of the Cat, to the end they might hear
her when ſhe came, but upon the upſhot of the reſult, there was none amongſt all the
company that durſt attempt the doing it.</p>
                     <p>Diſcourſing thus, theſe faire ſhepherdeſſes dreſt themſelves: and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> not well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon what deſigne, did trim up her ſelf with more care and curioſity than ſhe did ſince
the loſſe of <hi>Celadon;</hi> which <hi>Phillis</hi> taking notice of, ſhe could not chuſe but ſmile, and
hinting it unto <hi>Diana,</hi> Miſtreſſe, ſaid ſhe, the ſhepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon</hi> are of a very odde
humour: Why? ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> becauſe I ſee, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> takes abundance of
paines to dreſſe her ſelfe better than ordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For my part I know no reaſon ſhe has for
it, unleſſe it be her affection to this faire Druid, whoſe acquaintance was but of yeſterday.
I pray tell me, is it the humour of the ſhepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon</hi> to aſſect ſo ſoone, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhepherdeſſes than ſhepherds? To which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> anſwered; Tis true, I have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
humour to make my ſelfe amiable, than ever I had, and there is good reaſon for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
when I was courted by ſhepherds, I thought my ſelfe of merit enough to make my
ſelfe loved amongſt them, never putting my ſelfe to any further trouble than to be ſeene:
But now if I will obtain the favour of this faire Druid, I muſt be as carefull of my ſelfe as
any Servant is in getting the favour of his Miſtreſſe. But Siſter, replyed <hi>Diana, Phillis</hi>
and I are either much miſtaken in our judgements, or elſe there is great defects in ſuch as
ſee you and doe not love you, though for nothing but for your merit. Upon this, they
had all dreſſed themſelves, and as they were going out of the Chamber, they ſaw <hi>Paris</hi>
walking with <hi>Leonide</hi> in the next room, and the ſhepherdeſſes were neere them before the

and when he ſaw them, after morning ſalutes, he asked <hi>Diana</hi> pardon, who anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him that he had committed no offence whith concerned her: For ſhe being the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
of the three, they had more reaſon to complaine than ſhe, if there was any cauſe at all;
and not ſtaying for his anſwer, ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe unto <hi>Leonide,</hi> and asked her whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>I know he will not deny you, for I know he muſt performe this duty once, and he will

loves and eſteems very much-and ſo ſhall we be all together, all the day to morrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
fair ſhepherdeſſes, be ſure you conceal me in the buſineſſe; for if <hi>Adamas</hi> ſhould know
that this advice comes from me, perhaps he would be angry, and make ſome difficulty in
it. Nor is it neceſſary that <hi>Alexis</hi> ſhould know, becauſe ſhe is of a very retired humour,
and never ſo well contented as when alone. I matter not if <hi>Paris</hi> be of the plot, becauſe I
know that he takes much delight in your company, and will not croſſe it. I ſhall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

will let <hi>Alexis</hi> go alſo? for the truth is, if all the world go, and <hi>Alexis</hi> ſtay behind, I
ſhall be but in a very bad mood, and perhaps ſhall hide my ſelfe from the trouble of all
the reſt of the company.</p>
                     <p>You ſee, Madam, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that the ſhepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon</hi> are no diſſemblers:
both ſhe, and all the reſt, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> are more worthy and eſtimable for it; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, from whence proceeds this great amity? by ſympathy, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and I am
not my ſelfe unleſſe I be by her: ſince ſo, ſaid the Nymph, I ſhall render you all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
that I am able, and I cannot chuſe but admire, for <hi>Alexis,</hi> the laſt night did
ſpeak the ſame of you, that you do now of her: I have a very intimate familiarity with
her, and know her uſual humour; but now ſhe is quite out of all her Naturalls, and
the alteration muſt needs proceed from ſome ſupernatural power. Madam, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi>
you will make her ſo proud, that we ſhall not be able to live with her: upon this they
came to the Chamber of <hi>Alexis,</hi> where they found her yet in bed; for being ſomething
early, and it being morning before her thoughts would give her leave to ſleepe, ſhe was
hardly awake when all this good company came into her Chamber.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, ſhe was much ſurprized at this unexpected viſit, but not ſo much as to
forget hiding the Ring which ſhe took from <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> when ſhe threw her ſelfe into <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
and which ſhe wore ever ſince about her arme in the ſame Ribband in which it was
tyed: alſo ſhe neglected not to cloſe her ſmock before her breaſt, leſt a difference of Sex
ſhould thereby be diſcovered, and leſt the faire <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſhould ſee the Picture which ſhe
uſed to wear about her neck, and which that ſhepherdeſſe knew very well; ſhe held one
hand before her face, and with the other took the ſheet and almoſt covered her ſelfe, as if
ſhe were aſhamed to be ſeen in that poſture. <hi>Leonide</hi> to make her ſelfe merry, ſaid thus
unto her; What do you think, Siſter, of theſe faire ones whom I have brought to helpe
you up? Siſter, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> and raiſed her ſelfe a little up, you have done me a great
ſhame, in doing me a great favour; for what will all theſe faire ones ſay, finding me
thus long in bed? The worſt they can ſay, replyed the Nimph, is that you are a ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
and that the Druids of <hi>Carnutes</hi> are not ſuch early riſers as the ſhepheardeſſes of

after a while of ſilence. I proteſt, fair ſhepheardeſſe (ſaid ſhe unto her) I have thought
upon you, and the diſcourſe we had all the night long. But tell me, I beſeech you; Is it

deſerve; but for all that, my genius is not agreeable, nor can ſuit it ſelfe to his. How is

above his own life, and this with exceſſe of diſobedience to an Uncle, who was unto him
in lieu of a Father, and from whom he hoped for his eſtate. But I have heard ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Alexis,</hi> that now he is out of this humour, and does not love her. I believe it true,
anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but it was when ſhe had loſt her beauty, and then his flame extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed;
ſo that as ſoon as my face changeth, his affection to me will change alſo.
What a ſad diſaſter would it be to me, if I ſhould live to ſee ſuch a change, nay the leaſt
diminution of good will to me? But Madam, continued ſhe with a deep ſigh, that is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53527:48"/>
not the principal difficulty; for perhaps I ſhould hope to keep his mind in due amity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not ſo low an opinion of my ſelf, but that with a little ſtudy, I ſhould hold him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
compaſſe of duty to me. But there is another obſtacle in the way which hinders me,
from ever marrying, far greater then all theſe. Yet, Madam, I dare not trouble you with
any ſuch ralations, and what would you think of me, for being ſo familiar as to talke
unto you of ſuch trivial matters? <hi>Alexis</hi> then ſhaked her hand, and ſaid, Did you but
know how infinitely I love you, certainly you would never ſpeake thus unto me, who
am infinitely deſirous to know your buſineſſe and intentions, that I may the better
ſerve you in them; whether it be by my own endeavours, and by the meanes of <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
or any other way you ſhall pleaſe to imploy me. Madam, replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſenſible of the great honour which you are pleaſed to confer upon me in your love,
and thinke it to be ſo high a happineſſe unto me, as I value it infinitely above my life: but
as for the offer you are pleaſed out of your abundant goodneſſe to make unto me concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Adamas,</hi> I humbly beſeech you never to ſpeake unto him in it, becauſe I would not
have him imployed in a buſineſſe of ſo ſmall a conſequence, and which I can well enough
bring to paſſe my ſelfe, aſſuring my ſelfe that I can deal well enough with <hi>Calidon.</hi> I
wiſh you may, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> but I am affraid you will find it a difficulty: when I looke
upon the beauty of your faire face; for beauty, faire <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> is Glue, or Bird-lime,
which will never let go thoſe wings which are touched with it. Madam, replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
I am not owner of ſo much beauty; or if I were, I hope my reſolution is ſtronger then
all the violencies and wilfulneſſe of Love.</p>
                     <p>And be pleaſed to know, that I will die a thouſand death, rather then I will ever
marry, ſince it is the will of heaven, or rather my bad fortune ſo to have it. At this word
ſhe ſtopped, and pulled out her Hankercher to wipe her eyes, for ſhe was not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
her Teares. And when ſhe was beginning her diſcourſe againe, the coming in of
<hi>Adamas</hi> prevented her; who coming into the Chamber by chance, and finding this
good company there, he was ſorry that he had interrupted them: for there was nothing
he deſired more, then to ſee <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> together, in hopes that this way would
remit <hi>Alexis</hi> into his former condition, and conſequently that his old age ſhould be very
happy and contented, according to the Oracle. Yet ſeeming as if his coming in was of
purpoſe; and after he had ſaluted all the ſhepheardeſſes, he ſaid thus unto <hi>Alexis:</hi> What
Daughter, in bed yet? What will all theſe faire ſhepheardeſſes ſay, ſeeing you ſuch a ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard!
Sir, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> the fault is in my ſiſter, who brought them hither without
giving me any notice. The fault, replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> is in your ſelfe, who are yet in bed;
and if they ſerved you aright, they would pull all the clothes off, and teach you to riſe
ſooner in the morning.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who was riſen off the bed, in reverence of <hi>Adamas:</hi> Reverend Father,
ſaid ſhe, There is reaſon why we ſhould riſe early, becauſe we have flocks to look unto:
Moreover, it is fit, <hi>Alexis</hi> ſhould preſerve her beauty without taking any paines. You
may ſay what you pleaſe, replyed <hi>Adamas;</hi> But my opinion is, that if ſhe will be fair,
ſhe muſt doe as you doe; for your beauty may tell her, that your Receipt is a very good
one. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> bluſht a little, and would have replyed, if one had not come to acquaint
<hi>Adamas,</hi> that <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> ſtayed for him in the great Chamber; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he taking the ſhepheardeſſes by their hands, they all left <hi>Alexis</hi> to dreſſe her ſelfe,
whilſt ſhe went to ſhew unto this good company the rarities of his houſe, which indeed
were curioſities of much admiration.</p>
                     <p>After all the Company was aſſembled together, and that to the great contentment of
<hi>Hylas, Alexis</hi> was come unto them, <hi>Adamas</hi> thought it beſt, before dinner, to ſhew them
the Walkes, and the rather becauſe the Sun was masked with many Clouds: Every one
applyed themſelves unto thoſe that beſt pleaſed them, except <hi>Silvander, Hylas,</hi> and <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi>
For <hi>Paris</hi> tooke <hi>Diana</hi> whom <hi>Silvander</hi> out of reſpect was conſtrained to quit:

Pray good Shepherdeſſe, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> never take you any care; he that cares for the birds
of the Aire, will not let her be without helpe; and for want of a better, I will tender my

ſervice unto her, and at the ſame time he took <hi>Alexis</hi> by the other arme. Truly (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
halfe angry that ſhe could not be alone with <hi>Alexis</hi>) it is eaſie to know <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you
are none of the Shepherds of <hi>Lignon,</hi> for they doe never uſe to be ſo impudently bold: I
doe beleeve it, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and it is very likely, that they being Shepherds are not ſo
couragious as I am: Methinkes, replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that ſince you aſſume the ſame habit,
you ſhould alſo aſſume the ſame courage. No, no Shepherdeſſe (anſwered he) a Hero
is not leſſe hardy for having a ruſty Sword; but on the contrary, if examples of vertue
have any influence upon Shepherds, <hi>Calidon</hi> whom I ſee there looking upon you, as if he
would began Alms; would doe as I doe. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> looked downe with her eyes upon the
ground, fearing leaſt if this diſcourſe continued, that young Shepherd ſhould imitate <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
and ſo of one fault ſhe ſhould make two, ſhe was ſilent, and ſaid not a word more:
But <hi>Hylas</hi> obſerving this, and having an opinion that if any would divert <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he
might the more eaſily talke with <hi>Alexis,</hi> he made a ſigne unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> which made
him more confident than uſuall, and therefore after an humble reverence unto the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe,
he tooke her arme, pretending he would helpe her to walke. The Shepherdeſſe
ſeeing there was no remedy, turned her head towards <hi>Alexis,</hi> and ſaid thus; I ſee that
bad examples are ſooner followed than the good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I muſt now recall that advantage
which I gave unto the Shepherds of <hi>Lignon:</hi> Alas, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> and ſhooke her head if
our lives had none of theſe bitter wormwoods, we ſhould be but too happy, ſhe ſpoke
this in ſo low a voice, that neither <hi>Hylas</hi> nor <hi>Calidon</hi> heard her; yet the cold entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which this ſhepherd received from this ſhepherdeſſe did make him thinke that ſhe
had much rather be alone with the Druide; but ſeeming to take no notice of it, he
continued on his deſigne, ſo as now there was none without a Companion but <hi>Silvander.</hi>
But <hi>Laonice</hi> who ſtill nouriſhed a ſpirit of revenge againſt him, and ſought for an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of doing him ſome ſignall diſpleaſure ever ſince the day that by his judgement ſhe
loſt <hi>Tircis;</hi> ſeeing him thus alone, ſhe thought now that ſhe had met with a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity;
ſhe knew already what affection he had unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and what affection <hi>Diana</hi>
had unto him: For their loves being great, it was impoſſible to hide it from her who kept
a very obſervant eye over all their actions. Therefore ſeeing him alone, and very penſive,
ſhe went unto him, and put on a face far different from her heart: Shepherd, ſaid ſhe,
I ſee ſo many ſignes of ſorrow painted in your face, as I cannot chuſe but thinke, that
perhaps you are in love: Shepherdeſſe, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> I have ſo many ſeverall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
of ſorrow, as you need not aske me whether Love be a cauſe: I thinke, ſaid ſhe,
you have no new occaſions, for of late dayes you are more contented than uſuall; but
will you give me leave to tell you what I thinke? The cauſe of your melancholly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
either from a diſeaſe preſent, or from a diſeaſe abſent: You muſt explane the Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
anſwered the ſhepherd, before I can returne an anſwer; I meane replyed <hi>Laonice,</hi>
ſince you would have me ſpeake cleerly, that either griefe preſent torments you, ſeeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
in your roome with your Miſtreſſe: or elſe the good which is abſent; for I know
that you doe love <hi>Madonthe:</hi> Sage ſhepherdeſſe, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> I ſee you are a great
Prophereſſe: For it is one of theſe two that does torment me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but perhaps (ſaid he
and ſmiled) not ſo much as you imagine. Sometimes in ſuch diſeaſes (ſaid <hi>Laonice</hi>) one
is apt not to think themſelves ſo ill as they are, but in good earneſt <hi>Silvander,</hi> which of
theſe two is it that moſt troubles you? Which doe you thinke, ſaid <hi>Silvander?</hi> If I
ſhould tel you my opinion, ſaid <hi>Laonice,</hi> perhaps you would not confeſs it. Were it a crime
to love, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> I muſt confeſſe I had no reaſon to confeſſe; but ſince it is rather
a vertue, or at the leaſt an action which in it ſelfe is neither good nor bad, why ſhould you
thinke I will not confeſſe it; ſince in denying a truth I ſhould commit a greater ſinne:
Moſt true, ſhepherd, replyed <hi>Laonice,</hi> for every one who would be eſteemed good, ought
above all things to be very carefull they never injure the truth: and therefore <hi>Silvander</hi>
tell me upon your reputation; does not the abſent good trouble you more than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
evill? <hi>Silvander</hi> had no mind of making his affections knowne unto this ſtranger, if
poſſibly he could avoid it, and therefore with a ſmile anſwered her: I cannot chuſe but
admire at the quickneſſe of your ſight, diſcreet <hi>Laonice;</hi> for I durſt have ſworne that
none had taken notice of theſe things; but I beſeech you, how came you to this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?
<hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid ſhe, content your ſelfe with this that all theſe diſſimulations
which you uſe to <hi>Diana</hi> may perhaps amuze <hi>Therſander,</hi> but not ſuch as have with my
eyes obſerved your actions: All thoſe that live about the delectable River of <hi>Lignon,</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:53527:49"/>
have their hearts ſo poſſeſſed with their owne paſſions, as they never obſerve anothers?
have no eyes for any but for them they love. But I who have nothing elſe to doe, but to
obſerve the actions of all, I doe plainly ſee that <hi>Madonthe</hi> does pleaſe you more than
<hi>Diana;</hi> but be not ſorry that I know it, for perhaps it will not be unſerviceable to you:
<hi>Madonthe</hi> loves me, and I think ſhe will be eaſily induced unto any thing I ſhall perſwade;
I know what it is to love, and which way to compaſſe the contentments of it, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you to aide and ſerve you in all I am able. <hi>Silvander</hi> could not chuſe but laugh to
heare her talke thus, and to confirme her in the opinion which ſhe had conceived, he
beſeeched her to be ſilent, and above all, not to acquaint <hi>Madonthe,</hi> leaſt it ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
her, and ſo ruine his whole deſigne; he thanked her for her kind offers, which he
would not refuſe, but would not make uſe of at that time, for ſeverall reaſons which
hereafter ſhould be made knowne unto her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvander</hi> thought himſelf very ſubtle in this, but <hi>Laonice</hi> who ſeemed to beleeve him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to contrive the miſchiefe which ſhe intended him, upon it, and which ſince ſhe made
him pay ſo dear for. In the mean time <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> were entred deepe into diſcourſe;
for this young man was ſo inflamed with a violent affection unto this ſhepherdeſſe, as he
could never reſt, but when he was with her. Certainly, if ſhe had intended to love any,
ſhe would have pitched here; but ſince the death of <hi>Filander,</hi> ſhe would never ſuffer
love to take any hold of her affections, thinking none worthy to be Succeſſor unto ſuch
a ſhepherd as <hi>Filander.</hi> If ſhe did afterwards love <hi>Silvander,</hi> it was not out of deſigne,
but upon a ſurprize which the merits and addreſſes of that ſhepherd made upon her; ſo as
the good will which ſhe had unto <hi>Paris</hi> was no more than as a ſiſter unto a brother, and
ſo farre ſhe thought her ſelfe obliged by the affection he had unto her; and ſhe was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from any farther, by the affection ſhe bare unto the memory of the courteous <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>
yet he whoſe affection had no limits, to render unto her all poſſible teſtimonies of
his love, he reſolved to try his fortune, and thinking this opportunity to be good, he
would not let it ſlip: leading her therefore by the arm, he drew her a little from the
reſt, and whilſt every one was buſied in their owne various conceptions, he ſpoke thus
unto her. I cannot chuſe but wonder, faireſt <hi>Diana,</hi> that all my endeavours to doe you
all ſervice, ſhould not let you ſee the great affection which I have unto you; or if you
do ſee it, I wonder more that it ſhould have no greater operation, nor produce any more
reciprocall good will in your ſoule: Though my ſervices cannot merit ſo high as love,
for that were too much happineſſe, yet Methinkes they might at the leaſt produce ſome
ſparkes of good will, and be in ſome degree pleaſing unto you; I have tryed all wayes,
and in this cannot but accuſe the meaneſſe of my merit, and the greatneſſe of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
I have tryed, I ſay, and doe find all wayes that are advantagious unto others who
are in love, but find them all unprofitable unto me; you injure my extreame affection;
my ſervices diſpleaſe you; my patience makes me deſpicable: my conſtancy tedious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and the very age I ſpend in loving, ſerving and adoring you, is ſo ſterile, as you
hardly take notice, I am any thing yours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh Heavens, can ſuch cruelty, if not ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
accompany ſuch a noble ſoule? will you never ſuffer my tears to mollifie your heart

                     <p>At this word <hi>Paris</hi> was ſilent, as well becauſe he feared that his eyes could not
reſtraine thoſe teares which theſe words would bring from his heart if he continued his
diſcourſe, as becauſe he would give <hi>Diana</hi> time to ſpeake ſome words of conſolation to
him. She, who did love him, as I told you before, not thinking him ſo deeply engaged
in the Fetters of love, and deſiring if it were poſſible not to let him depart diſpleaſed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a ſweet glance of her eye towards him, ſaid thus unto him; I did not thinke gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Paris</hi> to have heard ſuch language from you, which is as farre from my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the Heavens are from the Earth; you blame me for being inſenſible, and that
I doe not acknowledge the affection which you have unto me, and I beſeech you, what
would you thinke of me, if not loving you, yet I ſhould behave my ſelfe towards you as
I doe: Have I not ſhewed you as much plauſibility and favour as I am capable off? Did
I not alwayes anſwer you with all courteſie and civility that was hanſome for me doe;
What can you deſire more of me? do you ſee me Garaſſe any more then your ſelfe? do
I not apply my ſelfe more unto you, then any other? and at this very time, do I offer to
talk or glance any eye upon any but your ſelfe? Oh faireſt ſhepheardeſs (ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> and
ſighed) I do confeſs all you ſay, and that you do more for me, than for any other: but
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53527:50"/>
what am I the better, as long as you do nothing for any elſe, nor me neither? If my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were not as it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I mean, extream, perhaps I ſhould not with ſo much importunity beg
teſtimonies of your good will. And as much as you ſay, you have done for me: what I
beſeech you have you done, but onely as to the ſon of <hi>Adamas</hi> the firſt time you ſaw
him, and before he gave teſtimony of any affection? All your actions towards me, I muſt
confeſſe are full of civility and ſweetneſſe, But are you not obliged to the ſame towards
all of my qualitie? Can you thinke theſe duties that belong to my Name and Quality,
can ſatisfie for thoſe that are due unto a violent affection? No, no, fair one, Civility and
Courteſie will ſerve the ſon of <hi>Adamas,</hi> but nothing elſe but Love can ſatisfie <hi>Paris:</hi>
There muſt be a reciprocall compliance, before I can leave complaining; and I muſt
blame you of inſenſibility, and my ſelfe of ill fortune, in loving ſo great a beauty with
a hard heart. Then <hi>Diana</hi> after a little pauſe, returned him this anſwer: I thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
now, <hi>Paris,</hi> that there had been nothing in my actions but what would have pleaſed
you, thinking that I had regulated them according to the Rules which Virgins ought to
obſerve, even when they have a deſigne to pleaſe and oblige; but I perceive I was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but to ſhew my repentance, and how free I am with you, I will very ſincerely tell you
my thoughts: I honour you <hi>Paris,</hi> as much as I do any man in the world; and I do
love you as much as I do my brother; if this will not content you, I cannot tell what
you can deſire more.</p>
                     <p>Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> This Declaration is indeed very pleaſing unto me, and as the
Son of <hi>Adamas,</hi> I am fully ſatisfied; but, as <hi>Paris,</hi> not at all: becauſe my affection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
nothing more; not Courteſie for Courteſie, but Love for Love. If you be not
contented and ſatisfied with this I have told you <hi>Paris,</hi> replyed the ſhepheardeſſe, you
muſt look for more from your ſelfe, ſince you ſuffer your deſires to go beyond due limits;
and I have a juſt cauſe of complaint againſt you, if I would take it, for pretending more
from me, then I ought to give<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Tis very true, replyed <hi>Paris,</hi> that you would have moſt
juſt cauſe of complaint, if faire ſhepherdeſſe, I ſhould deſire any thing from you which
was not fit for you to grant: But all my deſires being grounded upon honour and virtue,
methinks you ſhould not complaine againſt them; And to open my heart moſt freely
unto her that owes it, know fair ſhepherdeſſe, that I am ſo wholly devoted unto you,
that I ſhall never enjoy any reſt or contentment, untill you be alſo mine, upon condition
of marriage. You do me much honour, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> in having ſuch thoughts: but
you muſt know, that I have Parents, unto whoſe wiſdome I refer all ſuch matters: and
yet if you will have me ſhew you my very heart, I do ſweare, <hi>Paris,</hi> that neither you nor
they, nor any alive, are able to move me unto any ſuch mind of marriage. I do love you
as my Brother, but cannot as a Husband; and do not think this ſtrange, for my minde
is the ſame towards all men living. Oh ye Gods, ſaid <hi>Paris</hi> then, muſt I never receive
any perfect contentment? You ſay that you do love me as your Brother, but you or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
that this Love muſt all my life long be a barren, ſteril, and fruitleſſe love, <hi>Paris,</hi>
ſaid ſhe, what would you have me ſay? have you a mind I ſhould deceive you? or with
ſome ſmooth diſſembling language, give you ſome deluding hopes? methinks I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
you in diſcovering my reſolution ſo freely and genuinely unto you. Oh ſhepherdeſs,
ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> with a profound ſigh, what a moſt diſobliging obligation is this? how many
ſad ſighs and ſorrowful tears muſt I pay unto your cruelty, to acquit my ſelfe of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
obligation.</p>
                     <p>They would have continued longer, when coming to a croſs-walk, they were hindred
by the reſt of the company, who were returning to the houſe; for <hi>Adamas</hi> was told it
was dinner time, and <hi>Alexis</hi> tired with the talke of <hi>Hylas,</hi> and to be ſo long ſeparated
from <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſhe took all occaſions of being with her againe; and as ſoon as ſhe ſaw
<hi>Diana, I</hi> beſeech you fair ſhepherdeſſe (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi> unto her) help me to defend my
ſelfe againſt the fine diſcourſe of <hi>Hylas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> for <hi>I</hi> aſſure you, <hi>I</hi> know not how to anſwer
him: Miſtreſſe (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) thoſe that cannot defend themſelves, they muſt yield unto
the courteſie of their enemies. <hi>I</hi> had rather die (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi> and ſmiled) then render
my ſelfe unto the mercy of ſuch a conqueror. Rather then you ſhould die, ſaid <hi>Hylas, I</hi>
would render the victory, and yeeld my ſelfe the conquered. Truly, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> you are
very courteous: but, <hi>Hylas, I</hi> am of ſo proud a temper, and ſo little deſirous to be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
as I know not whether I ſhould receive your offer. Why ſhould you make a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
of it, ſaid <hi>Hylas?</hi> is it perhaps you ſcorn it? No anſwered <hi>Alexis;</hi> but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53527:50"/>
I feare leſt being victorious in that manner, I ſhould be overcome. Oh heavens,
ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and cryed out, I ever thought it a dangerous buſineſſe to love a learned wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and one that is brought up amongſt the Druids of <hi>Carnutes:</hi> I do vow and ſweare
by the love I have to you, that when I began firſt to love you, I was afraid of nothing
more then that you were not ſimple enough. Why good <hi>Hylas</hi> (ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> who was
very glad to mingle diſcourſe, purpoſely to be rid of <hi>Paris</hi>) would you love one that was
ſimple? Truly, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I would not have her a fool, nor would I have her over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
ſo ſhe have as much wit as to believe all I tell her, I would not have her able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the deep ſciences of our learned Druids. But if ſhe ſhould have no more wit then
to believe you, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> you would be put to a great deale of paine, by reaſon of
the cure you would have in the carriage of her ſelfe. You are much deceived ſhepherdeſſe
(ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) for what is pleaſure to one, is never painful. Some ſay ſo indeed, ſaid
<hi>Diana,</hi> but I do not think ſo; for I believe the pleaſure onely keepes them from thinking
of the paine: but that they have none is an error, ſince if they be put to any violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
they will blow and paint as if they wanted breath. See <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you
are one of thoſe two, whom I would not love; you have too much wit, and put me to pain
in ſtudying how to anſwer you, which is a thing I cannot abide: but on the contrary,
I ſhould be extreamly contented, if ſhe admire all I do, and all I ſay: from admiration
proceeds from a good opinion, and from this good opinion will proceed the love that
I deſire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvander</hi> who was neare, and watched for an occaſion of ſeconding <hi>Diana</hi> in her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
Admiration, ſaid he, will work the contrary effect which you deſire. Why ſo?
ſaid <hi>Hylas;</hi> for if ſhe admire me, ſhe will believe me full of great and high parts; and
when I ſpeak, <hi>I</hi> am an Oracle unto her, my deſires will be Lawes, and my will Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
Admiration will produce quite contrary effects, replyed <hi>Silvander;</hi> For the
learned ſay, that Admiration is the mother of Verity, in as much as admiring any thing
the minde of man is naturally apt to ſearch for the knowledge of it, and this ſearch makes
him find out the truth: and ſo <hi>Hylas,</hi> in ſaying that ſhe will admire you, you doe as
much as ſay, that ſhe will know you; and knowing you, ſhe will finde that if ſhee eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing in you, ſhe is miſtaken; and then in ſcorning you, ſhe will admire that ſhe
ſhould admire you: <hi>I</hi> perceive ſhepheard, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you are one of thoſe wits,
which, were <hi>I</hi> a woman, <hi>I</hi> ſhould never love: But though you can talk well, yet talke as
long as you will, <hi>I</hi> am ſtill in the ſame opinion; for he who does admire whilſt he is in
that admiration, does he not infinitely eſteem the party that cauſeth it? 'Tis true; ſaid
<hi>Silvander;</hi> but then preſently after that, he will change when he comes to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Truth. This, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> does give me ſatisfaction: for in ſaying ſhe
will change preſently, let me tell you, my good friend <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid he, and clapt him
upon the ſhoulder, ſhe may chance to doe as <hi>I</hi> may do; but let her make as much haſte
as ſhe can, <hi>I</hi> will pardon her if ſhe change ſooner then my ſelfe: and if ſhe do chance
to be before me, faith ile over take her preſently. This anſwer cauſed every one to laugh,
and this diſcourſe entertained them till they came into the houſe, where the Table was
furniſhed with many delicacies, and every one ſat down as the night before.</p>
                     <p>All dinner while, nothing was almoſt talked on, but the merry humour of <hi>Hylas;</hi>
and to put him upon diſcourſe, there was alwayes ſome or other who took his part.
Amongſt the reſt, <hi>Stella,</hi> who though ſhe did it in ſhew to pleaſe the company, yet was it
not at all againſt her humour, ſhe having all her life long followed the rules of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And <hi>Corilas</hi> who had heretofore reſented the effects of it, hearing how ſhe took
part with <hi>Hylas:</hi> Shepherd, ſaid he unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> I beſeech you tell me; is it true
that love does grow from ſympathy? All thoſe who ever ſpoke of it, anſwered <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
ſay Yes, Then, ſaid <hi>Corilas,</hi> am I the onely one that believes the contrary, and have
had full experience of it: For can two humours be more like, than thoſe of <hi>Hylas</hi> and
<hi>Stella?</hi> and yet I do not ſee there is any love betwixt them. There was not one at all
the Table, who did not laugh when they heard this diſcourſe of <hi>Corilas.</hi> And when <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi>
would have anſwered, <hi>Stella</hi> interrupted him, in ſaying; I do not bluſh, ſhepherd,
at a thing which hath given me all the contentment I enjoy; for had I not changed when
I loved you, I had loſt it; and you muſt accuſe the reaſon which <hi>Silvander</hi> gave, for my
changing which is, that Admiration is the mother of Truth: for at the firſt not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you, I did admire you; and when I did know you, ſcorned you; ſo as you may very
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53527:51"/>
well give this Motto; <hi>Farre off, ſomething; neer nothing.</hi> But, ſaid ſhe, and ſmiled; as
you ſay, that I am Inconſtant for loving you once, and not loving you; ſo you may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſay that I am Conſtant, in changing once only and continuing in a reſolution of never
loving you, as long as I live. The queſtion which I asked, replyed <hi>Corilas,</hi> is not whether
you be a wavering Weather-cocke or no: But whether (<hi>Hylas</hi> and you being alike, and
ſimpathy being a cauſe of love) whether you doe love one another? Unto this ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſaid, I will tell you <hi>Corilas,</hi> that ſimpathy may worke its effects, when there is no
greater force to oppoſe it; And that ſimpathy which may be betwixt <hi>Hylas</hi> and me,
might have ſo much force as to make us love, if it were not that knowing thee ſo little wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of love, thou haſt made me have ſuch an ill opinion of all other ſhepherds, as I know not
whether ever I ſhall love any. You have taught me a leſſon, ſaid <hi>Corilas:</hi> For having
had ſo much experience of you, I cannot conceive that thoſe who are under the ſame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
you are, doe not hide under thoſe habits the ſame imperfections: Fie, fie, ſaid all the
ſhepherds, this, <hi>Corilas,</hi> is too much, to blame all the reſt: No, ſaid <hi>Corilas,</hi> my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not to blame them: I onely ſay, that I cannot conceive they have not ſame imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
I doe not ſay, they have them, and in this I blame onely my ſelfe, as not having
the judgment to know the truth: But of all this, I accuſe this deceiver, who yet cannot
glory in her victory, for ſhe has paid deer for it.</p>

and deſiring to know every thing, ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe unto the ſage <hi>Adamas:</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
Father, ſaid ſhe unto him, that to part theſe two friendly Enemies (for ſhe knew
they were ſo called) and to ſatisfie a curioſity wherein I have long lived, you would doe
very well to tell us what this Simpathy is, of which they ſpeake, and whether it will
cauſe love; and in ſo doing, you will feaſt us double, both in our bodies, and in our
minds. Madam, anſwered <hi>Adamas,</hi> your curioſity is commendable, and did I not give
it ſatisfaction I were much to blame, as well in not obeying what you pleaſe to command,
as in not informing ſuch as deſire it, as my charge obliges me; and the ſooner, becauſe I
am able to doe it in few words: Be pleaſed to know, Madam, that <hi>Tautates</hi> the ſupream
Creator of all things, did make Heaven, which is his chiefeſt Manſion, and the place where
he created all ſoules, and becauſe it is nothing likely that any thing ſhould come out of
the hand of ſuch an excellent Workeman which is not in its full perfection, he formed
the ſoule by intellectuall participation. Now this participation is taken from the pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of that Planet which is predominate when it is created, and this perfection
which it receives, is ſo agreeable to it, as it is inflamed with love of that intelligence
which did impart it unto it. And even as a Lover doth forme an Idea of the thing loved in
his fancy, as perfectly as poſſibly he can, to the end it may fill the eyes of his ſoule, and
pleaſe himſelfe in this contemplation when he is deprived of the ſight of that beloved face;
ſo likewiſe this ſoule being in love with the ſupream beauty of this Intelligence, and of
this Planet when it entred into the body unto which it gave the forme, it did imprint
not onely the ſenſe and the airy body, in which the learned ſay it is wrapped but alſo the
fancy with this Character, with the beauty of which it was ardently inflamed in heaven,
ſo as it can apprehend a figure and perfect reſemblance of it: and pleaſing it ſelfe in this
contemplation it conceives a certaine naturall diſpoſition to eſteeme all that reſembles
it good and beautifull, and to diſlike generally all that is unlike unto it, accuſtoming
its judgement in ſuch ſort unto this will as it becomes habituall, from which we cannot
refraine without very great force upon our ſelves: From hence it is, that as ſoone as we
caſt our eyes upon any one; if they doe report unto our ſoules, as faithfull Mirrrors,
that there is in this perſon ſomething which doth reſemble that Image of Intelligence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
we doe love, without any farther diſcourſe in our ſelves, or other ſearch for
the occaſion of this good will, being drawne unto it by an inſtinct which may be termed
blind: On the contrary we doe hate, if we doe find them different; and this is it they
call ſimpathy, which is that conformity which we find betwixt one another; and which
indeed is the ſource of love and not beauty altogether, as many believe: For if beauty
were the ſource of love, it would follow that all faire ones would be loved of all: But
we ſee on the contrary, that not the moſt faire and the moſt worthy, but thoſe onely who
come neereſt to our humour, and with whom we have moſt conformity, are thoſe whom
we doe love beſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:53527:51"/>
Here the Druide ſtopt, and <hi>Daphnide</hi> began thus; I muſt confeſſe with thankes, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Father, that you have at once cleered ſeverall doubts unto me, yet one remaines in
which I much deſire ſatisfaction. If it be ſo that love proceeds from that reſemblance that
I meet with all in the party that I doe love: How comes it to paſſe, that the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
does not make him love me? For, if I do love by this ſimpathy, and if this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
doe come as you doe ſay, Methinkes it is impoſſible but that he muſt have the ſame
inclination unto me, that I have unto him; My meaning is, that the ſame Planet muſt
have the ſame influence upon us both; yet for all that we ſee many who doe not at all
affect thoſe who are even ready to dye for the love of them. Your doubt, Madam, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Adamas,</hi> deſerves a cleering; it is very ingeniouſly moved, and ſhewes the excellency
of that ſpirit from whence it comes.</p>
                     <p>Be pleaſed therefore to know, Madam, that as I told you, the ſoule fancies unto it ſelfe
an Idea, and the moſt perfect image that it can of this Planet, and of that Intelligence or
apprehenſion which it loves; but in as much as, to repreſent ſo faire and ſo perfect an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
the matter is of ſuch an inferiour ſort, as it is able to doe it but very imperfectly:
It muſt enſue that this repreſentation is not equally perfect in every one, becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the body is better diſpoſed in ſome than in others, and accordingly as the ſoul does
find it, ſo does it worke more or leſſe perfectly; As in painting, if the pencill, and the
colours be naught, the Painter muſt needs make bad work, and but little reſemblant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the thing he would repreſent, ſo the ſoule finding the body indiſpoſed to receive the
figure and lineaments, that ſhe would give of this beauty which it loves, the reſemblance
remaines ſo imperfect, as the features are hardly knowable: And when this happens thus,
doubtleſſe he that hath the moſt perfect repreſentation of this Intelligence, and of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
ſhall be loved by ſimpathy of the other who hath it, though ill done: For his ſoule,
though it hath not the repreſentation of this face which it loves, in this body, to the life;
yet does love the Portraiture when he ſees it well done in what place ſoever it be; but on
the contrary, that ſoule which ſhall meet with a matter: well diſpoſed, and which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
hath the Idea and patterne well repreſented; it daigns not to turne its eyes upon
the other, either becauſe it ſcornes it, ſeeing it ſo ill made, or becauſe it knowes
it not, having ſo little reſemblance; and from hence proceeds that love which is
not mutuall.</p>
                     <p>But (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi> and interrupted) good Father give me leave to aske you one queſtion:
If theſe loves proceed from ſimpathy how comes it to paſſe, that after one hath loved ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he ſometimes ceaſeth that love; nay, ſometimes to ſcorne, and often to hate. This
queſtion, anſwered the Druid, and ſmiled, is a queſtion fit for <hi>Hylas,</hi> and you may ſee
that this ſimpathy is a blind inſtinct, ſince <hi>Hylas</hi> loving and ceaſing to love one and the
ſame ſubject, yet he does not know why he does ſo: But <hi>Hylas,</hi> I will tell you, to the
end that hereafter you may know the reaſon of thoſe things which you doe ſo well
practiſe.</p>
                     <p>Imagine, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that thoſe impreſſions which the ſoule makes in her body, by which
ſhe repreſents this ſuperiour beauty of her underſtanding, and of her Planet, be indeed
corporeall: For ſhe drawes the lineaments in the fancy, as a Lover does the features of
thoſe he loves in his imagination, and repreſents them in ſuch ſort in his ſenſes, and in his
complexion, as ſhe makes his humour melancholy, if ſhe have any influence from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne;</hi>
and merry, if from <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and ſo of the reſt. And afterwards, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſaid, ſhe takes ſo great a cuſtome in contemplating and approving theſe things, as
ſhe has made it habituall, which though it be very difficult to change or loſe, yet it may
be changed and loſt. As we ſee commonly come to paſſe, in wax and a ſeale: Though
the wax have an impreſſion and figure, yet if one will make a new impreſſion, the ſame
wax loſes the firſt figure, and takes the new; ſo the ſoule having imprinted this Coeleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Character in the ſenſes, if they through careleſſeneſſe be not pleaſed with it, or elſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
new objects make the will rove after them; it is certaine, theſe will marke his fancy
with another figure, and it will ſo loſe the firſt reſemblance, as that it will retaine no
ſhadow of it; and then the party who was loved by him, or who loved him by ſimpathy
loſing this reſemblance which he had, he loſeth alſo the love which it cauſed. For even
as Habitudes, ſo ſimpathy, may be loſt, and gotten; but <hi>Hylas,</hi> if every time you have
changed, you have imprinted a new Idea in your ſelfe, there is none in the world whoſe
impreſſions are not in you; ſo as my daughter may hope that you will be more conſtant
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53527:52"/>
unto her, than you have been to all the world; not that ſhe merits more then her world of
Predeceſſors, but becauſe ſhe is the laſt. Every one laughed at the concluſion; and <hi>Hylas</hi>
had anſwered, if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had not interpoſed.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech you, Father, ſaid ſhe, if it be ſo that love doth proceed from this ſympathy,
how comes it to paſſe, one ſhould be long acquainted with another without any love,
and yet love at laſt? The anſwer which I gave unto <hi>Hylas,</hi> replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> may ſerve
unto this queſtion: At the firſt, that perſon had not the Character of the beauty of this
intelligence; and ſince by a new mark, as with a new ſeale, he might have it imprinted:
but to demonſtrate it a little clearer.</p>
                     <p>The ſoul being wrapped in theſe bodies of ours, as long as it is there ſhut up as in a
Priſon, ſhe does not underſtand, nor comprehend any thing but onely by the ſenſes by
which, as by ſo many windowes, ſhe come to the knowledge of all that is in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe:
And ſhe does not onely not underſtand nor comprehend, but by them; but alſo
ſhe can neither underſtand nor comprehend, but by corporeal repreſentations, although
ſhe does ſtudy and contemplate the incorporeal ſubſtances. Hence it comes to paſſe, that
ſhe cannot have a knowledge of things more perfectly, then as the ſenſes preſent them
unto her: and if they be falſe and deluders, they deceive her, and cauſe her to be of a
falſe judgement; as we ſee in ſuch as are ſick, who think meats though never ſo good, yet
to be ill taſted, becauſe their guſt is depraved. So likewiſe, ſuch as have ill eyes, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
ſee things double, or of another colour: or yet, though the eyes be good and
ſound, yet ſome interpoſitions betwixt the eye and the object may delude; as if they look
through a blew or red Glaſs, all they ſee ſeems to be of the ſame colours: A ſtraight ſtaff
put into the water, will ſeem crooked; and all things greater or leſſer, according to the
qualities of the Spectacles through which they are looked upon. Now theſe falſities,
being repreſented by the ſenſes, for truths, the ſoule which gives credit unto them, is
preſently corrupted in her judgement, becauſe the things preſuppoſed, and from whence
ſhe drawes conſequences, are ſuch: The Judgement being made, the Will immediately
conſents unto it: The Will, I ſay, which has that which is good for her object, and
that which is judged ſo, or which on the contrary, does fly that which ſhe thinks to be
evill.</p>
                     <p>And from hence you may underſtand, fair ſhepherdeſſe, that the reaſon why ſometimes
we ſee one whom we doe not love, yet afterwards do love; is, either becauſe our eyes and
our ſenſes, whoſe office is to preſent theſe things unto the ſoule, are not faithful in the
functions; or elſe the Mediums by which they act, have ſome imperfection which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them from doing their duties faithfully; which imperfections being removed, they
come to diſcover the truth, and relate it unto the ſoule, which then finding this reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
brings ardently to love that which before ſhe ſaw and did not care for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diana,</hi> who hearkened very attentively unto <hi>Adamas:</hi> Reverend Father, ſaid ſhe,
and ſmiled, I would gladly propound one queſtion unto you, did I not thinke I ſhould
be too troubleſome in it: No, ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> whatſoever ſo ſweet a ſhepherdeſſe ſhall ask,
I ſhall anſwer if I be able: Surely, ſaid ſhe, the wiſe <hi>Adamas</hi> is able to anſwer many
more, then ſuch a filly ignorant ſhepherdeſſe as I am can aske. Tell me, I beſeech you,
ſince love proceeds from ſympathy, which is an image repreſented in us, of that Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and Planet under which we were born; how comes it to paſſe, that faire ones are
commonly loved by every one? For it ſhould ſeem that all thoſe who love, are born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one and the ſame planet, which we know they are not, being borne at ſeverall
times.</p>
                     <p>I ever expected, anſwered <hi>Adamas</hi> that this ſubtil ſhepherdeſſe would aske ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
which was not common; but I will try if I can anſwer it. All fair things, although
they be differing, yet have ſome conformity amongſt themſelves, as all good things have;
and therefore ſome have ſaid, That there is but one good, and one faire, after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of which all things good and faire are judged to be ſuch. Now theſe Planets, and
theſe Intelligences which govern them, are neither good nor faire, but onely as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
moſt the ſupream good and faire. And though they are amongſt themſelves ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and differing; yet they are not amiable nor eſtimable, but as they are good and
fair: And this Goodneſſe and Fairneſſe having alwaies conformitie, though they be in
divers ſubjects; it need not be thought ſtrange, if many doe love thoſe perſons who are
faire, though they be not born under the ſame Planet, ſince every one obſerves in their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53527:52"/>
beauty ſomething which is conformable unto their owne.</p>
                     <p>I am now, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> the moſt contented man in the world, for I have learned one
thing which will be highly advantagious unto me. And you <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid he, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards him, you have reaſon to be mute at this diſcourſe, for it nothing concernes
you. I do not know, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> wherein it will much advantage you. O ignorant
ſhepheard, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> didſt thou not hear the wiſe <hi>Adamas</hi> ſay, that the reaſon why
faire ones are loved by ſo many, was, becauſe their beauty had a conformity with all the
Planets and Intelligencies? I heard it very well, anſwered <hi>Silvander;</hi> but what does that
advantage you? In this, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſince I do love ſo many ſeveral beauties, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
that I have conformity with them all; ſo conſequently am fairer then you are, who
never looks but upon one. I think, replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> and ſmiled, that if your argument
be good, you are not onely fairer then I am, but then any in the Country, nay then all,
put them all together; but you muſt not underſtand the diſcourſe of the ſage <hi>Adamas</hi>
in that ſort; but on the contrary, if you remember what he anſwered <hi>Daphnide,</hi> you
will finde that it is a ſigne of a great defect in you, who has the portraiture of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
and Planet ſo ill made, as there is not one of theſe faire ones who does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
to ſee in thee ſo great imperfection of a thing ſo perfect.</p>
                     <p>This moved all to laughter, and <hi>Hylas</hi> had replyed ſomething in his own defence, had
they not riſen from the Table, it being very late, and becauſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the counſell which <hi>Leonide</hi> gave her, to entreat <hi>Adamas</hi> that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to come unto their Town, and offer the ſacrifice of Thanks for the fortunate Misſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe;
ſhe took <hi>Diana, Phillis, Celidea, Stella,</hi> and the reſt of the ſhepherdeſſes a part,
and propounded to them, that ſince the ſhepherds had already ſhewed their forwardneſs
in requeſting <hi>Adamas</hi> to offer this ſacrifice; it was fit they joyned with them in the ſame
deſires, and to try if they could carry him with them when they returned. Every one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of the motion; and after a conſultation, who amongſt them ſhould be their ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
it was agreed, that <hi>Diana</hi> ſhould be the mouth of the Company, which ſhe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of, though at the firſt ſhe made ſome difficulty. So then addreſſing themſelves unto
<hi>Alexis,</hi> they intimated unto her their deſires of ſpeaking unto the ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
that it might be by her meanes. <hi>Alexis</hi> never asking what the buſineſſe was, went
preſently unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> letting him know the deſires of theſe diſcreet ſhepherdeſſes.
Then <hi>Diana</hi> in the Name of all her Companions, delivered their Petition in very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
terms. And added thereunto, that they would eſteem it as a high favour, if he would
be pleaſed without any longer delay, to go now along with them; alſo did humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
him, to let the fair Druid his Daughter, and the Nimph <hi>Leonide,</hi> honour the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
with their preſence.</p>
                     <p>Unto which ſupplication, they received this Anſwer from the Druid: Fair and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
ſhepheardeſſes, your requeſt is ſo juſt, and I am obliged ſo much to ſee the honour of
the great <hi>Tautates</hi> performed, that upon one condition, I am ready to do as you deſire, I
am moſt confident anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> that there is none here, who are not pleaſed with
any thing you ſhall be pleaſed to command. I deſire then, replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> that you
will ſtay with me all this day, that I may take order for all things neceſſary for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and I promiſe you that to morrow I will conduct you to your Town: And I
ſhall moſt humbly deſire, that this Lady (ſaid he, and addreſſed himſelfe unto <hi>Daphniae</hi>)
will do us ſo far honour, as to be an aſſiſtant at this ſacrifice of Thanks, as well to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this honour unto our great <hi>Tautates,</hi> as to oblige us all, in not parting ſo much good
Company. The condition upon which our Petition depends, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> is ſo much
unto our advantage, as we cannot deſire a more noble favour.</p>
                     <p>Thus the voyage of <hi>Adamas</hi> was concluded upon, and he at the ſame time in order to
his promiſe, beſeech'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the fair <hi>Daphnide</hi> ſhe would be pleaſed to be an aſſiſtant, which ſhe
freely conſented unto, as well out of her complacency, as out of her great deſires to ſee
the manner how theſe ſhepherds and ſhepheardeſſes do live, of whom ſhe heard ſo much.
<hi>Alexis</hi> was a little ſtartled at her returning unto her Town, being ſtill in extream feares
of being known: Yet ſeeing it was a thing reſolved upon, ſhe diſſembled her feares as
well as ſhe could. <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> after thankes returned unto the Druid for this great favour, ſhe
came to rejoyce with <hi>Alexis,</hi> becauſe they ſhould enjoy her company a long time. 'Tis
I, fair ſhepherdeſſe, replyed <hi>Alexis,</hi> who ought to rejoyce the moſt, and, who can moſt
truly ſay, that I was never better pleaſed at any thing, ſince I came from the place where
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53527:53"/>
I had my education, than I am in my contentments of ſeeing you. Madam, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
heaven forbid I ſhould ever doubt of any thing you ſay: but I muſt needs confeſſe that if
I could, it is of this, becauſe I can hardly perſwade my ſelfe that I, inconſiderable I, who
am ſo very unfortunate, ſhould have any thing in me, which can merit, or which is
capable of receiving ſo high a favour.</p>
                     <p>Faire ſhepherdeſſe, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> you may very well beleeve what I ſaid, for I
never uſe to lie, and beleeve it alſo, that I had rather dye than either lye or diſſemble unto
you whom I love ſo well. Does it pleaſe you then Madam, replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that I ſhould
beleeve it ſo? Not onely pleaſe me, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> but I doe infinitely deſire it with all my
heart. Then Madam, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I would with all my heart alſo, it would pleaſe you
to let me live with you as long as I live, which if you doe, you will make me the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt contented woman in the whole Univerſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> and tooke her hand, I am affraid you will quickly repent of this
reſolution: Did you Madam but know <hi>Aſtreas</hi> humour, replyed the ſhepherdeſſe, you
would never thinke ſo, for ſhe is of ſuch a Nature that never alters a reſolution once
taken. <hi>Alexis</hi> upon this ſtood ſtill and ſpoke not, and going a pace or two backe, did
looke upon her with the ſame eye ſhe did, when ſhe commanded her never to ſee her again,
and this thought did ſo freſhly bring into her mind all former paſſages, as it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for her not to give ſome knowledge of her ſelfe, by the teares which trickled from her
eyes, which yet ſhe had ſo much power over her ſelfe as to reſtraine after a few drops.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſeeing ſuch a ſudden alteration in her, was much aſtoniſhed, as not being able
to imagine the cauſe, nor conceive that any thing ſhe had ſaid could poſſibly diſpleaſe her:
And in this perplexity they both ſtood a long while ſpeechleſſe; at laſt the ſhepherdeſſe
was the firſt who began to ſpeake: Madam, ſaid ſhe unto her, I ſee that you are changed
upon a ſudden, and I cannot poſſibly chuſe but be exceedingly troubled at it; if I be the
cauſe, either by my diſcourſe, or otherwiſe, I doe vow by that ſoule which loves you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the World, that I will preſently be revenged upon my ſelfe for it; if I be not, then
tell me I beſeech you, if my life can doe you any ſervice, and you ſhall ſee there is nothing
ſo deare unto me, which I would not ſacrifice unto it. <hi>Alexis,</hi> knowing her fault, and
checking her ſelfe; did endeavour to excuſe and hide it as well as ſhe could, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with a deepe ſigh, ſhe anſwered thus; Tis true, faire ſhepherdeſſe, that the alteration
which you obſerved in my face, did proceed from you, and yet you are not to be blamed,
but onely my owne ſoule, which is too ſenſible of a thing which your words did bring
into my memory: And to give ſatisfaction unto your perplexity, you muſt know, that
I being brought up amongſt the Virgin Druids of <hi>Carnutes,</hi> amongſt the multitude that
was there, I made choice of one, whom above all the reſt ſeemed unto me moſt amiable,
and thought my ſelfe not miſtaken in my choice, ſhe being eſteemed ſo amongſt all our
Companions, and having all deſirable qualities which uſe to create love: She was faire,
hanſome, and as well extracted as any in all the Country, her wit was ſutable to the
perfections of her body, everyway accompliſhed, and all her actions were ſweetned
with affability and civility; her ſweetneſſe flowed ſo upon me, that I loved her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I thought ſhe loved me, I loved her extreamly, and this love came to that height
betwixt us, that I could not live without her, nor ſhe without me: Thus we paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
many yeares with abundance of content and ſatisfaction from each other; but whilſt
I thought my ſelfe more happy in this condition of friendſhip, than the greateſt Monarch
can be of his Dominions, this faire one quitted me, and ſo ſeperated her ſelfe from all
termes of friendſhip with me, as ſhe would never ſee me againe, and without ever telling
any cauſe fell into ſuch hatred of me as ſhe would never come neere me</p>
                     <p>My perplexity at this alteration was ſo great, and the blow ſo ſenſible, as I becoming
all ſorrow, I fell ſicke, and ſo dangerouſly, as I beleeve you have heard, that I thought
I ſhould never recover it. Now when you fell into expreſſion of your conſtant and unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
humour, I remembred the like expreſſions which this faire and wiſe Virgin uſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, and which were ſo ill obſerved, and this cauſed the alteration which you obſerved
in my countenance. Madam, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I am ſorry that I ſhould be any way the cauſe
of your perplexity; but I hope you will thinke me innocent, for had I knowne it, I
would never have committed this fault: But who would ever have thought, that you
who are ſo faire and full of all perfections, enough to invite and keep the whole world in
love with you, ſhould ever find a woman ſo ſimple and inconſiderate, as to let a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53527:53"/>
voluntarily eſcape her hands, which every one ought to deſire and covet? Oh God!
Oh Heavens! Oh all thats ſacred! how carefull ſhould I be in keeping ſo great a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
if Heaven beyond my merit ſhould ever raiſe me to ſo high a fortune? And with
how much carefull aſſiduity ſhould I court it, if by my care, paines, and travell I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hopes to obtaine it? But Heaven, which has looked upon me with a frowning eye ever
ſince I was borne, will I feare never be ſo favourable to me as long as I live. Faire ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe,
ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi> then, let me intreat you, that unleſſe you will exceedingly diſoblige
me, accuſe not this faire and wiſe Virgin of any crime in treating me after this manner:
For I cannot endure without much diſpleaſure ſhe ſhould ever receive any blame, for that
which is only my fault, and the ill influence of that planet under which I was born. And as
to your deſire of my ſucceeding in her place, beleeve it <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> it is I that would covet it with
any Art, but for one thing which gives me a checke. And moſt aſſuredly were it not for
that conſideration, my deſires of it ſhould exceed yours But, faire ſhepherdeſſe I fear, that
though now at the firſt, you judge me worthy of your amity, yet when you do particularly
know me, your judgement will find it ſelfe miſtaken, and looke aſquint at me as this faire
and wiſe one did, whoſe loſſe I doe ſo ſadly reſent; and if ſuch a fatall chance ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
me I know not what would become of poore <hi>Alexis,</hi> being able to ſay, and truly,
that I doe find my ſelfe ſo weake againſt ſuch fatall blowes, as I know not whether my
life will laſt after I have received them. And ſince it hath pleaſed the great <hi>Tautates</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
me from the danger of the laſt. I muſt confeſſe that my feares of falling into the like,
makes me tremble, and turnes my blood to ice. It does not pleaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> you Madam, replyed
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I ſhould ſay that this faire one was to blame in treating you thus, and therefore
becauſe I will not upon any conſideration whatſoever diſpleaſe you, I will not ſay it; but by
your permiſſion I will ſay, that ſhe will never find ſuch a jewell as ſhe has loſt; and that
if <hi>Tautates</hi> as a moſt particular bleſſing would preferre me unto her roome, I would not
part from it for a thouſand worlds. Ah faire ſhepherdeſſe, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> and ſighed, if ſuch
a happineſſe ſhould befall me, I ſhould vaule your amity at as a high rate, as you can mine:
But beleeve me faire one, you know not what you deſire, when you deſire my amity. I
confeſſe Madam, what you ſay, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> for the happineſſe which I deſire is ſo
high, as the weakneſſe of my underſtanding is not of capacity to comprehend it: But
Madam, ſince it is not the meaneſſe of my merit, what is it which hinders you from
doing me this high favour, ſince I doe call <hi>Tautates</hi> to witneſſe, that if I be ſo happy as
to obtaine it, I will preſerve it deerer than my life; nay, even that life which would be
an infinite happineſſe, if you thinke me worthy of it. <hi>Alexis</hi> upon this, ſwelling with
contentment, ſhe tooke her hand, and graſping it a little, ſaid unto her; faire ſhepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe,
remember where we leave this diſcourſe, and we will finiſh it to morrow, as we
goe unto your Towne; in the mean time, be aſſured that I have a greater inclination and
will to love you and ſerve you, than you can tell how to deſire.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why <hi>Alexis</hi> referred this diſcourſe untill another time was, leaſt lookers
on ſhould have any ſuſpition, had it continued longer; beſides, ſhe could not there hide
her bluſhes and alterations in her face, as ſhe hoped to doe by the way, when every one
would imploy their eyes in looking at their feet, and chuſing the way: And beſides that,
ſhe intended to adviſe with <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Leonide</hi> what to doe upon this occaſion: And
by fortune, <hi>Hylas,</hi> as if he had been ſome expreſſe Envoy, came to interrupt their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, if you continue talking thus long with this ſhepherdeſſe, I
ſhall beleeve you thinke the ſhepherdeſſes of this Country more amiable than the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds.
Never doubt that, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> and lay the blame only upon Nature which inclines
every thing to love its like; but Servant be not angry nor troubled at it, for I have love
enough for you yet. I thought, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> that being brought up amongſt the Druids
and learned Virgins, you had knowne the Lawes of Nature better than you doe; but
ſince you come from amongſt them ſo ignorant, I will inſtruct you Miſtreſſe a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than they have done. Perhaps Servant, anſwered ſhe, and ſmiled, you will loſe both
your time and your paines as well as they; and therefore I adviſe you to let it alone: Yet
I cannot endure the wrong you have done me, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> without complaint, ſince
you will not be told of your faults and inſtructed in your errours. I ſhould be ſorry, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis,</hi>
that <hi>Hylas</hi> ſhould complain of me in earneſt, but I hope he is onely in jeſt. How
can you thinke I ſhould chuſe but be angry? replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> when I heare you ſay that
you have love enough yet left for me, after you have loved theſe ſhepherdeſſes? It ſeemes
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53527:54"/>
I muſt be contented with the refuſe of others, and take what they leave: I do expect,
Miſtreſſe, that they ſhould have what I leave, and all reaſon requires it ſo. If that be it
which angers you, replyed <hi>Alexis,</hi> and ſmiled, we ſhall make all ſtraight. I will divide
my amity into two, one half ſhall be to love ſhepherdeſſes, and the other ſhepherds; and
amongſt all the ſhepherds you ſhall be in the firſt place. But of theſe two parts, ſaid <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
Which ſhall be the prime and the greater? There is no queſtion, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi>
but it muſt be that which is to be imployed amongſt ſhepherdeſſes; and with reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of ſhepherds, you are the onely one whom I will love: and of ſhepherdeſſes, there
is not one whom I will not love and ſerve. Then (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) I muſt confeſſe you are
in the right, and that I am too blame for accuſing you of ignorance, ſince I ſee you are
more knowing then even <hi>Silvander</hi> is.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt they were talking thus, the reſt of the company were diſcourſing upon ſeverall
ſubjects in the Great Chamber; and <hi>Phillis</hi> who had her eye continually upon <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
ſeeing <hi>Calidon</hi> going towards her, and knowing he had a deſigne of particular diſcourſe
with her, ſhe advanced to interrupt them, and left <hi>Silvander</hi> alone with <hi>Diana;</hi> for as
fortune was, <hi>Paris</hi> deſiring to conſult with <hi>Leonide,</hi> he was gone with her to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
ſo as <hi>Silvander</hi> had the opportunity of coming nearer this ſhepheardeſſe, with whom
<hi>Phillis</hi> alwayes ſtayed, until <hi>Calidon</hi> cauſed her to go away: And becauſe there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
conteſts between them, Miſtreſs (ſaid ſhe as ſhe went away) I would not have you
think me jealous, ſo as I dare not leave this ſhepherd with you; for I am ſo confident of
my good fortune, and of his ſhallow merit, as I do not at all fear him: And to ſhew the
truth of my words, I will leave you both together, whilſt I go and helpe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> in a great
Combate which I ſee ſhe is preparing for, againſt an approaching enemy; ſo without ſtay
for any anſwer, ſhe went towards <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who imagining the occaſion of her coming, took
her by the hand, and pulled her ſo near, as <hi>Calion</hi> could not well accoſt her. But that
young ſhepherd who was really wounded with the beauty of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> could not forbeare
from coming to her: and becauſe his addreſſes unto her were known unto <hi>Phocion,</hi> who
liked very well of it, and was adviſed unto it by <hi>Thamires,</hi> he thought it no matter,
though he ſpoke unto this ſhepherdeſſe in the preſence of any other; and that <hi>Phillis</hi>
perhaps would help him out in the declaration of his minde, becauſe ſhe might think it a
match advantagious to her companion. <hi>Phocion</hi> had already declared himſelfe to be of
the ſame judgement, who was held to be one of the wiſeſt Paſtors of his time, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
unto the ſhepherdeſſe, and who ſince the death of her Father and Mother, had ever as
much care of her, as if ſhe had been his Daughter.</p>
                     <p>Approaching therefore with this aſſurance unto this faire ſhepherdeſſe; Shall I not be
too troubleſome (ſaid he unto her after a ſalute) if uncall'd, I make a third in your
Councell? Never <hi>Calidon,</hi> anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for he cannot be troubleſome in what place
ſo ere he comes, eſpecially unto us who highly eſteem him: I could wiſh, anſwered the
ſhepherd, that this Epithete of Eſteem, had been changed into Love. Sometimes we doe
wiſh (ſaid the ſhepherdeſſe) things that are prejudicial unto others, and not advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to our ſelves. I do believe (ſaid <hi>Calidon</hi>) that what you are pleaſed to ſay, may fall
out in any other occaſion ſooner than in this which preſents it ſelfe. For, fair ſhepherdeſs,
give me leave to tell you, that you may believe, my deſires are not diſadvantageous to
you, ſince the ſaid <hi>Phocion</hi> is of another judgement: <hi>Phocion,</hi> who in prudence and
wiſdome, is reputed for the Oracle amongſt all the ſhepherds of this Country, and who
did me the honour to grant my requeſt which I made unto him by <hi>Thamires.</hi> Alſo, to
ſay it is any prejudice unto my ſelfe, it cannot be, for on the contrary I ſhall never enjoy
contentment until it be brought to paſſe. I cannot tell (replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> with a little an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in her eye) what the requeſt whereof you ſpeak may be; But if it be any thing that
concerns me, there is none who either ought or can promiſe any thing for me againſt my
will and conſent, ſince my Father and my Mother, to my ſad misfortune, are both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away. And as to what you ſay concerning <hi>Phocion,</hi> you cannot tell me any thing
of his prudence and wiſdome, more then I do know; but this does not conclude him
and I to be both of the ſame judgement: and though that his may be the better, yet it
muſt be ſome time before I can conſent unto it Alſo to tell you truly, I do believe that
if this wiſe Paſtor did know my mind, he would quickly change his opinion; and that is
it, which makes me entreat you to change yours; for if you do continue in it, beſides the
doing of your ſelf no good, it will draw much diſcontent both upon your ſelfe, and me.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53527:54"/>
Fair ones, replyed <hi>Calidon,</hi> are like unto Gods, they will be overcome by ſupplications.
I cannot tell what fair ones you meane, replyed <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> but I am moſt ſure, that neither
your words, nor your prayers, will ever obtaine any thing from me that will pleaſe you.
Perhaps, ſaid he, that when you ſee me even ready to die before your faire face, you will
not be ſo extreamly cruel as to let no pitty be found amongſt ſo much beauty. If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you will make me believe, that you think you are ſtill talking to
the fair <hi>Celidea.</hi> But <hi>Calidon,</hi> to be free and plain with you; ſince death hath taken from
me, him whom I deſired, I will never give death ſo much advantage as to deſire any more;
do not think but that I do eſteem and honour your merit, as much as I do any ſhepherd in
the Country: I do acknowledge my ſelfe obliged unto you for this addreſſe, but never
thinke that theſe conſiderations, or any other whatſoever, can ever make me alter my
will: And take this as a Doom written by immutable deſtiny. <hi>Since</hi> Aſtrea <hi>hath loſt her
firſt Love, ſhe ſhall not love any other but</hi> Tautates, <hi>unto whoſe ſervice ſhe ſhall devote
all the reſt of her life.</hi> Conſider this <hi>Calidon,</hi> and believe this Prophecy, which if you
doe not, time will tell you how true it is, and make you repent of your incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>This Anſwer was ſo reſolute, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> amazed the ſhepherd, ſo as ſhe ſtroke him
dum, and could not reply; and the ſhepherdeſſe ſeeing him in ſuch a confuſion, ſhe roſe
up and left <hi>Phillis</hi> in her room: Then ſhe went towards <hi>Alexis,</hi> who ſeeing her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and knowing by her looks that ſhe was troubled, ſhe left <hi>Hylas</hi> to aske her what the
matter was. Madam, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi> unto her, with a ſmile mixed with diſdaine, you may
think that it is eaſie for me to ſupport my burthen, but I was never more weary of it in
all my life; for the importunities of theſe Lovers are abominably troubleſome. <hi>Calidon</hi>
knows how to chuſe his time, and he knowes how well diſcourſes of Love does pleaſe
me: I adviſed him to continue, if he did intend to loſe his labour and his time, and that
perhaps he thought he was ſpeaking unto <hi>Celidea.</hi> Then ſhe related unto the Druid all
the diſcourſe, and the anſwer ſhe had given him, with ſo much paſſion, as <hi>Alexis</hi> ſaw that
there was no feare of this Rival.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Silvander</hi> was with <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhe ſat, and he kneeled, and ſo over-joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſee himſelfe with her, in the abſence of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> as he could not be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
enough to Love for ſo great a favour. Miſtreſſe, ſaid he unto her, How ſhall I begin to
thank you for this high favour, in ſtaying here with me, whereas you might ſpend the
time in talk with theſe kind ſhepherds, and fair ſhepherdeſſes? <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid ſhe, though
I would oblige you, yet in this I do not do it ſo much as you ſay; for I am confident
there is none in all the company, who would not be glad to change places with me: and
I ſweare ſhepherd, that I think my ſelfe ſo well, as I would not with them. Did I think,
replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> that your heart is conſentant to the harmony of your tongue, I ſhould
think my ſelfe the happieſt ſhepherd in the Univerſe. If that be all thats wanting to make
you happy, replyed ſhe, be confident <hi>Silvander,</hi> that then you are as happy as you can
wiſh. What aſſurance, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> can I have of it? You are a perſon of ſo much
judgement, anſwered the ſhepherdeſſe, as you will quickly find the truth of it, if you
will but be pleaſed to look for it; or if you could not, what elſe, do you think could ſtay
me here? I could find excuſes in abundance to go away; But I rather fear, <hi>Silvander,</hi> that
I am wearyſome to you, and that it is onely civility which keeps you here with me:
Faireſt Miſtreſſe, ſaid <hi>Silvander</hi> preſently, This exceſs of kindneſſe which you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſhew me, does but offend me, ſince if you have that opinion of me, or think me a
man of ſo weak a judgement, you doe a manifeſt wrong unto your and my affection;
for certainly I were a man without common ſenſe, if I did not ſee the perfections of the
faire <hi>Diana,</hi> which every one that ſees, confeſſes, and admires. Is it poſſible that <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
ſhould be the onely man that is blind? Can he not ſee the Sun when it ſhines? But
the truth is, I am ſo dazled with ſo great a light when I am with you, as I have no eyes
but onely to ſee, nor ſpirit, but onely to adore divine <hi>Diana</hi> upon earth, whom I hold
tranſcendent to her in the heavens, ſince the one is ſurmounted in Glory by the Sun her
brother; but the other ſurpaſſeth all that is in the Univerſe. <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe
and ſmiled, I permit you to ſay what you will of me, who knows well enough
what I am: but who would ever have thought, that the wager which you undertook,
could inſpire you with ſuch fained expreſſions. But as to your wager with <hi>Phillis;</hi> how
long ſhepherd, muſt I be your Miſtreſſe? when muſt I change that Name to that of your
Judge? Thoſe expreſſions wherewith I am inſpired, replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> are ſo full of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53527:55"/>
reallity, as they have no dependance upon the wager: And as for the name of Miſtreſſe,
whereof you ſpeake: beleeve it faire <hi>Diana,</hi> that you may take the name of Judge when
you pleaſe, but never can ſhake off the name of Miſtreſſe, which not the wager, nor fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but your perfections and my affection have ſo juſtly gotten upon my ſoule. I have
formerly told you, replyed the ſhepherdeſſe, that I allow you to ſpeake thus untill the
wager be decided; but pray tell me, when ſhall we all three be diſcharged of this buſineſſe?
For it has continued ſo long that the term of three Months is almoſt doubled. For my part
ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> I ſhall neither prolong nor retard the time, being aſſured that come when
it will, I ſhal not alter my condition. Do not talk of the future, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> but with doubt,
ſince none but the gods can tell what it will produce, but tell me <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſhall we imploy
the afternoon in ending the difference? I conceive it a convenient opportunity, and we ſhall
have as good aſſiſtance, as we can deſire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvander</hi> knowing that he could not hope to live with her in ſuch freedome, when
this fiction was taken away, he made a ſtop, and did not returne an anſwer to the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe,
which ſhe perceiving how he was perplexed, it did the more aſſure her of his
affection; but feigning, as before accuſtomed; why do you not give me an anſwer, ſhepherd,
ſaid ſhe, would you have us take this convenient opportunity, or would you have it defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
untill to morrow when we are at our owne Town? See what a tractable Judge I am,
I refer it unto your will. My Judge, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> and ſmiled, before I give an anſwer
I beſeech you let ſome Articles paſſe betwixt us; promiſe me that your judgement ſhall
paſſe to my advantage, and that the thing which is moſt pleaſing to me, may not be
forbidden me, and then if you pleaſe I will receive your doome before I depart from this
place. My judgement, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhall be juſt; and as for the forbidding which you ſo
much feare, let me underſtand what you meane, and I will anſwer you. <hi>Silvander</hi> then
aſſuming a more ſerious looke: I never had the leaſt doubt, ſaid he, but that you would
be moſt juſt; but give me leave to tell you, that extream juſtice, is extreame injury; and
becauſe you deſire an expoſition upon my ſecond requeſt, I conceive Miſtreſſe, continued
he, and ſmiled, that it is beſt to defer the buſineſſe untill another time, to the end, I may
have the more time to informe my Judge: Upon this, they were interrupted by <hi>Adamas,</hi>
who invited <hi>Daphnide</hi> and the reſt of the company to goe and walke; for the heat of the
day being over, it was more pleaſant abroad than in the houſe. And moſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
being deſirous to take the Aire, the delightſomeneſſe of the place inviting them, they
all ſet forward, ſome ſinging, and others diſcourſing upon ſuch ſubjects as beſt pleaſed them.</p>
                     <p>The Cavalier who was cloſe by the Temple of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> taking the ſame way that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
went, he came preſent to the bridge of <hi>Botereux,</hi> and a little after to the height of
the Plaine which diſcovered the Caſtle, and great Cittie of <hi>Marcellies.</hi> The Country
ſeemed very delectable unto him: For on the one ſide he ſaw the fertile Hils of <hi>Couſant,</hi>
which from the tops to the bottomes were enricht with many Vineyards, and upon the
tops of all, great Woods, which Nature had placed there to fence them from bluſtering
winds; The Plaine extended it ſelfe as farre as <hi>Mont Briſon,</hi> and following thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
Hils enlarged it ſelfe towards <hi>Surida,</hi> Mount <hi>Round</hi> and <hi>Feurs,</hi> with ſo many
little Rivolets and Lakes, that the variety made the proſpect beyond imagination plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant:
And becauſe the way in which he was, conducted to <hi>Marcellies,</hi> and his face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that way, it was the firſt place his eye fell upon. The Caſtle, ſcituated upon the point
of a Rock, which made it obvious to the eye, and ſeen farre, did preſently bring into his
memory, the place where he firſt ſaw <hi>Madonthe:</hi> For its grandure, its Towers and
magnificence of ſtructure had a great reſemblance of the place where ſhe dwelt. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum
brought into his fancy the many pleaſing paſſages which formerly he had ſeen
with her, and the extream perplexities and ſorrows he had ſuſtained ſince his diſgrace: And
becauſe this compariſon could not chuſe but much trouble his mind, this poor Cavalier was
conſtrained to lite from his horſe, and reſt himſelf under the firſt ſhade he found, where lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Horſe with his Servant, he went under a ſhady tree, he lifted his eyes up to heaven,
&amp; ſtood ſo raviſhed in contemplation, as he could neither hear, nor ſee anything about him</p>
                     <p>The Servant, who did exceedingly love his Maſter, and was ſorry in his ſoule to ſee
what a miſerable life he lived, did heartily curſe love, and her that was the cauſe of it.
By fortune at the ſame time, hearing a voice, he began to liſten, and ſtepping a little
neerer ſaw a Cavalier complaining againſt the ingratitude and inconſtancy of a Lady.
And becauſe he thought this would be a good excuſe to make him retire from his ſad
thoughts. Sir, ſaid he unto him, hearken I beſeech you unto the Cavalier is ſinging who
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53527:55"/>
is neer you. Away, away, ſaid he, I care not for medling with the matters of another:
Doſt thou not thinke I have enough to doe with my owne? The buſineſſe of another,
Sir, replyed the Servant, may doe good if good uſe be made of them: Upon this they
hearkned, and heard the Cavalier ſinging a very invective ſong againſt his owne Lady,
and againſt all others.</p>
                     <p>The one Cavalier hearing the other blame all women againſt reaſon for the fault of one
was much offended againſt him for it, taxing him with indiſcretion and injuſtice: And
thinking that if he ſhould ſuffer it without revenge, and let ſuch blaſphemies paſſe unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
he ſhould commit a great fault againſt the faire <hi>Madonthe:</hi> And therefore he
would preſently make him eat his words, and cry mercy for the injurious language he had
uttered; but upon better conſideration he thought it more expedient to give him occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſeeking Combate; for, ſaid he, if he be couragious, he will reſent the offence I ſhall
give, and require ſatisfaction, and if he be a Coward, he is not worthy my fighting with
him. In this reſolution, the Cavalier roſe up, and turning towards the other Cavalier,
after he had a little conſidered what he ſhould ſay, he ſung in as loud, and diſtinct a voice
as he could, a ſong which intimated, That ſince he ſaw how inconſtant his Lady was,
it was his part either to die, or elſe cure himſelfe with diſdaine of her.</p>
                     <p>This being diſtinctly heard by the other Cavalier, he could not chuſe but thinke that
theſe words were intended againſt him. And being one of the moſt couragious Cavali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in all that Country, he tooke it for ſuch an affront, that without more adoe, he
pulled downe his Helmet (for he was armed <hi>Capape</hi>) and went through the Wood to
the place from whence the voice came.</p>
                     <p>The other, who expected to ſee what effects his anſwer would produce as ſoone as he
ſaw him coming, and being reſolved that if he did not reſent his words, he would adde
ſuch as ſhould provoke him to fight But the arrogance of him with whom he had to do
was ſuch, as he needed ſmall provocations, as well becauſe he was confident of his own
ſtrength &amp; skill, as becauſe he was Nephew unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> whoſe authority was ſo heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſince the departure of <hi>Clidemant</hi> and <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as he was neere the capacity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himſelfe abſolute Lord of the <hi>Seguſians.</hi> The name of this Cavalier was <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus;</hi>
he was taller than the common height, and ſo well proportioned every way, as it
was eaſie to judge him a man of great ſtrength and courage. He had long courted one of
<hi>Galatheas</hi> Nimphs, and whether it was true or no, I know not, but ſo it was, that he
thought ſhe loved him: her name was <hi>Silere,</hi> one that was very faire and highly hanſome;
but when he was urgent with her for ſome teſtimony of her good will, and when ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him, he according to his arrogant humour would needs uſe a kind of authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her; which ſhe taking very ill, ſhe choſe rather to break quite off with him, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer to endure his arrogancy. He ſeeing himſelfe deceived in his hopes, fell into
ſuch a paſſion of anger againſt her as he conceived an extreame hatred againſt all women
whatſoever for her ſake, and ever ſince, did vent the moſt bitter invectives againſt them,
that he could invent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argenteus</hi> then, according to his cuſtome, arrogantly approaching the other Cavalier
without any ſalute or action of civility, was it to me Cavalier (ſaid he) that you inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
your ſong. The Stranger who naturally could not put up any incivility, and being
already ill ſatisfied with him; Take it as you will, ſaid he unto him, I perceive by your
armes and your language, (ſaid <hi>Argenteus</hi>) that you are a Stranger: For did you know
me, you would give me another anſwer; but ſince it is ſo, either get upon your Horſe,
or elſe be as you are on foot, and I will make you know your folly and raſhneſſe. Then
loſe no time (ſaid the Stranger) but on foot let us end the difference: Upon this he ſtept
into the high way, he drew his ſword, and ſtood in ſuch a bold poſture that <hi>Argenteus</hi>
judged him to be a brave Cavalier.</p>
                     <p>When they were ready to begin fight, they heard a great noiſe of Horſes and Coaches,
which came from <hi>Marcelleis</hi> ſtraight towards them. This moved <hi>Damon</hi> to ſay, that
he thought it better to goe into the Wood, and let the Company paſſe, leaſt they ſhould
be interrupted: But <hi>Argenteus</hi> who did imagine that it was <hi>Galathea</hi> or <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and
was very deſirous to ſhew his valour: No, no, Cavalier, ſaid he, never let us hide our
ſelves but when we do ill, and therefore as you ſay, let us loſe no time, unleſſe your heart
faile you to maintaine your quarrell My quarrell, ſaid he is ſo juſt, that though in other
occaſions I had no courage, yet I ſhould in this, not only againſt you, but againſt all men
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53527:56"/>
living. But if as you ſay, ill actions ought to be hid, I know not a place dark enough to
hide yours, who maintaines a thing ſo unjuſt, and ſo unworthy the name of a Cavalier,
in blaming Ladies whom every Cavalier is obliged to maintain, ſerve, and defend. Alas
my good friend, ſaid <hi>Arganteus,</hi> and mocked him, how long have you been a high-way
Orator:<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is with this, ſaid he, and ſhewed him his ſword; that I uſe to ſpeak; and if
you have courage, you ſhall find that I can doe better then you can ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, they fell on very furiouſly, and as ſtout a Combate it was, as could be ſeen
betwixt two valiant Cavaliers: They were no ſooner warmed in the fight, but all the
company, whom they ſaw coming, arrived at the place: And becauſe the Combat was
in the high way, and every one knew <hi>Arganteus,</hi> they ſtopped to ſee what would be the
iſſue. <hi>Galathea,</hi> who was in the Coach with the Nymphs, did hate the arrogance of
<hi>Arganteus,</hi> and they all wiſhed he might be puniſhed for it by this ſtranger. But know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his great valour, ſtrength and skill, they were much afraid he would be too hard for
this unknown Gavalier, though his hanſome preſence and good beginning got him a
good opinion amongſt them. <hi>Galathea</hi> ſeeing <hi>Polemas</hi> near her Coach, called unto him,
and asked who it was which was fighting with <hi>Arganteus,</hi> and what was the cauſe of
the quarrel, and whether it were not beſt to part them? To which he anſwered, That it
was injurious to hinder them from ending their difference, ſince they fought upon equall
terms, and without treachery: And as to the Cavalier and their Quarrel, he could meet
with none that could inform him, but the ſervant unto the ſtranger. <hi>Polemas</hi> anſwered thus,
becauſe he was very confident in the valour of <hi>Arganteus,</hi> and that the ſtranger would
not be able to reſiſt him: and he was very deſirous that <hi>Galathea</hi> might ſee the valour
and courage of thoſe that had relation unto him. But ſhe according to the curioſity of
all Ladies, being deſirous to know who this ſtranger was, cauſed his ſervant to be called
unto her, whom ſhe asked who that ſtrange Cavalier was, and how the quarrell began.
The cauſe of their quarrel, Madam, anſwered he, is very juſt on my Maſters ſide; For he
hearing that other Cavalier ſpeaking very ill of all women, he could not endure it, as
thinking it againſt the honour of a Cavalier: But as for telling you who he is, I am
ſorry it is forbidden me; yet I aſſure my ſelfe, that as ſoon as the Combat is ended, he is
ſo civil as to ſatisfie your demands. <hi>Polemas</hi> laughed to hear him ſpeak thus, and in
mockery ſaid unto him; well ſaid my good friend, thou art in the right, when thou ſaidſt,
my Lady ſhould know, when the Combate is ended; for his Epitaph upon his Tomb will
tell her. Sir, ſaid the ſervant to him, if my Maſter had not come off a more dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
then this, he would never have been able to come ſo farre as he hath done upon
this he retired to the place where he ſtood before.</p>
                     <p>During this diſcourſe, the two Cavaliers continued the fight moſt furiouſly; and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
had ſuch a deſire to come off with honour, as there was not a by-ſtander, who did
not eſteem him a very brave Cavalier, eſpecially <hi>Galathea,</hi> and her Nymphs, in whoſe
eyes might their contentments be ſeen, when <hi>Damon</hi> got any advantage, which they
would not diſſemble though <hi>Polemas</hi> ſtood by, becauſe it was their cauſe in which he
fought.</p>
                     <p>It was now near half an hour ſince they firſt began blows, theirs Arms were broken and
ſhattered in ſeveral places, when <hi>Argantens</hi> felt himſelfe ſomething faint, and was not
ſo nimble, nor laid on ſuch vigorous blows. On the contrary, <hi>Damon</hi> did not onely
ſeem hearty and freſh, but did rather increaſe in vigour and agility, which did exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
trouble <hi>Polemas,</hi> but more <hi>Arganteus,</hi> who did now begin to eſteem his enemy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
highly; but preſenly after, the ſtrangers ſword did reach his body almoſt at every
blow, ſo as <hi>Arganteus</hi> fainted down right, either by reaſon of the loſſe of blood, or
greatneſſe of his wounds. Now <hi>Polemas</hi> did heartily repent that he did not part them
at the beginning of the Combate, and wiſhed that ſome good genius would move <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
to interrupt them: ſhe who perceived how <hi>Polemas</hi> was troubled, although ſhe did
not love him, yet would give him this ſatisfaction in reſpect of the ſervice he did her
Mother; and knowing no better way to part theſe Cavaliers, then by entreating them her
ſelfe, ſhe came out of her Coach, and withal her Nymphs came to the Combatants; At
the very ſame time <hi>Arganteus</hi> not being able to ſuſtaine himſelfe, fell on his knee, and
ſeemed as if at the ſight of theſe Ladies, he had done it purpoſely to ask them pardon
for the injury he had done unto women. But becauſe <hi>Polemas</hi> thought <hi>Galathea</hi> too
ſlow, and that his Nephew who drooped already, would be quite diſhonoured if he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53527:56"/>
any longer; he made a ſign unto ſome of his ſervants, who preſently gallopped, and
fell upon <hi>Damon,</hi> who never ſuſpecting ſuch treachery, nor had ſo much as looked back
but for the cry of <hi>Galathea</hi> and the Nimphs, towards whom turning his head, he ſaw
ſeven or eight Cavaliers coming towards him with ſwords in their hands, and menacing
him. All he could do, was to recoil unto his ſervant; but his courage was moſt high
and admirable ſince coming out of this Combate, after which he ſtood in need of reſt;
as ſoon as his ſervant brought him his Horſe, he vaulted into the ſaddle without any
ſtirrup; and he ſtood in need of all his agilitie to ſave himſelfe from the hurt they would
have done him; for he was no ſooner in his ſaddle, and the bridle in his hand, but he had
them all upon him, do what <hi>Galethea</hi> could, who was much terrified with all her Nimphs
amongſt all the horſes. As for <hi>Polemas,</hi> he faigned that he never ſaw the confuſion, being
with <hi>Arg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nteus,</hi> and taking order concerning him.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, theſe Cavaliers did ſo aſſault this ſtranger, as though at two blowes
he ſent two of them out of the Combat, yet could he not prevent a wound in his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and his horſe from being killed under him, with ſeveral blowes which they gave him
in his flank. The ſtranger perceiving him to faint under him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let go his ſtirrops, and jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
nimbly upon the ground, which helped him very well, for the Horſes of his enemies
would not come near unto his being dead; yet it was impoſſible to ſave himſelf long, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome unexpected helpe.</p>
                     <p>The Nimph who ſaw ſuch baſe injury done unto this Cavalier, and not being able to
endure it, ſhe cryed, and threatned the men of <hi>Polemas;</hi> but one amongſt their who
commanded the reſt, and to whom he had made a ſigne, knowing his maſters will, and
ſeeming as if he did not heare <hi>Galathea,</hi> did ſtill command them to kill the Cavalier;
when, as fortune was, one of the Lions of the Fountain of Loves Verity, ſeeking for his
prey came amongſt the horſes.</p>
                     <p>This Lion was ſo great and terrible, that all the Horſes when they ſaw him come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, took ſuch a fright, as there was neither Cavaliere nor Servant that could
be maſter of his own, but all ran away. That of <hi>Polemas</hi> and the ſtrangers ſervant, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the bridle in their teeths, they ran as far as the Town of <hi>Boen,</hi> no Bridge, no Gate, no
Hedge, nothing could ſtop them; thoſe that ſtayed with the Coaches, took ſuch a flight,
that they never ſtayed till they were above a league from the place, where they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned,
and all the Coaches and Harneſſes torne in pieces; ſo as it was a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to bring them back that day: as for <hi>Arganteus,</hi> they had ſet him on horſe-back,
but he was not able to hold himſelfe on, ſo as being forſaken by all thoſe who held him,
at the firſt ſtart of the horſe he fell down, and ſo unluckily, as he broke his neck: Thus
ended the proudeſt, and moſt arrogant Cavalier in all the Country, and his horſe by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
running away for fear, and almoſt over the ſtranger, he ran him through the body
with his ſword, and he fell down dead by his Maſter. The Nimph thanked God for this
encounter, for ſhe knew that the Lion would not doe any harme, being ſo inchanted as
he could not offend any, but thoſe who would try the adventure. And yet preſently after
ſhe was driven into feare; for the Lion who came onely to ſeek for his prey of food, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſtrangers horſe dead, he began to eat upon him: But the Cavaliere having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſo much good fortune from him, thought it a kind of ingratitude to ſeen him torn in
pieces without defending him; he went towards him with his ſword drawn, which the
Nimph ſeeing, and fearing leſt the Lion being provoked ſhould hurt him, ſhe cryed out,
and entreated him not to go any further: But he could not endure this indignity, he
went ſtraight to the Lion, but becauſe his back was towards him he would not ſtrike him
behind, and made him turne the other way: The furious beaſt, ſeeing himſelfe threatned
with a ſword, he leapt aſide, as if he would have run towards the Nimphs, which the
Cavalier fearing, he was much more exaſperated to interpoſe betwixt them, ſo as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
who was ſtill before him, began to roar out extreamly, beating his taile againſt the
ground, grinning with his teeth and ſparkling eyes, he ſeemed as if he would preſently
fall upon him, and but for the inthantment, doubtleſſe, he had; But that force being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
his, he was conſtrained to turne aboue, and went to feed upon the horſe of <hi>Argan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus,</hi>
of which after he was ſatisfied, he carried part of the reſt, according to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
unto the other Lion which guarded the Fountaine. The Cavaliere ſeeing the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
going towards <hi>Arganteus,</hi> and fearing leſt he ſhould devour his body, he ſtood by it,
and guarded it, not being willing the Corps of ſo crave a Cavalier ſhould be abuſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:53527:57"/>
But when he ſaw him gone, then he went to the Nymphs, who having beene Spectators
of all his generous actions did highly eſteem him. He addreſſed himſelf firſt unto <hi>Galathea</hi>
imagining it to be her, as well by her Majeſtical deportment, as by the honour which all did
doe unto her; and after civill ſalutation, he beſeeched her to pardon the inconveniency
which upon his occaſion ſhe had received.</p>
                     <p>I am very ſorry Sir for yours, anſwered ſhe, and extreamly angry againſt the indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe who have ſo unworthily and inconſiderately aſſaulted you in my preſence;
but I promiſe you, Sir, that beſides the correction which you have given them, I ſhall
cauſe them to be puniſhed according to their merits. Madam, anſwered the Cavalier, I
ſhould be very ſorry that any who are in your ſervice ſhould receive any diſpleaſure by
reaſon of me: I deſire rather to ſerve them all, and beg your favour upon them, Madam,
and beſeech you not to refuſe it at my requeſt Sir, ſaid ſhe, it muſt be you that muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them, ſince it is you whom they have offended; It is not the part of theſe Ladies
and my ſelfe to deny you any thing you ſhall pleaſe to aske, ſince you have ſo well defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us againſt this diſcourteous Cavalier; and would have defended us from the Lyon;
but we will ſpeake of this another time. In the interim I thinke you have received a
wound in your ſhoulder, it is requiſite the blood ſhould be ſtopped, untill we come to a
place where the wound may be dreſſed. The wound whereof you ſpeake Madam, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he, is but a ſcratch; and all that you pleaſe to ſay I have done for you, is farre ſhort
of what low, and which I would moſt willingly pay in your ſervice: But ſince all your
company is ſcattered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I beſeech you give me leave to conduct you unto ſome place of ſafty,
for I perceive this Country is not without very dangerous Beaſts, ſo as it is not ſafe to go
without good guard. <hi>Galathea</hi> ſmiled, and ſaid: I perceive Sir that you are a Stranger
ſince you doe not know this Lyon to be inchanted, ſo as he will doe no harm unto any
unleſſe unto ſuch who will try the adventure of the Fountaine which he guards, and had
you not provoked him, he would not ſo much as have looked towards us. I could not
endure, ſaid he, that he ſhould tear my Horſe in pieces before my face, much more that
Cavalier, who though indiſcreet, yet was very valiant and couragious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvia,</hi> who paſſed behind this Cavalier to looke upon his wound, tooke notice that
it bled ſtill which cauſed her to ſay unto <hi>Galathea;</hi> Madam, you talke too much unto
this Cavalier, for he bleeds very faſt: Then they went all unto him, and almoſt by force
bound up his wound with their Handkerchers and made him a Scarfe to hold up his arm.
Then <hi>Galathea</hi> conceived, that ſince their Coaches came not, that it was the beſt courſe
to walke gently unto <hi>Mount Verdan,</hi> where they might conveniently ſtay, doubting that
the Coaches were overturned and broken: And becauſe the way was but ſhort and very
faire, all the Nymphs approved of the motion; and therefore the Cavalier tooke <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
by one arme, and <hi>Silvia</hi> tooke her by the other; and all the reſt followed, diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon nothing elſe but the valour and merit of this Stranger: ſome extolled his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
others blamed the wrong that had beene done him; Some admired his boldneſſe,
and others could not highly enough eſteeme him for defending his dead Horſe, and his
intention to defend the Corps of <hi>Arganteus?</hi> But all deſired moſt paſſionately to know
who he was, ſuch extraordinary favour had his valour purchaſed him amongſt the
Ladies.</p>
                     <p>He had not yet pulled up his Helmet, and walked on as if he did not intend it; when
<hi>Silvia</hi> obſerving the curioſity of all her companions: Is it not ſtrange Madam, ſaid ſhe,
that we ſhould be ſo much obliged to this brave Cavalier, and neither know his Name
nor his face: If you pleaſe, we will make tryall of his courteſie as we have already of his
valour: for he walkes on with his Helmet downe as if he were yet in hand with <hi>Argan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus.</hi>
The Cavalier not ſtaying for <hi>Galatheas</hi> anſwer, anſwered: For my face, Madam,
it ſhall not be concealed from you if it pleaſe you; but as for my name, I beſeech you let
it be concealed ſtill, becauſe I am ſure you know it not. To which <hi>Galathea</hi> anſwered;
You may, noble Cavalier content us in both, if you pleaſe, and indeed you ought not to
make any difficulty of it: For ſince you ſay we doe not know it, you may ſhew it and
ſatisfie us, and yet it is no more known than before. I ſee Madam, replyed he, that it is
an eaſier thing to vanguiſh Cavaliers, be they never ſo valiant, than to defend ones ſelfe
againſt faire Ladies. I will therefore addreſſe my ſelfe unto ſupplications; and of two
things which you aske I will ſatisfie you in one preſently, and beſeech you to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>er the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
untill we come to <hi>Mount Verdan.</hi> It ſhall be then, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> upon condition
of granting one thing which I will aske you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:53527:57"/>
There is nothing Madam, which you can command, replyed the Cavalier which I will
not obey, and ſatisfie withall my power. Upon this, lifting up his Helme, he appeared
to be very faire, he was young, and his paines in the combate had put ſuch a freſh colour
in his cheekes, as none could by his face ſee the ſadneſſe of his ſoule; and this was the
reaſon, that all ſeeing him ſo very faire, they were the more impatient to know who he
was: And had they not ſeene the aged <hi>Cleontine</hi> coming with a great number of Virgin
Druids, with ſome of the <hi>Vaci</hi> and <hi>Eubagi</hi> moſt certainely they had gotten him, not
onely to tell his Name, but alſo what fortune brought him thither: But he anſwered,
how one ought never to deſpaire of aſſiſtance from heaven, eſpecially when one has right
on their ſide.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt they were talking thus, the ſage <hi>Cleontine</hi> was come ſo neer, as <hi>Galathea</hi> ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
a little before, received her in her armes, and held her ſo whilſt ſhe ſaid; What doe
you thinke Mother of the Equipage in which we come? I doe not thinke you expected us
in this manner I did not expect Madam, ſaid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> that you ſhould take ſo much
paines as to come ſo farre to ſee me, for when you have any ſervice for me, you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me to come unto you; but you doe honour our great <hi>Tautates</hi> in condeſcending
unto ſo much humility, as coming unto this ſacred place, where it pleaſeth him to render
Oracles. I muſt confeſſe, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that my deſign was to come hither, but not ſo ſoon.
Upon this <hi>Galathea</hi> ſaluted the Virgin Druids; and afterwards, continuing her way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Mount Verdan,</hi> and not ſeeing <hi>Celidea</hi> amongſt the reſt, ſhe asked where ſhe was:
Madam, ſaid ſhe unto her, never was a more happy marriage, than that between <hi>Thami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
and her; and I doe not thinke that any who ſees them but doe deſire to marry: And
what's become of <hi>Calidon,</hi> ſaid the Nymph: Oh Madam, anſwered <hi>Cleontine,</hi> he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured of the diſeaſe which ſhe cauſed in him, he has now no other thoughts but
of marrying <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> How, replyed the Nymph, will <hi>Calidon</hi> marry <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and is ſhe
conſenting? who is it that makes this match? It is, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Phocion,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
and <hi>Thamires,</hi> who is very ſolicitous in it, but I am affraid it will hardly be a match:
For <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is ſo averſe unto it, as they will have much adoe to get her conſent. And
why, ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi> does ſhe love any other Shepherd? We do not heare, replyed <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontine,</hi>
that ſhe loves any yet, for ſhe is too buſie in lamenting her loſſe of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and
erecting him a Tombe. What is become of that ſhepherd, ſaid the Nymph: I thinke
Madam, ſaid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> that about ſeven or eight Months ſince, he was drowned: And
why, ſaid the Nymph, doe they make him an empty Tombe? Becauſe Madam (ſaid
<hi>Cleontine</hi>) that the learned Sarronides and Druids tell us the ſpirit of him who dies, will
wander and walke many ages if thoſe who ſurvive doe not pay the office of Sepulture:
And becauſe the body of <hi>Celadon</hi> was not found, they erected him this empty Tombe of
which I told you: How, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> when he was drowned, and his body loſt,
was it never ſince found? Never Madam, ſaid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> that we could hear of, and it is
to be beleeved that all the ſhepherds about uſed all endeavours poſſible; for never was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſhepherd in this Country more beloved, nor any truly more deſerved it: And Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
had he been ſo happy as to be known unto you. I am confident you would have
thought him ſo. And as I hear, this ſhepherd had a long time beene a devoted ſervant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but carried the matter ſo cloſe and diſcreetly as none could perceive it; and
the leſſe becauſe it was unlikely ever any love ſhould be betwixt them by reaſon of an
inveterate enmity that had long been betwixt their Fathers: And becauſe cloſe and ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
love is alwayes moſt violent, probably ſo was theirs, both in that reſpect, and in
reſpect of both their merits: For I dare ſay Madam, and with abundance of truth that I
never in all my life ſaw a fairer nor more accompliſhed ſhepherdeſſe. Now <hi>Phocion,</hi> who
is her Uncle, and who, as next of kin, has the care of her, would gladly marry her unto
<hi>Calidon,</hi> who indeed is a very fine ſhepherd; but there is ſo much difference betwixt him
and <hi>Celadon,</hi> as it is very unlikely, that ſhepherdeſſe will ever conſent eſpecially having
yet <hi>Celadon</hi> ſo freſh in her memory; yet <hi>Calidon</hi> ſtill hopes, and keepes as cloſe to her as
poſſibly he can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for <hi>Thamires,</hi> he lives the moſt happily and beſt contented of any
man in the world, and ſayes that the ſcars of <hi>Celideas</hi> face being teſtimonies of her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
doe make her so faire and amiable, as he cannot deſire her otherwiſe; and in this
contentment, he is ſo well ſatisfied, as he cannot be an inch from her: I am very ſorry
ſhe is not here, that ſhe might have the honour of kiſſing your hand, as much disfigured
and ill favoured as ſhe is. But <hi>Aſtrea, Diana, Phillis,</hi> and other ſhepherdeſſes of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53527:58"/>
neighbouring Towns, are the cauſes of her miſſing this honour, having yeſterday invited
her to viſit the Daughter of <hi>Adamas,</hi> who is returned from the virgin Druids of <hi>Carnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and reputed one of the faireſt Ladies, and the moſt diſcreet in all the Country. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
ſaid <hi>Galathea, Celidea</hi> will return at night, then we may ſee her. I wiſh it, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
anſwered <hi>Cleontine;</hi> but I am afraid that <hi>Thamires</hi> who accompanies her, is the
cauſe of her ſtay; for it being late, he will not let her travell, becauſe he is extreamly
careful of her health; beſides, I know the venerable <hi>Chriſante</hi> will not let her part from
<hi>Bonlieu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Galathea,</hi> without ſeeming to take any great notice of things, gleaned from the
diſcourſe of <hi>Cleontine,</hi> all the ſtate of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and of his love; yet much wondring that
none ſhould know what was become of him. Then conſidering with her ſelfe that this
ſhepherd not being in this Country, ſhe was to blame in accuſing <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſhe intended
to call her unto her again, and in order thereunto reſolved to paſſe by the houſe of <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
as well to bring her away with her, as in hopes to meet <hi>Aſtrea</hi> there, of whom ſhe
had heard ſo much, to the end ſhe might judge, whether her beauty was ſuch as might
invite <hi>Celadon</hi> ſo much to ſlight hers. In theſe thoughts ſhe could not refraine from ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very loud, which <hi>Cleontine</hi> obſerving; Oh Madam, ſaid ſhe, why do you ſigh? Is there
any thing which troubles you? <hi>Galathea</hi> having no mind ſhe ſhould be the ſecretary of
her thoughts, anſwered her; I ſigh Mother, to think of <hi>Clidemant,</hi> you know where he
is, and there are many occaſions of danger to cauſe feare of his being well. It is many
dayes ſince either <hi>Amaſis</hi> or I heard from him; and of late the <hi>Vaci</hi> tell us, that when they
look into the intrals of the Victims, they find the moſt noble parts defective: Moreover,
I have had ſome very horrid Dreams, and believe it, theſe things much trouble me. My
Mother alſo, who is fuller of apprehenſions then I am, hath thought it fit we ſhould offer
ſome ſacrifices, and that I ſhould come to conſult with this Oracle, whether I intend to
come at my return from <hi>Bon-lieu,</hi> where I am going to offer ſome ſacrifices unto the Gods
in lieu of her, who this morning deſigned it her ſelfe, but being prevented by ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
and important buſineſſe, ſhe commanded me to go in her room. Madam, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſage <hi>Cleontine,</hi> our Great <hi>

doe call for chaſtiſements, he gives us advertiſement of it, to the end that the feare of
future evill may make us turn to him, and that with ſacrifices, ſupplications, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we do appeaſe his anger, and divert the puniſhments from us. And therefore, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
theſe advertiſements are not to be deſpiſed; for if they ſhould, it would make his
hand more havy upon us, for having ſo little care of his advice: Let <hi>Amaſis</hi> and you,
lay theſe things to your hearts, ſince it is to be believed they are not without great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Examine well all your actions, and if upon a ſtrict ſurvey you finde any that is
not good, reprove them your ſelves, and not tarry till <hi>Tautates</hi> make you more ſenſible
of them: Afterwards make a ſtrict inquiſition what is done in your houſe, and if you
find any offences in it, reform them ſo as they may be no more committed: Then let
your eye be over all the Country, and diligently inform your ſelves what abuſes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
and uſed there; chaſtife thoſe that are the Authors of them; for that ſtate
where vice goes unpuniſhed, and vertue unrewarded, is very near deſolation. Know Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that the Prince and the State are but one body, whereof the Prince is the head
And as all the paine which the body reſents does come from the head, ſo all the paine
which the head endures, does proceed from the body: My meaning is, that as <hi>Tautates</hi>
does chaſtiſe the people for the fault which the Prince commits, ſo he does puniſh the
Prince for thoſe which the people commit. This Madam is the counſell which I give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and which my profeſſion would not ſuffer me to be ſilent in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Galathea</hi> thanked the ſage <hi>Cleontine</hi> for her prudent and religious admonitions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
her, not onely to obſerve them her ſelfe, but to acquaint <hi>Amaſis</hi> with them, that
ſhe alſo might follow them: Afterwards, ſhe related unto her the accident which had
hapned, and how much it troubled her; for beſides the death of <hi>Argenteus,</hi> the inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Polemas</hi> in her preſence was very diſtaſteful to her, ſo as it wounded her to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſoul. Madam, anſwered <hi>Cleontine,</hi> ſuddain paſſions are often to be excuſed, becauſe they
are often not in our own power; and if we do not bear with one another in the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of our humanity, how ſhould we thinke <hi>Tautates</hi> will bear with us. But ſaid <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea,</hi>
for <hi>Polemas</hi> to doe thus unto a ſtranger, one that had right on his ſight, and in
my preſence; let me tell you Mother, that it is a boldneſſe which proceeds from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53527:58"/>
elſe then courage, and induceth me to thinke, that he who dares do theſe things
does think he may do ſomething which is worſe. Indeed, ſaid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> when a ſubject
does faile in that reſpect which he owes unto his ſoveraigne, he does it either out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in his judgement, or elſe becauſe he thinkes himſelfe ſo powerfull, that he feares not
not any diſpleaſure, and therefore it concerns him to take good heed.</p>
                     <p>With ſuch diſcourſe as this, they came to the houſe of the ſage <hi>Cleontine,</hi> into which
<hi>Galathea</hi> entred, as well to reſt ſelfe as to get the ſtrangers wounds dreſſed, unto whom
all the Nymphs could not do too much honour, nor ſhew too much demonſtration of
good will: eſpecially <hi>Silere,</hi> who when the time was, would have been ſorry for his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
before <hi>Arganteus</hi> tranſgreſſed the limits of his diſcretion; but ſince his love was
turned into diſdaine, ſhe fell into ſo great a hatred of him, as ſhe had courage to look on
him when he was dead, without beſtowing upon him one ſingle tear; ſo much did the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
injury deface the memory of all his paſt ſervices.</p>
                     <p>The Cavalier was preſently diſarmed, and ſearched by the Chyrurgions, who found
onely one wound in his ſhoulder, which was ſo ſlight that they made no matter of it,
onely advlſed him to keep his bed that day, by reaſon of the loſſe of blood. <hi>Galathea</hi>
deſiring to offer the ſacrifice which ſhe reſolved upon before ſhe went from the place, ſhe
ſent to provide bulls and other things neceſſary againſt the next morning: Alſo ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to enquire of the Oracle, and the Cavalier beſeeched her, that he might conſult
with the Oracle alſo, and joyn their ſacrifices together: She was pleaſed to gratifie him
ſo far, as to permit him, although it was not altogether the cuſtome: In the mean time,
they ſent out every way to enquire of their Coaches, and the ſervant of the unknowne
Cavalier.</p>
                     <p>After they had dined, and every one expected to heare ſome newes of thoſe that were
thus ſcattered, <hi>Galathea</hi> ſitting on the Cavaliers bed-ſide, and ſeeing all ſilent in the
Chamber, ſhe ſaid unto him; Although, ſir, we are much obliged to you for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
you undertook againſt the inſolent <hi>Arganteus,</hi> yet you are in one thing obliged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us; for when we entreated you to pull up your Helmet, and tell us your Name, and
what fortune brought you into this Country; you were pleaſed to ſatisfie us in letting
us ſee your face, but the coming of the ſage <hi>Cleontine</hi> hindred you from anſwering the
other part of our deſires; but ſince we have ſeen your face, it does the more inflame our
deſires of knowing unto whom we are ſo much obliged; and what was the cauſe of your
coming hither: And all this, that we may the better ſerve you in any way we are able.
Now is the time convenient; there is no feare of any prejudice to your wound, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we hope that you will ſatisfie our deſires. Madam, anſwered the Cavalier and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
Does the demanding of a thing make it a debt? Sir, replyed the Nymph, It is the
peculiar priviledge of Ladies in this Country; and you know that every one is obliged
to the obſervation of the Lawes belonging unto that Country wherein he is. 'Tis true,
Madam, ſaid he, but my greateſt difficulty is, not without reaſon; That I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
you ſhould take any delight in hearing the diſaſterous fortune of the moſt miſerable
Cavalier that lives, if it be <hi>living,</hi> to conſume his life amongſt all the miſfortunes and

                        </gap>hal. Let not this be any difficulty, ſaid <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
to him, ſince in acquainting us with your misfortunes, we are deſirous to ſerve you,
and may help you. Madam, ſaid he, If my misfortunes be contageous, we had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of reaſon to fear them. No, no, Sir, replyed ſhe; let every one beare their owne
burthen, and I am ſure there is none in all the company but thinkes their own the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt:
open therefore your wound unto us, ſometimes one may meet with another, who
is able to give unexpected remedy. It is not the hopes of any Remedy, replyed he, which
will move me to ſhew mine, for I know there is none but death: But it is onely, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
to obey you, and ſatisfie the curioſity of theſe Ladies: Then raiſing himſelf up a
a little in his bed, he began thus:</p>

I did not conſider, that thoſe who complaine and murmur are ſinners againſt the great
<hi>Tautates,</hi> as if we were not all his, and would not ſuffer him to have the free diſpoſition
of his owne, and all that is in the Univerſe: This conſideration has often tyed my

yet if in the violence of my paine it be permitted to let go ſome ſad ſighes, wonder
not Madam I beſeech you if in the ſequell of this diſcourſe you obſerve me ſending forth
ſome ſad ſighes at the memory of ſo many misfortunes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And beleeve, that if it were not
your expreſſe command, I ſhould not relate my miſerable life, the memory whereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuſe but make my wounds bleed afreſh.</p>
                     <p>Be pleaſed to know then, Madam, that my Country is <hi>Aquitane;</hi> I was educated by
King <hi>Thoriſmond,</hi> one of the greateſt Princes that ever reigned over the Viſigots: A Prince
ſo good and juſt, that he got the peoples love as much as if they were Viſigots. This
King raiſed his Court unto a higher pitch of glory than any other neighbouring Kings,
both by his arms, and the civility of thoſe that were about his Perſon: We were a jolly
company of young boyes brought up under him with as much care and indulgency, as if
we had beene his owne: Of this Volley was <hi>Alcidon, Cleomer, Cel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>das,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who all became very brave and gallant Cavaliers; it was my fate to be brought up
amongſt them, and I may ſay, that this education was the onely peece of good fortune
that ever I had. My Father, whoſe name was <hi>Beliantes,</hi> and who by his vertue was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
unto great Authority about <hi>Thierry,</hi> he left me an Orphan in my cradle, there begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fortune which ever ſince hath purſued me: For, not being willing I ſhould ever
arrive unto that credit which my Father had gotten, ſhe deprived me of it when I was
ſucking my Mothers breſt, and preſently after tooke away my mother alſo, and made
me mourn in my cradle.</p>
                     <p>At my coming out of my infancy, I caſt my eyes upon a faire Lady, whoſe name I
deſire to conceale, as well as my owne, becauſe I would not diſcover all my miſery. Nay,
nay, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> we muſt needs know both her name, and yours alſo; for there is
nothing you can tell us which we more deſire. Then, ſaid he my name is <hi>Damon,</hi> and
hers <hi>Madonthe.</hi> How, replyed the Nymph preſently; <hi>Damon</hi> who ſerved <hi>Madonthe,</hi>
Daughter unto the great Captaine of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Amorant,</hi> and killed
in the Battle of <hi>Attila</hi> upon the body of the valiant King <hi>Thyerry,</hi> and whom <hi>Leontidas</hi>
would have married to his Nephew? Are you that <hi>Damon,</hi> who out of jealouſie fought
with <hi>Therſander</hi> a little before the death of <hi>Thoriſmond?</hi> I am the very ſame <hi>Damon</hi> of
whom you ſpeake, replyed he, that is the moſt unfortunate Cavalier that lives, or ever
did live: You doe infinitely aſtoniſh me, ſaid ſhe, for every one beleeves you to be long
ſince dead, and that you ſent your ſervant with a Hankercher full of your blood, unto
your Miſtreſſe, or rather unto the wicked <hi>Leriana,</hi> as a teſtimony of your death. Tis
true, replyed the Cavalier with a deep ſigh, but fortune intending to perſecute me more
yet, would not let me go ſo good a way: Truly, ſaid the Nymph, many are deceived;
for the opinion of your death is ſpread all the Country over, and nothing is thought more
certaine.</p>
                     <p>I do remember, that when the newes of your death came hither, and relation was made
of your Love, of your Jealouſie, and of your death, many did pitty you, not only becauſe
you were dead by ſo ill a way, but becauſe you did not live to ſee the revenge which
was upon the wicked <hi>Leriana,</hi> every one thinking that your fidelity and your affection
did merit ſo much ſatisfaction before you dyed, as to know the innocency of the poore
<hi>Madonthe.</hi> But how was it poſſible you ſhould be ſaved from that moſt deſperate danger?
Madam, anſwered the Cavalier, ſince I perceive you are informed of all paſſages as well
as my ſelfe, I will only relate unto you what hath chanced unto me ſince my combate with
<hi>Therſander,</hi> and ſo abridge a great part of my dyſaſtrous life.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, I received in the combate which I had with <hi>Therſander</hi> very many
wounds, and amongſt the reſt two very great ones, which put me into good hopes of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53527:59"/>
dying, having no deſire to live, ſince ſhe for whoſe ſake onely my life was deer unto me
had ſo cruelly betrayed me. In that deſigne, I took the blindeſt way I could chuſe, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that when my blood failed me, I ſhould end this miſerable life; and in this reſolution,
when I found my ſelfe begin to faint, I commanded <hi>Hall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>dine</hi> my ſervant to carry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Madonthe</hi> the Ring which I tooke from <hi>Therſander,</hi> and unto <hi>Leriana</hi> my Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
full of my blood: The one, to ſhew unto her whom I loved, that ſhe was to blame
in preferring one before me, who did leſſe deſerve it, and the other to glut the cruelty
of <hi>Leriana.</hi> I perceived by the anſwer which <hi>Halladine</hi> gave me, that if I had followed
his directions he would have gotten me unto ſome place where wholeſome remedies might
have hindred me from what I deſired, my death.</p>
                     <p>This conceit, and finding my ſelfe faint, did make me ſtrive to get unto the River of
<hi>Garrone,</hi> and by chance I came unto a place where the bank was very ſteep, and under it
ſo full of points of little Rocks, that I thought when I fell I ſhould certainly be daſhed in
pieces before I came to the water; but my faithfull Servant whoſe eye was never off me,
perceived my deſigne, as I thinke by my eyes which perhaps were ſtartled at the horrour
of death, and to prevent it, ſtepped neerer, and catched hold of me. But ſee Madam, what
a man will doe that is reſolved to dye: I forced my ſelfe ſo ſuddenly and vigorouſly from
him, as I fell, and never touched any of thoſe ſharp Rocks, becauſe I over leaped them:
Thus Fortune was pleaſed to ſave me againſt my will, and my extreame deſire of dying
may be ſaid to be the cauſe of my not dying. My Servant cryed, and ran preſently about
to looke for me at the bottome, and finding me neere the ſide, he took hold of me; but
the ſtream was ſo ſtrong as it pulled him into the water after me, and it was a very mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
that he eſcaped drowning, for the place was ſo full of weeds as his feet were intangled
in them; but it is to ſhew others that the Gods never forſake thoſe as are faithfull to their
Maſters; he was ſo intangled that he loſt me, and knew not what was become of me, for
I being further in the water than he, the ſtream was ſo ſtrong and impetuous, as it carried
me away, ſometimes under, and ſometimes above the water, neer halfe a mile from the
place; and doubtleſſe I had beene carryed into the Sea, had I not been ſtopped by ſome
Fiſhermen, who by fortune were upon the River in their little boats: They ſpyed me
afar off, and not knowing at the firſt what it was; a deſire of gain moved them to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
ſome one way, and others another, to be ſure of catching me; but when I was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
neerer them, they plainly ſaw that I was a man; and then, beſides aſſurance of booty,
a charitable diſpoſition moved them unto their beſt endeavours, and with a long hooke
catched hold of my clothes, and then pulling me into one of their little boats, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me on ſhore, where laying me along upon the ſand, and ſtripping me, they perceived
that I had ſeverall wounds, and that they were freſh; at this they were much aſtoniſhed,
and much more when rifling my pockets, they found a good quantity of money, and on
my fingers three or four Rings of good value: Upon which, one of them ſaid, that this
day was either their enriching for ever, or elſe their utter undoing: For, ſaid he, here
is riches enough to ſerve us all as long as we live: But if ever this come to the eares of
juſtice, it will be ſaid that we killed him, and condemne us for not revealing it; ſo as if
we conceale it we are made for ever, and if revealed we are all undone, all of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the ſame, and knew not what courſe to reſolve upon; at laſt, one of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a little more reſolution than the reſt: Brothers, ſaid he, let us bury him, let us ſhare
and keep the riches which <hi>Tautates</hi> hath ſent us, &amp; not reveal it unto ſuch as who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
will take them from us; we know that we are not guilty of this miſhap, and ſince
we are not, be aſſured that God will protect the innocent, and therefore let us divide
what we have found, and live happily all our dayes after it.</p>
                     <p>As ſoone as this motion was made, it was conſented unto by the reſt, and preſently
they fell to divide, but in the firſt place they made a grave, in which they would inter
me, and till then would not divide, to the end every one ſhould worke at it with the
better will.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt they were thus buſied, there was an old Druid, who ſeeing theſe Fiſhermen
afar off, he had an opinion that they were dividing their Fiſh; this Druid was a holy man,
lived a very godly and exemplary life, and faſted almoſt every day and therefore he was lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
honoured and reverenced by every one. This grave old Druide, had in his younger
dayes followed the gliſtering follies of the world, as others did; but having found them
all to be but empty pleaſures, he retired himſelfe from the frequent ſociety of men, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53527:60"/>
lived in a little Cabin upon the top of a Rocke cloſe beſides this River, and that he
might the more freely be devoted unto his contemplation, he deveſted himſelfe from a good
eſtate which was deſcended unto him from his Anceſtors an action which brought him
ſo much eſteem in all the Country, as he was reputed, loved and feared as a ſacred Servant,
and reall friend unto <hi>Tautates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Druid then, ſpying theſe fiſhermen digging in the ground, he came unto them, and
they were ſo buſie at work, as he was very near them before they ſaw him, and ſo near,
as he could ſee a naked body, riffled from its clothes; I know not which were moſt aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
they in ſeeing him ſo near as they could not hide my body, or he in ſeeing as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
ſo many murderers. For he verily believed that they had killed me; and the
rather, becauſe coming nearer, he ſaw the blood freſh; for blood ran ſtill out of my
wounds, as freſh as if the wounds were newly given. When he was come up unto them,
and ſaw theſe wounds thus freſh, and them bloody, he began to reprehend them very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely,
and menace them with the puniſhments of God and men. Doe you think, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wretches as you are, ſaid he unto them, that though you ſhould hide this body in the
very center of the earth, <hi>Tautates</hi> would not diſcover it to the ſight of all? Can you
think this blood does not cry to heaven for vengeance? and that you can fly into any
any part of the earth where juſtice will not find you? How durſt you for a little mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
gaine which will deceive you, commit ſuch an execrable wickedneſſe? Theſe
Fiſhermen, who were not of any wicked temper, as afterwards they ſhewed, did bear a very
great reſpect unto this Druid; fell down upon their knees before him, proteſted themſelves
innocent of the blood, told him how they drew the body out of the water, what their
deſign was, that they had no arms to make theſe wounds, and that if they had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they could eaſily have fled when they ſaw him coming, and paſſed unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of the River, but they ſtayed ſtill, and would ſtand upon their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                     <p>The Good man conſidering all theſe circumſtances, he began to think they ſpoke truth;
but the better to know it, he came unto my Corps, and ſeeing the wounds ſo freſh; Doe
you tell me, ſaid he, that you are innocent of his death? We do ſweare it, ſaid they, by
the ſacred Misſleto: Then, ſaid the Druid, you may doe well to looke out for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
for doubtleſſe he cannot be far from hence; and beleeve it, if you do not find him
out, you your ſelves will be accuſed for it: And becauſe I would not have the innocent
puniſhed, and the guilty go free, where are his clothes which he had when you firſt found
him? The Fiſhermen, as if they had been already in the hand of the Judge, and never
thinking upon their reſolution, they did not onely produce what the Druid demanded of
them, but alſo the money and Rings, and all that they found. Then the good Druid,
ſaid unto them; Now friends, I doe thinke, you really innocent, ſince you doe ſo freely
produce theſe pretious things; be certain that God will aſſiſt you both in this occaſion
and all others. Then preſently falling downe upon his knees, and making a ſigne unto
them to doe the like.</p>
                     <p>Oh great Tautates, <hi>cryed he out, and lifting up his hands and eyes to Heaven;</hi> Thou
who haſt a particular care of men, we beſeech thee to turne thy vengeance from us for
the death of this Man, and let thy infinite goodneſſe forgive and amend them that did
commit this ſinne.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe my wounds ſtill bled, he commanded them to waſh me, and then do that
charitable office which they had begun in burying me: According to his command, they
did waſh me, then he asked of them a peece of money, which he intended according to
the Cuſtome when any was buryed, to put into my mouth: The poore Fiſhermen did all
as he commanded them; and the good old Druid, weak though he was, did take me in
his arms, and thought that he found ſome heat in me, which made him lay his hand
preſently upon my heart, which he perceived to move and tremble. Courage, my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
ſaid he, I hope this man has life enough to cleere you from the Calumny which
may be laid upon you, and to lay the fault where it rightly deſerves, for he is yet warm,
and I perceive his heart to beat: Then letting my head hang a little downe, the water
came out in great abundance, and the good Druid bound up my wounds with Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
as well as he could; then he commanded them to make a deviſe with their Oares,
whereon they might carry me with more eaſe; and whilſt they were working about it,
the good Druid went to ſeeke out ſome hearbs by the bank ſides, which he knew were
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53527:60"/>
good to be applyed unto my wounds, and which would a little freſhen and invigorate
my ſpirits; he was not long about them, but bruiſing thoſe Simples betwixt two ſtones,
he put ſome of them into my wounds, and applyed ſome to my heart, and preſently the
blood ſtayed: Preſently after, I began to breathe, and my pulſe came unto me, whereof
they were all ſo glad, that after thanks unto the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> they carried me upon
their Oars into the Cell of this good Druid, and laid me upon a good bed, where one
of his Nephews uſed ſometimes to lye, when he came to viſit him; for as for himſelfe,
his bed was onely a few dry leaves without any order or delicacy.</p>
                     <p>I was all the reſt of the day and never opened an eye, or gave any ſigne of life, but
onely my breath and my pulſe: The next morning about breake of day my eyes ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and I was never in my life more aſtoniſhed, than to ſee my ſelfe in that place; for I
remembred the Combate which I had, and my reſolution of throwing my ſelfe into the
River; but I could not poſſibly imagine how I ſhould come there. I continued long in
this thought; at laſt, the room growing lighter, and the little loophole which was in
lieu of a Window being towards the ſun riſing, I looked about, and the ſight made me
wonder more, for my Chamber was onely a Cave, the roof Rock, and Ivie my hangings:
Seeing all theſe things as I lay on my bed, I endeavoured to raiſe my ſelf a little, the
better to conſider them; but I was not able, both in reſpect of my weakneſſe, and alſo
by reaſon of my wounds. Bening then forced to lie ſtill as I was, and as they had laid me,
I began to put my hand to the places where I found my paine, and finding the Napkins
and ſuch other things as they had applyed unto me, I was ſtill more amazed. Then, not
being able to imagine how all theſe things ſhould come to paſſe, I began to think upon
ſuch ſtories as I had heard of concerning Water-Nymphs, and Goddeſſes, who dwelt in
Rivers, almoſt condemning my ſelfe of incredulity that I had not believed them, and
now thought that this place could not poſſibly be any other, then one of their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
But as a wandring mind does uſually rove immediately from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I preſently began to think upon the injuries and ingratitude of <hi>Madonthe.</hi> The
memory of which went ſo near my heart, as it forced from me ſo deep a ſigh, as the
good man of God heard me; for he was ſet at the door, attending till it was time to
come and ſee me. As ſoon as ever he heard me, he came into the Chamber, and without
ſaying any thing, after he had a little looked upon me, he went and opened the window
wider, that he might the better ſee in what condition I was: Afterwards coming to
me, feeling my pulſe and my heart, and finding me much amended, did ſeem to be
very glad of it: Then ſitting down in a Chaire which ſtood by my beds ſide, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a while upon me, he began thus to ſpeak. My Son, ſince the great God hath made
his love unto you evidently appeare by ſending you ſuch unexpected Aſſiſtance, you are
the more obliged unto th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nkes for ſo great a mercy and favour, and to be obedient unto
whatſoever he command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>: For as the acknowledgement of favours received from him,
does invite his hand unto more liberality, ſo ingratitude provokes him to ſlack his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and in lieu thereof, to chaſtiſe. Take good heed of this my Son, and let us ſee how
you will expreſſe your thankes by your words, and with what demonſtrations you
will acknowledge the particular Cure which hath been over you: upon this he was ſilent
to ſee what I would anſwer. This good old man, had a very venerable and grave aſpect,
a pleaſing look, a ſweet Phyſiognomy, and ſo mild a voyce, as it ſeemed as if ſome God
had ſpoken by his mouth: But yet my amazement was ſo great, as it was long before I
returned him an anſwer; He fearing that it was my weakneſſe, or the pain of my wounds,
which hindred me. Son, ſaid he, if your paine and weakneſſe will not permit you to
anſwer; yet make a ſign in teſtimony of your deſire, and God will ſo well accept it, as he
will give you further ſtrength. Then recollecting my ſpirits, I forced my ſelfe to anſwer
him with a feeble voyce, in theſe words: Father, it is not the wounds of my body hath
brought me into this condition wherein you ſee me; but it is the wounds of my ſoul,
which expecting no other cure or remedies, but ſuch as death uſeth to give unto thoſe
that are miſerable, made me look for an end of my life from a River, which it ſeems is
ſo pittileſſe, as ſhe will not not afford me that help which ſhe never denyes unto others.
Theſe things are ſtill in my memory, but I cannot tell how I came out of that River
wherein I threw my ſelfe; nor how I came into this place, and in your preſence.</p>
                     <p>Son, replyed the Druid, I perceive your crime, and the favour of <hi>Tautates</hi> are greater
then I did imagine them: For I had an opinion, that ſome of your enemies had thus uſed

longer, if he had not been prevented by the Fiſhermen who came into the Chamber, and
brought with them a man tyed with cords, ſo as at the firſt I did not know him, as well
becauſe my mind was diſtracted another way as becauſe he looked with a ſtrange affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                     <p>As ſoone as ever he ſaw me, he would have falne upon his knees, but he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                        </gap> my
Maſter, my Maſter, I knew him to be <hi>Halladine</hi> my Servant: You may imagine Madam
whether I was amazed to ſee him in that condition; for I could remember how I pulled
him into the water, and thought he had been drowned but I was much more amazed when
I heard one of the Fiſhermen addreſſe unto the Druid, &amp; aſſure him, that this was the man
who had brought me into the condition I was, and that he was not content with what
he had done, but he was looking about for the corps that he might hide it and his wicked
act together. The good old man would have ſpoke, when I interrupted and told him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
No, no, my friends, you are miſtaken, he is innocent, he is my Servant, and the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Servant I ever had, ſet him at liberty I intreat you, and let me imbrace him once more.
The poore men wondered to ſee me hug him ſo affectionately, and he falling downe upon
his knees at my bed ſide, with eyes ſhowring tears, he was ſo tranſported with joy, that
he could not ſpeake: But when he was unbound, I embraced him as tenderly as if he
had been my borther.</p>
                     <p>I was extreamly deſirous to know whether he had delivered my meſſage as I comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, and how he came to be brought thus unto me, but I durſt not aske him,
leaſt I ſhould diſcover what I deſired to keepe ſecret. The Druid who was diſcreet and
wiſe did perceive as much; For preſently upon it, ſeeming as if he would go and enquire
the manner of their meeting with this Servant, he went out of the Cell, and carryed with
him all but us two. My curioſity would not ſuffer me to be any longer without asking
him whether he had ſeene <hi>Madonthe,</hi> what ſhe and <hi>Lerian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> had ſaid and done, and
how he fell into the hands of theſe men? He anſwered me a farre off that he had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
my commands, and failed in nothing, that all thoſe who heard of my death, did
extreamly lament me, that had he thought to have found me alive, he would have brought
me an anſwer unto my letter; but being deſirous to doe me the laſt ſervice he could; he
came to looke for my corps along the River ſide, that he might give it buriall, intending
afterwards to retire himſelfe from that Country and all habitable places: And this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
going along the River ſide, he met theſe Fiſhermen, of whom he enquired for what
he ſought: And they, after they had looked upon him, and whiſpered a while together,
they fell upon him and bound him, as I ſaw he was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thinking it was he who had treated
me in that manner; that doe all they could; he would not tell my name, nor give them
any light by which they might know whom I was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Sir, ſaid he, I beſeech you by
what good fortune came you hither, and what good God was it that reſtored you unto
life againe? Then joyning his hands together, and lifted up his teare ſwelled eyes to
Heaven; for ever happy may he be, ſaid he, that did this good worke. <hi>Halladine,</hi> my
Friend, ſaid I unto him, I thanke thee heartily for thy good will, and I am very glad
thou haſt not revealed my name, for I would not have any know me to be alive: And
as to thy queſtion, how I came hither, you muſt enquire of ſome body elſe than me, for
I am as ignorant as thou art. And yet let me tell thee, that though Heaven has preſerved
my life againſt my will, I cannot chuſe but thank it, ſince I can by thee heare of <hi>Madon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,
Madonthe</hi> whom I beſeech the Heavens to preſerve, and unto whom I wiſh all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
and contentment. Oh Heavens (ſaid <hi>Halladine</hi>) is it poſſible you ſhould continue
ſtill in this errour? you have little reaſon to make that prayer for her, or ever to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
her, unleſſe to deteſt her and to be revenged both of her, <hi>Leriana,</hi> and <hi>Therſander:</hi>
And were I as you, I would doe it, and be as eager to diſpleaſe her as you have been to do
her ſervice. Were't thou, as I, replyed I thou wouldſt not give harbour unto any thought
ſo ill; and be aſſured that were I not confident thy language proceeds from thy love unto
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53527:61"/>
me, I would never looke upon thee againe with a good eye, ſo extreamely contrary are
thy thoughts unto mine; and therefore if thou wilt continue, with me unto the end of
my dayes (which will beere long: if it be as I deſire) never offer any ſuch language unto
me againe, nor againſt a perſon whom I love, as ſhe deſerves above all the world.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, I was ſo weake that I could ſay no more; for whether it was my ſudden
ſurprize of joy to ſee <hi>Halladine,</hi> or my anger to hear him utter ſuch language, I cannot
tell, but my wounds began to bleed ſo freſh, as I grew cold and pale, and almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pulſe. I perceived it, at the beginning of my talke, but becauſe I did not much deſire
to live, I would not ſpeake of it, and but for <hi>Halladine</hi> who tooke notice of my chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
colour, doubtleſſe I had then put an end unto all my miſeries; but that faithfull
Servant ran preſently to the Druid, and told him: He who during all the time of our
talke, was preparing what he thought beſt for the dreſſing of my wounds, and ſtayed
but for the terme of fifteene houres, before he would apply the firſt plaiſter, he came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
into the Chamber, and finding me all in blood, did conceive that ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
emotion was the cauſe of it; yet not ſeeming to take any notice of it then, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had carefully dreſſed me, and made me take ſome broth, he ſhut the window, and
bad me reſt a little; for this ſecond loſſe of blood had brought me ſo low, as I was not
able to lift up my hand.</p>
                     <p>In the meane while he took <hi>Halladine</hi> aſide, did put into his hands all that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Fiſhermen, and enquired very particularly who I was, and by what acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
I came to be in that condition, and thereupon related unto him all circumſtances,
how I was ſaved. My Servant gave him very many thanks for the aſſiſtance he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto me, and aſſured him, that he would not be ſorry for the paines he had taken; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
him by the great <hi>Tautates</hi> to continue it, and that both God and men would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him for ſo good a worke; as for the other queſtion which he asked him, they were
things he durſt not anſwer without my permiſſion, becauſe I had expreſly forbidden him;
but he might aſſure himſelfe, I was ſuch a one, as when he knew me, he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of his paine and time imployed in my ſervice; all he could ſay, was, that I was one
of the principall men in all <hi>Aquitane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Is he then a <hi>Gaul,</hi> replyed the Druid, and not a
Viſigot? Moſt true, replyed <hi>Halladine,</hi> but he was brought up by the King of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
in his houſe: It is enough, ſaid the good Druid, all I deſire to know more, is onely
what beliefe he has in the great Gods, for I tooke notice that he is extreamly troubled in
his mind, and moſt aſſuredly, the mind muſt then be cured before the body can. Indeed,
Father, anſwered <hi>Halladine,</hi> you have rightly obſerved his diſtemper, for never was mind
more poſſeſſed with a deepe melancholy, than the mind of this Cavalier: And for my
part I beleeve there are onely two remedies to cure him. What doe you thinke them to
be, asked the Druid? The one, ſaid <hi>Halladine,</hi> is God who is able to doe any thing:
Then replyed the good old man, we muſt have recourſe unto God, and pray unto him
to direct us in his cure; but what is the other? Death, ſaid <hi>Halladine:</hi> Still I ſee no
way, ſaid the holy man, but to have recourſe unto God. And ſince this time, he had ſo
great a care of me, as he would never be from me, at leaſt as little as poſſibly he could:
And one day when he perceived me to be a little better, he uſed ſo many arguments unto
me, and alledged ſo many reaſons as in concluſion I did acknowledge that nothing did
come to paſſe but by the appointment of God, who loving us better than we can do our
ſelves, it is to be in common reaſon ſuppoſed, that whatſoever he does is to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
though the Phyſicke he gives us be ſometimes bitter, and hard to be ſwallowed.
As ſoon as I was grounded in this knowledge, I preſently rejected my barbarous reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of dying, and reſigned my ſelfe ſo into the hands of great <hi>Tautates,</hi> as I began to
think all things ſweet ſince they came unto me from the Soveraign goodneſſe. This reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did operate ſo well, that in a little time, I was paſt danger, and within a few dayes
after that, ſo recovered, as I wanted only a little more ſtrength; which indeed by reaſon
of my loſſe of ſo much blood, was ſo great a want, as I muſt refer it unto time for my
recovery.</p>
                     <p>During which time, having nothing to buſie my ſelfe in, but my owne thoughts, I
was moſt commonly out of the little Cell, under the excuſe of taking the freſh Air, though
it was only becauſe none ſhould interrupt me. The good old man ſpent moſt of his time
in prayers and contemplation; and <hi>Halladine</hi> went out unto the neighbouring Townes
and Villages to provide Victuals, and other neceſſaries, whilſt I in the meane time, was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53527:62"/>
upon the top of the Rock, looking alwaies towards the place where I left <hi>Madonthe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as it was day, I was alwayes wont to leave my little Cell, and crawl a weak
march to the top of this Rock; where ſitting upon a moſſy Cuſhion, I ſummoned into
my memory all paſſages unto that very time, not forgetting neither my good fortune, nor
my bad, which went deep to my heart; for the miſery paſt did wound me, as much as
the miſery preſent; and I reſented the happineſſe which once I had, and then had not, as
a loſſe which was preſently raviſhed moſt injuriouſly from me</p>
                     <p>After dinner, retiring my ſelfe under ſome Trees which made a pleaſant ſhade not far
from the Cell; there I contemplated the miſerable condition unto which fortune had
reduced me: my own miſeries, and the happineſſe of another did equally offend me: the
one, by my own reſentment; the other, by envy and jealouſie of that contentment which
was raviſhed from me. But after Supper, walking along the River ſide, my contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was buſied in conſideration of thoſe miſeries which might fall upon me for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and what little hopes there was of preventing them, ſo as all my dayes journey
was divided into three kind of conſiderations; the morning, in things paſt; the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
in things preſent; and the evening in things future: and the laſt of theſe would laſt
ſo long, as they would take moſt of the night; being invited thereunto by the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the place, or by the ſilence of the night, or by the pleaſure I took in thinking
upon my diſpleaſures. For, Madam, life was a thing of ſo little value to me at that
time, as there was nothing I deſired more then to ſee the end of it: And being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to uſe no violence againſt my ſelfe, I wiſhed that ſome accident or other would be
ſo friendly to me, as to doe that good office for me, without my contributing unto the
homicide of my ſelfe: And I had an opinion, that if ſorrow increaſed on, as it had done
of late, it would doe the worke for me; ſo as I ſuffered this opinion to ſway ſo much in
my mind, as I could ſeldome begotten unto my lodging, unleſſe the good old man or my
ſervant, came to fetch me.</p>
                     <p>This kind of life, was ſo agreeable to my humour, as I was oft in a mind to quit both
Arms and Fortune, and ſtay here all the reſt of my dayes. And in order to this deſigne,
I acquainted my ſervant, adviſing him to retire himſelfe with thoſe goods which fortune
had given me, which I would freely beſtow upon him, if he would leave me in this place
where I would deſpiſe fortune, and bid her defiance. But <hi>Halladine</hi> in a flood of teares,
could ſay nothing elſe, but that nothing under heaven ſhould ſeparate him from me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
onely death; and that he wiſhed for no greater wealth then to ſerve me. Then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after he had gotten me to bed, and hearing me ſigh he came unto me; and ſince he
perceived I could not ſleep, he ſaid thus unto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is it poſſible, Sir, you ſhould har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
ſuch ſtrange thoughts of ruining your ſelfe? Ah my friend, ſaid I unto him, I ſhall
not be ſo ruined here, but griefe and ſorrows will find me out. And ſo they may very
well, ſir, (ſaid he unto me) as long as you doe thus forget your ſelfe, and what you were
wont to be, in ſo much as you will not endeavour your happineſſe, and try if you can
reſtore your ſelfe unto that ſtate which you have loſt. <hi>Halladine,</hi> (ſaid I and ſighed) It
is the height of imprudence, to attempt things impoſſible. Why, ſir, ſaid he, ſhould you
give the name of impoſſible unto that which you have not tryed, nor has any reaſon to
be ſo perſwaded? For my part, I have ſuch an opinion of my ſelfe, that any thing which
a ſervant can doe is not impoſſible; and I am much more certaine, that whatſoever any
Cavalier in Europe can obtaine, you can if you will. If this <hi>Therſander</hi> who is the
cauſe of your miſery, had this conſideration, he would attempt to remove you from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donthe.</hi>
And why ſhould not you doe as much for him? you were once in her favour,
and he removed you; and believe it, ſir, ſo may you him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that which has once been
done, may be done againe. Doſt thou not know, (ſaid I unto him) that <hi>Madonthe</hi> loves
him? Yes, ſaid he, And did ſhe not once love you? But now, anſwered I ſhe wiſhes me ill.
Have I not ſeen, ſir, anſwered he, her ſcorn him, and ſcorn is much further from love then
hatred? Hatred, replyed I, is further from friendſhip then ſcorn: 'Tis true, replyed he,
but there is much difference between love and friendſhip; for Love is more proud, and
never looks upon things that are deſpiſeable, but alwaies upon the rareſt, higheſt, and
moſt eſtimable things. And this is it which makes me thinke, that <hi>Madonthe</hi> after ſhe
had ſcorned <hi>Therſander</hi> ſo much as ſhe did, and afterwards did love him; ſo ſhe may
as well you, againſt whom ſhe had onely hatred, but never the leaſt ſhadow of ſcorn.
Friend, replied I, It is the love thou beareſt unto me, moves thee to talke thus in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53527:62"/>
my advantage. I talk, Sir, replied he, as any that is without paſſion may: Well, ſaid I
unto him, what is it thou wouldſt have me do? My affection, ſir, ſaid he, is it which
moves my tongue; and I beſeech you ſir, receive my language as proceeding from thence:
And ſince you command me, let me tell you, I would have you aſſume the ſame kinde
of life you were wont to live, and try if any happy encounter will help you to recover
that happineſs which is raviſhed from you: For I cannot ſee how it ſhould any way advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
you to ſtay here: I have ever had an opinion, that <hi>Madonthe</hi> does not hate you; or
if ſhe doe hate you, yet that ſhe does not love <hi>Therſander</hi> ſo well as you imagine: or if
ſhe doe love him, yet as ſhe has changed once, ſo ſhe may change againe: For I have
heard ſay, that the whole world is nothing but change; but ſay ſhe ſhould change,
and yet believe you dead, this change would not availe you at all; whereas if ſhe doe
but ſee you, it is impoſſible but ſhe ſhould revive her firſt ſparks of good will unto you.
Put out a Candle, Sir, and bring it to another that is light, you ſhall ſee how ſuddainly
it will light againe: The heart of one who once loved, is of the ſame nature, when it
comes in the preſence of the perſon loved; whereas abſence puts all hopes out, and is the
very ruine and death of love.</p>
                     <p>Well, well, <hi>Halladine,</hi> ſaid I unto him, we will thinke upon it, and ſee what the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
will adviſe us unto; then turning me about, I ſeemed as if I had an inclination to
ſleep; and yet it was onely becauſe I would not heare any more diſſwaſions from my ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
humour: but the Candle being put out, and I not being able to ſleep ſo ſoone, I
began to conſult and conſider upon the reaſons and arguments which <hi>Halladine</hi> urged;
and finding them upon ſerious conſideration to be very ſolid and good; I was almoſt in a
mind to leave this place, being eſpecially invited unto it out of a puiſſant deſire of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For I hoped, that being in queſt after adventures, I might perhaps meet with one
that would bring me to my death. Beſides this, I conſidered that it was impoſſible for
me to ſtay long there and not be known, ſince certainly thoſe Fiſhermen would be blab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
out all they knew of me: And being not far from the place where <hi>Thoriſmond</hi>
kept his Court, I could very hardly conceal my ſelf any longer.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conſiderations, and ſome others which I will omit, leſt I ſhould be too tedious
in my diſcourſe, did move me to take the advice which <hi>Halladine</hi> gave: And as ſoon as
it was day I walked, then told him that I would take his counſell; and that he ſhould
look out to buy Horſes for himſelfe and me, alſo to provide me Arms and other things
requiſite. Away he went immediately, the gladdeſt man in the world to ſee me in this
mind: and though he made all the haſte that poſſibly he could, yet he ſtayed ſome
twelve or fifteen dayes before he could get my Arms fitted unto my directions. During
his abſence, I grew more ſolitary and private then before, in ſo much as the good old
man did wonder at me. I muſt confeſſe, that at this time, I often diſputed with my
ſelfe, whether I ſhould break Priſon, and ſhake off my ſhakles or no, and uſing ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
as might be urged by Generoſity unto a man of courage, I was a while ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in my reſolutions. But this all-commanding Love, whom none is able to reſiſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
by flying, did out of ſpite, load me with new Fetters, and renewed my chains by new
meanes, ſo as I plainly ſaw there was now no hopes of ever having liberty.</p>
                     <p>The Fiſhers, Madam, with whom I often talked when they came to ſee me, as well to
know how I did, as in gratitude for the money which I had given them for their paines:
and becauſe they carried their Fiſh once a week unto the Town where <hi>Thoriſmond</hi> dwelt,
to ſell them there, they would oftentimes bring me the news of the Town. There was
one amongſt them, who was elder then the reſt, and ſhewed to have more wit, of whom
I uſed to enquire; and asking him what was the talk of the Town, he anſwered, that all
the talk was of a great Lady, who was brough to bed of a Childe; and becauſe the
Lawes of the <hi>Viſigots</hi> was to puniſh ſuch by fire, ſhe was condemned unto it. Obſerve,
Madam, how the heart will ſometimes ſoretell ſuch things as it feares: and though I did
never in my life, ſee any action in <hi>Madonthe</hi> which could in reaſon move me to ſuſpect her
guilty of ſuch a fault; yet I did preſently think it was ſhe? And for more aſſurance, I
asked him the name of this Lady, but he told me that he had forgotten it; yet he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
me ſhe was one of the principal Ladies who was unmarried.</p>
                     <p>Then did I take my ſuſpitions for certainties, when I reflected upon the kindneſſe which
was betwixt her and <hi>Therſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>der;</hi> and becauſe I would have no notice taken of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
I was conſtrained to leave their company, and retired my ſelfe under ſome Trees
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53527:63"/>
that were neere the houſe; and there being alone, oh what contrariety of thoughts came
into my mind to torment me? My vexation or rather my rage that I had been ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guld, moved me to a deſire to revenge for this injury: But how ſuddenly did I check
my thoughts when I conſidered my affection unto her: I muſt confeſſe, that ſtifling all
thoughts of revenge, I could not reſtraine my teares, which flowed moſt abundantly
when I thought upon the miſerable condition unto which Fortune had brought me: I
had continued longer in this Labyrinth of confuſed thoughts, if <hi>Halladine</hi> who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
had not come to fetch me away. At firſt when I ſaw him, I did imagine that he
had ſomething to tell me, but durſt not, yet ſince the old Fiſherman had broke the ice,
I was ſo bold as to aske him. Come <hi>Halladine,</hi> ſaid I unto him, haſt thou provided
Armes and Horſes? Yes Sir, ſaid he, all are ready, and I thinke you will be well fitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I have brought the Horſes hither, but I have left the Armes at the Townes end, where I
have cauſed them to be locked up: Thou haſt ſtayed ſo long, replyed I, as I was almoſt
out of all patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But good <hi>Halladine,</hi> I charge thee upon thy Fidelity, to tell
me truly, haſt thou heard any newes of <hi>Madonthe?</hi> Shall I tell you Sir, ſaid he what
I know? With all my heart, replyed I, for I doe extreamly deſire it; I feare, replyed he
that I ſhall but vex and grieve you Sir, if I ſhould. Oh Heavens, <hi>Halladine</hi> (cryed I
out) thou haſt told me enough, my ſuſpitions are all truths; Is ſhe condemned to the fire
for having a Child? tell me truly. Whoſoever told you ſo, replyed he, told you the
truth; but Sir, how came you to know it? The Fiſhermen, replyed I, who uſe to goe
and ſell their fiſh, are my informers: But <hi>Halladine</hi> I conjure thee to tell me all thou
knoweſt, and conceal not any thing, as thou loveſt me. Sir, ſaid he, ſince you are pleaſed
to command me with ſo many aſſeverations, I will; though I know that this new Newes
will vex you as much, as it ought to doe the contrary. Then he related unto me, how ſince
the workmen required ſo much time, before they could finiſh my Armes, he thought
that he could not ſpend his time better, than in going to Court, being confident that I
would be glad of newes at his returne; that being there as privately as poſſibly he could,
he was put unto no great matter of paines for newes, becauſe <hi>Madonthe</hi> was the Towne
talke all over; that <hi>Leriana</hi> was her Accuſer, and that <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his brother would
maintaine what <hi>Leriana</hi> ſaid, concerning her and <hi>Therſander.</hi> How, replyed I preſently,
is it poſſible that <hi>Madonthe</hi> ſhould looke ſo low, as upon a man ſo baſe? <hi>Halladine,</hi>
who thought that this conſideration might make me ſcorne her. Yes Sir, ſaid he, it is ſo
held for certaine, and conſidering what proofes <hi>Leriana</hi> makes, none beleeves the
contrary.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſſe Madam, that hearing this newes confirmed, I was ſo aſtoniſht at it, as
but for <hi>Halladine,</hi> I had falne to the ground. At laſt, recollecting my ſelfe, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a pace or two, I folded my armes one with the other, and lifting up my eyes to
heaven, with a deep ſigh I ſaid: Oh God, how deep are thy judgements? and by how
many ſtrange wayes doſt thou diſcover truth? Then ſtanding a while ſilent, as raviſhed
with admiration, at laſt I broke out againe. Oh <hi>Madonthe,</hi> is it then true, that you
have made choice of <hi>Therſander,</hi> and preferred him before me, was your ſpirit ſo low,
as to make him Lord of your will, whom your Predeceſſors did highly honour in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him their Servant? Is is poſſible that generous heart which heretofore I have ſeene
in you ſhould be thus changed, As not to die rather than endure the ſhame of ſuch a
choice? Oh God, oh Heavens, why would you infuſe ſuch a baſe diſſembling ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſo faire a body?</p>
                     <p>After this, I ſtood a long while ſilent, as having ſo much to ſay, that I could not ſpeake
at all, reſembling a bottle that is full which will not come out but with ſome difficulty.
<hi>Halladine</hi> who conſidered my affection, thinking to comfort me, and ſeeing me ſo long
ſilent, he took occaſion to ſpeak unto me. Had I thought Sir, ſaid he, that this news would
have reliſhed ſo ill, you ſhould never have known it by me: Why <hi>Halladine,</hi> ſaid I unto him
couldeſt thou ever thinke I would not be ſenſible of her ſhame whom I loved above all the
world? And why ſhould you doe ſo Sir, replyed he, ſince ſhe proves a perſon who has
given you occaſion to hate her above all the World. Love, replyed I, is greater in me,
than any wrong can be in her, and doſt thou not know that the wound which is once
made will never heale? If maladies may be cured by Antipathy, and contrary medicines,
replyed <hi>Halladine,</hi> then that love which was cauſed by vertues and favours may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in you by the injuries which you have received from her, and by the knowledge of ſo
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53527:63"/>
foule a fault. That which cauſeth love, ſaid I unto him, is fate and deſtiny unto whom
the heavens have ſubmitted it, and therefore there is no thought that it will change, untill
the very heavens and deſtiny themſelves doe change: And as for matter of ſhame I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to be her Champion againſt all thoſe who ſhall oppoſe her fame with
any Calumny. Heavens forbid it Sir, ſaid he unto me, for you will have to deale with
two of the ſturdieſt Cavaliers in all <hi>Aquitane;</hi> beſides you will too apparently wrong
your ſelfe, and exceedingly offend a juſt God in maintaining a quarrell that is unjuſt.
As for the valour of <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his brother (ſaid unto him) it is not unknowne unto
me, and it ſhall not be that which ſhall divert me from the Combate: But as to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
which you mention to be againſt God, I doe referre it unto him, ſince it is his
pleaſure to make me love <hi>Madonthe</hi> ſo paſſionately, as it is a thing impoſſible for me to
doe otherwiſe. Good Sir, ſaid he, will you offer to imploy your courage in taking arms
for the defence of one who has moſt unworthily uſed you? are you not ſenſible of ſuch
injuries, and would you have all the World take notice of this inſenſibility? Doe you
not remember how inſupportably rigorous ſhe was to you, whilſt ſhe was in the arms of
<hi>Therſander,</hi> and loaded him with more favours than he could deſire? Will you againſt
all reaſon expoſe your life in defence of one who to content another, ſcorned you? Shall
it be ever ſaid that you did unjuſtly arme your ſelfe to preſerve the pleaſures and delights
of <hi>Therſander?</hi> He would have continued longer had not I interrupted him. Enough,
enough <hi>Halladine,</hi> ſaid I unto him, no more of this language to me; the ſtone is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
throwne, and it cannot be recalled; I am fully reſolved upon it, all that thou haſt ſaid
or can ſay, cannot unreſolve me</p>
                     <p>When I doe thinke upon <hi>Madonthes</hi> death, and that I ſhall never ſee her more whom
I doe love ſo well; when I conſider the paine and confuſion in which ſhe is, and the ſhame
which is prepared for her, and when I doe remember, it is ſhe whom <hi>Damon</hi> hath ſo long
ſerved, and that ſhe muſt now be throwne into the Fire. Oh God, oh Heavens, <hi>Halla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi>
doſt thou thinke I am able to indure it? and can any injury or ſcorne hinder me
from giving her all the aſſiſtance I can? No, no, <hi>Halladine, Damon</hi> muſt either ceaſe
to live, or elſe he muſt not ceaſe from doing what is his duty: It is the duty of a Cavalier to
relieve afflicted and diſtreſſed Ladies, whether this Lady be accuſed juſtly or unjuſtly God
knows; as for us we ought rather to think the beſt, than to ſuſpect the worſt: And ſince
<hi>Leriana</hi> is her accuſer, I muſt thinke <hi>Madonthe</hi> wronged, knowing the extreame malice
which ſhe beares unto her; I will therefore render <hi>Madonthe</hi> this proofe of my affection.
I know, <hi>Halladine,</hi> thou wilt ſay that ſhe will thanke me no more for this ſervice than
for others ſhe hath received from me but, friend, it is no matter if ſhe do not; I ſhall ſatisfie
my duty in it, and then I have the recompence I expect. My Servant ſeeing me ſo fully
ſetled upon it, he told me, that ſince I was ſo reſolved, he could doe no more but pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God for a bleſſing upon my intentions and endeavours; but if I would execute my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
I muſt not loſe a minute of time: For the laſt hour which the King had given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> would expire to morrow by noone, and that from the place where we
were, the neereſt way was five Leagues at the leaſt unto the Towne of <hi>Tectoſages,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
eight Leagues to paſſe by the place where my Arms lay; ſo as it was full time to
depart that very hour.</p>
                     <p>Upon this intelligence, I reſolved to take Horſe preſently; and leaſt the good old
Druid ſhould make me loſe any time, I thought it beſt to depart without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him untill afterwards, and then if I proved victorious, I would make my excuſe,
and thanke him for the great obligations wherein I was bound unto him. I tooke Horſe
then, and made all haſte I could to the place where my Armes lay, I tryed them, and
found them to be very good and fit, they were blacke, and on the Shield a Tyger fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon the heart of a man with this Motto.
<q>Thou giv'ſt me death, and I ſuſtaine thy life.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then, without more delay, I rode to the Town of <hi>Tectoſages,</hi> and made ſuch haſte,
as I came a little before noon: I alighted, to give my Horſe a little reſt, for indeed he
was weary; and this might well have been <hi>Madonthes</hi> ruine; for when I came to the liſts,
I found the Combate already begun, but one Cavalier againſt two: and certainly had I
ſtayed never ſo little longer that Cavalier had dyed, and <hi>Madonthe</hi> been convicted; for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53527:64"/>
he fell into a ſwoon when I was entred not ten paces into the liſts; and had he falne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I had entred, the Combate had been ended, and it would not have been permitted me
to begin it againe: But God was pleaſed I ſhould arrive ſo opportunely, as the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of that Lady was made known: For to omit the particulars of the Combate, it will
ſuffice to tell you, that it pleaſed God to give me victory over theſe two valiant Brothers,
who were overcome rather by the innocency of <hi>Madonthe,</hi> then any ſtrength or virtue in
me, unleſſe ſo, that being armed for the life and honour of my miſtreſſe, the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
could not reſiſt me.</p>
                     <p>Thus I was victorious; and when I leaſt though of it, the truth was manifeſted; <hi>Leri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
detected, <hi>Madonthe</hi> cleared; the Childe known to belong unto one that was Neece
unto <hi>Leriana:</hi> and to be briefe, all things ſo cleared, that the wicked <hi>Leriana</hi> was caſt
into the ſame fire which ſhe had prepared for <hi>Madonthe; Madonthe</hi> ſet at liberty, and
I the gladdeſt man that ever was, to ſee ſhe had beene wrongfully accuſed: and that
though ſhe had injured me, yet it was without the leaſt ſtaine unto her honour or chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
This was ſuch a high contentment unto me, as I eſteemed all the paines I had
taken in her ſervice, more then recompenced.</p>
                     <p>Seeing this thus ſettled, and thinking it not expedient to make my ſelfe known, untill
I knew a little better whether or no ſhe loved <hi>Therſander;</hi> or whether all that I had ſeen
concerning it, was onely the artifice and ſubtilty of <hi>Leriana,</hi> I went unto her ſcaffold,
to know whether I could ſerve her in any other occaſion: She gave me many thanks, and
had two requeſts unto me; the one was, to tell her who I was; &amp; the other, to conduct her
unto her houſe: As for telling her my Name, I excuſed it as well as I could; and as for
conducting her, I ſaid I would, upon condition it might be preſently: And becauſe at
the ſame time, a throng of Ladies came to congratulate her delivery, and alſo becauſe I
feared the King would cauſe me to declare my ſelfe, alſo becauſe I had ſome wounds
which required dreſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I went into the croud and ſo ſtole away; ſo as every one being
diverted another way, none took any notice which way I went: And ſo I came to the
place where I left my ſervant, where binding up my wounds as well as I could, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my Horſe graze a little, I got up againe, and went to my good old Druid.</p>
                     <p>I forgot to tell you, Madam, That meeting a man going to the Town, I entreated him
to make my excuſe unto <hi>Madonthe;</hi> and, leſt ſhe ſhould think me uncivil, I feigned to
be engaged another way by promiſe, but if ſhe had any further ſervice to imploy me in,
ſhe might hear of me towards <hi>Mount d'Or,</hi> and that I would ſtill weare my enſigne of a
Tiger. My deſigne was, to make her believe I was gone that way, though I did not intend
it, leaſt the Kings curioſity ſhould be ſuch as to find out who I was.</p>
                     <p>I cannot, Madam, expreſſe unto you, with what joy the good Druid received me, nor
his thankes, when he knew the cauſe of my voyage, and the ſucceſſe and ſervice I had
done <hi>Madonthe</hi> in her great neceſſity: For he told me, that her Father brought him up;
and that in this action I had over paid him, for all the paines and care he had taken about
me. And becauſe he ſaw my arms bloody, he took them off, and looked about every part
of me; then finding ſome wounds, he was ſo careful of me, and took ſuch courſes, as I
was well again in a little time.</p>
                     <p>But ſince the beſt Phyſick, and no other could cure me, but to hear more of <hi>Madonthe,</hi>
I intreated the good old Druid to ſend one of the Fiſhers unto the place where <hi>Thoriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
was, to inquire what newes. The good man did as I deſired, and the Fiſher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
ſo well, as at his return he brought me but too much newes for my contentment:
That <hi>Madonthe</hi> was gone to her houſe, and carried <hi>Therſander</hi> with her wounded as he
was; for it was he who before I came, was in Combate with <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother. I
underſtood farther, that a little after the departure of <hi>Madonthe,</hi> how King <hi>Thoriſmond</hi>
was killed by his Chyrurgion, who in letting him blood had cut the vein, and that his
brother <hi>Eurick</hi> ſucceeded him. I cannot expreſſe, Madam, how near theſe two accidents
went unto my heart; onely thus far, I never think upon them, but the memory is ſo ſad,
as I conclude no reſt belongs unto me but in my Grave.</p>
                     <p>Thus every thing from whence I expected comfort, augments my miſery; all my hopes
are now quite blaſted, ſolitary places diſpleaſed, becauſe there I thought upon nothing
but the Towne of <hi>Tectoſages,</hi> and my thoughts grated upon my very ſoul, when
they repreſented unto me the ingratitude of this woman. To be brief, I was angry with my
ſelfe, becauſe I loved her againſt reaſon, and could not chuſe but love her. My condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53527:64"/>
grew worſe then ever; my wounds indeed being but ſmall, did heal in a few days;
but I became ſo pale as if I were dead, and this paleneſſe preſently after turned into ſuch
a yellowneſſe, as if I had rubbed my ſelfe with Saffron. <hi>Halladine,</hi> who had heard ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of <hi>Madonthes</hi> actions, did ſuſpect what the cauſe was of my being thus diſordered,
and watched for an opportunity of ſpeaking unto me But the good old man not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what to thinke, he adviſed me to change aire, hoping that exerciſe and diverſion
might recover my health; and I according to the advice of this good man, reſolved to
ſee the world, and wander from place to place, and reſt no where, till death arreſted
me.</p>
                     <p>After then, I had given moſt hearty thankes unto this good man, I departed, without
any other deſigne in my voyage, than continuall wandring: yet as fortune was, our way
did lie towards <hi>Madonthes</hi> houſe, where we heard ſuch newes, as did more and more ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
my miſery. For we heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this ill adviſed woman (as <hi>Halladine</hi> calls her)
was gone, or rather ſtolne away, without any in her company but her Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe and <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander.</hi>
Imagine what operation this report had upon me; my Servant would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
me, that ſhe did me no wrong in it, but onely herſelfe; for ſhe believing me to be
dead, as all <hi>Aquitane</hi> did, I had no reaſon to blame her: But however, my diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
was ſo great, as not being able to endure the ſight of ſuch places where formerly
I found ſuch delight, and now diſpleaſure; I reſolved to leave <hi>Europe,</hi> and never to
leave wandring till I met with ſomething that would ſhorten my ſad life. So I paſſed
into <hi>Africa,</hi> there I ſaw King <hi>Genſerick</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> his Son, and found every where
that Love works the ſame effects that it did in me: I meane, that it augments and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth,
changes and rechanges, delights and diſpleaſures, in all thoſe that are ſubjects
unto it, according to its own pleaſure without any reaſon. For being amongſt theſe <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi>
I heard of the fortunes of <hi>Urſaſes</hi> and <hi>Olimbres,</hi> and of young <hi>Placidia,</hi> and her
Mother <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> wife unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> all whom by their examples, could not divert
me from ſtill loving; but I learned rather this leſſon, That whoſoever will love, muſt
prepare themſelves for good and bad, and receive them both with the ſame viſage. And
conſidering the various changes in the fortune of <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> the long perſervance of <hi>Urſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
his love, the prudent behaviour of young <hi>Olimbres,</hi> and the happy concluſion of their
loves; I reſolved not to afflict my ſelfe ſo much at the croſſes which I had in my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but thence forward, to endure them with more patience. And becauſe <hi>Halladine</hi> who
was tired out with my long and tedious travels, did adviſe me not to love her any longer,
who did not think me ſo much as in the world, thinking that if he could bring me to
this conſideration, I ſhould eaſily be perſwaded to return into <hi>Aquitane:</hi> I told him, to
put him out of all hope, that I would love her ſtill.</p>
                     <p>In concluſion; finding no reſt any where, nor ſatisfaction in any diverſion, I ſaw that
all humane prudence was to no purpoſe, and therefore I would have recourſe unto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Counſells; ſo as hearing that at the further end of the <hi>Pirenian</hi> hills towards the
Sea, there was an Oracle which was called the Temple of <hi>Venus;</hi> I returned into <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
and enquired of the Oracle, of which I asked nine dayes together, what it was which
would either put to an end, or elſe cure my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> The Oracle anſwered, <hi>Forreſts:</hi> The
next morning I asked where <hi>Forreſts</hi> was? it anſwered againe, <hi>Forreſts;</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
my importunity, the Oracle was mute, and would give no other anſwer but
<hi>Forreſts;</hi> ſo as I reſolved to look for <hi>Forreſts</hi> all <hi>Europe</hi> over. I will not tell you, Madam,
how many ſeverall places I paſſed, and all in vaine, onely in generall; how after I had
run through all <hi>Spain, Cantabria, Gaul, Narbon,</hi> and <hi>Aquitane,</hi> I came into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the <hi>Gebennes,</hi> and reſolved to ſee <hi>Hircania</hi> and <hi>Ardennes,</hi> and all other places
through the world: For I cannot be perſwaded, that this God who is moſt true and juſt
unto all other men, ſhould be a deceiver unto me alone: but on the contrary, I hope
that in theſe ſolitary places I ſhall finde that contentment which is promiſed unto
me.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Damon</hi> concluded the Hiſtory of his miſerable life. And <hi>Galathea,</hi> who had
formerly heard the firſt part, was very glad ſhe had heard the reſt, and deſired to give him
all the contentment this Country afforded. Therefore when he had finiſhed, ſhe ſaid
thus unto him. I muſt needs confeſſe, ſir, you have reaſon to complaine againſt your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
having without any reaſon been ſo long afflicted, but ſtill you muſt not let your
hopes droop: for the Gods are no Impoſtors, nor deceivers; and having received ſuch an
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53527:65"/>
anſwer from them, you muſt beleeve that you ſhall find that contentment which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
Tis true they are pleaſed ſometimes to give ambiguous and obſcure anſwers, and
that to teach us, that there is no happineſſe to be obtained without a mixture of miſery,
and that they are pleaſed humane wits ſhould buſie themſelves in finding out the truth,
and true meaning of their Oracles; and if you will have my opinion upon this anſwer
you have received, I think you have not rightly underſtood it, in conceiving that this word
<hi>Forreſts,</hi> does ſignifie Woods and ſolitary places, peopled only with Trees; but you muſt
know that this Country wherein you now are, is not only called the Country of the <hi>Segu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaus,</hi>
but more particularly called <hi>Forreſts,</hi> ſo as I do beleeve, it is this <hi>Forreſts</hi> in which the
Oracle intends you ſhall find that happineſs which you are to receive. And to tell you truly
it is very probable that this is the Country and place, and not in Woods &amp; places ſolitary:
For it may ſo fall out that <hi>Madonthe</hi> may come hither upon ſome occaſion which may be
hid from you; therefore take heart, and beleeve, that as one evill never comes alone, ſo one
good is alwayes accompanied with another. It is a happineſſe you ſhould light upon the
place which the Oracle foretels ſhall put an end unto your miſeries, and ere long it will
be ſeconded with ſuch another as may afford you the effects of all.</p>
                     <p>Madam, anſwered <hi>Damon</hi> and ſighed, I find all you ſay to be grounded upon great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and I doe believe I ſhall ſhortly ſee the accompliſhment of the Oracle which promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
that in <hi>Forreſts</hi> I ſhall finde an end of my miſery: For I hope Death will doe that
which Love could not. No, no Sir, ſaid the Nymph, you muſt have better hopes than
ſo, and being to inquire with me to morrow of the Oracle in this place, I hope you will
receive better contentment; and in this opinion, I have taken order to provide all things
neceſſary for the Sacrifice, both for you and me. In the the meane time our Coaches and
your Servant may returne, but I have one requeſt, unto you, Sir, which is, that you
will not leave me untill you have brought me unto the houſe of <hi>Amaſis</hi> my Mother, who
I am ſure will bid you moſt heartily welcome. The Cavalier, anſwered her, That it
was his intention to conſult with the Oracle of this place, and that he tooke it for a
great honour ſhe would permit him to inquire with her; alſo he would wait upon her
unto <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and tender his ſervice unto her, that as for the hopes which ſhe gave him,
truly he did hope, but it was onely in death, which could not come ſo ſoone as he did
paſſionately deſire.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Galathea</hi> diſpatched a meſſenger unto <hi>Bonlieu</hi> to the venerable <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſante,</hi>
to acquaint her that ſhe would come unto her, and upon the meſſengers returne
underſtood that <hi>Aſtrea, Diana, Phillis,</hi> and all the ſhepherds dined there, and intended
to goe and viſit <hi>Alexis,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Adamas:</hi> This meſſenger was a young fellow
that had been brought up in her ſervice from his infancy, and therefore being very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
with her, he uſed to acquaint her with all the newes he met withall in any place
where he had been. At this time, after he had delivered the anſwer of the venerable <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſante,</hi>
he followed his cuſtome, and ſaid.</p>
                     <p>I aſſure you Madam, that except your ſelfe, I never ſaw any ſo faire as <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and

                        </gap>er beloved <hi>Celadon,</hi> and to heare what was
become of him, ſhe ſpoke alowd before <hi>Damon,</hi> and ſaid unto him: How <hi>Lerindas,</hi> (for
that was his name) doe you thinke thoſe ſhepherdeſſes ſo faire, that you prefer them before
all my Nymphs? It is not I who prefers them, ſaid he, but it is truth. But how canſt
thou make us believe, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> that ſuch Country wenches as they, are ſo very
faire? Madam, ſaid he, I vow, that were I a Cavalier, I would maintaine their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
againſt all the World; and did you ſee them, I am confident, that for all your valour
you would not enter into the Liſts againſt me upon ſo bad a quarrell. But tell me <hi>Lerindas</hi>
(ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> and ſmiled) which of them does pleaſe you moſt? Doubtleſſe, anſwered
he, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is the fairer, but ſhe is ſo ſad and melancholly, as therefore <hi>Diana</hi> pleaſeth
me beſt: For thoſe wenches that are ſo deepely in Love, never pleaſed me ſo well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Who is it, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> whom <hi>Aſtrea</hi> loves? I can onely tell you, Madam,
replyed he; that ſhe is ſad and melancholly, and they ſay ſhe is ſo becauſe a Shepherd was
drowned about four or five Months ſince. And <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid the Nymph, is ſhe in love
with any? They ſay No, anſwered he, &amp; yet there are two about her who torment her much
if ſhe doe not love them; the one is called <hi>Paris,</hi> and the other <hi>Silvander;</hi> the truth is, if
I were to chuſe, I ſhould give my voice for <hi>Silvander;</hi> for though he be but a ſhepherd,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53527:65"/>
yet I never ſaw one more Gentile, nor civiliſed. If thou goeſt on, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> thou
wilt make us all deſirous to become ſhepherdeſſes, onely to enjoy ſuch good company.
Madam, anſwered he, you may chance beleeve theſe to be but Fables, but I am confident
two or three dayes could not, be better imployed then amongſt them. Then <hi>Galathea</hi>
turning towards the aged <hi>Cleontine.</hi> Mother, ſaid ſhe, I am halfe in a mind to ſtay here
two or three dayes, that <hi>Damon</hi> may a little eaſe his wounds whilſt in the interim walk
towards <hi>Lignon,</hi> and ſee whether all theſe reports of the ſhepherdeſſes be true. Madam
anſwered <hi>Cleontine,</hi> their converſation is the ſweeteſt and pleaſanteſt you can imagine;
and beleeve it, there is nothing of Ruſtique in them but the name, ſo as if you deſire to
take that pleaſure, now is the moſt conveniency; for the great Druid is to come and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a ſolemne ſacrifice of thankes unto <hi>Tautates</hi> for the Misſleto, which is found neer their
Towne, What kind of ceremony is that? asked <hi>Galathea;</hi> for they uſe to gather this
Misſleto the ſixteenth of the Month of <hi>July.</hi> Tis true, anſwered <hi>Cleontine,</hi> but this is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a ſacrifice of Thanks, that <hi>Tautates</hi> would be pleaſed to honour that place with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any other, and making it to grow, as they ſay, upon the goodlieſt Oake that ever
was ſeen, and in thus favouring that Towne it is a ſigne he loves it above others. How do
you know (ſaid the Nymph) that the great Druid comes now to performe this Sacrifice?
becauſe, ſaid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> he promiſed it ſhould be within eight dayes, whereof four are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
paſt, ſo as if he keepe his word, he cannot deferre it no longer: And I am certaine,
his haſte would be the more, did he know it was your pleaſure to honour the ſolemnity
with your prefence.</p>
                     <p>This made <hi>Galathea</hi> reſolve to retard her journey unto <hi>Bon-lieu,</hi> as well to eaſe <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
as to ſee theſe ſhepherdeſſes; and becauſe ſhe had not yet ſent to acquaint <hi>Amaſis</hi>
with the accident which had hapned, and likewiſe becauſe ſhe might wonder at her ſtay
ſo long, ſhe diſpatched one of <hi>Cleontines</hi> Servants, to acquaint her with all that had
hapned, with the cauſe of her ſtay at <hi>Mount Verdan,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Damons</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ounds, and
the occaſion of his coming into this Country. Asſoone as <hi>Amaſis</hi> received this Newes,
ſhe was much pleaſed, and much diſpleaſed both: For ſhe was very glad to heare that
<hi>Damon</hi> was alive, whom ſhe thought dead, becauſe he was her Kinſman in a near de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and the carriage of <hi>Polemas</hi> did extreamly diſpleaſe her, it being againſt a perſon
of ſo much merit, and in the preſence of her daughter, whom it was his duty to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
And to ſhew how ill ſhe reſented it, ſhe tooke Coach immediately, and went as
faſt as ſhe could unto <hi>Mount Verdan,</hi> where her daughter was amazed at her ſudden co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and asked her the reaſon of her ſudden reſolution. She told her that ſhe came to
ſee <hi>Damon,</hi> and offer him whatſoever was in her power, as her Kinſman, and as one who
had much obliged her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Damon</hi> being advertiſed of her coming, he aroſe out of bed to meet her for his wounds
were ſuch as he might doe it without danger, but being ſurpriſed upon ſuch a ſudden he
accoaſted her onely with excuſes, and thankes for ſo great a favour. I am obliged, ſaid
ſhe, unto you more than this, as well by conſanguinity, as by memory of him who gave you
life, who at the returne with <hi>Thoriſmond</hi> King of the <hi>Viſigots,</hi> made unto <hi>Tectoſages,</hi>
after he had fought <hi>Attilas</hi> in the <hi>Catalaunique</hi> fields with ſo great an Army, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the ruine of this Country, turning his paſſage by the <hi>Sequanois,</hi> by the lower <hi>Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broges,</hi>
by the <hi>Veblomiens,</hi> and by the Mountaines of <hi>Gebbenes,</hi> and ſo into his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And this Obligation was not ſo little as it was thought of: For the young King I
know not how, did fall in love with one of my Nymphs, who having no mind to marry
he raviſhed her away by force, doubtleſſe upon my inſtigation of her unto that deniall.</p>
                     <p>Madam (anſwered the Cavalier) all men are obliged to ſerve Ladies, particularly thoſe
of your quality and merit: And my father in doing you this little ſervice, which you are
pleaſed to remember, did right unto the title of a Cavalier; and I ſucceeding him, doe
offer unto you my blood and life.</p>
                     <p>Much more diſcourſe of civility paſſed betwixt them, &amp; in concluſion ſhe told him, that
ſhe would have him carryed unto <hi>Marcelles</hi> in a Litter, that his wounds might be there
better looked unto: But he excuſed himſelf ſo, as ſhe permitted him to ſtay there for ſome
dayes till his wounds were better: and this he deſired, becauſe he would be more quiet,
and out of the world, ſince <hi>Madonthe</hi> was not in it for him, reſolving that as ſoon as
he had conſulted with the Oracle, and conducted <hi>Galathea</hi> to her Mother, he would get
himſelfe ſo farre as where he ſhould not be known, nor the name of <hi>Madonthe</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53527:66"/>
by any. <hi>Galathea</hi> was very glad of his not going to <hi>Marcelles,</hi> becauſe ſhe might
the more conveniently ſtay at <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>unt Verdun</hi> with him, under a pretence that ſhe might
ſpend ſome dayes amongſt the ſhepherdeſſes, where ſhe hoped to heare ſome newes of
<hi>Celadon,</hi> or at the leaſt to ſee the beauty of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> which had cauſed that ſhepheard to
diſdain hers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amaſis</hi> ſeeing he would not ſtir from the place where he was, and fearing to be too
troubleſome unto him if ſhe ſtayed any longer, becauſe the houſe was little; ſhe returned
unto <hi>Marcelles</hi> after many excuſes, for the diſcourteſie which <hi>Polemas</hi> had ſhewed unto
him, and which ſhe proteſted ſhould not paſſe unpuniſhed. <hi>Damon</hi> who was all ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and civility, and who had often paſſed the like hazards, he beſeeched her to think
no more upon it, becauſe it was a thing above his merit; and becauſe the offence of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas</hi>
was ſufficiently puniſhed by the loſſe of his kinſman. He did ſo extenuate the fault,
that though <hi>Galathea</hi> who was extreamly offended at <hi>Polemas</hi> for being ſo inſolent in
her preſence, did give the crime all due aggravations; yet <hi>Amaſis</hi> promiſed <hi>Damon</hi>
to doe whatſoever he deſired, intending to give him all the ſatisfaction and contentment
ſhe could: Yet at her return unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> ſhe did let <hi>Polemas</hi> ſee how much this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
diſpleaſed her, though he excuſed it as well as he could, ſaying it was not done by
his command: but whilſt he was buſie in helping <hi>Arganteus,</hi> his ſouldiers ſeeing him
in that caſe, would needs revenge his death. <hi>Amaſis</hi> who was very well informed how all
paſſed, commanded him to turn off his ſervice all ſuch unworthy perſons, as would offer
ſuch a baſe act; which <hi>Polemas</hi> did with ſo ill a will, and was ſo vexed againſt <hi>Damon,</hi> as he
reſolved to be revenged upon him. Beſides, he being of an envious nature, and ſeeing how
much the Nymph did eſteem him, he was not able to endure it. But that which came
neereſt the quick, was, that having ſome hopes of marrying <hi>Galathea,</hi> and finding that he
could not with all his tricks make her love him, he began to contrive the meanes how he
ſhould mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> himſelfe ſoveraign Lord of the State, and to compaſſe that by force which
Love denyed him: he was the more induced unto this enterpriſe, becauſe he ſaw much
facility in bringing it about; <hi>Clidemant</hi> being abſent; with <hi>Lindamore, Gugamant,</hi> and
all the Grandees of the Country: All the chief places of ſtrength in his hands, and all
the Souldiers liſted; and being backed by a great number of his kindred and allies, both
within and without the State: Alſo, on the contrary, <hi>Amaſis</hi> having nothing but ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
on her ſide, having conferred all the power upon that faith and confidence ſhe had in
him.</p>
                     <p>He thus aſpiring unto this enterpriſe, and being prompted thereunto by Love and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
he could not ſee any able to give him a ſtop; for <hi>Amaſis</hi> had not one Cavalier
which had not dependence upon him, and were under his Authority, except <hi>Damon,</hi> who
though ſingle, made him afraid of his valour: And fearing that <hi>Amaſis</hi> being diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by this laſt action, ſhould keep him in the Country, and confer Authority upon him
by the ſun-ſhine of her favours, he reſolved to prevent it. For he remembred that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
the Father of this Cavalier ſhould once have married <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and all the great
value and eſteem which ſhe now ſet upon him, he did attribute it unto the remembrance
ſhe had of that. This conſideration was a cauſe, why taking aſide ſix of the Souldiers
whom <hi>Amaſis</hi> had commanded him to diſcharge; he ſpoke thus unto them, after he
had made many a complaint againſt her.</p>
                     <p>Friends, ſaid ſhe, It is a thing impoſſible to change the nature of any thing, uſe what
art, or doe what one can: you know with what care and paines I have ſerved <hi>Amaſis,</hi>
and how I have not ſpared any thing which depended upon meor my friends, which might
contribute to her ſervice: And this, not once, but upon all occaſions that ſel out. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
I have not given my beſt friends all that ſatisfaction which I owe unto them. But it is
a thing abſoutely impoſſible, take what paines, and uſe what art one can, to ſtay a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
mind, which is naturall unto all of her ſex She is now ſwayed wholly by a young
ſtranger, who by killing <hi>Arganteus,</hi> has got a little reputation; he who by chance, and
not by any vertue that is in him, killed my Nephew before our faces; probably he had
uſed ſome treachery before we came, otherwiſe it is not likely he ſhould by plaine
ſtrength vanquiſh the valour and skill of <hi>Arganteus.</hi> Your reſentments of it at this time
has ſo much obliged me, as I ſhall never forget it as long as I live, but will be ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaſions to require you. But I am much afraid the meanes of doing it will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of my power ere long, unleſſe you will arme your ſelves with ſtout reſolutions,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53527:66"/>
and follow my directions. <hi>Amaſis</hi> to gratifie this new up-ſtart, has commanded me to
caſheir you out of my Liſt of Souldiers, with expreſſe charge to baniſh you this Country,
your own natural ſoil. This blow, though it hit you by the by, yet it will ſtrike me
down, and is done purpoſely to eſtabliſh this new comer in this Province, which ſhe is no
way able to doe, but by taking from me that Authority which my Services have gotten.
She conceives that if ſhe ſhould do it all at once, and upon a ſuddain perhaps I might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
her; and therefore ſhe undermines me by degrees, thinking that the greater the
building is, it will the ſooner fall by its own weight: And to begin her worke, ſhe firſt
takes from me my beſt friends, ſuch as you are: I know her drift well enough, and if all
things go well, as I hope they will, I ſhall ere long prevent theſe diſorders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as things

that can befall me, but if you have ſtill the ſame courage which I have ſeen in
you, I am confident you will ſend him out of the world, who would ſend you out of
your native Country: It is a matter of no difficulty, for he is a ſingle man; he is not
able to reſiſt one of you, much leſſe all ſix. Do but kill his Horſe that he cannot run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and the victory is yours. As for <hi>Amaſis,</hi> ſhe will be highly enraged at the firſt, and
would be revenged upon thoſe that tooke from her her vnew <hi>Adomis;</hi> but her anger
will be onely a blaſt of wind, and quickly over: For he being a ſtranger, none will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
in his behalf: I mean, none will care for his death; beſides, I know your diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as when you have done the buſineſſe, you can be cloſe, ſo as none ſhall have the leaſt
ſuſpition of you. Then, when all the power is in my own hands, be aſſured that you ſhall
not feare any danger, whatſoever become of my ſelf. Conſider well upon it, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
that I may know what to doe, both for you, and for my ſelfe, in a buſineſſe of
this importance.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Souldiers were ſoon perſwaded by ſuch an Orator, and promiſed to attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ſtranger what he had propounded; as for their parts, they had no other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
but to obey him; and at the danger of their lives, to keep up his grandure and
authority.</p>
                     <p>This attempt being thus reſolved upon, the next morning, he aſſembled together all thoſe
who were with him that day, and who had aſſaulted <hi>Damon;</hi> and told them, that by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
command from <hi>Amaſis,</hi> he commanded them, not onely to retire from his ſervice,
but to depart the Country within ſix days; that he was ſorry to treat them ſo but he muſt
obey; that they muſt not fail upon paine of death; and yet not being able to forget
thoſe good ſervices which he had received from them, he promiſed to obtaine the favour
of <hi>Amaſis</hi> for them, as ſoon as he could, and to get them reſtored into their former ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
And that they might be better able to ſubſiſt in the meane time, beſides their pay
which <hi>Amaſis</hi> allowed for the time paſt, he would out of his own purſe give them three
moneths pay: deſiring them not to be angry with him for it; but to believe that he did
execute this command with much griefe, being very ſorry to part from thoſe that with ſo
much valour and fidelity had ſerved him, and in whom he had great confidence. By
this ſmooth language and ſhew of ſorrow to part with them, he did not onely get the
good will of thoſe who were diſmiſſed, but of all the Souldiers beſides; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
did ſteal away their hearts from <hi>Amaſis,</hi> which was no ſmall advancement to the
deſign which he had plotted in himſelfe; for what he took from her, redounded unto
his advantage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adamas,</hi> who was extreamly deſirous to welcome all the good company in his houſe,
and particularly to make good his promiſe unto thoſe faire ſhepheardeſſes, in going unto
their Town to offer the ſacrifice of Thanks; as ſoon as it was day, he ordered the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
to go before with their Cattle, and other things neceſſary; and to give notice unto
all the neighbouring Towns to be preſent. And whilſt he was putting all things in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the fair <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and all the reſt of the company, did dreſſe themſelves, and took
the way unto the place where the Sacrifice was to be offered. <hi>Alexis,</hi> amongſt all the reſt,
was moſt out of tune; for at firſt going out, when ſhe caſt her eye upon the River of
<hi>Lignon,</hi> and ſaw the place of her habitation: She did imagine that this voyage was
not reall, but a dream onely. As ſhe was walking down a little hill with <hi>Aſtrea, Hylas</hi>
did ſo awake her by his diſcourſe, as ſhe perceived it no dream, but a reall voyage; and
then ſhe was ſo full of contentment, that every one might perceive it in her eyes and face.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53527:67"/>
                        <hi>Aſtrea</hi> on the other ſide, who could not wiſh for more happineſſe then to be with this
diſguiſed Druid, in whoſe face was ſuch a lively picture of <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhe was ſo fully
contented, as almoſt forgetting the averſeneſſe of her paſt fortune, ſhe was now the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt
ſhepherdeſſe of <hi>Lignon.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Adamas</hi> did let her underſtand that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to lie this night with <hi>Phocion,</hi> and that <hi>Leenide</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> ſhould be there alſo;
ſhe diſpatched a meſſenger to give them notice.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time they all walked on, a gentle but a merry pace, ſome ſinging, others
talking, all doing ſomething or other to beguile the length of the way. <hi>Calidon</hi> who ſtill
had in memory the cruel anſwer which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> gave him, not having ſo much confidence
as to accoaſt her, yet not being able to conceale his diſpleaſure nor his extream affection,
he walked ſometimes before her, and ſung ſome verſes, which imported that to love her,
was recompence enough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hylas</hi> who was next him, and could not endure any of theſe obſtinate affections, as ſoon
as <hi>Calidon</hi> ended, he ſung ſome other verſes which imported, that Let them change that
that would, for his part he would never change. Every one did laugh at the
ſong of <hi>Hylas,</hi> and becauſe <hi>Stiliana,</hi> who walked with <hi>Carlis</hi> and <hi>Hermantes</hi> next
them, did hearken very attentively unto what <hi>Hylas</hi> ſaid; ſurely <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, thoſe who accuſe you of inconſtancy, doe you much wrong, ſince never was man
more conſtant than you are: For from the very firſt time I ever ſaw you untill now, you
were ſtill the ſame: Oh, good old Miſtreſſe, (ſaid he unto her) I wonder you ſhould not
know this before now, have all the men and women of our age ſo little wit, as not to
know this truth? This, replyed ſhe, and ſmiled, is a bad recompence for a good office;
you call me old Miſtreſſe, and doe you not know <hi>Hylas,</hi> that there is nothing under the
Sun more offends a woman than to be called old. I doe beleeve ſo, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but it is
ſo long ſince we were acquainted, that I thought it no injury. <hi>Daphnide,</hi> who was talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Adamas</hi> hearing thoſe that were about <hi>Hylas</hi> to laugh ſo heartily, and being
deſirous to know at what; ſhe inquired of <hi>Diana,</hi> who was next her, and ſhe acquainting
her with the cauſe; I muſt confeſſe ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> that his humour is the moſt pleaſant
that any one can meet with, in his kind; and I beleeve all the company would be very
ſorry to loſe him. But I beſeech you tell me, how long is it, ſince firſt he came amongſt
you; what moved him to come, and what buſineſſe has he here? To which Queſtions,
<hi>Diana</hi> anſwered, it is about four or five Months ſince firſt he came; as for the cauſe of
his ſtay, I thinke it is ſuperfluous to tell you, knowing his humour ſo well as you do, for
you may eaſily imagine it; but for the occaſion which brought him hither, I think none
knowes, except himſelfe, not that he is of ſo cloſe and retired a temper, as that he will
not tell any thing, but becauſe alwayes when he began to tell us his ſtory, either he has
been interrupted, or elſe time would not ſerve him to tell it out: And I aſſure my ſelfe,
Madam, if you would but intimate the leaſt deſire of knowing it, he would without
any difficulty tell it, for he thinkes himſelfe obliged unto any that will hearken unto
him in the relation of his fortunes.</p>
                     <p>I thinke, ſaid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> that it would be a very good diverſion, if he would entertaine
us with it, and the way would ſeeme leſſe tedious unto us: but the beſt way to bring him
to it, will be this faire Druid, ſaid ſhe, and pointed at <hi>Alexis,</hi> if ſhe would be pleaſed to
command him. <hi>Alexis</hi> hearing her ſelfe named, and ſeeing <hi>Daphnide</hi> point unto her, to
ſhew that ſhe was not too ſerious in her diſcourſe with <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> did aske her if ſhe had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſervice to command her, and knowing by <hi>Diana</hi> what ſhe deſired, I aſſure you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) that none has more power than your ſelfe, yet ſince you are pleaſed to
put me upon it, I will try what I can doe: Then calling unto him, Servant, ſaid ſhe, I
am growne very jealous. Faireſt Miſtreſſe, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you have no occaſion for it. Yes,
(ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) the occaſion is very great: For beſides the beauty of theſe faire ſtrangers,
which is occaſion enough; you know there is good reaſon to ſuſpect one of theft who is
accuſtomed to ſteale: You meane, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> and ſmiled, that I have been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ſteale away the hearts of thoſe who looke upon me, and you feare I ſhould doe
the like by theſe new ſhepherdeſſes; but never feare it, faireſt Miſtreſſe; for it may be I
ſhall commit this theft, but though I doe take their hearts, yet I promiſe you, they ſhall
not take mine, for it is only yours. This aſſurance, Servant, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> does pleaſe
me very well, but that is not my meaning: For it is, that theſe ſtrangers are very fair,
and you doe make it your glory and boaſt to love all thoſe who have any beauty. <hi>Hylas</hi>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:53527:67"/>
then going neerer <hi>Alexis,</hi> I perceive Miſtreſſe, ſaid he unto her, that you doe not yet know
after what manner I uſe to love. You muſt know that I uſe to doe as Merchants uſe;
when any of them has an intention to buy any commodity, they looke well upon it, and
conſider what it is worth, and lay by ſuch a ſtocke of money as is equall to the worth
and as far as that ſum will go, they will bid, and no farther, and when they have bought
the commodity, they value it at ſuch a ſum as they gave, and ſpend accordingly: Now
I uſe to doe the like; for when I firſt intend to love a Lady, I preſently looke upon her
beauty (for you muſt know that it is beauty which ſets the worth and value upon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
and when I have conſidered the full value of it, preſently I lay by a ſtocke of Love
in my ſoule, equall unto the price and value of beauty which ſhe has, and when I love, I
bid ſo much as that ſtocke comes unto, and ſpend upon it. Then, after I have ſpent all
that ſum in her ſervice, for whom I firſt laid it by, I have no more for her; but if I will
love, I muſt looke out for another beauty and lay by another ſum for it, ſo as in this, my
money and my love are alike; I mean, that when I have ſpent them, I can ſpend no more;
therefore Miſtreſſe, you might have ſome reaſon to feare, if I never had loved theſe new
ſhepherdeſſes before, but it is ſo long ſince I ſpent all ſtocke which I laid by for their
beauties as I have none left for them, my money is gone, and it will not come againe.
But Servant, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> Merchants that are rich, though they have once or twice emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
their purſes, yet will they fill them againe, to buy that at the ſecond bidding, which
they could not at the firſt. Perhaps they may, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> but Miſtreſſe, ſuch rich
Merchants and I am not alike; for they will chaffer and bid two or three times, whereas
I bid all at the firſt: beſides, if they have no money, they will borrow upon their credit,
and I ſpend and trade only upon my owne ſtock; This, replyed <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and ſmiled, is
the fineſt way of loving that ever it was my fortune to heare of. It is ſo, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> but
not very advantageous unto me, for I am affraid that you will quickly have ſpent your
ſtocke of Love, which you laid up for me, and then you will love me no longer. Tis
true indeed, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that, ſhould I ſpend it all, you could not hope for any more in
me, but that is abſolutely impoſſible; for when I firſt lay by a ſtocke of Love, I do make
it equal unto the beauty which I love, and yours being infinite, you muſt thinke that the
heap that I laid up to equall it, is a vaſt Mountaine. I am glad of it, replyed <hi>Alexis,</hi>
and eſteeming you as I doe, ſhould be very ſorry to loſe you; and this moves me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

you ſhould deſire mine ſhould be as big to you, leaſt this love ſhould be lame,

of the thing loved; and how doe you thinke I ſhould love you, unleſſe I know you?
Hidden treaſures are not eſtimable; your actions, I make no queſtion would render you of
high eſteem, if they were once known; and therefore if you do deſire that I ſhould love
you, than you muſt let me know the Story of your life, eſpecially at this time when

                     <head>The Hiſtory of Chryſide and Hylas.</head>
                     <p>IGnorance has this quality, that it cauſeth many things to be condemned, which in
themſelves are laudable: And this I have often found to be true, ſince I came amongſt
theſe ſhepherdeſſes about the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> where the falſe Tenents of <hi>Silvander</hi> are ſo
much followed, as all he ſayes is Oracle, and it is held an offence againſt the very Gods,
not to believe what ere he ſayes. This is an error ſo rooted in the opinion of all that fect,
as it is, in matter of Love, a crime of the higheſt nature, to contradict him. Yet I, who
am not ſwayed by opinion, but by truth; and who will not be convinced by words, but
by reaſons; I have ever followed that which reaſon dictates unto me, and bids me doe.
Can any be ſo irrationall as to blame experience, which is the mother and the Nurſe of
Prudence? yet talke to <hi>Silvander,</hi> or any of his hereticall ſect, and they will maintaine
it even with their lives that all experience is vicious and fallacious; and that they muſt
cleave unto their own errors, like ſnailes which once ſticking to a wall, muſt not part
from it: As if the Gods had not given us a judgement and reaſon to diſcern things that
are good, things that are better, and things that are moſt perfect.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Conſiderations, I beſeech you, faireſt Miſtreſſe, ſet before your eyes, when you
ſee that I have ſometimes loved and changed; and yet do not feare I ſhall change you for
any other, becauſe it is impoſſible to find one that is better or more perfect; For when
I am come once to the higheſt ſtep, I cannot go any higher. You are not the firſt, faireſt
Miſtreſſe, that has deſired to underſtand the ſequell of my ſtrange fortune; many others
have had the ſame curioſtry, and ſome in this company. What I have formerly related
into them, I will not relate now, becauſe they can inform you as well as I: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will onely tell you, that I am originally of <hi>Carmargues,</hi> where I began my Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip
with <hi>Carlis,</hi> and ended it with <hi>Stiliana.</hi> Afterwards, being but yet a noviſt in
my trade, I quitted that place and came to <hi>Lions,</hi> after that I had by the way loved the
faire <hi>Aymea,</hi> the fool <hi>Ploriante,</hi> and the ſad <hi>Cloris,.</hi> Then being come thither, I ſaw
<hi>Circena,</hi> whom, as my love unto her began in the Temple, ſo it dyed as ſoon as I was
out againe, and revived it ſelfe in the charitable <hi>Palinice;</hi> and from her was transferred
unto the kind <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> afterwards to the crafty <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and the proud <hi>Florice.</hi> And
becauſe <hi>Florice</hi> is the laſt I named, I will begin my diſcourſe where my love to her end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that you may the better underſtand what you deſire to know concerning my
life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Periander,</hi> a very brave Cavalier, and one that was paſſionately in love with <hi>Dorinde,</hi> to
pleaſe her, was a cauſe of my declining <hi>Florice,</hi> by ſtealing from me (though my friend)
ſome Letters which ſhe had written unto me: And <hi>Dorinde</hi> to be revenged both of her
and me, ſhewed them (like a ſpitefull woman as ſhe was) unto <hi>Theombres</hi> the husband
of <hi>Florice,</hi> who upon this, fell into ſuch a ſuſpition of her, as he carried her out of the
the Town, ſo as in a little time I began to forget her: for Miſtreſſe, I muſt ingenuouſly
confeſſe, that as my love began firſt by my eyes, ſo it ended as ſoon as it wanted nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from my eyes, according to that true Maxime <hi>Out of ſight, out of mind,</hi> and what
is far from the eye never troubles the heart. <hi>Florices</hi> ſtay out of Town a whole moneth
(a term long enough to kindle and extinguiſh a dozen ſeverall loves in me) had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to quench all my flames to her. But her ſtay being to continue a longer time, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
with my ſelfe to take my leave of her: for I could never like thoſe loves, that can
feed themſelves with thoughts and fancies, and fond imaginations. But finding Love to
be a fire, and my ſelfe burned with it, I thought the beſt Cure was by ſympathy, and to
cure my ſelfe by another fire; and in order to this, I ſought out for ſome new beauty
which might cure my old burn; and at laſt, heaven which alwayes favours deſignes that
are juſt, ſent me ſuch a fire as I ſtood in need of.</p>
                     <p>One evening as I was walking without any other deſign, but taking the air by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Arar,</hi> cloſe by a Bridge, and looking about, I eſpied three Coaches drawn by ſix Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
apeece: And becauſe that was amongſt us an equipage unuſual, I drew neerer the bridge
to ſee them paſſe. In one of them was four Ladies habited much different from our Mode,
and very rich; and their uncouth habits made me look upon them with more curioſity
and eagerneſſe. The firſt whom fortune fixed my eye upon, did keep it upon her as long as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53527:68"/>
I could ſee; She was in the firſt Coach, and ſeated in the beſt place; her hair was faire,
ſomething inclinable to Cheſnut; her Complexion, no dye could make a mixture of ſuch
perfect vermilion upon ſnow; her eyes black, but ſo quick, ſweet, and piercing, as no
heart had humour good enough to reſiſt them; her lips exact Corrall, her N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ck a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
of pureſt Alablaſter, and every part proportionable in perfection: as for her ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I could not perfectly ſee it, but as near as I could judge, it was neither tall nor lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:
as for her Hand, which ſhe often ſhewed in lifting up her haire which lay upon her
ſhoulder in curles, it could not be equalled unto any thing ſo well as to the whiteneſſe of
her neck.</p>
                     <p>Judge, Madam, whether ſuch a beauty could be looked upon and not loved; ſhe was
the fire by which I cured all my other burnings, ſo as quite forgetting <hi>Circinea, Palanice,
Dorinde,</hi> and <hi>Florice,</hi> I devoted my ſelfe wholly unto her. But perhaps you will thinke
it ſtrange, that ſhe being in a Coach, and onely paſſant, I ſhould obſerve ſo many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
in this beauty; but you muſt conſider, that I looked upon her with more eyes then
my own, and had thoſe of love to help me in looking upon this wonder. Nor muſt
you believe any ſuch thing which <hi>Silvander</hi> is often alleadging, that Love is blind: but
on the contrary, that thoſe who look with his eyes, can look through dreſſes and ſee ſuch
beauties as are hid from others. But it ſeems that love had a deſign upon me at this time,
for he would not let me make uſe of his eyes and my hands, but loadned the Coach hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
then it was before, becauſe it carried my heart away with it.</p>
                     <p>I ſee <hi>Silvander,</hi> you laugh; and I know you would ſay that the Coach was not a jot
more loadned for having my heart in it; but know, that my heart as light as it is, yet is
as heavy as yours. I know not that, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> but I am ſure the Coach which
carried your heart, had need go very faſt, or elſe your heart would quickly be out, for it
cannot endure to be long in a place. This ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> was <hi>Perianders</hi> opinion, when he
found me looking upon theſe ſtrangers as they paſſed. This good friend of mine percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me halfe out of my ſelfe, did begin to ſuſpect the cauſe; and coming unto me, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid he unto me; you will recover of this, I warrant you, as well as you
have done of others.</p>
                     <p>I anſwered him with a love ſick look; I ſee <hi>Periander,</hi> you mock me; but did you
know how great my pain was, you would pitty me, though I muſt confeſſe it proceeds
from love, Ah, ah, my friend, ſaid he and laughed, have a good heart; this is not the firſt
time you have been ſick of the ſame diſeaſe and never dyed. 'Tis true, ſaid I unto him,
then I did know who was the cauſe, but now I am ignorant of it: How friend? ſaid <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
and laughed; What? in love, and knows not with whom? So it is, ſaid I unto
him, and I cannot help it, Love has catcht me. That you do love, ſaid he, I doe believe,
but that you ſhould love, and not know her whom you doe love, though I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you in any thing elſe, yet in this I am incredulous: And if it be true, I ſay it is a
thing as eaſily done, as to perſwade any to believe it. Whether you believe it or no, ſaid
I, and ſighed, yet I am ſure it is ſo. How long, ſaid he, have you been ſick of this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical
diſeaſe? A little longer, anſwered I, then we have been talking of it. Upon this,
<hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ander</hi> laughed, and laying his hand upon my ſhoulder, ſaid; Well friend, if you be
long ſick of this diſeaſe, I will pay your Doctors: then he offered to go away, but I laid
hold upon his Cloak: What? ſaid I unto him, is this all the helpe and conſolation I
muſt expect from your friendſhip? What can I doe for you, anſwered he, as long as you
doe not know her that is the cauſe of your malady? You may help me, replyed I, and
contrive it how I ſhould come to the knowledge of her whom I adore. This is ſtrange
folly, ſaid he, Can I know her better then you doe? Why not, replyed I; Is it not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
for people in health, to tell ſick folks their diſeaſe, and to give them ſuch remedies
as they themſelves knew not? Ah, <hi>Periander,</hi> did you love me as well as you profeſſe,
you would not deny me that aſſiſtance which friendſhip requires. To which he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
In the name of Heaven, <hi>Hylas,</hi> what would you have me to ſay or doe? upon my
faith I think you are become a fool. A fool, ſaid I, is it folly to love her whom I adore?
ſhe whom I am ready to die for, will not yeeld unto any Goddeſſe in beauty; ſhe has
more Graces, then all the Graces themſelves; and if Love were not hood-winckt, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he would dote upon her: but the truth is, I know not who ſhe is. This is fine folly
indeed, replyed he; where, and when did you ſee her? Oh Heavens, ſaid I, are you
blind, that you could not ſee the Sun when it ſhin'd? Did you not ſee the Coaches which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53527:69"/>
paſſed by? In the firſt of them was ſhe whom I love, and know not, Is it ſo, ſaid he unto
me, then friend know, that you are a Priſoner unto a Priſoner; <hi>Gondebunt</hi> our King
did take them beyond the Alpes, and hath ſent them hither as Trophies of his
Victory.</p>
                     <p>Thus I underſtood who this faire ſtranger was, and had it not been very late I had
endeavoured to have ſeen her that night, but deferring untill the morning I retired to my
lodging ſo tormented that I could not reſt all the night. As ſoone as day appeared, I left
my bed: And becauſe <hi>Periander</hi> promiſed to accompany me to the Pallace, where we
might ſee them as they went to the Temple, and ſtaying in my Chamber till he came,
I took my Glaſſe, and trimmed my ſelfe up as gay as poſſibly I could, and kept ſuch a ſtirre
with curling my haire, and ſetting my ſelfe in a right quirpo, as none about me were able
to pleaſe me. Then taking the Glaſſe into my hand and and finding my haire appeared
a little too much of the gilded hue, alſo thinking that it would make but a bad impreſſion
in the fancy of women, I loaded my head with ſo much Cypreſſe powder, as it looked
more like the head of a Miller than the head of <hi>Hylas:</hi> And <hi>Periander</hi> ſuprizing me,
looked on a long while before I perceived him; at the laſt, turning about, and lifting
up my eyes, I ſaw him laughing. <hi>Periander,</hi> ſaid I unto him, you are no good friend of
mine, ſince in lieu of help and pitty, you laugh at me. And ſo I may very well, ſaid he,
and I cannot beleeve your paine to be ſo great, unleſſe Love in revenge of your folly, doe
make you find that in your ſelfe, which you would hardly beleeve in another. Wherein,
ſaid I, have I beene ſo incredulous? In that ſo great an affection cannot be
found, ſaid he, as will efface all other cares but ſuch as concerne, and depend
upon it.</p>
                     <p>You are in the right (ſaid I unto him) but did you ever ſee me ſo deſirous to pleaſe
any of thoſe I loved? Nay, put all the Loves I ever had unto this time together, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
all equall the affection which I have unto this one, and therefore you need not think
it ſtrange I ſhould be ſo carefull, and take more paines with my ſelfe for her, then for all
the reſt: For I know very well that the firſt impreſſions which are made in the minds of
women, are not eaſily blotted out. Thus talking to him, and ſtill tricking up my ſelfe
as fine as poſſibly I could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Come, come, ſaid he, and make an end of all your finerye, for
otherwiſe they will be gone before you come; then taking my hand, and pulling me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
by force from my glaſſe, he conſtrained me to follow him unto the Pallace, where
thoſe faire ſtrangers were lodged, unto which we were no ſooner come, but we ſaw them
going to the Temple, two and two together, holding hands.</p>
                     <p>I was ſo attentive in ſeeing them paſſe along, and obſerving which was ſhe who had
thus wounded me, that <hi>Periander,</hi> by way of mockery whiſpered me in the ear; take
heed, ſaid he, that ſhe whom you admire ſo much, doe not paſſe by, and you not know
her; ſhould my eyes commit ſuch a fault, ſaid I, I would pull them out, and they ſhould
never deceive me againe. Well, well, ſaid he, I am much miſtaken if ſhe be not paſt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
Is it poſſible, replyed I preſently, doe you not mocke me? Upon this, not ſtaying
for any anſwer, I ran a little forward, that I might ſee them paſſe againe; but then I
found <hi>Periander</hi> onely mocked me, for preſently after, I ſaw her whom I expected, the laſt
of them all, adorned with ſo many beauties, as ſhe attracted the eyes of all upon her. This
ſecond viſion did ſo raviſh me, that I knew not what I did, onely I remember that when
ſhe paſſed before me, I could not chuſe but ſay with a deepe ſigh; <hi>Here comes the faireſt
of all;</hi> and it hapned, of all theſe Strangers none but ſhe underſtood the language of
<hi>Gaule,</hi> ſo as I obliged her without diſobliging the reſt, becauſe they underſtood me not;
for moſt certainly to undervalue a womas beauty is a wound almoſt incurable. And on
the contrary, of all flatteries none more pleaſing unto them than thoſe that applaud their
beauties, for let it be never ſo groſſe, yet it will be beleeved true. The Temple was a good
diſtance from the Pallace, and yet I found it ſo ſhort, that I thought the way ſo ſhort, as
they were there before I imagined it halfe way, and I thought the Sacrifice ſo ſhort, as it
was ended before I thought it begun, and this becauſe I received ſuch extreame content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in looking upon this fair ſtranger, and my eye was never off as long as the Sacrifice
laſted. Theſe Ladies alſo were as full of curioſity as we, and were not ſo fervent in their
devotions, but they would ſometimes looke round about the Temple, and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that this faire Stranger never turned her eye towards me, but ſhe ſaw mine fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:53527:69"/>
Then <hi>Diana</hi> ſmiled and ſaid, <hi>Hylas</hi> I muſt needs interrupt you a little, and put you in
mind you doe not blaſpheme <hi>Veſta</hi> and the good Goddeſſe. Temples were made to pray
unto the Gods and not for any amorous deſignes; Why, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> will not the Gods
permit us to doe that on earth, which they themſelves doe in Heaven? Then, not ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for <hi>Dianas</hi> anſwer, he full into his diſcourſe again.</p>
                     <p>The Sacrifice being ended, they returned in the ſame order as they came; and as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
was, at their coming out of the Temple, which as you know ſtood high, and had
many ſteps to deſcend from it, this Faire one looking another way, and wearing very high
ſhooes, ſhe fell at the laſt ſtep, but without receiving any hurt: I who had my eye conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
upon her, ran preſently to her, and taking her by the arm, I helped her up, with
ſo much contentment unto my ſelfe, as I thought all the paines I tooke that day very well
imployed, having done her this triviall ſervice, which as ſhe ſince confeſſed was the firſt
knowledge ſhe had of my good will; and this was the reaſon why ever ſince in all my
other affections, I did never omit the leaſt occaſion, though never ſo triviall, which might
be any way ſerviceable unto thoſe I loved, obſerving from hence, that in imitation of
good Fencers, it is better to make many blows, though they be not mortall, then to ſtay
all the day for one ſingle blow, becauſe he is very ignorant in the miſtery that cannot
defend himſelfe from one blow; but when he fals on pell mell, and gives blow after blow;
it is almoſt impoſſible but ſome ſhould take effect. In this I doe hint particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at <hi>Silvander,</hi> who is ſo proud, that he will never doe any leſſe ſervice unto his Miſteſſe
than the ſaving of her life, thinking that other leſſe ſervices doe not deſerve to be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
accompt.</p>
                     <p>

Company upon him, eſpecially <hi>Diana,</hi> as if ſhe expected ſomething from him, he thought
himſelfe obliged to ſpeak. <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid he, I doe confeſſe part, and part diſavow what
you doe ſay of my humour; for ſuch trifling ſervices as doe not merit the name of ſervice,
and are no more than common Complements, they are not worthy of ſuch accompt, as you
doe make of them, ſince the greateſt ought to be blotted out of the memory of him who
renders them. How, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and ſhoke his head, muſt one blot out of memory a
long ſervice? Why then ſhould one ever doe them, if things paſt muſt be forgotten? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it my good friend <hi>Silvander,</hi> women will eaſily conſent unto ſuch a Law, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
which is their Nature, is the mother of Oblivion; but I have ſo obſerved the
ſervices which I have done them, as if they doe ſeeme not to remember them, or to take
no notice of them, I ſhall tell them of it, as they ſhall be deafe if they doe not apprehend
them. And to tell you truly, I beleeve if your ſervices did merit as much as mine, you
would not ſet ſo low a rate upon them, or to ſay better, you would not make ſuch good
uſe of them: As for me, I doe thinke the very leaſt ſervice I doe, does deſerve a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
Did I not know, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> and ſmiled, that the Iſle of Camargue is
your Country, I ſhould thinke ſeeing you ſet ſo great a value upon a little, that you were
borne in a certaine Country of the <hi>Gaules</hi> where the Inhabitants have three qualities
which are not much unlike your humour. What are they? ſaid <hi>Hylas.</hi> I would not
willingly tell them, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> but ſince you urge me, you ſhall know.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that they are rich, yet have but a little; The ſecond is, they are Doctors,
yet have but a little learning; And the laſt is, they are extreamly proud, yet have but a
a little honour. <hi>Hylas</hi> would have anſwered halfe in anger, but the laughter was ſo lowd
that he could not. And afterwards when he offered to ſpeake, <hi>Silvander</hi> was before him,
and with a ſmile, ſaid, let it ſatisfie you <hi>Hylas,</hi> that I ſaid not this of the Province of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> where you were borne; but if you thinke your ſelfe obliged unto ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
of it, I give you leave with all my heart to ſay as much of the place where I
was borne, if you pleaſe. No queſtion, replyed <hi>Hylas</hi> preſently, but that if your
Country were not as much unknown to me as to your ſelfe, I ſhould not be long mute, but
ſhould ſay as much for you, and with more truth, yet not knowing where this ſtrange
Land is, one may eaſily judge that it produces nothing but ruſhes and thiſtles, ſince it
hath ſent forth ſuch pricking and biting ſpirits as yours. To which <hi>Silvander</hi> having
no mind to reply, becauſe he would not hinder him from his ſtory; <hi>Hylas</hi> after a little
ſilence, continued thus.</p>
                     <p>The cuſtome of the ancient Towne of <hi>Lyons</hi> which is to welcome and entertaine all
ſtrangers, and moſt religiouſly to obſerve all Lawes of Hoſpitality, was a cauſe that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſonte</hi>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:53527:70"/>
Aunt unto <hi>Periander,</hi> a few dayes after the arrivall of theſe faire ſtrangers, did
enquire of thoſe who had the guard of them whether it would be permitted to viſit them,
and underſtanding that the King was very well pleaſed to allow it, ſhe went unto them,
and offered unto them all manner of aſſiſtance and ſervice; ſhe had a daughter called <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinda,</hi>
who was not unhanſome: This daughter was at the firſt viſit ſo much pleaſed with
theſe Ladies, and ſo was <hi>Amaſonte,</hi> that they went very often afterwards to ſee them.
By fortune the greateſt intimacy they had, was with that Fair one who had ſo captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me. And it was, as I beleeve, beſides thoſe perfections which ſhe had above the reſt of
her companions, becauſe ſhe ſpoke the <hi>Gaul</hi> language, and becauſe ſhe had been brought
up in thoſe Countries, <hi>Periander</hi> acquainting me with theſe paſſages, I told him, that
he muſt needs contrive it ſo by any means, that this good Aunt of his did might us admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
without acquainting her with any deſign.</p>
                     <p>And we parting in this reſolution, that ſame day <hi>Periander</hi> dining with his Aunt,
ſeemed to be inquiſitive in hearing her to tell of theſe ſtrangers, and enquired very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
how they behaved themſelves, and whether they were civill and affable, to
whom <hi>Amaſonte</hi> and <hi>Orſinda,</hi> both giving very high and advantageous Characters of
them, he feigned an extream deſire of ſeeing and talking with them. If you will, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Orſinda,</hi> you may go with my Mother and me, ſo ſatisfie your curioſity. 'Tis
true, ſaid <hi>Amaſonte,</hi> if men may be permitted to viſit them, and of that I have not
enquired: but to morrow I promiſe you to ask the queſtion, whether any men have yet
or may be admitted, and if any have been allowed, you ſhall I warrant you, as ſoon as
any. And indeed; the good Aunt was as good as her word; for the next morning ſhe
underſtood that any might come and viſit them; for the King did not feare any could
ſteal them away, having them ſo farre from home.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Periander</hi> brought me this newes, it was not unwelcome unto me, as you may
well imagine, eſpecially when I heard, that the next day in the afternoon, they would
conduct us thither. The day ſeemed ſo long to my impatience, as I asked what a clock
it was, above a hundred times, thinking the Sun a ſluggard and ſlower then uſual: I was
no leſſe unquiet all the night, nor had any more patience all the morning, untill
the hour came, when <hi>Periander</hi> was to go unto the Palace Royall; there I ſo well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
my time, as when they came to the Gate I met them, and ſeeming as if the
meeting was meerly accidentall; I asked <hi>Periander</hi> whither he was going? He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he was to wait upon his Mother (for ſo he called <hi>Amaſonte</hi>) then ſhe addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her ſelfe unto me, and ſaid, If, Sir, you be a friend, you will not leave <hi>Periander</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
upon this occaſion, I will never enquire what it is, ſince you command me, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, and ſince it is to ſerve my friend. And as I ſaid ſo, I took <hi>Orſinda</hi> by the arm;
<hi>Periander</hi> could not chuſe but laugh, when he ſaw me ſeem ſo ignorant of the voyage,
and the readineſſe I uſed in taking hold of the occaſion. Thus we entred into the place
where the ſtrangers were; and at the firſt, I ſaw the faire one whom I ſo much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
come with open arms, a ſmiling countenance, and great demonſtration of good will
unto <hi>Orſinda,</hi> whoſe happineſſe I envied.</p>
                     <p>After the firſt ſalutations and complements of courſe, <hi>Amaſonte</hi> deſiring I ſhould
receive ſome good looks from this faire Priſoner, by her meanes, did let her underſtand
who we were, acquainted her with the great intimacy betwixt <hi>Periander</hi> and me, and
with the deſire we had to doe them any ſervice: and therefore addreſſing unto us, ſhe
ſhewed her ſelfe as ſweetly kind, as civility would permit her: Then turning towards me,
ſhe remembred how I helped her up when ſhe fell at the Temple ſtairs. I perceive, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſaid I unto her, One ſhall never complaine of any ſervices done unto you, ſince
you can ſo well remember ſo ſmall a matter; Though our Ladies in <hi>Gaul</hi> either out
of pride or want of memory, doe not onely forget ſmall ſervices, but alſo the greateſt
one can do them. I pray, Sir, ſaid ſhe unto me, how can you attribute this unto their pride.
They have ſuch a high opinion of their own merits, anſwered I, as they thinke all the
world is obliged to ſerve them: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd receiving all our ſervices as but due debts, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
them, and deſpiſing them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> not daign to remember them. Sir, ſaid ſhe unto me
and ſmiled you deſcribe your Ladies to be of a very ſtrange humour. But take heed leſt
what you ſay, doe not proceed from ſome other occaſion: Our ſex is ſo the Butt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
that we are very often conſtrained to ſeem as if we did not ſee things, which
yet we doe ſee as well as men themſelves; and in this, we are rather to be pittied then
blamed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:53527:70"/>
                        <hi>Periander</hi> and <hi>Orſinda,</hi> were retired a little on the other ſide, and purpoſely that
might have ſome diſcourſe with her, whilſt <hi>Amaſonte</hi> entertained the other ſtrangers:
This incouraged me to be more bold in my anſwer. Had theſe Ladies, whom you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
excuſe ſo much, replyed I, but ſuch bodies, and ſuch wits, and ſpirits, as you
have, though they were much more cruel then they are, yet would they need no excuſes;
for then, be they never ſo auſtere, yet would they not onely be ſerved, but even adored
by all men.</p>
                     <p>This language did not at all ſtartle her, but with a ſmiling eye ſhe anſwered thus: I ſee,
Sir, flattery is in uſe here in <hi>Gaul,</hi> as well as amongſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> I thought it h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been beyond the Alpes, but I perceive the <hi>Gaules</hi> who are reported to ſpeak from their
hearts, have it amongſt them, as well as other people. Madam, anſwered I, I cannot
tell whether your Nation doe call truth flattery, or whether to flatter be in your language
to ſpeak truth; but I doe ſweare and proteſt by our <hi>Great Tautates,</hi> which is the deepeſt
oath I can take, that I did never in all my life ſee any face comparably ſo fair as yours,
nor any wit ſo good and perfect as yours is.</p>
                     <p>Thus, Miſtreſſe, I continued my diſcourſe, and before we parted, I did let her underſtand,
that I had a deſire to doe her particular ſervice: perhaps you will think it ſtrange, I
ſhould thus at the firſt make this remonſtrance unto her; but you muſt know, that my
humour was not to languiſh it out in amorous Trances, nor to let my eyes be Orators as
long as my tongue could tell her my heart. For I ever thought that delayes doe rather
marre then make it better, and that in love, not to vanquiſh quickly, is to be vanquiſhed;
but the principal motive why I would no longer deferre the declaration of my affection
unto this faire ſtranger, was a double conſideration, which at that time I had in my
mind: I conſidered that ſhe was in the power of another, and not as others are under a
Mother or Parents: but a Priſoner of War, and kept by command from <hi>Gondebert,</hi> as
the reſt of her companions were. And becauſe it was hard to know what deſigne he had
upon her, I feared leſt this opportunity ſhould be taken from me, either by being guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more ſtrictly, or removed unto ſome other place. I conſidered alſo, that ſhe came from
beyond the Alpes, where the women are much bolder to attempt what they deſire, and
execute what they attempt, then our women of <hi>Gaul</hi> are: I ſound this to be their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
by my converſe in <hi>Camargue,</hi> and in the Town of <hi>Arles,</hi> which made me think that
this faire one would not derogate from her Climate, nor thinke this ſuddain declaration
ſtrange.</p>
                     <p>Following therefore the genius of her Country and my own, I did acquaint her with
my affection. And though perhaps my words were not at the firſt taken as proceeding
from love, but civility; yet however, they did break the Ice, and facilitate the way to my
enſuing addreſſes, and made her believe that which I did deſire to perſwade her of: I had
an opinion that ſhe had no thoughts which tended unto what I deſired; and yet ſhe took
more pleaſure in talking with me, then with <hi>Periander,</hi> or any that came to viſit her;
ſhe thinking that this affection which tyed me unto her, did oblige her to truſt more in
me. And though I had no other knowledge of her good will then this, yet I can truly
ſay, that there were very few things which ſhe did not communicate unto me, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo private or important; and within a moneth after the firſt time I had ſeen her, there
was ſo great familiarity betwixt us, as ſhe advertiſed me, how ſhe and her companions
intended to walk in the <hi>Athenian</hi> Iſle at the evening, in a Garden which was where the
<hi>Roſne</hi> and <hi>Arar</hi> met, a place very pleaſant, both in variety of Wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, and Groves of
Trees. I reſolved not to miſs this appointment, as well becauſe I had no other exerciſe
nor deſign, as becauſe I thought ſhe would be much offended if being ſo ſecretly adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of it, I ſhould let ſlip that opportunity which ſhe gave me. When ſhe ſaw me firſt,
ſhe ſeemed unto her Companions, as if the meeting were by chance and not deſigne.
What fortune brought you hither, <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto me, where my companions and
my ſelfe did think to paſſe away the reſt of the day unſeen by any? This diſſimulation of
the matter, did pleaſe me very well. For it is a good ſigne of love, to hide from others
the addreſſe which is made unto any Lady. And to ſecond her in her artifice, I anſwered
very faintly. It is impoſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Madam, but that the fortune which brought me hither
ſhould be good, ſince I am ſo happy in meeting ſuch company; and it would be much
better, if I knew any way how to doe you any acceptable ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who began to underſtand a little of our language did thanke me in moſt pittifull
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53527:71"/>
broken words, yet as kindly as they could, and went away into ſeverall walkes, leaving
us two together as we deſired to be. I tooke her therefore under the Arm, and began to
walke, but leaſt ſhe ſhould thinke ſo much familiarity ſtrange, I ſaid unto her, though
this Madam be not the cuſtome and faſhion of your Country, yet it is in <hi>Gaule,</hi> and
therefore I beſeech you take it not ill, if I uſe our owne priviledges, and by taking your
arme doe helpe you to walke, <hi>Hylas,</hi> anſwered ſhe, your kindneſſe unto me obligeth me
unto more familiarity than this: Tis true, that the condition wherein I am will not let
me acknowledge it more than in words, ſo as I cannot require your amity as I ought to
doe; upon this I obſerved her to ſigh and change colour, as if the thought of her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did exceedingly trouble her: And being very deſirous to know the particular cauſe
of her ſadneſſe, after many thankes for her kind expreſſions, I beſeeched her to let me
know what Fortune brought her into this Country, and what ſtayed her in it: And
becauſe it is no ſmall advantage (marke well <hi>Silvander</hi> what I ſay) to know the fortunes
and humours of thoſe, whoſe favour we deſire, I was the more urgent with her: For I
ſhould be thereby the better inſtructed what will pleaſe, and what will diſpleaſe her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
ſaid ſhe, doe you not know that I am a Priſoner unto King <hi>Gondebunt,</hi> and how
much my Companions and I am obliged unto him? And I anſwering that I knew it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by vulgar report. Then anſwered ſhe, I ſhall acquaint you with thoſe particulars
which you deſire; and you ſhall heare the moſt lamentable Adventure that ever
befell a poore woman; onely I beſeech you to be very ſilent in it, and impart it
unto none.</p>

                     <p>This Country is very well known unto the <hi>Romans</hi> by reaſon of the many Gold Mines
which are in it, and for which the Inhabitants of the place have beene forced to revolt ſo
often. I have made this deſcription of my Country unto you, that you may the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what was foretold my Father when I was borne, by a female Druide, who came
out of <hi>Gaw</hi> into this Country, by the command (as ſhe ſaid) of a great God, whoſe name
was unknown unto us, and I think it was by him whom you did ſwear. Is it <hi>Tautates;</hi>
ſaid I unto her? The ſame, anſwered ſhe whom this woman ſaid was a great God, and all
others depended upon him, Now this female Fortune teller came to my Fathers houſe,
at the ſame time when my Mother was delivered of me: And my Father ſeeing her look
very earneſtly upon me, he asked her what my fortune would be: It will be, anſwered
ſhe, like unto the Country where ſhe is borne. This anſwer was very darke: But
ſome yeares after ſhe chanced to come againe unto the ſame place, and my Mother being
very inquiſitive did preſſe her to explaine her former prediction. To whom ſhe anſwered,
that this woman ſhall have the ſame fortune which the Country wherein ſhe was borne
hath; the <hi>Romans</hi> by reaſon of the Gold found there have ſo harraſſed the people by wars,
as it is almoſt depopulated, ſo as her abundance is the cauſe of her poverty; even ſo ſhall
this your daughter be very much troubled by reaſon of her beauty and merit. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
this Druid was very knowing; for I have found ever ſince, that never was
woman more croſſed by fortune than my ſelfe, as you may judge by the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                     <p>I was born, as I told you, amongſt the <hi>Sallaſes,</hi> in a Town called <hi>Eporides,</hi> ſeated between
two great Hils, where the golden <hi>Baltea</hi> runs: my Father was called <hi>Leander,</hi> and my
mother <hi>Luira,</hi> and though my owne praiſes be not hanſome out of my owne mouth, yet
that you may the better underſtand the ſequell of this diſcourſe, you muſt know, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53527:71"/>
there was none in all the Country, who did not yeild unto my Father, in grandure, in
antiquity of Family, in offices which he poſſeſſed, or in authority which he had gotten,
as well by his owne merit, as by the favour of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and ſince of <hi>Vaelentinian,</hi> and all
thoſe who ſince him ruled over <hi>Italy,</hi> who advanced him unto that height, that if his
death had not prevented it, when the Empire was in decline, doubtleſſe he had not only
made himſelfe Soveraigne Lord over the <hi>Sallaſes,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Libices,</hi> of the <hi>Centrons</hi>
and of the <hi>Veragrois.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This his death was the firſt blow which I received from Fortune &amp; did not reſent it, for
want of capacity: For, being but nine yeares of age, I knew not what it was to loſe a
Father, and to be at the diſpoſition of a mother who was more carefull of her ſelfe than
her Children, yet I lived very contentedly till I came to be fourteen of fifteen years old, for
till then. Fortune did not thinke me able to feele the weight of her blows; and ſee how
ſubtilly ſhe undermined me: for ſhe gilded over her bitter pils of poyſon with a gloſſe of
good, knowing very well (cruell one as ſhe is) that any miſery that comes under the
ſhrowd of a happineſſe, makes it ſelfe much more ſenſibly reſented.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame Towne where I was, did dwell very many Cavaliers: for that <hi>Gaul,</hi> which
is called <hi>Ciſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>pine</hi> is not as it is here, for I have heard, that here Cavaliers and men of
quality doe live in the Country. Amongſt the reſt, there was one young <hi>Libicinian</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
who certainly was as much favoured by Nature in all the graces ſhe could beſtow, as
was poſſible; nor did he want any nobleneſſe of Anceſtors, nor alliance to the beſt Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
nor any other good quality that could poſſibly be deſired, but only Riches; and in
that, he was little beholding to his Father, who was all his life more thirſty after the
acquiſition of Honour than Wealth, little conſidering that the one without the other is
like a bird that has good wings, yet has ſuch a clog at her foot that ſhe cannot fly. This
young man did dwell in <hi>Eporides</hi> by reaſon of the hatred which <hi>Rhithimer</hi> bore unto his
Father. I ſuppoſe, <hi>Hylas,</hi> you have heard, how this <hi>Rhithimer</hi> though a <hi>Goth</hi> by Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet through his valour and good conduct was made a Citizen of <hi>Rome;</hi> afterward,
Patrician, and laſtly Governour of <hi>Gaul Ciſalpine,</hi> or indeed, rather the Lord of it; for
his Commiſſion was ſo large, and his authority ſo abſolute, that he might be called Lord
as well as Governour. The Father of <hi>Arimant</hi> (for ſo was the young man called) had
moſt juſt occaſion to feare his Enemy; For though otherwayes he was very well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
yet he had ever in him the Nature of a <hi>Goth:</hi> And this was the reaſon why he
came into this Towne that he might ſo much the ſooner goe out of <hi>Italy,</hi> in caſe
he was forced to it, either by the <hi>Centrons,</hi> by the <hi>Veragrois,</hi> or by the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This young Cavalier of whom I ſpeake did accidentally ſee me at a marriage which
was kept in the houſe of one of my Cozens. The cuſtom of the Country is, that upon ſuch
occaſion, entrance is permitted unto all as freely as into Churches. I ſay that as ill
lucke was, he ſaw me there: For there he fell in love with me, and this love was the
ſcource both of all his miſeries and mine. He tooke occaſion to declare his love unto me
in a Ball, wherein many uſe to dance at once by two and two, walking only round the
roome, and obſerving the cadency a little. The name of it was the great Ball, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
purpoſely to give a hanſome opportunity unto Cavaliers of talking unto Ladies.
<hi>Arimant</hi> tooke me out, and though it was with a deſigne of diſcovering his affection,
yet was it long before he durſt begin; yet at laſt, leaſt he ſhould loſe ſuch an opportunity
as was hard to be met with againe, he forced himſelfe, and ſaid thus unto me. Fair <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiede</hi>
ſaid he unto me (for he had enquired my name) the Iawes of this Country are too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid,
if not unjuſt, in keeping ſo cloſe, that which is moſt faire: I doe not know (ſaid I
unto him) upon what you doe ground your ſpeech. Upon cuſtome, anſwered he, which
is to keepe the Ladies up ſo cloſe: as that they ſhew themſelves ſo ſeldome, as a man can
hardly ſay he ſees them, and not to goe farre for an example: Is it not extreame cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
I ſhould be ſix Months in this Towne, and this is the firſt time I have the happineſſe
to ſee you? Faire Ladies Sir, ſaid I unto him, doe conceale themſelves upon very good
conſideration. For too often ſeene, too much contemned: But why ſhould you put me
in the Catalogue of faire ones, or complaine of ſeeing me ſo ſeldome? Since certainely
the ſight of me muſt needs be very indifferent unto you? It is too much, ſaid he and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to overcome one perſon twice; it was enough your eyes had already got the victory
over me, without doubly ſurmounting me by the ſweetneſſe and charms of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
wit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:53527:72"/>
This ſuddaine declaration did ſurpriſe me, yet I cannot tell how, it did not offend me,
and I anſwered him thus. You are eaſily overcome, Sir, if vanquiſhed by ſuch ſimple
arms, as your Conqueror is owner of; and ſince ſhe never ſo much as thought of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
this victory. However, ſaid he, I am vanquiſhed, and I am neither aſhamed
nor ſorry, for being vanquiſhed by ſuch arms.</p>
                     <p>I knew not all this while, who this young Cavalier was, having never ſeen him before:
yet ſince he was ſo confident as to addreſſe himſelfe unto me, I did imagine him a man
of principall Rank amongſt the <hi>Sallaſes;</hi> his hanſome preſence, and the expreſſion of
his affection, made me very deſirous to know his name: And I muſt confeſſe I had been
put hard to it for an anſwer, if the Ball had continued longer. But it being ended, I had
opportunity to enquire of what I deſired. He who began to be ſenſible of loves firſt blows,
which commonly are full of impatience, and who thought that perhaps it would be long
before he had ſuch another opportunity, he took me out to dance againe although it
was not the cuſtome; but being grown more bold, and a better husband of his time, he
ſaid thus unto me; I have been aſſured, that faire ones will never believe things that
are true, and rather hearken unto things things that are not ſo. Though I ſhould leave it
unto fair ones, to give you an anſwer (ſaid I) yet ſince they doe not hear, I will aske
you, why you accuſe them of that fault? Becauſe, anſwered he, I find it ſo in you. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me, fair <hi>Cryſide,</hi> if I offend you. Why do not you believe me, when I ſay that I am
your moſt devoted ſervant, for it is moſt true? <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mant,</hi> ſaid I, words onely cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
me to believe what you ſay, ſince reaſon gives your tongue the lye; and ſince I
know that men make profeſſion of giving much for a little money. If it be ſo, ſaid he,
then I doe proteſt that I am not a man. What are you then, replyed I preſently? I am,
ſaid he, your ſervant, and the moſt faithfull and zealous ſervant that ever was. I muſt
needs confeſſe, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that his noble extraction, and his neat wit, had obliged me to
give him another kind of anſwer then I did, but for ſome other conſiderations which
hindred me, and therefore I onely ſaid thus unto him; we ſhall ſee <hi>Arimant,</hi> whether
you continue in the ſame mind the next time we meet, and I will deferre my anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
then.</p>
                     <p>The Ball now ended and the company parted, for it was ſupper time, and doe what
he could, I would not give him any opportunity of ſpeaking unto me againe, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that for the firſt time he might be very well contented with ſuch anſwers as he had
received. And becauſe the joy for this marriage continued many dayes, the next day,
and as oft as the meetings continued, he did not omit any opportunity of teſtifying the
truth of his expreſſions: which at the laſt, I was perſwaded to believe, and to ſatisfie him
ſo farre, as to let him thinke I loved him. 'Tis true, I ſtayed until the very laſt day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I did ſo declare my ſelf unto him, leſt if I had done it ſooner, he ſhould pretend to any
greater favour, and had I tarried any longer, I could not have told him ſo much; but I
would not upon any terms, let him go without ſome aſſurance of my good will.</p>
                     <p>Since this time, it was long before we ſaw each other, except in Temples and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
places, which I muſt confeſſe did trouble me, becauſe indeed, I did begin to love him,
conſidering his diſcretion in the carriage of the buſineſſe, ſo as none could ſuſpect his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.
He would come often in the night to my window, and preſent me with ſome Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades:
but that was all the viſits I had from him.</p>
                     <p>My diſcourſe, kind <hi>Hylas,</hi> would be too long and tedious, if I ſhould relate all the
particulars of this Courtſhip. Let it ſuffice, that <hi>Arimant</hi> could not with diſcretion te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the good that he wiſhed unto me, although he ſought out all wayes, and neglected
no opportunity of doing it. Oh <hi>Hylas,</hi> how full of ſubtilty Love is? and though they
paint him but a boy, yet what old tricks he has? They are very ignorant who know it
not, or who think to maſter him. I know, and I know it by experience, and to my grief,
that they who would overcome him, muſt fight as thoſe doe who get their victory by
flying, for otherwiſe if they come to handy-blowes, he will get the better, it is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impoſſibly to reſiſt him: for he has ſo many tricks, and can uſe ſo many ſeverall ſorts
of Arms, as with one or other doubtleſſe if he doe not wound, yet at leaſt he will foile
and make ſcratches, and his weapons are alſo impoyſoned, that as ſoon as ever they draw
blood, there is no hope of health for him that is ſo wounded, for his wounds will ſo itch,
as he himſelfe will ſcratch them and make them ſore. Oh that I had known this before?
For, <hi>Hylas,</hi> at the firſt I did not admit of this addreſſe, but onely to ſee <hi>Arimant</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53527:72"/>
before my face, as a teſtimony of my beauty: Afterwards, his obſequiouſheſſe and
kindneſſe, moved me to look upon him a little better, and then his Noble Extraction,
his Merits, his Generoſity, and his Diſcretion, made me thinke very well of him, and a
little after, to eſteem him ſo, as I ſhould be ſorry to loſe him And love was no ſooner poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor
of heart, but preſently I was conſtrained to render it unto him, ſince time did put
me out of all doubt of his loving me. But I beſeech your conſider how ſuddenly my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
changed, when love had gotten this victory over me: As long as I did not love him,
I cared not at all who knew of his affection to me: but on the contrary, was very glad
it ſhould be divulged, as thinking that the more paſſionately he loved me, and the more it
was known, the more was the honour of my beauty. But then, as ſoon as I began to love
him, I cannot expreſſe how I was offended at the leaſt knowledge of it, in ſo much as
every time I talked of him, my principal charge was to be ſilent and ſecret, and carry all
cloſe. Our affaires then ſtanding upon theſe terms, and our affections growing every day
to a higher ſtraine, our onely endeavours were for hanſome occaſions to teſtifie them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
each other. But ſuch was the conſtraint in which the women beyond the mountaines
lived, being kept as it were Priſoners, as it was impoſſible for us to ſee one another, unleſs
by chance, nor to ſpeak together but in the preſence of ſome, and that too, very ſeldome.
This made him think upon an old woman, who got her living by going unto houſes and
ſelling Laces and Ribbands; that by her meanes we might ſpeak unto each other by
Paper, though not by voyce. He eaſily gained the woman, what by promiſes, and what
by Gifts. And ſhe coming to the houſe where I was, ſeeming to take meaſure of me for a
piece of Lace to a Gorget, and to that end drawing me to the window, ſhe would have
thruſt a Letter into my hand, ſaying not a word but onely <hi>Arimant.</hi> I knew well enough
it was a Letter from him, but being unwilling to be obliged unto the diſcretion or fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of this woman whom I knew not; and knowing well enough, that ſuch kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being inſinuators into the ſecrets of ſuch as are ſo fond as to truſt them, would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
prove very Tyrants, or elſe ſell their ſilence at ſo dear a rate, as it was impoſſible
to content them; I would not receive it, but on the contrary rejected it with ſuch ſharpe
language, yet low, that the poor woman was quite out of countenance, and carried it
back unto him that gave it her, intreating him to imploy her nomore in any ſuch matters.
He who thought it would have been very welcome to me, and hoped for ſome aſſurance
of my good will in the anſwer to it; ſeeing this refuſall, and hearing what ſharpe words
I uſed, he was the moſt aſtoniſhed man in the world; and not knowing unto whom to
complaine, he came that very night into our ſtreet with a conſort of Muſick, after they
had played a leſſon or two, and ſuppoſing I was come unto the window, he came juſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my window, and ſung ſome Verſes which contained a complaint that ſhe would not
receive his Letters.</p>
                     <p>I eaſily apprehended the reaſon of his complaint; and becauſe my refuſal did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

from want of affection, I thought my ſelfe obliged to advertiſe him of it; ſo as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                     <p>Now <hi>Hylas,</hi> you muſt know, that conſidering with my ſelfe, it was impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
this ſecret affection long, without a third perſon, becauſe as I told you before, the
conſtraint of women was ſo great as we knew not which way to meet: Therefore I
thought it a neceſſity to truſt my ſelfe unto ſome diſcreet perſon, who might both comfort
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53527:73"/>
and counſell me. In order unto this, I caſt my eye upon all that were in the houſe where
I lived, and found none more fit than my Nurſes daughter, who was brought up with me
and loved me ſo very well, as ſhe thought her ſelf happy in any ſervice ſhe could do me. This
wench was of my owne age, and ſuch a one, as I ſtood in need of; for ſhe had more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
than I, and was ſo ſtout as ſhe would often laugh at my feares and doubts. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
ſhe had wit at will, and was full of ſuch petty contrivances as I ſtood in need of. As
for her fidelity and diſcretion, I was ſo confident of them, as I durſt truſt her as ſoon as
my ſelfe with any ſecret: Moreover, ſhe did govern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> her owne Mother, who had the
guardianſhip of me, and lay in my Chamber. This was ſhe whom I made choice of for
my aſſiſtant, and acquainting her with what I thought expedient, I found her ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to my deſires, as at laſt I imparted the very b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ttome of my heart and that my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was never to love any but <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Clarina</hi> (for ſo was her name) conſidering the danger unto which I expoſed my
ſelfe, in throwing the Letter ſo out of the Window; ſhe found out an invention to write
with leſſe danger, and it was this. The evening before I intended he ſhould receive my
Letter from me it was agreed betwixt us, that I ſhould hang out a Hankercher out of
my window as if it were to dry, and by which we underſtood, that the next morning
at the time when others went unto the Temple, he was to go alſo; and where we ſaw
the greateſt throng of people there we would be, to prevent ſuſpition. If I could let a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Book fall, in which I ſhould ſeem to be at devotion, and none ſee, then I ſhould doe
it: otherwiſe when I went away, I ſhould pretend that I had careleſly left it behind me
in the place where I kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eled, or to let it fall ſome way or other when he ſaw me; and he
who had his eye ſtill upon me and who at that time was to be as near me as he could,
he ſhould preſently reach it up: if none ſaw, then he was to look into it; but if any did
perceive it, then he was to give me another which reſembled mine, and which was
made purpoſely alike. Now in theſe Books we writ our Letters, but with ſuch devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as were not eaſily diſcovered: my Mother and my Nurſe, have had theſe Bookes in
their hands ſeveral times, but could not make any thing of them, becauſe they underſtood
not the Charracters. Since this way was agreed upon, not a day paſſed, but we writ unto
each other, which was no ſmall comfort unto us in the conſtraint wherein we lived. But
Love was in this reſemblant unto Fire, which the more you feed it, the more it augments;
ſo did my favours unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> for they did ſo inflame his deſires, as not contented with
what I had done, he importun'd me by a thouſand ſupplications, to admit him into my
Chamber, unto which at laſt I conſented, ſo the meanes could be contrived, and ſo he
would promiſe to require no more of me, then I was willing to permit. This permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
being given unto him, his wits were at work, how to facilitate all theſe difficulties.
The firſt was, how to enter, but that was eaſily contrived; for by a Ladder made of
a Rope, which he would give unto <hi>Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ina,</hi> he might eaſily get into the window of her
Chamber when the caſement was open. But my Norſe whoſe bed was cloſe to mine,
and who was not of our conſpiracy, was a much greater difficulty unto us, and yet he
found out a remedy for that. There was in <hi>Epocedes,</hi> a very famous Mountebanke, who
had many moſt excellent receipts. This man was ſo much obliged unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> that
he was infinitely deſirous to ſerve him. Love adviſeth this young man to make addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
unto him, and to ask him for a Receipt which would cauſe ſleep; he who made a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
profeſſion of ſuch ſecrets, did give him an ointment, which being put under the
Noſe of the party that was faln aſleep, would ſo ſtupifie the ſenſes, as no noiſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
would awake the party until it was taken away. Before <hi>Arimant</hi> would make
uſe of it upon this occaſion, he tryed the operation of it upon one of his Domeſtiques,
who ſlept ſo foundly, that no ſhouting at his eare could awake him; but he removed
him from place to place, and he never ſtirred, until taking away the Box, and throwing
a little water in his face, and then he awaked.</p>
                     <p>All things being thus prepared, execution onely wanted. I muſt confeſſe, my heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
now to faile me; and when I conſidered the danger into which I ſhould put my ſelfe,
I wiſhed that a ſtop might be in the proceedings: But <hi>Clarina</hi> who was more couragious
then I, told me that I was gone too farr to retreat now; that had I put the Cavalier
out of hope at the firſt, he would not have been offended; but now as things ſtood, it
was a manifeſt wrong unto him and knew how to argue the matter ſo well, and to ſhew
the eaſineſſe of it, as at laſt I reſolved to goe through. Bed time being come, we all reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53527:73"/>
and ſeemed to take our reſt: and my good Nurſe who never dreamed of our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe,
by chance did fall aſleep ſooner then her cuſtome.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Clarina</hi> heard her ſnore, as ſhe uſed to doe when firſt ſhe ſlept, ſhe laid the
Box under her noſe, and called upon her as if ſhe was affrignted at her dream: but the
good old woman was ſo faſt, that if the houſe had falne, ſhe could not heare it. <hi>Clarina</hi>
joyed at this good beginning, did riſe from her ſleeping Mother, and helped me with my
Night-dreſſe, as ſhe pleaſed ſo to have it; For I proteſt <hi>Hylas,</hi> I was ſo farre beſides my

telling me that when Souldiers go to fight, they muſt put on their Arms that they may
get the victory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clarina</hi> ſaid unto her, you are a fool, for if the victory were not already gotten, we
ſhould not now trouble our ſelves as we doe. But take heed ſaid ſhe unto me, that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
be not on both ſides. I am more afraid, ſaid I, that the loſſe will be on both ſides.
Nay, nay, replyed ſhe, never think ſo, heaven loves you better then to uſe you ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but pray tell me, ſince the victory will fall on your ſide, what Ranſome muſt the
Conquered pay into you? His heart, ſaid I unto her. His heart? anſwered ſhe: but if
he part with his heart, what ſhall he have for himſelfe? and how can he afterwards love
you? In lieu of that I take from him, ſaid I unto her I will give him mine. Yours? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
ſhe and ſmiled? if he have your heart, he will be the verieſt cowardly Cavalier that
ever lived. Come come, ſaid I unto her, you are a ſcold, and ſtand and ſpend the
time in tattling whilſt he ſtayes. Upon this, we went to the window, and no ſooner
looked out, but I ſaw <hi>Arimant</hi> at a corner of a ſtreet over againſt us. He had his eye ſo
continually up in the window, as it was impoſſible to look one and he not ſee us; and
therefore the Caſement was no ſooner open, but he was under the window, expecting when
the Ladder would be thrown out. I began to tremble ſo, both for contentment and fear,
as I was conſtrained to fit down upon my bed, leaving <hi>Clarina</hi> to all the paines, who
with abundance of confidence, faſtned the Cord, and threw out the Ladder, by which
<hi>Arimant</hi> ſo ſuddenly mounted, that he was in my Chamber before I thought his foot
upon the firſt ſtep. As ſoon as he was entred, he fell down upon his knees before me,
whom he found in ſuch a maze, as I could not ſo much as ſpeak unto him. <hi>Clarina</hi> pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the Ladder, ſhut the window, and then came to ſee what we did; but finding the
Cavalier ſtill upon his knees, and I ſpeaking not a word to him, nor he to me; I to ſee a
man in my Chamber at ſuch an hour, and he with an extaſie of contentment to have this
aſſurance of my affection, ſhe ſaid unto me; Methinks, Miſtreſſe (for ſo ſhe called me)
you are not very civil towards this Cavalier, in letting him be ſo long in this uneaſie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture:
for God ſake, ſaid the Cavalier, let me alone where I am, for I am where I moſt
earn ſtly deſire to be, and think my ſelfe beyond all expreſſions, happy in it. Then recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
my ſelfe, I muſt needs confeſſe, ſaid I unto him, that <hi>Clarina</hi> is in the right, and
if my aſtoniſhment doe not plead my excuſe, you may very well tax me with incivility,
and indiſcretion. Upon this I ſtood up, and taking him by one arm, whilſt <hi>Clarina</hi> took
him by the other, we forced him to ſit in a Chaire which was by my beds ſide. Then
<hi>Clarina</hi> taking <hi>Arimant</hi> by the hand, Sweare Cavalier (ſaid ſhe unto him) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
me upon your honour, to obſerve the conditions, upon which you were admitted
into this place. Then <hi>Arimant</hi> ſtood up, and ſaid, I doe promiſe and ſweare, not onely
to performe all I have ſaid, but alſo not to faile in my very thoughts; I call God, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
Earth, and all the world, to witneſſe my Oath, and pray them all to inflict their
moſt ſevere puniſhments upon all perjured Perſons.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Oathes and imprecations, <hi>Arimant,</hi> ſaid I unto him, are needleſſe, your owne
word would have ſatisfied: As for my part, I have ſo great a confidence in you, as I daie

So you, Madam, reſembling them both in beauty and in virtue, you have done me a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
which does not onely infinitely tranſcend my merits, but alſo all the hopes that ever
I could imagine. Since it is ſo, and fince I muſt needs acknowledge it ſo; what ſhould I
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53527:74"/>
doe, not to acquit my ſelfe, for I cannot pretend unto it, knowing it to be impoſſible; but
onely to avoid the brand of ingratitude? I muſt confeſſe, the more I think upon it, the
more I am confounded and aſhamed, that my fortune ſhould he to receive ſuch high be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
and have ſo little underſtanding as not to know, how I ſhould be thankful as I
ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have no other way to come out of this Labyrinth, but this only refuge, which is
to referre my ſelfe wholly unto your will; that as at my requeſt you were pleaſed to doe
me this favours ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I may by your commandment do what I ought, to acknowledge
it. After this expreſſion, he was ſilent, in expectation of my anſwer, which was this:
<hi>Arimant,</hi> ſaid I unto him, that you ſhould acknowledge that what I have done for you,
to be ſomething that is great and extraordinary, is as full ſatisfaction as I can deſire; but
I cannot endure you ſhould eſteem your ſelfe at ſo low a value, as to thinke that you doe
not deſerve this favour; for in ſo doing, you doe not onely offend againſt truth, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that judgement which I had of you, when I thought you worthy of my amity.
Doe not thinke, <hi>Arimant,</hi> that I have done any thing at random, or without ſound de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.
When I firſt gave entertainment to your good will, I muſt confeſſe it was
without any deſign, and onely becauſe your addreſſe did invite me to it: But when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
my good will upon you, doe not thinke unleſſe you have an ill opinion of me,
that I did it without long and ſerious debate in my ſelfe: whether I ought to doe it or
no, and whether I ſhould be blamed for ſuch a choice. I conſidered your family, becauſe
I would not diſparage my own Anceſtors; and I found it ſo full of nobleneſſe, as I could
not chuſe but be contented with it, I looked upon the perſon, and I could take no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
againſt it, either in your body or mind: I have obſerved your behaviour, and
I could not find any thing which was not noble, and to be eſteented, all your actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
full of honour and virtue. Briefly, I have caſt my eyes upon your affection, and I
find that you doe really love me. Now, <hi>Arimant,</hi> can you think that he who is owner
of theſe qualities, does not deſerve any favour from the perſon whom he loves? Madam,
anſwered he, and kiſſed my hand, this favour which you are pleaſed to doe me now, is
greater (if it can be) then the firſt; and I ſee you will put me out of all hopes of ever
being able to pay ſo great a debt. I received all thoſe applaudes which you are pleaſed to
beſtow upon me, not than I am ſo vaine as to think them my due, but becauſe I deſire you
ſhould think them ſo, that they may ſo much the more oblige you to continue unto me
the honour of your favours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Arimant,</hi> replyed I, you know very well, and I alſo, that
what I ſay of you is true; and this may be a great teſtimony of your merit, that <hi>Cryſeide</hi>
loves you; for you muſt either think her without wit or knowledge, or elſe think your
ſelfe amiable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe ſhe loves you. But let us leave this diſcourſe, and tell me I entreat
you, whether the report be true that you are to marry? and whether, as I am told, you
intend it? At this queſtion <hi>Arimant</hi> bluſht, and though I ſpoke it ignorantly, yet ſo it
was, that his Father had made ſuch a motion to him not long before, and therefore he
anſwered me, 'Tis true indeed, Madam, ſuch a thing is talked of, but my Father ſhall
ſooner make me die, then ever conſent unto it, for I am reſolved never to marry any
but the fair <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> if ſhe will bleſſe me with ſo much happineſſe. I would not be any

a promiſe which we neither can nor ought to make ſo raſhly, but it deſerves to be more
ſeriouſly, thought upon. Why, Madam replyed he preſently, have you given me all there
ſignal favours and deny me this which I ask with ſo much reaſon? but you muſt reſolve
either to have me continually kneeling before you, or elſe grant my ſupplication. I could
not chuſe but ſmile when I heard his laſt words, for he uttered them with ſuch an action, as
ſhewed him to be in good earneſt, Yet, I ſaid unto him, Perhaps, <hi>Arimant,</hi> you may
quickly reperit, if I ſhould take you at your word. Oh God? Fair <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> (ſaid he do
not offend ſo extreamly againſt my affection, and your own beauty. And to put you out
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53527:74"/>
of all doubt, I call <hi>Hymen</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> to witneſſe, that I will never be husband unto any
but the fair <hi>Cryſeide:</hi> and upon this word, I perceived that he would have put a Ring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my finger, which cauſed me to draw away my hand, and riſe up; but he held me by
force, and ſaid unto me; Will you, Madam, make me perjur'd, and riſe from hence,
where I have vowed to ſtay eternally, unleſſe you accompliſh my requeſt? Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
replyed I preſently, is unjuſt, and your vow invalid ſince your firſt which you made
at your entrance is contrary to it. Why ſaid he unto me? You promiſed, anſwered I, and
bound it with an Oath, that you would move me unto nothing but what I was willing
unto; and ſince I am not willing you ſhould make this requeſt, you are obliged to preſs it no
further, and what vowes ſoever you have made ſince, which are contrary unto that firſt,
is of no force nor cannot bind. It is moſt impoſſible, ſaid he, (and then roſe up) to reſiſt
either your beauty, or your will: And I know, I ſhould receive but too great a load of
happineſſe, if this were added to the number of the reſt. <hi>Arimant,</hi> ſaid I then unto him,
doe but ſtill preſerve your affection unto me, and I will freely promiſe, that if I can make
thoſe who have the diſpoſition of me conſent unto it, I will marry you, and give my ſelf
entirely unto you. It is impoſſible I ſhould expreſſe how this young man was joyed when
he heard this; and I was as glad as he, though he made greater ſhew by words, and all
the thanks that could be invented. But yet, this was the cauſe of our ruine, for calling
<hi>Clarina</hi> to witneſſe what I promiſed, and ſo ſhe coming haſtily towards us, did draw
the Box from the noſe of her Mother, and ſo unluckily, as it fell off the bed, was broke,
and the liquid ointment ran about the floor.</p>
                     <p>It was a thing very ſtrange, for almoſt as ſoon as ever the Box was from under the noſe
of my Nurſe, ſhe awoke, but her head ſo dizzy with the ſmell, that ſhe knew not what
ſhe did, and was like one that was drunk. As ſoon as <hi>Arimant</hi> heard the Box fall upon
the floor, he doubted it, and ſaid unto me haſtily, riſe Madam, and ſtand before the old
woman, whilſt I get out at the window, for certainly ſhe is awake. Upon this, I ran to
the bed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he to the window, and <hi>Clarina</hi> to the Ladder; and I coming to her, I laid me
down upon her bed, began to embrace her, laid my hand upon her breaſt, and ſeeming as
if I thought her to be very fick; I bad her take good heart, told her, ſhe would be well
againe preſently; called for <hi>Clarina,</hi> and ſent her for ſome Vineger or water to throw in
her face, and make her come to her ſelfe againe: I did ſo deceive her by my talke,
and by rubbing one while her Pulſe, and another her Noſe, as I gave <hi>Arimant</hi> time to be
gone, and <hi>Clarina</hi> to hide the Ladder: Then ſeeming to be very buſie about her, we
threw water into her face, and did ſo daſh her, as ſhe had been ſoundly aſleep, had ſhe
not awaked with it. Then in a great aſtoniſhment, aſſuming her ſpirits: Oh my God,
ſaid ſhe, where have I been? how ſtrangely have I been taken, what in the name of God
is the cauſe of it? Oh my good Children, I thank God and you, for bringing me to my ſelf
again, for but for you I had dyed. Oh Mother, ſaid <hi>Clarina,</hi> you have been in a ſwoone
above two hours, we have held you in our Arms, and done all we could to revive you,
and I believe if you had not vomited, you had dyed. And good Children, ſaid the good
old woman, what did you doe to waken me? Why, ſaid <hi>Clarina,</hi> as I was lying by you,
I heard you keep a great ſtirring and a rattling in your throat as if you were choaked;
upon which, I called upon you two or three times, and ſeeing you did not anſwer, I lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of bed and waked <hi>Cryſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ide;</hi> then taking the Candle, we came both to help you, and
thanks be to God you came to your ſelfe againe. And did I vomit, ſaid the old woman?
Vomit? ſaid <hi>Clarina,</hi> Yes certainly, and happy you did, for if you had not, I believe you
had dyed, ſince ſuch black and filthy ſtuffe did lie upon your ſtomack. Oh God, ſaid ſhe,
and held her Noſe, doe you not ſwell it? This ſhe ſaid, becauſe of the ointment which
was ſpilt upon the floor, and ſmelt very ill: Yes, yes, (ſaid my Nurſe) I doe ſmell it;
Good <hi>Clarina,</hi> ſaid ſhe, take the beſome and make it cleane, leſt it ſhould doe you hurt,
<hi>Clarina,</hi> who deſired ſuch a command, did fetch ſome water, and waſhed the place as
clean as poſſible, and afterwards threw it out of the window. But the accident of the
next morning, may move one to laugh a little; for this ointment falling in the ſtreet,
and a Dogge paſſing by and ſmelling at the oyle, he licked it, and there lay as if dead.
<hi>Clarina,</hi> who ſaw this out of the window, and doubted the cauſe, ſhe threw a little
water upon him, then the Dog roſe up, ſhook his eares, and went away. The evening af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Arimant,</hi> according to his cuſtome, came with Muſick under the window, and after
they had played a while, he ſung ſome Verſes which intimated, that he would moſt invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olably
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53527:75"/>
keep his promiſe. And while we lived in this manner, both our affections encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſuch a height, as I cannot tell which was the more loved. But now fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to mix many bitters amongſt our ſweets, or rather to raviſh from us all our ſweets,
and leave us none but bitters. Alas, alas, well may I phraſe them <hi>Bitters:</hi> for ſince this
time, I cannot ſay I enjoyed any delight or contentment. <hi>Rithimer</hi> of whom I have already
ſpoke, a great Captain and a Favorite of the Emperour <hi>Majoranus</hi> had obtained, not
onely to be a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo to be a Senator and Governour of <hi>Gaul Ciſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,</hi>
and he attained unto ſuch high eſteem, as he diſpoſed abſolutely of all that was in
<hi>Gaul.</hi> This large Authority did not proceed onely from good will and favour of the
Emperours, but much from the great exploits which he had done againſt the <hi>Vandals,</hi> for
the preſervation of <hi>Italy.</hi> This valiant Prince, married one that was of kin to my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and deſiring to ſee me well matched, did caſt his eye upon a young man, a little
of kin unto <hi>Rithimer,</hi> very rich, but of a moſt vicious ſpirit, and the moſt ugly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
body that was in all <hi>Gaul Ciſalpine.</hi> My Mother who deſired to be rid of me,
becauſe ſhe thought me to be a rub in her way of marriage, ſhe took occaſion by the
foretop, and reſolved to carry me unto this Princeſs, hoping at the leaſt to leave me with
her as ſhe deſired.</p>
                     <p>This being reſolved upon, and unknown to me, it was almoſt as ſoon executed without
my knowledge. For beginning to obſerve how I did much favour the addreſſe of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi>
ſhe thought to prevent me, which doubtleſſe ſhe would not have done, had his
eſtate been equall to his merit and nobleneſſe. But ſince it was not, ſhe thought that ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me away, was the beſt remedy ſhe could uſe againſt it. Yet ſeeing her ſo bufie in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her houſe in order, and ſo carefull, that I ſhould dreſſe my ſelfe in my fineſt trim, I
did imagine that ſome voyage was intended. And becauſe I could not depart without
advertiſing <hi>Arimant,</hi> I commanded <hi>Clarina</hi> to let him know it, and give unto him the
Book which was accuſtomed to paſſe betwixt us, and in it was this Letter.</p>

                     <p>I received this Letter, as we were taking Coach to begin our journey; ſo as I could not
read it, becauſe I had not time to look it out, it being mingled amongſt many others in
the Book, which was no ſmall diſpleaſure unto me. <hi>Arimant</hi> on the other ſide, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I was to depart that day, met us upon the way, as if accidentally with two Cavaliers
his friends, whom he had not acquainted with his affection unto me; and who yet were
not altogether ignorant of it; and who upon this occaſion, being very familiar with my
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53527:75"/>
Mother; as ſoon as they met the Coach, they ſaluted us, and enquired of her voyage.
She who now did not care who knew it, did freely tell them, and began to talk of <hi>Rithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
Grandure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the power her Couſen had with him, and of the hopes ſhe had of
doing great matters for me. In the meane time, <hi>Arimant</hi> had got himſelfe on my ſide,
but in ſuch a ſad and afflicted poſture, as he moved me to pitty him: and was ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
out of himſelfe, as he began to rove, and talke very idlely; and yet to augment
our miſery, for feare of making known the good correſpondency betwixt us; he durſt
not addreſſe his ſpeech unto me, though his eyes were never off me; thoſe who heard him,
and did not know the cauſe which thus diſtracted his mind, they began to laugh at his
ridiculous language.</p>
                     <p>I who confidered that ſometimes to be over ſubtle ſpoiles all, I thought it expedient
to ſpeake unto him as a perſon indifferent; and therefore I asked him, from whence this
great ſorrow proceeded, which cauſed every one to take notice of it? I doe aſſure you,
ſaid he, and ſighed, it proceeds from nothing but envy. I did not thinke, anſwered I
that a perſon of your merit could envy any one; but of whom and why are you envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
I envy your Coach (ſaid he unto me) that is going towards the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>bices,</hi> and becauſe
I may not go with you, although it be my Country. Why, replyed I, are you ſuch a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of your Country, as you ſhould envy things that are inſenſible? What ſhould I doe,
ſaid he, ſince ſuch inſenſibles are more happy than I am? Heaven, I hope, ſaid I, is better
unto you than ſo. This is the conſolation, anſwered he, which is given unto thoſe who
are miſerable, yet I aſſure you any better ſhall never be deſired by me, but rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Thoſe who are ſicke, ſaid I, doe the like, they thinke all medicines bitter, and ſuch
Phyſicke is commonly given unto them, as is contrary to their deſires, though conducing
to their health. Great is the difference, ſaid he, betwixt the diſeaſes of the body, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
of the mind: For thoſe of the body are cured by contraries, but thoſe of the
mind, by the poſſeſſion of that thing which cauſes the diſeaſe. If ambition wound us
is there any better cure than to arrive at the thing aſpired unto? If beauty offend us,
will any thing ſo quickly ture, as the injoyment of that beauty? And therefore they
ſay, that deſires ſatisfied doe coole at the very firſt, afterwards are quite glutted; ſo as
to the maladies of the mind muſt be applyed ſuch remedies as have the qualitie of the
Scorpion, which can cure the wound it makes. It is long ſince you were in your owne
Country, ſaid <hi>Clarina;</hi> and what makes you thinke upon it ſo freſhly now? Your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
ſaid he, and ſighed, brings it freſh into my memory.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who heard our diſcourſe did not underſtand it, though if my Mother had not
been diverted by the queſtions of thoſe two Cavaliers, doubtleſſe ſhe would have ſmelt out
ſomething, but ſhe ſeeing us thus talking, ſhe would not ſuffer them to goe any farther
with us, although they told her their way did lye that way, but ſhe was ſo urgent with
them, that they were conſtrained to leave us. Now did I find, that to part from a perſon
loved might well be called a death, both by my owne reſentments, and by <hi>Arimants,</hi>
for he looked as pale as death it ſelfe, and was ſo out of himſelfe, that he could not bid
adieu unto me: or any in the company, which my Mother interpreted to be incivility,
and perhaps on purpoſe, though ſhe beleeved the contrary; as for me, I knew the cauſe
finding in my ſelfe the ſorrowes of this cruel ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>I cannot at this time tell you <hi>Hylas,</hi> how ſadly both <hi>Arimant</hi> and I reſented it; onely
this, that both fell ſicke, and <hi>Arimant</hi> much worſe than I; for mine was only a certaine
languiſhment, and drooping of ſpirits, which many feared would in a little time bring
me into a Conſumption: But his diſeaſe was ſo violent as none looked for any life; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

was at the height of his diſeaſe, and that the Phyſitians had good hopes of his recovery;
and alſo that the next day he was out of all danger. For my part, I flattered my ſelfe ſo
far as to beleeve, that the contentment which he found in my Letter was the cauſe of it;
but whether that was true or no, I know not, but it is certaine, that he perfectly recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which was ſo great a joy unto me, that I alſo began to mend of my malady, as if there
was ſome ſympathy in our Diſeaſes, both falling ſicke, and both recovering at one
time.</p>
                     <p>When I came to the houſe of <hi>Rithimer,</hi> and his wife ſaw me ſo much out of temper,
what through my long journey, and what through my ſorrows to be ſo far from him I
loved, ſhe thought it beſt to recover me before I was expoſed to the view, and not to
ſpeake of the marriage which ſhe intended till then, thinking that it was beauty which
would bring on <hi>Cloringus</hi> (for ſo he was called whom ſhe aimed for my Husband). My mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cheered me up as much as ſhe could, and told me that within few dayes I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
and to my miſery it hapned ſo as ſhe ſaid: For I was told that <hi>Arimant</hi> would
come and ſee me, either in diſguiſe, or ſome other way, in which he ſhould not be known.
This hope gave me health, and my face became as it was wont to be, ſo as I began to ſhew
my ſelfe; and indeed many began to caſt amorous eyes upon me, eſpecially <hi>Rithimer,</hi> as
ſince I underſtood, his wife at the ſame time ſolicited the match, propounded unto <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimer,</hi>

a ſelfe deſigne upon me, and knowing <hi>Clorangus</hi> to be a man of that deformity, he
did approve of it, thinking that the leſſe I loved my husband, the more it would make for
himſelfe; ſo as faigning all that he did was at his wifes inſtance and deſire, he ſent for
<hi>Clorangus,</hi> propounded it unto him, adviſed him to imbrace it, and at the ſame time
got his conſent. I know not whether that which they call beauty in me, or my misfortune
was the cauſe, but ſo it was, that the match was concluded upon, before a ſyllable was
ſpoke of it unto me. Obſerve how Heaven does mocke at all humane intentions; when I
fancied unto my ſelfe the fulleſt contentment, even then was I overwhelmed with the

not reliſh it at the firſt, but hoping alſo that my Pillow-cogitations would make me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
according to her deſires.</p>
                     <p>Oh Heavens, <hi>Hylas,</hi> in what a ſtrange dumpe was I ſtruck when I heard this, and yet
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53527:76"/>
it was ſome comfort that my Mother was gone, for I could cry with more liberty; I
threw my ſelfe upon my bed, and leaſt my complaints ſhould be heard I ſtopped my mouth
with the ſheet, but all would not hinder <hi>Clarina</hi> from hearing me, who being advertiſed
of it, came unto me, and would have given me ſome good counſell; but turning towards
her, I ſaid; Away, away, <hi>Clarina,</hi> I am tormented enough without any addition from
you; let me weepe away that little time I have to live, and lament that misfortune, which
cannot be lamented enough; ſhe who did moſt tenderly love me, and knew well enough
what it was I thus grieved at: I come not, ſaid ſhe, with any intentions of comforting
you, but onely to helpe you into bed to the end none may moleſt you. I had rather, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you would helpe me to my grave: Upon that I ſuffered her to undreſſe me,
and lay as ſtill as if I had been dead: For ſo deepe were my reſentments that I could not
cry; but when I was in bed, and the Light taken away, then teares began to flow in ſuch
abundance downe my cheekes and breſt, that my bed was all water: Sometimes my
thoughts were all upon <hi>Arimant,</hi> his merits, and all thoſe teſtimonies of his affection to
me; otherwhile I reflected upon <hi>Clorangus</hi> and his crabbed deformities, and finding ſuch
a vaſt difference between them, I was in ſuch an extream Labyrinth of griefe, that truly
the Gods were mercifull unto me, that I did not fall into a moſt violent deſpaire; all
Night long I did nothing but lament, and Day found me in bed without ever cloſing an
eye; and ſee what a violent affection may ſometimes doe. I was fully reſolved to dye,
knowing that my Mother would not be ſtirred at any prayers, ſo as ſtill thinking upon
<hi>Arimant,</hi> and his affection to me, I thought it better to dye once, than be dying every
hour as long as I lived.</p>
                     <p>The next morning when I ſaw <hi>Clarina</hi> and moſt of the houſe were gone to the Temple
according to cuſtome leaving none to looke unto me but a young Boy, who ſerved me,
I deſired him to goe preſently and fetch a Chyrurgion, without telling any one. When
he came, Sir, ſaid, I am much troubled with a paine in my head; and I deſire you to
let me blood in my left arme, for I have uſed to doe ſo when the paine tooke me, finding
alwayes preſent eaſe by it. He ſeeing me looke red, and my eyes heavy, verily beleeved
me, ſo as he bound my arme, opened my veine, and went away; he was no ſooner out
of the houſe, but I called the little Officer, and deſired him to fetch another, for this laſt
had done me no good; the Boy made haſte, and brought another, I told him the ſame
tale I told before; I opened my other arme, keeping the other cloſe, he did as I deſired,
and went away.</p>
                     <p>Thinking that this was enough to end my miſerable dayes, I cauſed the Curtaines to
to be drawne, and the windowes ſhut, as if the light offended me; then thinking how ſad
the Newes of my death would be unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> but withall thinking it would be a
great comfort unto him to hear I dyed loving him, I tooke my Hankercher and ſpreading
it upon the bed, I dipt my finger in my blood, and writ in it theſe words, <hi>Arimant I dye
thine,</hi> which was all I was able to doe, for preſently my eyes began to faile me, and my
heart fainted, ſo as I loſt my knowledge, yet I doe remember, that my laſt thought being
of <hi>Arimant,</hi> I ſaid aloud, <hi>Now Fortune the Victory is mine:</hi> After this, I remained
as dead, and certainly had been ſo if <hi>Clarina</hi> had not come into the Chamber, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that all my griefe proceeded from my loſſe of <hi>Arimant,</hi> ſhe came to bring me a Letter
from him, brought by him who uſed to bring them before; but when ſhe drew the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and found me ſwimming in blood: Oh God (cryed ſhe out ſo loud as was heard
into my Mothers Chamber) Oh God, ſhe is dead, <hi>Chryſeide</hi> is dead, and wringing her
hands together, ſhe ran out of the room all in tears, not knowing what ſhe did. The
windowes were immediately opened, and every one ran unto me; they ſaw I was all in
blood, but not imagining it came from my arme, they were long in ſearching for the
wound. <hi>Clarina</hi> in the mean time laying her hand upon my Hankercher, and opening it
ſhe ſaw what I had writ with my finger; and though it was ſo ill written as ſhe could
hardly read it, yet ſhe put it in her pocket leaſt any elſe ſhould ſee it, and running out of
the Chamber to my Mother told her of the accident: By fortune, as ſhe went, ſhe met
him that brought the Letter from <hi>Arimant,</hi> who asked her for an anſwer, becauſe his
Maſter had commanded him to returne as ſoon as he could, to whom ſhe anſwered all in
tears, it is a ſad anſwer which you muſt carry to your Maſter at this time, <hi>Chryſeide</hi> is
dead, becauſe they would have forced her to marry <hi>Clorangus.</hi> Carry him this Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
there will he find writ with the hand and blood of <hi>Chryſeide</hi> the cauſe of her death:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53527:77"/>
Upon this, ſhe went all teares to tell my Mother, who was then with the wife of <hi>Rithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi>
when they heard this ſaid newes, they were extreamly aſtoniſhed. But the Prince,
like one that was tranſported, ran preſently to the place where I was, and ſeeing me ſo
in blood, by chance he took me by the arme to lift me up, and finding my ſleeve full of
blood ſhe has cut her veines (ſaid he); and then turning up the ſleeve of my ſmock,
he found that the bloud did not run, becauſe my ſleeve ſtuck to the wound (and I believe
that ſaved my life) for as ſoon us it was pulled away, he ſaw it began to bleed afreſh;
he put his finger upon it, and bad <hi>Clarina</hi> doe the like to the other arm, for he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the other ſleeve bloody alſo; then cauſing ſome cold water to be brought; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
(ſaid he) ſhe is not yet dead, for I find ſhe is hot: Then throwing ſome of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my face, and rubbing my Temples and pulſe with ſome imperiall waters, and ſuch
like, my Pulſe began to returne, and I began to breathe. Then ſending in all poſt haſte
for Phyſitians, and they coming before it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

recover'd my knowledge. <hi>Rithimer</hi> never ſtirring from me all the while, till he ſaw me
out of all danger: Afterwards he told me, that he never ſaw me ſo faire as then; for the
loſs of blood making me look pale and white, and that whiteneſs being as it were paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with blood, one ſeemed to adde beauty to the other. Moreover, his pitty of me did
augment his love, and his love was covered under the vail of compaſſion.</p>
                     <p>But when I was a little better ſettled, his wife and my Mother, asked me, what, and
who it was that had brought me into that condition? but I knowing that they were
the cauſes of all my miſery, to avoid their importunity, ſeemed not to heare them, and
would not ſpeak. And one of the Phyſitians told them, that it was better not to trouble
me, for ſpeaking might doe me harme; but it was requiſite I ſhould take ſomething, and
be left unto my reſt, which accordingly they did; and in the meane time <hi>Rithimer</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of the boy who waited upon me, whether he perceived what I did unto my ſelfe.
The boy fearing a beating if he confeſſed, anſwered; No, and that onely I commanded
him to ſhut the windows, and draw the Curtaines. This cauſed <hi>Rithimer</hi> to call for <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina:</hi>
Doe not leave <hi>Cryſedd,</hi> (ſaid he) for if you doe, ſhe will make her ſelfe bleed
againe and die, therefore be very carefull of her. Sir, ſaid ſhe unto him, you may if you
will ſave her life, which certainly ſhe will now, or ſome other time loſe, unleſſe you doe
remedy it. I doe vow and ſweare (ſaid he) by the life of <hi>Anthemius,</hi> that I will do all
I can to ſave it: <hi>Clarina</hi> thinking ſhe had found a fit opportunity. Sir, ſaid ſhe, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you in the firſt place, not to diſcover me; and next, be aſſured that <hi>Clorangus</hi> is the
cauſe of her death, and ſhe will rather chuſe a Grave then him. Thinke you ſo? ſaid
<hi>Rithimer.</hi> More then think. Sir, ſaid ſhe, for I am ſure, and if you will know the truth,
obſerve what alteration will be in her face, when I tell her of it in her ear. Then both
going to the bed and cauſing all others to retire from us, ſhe ſaid unto me in a low voice;
Be of good courage <hi>Cryſeide, Rithimer</hi> ſweares by the life of <hi>Anthemius,</hi> that you ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

never marry <hi>Clorangus.</hi> I was ſo weake, as I could not move any thing except my eyes:
but this newes was ſo welcome unto me, as lifting them up towards heaven, I ſeemed to
give hearty thankes for ſo great a favour: Afterwards, turning towards <hi>Rithimer,</hi> I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
my ſelfe to ſpeake. Sir, ſaid I unto him, is it true. Yes ſweet heart (ſaid he unto me)
and I ſweare it, not onely by <hi>Anthemius,</hi> but alſo by the head of my Father, and all
that is holy. Then replyed I, I will live. Live then, anſwered he, and be aſſured I will
ſooner conſent unto my own death, than break my promiſe of it. Upon this I changed
countenance, and moſt miraculouſly aſſumed vigour. <hi>Rithimer</hi> admired this reſolution
in me, and calling his Wife and my Mother: I tharge you, ſaid he unto them, that there
be no more talk of marriage between <hi>Cryſeide</hi> and <hi>Clorangus;</hi> for I vow and proteſt, I
will ſooner conſent unto the loſſe of all my fortunes; then unto a match ſo unſutable.
They offered to reply, but he interrupted them by ſaying, I have ſworn it by the life of
<hi>Athemius,</hi> by the head of my Father, and by all thats holy. Not a word more of it;
and whoſoever ſhall doe otherwiſe, ſhall find my diſpleaſure. Upon this, both of them
went away, and ſpoke not a word, <hi>Rithimer</hi> highly eſteeming my generous reſolution,
his good will unto me did ſo augment, as from thence forward it may well be ſaid, be
was in love with me. He went away, and viſited me a hundred times in a day, and moſt
commonly by himſelfe. And becauſe he durſt not ſpeak unto me, leſt it ſhould be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
unto me, he talked with <hi>Clarina,</hi> would ſometimes aske her how ſhe came to
know that the marriage with <hi>Clorangus</hi> made me take that reſolution; other whiles he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53527:77"/>
would thanke her for acquainting him with it, and did ſo manifeſtly make the greatneſſe
of his affection appear, as his wife perceived it, and <hi>Clarina</hi> alſo. As for me, I took all
his actions as proceeding from that compaſſion which ſuch an accident cauſed in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

with him; for I was ſo weakned as I did nothing elſe, but ſleep and reſt my ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>I reſted thus two or three dayes, and never remembred my Hankercher wherein I had
written with my blood; but one morning when I found my ſelfe a little better, it came

ſhe asked me whether I felt any new pain. My paine, anſwered I faintly, is in my minde:
But, good <hi>Clarina,</hi> were you the firſt that found me in that condition, into which I had
brought my ſelfe? Who doe you thinke, ſaid ſhe, has the greateſt care of you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

very well, ſaid I, that it is <hi>Clarina;</hi> but if you were the firſt, did you not ſee a Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
which was ſpotred with my blood? Yes, anſwered ſhe, I did ſee it; and alas now
you put me in mind, I have committed a great fault, which I muſt preſently remedy For
Miſtreſſe, that unhappy morning, <hi>Arimant</hi> had written unto you, and I came with all
joy to bring the Letter, when I found you in that ſad condition, I ran through the houſe
like a fool, crying and tormenting my ſelfe; and being thus out of my ſelfe, I met the
meſſenger which <hi>Arimant</hi> ſent with the Letter, who not knowing of the accident which
had hapned unto you, he was urgent with me for an anſwer: I told him you were dead,
and gave him the Hankercher whereof you ſpeak, to carry unto his Maſter in teſtimony
of your affection to him. How? ſaid I, Has <hi>Arimant</hi> the Hankercher? Doubtleſſe he
has, anſwered ſhe, for it is three dayes ſince I ſent it to him. Oh God cryed I, I feare it
will ruine him; what will become of him, <hi>Clarina,</hi> when he ſees that aſſurance of my
death? Upon this, ſhe ſtood mute a while, and at laſt anſwered, 'Tis true, Miſtreſs,
ſaid ſhe, that if the meſſenger did depart without any further enquiry of the particulars
of your death, it might perplex <hi>Arimant.</hi> Of whom, replyed I, could he enquire but
your ſelfe? Indeed <hi>Clarina,</hi> you were much to blame: and if when you ſaw me paſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
you did not advertiſe him of it, your ſecond fault was worſe then your firſt. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
ſaid ſhe, I beſeech you pardon me: my griefe was ſo great, as when I ſaw you
dead, I was reſolved to follow you; and I muſt confeſſe, that I ſent the Hankercher unto
<hi>Arimant,</hi> purpoſely to invite him unto the ſame. But ſince that danger was over, I have
been ſo buſie about you, as I have hardly remembred to eate my meat. Go, ſaid I unto
her, and write unto him preſently from me; if I can, I will adde a word with my owne
hand, <hi>Clarina</hi> upon this, ſhut the door left any ſhould ſurpriſe her, and taking Pen, Ink,

to be falſe; Another was, becauſe I found that he did really love me; and laſtly, becauſe
I hoped ere long to ſee him, and to communicate unto him a deſigne which I had in hand.
But in the mean time, his meſſenger made ſuch haſte, that travelling both night and day,
he found him in bed, intending to depart that day: And the meſſenger coming unto

ſhe has ſhewed me the way, and I am ready to follow it; I grieve at nothing more than
that I did not goe before, at leaſt keepe her company. Then turning himſelfe towards
the young man; but Friend (ſaid he unto him) you have not yet told me how this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

preſently, nothing can either augment or leſſen my griefe, therefore tell me all. I
ſhall then tell you Sir, ſaid the young man; That I came thither betimes in the morning,
and according to your inſtructions, I watched when <hi>Clarina</hi> went to the Temple, where
I found her and conveyed the Letter ſo cloſely into her hand that none perceived me, and
deſiring her to diſpatch me with an anſwer as ſoone as ſhe could, ſhe told me, that to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow
morning I ſhould have it. Preſently after, I went into the houſe of <hi>Rithimer</hi> where
ſhe lodged, and I was no ſooner entred, but I heard a great biſling on every ſide, and
<hi>Chryſeide, Chryſeide,</hi> continually named. I went up the ſtairs, and found <hi>Clarina</hi> all in
tears and great diſorder, who as ſoon as ſhe ſaw me; It is but a ſad anſwer (ſaid ſhe) that
you muſt carry your Maſter at this time; alas <hi>Chryſeide</hi> is dead, and onely becauſe they
would needs force her to marry <hi>Clorangus,</hi> carry him this Hankercher, wherein he will
find written with the hand and blood of <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> cauſe enough to love her memory. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this ſhe cryed, and went into another Chamber. Oh Heavens! cryed out <hi>Arimant,</hi>
can I live, and heare this? But go on, I intreat you. You may imagine Sir, ſaid the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
that this did much amaze me, and to know the more certainty of the matter, I
ſtayed a little longer, and ſaw three or foure perſons come out of <hi>Chryſeides</hi> Chamber all
in tears, holding up their hands, and ſaying, that truly ſhe dyed very ſtrangely. This
inſpired me with more curioſity and boldneſſe to enter into the room, ſeeing all the houſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53527:78"/>
did the like. There, Sir, I ſaw her; Oh diſmall ſight! I ſaw her dead on her bed, and it
ſo full of blood, that it ran downe upon the ground. At this time <hi>Rithimer</hi> and many
women entred; and I heard <hi>Rithimer</hi> cry out and ſay, ſhe had cut her veines. I was
then afraid leaſt any ſhould know me, and becauſe you had expreſly forbidden that, and
thinking I could hear no more, I came preſently out of the Towne, and made all haſte
that poſſibly I could, becauſe you had ſo commanded, though with much ſorrow to be
the meſſenger of ſuch ſad Newes. Alas, alas, (cryed he) I ſee it is but too true that <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeide</hi>
is dead, ſince you have ſeen her ſo with your owne eyes; could the Gods ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto ſuch a cruelty, and can I heare this Newes and ſtill live? He would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
on, when his Father hearing of his being ill, and who loved him moſt tenderly,
being his onely Son, came and knocked at the Chamber door. The young man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his voice, he advertiſed <hi>Arimant,</hi> who ſetting as good a face upon it as he could,
bad him open the door. The windows were yet ſhat, and the curtaines drawne, ſo as when
his father came into the Chamber, he could not well ſee the ſadneſſe in <hi>Arimants</hi> face;
but coming to him, and taking his hand, he asked him how he did? Well Sir, anſwered
he, but only for a little faintneſſe which proceeds from repletion of humours, for want of
exerciſe, but if you thinke it good, I deſire to ride abroad and take ſome journey, as
well to diſſipate thoſe humours, as for change of Aire. I like it very well, ſaid the Father;
but whither would you goe? My greateſt fancy, anſwered <hi>Arimant,</hi> is to the <hi>Libicens,</hi>
as well becauſe it is the place of my birth, and naturall aire, as to ſee my kindred and
friends. I ſhould like it very well, ſaid the Father but that I feare the hatred of <hi>Rithimer.</hi>
Sir, replied <hi>Arimant,</hi> never fear it; I muſt confeſſe, that for you to goe would be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
but not for me, for there will not any advantage acrue unto <hi>Rithim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were dead; beſides, being there amongſt ſo many kindred and friends, he could not have
any intention againſt me, but it would be told me and eaſily prevented. The Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
what he ſaid, was eaſily brought to his opinion, which was not a little happineſſe
unto us all, eſpecially unto <hi>Arimant:</hi> For having before reſolved to kill himſelfe, he now
deferred the execution of what he intended unto the end of this voyage. He accoutred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
therefore as well as he could, and the next morning ſet forward, taking none with
him but this man, and another to walte upon him in his Chamber, telling his Father it
was more ſafe to goe with a ſmall Traine, than if better attended, becauſe leſſe notice
would be taken of him. His deſigne of going to the <hi>Libicens,</hi> was to meet with <hi>Clorangus,</hi>
and when he had diſpatched him, then to go unto the place where I was interred, there to
ſacrifice himſelfe unto my aſhes. And truly it was happy that this revenge was thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
for it retarded his intention of killing himſelfe, and the meſſenger whom I ſent
had more leaſure to carry him our Letters.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day he departed from his Father, halfe of it was gone before <hi>Arimant</hi> thought
either upon eating or reſting himſelfe; and the meſſenger whom I ſent met him at a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
over a River which is called <hi>Teſin,</hi> and not knowing him, paſſed on, as well becauſe
he did not thinke of finding him in any place but <hi>Eporedes,</hi> as becauſe his grief had much
changed his face, and was but ſlenderly attended, ſo as he never ſo much as dreamed of
<hi>Arimant.</hi> And <hi>Arimant</hi> he rid on ſo penſive, and his eyes ſo fixed to the ground, as he
did not ſo much as ſee him when he paſſed by: But as good lucke was, the meſſenger who
came unto me from him, was not heedleſſe, for he ſeeing the meſſenger who came from
me, acquainted his Maſter, telling him that if he would he might heare all the ſtory of
<hi>Cryſeide,</hi> for yonder was the man who once brought Letters from her. What can I hear,
anſwered <hi>Arimant,</hi> more than I have? Is it not too much that I have heard ſhe is dead?
ſo never ſo much as turning his eye towards him, he rid on; but the young man being
deſirous to know how I was interred, and all other paſſages, he went unto the meſſenger
whom I had ſent, and taking acquaintance, asked him of <hi>Clarina,</hi> and how ſhe took the
death of <hi>Cryſeide? Cryſeide,</hi> ſaid he, why, ſhe is alive, and thanks be to God very well.

                     <p>Upon this, the young man putting ſpurs to his Horſe, cryed out to his Maſter, Stay,
ſtay, Sir, ſtay, and I will tell you good newes: <hi>Arimant</hi> hearing his voyce, though not
underſtanding what he ſaid, and ſeeing him clap his hands as an action of joy, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53527:79"/>
at it: and when he was come a little nearer, What is the matter, ſaid he; and
what would you have with me? Sir, ſaid the young man, Good newes, <hi>Cryſeide</hi> is not
dead but alive, and has ſent this Meſſenger to you. <hi>Cryſeide</hi> alive? ſaid he and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
is it poſſible? Sir, ſaid the Meſſenger whom I ſent, it is certaine, and I am a
Meſſenger from her; upon this, <hi>Arimant</hi> lifted up his eyes and hands to heaven. Oh ye
good Gods, continued he, be ye for ever bleſſed, for this favour you have done me. Sir
ſaid my Meſſenger, <hi>Clarina</hi> commanded me to give you this Letter; <hi>Arimant</hi> was ſo
much out of himſelfe, as he took it with a trembling hand, and knew not what he did.
But at laſt, recollecting himſelfe, he asked him how I did. Sir, ſaid ſhe, ſhe is very well,
and in good health, <hi>Clarina</hi> commanded me to tell you as much. They told me, replyed
<hi>Arimant,</hi> that <hi>Cryſeide</hi> was dead: upon this, opening <hi>Clarina's</hi> Letter, though he
would have diſſembled it, yet his countenance betrayed his joyes, eſpecially when he ſaw
my Poſtſcript, without which, he ſhould have thought that <hi>Clarina</hi> deluded him; but
ſeeing my hand, and knowing it, he aſſured himſelfe I was alive, although he imagined
I was very weake. But tell me, my friend, ſaid he, Was it true that <hi>Cryſeide</hi> was in ſuch
a condition as I heard? Sir, anſwered the Meſſenger, ſhe could not be well worſe report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then ſhe was; for it night well be ſaid ſhe was dead, and afterwards returned to life:
Then he related unto him how I had been, how I was, and what they had done unto me.
I muſt confeſſe, (ſaid <hi>Arimant</hi> then) that <hi>Cryſeide</hi> tranſcends all Ladies in
beauty, and all Cavaliers in grandure of courage: but fearing leſt he ſhould ſay too
much, he held his peace, and riding on repaſte I himſelfe at the next Town, where he did
nothing but repeat unto himſelfe all that had paſſed.</p>
                     <p>New Accidents cauſing new Counſells <hi>Arimant</hi> ſtaying in this place all the reſt of
the day; all the night took up his thoughts in contriving meanes how to ſee me. And not
being able to reſolve upon it alone, he called for the young man whom he was wont to
ſend unto me, and who beſides his love to his Maſter, wanted neither wit nor judgement.
Unto him he did communicate his deſire of ſeeing me, and that he ſhould never enjoy
himſelfe till then: And yet he told him, that <hi>Rithimer</hi> did ſo extreamly hare his Father,
as he could not with any ſafety come where I was, much leſſe into my Chamber. The
young man after he had a little conſidered upon it: Sir, ſaid he, you muſt make a Virtue of
Neceſſity: firſt ſend away this Meſſenger, that he may not diſcover your deſignes: Next,
diſguiſe your ſelfe in the habite of a Merchant; ſo may you ſafely enter the Towne, and
remaine there a while unknown; and being there ſuch opportunities may happily
preſent themſelves, as you cannot here imagine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arimant</hi> liking the opinion of the man, as ſoon as it was day, he diſpatched my Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
away, who the next day brought me Letters from him, told us where he met him,
and by what chance he knew him; I will not now, <hi>Hylas,</hi> tell you what his anſwer was,
but you may imagine it full of thankes and extream contenment; and in the concluſion
of it, aſſured me, that he would ſee me ere long what fortune ſoever he ran; in the interim,
he loſt no time. For thinking it no diſcretion to come into the place where I was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a diſguiſe, he cauſed there ſuits to be made in the mode of Merchants, with all poſſible
haſte; and going into a wood, they ſhifted themſelves, and put their owne clothes in a
Portmantle. Thus clad, and diſguiſed as well as they could, they came into the Towne
where I was, and lodged in an Inne near the Gate. As for <hi>Arimant,</hi> he kept his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
all the reſt of the day, but he ſent his Valets abroad to heare newes: he commanded
him whom he was wont to ſend unto me, to enquire how I did, and to ſee <hi>Clarina</hi> if it
were poſſible. At night both of them returned to him, and told him what they heard;
and he whom he imployed unto my lodging, told him that he had ſeen <hi>Clarina,</hi> and ſpoke
with her, none perceiving him; that ſhe carried him to her Miſtreſſe, who was ſo weake
through loſſe of blood, as ſhe ſtill kept her bed, and ſwore unto him, he never ſaw her
ſo faire in all his life: That by fortune none being in the room, he talked to me along
while, and to tell me how he was diguiſed for feare of <hi>Rithimer,</hi> or ſome of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

conſidering the old enmity he had to his Father; that <hi>Clarina</hi> and I laughed he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

heare he was in that habite: And that I told him; ſince he was ſo diſguiſed, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

ſome good Laces, and extraordinary Ribands, and ſuch knacks, and pretend that he
would ſell them; that if he found any in my Chamber, to excuſe it, and ſay he would
come againe when I was more at leiſure; but if I was alone with <hi>Clarina,</hi> at it hapned
very often, he might enter, and ſpeak to me with all freedome and confidence <hi>Arimant</hi>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:53527:79"/>

into queſt of ſuch Merchandize as was requiſite for him As for his man, the newes he
brought, was the feares of the Townſmen, of a certaine ſtrange King, who they ſaid,
came into <hi>Gaul</hi> to plunder the Country as he had done divers times heretofore; then
falling into particulars, he ſaid, the Townſmen murmured, becauſe whilſt this King was
Pillaging and Ravaging all the Country, and carrying away both men women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
Priſoners. <hi>Rithimer</hi> was making love to a young Lady called <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> and did not
only neglect the people over whom he governed, but loſt that reputation which formerly
he had gotten by ſo many martial exploits.</p>
                     <p>This laſt part touched <hi>Arimant</hi> to the quick, yet being ſo near me and hoping ere long
to ſee me, he waved the thoughts of it; but giving his mind wholly to provide ſuch
Merchandize as would admit him to my Chamber, he loaded both himſelfe and his
man with the fineſt Laces and Ribands he could poſſibly procure, and pretended to come
from <hi>Gaul,</hi> from whence ſuch things commonly come: beſides, having that language,
he might the better be taken for a Merchant of <hi>Gaule.</hi> He ſpent all the next day in
triming up his equipage of Merchandize; and having very well furniſhed his Packes,
he came to the houſe of <hi>Rithimer,</hi> and paſſed for a Pedler. The young man who had
been already there, conducted him to my lodging: Thoſe who ſaw him go up with
his Packs, never queſtioned whither he went; for taking them for Pedlers, and many
uſing to come thither, they thought it not ſtrange to ſee them there. They ſtayed with
their Packs in the Anti-chamber, where the little boy which waited on me, paſſing by
chance, did ſee them; and coming into my Chamber, told <hi>Clarina,</hi> that there was Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in the Anti-chamber, who asked if any would buy any Laces or Ribands. <hi>Clarina</hi>
did preſently apprehend it to be <hi>Arimant,</hi> and coming unto me: We will ſee, Madam,
ſaid he, whether or no they be our Merchants; Go and ſee, ſaid I unto her, and if it be
they let them enter, for we are at leiſure to ſee what Wares they have, ſince none is in
the Chamber. <hi>Clarina</hi> went preſently; and becauſe the little boy followed her, ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as if ſhe knew him not, but asked what Wares they had? very fine Laces, Madam,
anſwered <hi>Arimant,</hi> in the language of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and very cheap. You come in very good
time, ſaid ſhe, for my Lady is alone, and will be glad to ſee what Laces you have; and
upon this ſhe conducted them to me.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſſe, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that I was ſtrangely tranſported, and he alſo when I ſaw him
come into my Chamber, and none but we three in it: For <hi>Clarina</hi> had ſent the little
officer into the Town of an errant. At the firſt when he entred, I held out my armes, and
he kneeling down by my beds ſide, I held him a long time cloſe to my breſt, ſo ſurpriſed
with joy, that I could not unlooſe my armes. My deareſt friend, ſaid I unto him, here
is thy <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> whom the Gods have retuſed, becauſe they would not be ſo unjuſt as to
rob thee of her. I doe acknowledge, Madam, ſaid he, that they are Gods, ſince they
are juſt But, Madam, ſaid he, what doe you meane, when you ſay my <hi>Cryſeide? Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi>
replyed I, be aſſured, that if <hi>Cryſeide</hi> be not yours, he is no bodies. I writ it in my
blood, and if you would have a greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Teſtimony, you ſhall have all I can give, and
that honour will permit me: For I thinke it reaſonable that ſince I expoſed my life
to preſerve my ſelfe yours, I ſhould reſerve nothing but render my ſelfe wholly unto your
diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>He would have anſwered, when <hi>Clarina</hi> took him off, becauſe ſhe heard ſome walking
in the Anti-chamber. Retiring therefore with all haſte, he went to his Companion,
who was begun already to lay open his Merchandize, and to ſhew them unto <hi>Clarina,</hi>
who ſeemed to be very buſie in looking upon ſeverall Laces, when <hi>Rithimer</hi> came into the
Chamber. He uſed to come unto me very often; as if the report which went about the
Town, of his love to me, were not falſe: ſoever ſince the accident which hapned unto
me, his affection to me was increaſed to ſuch a flame, as his Wife perceived it; ſhe being
naturally jealous; and unwilling any ſhould ſhare with her in that which ſhe ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
alone ſhe began to hate me extreamly, and was reſolved to remove me from <hi>Rithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
as ſoon as I was able to go abroad: And ſeeing my Mother extreamly angry with
me for refuſing <hi>Clorangus,</hi> ſhe told her of it. As for the was, <hi>Clarina</hi> heard their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
unknown to them, and told it unto me.</p>
                     <p>This remove which was intended did not trouble me at all; but on the contrary I was
rather glad of it, hoping it would be a meanes of my returne unto <hi>Eporedes,</hi> but I was
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53527:80"/>
much perplexed at the cruelty of my Mother, who ſwore and vowed that as ſoon as I
was out of <hi>Rithimers</hi> reach, ſhe would, whether I would or no, make me marry <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This reſolution of my Mother moved me unto another, which otherwiſe perhaps I
ſhould not; it was to give my ſelfe wholly unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> and avoid that tyranny which
ſhe threatned againſt me.</p>
                     <p>But to returne unto <hi>Rithimer;</hi> ſeeing him enter into my Chamber, I deſired <hi>Clarina</hi>
to tell the Pedlers that they ſhould go away now, and come againe in the morning, and
that then I would buy their Laces. This I did purpoſely, becauſe if <hi>Rithimer</hi> ſaw him
againe, he ſhould not think it ſtrange. <hi>Arimant</hi> knowing how reports went, concerning
this Princes love unto me, ſeeing him very amiable, and conſidering what favour his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
might procure him, he looked upon him with an eye not like a Pedlers, and vexed
he was to quit his place unto him; yet ſeeing there was no remedy, he put up his ware,
made a low leg, and went away; and I ſeeing him going, ſaid unto him; Farewell good
Friend, be ſure you come again to morrow.</p>
                     <p>This was the firſt interview, but to ſhorten my diſcourſe; Know, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that the next
day he came againe, when all was gone to the Temple, and when none was in the room
but <hi>Clarina</hi> and my ſelfe. But to loſe no time, ſeeing my Mother was reſolved as ſoon as
I was well, to marry me by force unto <hi>Clorangus,</hi> we thought it expedient to be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
and that in the habit of a man <hi>Arimant</hi> ſhould ſteale me away, and carry me
where he thought fit, upon a promiſe to marry me at the firſt place where it could conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
be done, and that in the mean time we ſhould live as Brother and Siſter. This
being the reſolution, <hi>Arimant</hi> provided clothes, as well for <hi>Clarina,</hi> as for me; he
brought them unto us, and promiſed without faile to be in the houſe where he lodged,
the fifth day after, which he ſhewed unto <hi>Clarina,</hi> that ſhe might conduct me thither. See
<hi>Hylas,</hi> unto what the ſeverity of Parents may drive their Children, and ſee what came
on't: The five dayes being expired, and making no queſtion but <hi>Arimant</hi> was at his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
according to appointment; I trimmed my ſelfe up like a man, and <hi>Clarina</hi> alſo, and
diſguiſed our ſelves ſo well, as meeting my mother when ſhe came from the Temple, ſhe
knew us not; but I was much amazed when I came to <hi>Arimants</hi> lodging, and found no
<hi>Arimant</hi> there, and much more when night came upon us, and could heare no newes of
him: Then did I begin to repent of my raſh act, and being ſo haſty as to ſtirre out of the
houſe till firſt I knew he was in his lodging: But the greateſt trouble was the report ſpred
abroad all over the Towne that I was loſt, and could not any where be heard of; that I
was ſearched for all over; This made me tell <hi>Clarina,</hi> that come what fortune would, we
muſt ſome way or other get out of the Town, and that ſince <hi>Arimant</hi> was not there, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ſome great miſchance had hapned unto him: When we were thus conſulting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
perplexed and knew not which way to turne our ſelves, I ſaw the young man who
waited upon <hi>Arimant</hi> enter into the Chamber; imagine <hi>Hylas,</hi> how great our content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was when we ſaw him: Oh my good friend, ſaid I unto him, where is thy Maſter?
He is in his owne houſe, ſaid he unto me, but ſo wounded as he cannot come unto you.
Who wounded him? (replied I, and trembled every joynt): One, anſwered he, whom he
has kild, and to be ſhort, you muſt know that my Maſter not being ignorant of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
which <hi>Clorangus</hi> had upon you, he challenged him, they fought, and he killed him;
but yet he came not off without two great wounds, which though not dangerous, yet
are ſo troubleſome that he can neither ride nor go, the one is in his thigh, and the other
in his leg. Now ſeeing he could not come hither as he promiſed, he ſent me to wait upon
you, and conduct you where he is, having furniſhed me with horſes and all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.
Friend, ſaid I unto him, I knew ſome great occaſion hindred thy Maſter from being
here, I am glad both he and I are rid of the trouble of <hi>Clorangus,</hi> but I wiſh it had not
coſt him ſo deare; when thou wilt, we will be going that we may the ſooner be with thy
Maſter, and ſee his wounds dreſſed: Truly, ſaid he, I thinke there is no better ſalve than
your ſelfe; then calling <hi>Clarina</hi> we conſulted what we ſhould doe to eſcape, it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
ſtrict guards would be at the Gates: and after a long debate we concluded that the
young man ſhould goe unto the Pallace of <hi>Rithimer</hi> to heare what people ſaid, and to
learne if it was poſſible, in what manner they ſearched for me, and that in the mean time
we ſhould cut our haire, to the end that if they did ſearch for us, they might not ſo ſoon
know us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:53527:80"/>
This being reſolved upon, the young man went accordingly, and was ſo nimble and
ſubtle, as he mingled himſelfe amongſt the Domeſtiques of <hi>Rithimer,</hi> where he heard all
their diſcourſe to be of nothing but upon me; ſome ſaid I was fled, and had good reaſon
for it, becauſe they would needs force me to marry <hi>Clorangus,</hi> the uglieſt fellow amongſt
all the <hi>Ciſalpine Gaules;</hi> others who thought themſelves more wiſe, murmured againſt
the wife of <hi>Rithimer,</hi> ſaying ſhe had packt me away, being jealous of her husband and
me, and this opinion went ſo far that <hi>Rithimer</hi> beleeved it, remembring ſhe had ſerved
him ſuch a tricke before, and this was the reaſon that when my Mother fell downe upon
her knees and beſeeched him that a ſtrict ſearch might be made for me, he anſwered her
with an angry ſmile: Go, go, Madam, if you doe not know where you daughter is,
aske your Cozen, and without further anſwer turned away from her. This was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that my mother telling this unto his wife, and how <hi>Rithimer</hi> ſlighted the ſearch for
me, ſhe beleeved that <hi>Rithimer</hi> had ſent me away, and hid me in ſome place for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>As for my Mother, ſhe knew not whom or what to ſuſpect; one while ſhe thought <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimer</hi>
had raviſhed me away; another while, that it was his wife, who out of jealouſie
had done it; and to thinke of <hi>Clorangus,</hi> ſhe could not imagine he ſhould be any inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in it. And ſo not knowing which to be the cauſe, ſhe ſuſpected both <hi>Rithimer</hi> and
his wife. Hence it was that all three being jealous of each other, they were not very hot
in ſearching for me, but rather laughed at one another when ſuch a thing was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                     <p>This gave we the opportunity of getting out of the Towne by noone, for it being
the market day, we eaſily paſſed amongſt the crowd, none being at the Gates who had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
charge to looke or take any notice of us. So when we were out of the Suburbs of the
Towne, we tooke Horſe, and when we came to a Wood we fell to eat ſuch Victuals as
the young man had provided for us: Then ſetting forward, we travelled all the night,
and the next day till noone; then the young man brought us into a Houſe, the Owner
whereof was a friend unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> and unto whom the young man delivered a Letter
from him, for whoſe ſake we were entertained with all poſſible welcome; but I was ſo
weary with my travell, as I fell aſleep almoſt with the meat in my mouth, ſo as we went
all to bed, and reſted our ſelves here all that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the night following; For my part
I doe not thinke I ever wakened all the time, at leaſt I am ſure the Sun was up before I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
my eyes, and before I got out of my bed; then the young man called me, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
the night had been ſhorter than uſuall: As ſoon as we were all ready, we ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
againe and travelled untill night, when we came to the Towne of the <hi>Libicians</hi> with
all contentment. But I cannot expreſſe the joyes of <hi>Arimant,</hi> when I came unto his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide;
it was ſuch, as his wounds did open again, and began to bleed afreſh as he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to keep his bed ſtill; his joyes were ſo great to ſee me in the houſe, as I beleeve, if I
had not taken notice of it, he had ſaid nothing for fear of affrighting me; but ſeeing his
colour to change, I asked him whether he did not find himſelfe ill: It is nothing, Brother
ſaid he (for ſo it was agreed we ſhould call each other) onely I beſeech you let a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
come to me whilſt you pull off your boots, for though I be in bed, yet I will ſup with
you. Then after I had imbraced him, I called for the Chirurgion, and retired my ſelfe a
little to my Chamber: But oh how jocund were <hi>Clarina</hi> and I when we were together:
for, having paſſed over ſo many frights, we now thought our ſelves returned even from
death to life. Whilſt we were thus rejoycing together, one came to advertiſe us that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>
had loſt ſo much blood, that his wounds were much worſe than they were before,
and he in great danger. I ran in a fright unto him, and found that the blood was ſtopped,
but the Chirurgion deſired me to let him reſt all that night, and told me that there was
no great danger yet, but that there might be, if good heed was not taken. Then was I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to retire my ſelfe without ſeeing him: And ſee, <hi>Hylas,</hi> what love can doe; the day
before I was ſo weary with travelling, as I was not able to keep my eyes open, but now after
as much more pains taken, I could not cloſe an eye all the night long, but was ſtill ſending
to know how <hi>Arimant</hi> did, and could not reſt till the next morning it was permitted me
to ſee him. Brother, ſaid I unto him, were you ſo ill and would not tell me? I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
indeed, ſaid he, that I did perceive my wounds to bleed, but I muſt confeſſe withall,
that I was deſirous to loſe a little blood for you, as in payment of the abundance which
you loſt for me. Oh Brother, ſaid I unto him, our deſignes in that were much different:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53527:81"/>
for in loſing mine, the intent was to preſerve my ſelf for you, but you by this would take
your ſelfe from me.</p>
                     <p>But, <hi>Hylas,</hi> why ſhould I ſtand relating all theſe paſſages, ſince this time, which I muſt
accompt the happieſt of all my life, is thus changed, and nothing remaines of it, but ſo
much memory as to lament the loſſe of it? But however, let me tell you, that after we
had ſtayed ſix weeks in this place, for the recovery of <hi>Arimant,</hi> his Father ſent for him;
for he hearing of the Duell with <hi>Clorangus,</hi> he was in continuall feare of him, not onely
in reſpect of the wounds he had received, but alſo of <hi>Rithimers</hi> hatred. His being thus
ill of his wounds, was the cauſe why he deferred all his deſigns that he had upon me, until
he was better recovered, and quitted his bed. And now when he was recovered and well,
he began to urge me further then I would permit him: I told him, that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
I was his, and that thoſe Teſtimonies which I had given, might well put him out
of all doubt of it: That what he deſired was not reaſonable, unleſſe upon ſuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as might be free form all manner of blame: That he might well thinke, that when
I put my ſelfe into his hands, it was with a deſigne of giving up my ſelf entirely unto him,
as I had done, and yet would doe; but yet I beſeeched him to have regard unto what
both of us ought to doe; for as I owed unto him all manner of contentment and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
ſo he owed unto me the preſervation of that thing, which onely could make me
worthy of him, which was my chaſtity. And when he anſwered, that he never had any
other deſigne; and that he had rather die then move any thing unto me, but upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of marriage, I told him, that it was impoſſible the marriage could be in that place,
but <hi>Rithimer</hi> would know it, and purſue his revenge, and therefore it was requiſite to
deferre unto ſome other time and place which was out of danger. Beſides this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
it were good that his Father were acquainted with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though we were both
reſolved to go through with our deſigne, yet it was but fit and reaſonable to render him
that duty. I put him in minde that the Gods were well pleaſed with the reverence and
obedience of Children to their Parents; and that if we did ſo, they would bleſſe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and actions the better.</p>
                     <p>To be briefe, <hi>Hylas,</hi> I uſed ſo many arguments and reaſons to him, as he taking me in
his armes, and kiſſing me; It is impoſſible (ſaid he) to reſiſt againſt any thing you pleaſe;
and therefore order and diſpoſe of my life and contentment, as you ſhall think good. And
when he received his Fathers command to go unto him; doe you not ſee, ſaid I unto
him, how God begins to proſper our deſigne, ſince we are going unto that place where we
may more eaſily accompliſh it?</p>
                     <p>He therefore went unto him, and carried me alſo; but being unwilling his Father
ſhould know me, before he had conſented unto his marriage, he changed my name, and
called me <hi>Cleomires,</hi> ſaying I was a Tranſalpine <hi>Gaul,</hi> and that I having that language, I
ſhould the better paſſe ſo. Then for a better colour of keeping me with him, he ſaid I had
ſaved his life in his Combate with <hi>Clorangus,</hi> having hindred two of his men in ambuſh
from falling upon him, and forced them to fly; ſo as this generous act forced him never to
part from me.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſet forward in our journey, and arrived at <hi>Eporedes,</hi> where <hi>Arimants</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
received us with ſuch welcome, as did manifeſt the affection which he bore unto his
Son: And when he underſtood me to be <hi>Cleomires,</hi> of whoſe valour and aſſiſtance his
Son had informed him, I cannot expreſſe thoſe thankes and offers which he made unto
me: for truly he was a very noble minded Cavalier, full of virtue, and worthy of the
Title which he had.</p>
                     <p>Both <hi>Arimant</hi> and I were very glad of ſo good a beginning, hoping that ere long this
good entertainment would bring us to a happy concluſion of our deſires. Some dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſt, and <hi>Arimant</hi> not able to reſt until our marriage was concluded, we conſulted
together how to bring it about; In concluſion, we did all foure concur in opinion, (for
<hi>Clarina</hi> and the young man, were alwaies admitted to our Counſells) that the beſt way
was, for me to make the over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ture unto the Father; becauſe ſince I came, I had inſinuated
my ſelfe ſo farre into his good opinion, us he believed whatſoever I ſaid, and would be
counſelled and adviſed unto any thing I would. I took this charge upon me much againſt
my heart, thinking it to be againſt cuſtome for me to be the wooer, it being ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the mans part: Yet having already broken the cuſtomes of other women, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the habit of man, I thought my affection at this time, might well make me undertake
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53527:81"/>
it; and ſeeing it was <hi>Arimants</hi> mind, I thought it a crime to contradict it.</p>
                     <p>I went therefore unto the Father, who was walking by himſelf in the Garden; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a ſalute, and ſome diſcourſe of the fine ſcituation of the place, I fell at length to talk
upon the contentment which every one had in ſeeing themſelves perpetuated in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
And afterwards hinting unto him that it ſhould be his alſo, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but alſo of all <hi>Aemilia;</hi> he anſwered me, that my affection to him, made me
blind, and moved me to think him ſo. I muſt needs confeſſe, Sir, ſaid I unto him, that I
doe love him above any Cavalier I ever knew: but I doe aſſure you, Sir, before I did
love him in that high degree, I did eſteem and thinke him ſo, and all thoſe that ever ſaw
him are of the ſame judgement. But Sir, ſince I am gone ſo farre, give me leave to tell you,
I cannot chuſe but wonder, that it ſhould be ſo long before you marry him; It is full time,
his age requires it; and I believe it would be a great addition of contentment unto you,
to ſee your ſelfe a Grandfather of many ſweet Children it is very true, anſwered he,
and I deſire nothing more; but good wives are ſo very rare, and I ſee ſo few of them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

we muſt of neceſſity tarry till heaven find ſuch a one out for him. Perhaps Sir, ſaid I, you
are too curious in your choice. I beſeech you pardon me, ſaid he, for truly I am not;
provided I could find out a noble and a vertuous woman, in whoſe family there is no
blemiſh, I ſhould not inſiſt muſt upon Riches. Methinkes, Sir, ſaid I unto him, that you
omit one principall quality: What is that, ſaid he, it is, Sir, ſaid I, that they doe
love each other very well. Moſt true, replyed he preſently; but I did not inſert that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
becauſe it is to be firſt preſuppoſed; proteſting unto <hi>Cleomires,</hi> I had rather die, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it was not according to his fancy. In this ſaid I, you are a good Father: But, Sir,
what will you ſay, if I that am a ſtranger, ſhould propoſe one in this Country, who has
all the qualifications and conditions which you mention? and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>one with whom it ſhall
be long of your ſelfe, if it be not a match. I will then ſay, replyed he, that you do know
more then we doe. No, Sir, ſaid I, not that I know more; but becauſe perhaps I have had
more opportunity of knowing her better then others: and if you pleaſe I will propoſe her
unto you, but it ſhall be upon condition, that you honour me ſo farre, as to take all I ſay,
to proceed from one who infinitely honours you, and loves <hi>Arimans</hi> above all the world.
You have already given, my Son, good teſtimony of what you ſay, anſwered he, and
I have ſuch a beliefe of your affection unto me, as you need not queſtion but I ſhall take
whatſoever you propound; as coming from one whom I ought to love, honour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
before any that I know.</p>
                     <p>In this aſſurance Sir, replyed I, I ſhall tell you, that there is one in this very Towne,
whoſe nobleneſſe of Family, virtue, and ſuch love as ought to be betwixt Husband and
Wife, may be found in her; and as for her Portion, it is ſutable to ſuch as are of her qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Theſe things altogether, are not inconſiderable. Good <hi>Cleomires,</hi> ſaid he, name her
quickly. It is, Sir, replyed I and bluſhed, <hi>Cryſeide.</hi> Truly, ſaid he then, as for her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and Portion I muſt needs confeſſe it; but as for the reſt, I know not what to ſay:
and I muſt tell you, the time was when I thought to motion it unto her mother, and had
done it, but that ſhe was ſo neare of kin unto the wife of <hi>Rithimer,</hi> who is my mortall
enemy. Sir, ſaid I unto him, will you be pleaſed to let me ſpeak in her behalfe, without
offence unto your judgement? unto which he anſwering, yes, I went on thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cryſeide</hi> has done two things, which may well make you change your judgement of
her: The firſt is, The cutting her veines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and chuſing rather to die, then marry <hi>Clorangus:</hi>
And the other is, Her flight out of the hands of her Mother. But to cleare theſe two
things unto you, Sir, I muſt diſcover a thing unto you, which I believe you did not know,
and which I beſeech you not to take ill, ſince all due reſpect was ever preſerved unto
you. Be pleaſed therefore to know Sir, that <hi>Arimant</hi> having ſeen her of whom we ſpeak,
and conſidering her beauty, he fell in love with her, and uſed all wayes to make himſelfe
loved: She being ſenſible of the honour which you Son did her; after long Courtſhip,
and ſuch addreſſes as are uſuall amongſt perſons that love, ſhe aked him what his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in it was, <hi>Arimant,</hi> in this, as well as in all other his actions, ſhewed himſelf a noble
Cavalier, and one that did not degenerate from the vertue of his illuſtrious Predeceſſors,
but anſwered her, that his pretenſions were to obtaine her favour in way of marriage:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:53527:82"/>
And when ſhe ſet before him the hatred which <hi>Rithimer</hi> bore unto you, and the neer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
betwixt his wife and her mother; <hi>Arimant</hi> anſwered, that the Gods who would
not have this emnity perpetuall, perhaps intended to reconcile the two Houſes by this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance;
and aſſured himſelfe, that when you Sir were acquainted with it (for he would
do nothing without your permiſſion) you would like of it, and commend his juſt deſign.
After this, Love did every day ſo increaſe on both ſides as they promiſed each other to
marry, provided your approbation could be procured, and in the mean time both of them
to uſe their utmoſt endeavours to obtain the conſent of their Parents.</p>
                     <p>When things was brought to this paſſe, <hi>Chryſeide</hi> was carried away unto <hi>Rithimers</hi>
houſe, where they would needs force her to marry <hi>Clorangus;</hi> you know Sir what kind
of man he was, the moſt deformed and vitiouſly minded of all men living, but though he
had been the moſt compleat and pleaſing, yet <hi>Cryſeide</hi> could not marry him, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
given her ſelfe unto your Son: Yet in this, you may ſee her vertue, becauſe ſhe
had promiſed nothing but upon condition of their conſent upon whom ſhe depended, and
finding their minds ſo far from her deſires, ſhe reſolved to dye; this was an act of vertue
beyond <hi>Lucretia's;</hi> for <hi>Cryſeide</hi> would prevent the crime before hand and dye; but the
other dyed not till after the crime committed. If this be not a great demonſtration of her
love to <hi>Arimant,</hi> and whether ſhe was not reſolved to preſerve her affection intirely for
him, I refer it Sir, unto your judgement. But ſo it was, that ſhe being miraculouſly reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued
from the grave, and began to recover the great loſſe of her blood, ſhe was adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by one of her Mothers maids, that her Mother and <hi>Rithimers</hi> wife would packe her out
of the preſence of that Prince to make her marry <hi>Clorangus</hi> whether ſhe would or no.
Now ſhe thought it high time to have recourſe unto the laſt remedy, and doubtleſſe had
if <hi>Arimant</hi> had not come unto her, and with tears in his eyes diverted her from that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
reſolution, and told her that moſt certainly if ſhe did dye he would follow her, and
therefore it was better to retire her ſelfe from this cruell tyranny of her Mother; that if
ſhe would truſt him, he would vow by all ſacred and inviolable oathes, he would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
her amongſt the Veſtals, where ſhe might ſtay untill he could obtain your approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their marriage.</p>
                     <p>Now Sir, I beſeech you judge whether theſe two actions can be diſliked, or whether
there wanted any either generoſity or love in this woman, or any other quality or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which you can deſire?</p>
                     <p>And thus I ended, extreamly aſtoniſhing the father, who walked two or three turnes
without ſpeaking one word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> whilſt I was in expectation of the ſentence either of life or
death: At laſt lifting up his head which he had all the while hung downe, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thus.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſſe <hi>Cleomire</hi> you have told me moſt ſtrange things, which may well plead
my excuſe for being a little penſive. But conſidering that there is nothing in this world
which comes by chance, but by the wiſe providence of the Gods, I will beleeve that all
theſe things which you have told me, have happened by their wils, &amp; ſince it is ſo, I ſhould
be very harſh if I offer to croſſe them. My Son, you ſay, loves <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> and I do beleeve it,
for I have heard that his voyage to the <hi>Libicians,</hi> was only to make addreſſes unto her, and
fight with <hi>Clorangus</hi> who pretended unto her. <hi>Cryſeide</hi> hath alſo given very great teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of her love to him. I doe conclude from hence, that the Gods do never make ſuch
contraries to meet, and ſympathetically agree, but they are contented with the good will
which is betwixt them. Friend, I do commend my Sons choice, for <hi>Cryſeide</hi> doth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſerve to be loved, and now I know her reaſons which induced her unto what ſhe
did, my eſteem of her is double unto what it was. Tell therefore my Son as much, for I
ſee that it was he who imployed you to ſpeak unto me? Tell him, that ſince according
to his duty he has reſpected me ſo much as not to contract with <hi>Cryſeide</hi> without my
conſent, I doe take it ſo kindly, as I both approve and commend his choice, and pray
unto the Gods that I may ſoon ſee them both together: And though I doe foreſee that
<hi>Richimer</hi> will rage more hatred againſt me, and colour it with my Sons offence in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing
his wifes Cozen out of his houſe, yet that ſhall not make me alter my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
being reſolved to countenance and maintain them in ſpite of all danger that can
come unto me.</p>
                     <p>I beleeve <hi>Hylas,</hi> you thinke that this anſwer did give me as much contentment as I
could deſire, and well you might; for after I kneeled downe and thanked him in behalf
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53527:82"/>
of his Son and <hi>Cryſeide</hi> (not daring to declare my ſelfe without the advice of my dear <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimant</hi>)
I thought he would never have ſatisfied himſelfe with thanking me, hugging and
kiſſing me. Then I parted from him, and went to acquaint <hi>Arimant</hi> with my happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
which raviſhed him beyond all expreſſion: At laſt it was reſolved amongſt us, that
ſince I had told his Father I was amongſt the Veſtals, I ſhould not yet declare my ſelfe, leſt
I ſhould be taken in a lie; For all lies have this quality, that when they are known, they
make truth it ſelfe ſuſpected. And to avoid the rage of <hi>Rithimer</hi> and my mother we
thought it beſt to conceale our marriage for a while, whilſt in the mean time endeavours
were uſed to pacific them: <hi>Arimants</hi> Father approved of this, and from thence forward
referred the whole matter unto the will of his Son.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Hylas</hi> ſee, how men purpoſe, and God diſpoſeth, who would have thought but
that their buſineſſe was brought to as good a paſſe as we could wiſh or expect? And yet
all our croſſes hitherto were but playes in compariſon of what enſued; For <hi>Arimant</hi> and
I deſiring to conſummate our deſign, pretended to go unto <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> and after we had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
womens cloths, and all that was neceſſary for our marriage, and were come into
a Towne of the <hi>Caturges,</hi> we intended to ſtay there ſo long as to make the father beleeve
we were gone unto her whom we had with us. But as ill luck was, <hi>Gundehunt</hi> King of the
<hi>Burgundians</hi> having paſſed over the Alps with a puiſſant Army, did fall into the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of the <hi>Taurinois</hi> and <hi>Caturges</hi> ſo unexpectedly as he found them without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or thoughts of any Enemy: And by fortune, the very next day we came into this
Towne, he fell upon it, where all they could do was to ſhut the Gates againſt the ſurpriſe
of the firſt Comers; but when the maine body of the army came up, all the inhabitants
could then do was to render their Town upon ſuch pittifull condition as little mended the
matter, unleſſe that the women were not raviſhed nor their Temples pillaged as they were
in other places, and all the reſt left to the diſcretion of the ravenous Souldier.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Hylas</hi> what a lamentable ſight was it to ſee women carried away Captives out of
the arms of their husbands: No intreaties, no tears, nor no offers could redeeme them:
So ſadly did I reſent this miſery, as I can ſpeake it experimentally: as fortune was, I was
that day in woman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> habit, and as I thought not ill dreſſed, though my haire was ſo ſhort
that I could not trim my ſelfe ſo well as I deſired; and poor <hi>Arimant</hi> did caraſſe me, as
if he did foreſee it ſhould be the laſt time: The Towne was preſently diſtributed into
quarters; and every place aſſigned unto ſome troope, who by degrees turned the Owners
out of doors, both men, moveables and horſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Arimant</hi> hearing of this baſe capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
went crying through the Towne, that it was better to dye than ſubmit unto ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
termes, telling the people that their wals were yet up, that the Enemies had no
wings to fly over them, that their arrowes were not all ſpent, nor their bowes broken:
he promiſed them that he would defend their Towne till <hi>Rithimer</hi> came to relieve them,
who was already upon his march, and that they ſhould never be branded with ſo much ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy.
But ſeeing there was no remedy, and that none ſtirred upon his words, he drew
his Sword, and cryed in the open ſtreets that the principals of the Towne had betrayed
and ſold the people; that for their parts they would receive no harm, but all would fall
upon the poor people, ſo as it was better to give them up to the Enemy, and ſave the reſt:
And thus he cryed out ſo lowd, as he was followed by ſome, with whom he ſeized upon
a Gate, which he defended ſo well, that <hi>Gondebunt</hi> was forced to retreat, and fall on upon
another Quarter, where the Inhabitants did let him in: And thus betrayed by thoſe of
the place, whilſt he was repulſing thoſe Enemies which were before him, he was aſſaulted
ſo furiouſly upon the backe, as at laſt, vertue being over powred by number, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
many wounds, he was taken and killed, though he would never yeild, chuſing
rather to dye, then fall into the hands of thoſe, whom he called <hi>Barbarians.</hi> As for me,
to my miſery, though I may call it good fortune, that part of the Towne where I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be was aſſigned for the Quarter of King <hi>Gondebunt;</hi> and thoſe who were with
him tooke me and many other Ladies priſoners, and all committed to ſafe cuſtody; where
we ſtayed untill the coming of this great King, in hopes his generoſity would give us li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
as well as his vertue had preſerved out chaſtity.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Hylas</hi> you know both me and my fortune which I beleeve you will thinke to be

                     <p>Thus has the fair <hi>Cryſeide</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) related her fortune unto me, and I was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53527:83"/>
with it, as I did not thinke it a quarter of an houre ſince her firſt beginning,
when it was ſo late, that all her companions came to tell her it was time to retire. And
waiting upon them unto the ſide of the River <hi>Arar,</hi> I then retired as full of love, as I
was of ſatisfaction, to know that this faire one had learned how to love, and that her
affection was not ſettled any where, ſince the death of <hi>Arimant,</hi> which gave me abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of hope to arrive at the Port of my deſires.</p>
                     <p>All the company ſtood very attentive, and deſirous to heare the concluſion of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
<hi>Hylas</hi> ſtood ſilent, and ſo as it ſeemed as if it was onely becauſe they were then
come unto a place where onely one could paſſe at once: And when all were paſſed, thy
flocked about him, as deſirous to heare the continuation of his diſcourſe, giving great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
unto it. What? what doe you expect more from me? ſaid he, and wondred
they ſhould expect it: If there be any amongſt you, that knowes any more of the ſtory
then I have related, I ſhall willingly lend them audience; but if you look for any more
from me, good friends, you will be miſtaken, for I have not a jot more to tell you. All the
company broke out into laughter to ſee their expectations thus fruſtrated. Servant, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> did you thinke that you performed your promiſe with this ſhort come
off? Did you not promiſe me a relation of your ſeverall loves? and you have related
onely the misfortunes of <hi>Cryſeide</hi> and <hi>Arimant:</hi> you have told us what you did not
promiſe, and left untold that which you did promiſe; reſembling thoſe who had rather
give where they doe not owe, then pay their due debts. <hi>Hylas</hi> being thus twitted, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and ſaid not a word, knowing that <hi>Alexis</hi> was in the right. At laſt caſting up his
head; Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, I doe confeſſe all you ſay, but the fault is your own: but if
the money which I payed you was not good, why did not you refuſe it: I mean, if you
did not like what I told, why did you not interrupt me? for my part, I thought the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
ſo good, that when I received it from <hi>Cryſeide</hi> it contented me, and was pleaſed with
the repetition of it unto you. However, ſaid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and interrupted, ſince you have
begun the ſtory of this generous Lady, you ſhould have ended it: I aſſure you, Sir, ſaid
<hi>Hylas,</hi> I have emptied my Purſe of all that money: I mean, that I know no more of
<hi>Cryſeides</hi> ſtory, onely this, that ſhe went away without bidding adieu unto any, and I
could never hear, whither. Madam, ſaid <hi>Florice</hi> then, and turned towards <hi>Alexis,</hi> are
you deſirous to heare the concluſion of that ſtory? Yes, anſwered the Druid, and I ſhould
be obliged unto thoſe that would tell it me, and I believe the reſt of our way will permit
it. I ſhall be very glad, replyed <hi>Florice,</hi> to ſatisfie your curioſity; for <hi>Cryſeide</hi> ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of <hi>Hylas,</hi> related unto me at <hi>Lyons,</hi> all that he hath, and that I ſhall tell you,
But it ſhall be upon this condition, that <hi>Hylas</hi> ſhall make good his promiſe another
time; and he aſſuring her he would, ſhe began thus:</p>

                     <p>BE pleaſed to know, Madam, that this generous Lady being detained a Priſoner in
<hi>Lyons</hi> as you have heard, going one morning unto the Temple, a young man came
unto her, and in the croud did put a little Book into her hand, and ſaid unto her in the
Italian language, To morrow about this time you ſhall ſee me here, and ſuddainly thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelfe among the people he left her in the greateſt aſtoniſhment that ever was; for
ſhe knew him not, not underſtood the meaning of this little Book; yet being very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
ſhe made no ſhew of her amazement onely as long as divine ſervice laſted, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched
<hi>Mercury</hi> to grant that it might be good newes. The Sacrifice ſeemed longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her then ordinary; and being extreamly impatient to know what this Book was, ſhe
opened it: her Companions who ſaw her very intent upon it, thought it to be a Prayer
Book, as indeed it was, and never took notice of any thing elſe: After ſhe had turned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
many leaves and found nothing, ſhe was more zealous in her devotion unto <hi>Mercury</hi>

this, never remembring all this while the way of conveying Letters betwixt poor <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>

ſuch a Book; but at laſt, looking upon it more preciſely, and turning over more leaves,
ſhe found a Letter, the ſuperſcription of which ſhe knew; Oh how ſhe was ſtartled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

took great notice of it, onely thought that her ſtay proceeded from her devotion. At
the laſt, her companion pulled her by the ſleeve, and made her follow the reſt who walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

ſhe knew that he was alive: ſhe fell down upon her knees, and lifted up her eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Bleſſed be the Gods, ſaid ſhe, for this tranſcendent happineſſe, when I had the leaſt
hopes of it. Afterwards riſing up, ſhe ſat down upon the bed, where ſhe kiſſed the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a hundred times, accuſed her ſelfe of oblivion, for not knowing him who brought
it; and calling her memory to account, ſhe knew him to be the faithfull <hi>Bellaris,</hi> that
young man who uſed to bring Letters from <hi>Arimant,</hi> and brought her from her Mother
unto <hi>Arimant.</hi> Where were my eyes (ſaid ſhe to her ſelfe) and where was my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that ſeeing him, and hearing his voice, yet I ſhould neither know his face nor his

the Character of <hi>Arimant:</hi> Oh ye Gods, ſaid ſhe, I thank you moſt heartily for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my life ſo long, as to heare this good newes. I praiſe ye, oh ſoveraign Goodneſſes,
and I now deſire no more, but onely to be ſo happy as that theſe eyes may ſee him, and
that this mouch which hath ſo often lamented him, may kiſſe him. She had continued
longer, if <hi>Clarina</hi> who would neverforſake her, had to come to look her; ſhe opened
the door unto her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh <hi>Clarina,</hi> ſaid ſhe, and kiſſed her; I have good news to tell you;
but <hi>Clarina</hi> telling her that dinner was upon the Table, and that every one ſtayed for
her, ſhe could not then tell her any more; but the joyes of her face did ſufficiently ſpeak
the inward contentment of her ſoul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cryſeide</hi> did love <hi>Clarina</hi> very well, but though ſhe had loved her leſſe, ſhe would
willingly have loſt her dinner to tell her this newes; for it is the quality of all thoſe who
receive any great contentment, never to thinke it compleat, until they have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
it unto thoſe they love. On the other ſide, <hi>Clarina</hi> was ſo netled with impatience,
that ſhe no ſooner ſaw her Miſtreſſe from the Table, but ſhe followed her into the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
where ſhe found her before; and the door being ſhut, Oh <hi>Clarina,</hi> ſaid ſhe, and took
her about the neck, Oh my deare friend, I have great newes to tell you. Know, my

<hi>Clarina,</hi> replyed <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> he is alive, and has ſent me this Letter: and now I value not
all my miſeries, ſince he is alive to helpe me in ſupporting them. But, Madam, I beſeech
you, ſaid <hi>Clarina,</hi> How came you to know all this? Here ſweet-heart (ſaid ſhe, and gave
her the little Book) here is the meſſenger of the welcome newes. <hi>Clarina</hi> then tooke the
Book, and kiſſed it a hundred times, and did ſo wet it with teares of joy, as <hi>Cryſeide</hi>
ſaid unto her; Oh <hi>Clarina,</hi> you ſpoile it with your teares, methinks you ſhould bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
preſerve it: Then whilſt <hi>Clarina</hi> took the Letter in it, and read it, <hi>Cryſeide</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto her all the paſſage in the Temple, and how ſhe did not know <hi>Bellaris,</hi> whom
yet ſhe hoped to ſee againe the next day when ſhe went againe; but if by fortune I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſpeak unto him by reaſon of my companions, and others who have eyes upon me.
Then <hi>Clarina,</hi> ſaid ſhe, you muſt by any means go unto him, and enquire how all ſquares
go with my dear <hi>Arimant:</hi> In the mean time, provide me Pen, Ink and Paper, that I may
return an anſwer. I ſhall not faile, Madam, anſwered <hi>Clarina,</hi> and it ſhall go hard but I
will ſpeak with him; for in this Country they are not ſo circumſpect over us, as in ours.
But, Madam, let us not ſtay too long together here, leſt we ſhould give any cauſe of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
unto thoſe who guard us. True, <hi>Clarina</hi> (anſwered <hi>Cryſeide</hi>) the Gods have

ſent thee into the world to be my comfort and Counſellor.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, they went out of the Cloſet unto the reſt of the Ladies Priſoners, who began
already to aske where <hi>Cryſeide</hi> was; for ſhe having the firſt rank, ſhe could not be well
miſſed; and beſides ſhe was ſo exceedingly loved of them all, as there was not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them who would not ſerve her with their lives. She began therefore a hundred

For <hi>Gondebunt</hi> had in his abſence commanded they ſhould be ſo treated, as that
they ſhould have no cauſe to grieve for being out of their Country.</p>
                     <p>This day ſeemed long unto <hi>Cryſeide</hi> and <hi>Clarina,</hi> and the night longer; and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

At laſt, the ſo much deſired hour being come, they went together: And <hi>Cryſeide</hi>
caſt her eyes on both ſides, in hopes of ſeeing <hi>Rellaris;</hi> and ſhe had no ſooner received
the holy water at her entrance into the Temple, but ſhe eſpied him, ſtaying there purpoſly
the better to ſee her when ſhe paſſed. <hi>Cryſeide</hi> going as neere unto him as well ſhe could,
had no more leiſure as ſhe paſſed by, but to ſay unto him; <hi>Clarina</hi> followes me; he
quickly underſtood her meaning, and conceiving it the beſt way to avoid ſuſpition; he
looked about for her paſſing by, which was after all the Ladies; and becauſe the women
went without order, he thruſt in amongſt them, and going neer her, he ſaid unto her, and
looked another way as he walked; Where may I meet you Madam? In the <hi>Athenian</hi>

                        </gap> Upon this, ſhe lifted up her eyes unto heaven, and went on, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void

know where this <hi>Athenian</hi> Garden was, and being informed of every thing, he went
unto the Gardiner, and for money got leave to walke there, when he would: For the

walke for recovery of his health. Having therefore put his buſineſſe into ſuch good order,
he went to the ſide of the River <hi>Arar,</hi> that he might ſee when they went unto the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, as ſoon as Sacrifice was done <hi>Clarina</hi> acquainted her Miſtreſſe with
the diſcourſe ſhe had with <hi>Bellaris,</hi> and how it was appointed to goe that day unto the
<hi>Athenian</hi> garden; how he aſſured her, <hi>Arimant</hi> was in good health, and could not have
any more particulars from him, the reaſon was, becauſe the place was not convenient, and
it may be he deſired to tell the good News unto you firſt: I do like very well of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi>
garden, anſwered <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> becauſe there none will interrupt us. They had tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
longer if dinner had not beene upon the Table, and becauſe <hi>Cryſeide</hi> did paſſionately
deſire to ſpeake with the truſty <hi>Bellaris,</hi> ſhe went to walke ſomething ſooner than uſuall,
and all the Company did like well of her humour.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Bellaris</hi> ſaw her enter into the boat, for the River <hi>Arar</hi> was betwixt the

in their Chambers did not go with them, but might goe into the Towne with any of
the guard, and this was the reaſon why <hi>Cryſeide</hi> went alone. As ſoone as ſhe was entred,

I thinke my ſelfe commanded unto it, unleſſe I were the moſt ungrateful perſon that lives.
<hi>Cryſeide</hi> was a little ſurpriſed, and not knowing how to ſpeak, was a little ſilent; and this
made thoſe who looked upon her to be leſſe ſuſpitious. And becauſe <hi>Bellaris</hi> ſaw ſhe was

remember the benefits I have received, as I would at the perill of my life doe her any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
I was brought into this place not as a Priſoner, but as a ſervant unto <hi>Martiantes,</hi>
a Cavalier well known in that Province: he was taken and killed by a company of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
at the foot of the <hi>Pirennian</hi> hills, who left me for dead by him, but the Gods Kept
me alive, to bring the ſad newes unto his friends, and to lament the loſſe all the dayes of
my life. Alas (ſaid <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> ſeeming to be ſorry) is <hi>Martiantes</hi> dead? He is, Madam,
anſwered <hi>Bellaris.</hi> I aſſure you, ſaid he, I am very ſorry for it, for he was a Cavalier
of great merit. Upon this, all the Ladies divided themſelves into ſeverall walkes, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Cryſeide</hi> alone with <hi>Bellaris:</hi> and when ſhe ſaw none were in the compaſſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
Ah my friend <hi>Bellaris,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him in a low voyce, now tell me, how does
my deare <hi>Arimant,</hi> and through what fortunes has he paſſed? Madam, anſwered he, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimant</hi>
is in health; but as for his fortune, it hath been very various, and I doubt I ſhall
not have time to relate it I believe we ſhall anſwered ſhe, and if we have not, we will
take another time for the reſt. Then, Madam, ſaid he, I will be as briefe as I can: Be
pleaſed to know, that <hi>Arimant</hi> being ſo baſely forſaken by the Townſmen where we
were, he ſtill defended himſelfe moſt valiantly a long time, and at laſt was left for dead:
Doubtleſſe but for me, he had never eſcaped; but I being near him, I uſed ſuch care as I
was obliged unto; though I was much wounded, yet not being ſo bad as he I feigned my
ſelfe dead and fell at his feet, for he was faln to the ground: The enemy having other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
then riffling the dead, all the Plunder of the Town being theirs, they left us; and
when I ſaw the coſt cleare, I roſe up, and bound up my wounds as well as I could; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
went to my Maſter, and by the help of a young man of the Town, I carried him
unto an uninhabited ſtable which was neare, not daring to carry him into any houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all were full of Souldiers; I had an opinion, that he was not quite dead, thinking
the Gods would never ſuffer ſuch a brave man to go out of the world in the flower of his
age; I ſearched his wounds, and to the beſt of my poor skill, I did not thinke them mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but not knowing well what to do, and ſeeing him bleed ſtill, I tore my ſhirt, and
tyed up his wounds as well as I could, and laying his head in my lap, it pleaſed God that
he revived: when he opened his eyes, he wondered to ſee where he was, and I fearing his
aſtoniſhment might do him hurt; courage, Sir, ſaid I unto him, the Gods will ſend us
better fortune: The Gods, <hi>Bellaris</hi> (ſaid he) are indeed very good, but my deſtiny is
bad, ſo as I can hope for no reſt but in death: But <hi>Bellaris,</hi> what is become of <hi>Cryſeide?</hi>
                        <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> anſwered I, is ſafe, the wife to the <hi>Burgundian</hi> King, who followes him all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
cauſed all the women to be put into the Temple there to be preſerved from diſorder,
and keeps <hi>Cryſeide</hi> particularly with her. Heaven be her reward, ſaid he, forſo good a
deed.</p>
                     <p>I feigned all this, Madam, leſt his griefe ſhould have cauſed his death. But, Sir, ſaid I
unto him, doe not trouble your ſelfe too much: No, no, ſaid he, now <hi>Cryſeide</hi> is out of
danger, I care not for any thing elſe. Then, though with a little difficulty, I got him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his feet, which was no ſooner done, but we heard many Souldiers quarrelling at the
ſtable door; and preſently after, drawing their ſwords, they fell to fighting, about ſome
Plunder which they had gotten, and could not agree about the Diviſion: The diſpute
was ſo hot that many were killed; and the noiſe encreaſing, many others aſſembled, who
as ſoon as they came, took ſides; at laſt, a Captain paſſing by, and ſeeing this diſorder, he
would needs regulate the matter; But the Souldiers thinking he would take all their Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53527:85"/>
from them, in lieu of obeying, fell upon him, and ſo, as he was forced to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by running to the ſtable door where we were. The Souldiers who had laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
all reſpect, and knew that if he eſcaped their hands, he would have them all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
they reſolved to kill him, hoping then to be ſafe and enjoy their Plunder. In order to
this deſigne, they endeavoured to enter in; which <hi>Arimant</hi> conſidering, let us defend this
Captain, ſaid he, perhaps heaven ſent him for our aſſiſtance, ſo as if we doe him a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,
he will doe the like for us: Upon this, drawing both our ſwords, we took his part;
and though my Maſter was much wounded, yet his courage which never failed him, gave
him ſtrength enough to repell the fury of theſe ſouldiers; ſome were killed, others taken,
and the reſt fled.</p>
                     <p>The Captaine ſeeing himſelfe out of danger, and not knowing <hi>Arimant:</hi> Cavalier,
ſaid he unto him, I am obliged unto your valour for my life; and in requitall of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
which I have received from you; command me any ſervice within the compaſſ
of my power, and I ſhall be moſt ready to doe it. Sir, ſaid my Maſter, I was obliged unto
all I did, and if I have done you any ſervice, I deſire no other recompence, but that you
will take me as your Priſoner, and uſe me like a Cavalier, as both you and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>are. The
Captaine upon this looking better upon him, and ſeeing by his habit that he was no <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundian,</hi>
he ſaid thus unto him: Sir, I do receive you as you deſire, not to uſe you as a
Priſoner, but as my friend, and a Cavalier of merit. Alſo I paſſe my word, I will rather
die, then you ſhall receive any diſpleaſure from our Army.</p>
                     <p>Thus was <hi>Arimant</hi> and I, under the protection of this Captaine whoſe name was
<hi>Bellima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t,</hi> a man indeed of great Credit, but much devoted unto his wealth, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
we found, and who according to the cuſtome of the <hi>Viſigots</hi> did ſeldome remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
any benefits; for though he was a <hi>Viſigot</hi> yet he followed the King of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi>
as a perſon who ſought for fortune whereſoever he was in hopes to find it. The firſt day,
we received all the kind uſage we could expect upon ſuch an occaſion; But the next day,
being better informed of the quality of his Priſoner, by ſome in the Town, he began to
keep us under better guard, pretending it was becauſe he would have us keep our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
that our wounds might ſooner heale, forbidding any to ſpeak with us: Afterwards,
ſeeing the Army was to move, and he not knowing whither, he took my Maſter apart,
and told him, that in performance of his word, he was forced to ſend him over the Alpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;
becauſe the King being informed, that it was he who had raiſed the oppoſition in the
Town, and had cauſed the death of many of his men; he has commanded him to be
ſearched for throughout all the Army, intending to put him to death, as a terrour unto
the neighbouring Towns: that perhaps he could make a ſhift to protect him againſt any
but the authority of the King: That he would willingly let him paſſe free amongſt his
own Souldiers if he durſt, but it would hazard his life if the King ſhould heare he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſuch a thing without his conſent: yet on the contrary, he could without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
ſend him beyond the Alpes, ſince it was permitted unto all the Souldiers to ſend
their Priſoners and Pillage thither. But as ſoon as the Army was returned unto <hi>Bungun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi>
he would ſend him back unto <hi>Eporedes,</hi> or any other place he pleaſed. <hi>Arimant</hi> then
asked him, whether the Queen had ſent her Priſoners thither alſo? The Queen, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Captaine, is not here; but they have ſent their Priſoners thither, to the end the
Army may be diſcharged of them. My Maſter looked upon me, as if he had ſaid, you
are miſtaken, and afterwards continued; I will go, ſaid he, whither you pleaſe, aſſuring
my ſelfe that a Cavalier ſo courteous and noble as you are, will not uſe me otherwiſe
then is fitting for a perſon of my quality, and as one may expect from ſuch a Cavalier
as you are.</p>
                     <p>Do the next morning betimes, not without great danger of my Maſters life, by reaſon
of his wounds, we were carried away by aconvoy, which guarded many other Priſoners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not
knowing Madam, what was become of you; onely that the King had put all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
together, leſt they ſhould receive any injury. After we had paſſed the Alpes, they
brought us unto this Town; and preſently after, being parted from the reſt, they carryed
us into the <hi>Seguſian</hi> Country, by the Mountaines of <hi>Gebennes:</hi> And at laſt, they put us
up cloſe into a little Caſtle neare the Town of <hi>Gergov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>:</hi> Well may I ſay [cloſe up] for we
were guarded ſo cloſe, that we hardly ſaw any light, and ſo we continued for a time:
but the merit, and ſweet converſation of my Maſter, did work ſo well upon this harſh
Keeper, and the promiſes I made to gratifie his courteſie, when <hi>Bellimart</hi> gave him liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53527:85"/>
did move him to let me go out and treat with him about our enlargement. This, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
has been my Maſters fortune; but nothing touches him ſo at heart, as being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of your eſtate; hearing onely in generall, that you were in the hands of the King.
It was not any deſire of his enlargement, or treating with <hi>Bellim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </hi> which brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but only to know in what part of the world you were, or whether you ſtill retained
any memory of him.</p>
                     <p>How? replyed <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> any memory of him? what ſhould I elſe have an my memory
but him? Yes, yes, <hi>Bellaris,</hi> I muſt be dead, before <hi>Arimant</hi> be out of my memory. The
Gods doe know, there is not a day, nor an hour, nor a minute, in which <hi>Clarina</hi> and I
have not talked of him with eyes full of teares. Now my deare friend, I will declare one
thing unto you, which I have not yet mentioned unto any; but finding my ſelfe in this
condition, and foreſeeing that it will be worſe with me, I am forced to tell it unto you,
that by your Counſell I may find a remedy. Know <hi>Bellaris,</hi> that <hi>Gondebunt</hi> the King of
<hi>Burgundie,</hi> is faln in love with me; I know it both by his deportment towards me, and
his expreſſions. I would not upon any termes reject him at the firſt, becauſe an incenſed
love may drive a man unto violent courſes: but after I had given him many thanks for the
honour he did me; I told him, that I was none of the common ſort of people, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of the beſt Families amongſt the <hi>Sallaſſes: Rithimers</hi> wife, who was ſiſter
unto the Emperour <hi>Anthemius,</hi> was my near Couſin: That this conſideration might
well move him to treat me according to my quality; and by this meanes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e might not
onely make <hi>Rithimer</hi> his friend, but <hi>Anthensius</hi> alſo who was allied unto me. Unto this
he returned no other anſwer than this, that I did him great a favour in telling him as
much; and that upon his returne he would make it appeare, how much he eſteemed my
merit, and my alliance. Now <hi>Bellaris,</hi> I do foreſee a ſharp Combate: For I am told that
the King is upon his return, and I ſee all preparations are making for him: Perhaps he
may change his humour and fancy to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perhaps not: Now if he doe continue it,
judge you, how I ſhall be perſecuted. To marry him, I had rather die: To refuſe him,
he is a young arrogant man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s what can I doe; ſo as I doe foreſee a moſt dangerous ſtorme of miſery hanging over
my head, and know not how to ſhelter my ſelfe from it, unleſſe you adviſe me in this
great neceſſity. <hi>Bellaris</hi> ſtood a while and ſpoke not a word, at laſt he ſaid unto her;
Truly, Madam, theſe conſiderations doe ſpeake you full of affection unto my Maſter:
and it muſt needs be confeſſed, that he is infinitely obliged unto you, in ſlighting this
King to preſerve your ſelfe for him: I will moſt freely expoſe my life to doe you both any
faithfull ſervice: I beſeech you, Madam, therefore tell me, Doe they keep you very
cloſe? You ſee, ſaid <hi>Cryſeide:</hi> if they uſe you no worſe then ſo, replyed he, you may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſcape: But ſaid ſhe, if I ſhould make an eſcape, whither can I go? For, to paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Alpes, is the way to be taken againe, it is impoſſible to avoid it: Never trouble
your ſelfe, Madam, ſaid he, ſo you could get but out of this Town; I know a place
whither to carry you, where you may ſtay in ſafety, untill <hi>Arimant</hi> be gotten out of the
place where he is, by a way that I have thought upon; and when you are both together, I
am confident you will contrive a way how to paſſe into <hi>Italy.</hi> Oh my dear friend, ſaid ſhe,
Couldſt thou but doe as thou ſayſt, my obligation to thee would be extream; if thou
canſt but get a Boat upon the River <hi>Arar</hi> under my window, it is ſo near the ground,
that by the help of thy hand, I could come down in the night. Enough, ſaid he, I can do
it; but how ſhall we paſſe the Chaines which are at the end of the Town, before we come
to the River? Friend, replyed ſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God will help us; and if thou wilt but take a little
paines, thou wilt eaſily find the meanes; for I have heard that others have eſcaped the
ſame way: But Horſes muſt be provided for <hi>Clarina,</hi> for thee, and for me, and that I
look upon as the greateſt difficulty; for whom canſt thou truſt to hold them? That is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
anſwered he, for I will get one to hold him, who ſhall not know what he does:
But the worſt is, I have not money to buy Horſes or Boat, or to make you clothes in the
faſhion of that Country: for the ſouldiers have gotten all I had, and my Maſters alſo.
Let that be the leaſt of thy cares, ſaid <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> for I have yet good ſtore of Rings: then
pulling a Diamant of good value from her finger, ſhe gave it to him: Go friend, (ſaid
ſhe) ſell it, and buy ſuch things as thou wilt; if that will not ſerve, thou ſhalt have
more.</p>
                     <p>It is not materiall to relate every particular; <hi>Bellaris</hi> provided Clothes, bought Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53527:86"/>
found a Boat, and all with ſuch expedition, that in two dayes all was in readineſs.</p>
                     <p>In the meane while, he took notice of the place where they were to paſſe, where their
Horſes ſhould ſtay, and of every circumſtance: And the Chaine, being onely Boats faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together a croſs the River; he went the night before and filed the ring of one Boat,
ſo as it was held together by a little ſtrength. All things being thus ready, and the
hour appointed being come, <hi>Cryſeide</hi> roſe out of bed, and <hi>Clarina</hi> alſo; And being in
their firſt ſleeps in the dead of the night, they went out of the window without any noiſe,
and took Boat; and <hi>Bellaris</hi> being their conductor, puſhed the Boat from the ſhore, and
hit right upon the Boat whoſe ring he had filed, which breaking out right, with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
noiſe as he could for feare of being heard by the Guards, he paſſed through with his
Boat, though a little after they were all in great danger of being drowned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the
<hi>Roſne,</hi> into which the River <hi>Arar</hi> runs, it was ſo rough, and the Boat ſo little, alſo the
Waterman not being very skilfull, as the danger was great, but at laſt he gained the ſhore:
And though it was much lower then he aimed at, yet by the help of the Moon which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſhine, he found the place where a little boy held their Horſes, who alſo promiſed
him to be his guid.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt they were fitting all things about the Horſes, <hi>Cryſeide</hi> and <hi>Clarina</hi> did take
their new habits, which what by reaſon of haſte, and darkneſſe together, they did put
on ſo il-favouredly, as if they were ſome mungrell Gentlewomen that would be fine if
they knew how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But being as they were they took Horſe and paſſed through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the <hi>Seguſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ans,</hi> carrying ſtill their guid with them, leſt he ſhould make ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery:
And after they had with much wearineſſe paſſed the <hi>Cemmenian</hi> Mountaines,
travelling more by night then day, and eating alwaies in ſome wood, in which the
Country was abundant; they came at laſt to the Town of <hi>Gergovia,</hi> in which <hi>Cryſeide</hi>
was not afraid to lodge, becauſe it was in the Dominions of <hi>Eurick</hi> King of the <hi>Viſigots.</hi>
She took up her lodgings therefore in an Inn; and the faithfull <hi>Bellaris</hi> went the next
morning unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> unto whom dayes ſeemed very long, little expecting to hear ſuch
good newes ſo ſoon: <hi>Cryſeide</hi> had given <hi>Bellaris</hi> another Ring of very good value,
to the end that if he who guarded <hi>Arimant</hi> would be corrupted, he might give it unto
him, and promiſe him more if need were.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as he was returned, the Captaine of the Caſtle brought him to his Maſter:
Come friend, ſaid <hi>Arimant</hi> unto him, doſt thou bring me Life or Death? Sir, anſwered
he aloud, I doe not bring any bad newes, onely that King <hi>Gondebunt</hi> being not returned,
the valiant <hi>Bellimart</hi> is not returned neither, ſo as I have loſt my journey. I met with one
that was your Couſin, who was very inquiſitive of you, and offers you all aſſiſtance unto
the King and <hi>Bellimart,</hi> and is confident of finding favour, otherwiſe my journey is to
no purpoſe: and I believe that ere long; I muſt have another; for the King is dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
You had done very well to have ſtayed, ſaid <hi>Arimant,</hi> and not returned with
ſo little contentment unto me. Sir, anſwered he, I was in feare you would have thought
my ſtay too long; and having none to wait upon you I thought it better to return, then
ſtay ſo long to no purpoſe. Then the Captaine began to ſpeak; you had better have ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſaid he, then make another journey; for according to the intelligence which we have,
if the King be not come already, he will not ſtay long.</p>
                     <p>But as ſoon as the Captaine was gone, and they two alone, <hi>Bellaris</hi> fell down upon his
knee, took his Maſters hand, kiſſed it, and with a ſmiling countenance, ſaid unto him;
I perceive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir, you are diſpleaſed with my journey, but I believe you will bid me wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
when you know all How does <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> ſaid <hi>Arimant?</hi> Does ſhe endure her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
well, and does ſhe ſtill love me? Suppoſe, Sir, replyed, <hi>Bellaris,</hi> I ſhould bring
you better newes then all this; would you then ſay I were welcome? What better newes
(ſaid <hi>Arimant</hi>) canſt thou bring then this? I will not onely tell you, Sir, replyed
<hi>Bellaris,</hi> That <hi>Cryſeide</hi> is well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ſhe loves you as well as ever: But more, ſhe is
at liberty: nay more yet, ſhe is coming to you; <hi>Clarina</hi> and ſhe doe ſtay for you in
<hi>Gergovia, Bellaris,</hi> ſaid the Cavalier and ſmiled, is this all true thou ſayſt? Doe you
thinke, Sir, ſaid this faithful ſervant, that I would bring you any lies? The goodneſſe of
the Gods be praiſed, ſaid <hi>Arimant,</hi> and lifted up his hands and eyes to heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himſelf towards <hi>Bellaris:</hi> But friend, is it poſſible all this ſhould be ſo? Can ſo much
happineſſe come all at once? Sir, anſwered he, doe not make any doubt of what I ſay;
and to teſtifie my affection and fidelity, you may to morrow, if you will, ſee this fair one,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53527:86"/>
who has taken ſo much paines to give you contentment: but then I am afraid it will be
the laſt ſervice I ever ſhall doe you: Alas, ſaid <hi>Arimant,</hi> I would not buy my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at ſo dear a rate as the loſſe of thee; but if it could be any otherwiſe, I ſhould be
moſt heartily glad of it. I will tell you, Sir, ſaid he, what I did determine to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then
he began to relate unto him, how he met with <hi>Cryſeide</hi> in the Temple, and in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
her reſolution to eſcape, how they got away, how ſhe was in <hi>Ger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

habite where ſhe expected him, and briefly all the whole paſſage. Then he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Now, Sir, you muſt make all the haſte you can to get from hence for doubtleſſe,
King <hi>Gondebunt</hi> is even very now upon his return; and then you may aſſure your ſelte,
that <hi>Bellimart</hi> will either come or ſend for you; you know his covetous and greedy
mind, and God knowes how he will uſe you: you may remember his ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, and you cannot hope for any courteſie from him, who has ſhewed himſelfe
already ſo unworthy. Beſides, it is impoſſible that <hi>Cryſeide</hi> ſhould ſtay long where ſhe is,
and <hi>Gondebunt</hi> not be advertiſed of it; and you muſt know, how that King is ſo much in
love with her, as he has declared ſome intention of marrying her. You ſee therefore
it is full time to make all poſſible haſte out of this Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and judge whether or no
<hi>Cryſeide</hi> love you, chuſing rather to run all theſe hazards for your ſake, then to marry ſo

ſome hurt, and if it could be contrived ſome other way it would be better. No, no,
Sir, ſaid <hi>Bellaris,</hi> there is no other way: For in the firſt place, time does preſſe you, and
there is no probability that this man who guards you, will be corrupted by Gifts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he thinkes your Ranſome will be very high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is probable that <hi>Bellimart</hi> has
promiſed him a ſhare. And as for me never let it trouble you for I am confident the Gods
will help thoſe who hope in them, and are faithful to their Maſters, by ſome unexpected
meanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Can I doe you any better ſervice, Sir, then in a buſineſſe of this importance? But
ſuppoſe the Barbarian ſhould uſe me with the worſt of his cruelty; ſhall any danger what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
deter me from doing you ſervice? If I die, it is no more then I ought to doe for
you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I can never doe it with more honour then in gaining your liberty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment:
If on the contrary, I ſhould not, I may be upbraided all the dayes of my
life, for loſing ſo faire an opportunity of teſtifying how much I am devoted to you. Doe
not raviſh from me this Glory, I beſeech you, ſir, I aske it in recompence of all the ſervice
I ever did you, and onely require three things from you: The firſt, That if I die, you will
remember, you never had a more faithfull ſervant: Secondly, if I live, that you will give
<hi>Clarina</hi> unto me for my Wife: And laſtly, That when you are got out from hence, you
will make all haſte away that poſſibly you can, leſt you ſhould be taken againe. Thus
continuing his diſcourſe with ſo much urgency, he prevailed ſo far with <hi>Arimant,</hi> as not
to deny him his requeſt, though it was with abundance of ſorrow to leave him in ſo
much danger.</p>
                     <p>Night then being come, <hi>Arimant</hi> entreated the Captaine, as <hi>Bellaris</hi> propoſed, to
give him leave to goe again, who the King knowing would ere long beat Lyons, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to be fingering of the Ranſome as ſoon as he could, whereof he was to receive a

ſend a Letter by him unto <hi>Bellimart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the departure of <hi>Bellaris</hi> was reſolved upon; and the Gate was ordered to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
for him when he would: <hi>Bellaris</hi> informed <hi>Arimant</hi> in all things; to wit, where he
ſhoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> find <hi>Cryſeide;</hi> in what place the Horſes ſtood, and which way he ſhould paſſe;
telling him it was better to go a little about, and go more ſafely. In ſuch diſcourſe as
this, they ſpent a good part of the night; another part in ſhifting habits, and taking or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for all things requiſite; ſo as when it was break of day, after <hi>Arimant</hi> had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
his faithful ſervant with many teares, and recommending himſelfe unto <hi>Mercury,</hi>
he ſet forward towards the Gate in great feare of diſcovery; for though he had the clothes
of <hi>Bellaris,</hi> yet he was not like him, being much bigger, and faces ſo unlike as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
not to know the one from the other, if the leaſt notice was taken; yet he paſſed
without any rub, it being dark, and ſpeciall order being given for it <hi>Bellaris</hi> looked after
him out of his Chamber window, as farre into the plain as his eye could reach, and he
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53527:87"/>
obſerved how <hi>Arimant</hi> looked often back to ſee whether any followed him. At laſt, when
he was out of ſight, then the danger wherein he was, began to preſent it ſelfe before his
eyes, and he thought upon the horrors of death: But neither death nor danger, nor any
thing, could make him repent of what he had done, or be ſorry for it in the leſt manner.
Yet, as every one deſires to prolong his life as much as poſſibly he can; ſo ſoon as he had
got his Maſter away, he would now try what he could doe for himſelfe. He turned the
Doublet and the Stockings of <hi>Arimant</hi> the wrong ſide outward, and ſullied his Hat, ſo
as it had a reſemblance of his own. As fortune was, <hi>Arimant</hi> had left his Cloak behind
him, perhaps on purpoſe to be the lighter: To be briefe, he tricked up himſelfe as well
as he could, and with a confident countenance he went to the Gate and offered to goe
out: The Corporal who commanded there denyed him, ſaying, that one was already
gone out, and he had no command for any more. But <hi>Bellaris</hi> ſhewing him a Letter
which was directed unto <hi>Bellimart,</hi> and the Captaines hand which was known unto all
thoſe at the Gates, they permitted him to paſſe. But firſt, the Corporall who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
in his office, would not ſuffer it without a new command, and therefore ſent him
with a Souldier to know the Captaines will; the Souldier went, but being very early,
and they keeping ſuch a noiſe at the Captaines Chamber door, they awaked him: then
he was very angry with the Corporal for not letting any to paſs who had Letters for him;
ſo the Captaine being angry at his being wakened, he turned about and fell faſt aſleepe
againe.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Bellaris</hi> got out of the Caſtle, and taking his way towards <hi>Gergovia,</hi> he made
as much haſte as if he had wings at his heels: But his Maſter having got the ſtart of him,
and finding out the Inn, he went and knocked at <hi>Cryſeides</hi> Chamber door, who being but
in a ſlumber did preſently hear him, and called upon <hi>Clarina</hi> to ſee who it was: <hi>Clarina</hi>
ſhe aroſe out of bed, put her Petticoat on, and a Mantle over her ſhoulders, and went to
the door with her eyes hardly open. <hi>Bellaris,</hi> ſaid ſhe, thou art welcome, we have long
looked for thee. And <hi>Cryſeide</hi> being very impatient, did ask who it was: It is <hi>Bellaris,</hi>
Madam, ſaid ſhe, let him come in, ſaid <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> perhaps he brings good newes. Yes,
Madam, ſaid <hi>Arimant,</hi> I doe bring you very good newes. <hi>Cryſeide</hi> hearing him, and
knowing his voyce: Oh my good God, ſaid ſhe, and ſtarted up, it is the voyce of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant:</hi>
Then drawing the Curtain, ſhe ſaw him already upon his knees by her beds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ide. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine,
Madam, how this did ſurpriſe her, and how infinitely ſhe was joyed? She caſt her
armes about his neck, and kiſſed him ſo long, as if ſhe intended never to part from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
As for him, he was ſo over-joyed to have his deare <hi>Cryſeide</hi> in his armes, that he
held her ſo cloſe againſt his breaſt, as ſhe was afraid he would have ſtopped her breath:
<hi>Clarina</hi> having ſhut the door, did look upon them, and ſtood immoveable, ſo raviſhed
with admiration, as ſhe knew not whether it was waking or dreaming. After ſhe ſtood
thus like a ſtatue a long while, ſhe went to open the windows, afterwards went to them
againe, and found them ſtill embracing, and her ſelfe as much raviſhed as before: Then
fearing they would even die with over joy, ſhe thought good to part them for a while,
that they might take a little breath; but checking her ſelfe, ſhe let them alone to glut
themſelves with kiſſing and carraſſing; and doubtleſſe they had not ended ſo ſoon, if they
had not heard one knock at the Chamber door. <hi>Clarina</hi> wondred, and could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
who ſhould come ſo early to trouble them. <hi>Arimant</hi> aroſe, and laying his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his ſword, he went to the Chamber door; but never was man ſo ſurpriſed as he; for
he ſaw <hi>Bellaris,</hi> beyond all hope or thought; Oh Heaven my dear friend, ſaid he, Is it
thee? Yes, Sir, ſaid he, the Gods have delivered me, that I may doe ſome ſervice yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
O good Gods, replyed <hi>Arimant,</hi> Can all this good fortune continue; <hi>Cryſeide</hi> at
liberty, I at liberty, <hi>Bellaris</hi> at liberty too? this is happineſſe beyond all hopes. Then
taking him by the hand, he carryed him to <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> related unto her how he had got
him to eſcape, and unto what extream danger he expoſed himſelfe. When ſhe and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>
began to give him thanks, he interrupted them, ſaying; ſpare your words, Sir, I
beſeech you, I am obliged more then ſo to ſerve you: and loſe not your time which is ſo
precious unto you: I am afraid they will follow you, let us pack out of Town and away,
and when we are more at leiſure I ſhall tell you how I eſcaped.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cryſeide</hi> approving of what he ſaid, ſhe dreſſed her ſelfe ſo ſuddainly, that ſhe was at the
ſtairs feet before the Horſes were ready; <hi>Arimant</hi> helped her up, and <hi>Bellaris Clarina;</hi>
and after the reckning of the houſe was diſcharged, <hi>Arimant</hi> took the horſe of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53527:87"/>
ſervant <hi>Bellaris,</hi> and ſo ſetting forward with their Guide, who was already very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
unto <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> by reaſon of her naturall ſweetneſſe, and liberality towards
him, they went a good pace at the firſt; but when they were got a little from the Town,
they went ſlower, becauſe <hi>Bellaris</hi> was on foot; and who by the way, telling them how
he eſcaped, did make them laugh heartily at the extream feares in which he was, when
the Corporall denyed him paſſage, and at his haſte which he made when he was once
out of the Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>Thus they paſſed on the way as pleaſantly as perſons in ſuch conditions poſſibly could;
and being ſtirring betimes in the morning, they went over the great Mountaines of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes;</hi>
&amp; afterwards through the gloomy wood, called <hi>Black-wood,</hi> and came very late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Viveros</hi> ſhunning as much as poſſibly they could all great Towns, and high-wayes,
the better to deceive thoſe who perhaps might follow them: But it hapned unto them,
as unto thoſe who thinking to avoid an ambuſh, doe leave their right way to fall
into it. For the Captain who had <hi>Arimant</hi> in Guard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hearing that he was eſcaped,
took with him ſeven or eight of his men, and reſolved to purſue him, or at the worſt, to
go and acquaint <hi>Bellima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t</hi> with it; becauſe he believed, that doubtleſſe they would goe
to <hi>Lyons,</hi> either to embarque themſelves, or elſe to take the way of <hi>Heluces.</hi> They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Country men, and knowing the ſhorteſt wayes they got before them, and that
night came into the very ſame Inn where <hi>Arimant</hi> and his company were to lodge:
<hi>Bellaris</hi> was alwayes wont to goe a little before and provide lodging and coming into
this Inn, the Captain knew him preſently, and thought <hi>Arimant</hi> not farre of; he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
his men ſlily, thinking to ſurpriſe them both together, which <hi>Bellaris</hi> obſerving,
he ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d for the Maſter of the houſe, and asked whether he had any lodging, and being
anſwered, yes; Well then, ſaid he in a loud voyce, I will go and fetch my Maſter: The
Captain who was in the next Chamber and ready to ſeize upon him, hearing this, would
not diſcover himſelfe, becauſe he would catch them both together; but wary <hi>Bellaris,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
as faſt as he could to his Maſter; Sir, ſaid he, Let us ſave our ſelves as well as we
can, for the Captaine is in the Inn. <hi>Arimant</hi> was extreamly ſurpriſed at this; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
what a ſhort time he had to conſult upon the matter, he thought it beſt that
<hi>Cryſeide</hi> and <hi>Clarina</hi> ſhould go unto the Inn with the guard and invent ſome tale or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to excuſe their journey, and the next morning they ſhould take the way to
<hi>Vienna,</hi> and to know which way they paſſed, they ſhould ſtick a little branch in the way
they took, when they met with ſeverall paths; and thoſe who came firſt to <hi>Vienna,</hi>
ſhould lodge in an Inn next the bridge on the other ſide of the River <hi>Roſne,</hi> and there ſtay
for the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The, would have ſaid more, but they thought they heard Horſes trampling in the
ſtreets, which cauſed <hi>Cryſeide</hi> and <hi>Clarina</hi> with their guide, to put on their Horſes the
one way, and <hi>Arimant</hi> with his faithful ſervant the other: The Cavalier by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the night and the thick wood, did eaſily ſave themſelves; and the third day came
to <hi>Vienna</hi> betimes, where they lodged in the Inne next the Bridge: At night asking newes
of his Hoſt, he heard how King <hi>Gondebunt</hi> was returned from <hi>Gaul Ciſalpine,</hi> loadned
with victory and ſpoil; but at his return had received a very great diſpleaſure, becauſe an

long, glorious, and dangerous voyages, we are advertiſed, that <hi>Cryſeide</hi> one of our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,

Father, and by the majeſty of our Crowne, That whoſoever ſhall bring unto

                     <p>
                        <hi>Arimant</hi> hearing this Proclamation, was in extreame feare leſt <hi>Cryſeide</hi> ſhould be
known as ſhe entred into the Town, eſpecially when the Hoſt continued his diſcourſe, and
told him, that the King had ſent perſons who knows her, unto all Bridges, and advenues
of Towns. This cauſed him to take <hi>Bellaris</hi> apart, and command him to provide mens
habit both for <hi>Cryſeide</hi> and <hi>Clarina</hi> in all poſſible haſte; and as ſoon as they were ready,
to carry them that way they were to come, that they might ſo diſguiſe themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they entred into the Town. <hi>Bellaris</hi> did as he was appointed, and all being ready
he went to meet them. In the mean time <hi>Arimant</hi> furniſhed himſelfe with better Cloaths,
then thoſe he had from <hi>Bellaris.</hi> But fortune who was minded to vex theſe two generous
Lovers yet a little longer, and to have greater teſtimonies of their love and courage, did
ſo contrive the matter, that at the very ſame time <hi>Bellaris</hi> met <hi>Cryſeide;</hi> and when ſhe
thanked the Gods for <hi>Arimants</hi> ſafe arrivall unto <hi>Vienna,</hi> the King <hi>Gondebunt</hi> being hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Hart, he rode cloſe by her, onely with five or ſix who followed him: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he obſerved that as ſoon as ſhe ſpyed him, ſhe retired her ſelfe behinde the next
buſh which ſtood a little out of the way, he followed her onely out of curioſity: But
<hi>Bellaris</hi> knowing him at the very firſt, he clapped himſelfe flat down upon the ground in
a valley, which <hi>Cryſeide</hi> could not doe, nor <hi>Clarina</hi> neither, becauſe they were on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back;
ſo as the King overtaking her, and ſeeing her in the Gauliſh mode, he thought at
the firſt that ſhe was ſome of that Country, who becauſe ſhe would be retired, went out
of the high way: but asking her who ſhe was, and whither ſhe went, as ſoon as ever ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
her mouth, he knew her; for though ſhe had the language of <hi>Gaul</hi> very good, yet
ſhe had the accent and tone of a ſtranger. And looking a little neerly upon her, though
ſhe endeavoured to hide her face all that poſſibly ſhe could; Oh Heavens, ſaid he, it is
<hi>Cryſeide:</hi> Then lighting from his Horſe, he ran to embrace her; How long is it, faire
Ladie, ſaid he unto her, ſince you firſt took this diſguiſe? What good Angel is it that
hath bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ght you again into my hands? and what Devil was it that took you out of
them? Poor <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> more amazed then is imaginable, to ſee her ſelfe in the power of
him whom ſhe moſt feared, and falne from ſuch a height of happineſſe, into ſuch a gulph
of miſery, ſhe ſtood a while and could not anſwer: At the laſt, ſeeing there
was no way to conceal her ſelfe, ſhe reſolved to take heart, and moſt couragiouſly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thus; You ask me, Sir, when I aſſumed this habit and diſguiſe? and I anſwer, ever
ſince Love did command me: And becauſe you call that good Angell who got me
out of your hands, a Devill, I muſt vindicate his honour, and let you know, Sir, that it is
unworthy in ſo great a King, to break both the Lawes of Humanity, and the Lawes of
Chivalry, which commands you to aſſiſt, relieve, and honour Ladies; and not to take
them Priſoners, and keep them againſt their wills. The King hearing the freeneſſe of
<hi>Cryſeides</hi> language, and his love not letting him conſent unto what he knew was the duty
of a Cavalier, he anſwered her; Before any ſhould doe you any wrong, Madam, I will
loſe both my Crown and my life; and in this which I do, I intend it for your good and
advantage, and not to harme or wrong you in the leaſt degree. She would have reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but the King was ſo over-joyed at this happy encounter, and not willing to enter any
further into diſcourſe, he took her Horſe by the bridle, and led him into the high-way,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53527:88"/>
where taking his own Horſe, he returned to <hi>Lyons</hi> preſently, more contented with this prize,
then with all his Victories. When <hi>Cryſeide</hi> was thus taken, <hi>Clarina</hi> could eaſily have
ſaved her ſelfe, if ſhe would as well as the Guid; but having no mind to leave her, ſhe did
follow her voluntarily. Thus was the ſad <hi>Cryſeide</hi> carryed back to <hi>Lyons,</hi> and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt of the Ladies Priſoners, but under a more carefull Guard then before; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the King did really intend to marry her, as well for her beauty, as for her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
to <hi>Rithimers</hi> wife, ſiſter unto the Emperour <hi>Anthemius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and commanded that ſhe
ſhould be waited upon with all ſervice and civility: and his joyes that he had met with
her were ſuch, as he cauſed Bonfires and great Feaſts of rejoycing to be made. In the
mean time, <hi>Bellaris</hi> having eſcaped through Ruſhes and Bogges, he came in a pittifull
fright, to bring this ſaid Newes unto his Maſter, who was ſo much ſurpriſed with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and ſorrow, that he was not able to ſpeak one word; but throwing himſelfe upon his
bed, there he lay till night, and ſay what <hi>Bellaris</hi> could by way of conſolation, he would
not anſwer him: Afterwards, he went into bed, and would not eat nor ſleep all the
night; In the morning he called for <hi>Bellaris,</hi> bad him go unto <hi>Lyons,</hi> and enquire how
<hi>Cryſeide</hi> did, and how they uſed her: This faithfull ſervant, though with much danger
to himſelfe, did as he was commanded; when he came into the Town, he found no
great need of any enquiry; for <hi>Cryſeide</hi> was the talk all the Town over, and the Kings
favours were ſuch, as it was generally believed he would marry her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though ſhe was much
againſt it, for ſome reaſons which yet were unknown unto them. But ſeeing ſo great a
difficulty to ſpeak unto her, he returned to his Maſter, with a reſolution of perſwading
him to retire into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſince it was now not likely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhe who was courted and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by ſo great a King; Ambition to be Queen, would quench all her love to <hi>Arimant:</hi>
Being returned then unto <hi>Vienna,</hi> he related unto him all he heard, afterwards did
ſet before his eyes the levity of Women, their Ambition; the gilded flattery of being
Queen, and the great probability that ſhe would entertaine the honour which the King
did her. He would adviſe him, not to buſie himſelfe any more in the matter, but to
conſider how his Father would grieve for his loſſe: How it might be the cauſe of his
death, and the utter ruine of his houſe; That to ſtay any longer here would not be ſafe,
becauſe their Guid might diſcover him, and cauſe him to be taken: And that for theſe
reaſons, and conſiderations, and many others, it was requiſite he ſhould with all ſpeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to his houſe. <hi>Arimant</hi> did heare <hi>Bellaris</hi> all this while, though his mind was quite
another way. But when he had done; <hi>Bellaris,</hi> anſwered he, I ſhall perhaps follow thy
counſell, after thou haſt done one thing yet more for me: Go againe preſently to <hi>Lyons,</hi>
give this little Book unto <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> procure me an anſwer, and then thou ſhalt ſee what I
will doe. This ſervant infinitely loving his Maſter, did aſſure him he would doe it, elſe
loſe his life; but entreated him that he would not grieve ſo exceſſively; to remember that
his virtue is able to ſurmount the greateſt misfortunes; that he ought to hope ſtill, and
not to ſink under his ſorrows. And <hi>Arimant</hi> promiſing he would take his counſell, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi>
departed with his little Book, in which was a Letter that contained theſe words.</p>

ſubtilty, ſaying unto him as ſhe paſſed by, <hi>I will die firſt:</hi> He underſtood well enough
her meaning; and admiring the love and generoſity of this woman, he returned to his
Maſter, and acquainted him with what ſhe ſaid, as ſhe gave him the Letter, which was ſo
great a conſolation unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> that he almoſt forgot his miſery; Then taking the
Letter, he found theſe words.</p>

                     <p>Well <hi>Bellaris,</hi> ſaid <hi>Arimant,</hi> Canſt thou adviſe me to forſake a woman, who has
theſe reſolutions towards me? I muſt needs confeſſe, Sir, anſwered he, that I doe admire
her: her virtue is above my opinion of her: But good ſir, what doe you intend? and
which way can you relieve her? The Kings power is too great, and his love is too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
to afford any hopes for you? And your danger in ſtaying here is ſo great, as I will give
you for loſt, if you ſtay any longer. Never feare it <hi>Bellaris,</hi> anſwered <hi>Arimant,</hi> I have
thought upon a way to eſcape, and doubtleſſe it will take effect. Then he gave order
for his departure, and the next morning went unto <hi>Lyons,</hi> where he arrived in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when it was dark, and took up the moſt private lodging he could chuſe. There he
heard the continuation of the ſame reports, and more; That the next morning the King
intended to offer a ſacrifice upon the Tombe of the two Lovers, in hopes that they would
mediate for him unto the Great <hi>Tautates,</hi> to change the heart of <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> and move her
to conſent unto his deſires; and for the greater ſolemnity, he would have her preſent with
all the reſt of the Lady Priſoners.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arimant</hi> was very glad of this newes, and thought it a fit opportunity to effectuate his
deſigne, therefore he prepared himſelfe againſt the next morning. In the interim, the King
ſolicited her with all manner of Courtſhip, and uſed all his Rhetorick to perſwade her
unto compliance with him: But ſhe ſtood as conſtant and firme to her reſolution as any
Rock againſt the waves of the Sea, which cannot be moved. And this was the reaſon why,
before he had recourſe unto force, he would ſeek the favour of <hi>Tharamis,</hi> and by ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
obtaine from him ſo much grace, as to change the heart of this generous Maid. When
he entreated her to be preſent, ſhe willingly conſented: For, ſaid ſhe to her ſelfe, if the
God <hi>Tharamis</hi> be a juſt God, he will move the minde of this King, to deſiſt from
any injuſtice.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, when it was time to go unto the Sacrifice, he prepared for her a moſt
glorious Chariot, and conſtrained her to weare the Royall Crown, cauſing all the reſt of
her Companions to wait upon her in great ſtate, as if ſhe were already the <hi>Burgundian</hi>
Queen; thinking to ſhake her conſtancy with ſuch Grandures and Pomp: ſhe appeared
indeed very faire and lovely, and this dreſſe was not a little addition unto her beauty:
but for all that, the inward diſguſt of her ſoule appeared in her face, and all her actions.
The King was ſo much pleaſed to ſee her in this deck, as he did imagine her already his
wife. Thus they paſſed through the Town, and came to the Monument of the two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
where the ſacrifice was to be offered.</p>
                     <p>When they were there; and the King, <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> and all the reſt of the Ladies had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their places; the Sacrifices came, and the Victimaries brought the white Bulls, and
the Prieſts approaching as neare as they could to the Tomb, they commanded the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims
to be killed; when they were opened, and their intralls ſearched, they were found
to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ound and perfect, ſuch as preſaged happineſſe, of which the King was was very glad,
and told <hi>Cryſeide</hi> that it was an evidence the Gods were well pleaſed with their alliance.
She, who till then, had ſome hopes in the juſtice of this unknown God; and now ſeeing
her intent fruſtrated ſhe knew not what to have recourſe unto you but deſpair. In that
reſolution ſhe ſeemed deſirous to ſee the intralls of the Victim her ſelfe, and asked permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to go unto them.</p>
                     <p>The King who was confident in the Reports of the Prieſts, she was very glad ſhe had
ſuch a deſire, thinking that the ſight would make her more inclinable unto him, when ſhe
ſaw the will of the Goddeſſe. So being helped down, ſhe went unto the place of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53527:89"/>
ſeemed very buſie in looking upon the Liver, upon the Heart, and the reſt of the
Noble parts. And whilſt the Sacrificers were all very buſie in ſhewing theſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her, ſhe ſeized upon a Knife yet all bloody, wherewith they killed the Victims: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
running as faſt as ſhe could unto the Tomb of the two Lovers, ſhe laid hold upon
one of the corners, and then lifting up the Knife with a moſt reſolute countenance, ſhe
ſaid aloud, Doſt thou ſee this Knife which I have in my hand, magnanimous Prince? I
will preſently run it into my heart, if any one offer any force unto me; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the point of it againſt her breaſt, ſhe continued thus.</p>
                     <p>The great God of Heaven and Earth be my witneſſe; Oh great and invincible King,
that I do eſteem and admire thy perſon, and all that proceeds from thee: I ſee thou art
favoured by the Gods, loved by thy Subjects, honoured by thy Neighbours, and feared
by the enemies: I acknowledge Prudence in all thy actions, Generoſity in all thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes,
Juſtice towards all in generall, and a particular love towards me, which does not
onely oblige me to admire thee, and ſerve thee as all the reſt of the world doe; but alſo to
eſteeme thee, and love thee as much as poſſibly I can: Knowing therefore all theſe things,
and being ſenſible of the honour you are pleaſed to do unto me in ſuch an advantageous
marriage: It muſt needs be ſomething that has a great power over my affection, and
over my duty, that can divert my will from accepting of it. Would you be pleaſed, Sir,
to conſider this, I ſhould hope for a pardon if I doe any thing that diſpleaſeth you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> for
believe it Sir, could I diſpoſe of my ſelfe, I ſhould be more willing to content you, then
you can be to command me.</p>
                     <p>But be pleaſed to know, Oh great King, that as ſoon as ever I came out of my infancy,
the Gods would have me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> love a Cavalier, I ſay the Gods would have me for had it
not been the will of the Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had not they written it in the unalterable Role of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny,
doubtleſſe this affection would have long ſince withered away with ſo many bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
blaſts and tormenting ſtormes of fortune. Firſt, my Parents, who had power over
me: Next, <hi>Rithimer,</hi> whom you know is puiſſant: and now, you oh great King, would
pull me out of the arms of my Husband: for ſo may I call him unto whom I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
marriage, calling both <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Hymen</hi> for witneſſes of our reciprocal oaths, and
to ſend juſt curſes upon ſuch as break them. If all this be not true, may theſe two faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

of their fidelitity; may they, I ſay, puniſh me with all the rigour of divine juſtice. But if
all I ſay be true then I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e conjure them by that inviolable love they bore unto each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to ſhew their power in thee, oh Great King, by obtaining of the Gods to change and
divert thy mind another way. Be aſſured, oh Great and generous Prince, that this is all
thou canſt obtaine of me, unleſſe by force; which if thou wilt uſe, then this knife ſhall
ſend my ſoule out of my body, and leave nothing in thy power but a cold carcaſſe,
without either life or love. But if thou doſt indeed love me, and art that Great King who
has made all <hi>Italy</hi> to tremble at the very noiſe of thy Arms; make it now appeare, not
onely in ſetting me at liberty, but alſo reſtoring him unto me whoſe I am, and from whom
nothing but death can divorce me: If thou wilt get the name of juſt, thou muſt render
unto every one that which is unjuſtly taken from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf
magnanimous, doe it in ſurmounting thy ſelfe; thy ſelfe, I ſay, who hitherto has been
invincible. If all this thou doſt not doe; then O King, expect the vengeance of the Gods,
who at this very hour doe ſit in Heaven, and ſee how thou wilt carry thy ſelfe in this
action, and will moſt certainly either puniſh or reward thee for it: And you, oh perfect

this day before ſo great an aſſembly, embrace your Tombe in vain, or call upon you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reliefe.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Cryſeide</hi> ended, and embracing the corner of the Sepulchre, ſhe held the knife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her breaſt, ready to ſtrike it to her heart, if ſhe ſaw any offer to pull her from thence.
All the aſſembly were infinitely aſtoniſhed, when they heard and ſaw the reſolution of
this Lady. But the King above all the reſt, was confounded at the Accident. For the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
of theſe two Lovers, was a ſanctuary unto all thoſe who laid hold upon it, and
received any wrong in matters of Love; and was ſo religiouſly obſerved, that neither
Father nor Mother themſelves could recal their own Children, when they held by one of
the corners. The King could not imagine, that <hi>Cryſeid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> ſhould make this uſe of it; or
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53527:90"/>
that being aſtranger, ſhe ſhould ſo much as know or thinke of it. But ſeeing it ſo, he
knew not what to reſolve upon: To let her go at liberty he would not; to violate the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the Sanctuary he durſt not; both out of fear of the Gods, and tumult of the
people. At the laſt, after he had conſidered and debated the matter with himſelfe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to pull her from thence, without any regard either of the place or the aſſembly;
thinking the forces which he had about him, would keep the people within compaſſe;
and as for any offence to the Gods, he hoped to doe well enough with them by Sacrifices,
and hereafter duties.</p>
                     <p>In this reſolution he advanced, thinking himſelfe to go unto her; and ſhe ſeeing him
coming, had given her ſelfe the fatall blow, if the Prieſts had not oppoſed the King; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, That a Prince ſo juſt as he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and one that feared the Gods, ought not to violate
and infringe their franchiſes. But his love which had more ſtrength in him then all theſe
conſiderations, had doubtleſſe driven him beyond his duty, if <hi>Arimant,</hi> who was a
ſpectator, and feared leſt <hi>Cryſeide</hi> ſhould be driven to the extremity, had not preſſed
through the Guards, and ſtepped between <hi>Cryſeide</hi> and the King, and falling down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his knees, ſaid thus unto him; Sir, I come here intrudively, unto your Majeſty, in
full aſſure of your Promiſe and Oath, that I ſhall receive the favour which you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
and proclamed unto him, who ſhall tell you who it was which helped this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Lady to eſcape your Guards. Stranger (ſaid the King) I never will break any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
that I made: declare therefore the man, that I may puniſh him; then ask what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
thou wilt, and obtain it. Sir, ſaid <hi>Arimant</hi> then, and roſe up, The man is in your
preſence, and you may puniſh him when you pleaſe, for it is my ſelfe. This, replyed the
King, is inſolence in the height; and how durſt thou preſent thy ſelfe before my face?
Onely in hopes, Sir, ſaid he, of the favour which I ſhall aske: Never think, Sir, that
it ſhall be my life, or the leſſening of any puniſhment upon my ſelfe, which I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
but that in obſervance of your promiſe unto which you obliged your ſelfe by the
great God whom you adore, by the glorious memory of your Father's ſoul, and by the
Majeſtie of your Crown, you would grant me another favour which I ſhall aske. The
King ſtood amazed at the reſolution of this man, and going back a pace or two: Stranger,
ſaid he unto him, certainly thou art out of thy wits, otherwiſe thou wouldſt never ſpeak
thus; but how wert thou the cauſe of <hi>Cryſeides</hi> eſcape? Sir, replyed he, my name is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimant;</hi>
and I am the happy Cavalier whom this faire one ſayes, ſhe loves: I was taken
Priſoner when ſhe was; I was carryed Priſoner to the Town of <hi>Gergovia,</hi> where I found
meanes to let her heare from me: She who thought me dead, as ſoon as ſhe heard I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
ſhe reſolved to eſcape and come unto the place where I was, and help me out, which
ſhe did accordingly, and was the cauſe of my liberty. You ſee, Sir, how I was the cauſe of her
eſcape, and having declared it unto you, you are obliged to grant me the favour which
you have promiſed. The King, who was on the one ſide aſtoniſhed at his reſolution, and
on the other ſide offended with him, as thinking himſelf ſleighted by this ſtranger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yes,
yes, ſaid he, it is very true, I doe owe thee a favour, aske it therefore, and prepare thy ſelf
to ſuffer the puniſhment of my juſt indignation. Sir, replyed <hi>Arimant,</hi> I never expected
leſſe from ſo great a king as you are: and therefore I doe freely put my ſelfe into your
hands, not fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the favour which I ſhall aske. Ask it then (ſaid the King) and by all the oathes which
I formerly took, I do oblige my ſelfe to grant it. Sir, replyed <hi>Arimant,</hi> then I doe aske
that <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> whom I ſee at the corner of the Tombe, and who is your Priſoner,
may be ſet at liberty, and ſent unto her friends, or whither ſhe ſhall pleaſe, without any
force or compulſion offered unto her. Oh Heavens, ſaid the King, muſt I my ſelfe be the
inſtrument of my own miſery? and having imprudently promiſed, muſt either be perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or elſe be the moſt miſerable Prince that lives? Then ſtanding a while ſilent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inflamed with anger, and aſhamed to be accuſed before all the people of breach of
faith and promiſe; he reſolved to maintain it, but withall, to ſatisfie and vent his anger
upon <hi>Arimant.</hi> And therefore with eyes inflamed with fury; I do declare, ſaid he, that
<hi>Cryſeide</hi> is at liberty; and I do ſtrictly charge upon pain of my great diſpleaſure, that none
whoſoever, doe offer her the leſt violence or injury: vowing by the ſoul of my Father, that
he ſhall never obtain either favour or pardon from me: Then turning towards <hi>Arimant,</hi>
Well ſtranger (ſaid he) art thou contented with me? Yes ſir, anſwered he, the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
man in the world. Then turning towards the Souldiers; Take away (ſaid he)
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53527:90"/>
this ſturdy contemner of my anger, and let him ſuffer torment till he die, that other raſh
men like him, may by his example learne to dread my anger. <hi>Arimant</hi> looked up with a
cheerful aſpect, and obſerving <hi>Cryſeide</hi> to weep: Oh Madam, ſaid he unto her, I beſeech
you let not your teares diſturbe the tranquillity of my ſoul: Alas, my life could never be
better imployed then in procuring your liberty: Liberty? ſaid <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> I value not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
at ſo dear a rate, I had rather ſuffer perpetual impriſonment, then ſee you ſo ruined
in the flower of your age: But go <hi>Arimant,</hi> and if I have my liberty, I will not be long
after you; I will make it appeare, that I can die as well to follow you, as you can to
ſave my honour.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt ſhe was talking thus, and <hi>Arimant</hi> conjuring her to live as long as it ſhould pleaſe
the Gods to prolong her dayes, they had finiſhed the tying of his armes with chaines.
The people were all ſo moved at the conſtancy of the Cavalier at the compaſſion of <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeide,</hi>
as they ſighed and cryed at ſuch a pittifull ſeparation. <hi>Bellimart</hi> who was with
the King at this Sacrifice, and hearing <hi>Arimant</hi> ſpeak, he knew him to be his Priſoner, and
ſo did the Captaine who was come to acquaint him, that he was eſcaped. And ſeeing that
if <hi>Gondebunt</hi> did put him to death he then ſhould loſe all his hopes of any ranſome; he
addreſſed himſelfe to the King, and ſaid; That it was not to thwart the will of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
in any thing, becauſe all he had, his Majeſtie might freely diſpoſe of, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was unwilling to loſe his right; that he beſeeched him to wave the execution of
Death againſt this ſtranger, until he had informed him of his reaſons; and the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
it, he repreſented unto him the great paines he had taken in his ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
he had run, and the wounds he had received: And Sir, ſaid he, the ranſome of this
ſtranger whom I took priſoner who eſcaped from me, was all the reward I ever hoped for:
But if this ſentence of Death be executed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall loſe all my hopes, and all that fortune

King, to beſtow a favour upon him who was ayding and actually aſſiſting in the eſcape of
this Lady: I have ſo, ſaid the King; Then, Sir, ſaid he, I come to inform you of him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom you have juſt cauſe to be angry, and ſeverely to puniſh: for indeed he is in
all the fault, and you cannot in reaſon accuſe this poore Cavalier of any crime; though
it is true, he was a cauſe of her eſcape, becauſe he did not contribute any thing toward it,
farther than that he lived and loved her: I muſt confeſſe that had he not been amongſt the
living, ſhe would not have had any mind to eſcape: But, Sir, is it a crime to live? Did
he ever give her any counſell or adviſe her to it? or did he ever take any paines or induſtry
about it? No, no, Sir, not at all, further then to let her know he was alive. But on the
other ſide, he whom I ſhall diſcover unto you, is onely culpable; he firſt gave the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
he contrived the way; it was he who looſed the Chaine of Boat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

To be briefe, Sir, he did all; and by conſequence deſerves all the puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>The King hearing this ſtranger ſpeak thus; Why, ſaid he, art thou ſo long before thou
nameſt him unto me, that I may ſeverely puniſh him? Sir, ſaid the faithful ſervant, I
ſhall quickly name him, and more then that, I will deliver him into your hands, when
according to your Royal word, you have granted me the favour which I ſhall ask. I doe
promiſe it, ſaid the King, and confirme my promiſe by atteſting all that is ſacred. Then,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53527:91"/>
Sir, ſaid <hi>Bellaris,</hi> the favour which I ask is, That this Cavalier may be ſet at liberty, and
that all his fetters may be charged upon me; for it was I onely, that helped <hi>Cryſeide</hi> to
eſcape: It was I who brought her newes he was alive; It was I that has been with her ever
ſince. To be brief, Sir, It is I onely that deſerves all the puniſhment, becauſe I was, I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that am the cauſe of your high diſpleaſure. But now ſince I have made good what I
have promiſed, it is your part, Oh great King, to make good yours and grant the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
which I asked: I was from my infancy brought up in the houſe of this Noble Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier,
I do owe unto him all that I am; I have been a witneſſe of his affection unto <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeide,</hi>
from the very firſt beginning of it; and I have ſeen ſo much virtue and noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of minde between them, that I thinke the end of my dayes moſt happy, if I can be a
meanes of their long living together by virtue of the favour which I ask; I ſhould think
my ſelfe culpable of ingratitude, if being able to ſave the life and honour of him who gave
me life, and who by his example has taught me all things vertuous and honourable, I
did not freely doe it. And therefore, Great Sir, I deſire you will abſolve <hi>Arimant</hi> from all
kind of puniſhment, and not onely ſet him at liberty, as you have already <hi>Cryſeide;</hi> but
alſo, that you would be pleaſed, out of your incomparable magnanimity, to make them
marry each other, as they are already by the conſent both of themſelves and their Parents.
Let all your anger which you aimed at him, be imployed, good Sir, againſt me, and adde
as many torments as you will, ſo they be ſafe; for the very Glory of doing what I ought
to doe, will make them all ſo ſweet unto me, as I ſhall not reſent the ſharpneſſe of the
paine.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe, Sir, I hear that the valiant <hi>Bellimart</hi> pretends to have ſome right unto my
Maſter, becauſe he was formerly his Priſoner. Give me leave to contradict his pretenſion
in the preſence of your Majeſtie. Firſt, What can he pretend unto my Maſter, but onely
this, that my Maſter gave himſelfe unto him? When you took the Towne of <hi>Cartures,</hi>
Oh great King, <hi>Bellimart</hi> knowes very well how much he is beholding unto this valiant
Cavalier, for his life; I will not repeat it, leſt it ſhould blemiſh ſuch a generous courage
as that of <hi>Bellimart:</hi> But I muſt needs ſay (and he knowes I ſay truly) that it was not
he who took my my Maſter; But my maſter after he had done <hi>Bellimart</hi> a very notable
piece of ſervice, did entreat him to take him as his Priſoner, upon condition to uſe him
like a Cavalier, and a man of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ality: whether this make my Maſter a Priſoner of War,
or a Priſoner of Courteſie, I refer it unto the judgement of your Majeſtie. But to wave
this, and admit him his Priſoner; what is it he would now have? If he was his Priſoner
then, why did he not keep him? Did he let him go upon his Parole? No, Sir, he guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him as well as he could, and he could not keep him. Now if a Priſoner doe eſcape,
and he who had him, do meet him in another Province, can he take him again? No, ſir,
this concerns the grandure of your Majeſtie. I doe not ſay, but that if <hi>Bellimart</hi> had kept
him ſtill his Priſoner within your Dominions, he might now have had ſome Law to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him: But ſince he did not keep him ſafe within your own Realme, but ſent him
into the Country of the <hi>Viſigots;</hi> what reaſon has he to take him againe now, ſince he
eſcaped as for ſafety into your Dominions; and ſo much the rather, becauſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
having made a peace with all the poor people of <hi>Ciſalpine Gaul,</hi> there is no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
that all thoſe who fly hither for refuge, ſhould be ſeized upon as Enemies. This, Sir,
is the laſt ſervice I am like to doe for this noble Cavalier, unto whom I doe owe much
more then I am able to pay.</p>
                     <p>Thus the faithful <hi>Bellaris</hi> ended his ſpeech, which contained in it ſo much affection
and reaſon, that the King could not chuſe but admire the love of <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> the Generoſity
of <hi>Arimant,</hi> and the fidelity of <hi>Bellaris;</hi> in ſo much as he ſtood amazed at them along
while, and began to relent; At laſt he broke out into theſe expreſſions: Great are the
Judgements of <hi>Tautates,</hi> and his wayes are ſo deep, that no mortal man can find the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.
I made choice of this ſacrifice, in hopes of perſwading <hi>Cryſeide</hi> to love me; and on
the contrary, ſhe flyes to the priviledge of the Tomb of the two Lovers, I publiſhed a
Declaration, thinking by promiſes to regain loſt <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> and that Declaration is it
which hath raviſhed her from me, and made me quite loſe her even when ſhe was in my
own hands; and all this to ſhew that all humane wiſdome is but folly, compared to the
infinite wiſdome of that great God whom we adore. And though I do ſee all theſe things
do conduce unto the confuſion of all my deſigns, and plainly foreſee that there is no hopes
for me in the fair <hi>Cryſeide:</hi> yet muſt I needs confeſſe that all things have been alleadged
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53527:91"/>
upon ſuch ſound reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I proteſt that had I known the beginning and progreſſe of this
great and vertuous affection, I would ſooner have dyed then ſuffered it to be ſeparated.
And therefore, oh you happy couple of Lovers, I doe declare you free, and exempt from
all manner of puniſhment or impriſonment, be it either in relation to me or unto <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mart,</hi>
upon thoſe reaſons ſo ſtrongly urged by that faithful ſervant, whoſe offence I doe
alſo moſt freely remit, wiſhing rather ſuch a friend and ſuch a ſervant, then ſuch another
Kingdome as I have; I do give you all three free power and liberty to live in any part of
my Dominions or elſe to go whither you pleaſe; yet if you will afford me ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
as to ſee you married before you depart, I ſhall think both my Kingdom and my
ſelf much honoured and very happy in it.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, he commanded that <hi>Arimant</hi> ſhould be unlooſed, who with the generous
Lady and faithfull Servant, came and caſt themſelves at his feet upon their knees, ſome
kiſſing his hands, others his knees, and all the Aſſembly did commend the Magnanimity
and juſtice of the King, who by the grandure of his courage, knew ſo well how to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Florice</hi> ended the relation of the fortunes of theſe two perfect Lovers, every one
admiring their virtues; ſome did highly eſteeme <hi>Cryſeide</hi> for refuſing the Scepter and
Crown of <hi>Rithimer</hi> and <hi>Gondebunt,</hi> to preſerve her fidelity unto <hi>Arimant:</hi> Others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
the reſolution of <hi>Arimant,</hi> in offering ſo voluntarily to die for the liberty of <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeide,</hi>
but all with one commune conſent commended the fidelity and affection of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris.
Hylas</hi> onely laughed at all three, and at all thoſe who did commend their actions.
Was ever the like folly ſeen? ſaid he. <hi>Cryſeide</hi> like a fool as ſhe was might have beene a
Queen, and now ſhe is onely a ſilly Country wench; <hi>Arimant</hi> alſo, like a fond obſtinate
Coxcombe in his courtſhip of <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> muſt loſe his time, be wounded, taken Priſoner,
and after abundance of perill and trouble, be at laſt like to loſe his life in diſgrace, and
had done ſo if <hi>Gondebunt</hi> had not been more courteous in performing his promiſe, then
he was wiſe in putting him to it: Had it not been better for both parties if <hi>Cryſeide</hi>
had been a Queen, and afterwards given <hi>Arimant</hi> that ſatisfaction he deſired? But <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi>
all their perplexities and miſeries do proceed from that which you call Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
It is that onely which tormented them ſo pittifully; onely that, which had like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o
have coſt them their lives, and made them the ſport of fortune and chance. <hi>Silvander</hi>
hearing himſelfe named, came neerer <hi>Hylas,</hi> and anſwered him thus; All theſe things
which you have named, <hi>Hylas,</hi> are indeed the conſequents of conſtancy which you doe
ſo much condemn; aud how much they are accompanied with paines and dangers, ſo
much more are they to be eſteemed: they are onely generous ſpirits that dare attempt
difficulties to accompliſh their deſigns: They are but ſimple ſoirits, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> who run
after a ſhadow and leave the ſubſtance: <hi>Arimant</hi> is tyed to a thing called Conſtancy very
finely; he muſt ſpend all his youth in the ſervice of <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> and when he is old, then ſhe
will give her ſelf unto him, this is as much as to give a hard bone to knaw upon unto a
Dogge that has no teeth: Had not this Cavalier done better if he had ſtayed in <hi>Eporedes,</hi>
and comforted his poor old Father who loved him, than to break his heart with griefe,
or at leaſt made his old age ſo full of ſorrows and misfortunes, as death was welcome
to him: And then for <hi>Arimants</hi> own proper contentment doe you thinke there was no
women in all the Town but <hi>Cryſeide?</hi> Ah my friend <hi>Silvander,</hi> what groſſe folly is it
to loſe ones time, and ſpend all one has upon one Commodity? had he followed my
Lawes, when he met with ſo many difficulties oppoſing his deſires he would have wiſely
turned his back upon them, and have made his addreſses unto ſome other whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
would have been more eaſie, and perhaps more advantageous: Every one did laugh
at the opinion of <hi>Hylas;</hi> and <hi>Tircis</hi> began then to ſpeak; I perceive, <hi>Hylas,</hi> (ſaid he)
that you are one who will never build any Temple unto Fortune, becauſe you will not
have any thing to doe with her. And I perceive (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that you are one whom
onely thoſe that are old and ugly will adore. And why? ſaid <hi>Tircis:</hi> Becauſe, anſwered
<hi>Hylas,</hi> thoſe who are old &amp; il-favoured, to invite any to love and ſerve them, do propoſe
you as a God: You, I ſay, who are ſo far out of your ſenſes as to love one that is dead.
This, <hi>Hylas,</hi> replyed <hi>Tircis,</hi> is inhumane, to repreſent unto the afflicted the cauſe of their
griefe; but be it ſo, that I ſhould be eſteemed by theſe old ones of whom you ſpeak, and
propoſed as a God, what hurt is it unto me? Is it not better, my friend, to be thought
a God, then to be held for an unconſtant man? And <hi>Hylas,</hi> are not Altars and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53527:92"/>
pleaſing unto the Gods, whom we adore? and why then ſhould they not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men? Do you think, <hi>Tircis,</hi> anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> that I have not as many Altars and
Sacrifices as you? certainly I have; for I can make my ſelf more adoreable then you can:
This onely is the difference, you are the God of the old and ugly, and I the God of the
young and faire: And therefore the ſacrifices which are offered unto you are old and
wrinkled, and mine are young and plump: Unto your Altar comes none but ancient
Matrons, crawling upon Crutches, and crooked, their heads and hands ſhaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;
but unto mine comes none but the faireſt, youngeſt, and jollieſt wenches in all the
Country; ſo as I am then the God of Pleaſure, of Joy and of Life; and you the God of
Envie, Sorrow, and Death. Now tell me, <hi>Tircis,</hi> without p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſſion, which of theſe two
Sacrifices doe you think more agreeable and eſtimable? <hi>Tircis</hi> would have anſwered,
when the venerable <hi>Cryſante</hi> being advertiſed, that <hi>Adamas</hi> with his company would
paſſe by very near her houſe; ſhe came through the wood which joyned to the Meadow
belonging to the Temple of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and by her coming interrupted their diſcourſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Druid advanced to ſalute her, and calling <hi>Alexis,</hi> preſented her as his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The venerable <hi>Cryſante,</hi> kiſſed and embraced her with abundance of joy and ſo did
the reſt of the virgin Druids, much admiring her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eauty and behaviour. In the meane
time, the venerable Druid addreſſing her ſelfe unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> beſeeched them not to think
her ſo uncivil or negligent of her duty, but that ſhe would wait upon them if ſhe could;
yet being commanded by <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>aſis</hi> to wait upon her, ſhe was afraid ſhe could not;
which, ſaid ſhe, does moſt trouble me; for I perceive ſhe will come unto me ſooner then
ſhe thought, by reaſon of this new accident which happened: What Accident? ſaid
<hi>Adamas:</hi> I thought, replyed the venerable <hi>Cryſante,</hi> that you had been acquainted with
it. You muſt know, <hi>Arganteus</hi> was killed in the preſence of <hi>Galathea</hi> and <hi>Polemas,</hi> by
a Cavalier ſtranger, and in the concluſion of the combate one of the Lyons which guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the inchanted Fountain, ſeeking about for food, came upon the place, and ſo affrighted
the Horſes of <hi>Galatheas</hi> Coach, as they ran away, over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the Coach, and broke is
all in pieces; So as ſhe, who by fortune was on foot, to ſee the Combate and part them,
was forced to walk on foot unto Mount <hi>Verdune,</hi> where ſhe ſtayes, expecting her Coach,
and the recovery of the Cavalier who killed <hi>Arganteus,</hi> and I believe is there ſtill. Whilſt
they were thus talking, they were interrupted by the coming of young <hi>Lerindas, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea's</hi>
meſſenger, who addreſſing himſelfe unto the ſage Druid; Father, ſaid he, The
Nimph <hi>Galathea</hi> has ſent me unto you, to let you know that ſhe intends to be preſent at
the ſacrifice which you intend to offer for the Misſletoe; and fearing ſhe ſhould come
too late, ſhe deſires you to ſtay a little, and ſend her word in what place you will
offer it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adamas</hi> hearing this meſſage, was a little ſurprized at it, becauſe remembring that
<hi>Galathea</hi> had formerly ſeen <hi>Celadon</hi> in womans Clothes, and therefore he feared ſhe would
know him now in the habit of a Druid: Yet not to give any notice of his feare, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him thus: Friend, I deſire thee to tell the Nimph, that I ſhould be very willing
to obey her commands, but the time is ſo ſhort now, as I am afraid I ſhall not: For I
know ſhe would not have the ſervice of <hi>Tautates</hi> retarded: all things being in readineſſe,
and the ſhepherds and ſhepherdeſſes aſſembled upon the place, ſo as it is indeed impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to defer until another time, without great diſorder and ſcandall; but if ſhe have a
deſire to ſee theſe faire and diſcreet ſhepherdeſſes, I promiſe to bring them unto her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two or three dayes unto Mount <hi>Verdune:</hi> for I believe ſhe would be at the ſacrifice, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of a deſire to ſee them altogether: I aſſure you Father (ſaid the young <hi>Lerindas</hi>)
you have divined aright; For I have heard her ſay, that ſhe deſires nothing more, then
to ſee whether the ſhepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon</hi> be as faire as they are reported: I thought as
much, replyed <hi>Adamas;</hi> For this Sacrifice which now we are about, is but a private
ſacrifice of a few, and not worthy of her preſence; but the great Day of Solemnity is the
ſixth day of <hi>July,</hi> when I ſhall be happy in her preſence, if ſhe pleaſe to honour us ſo far:
Tell her therefore, <hi>Lerindas,</hi> that the ſhortneſſe of the time, and the little ſolemnity
which is now to be uſed, is not enough to invite her hither, and that I know theſe faire
ſhepherdeſſes will make good my promiſe. I aſſure you, Father, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> none of us
will be againſt whatſoever you ſhall promiſe, eſpecially in paying a duty unto which we
are all obliged: You doe very well (anſwered the meſſenger) to ſpeak for all the reſt;
for I believe that you and <hi>Diana,</hi> are the two whom ſhe deſires moſt to ſee, and you <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea,</hi>

                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Adamas</hi> being deſtrous to know whether all things neceſſary for the

He, and the Vaites, Eubages, Sarronides, and others appointed for the ſacrifice, they
took all thoſe things with which they would ſacrifice. One carried the Gilden Hatchet
wherewith they uſed to cut the Misſletoe: Another, the white ſilken Rope, in which
they tyed it: Another a bundle of Savine: Another, of Vervine; two carried the

                     <p>The place was where the Temple of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was made, by lapping together little trees

was too little to hold ſo great a company: Moreover, the two white Bulls, and the

                     <p>After the Great Druid had ranged every thing in order, and ſaw all the people zealouſly
at their devotion, he cauſed a great Chaffing diſh of coles to be brought, and putting it
on the Altar, he took three leaves of the Misſletoe, as many of Savine, and three branches
of Vervine, and threw them into the fire. Laying his hand upon the Altar, he ſaid
thus:</p>
                     <p>Unto thee, O great <hi>Heſus, Bellinus, Tharamis,</hi> that this people doe render thankes
for the Misſletoe which thou haſt ſent amongſt them; It is unto thee as their onely <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,</hi>
that in this Wood they offer the ſacrifice of Thanks, in this Bread and Wine, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the blood and lives of theſe white Bulls: The one in teſtimony that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it to be from thee, we have the preſervation of our lives: And the other to
ſhew our ſincerity with which we doe adore thee, and conſecrate theſe pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
Victims. As <hi>Heſus,</hi> ſtrengthen the arm of our Cavaliers and Souldiers, and
infuſe ſuch courage into them, as they may be able not only to defend us from our enemies,
but alſo to get the victory over them: As <hi>Bellinus,</hi> be thou the God of men, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them: As <hi>Tharamis,</hi> clenſe and purge us from all our ſinnes: And as our <hi>Tautates,</hi>
be ſtill our onely one God, and look upon us through this Goddeſſe <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> from whom
we hope for all manner of Benediction.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, he threw a little of the Bread and Wine into the fire, and made a figne
to knock down the Victims: Two did receive the blood in Baſons, and two held the
legges of the Bulls leſt they ſhould hurt the Victimaries: Afterwards, the Prieſts cauſing
them to be carried into the ſacred Meadow; they opened them, and ſearched their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralls,
and found them to be very ſound, perfect, and of a good Augury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At which all
being very joyfull and contented, they made the report of it unto the Grand Druid before
all the Aſſembly, he thanked Great <hi>Tautates</hi> for being pleaſed with their ſacrifice of
Thankes, beſeeching him to continue ſtill his favours towards them. Then after a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
the ſacrifice ended, all were full of joy and contentment, and moſt of the old ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
returned to their homes.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Victims being cut in pieces, and the fire having conſumed a part
according to the cuſtome, the reſt was dreſſed and eaten by the Prieſts and other ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds

their company. And becauſe <hi>Daphnide,</hi> who had beene accuſtomed onely unto ſacrifices
after the Roman manner, was very deſirous to know, why they uſed any other ceremonies
in this Country: Madam, ſaid <hi>Adamas</hi> unto her, Though this Country of the <hi>Seguſians</hi>
which we call <hi>Forreſts,</hi> be in extent much leſſe then any Province in <hi>Gaule;</hi> yet the great
God hath had a greater care of it then any other: For to ſay nothing of other, the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo-ligures,</hi>
which is that Country commonly called the Province of the Romans, becauſe
they had a great affinity with the Romans; and the principall Towns are Colonies of
<hi>Focenſes,</hi> and are addicted unto plurality of <hi>Gods,</hi> though at the firſt as <hi>Gaules</hi> they had
the Religion of their Fathers; yet as errors are apt to inſinuate themſelves by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
into all things, they did the ſame amongſt their Ceremonies, and brought into their
ſacrifices the falſe and idolatrous opinions of ſeveral people, and made a Miſcellany of the
<hi>Gaule, Roman,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Religion, and ſo became much corrupted. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
this little Country of Forreſts, never having any communication with ſtrange peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
unleſſe with ſome Romans, have been exceedingly careful to preſerve theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
which you ſee pure and entire as they received them of old from thoſe Ancients, who
after they had long floted upon the waters, brought in that true and pure Religion which
they learned from that great friend of <hi>Tautates,</hi> who with his family ſaved himſelfe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Now this man taught them, that there was but onely one God, whom he called <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,</hi>
whom by ſeverall ſurnames, he ſometimes called <hi>Heſus,</hi> that is to ſay, God om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
and omniſcient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſometimes <hi>Bellinus,</hi> that is to ſay, God and Man, becauſe of
all mortal Creatures man onely does acknowledge him: ſometimes <hi>Thamires,</hi> that is to
ſay, God purging and taking away the ſinnes of the living: and this beliefe has beene
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53527:93"/>
ever preſerved pure amongſt us untill this time: And we may boaſt that we are the onely
people of all the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who have had this happineſſe; for ſome by compulſion, others
voluntarily, and by converſe with the <hi>Romans, Viſigots, Vandalls, Almains, Picts,</hi> and
<hi>Burgundians,</hi> have loſt this purity which we have ſtill retained, both in our beliefe and
practice.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt <hi>Adamas</hi> was thus talking unto <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> diſcovering unto them
the ſecret myſteries of his Religion; <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſhewed unto <hi>Alexis,</hi> the rarities of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which ſhe had ſeen before the ſhepherdeſſe, and yet ſeemed to admire them, eſpecially
when <hi>Phillis</hi> told her, that this Temple was made by an unknown hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that there
was not a ſhepherdeſſe in all the Country who knew him that made it. 'Tis ſtrange, (ſaid
<hi>Alexis</hi>) for it is not the work of one day: and yet, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> none took any notice
of it, untill it was finiſhed as you ſee. But I beſeech you, Madam, ſaid ſhe, tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your opinion doe agree with ours; look well upon the Picture of the Goddeſſe, and
tell me whom you thinke it doth moſt reſemble? It does reſemble, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
ſhepherdeſſe in the world: Then, replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you are not of the opinion of us
all; for theſe ſhepherdeſſes aſſure me, and I thinke they are ſomething in the right, that
this face doth much reſemble mine. Moſt certaine, replyed <hi>Alexis.</hi> For the Picture does
extreamly reſemble you; and yet that doth not at all hinder, but that you are the faireſt
ſhepherdeſſe in the world. I receive this commendations, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> from <hi>Alexis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I deſire to be the more pleaſing unto her, and becauſe ſhe being no ſhepherdeſſe but a
Druid, I doe not any injurie unto her in accepting of it. Though I were a ſhepherdeſſe,
anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> yet you ought to accept it, ſince it is ſo much your due: And though
you refuſe it out of exceſs of modeſty, yet reaſon will force you unto it by the judgement
of all. But faireſt ſhepherdeſſe, let us talk no more of that which cannot be denyed by
any, and let us ſee, I beſeech you, what is upon this Altar, which I think have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
unto you by the <hi>Pans</hi> and <hi>Egypans</hi> of this Country, under the name of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe
<hi>Aſtrea.</hi> The ſhepherdeſs hearing <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſhe thought that ſhe heard the very voice of
<hi>Celadon,</hi> as he was wont to diſcourſe unto her; and ſhe was infinitely joyed at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance,
as ſhe could not hide her joyes from her companions. And at the ſame time
when they came unto the Altar, <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> came alſo having <hi>Daphnis</hi> with them,
who being aſtoniſhed at what her Companions ſaid concerning that place, went along
with them, looking upon all the rarities in it: and by fortune, <hi>Diana</hi> laying her hand
upon one of the little Roles of Paper, of which there were many upon the Altar: ſhe
opened it, and found certaine Verſes in it, and ſhewed them unto <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea.</hi>
Methinks Siſter, ſaid ſhe unto her, that I ſhould know this hand: It is <hi>Celadons,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Phillis,</hi> and I cannot chuſe but be raviſhed with wonder at what I ſee in this place.
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> bluſhed at the name of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> much more, who to diſguiſe it the
better, did ask who this <hi>Celadon</hi> was, of whom they ſpoke; He was, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> one of
the moſt courteous ſhepherds in all this Country, and by unhappy misfortune was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
In what place? ſaid <hi>Alexis:</hi> It was, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> in the fatal River of <hi>Lignon:</hi>
but, ſaid ſhe, let us talk upon ſome other ſubject, and look upon theſe other Roles; Then
taking one which was in the hands of <hi>Daphnis,</hi> ſhe ſaw ſome Verſes which were written
in another Character: for they were written by the Nimph <hi>Leonide,</hi> when not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to perſwade <hi>Celadon</hi> to forſake the melancholly life he led in that place, ſhe did viſit
him almoſt every day; and becauſe ſhe could not conceal her paſſionate affection to him,
ſhe writ thoſe Verſes as a teſtimony of it: When <hi>Phillis</hi> heard the name of <hi>Celadon,</hi>
certainly, ſaid ſhe, this is the place of wonders, for there is no queſtion but every thing
in it relates unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> and yet we all know that he is dead. How do you know that,
ſaid <hi>Alexis:</hi> Nay, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> it is but too true, for I ſaw him die, and ſince have ſeene
his Ghoſt, but I beſeech you let us leave off this diſcourſe: and then offering to go away,
<hi>Diana</hi> ſtayed her, and looked in another Paper which was written in the ſame Characters
the firſt was, and contained theſe words:</p>

to give him place, went all out; though none of the company knew more of them then
<hi>Alexis,</hi> yet ſhe ſeemed as much amazed at theſe things as any, and was as inquiſitive to

more deſire the ſight of me, in being a little deprived of it: That needed not, anſwered

ſtayed here with me, and not have preferred your curioſity of viewing a woody Grove
before your contentment in being with <hi>Hylus.</hi> I had thought, ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi> and ſmiled,
that my ſervant had been more religiouſly devoted unto theſe ſacred Groves, and had
been the firſt that would offer himſelfe at the Altars; ſo as thinking him gone before me,
I went after to ſeek him. You ſaw me when you entred in as I did you, ſaid <hi>Hylas;</hi> and
if your affection to me had been equall unto mine to you, you would have ſtayed behind

Nay, nay, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> this is but an excuſe, you might well ſee that the God of this

uncertaine terms; you muſt either leave <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> or let me take in <hi>Stella,</hi> or elſe break
all off; our Market is quite done, for I am a Merchant at a word; your own law of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
obliges me unto it. Do what <hi>Alexis</hi> could, ſhe could not chuſe but laugh at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of <hi>Hylas,</hi> and ſtaying long before ſhe anſwered; What? ſaid he, are you laughing
in lieu of an anſwer? Truly ſervant (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) I muſt tell you truly, I had rather be
alone, then to have ill company: It is in your choice, Miſtreſſe, replyed <hi>Hylas:</hi> Well ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
ſaid ſhe, ſince I ſee you are a merchant ſo punctuall to your word, I will believe
you are reſolved to quit me: <hi>Stella</hi> hearing her ſelfe named, came in, and knowing that
it was of her whom <hi>Hylas</hi> ſpoke; Madam, ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Alexis,</hi> if you will but pleaſe to
let <hi>Hylas</hi> ſerve me, it will redound unto your advantage; for when he finds my unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
he will more eſteem your merit. Kind ſhepherdeſſe, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> I rather feare
the contrary; for when <hi>Silvander</hi> asked him what faults he found in me, he found ſome,
but in you none. Nay rather, anſwered <hi>Stella,</hi> he found ſo many as he could not name
them all. No, no, (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) Love uſeth to blind the eyes of all thoſe who love well.
Come, come, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> to what purpoſe is all this talk? Miſtreſſe (ſaid he) are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
I pay tell me, for I cannot ſtay any longer. <hi>Alexis,</hi> who began to be weary of
him, becauſe he often interrupted her diſcourſe with <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſhe anſwered thus; Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
we Druids uſe not to be ſo haſty as others; for we uſe to conſult with the Oracle
in all our affaires. But Miſtreſſe, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> do you never any thing without the leave
of the Oracle? Nothing, ſaid ſhe. If as a reward of my ſerving you ſome moneths (ſaid
<hi>Hylas</hi>) I ſhould ask you a kiſſe, would you conſult with the Oracle about it? Servant,
replyed <hi>Alexis</hi> and laughed, we never uſe to aske leave of the Oracle for ſuch things, for
we know that we ought not to do it. How, how, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> not after a long ſervice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
one kiſſe? No, replyed the Druid. What hopes then is there, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
you any longer? The contentment, ſaid ſhe, in loving and ſerving me. Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I take no delight in ſuch a journey, as will not bear its own Charges:
Well Servant, ſaid the Druid, I perceive you intend to leave me, and I will not ſtay you.
Methinks, ſaid he, that ſo many ſervices as you have received from me, may very well
permit me to kiſſe your hand at parting. Although (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) I am very ſorry to
part from you; and though the ſtrict Lawes of the Druids do in ſome ſort forbid it, yet
<hi>Hylas</hi> for a parting blow, I will permit you a kiſs of my hand. Upon this, <hi>Hylas</hi> kneeled
down, and ſaid, I receive this favour in teſtimony that I eſteemed <hi>Alexis</hi> the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the quality of a Druid that ever was; and having kiſſed her hand, he ran to <hi>Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
and taking her hand, Unto you faire ſhepherdeſſe (ſaid he) do I come and offer all
thoſe favours which I obtained from thoſe I loved; and that you may not thinke me very
poor, receive in the firſt place this kiſs which this faire Druid hath given me. If you have
no others, ſaid <hi>Silvander</hi> that are greater then this, I believe, <hi>Hylas,</hi> you have not many
to brag of. Why? anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> Do not you eſteem it a favour which <hi>Alexis</hi> hath
done me? I think it, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> rather a Ranſome then a favour. What Ranſome
doe your mean? (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) I mean (ſaid <hi>Silvander</hi>) that this fair and wiſe Druid, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then be any longer troubled with you did free and ranſome her ſelfe from you, by
permitting you that kiſſe of her hand. I do believe, ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi> that you are much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken:
but I know <hi>Silvander,</hi> that you have been long my enemy, and I will not believe
any thing you ſay, no more then I deſire you ſhould believe any thing I ſay againſt you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But fair ſhepherdeſſe, I beſeech you believe not a word from this ſhepherd, for if you doe,
I am ſure we ſhall not long love each other. <hi>Stella</hi> who was not ignorant of the humour
of <hi>Hylas,</hi> nor much diſpleaſed with it: Now ſervant, ſaid ſhe, I am ſo well acquainted
with <hi>Silvander,</hi> that you need not ſay any more concerning him: But pray tell me? are
you in good earneſt my ſervant? How? replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> Do you think I diſſemble as the
ſhepherds of <hi>Lignon</hi> uſe? No; no, be pleaſed to know that my heart is in my tongue, and
all my words are true: do you not ſee that I have leſt loving <hi>Alexis,</hi> as I told her I would.
I ſhall believe all you have ſaid, replyed the ſhepherdeſſe, and more if need be; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I deſire you would do as much for me in what I ſhall ſay; And to the end we may
live contentedly together, I deſire that Articles of agreement may be drawn betwixt us,
which will oblige us to the obſervance of them, and which we will call the Laws of Love.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53527:95"/>
And for our better remembrance of them, I deſire they may be put in writing, before we
make a full concluſion. My future Miſtreſſe, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> for ſo I will call you untill our
conditions beſet down in black and white; I doe foreſee ſo much contentment in our
future amity, that I will not delay it a jot longer: I think I have an Inkhorn in my
pocket, and as for Paper, I hope to find ſome alſo ſome way or other. All the company
who heard this new way of loving, could not chuſe but laugh, and were ſo deſirous to
ſee the conditions, as they every one began to look for ſome Paper, and a piece being
found, <hi>Hylas</hi> himſelfe would needs be the Secretary; But <hi>Stella</hi> ſaid, that it was more
reaſon it ſhould be ſhe, becauſe it was ſhe that firſt made the Propoſition. At laſt, after
a long diſpute, <hi>Hylas</hi> agreed that ſhe ſhould dictate unto him, and both parties ſhould
conſent unto every Article: But ſtill <hi>Stella</hi> feared that <hi>Hylas</hi> would not ſet down accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to her Dictates, and <hi>Hylas</hi> feared the like of her, ſo as they durſt not truſt each
other.</p>
                     <p>This diſpute could not be without abundance of delight to the company; and becauſe
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſaw her dear Druid laugh heartily at the buſineſſe, ſhe told <hi>Silvander</hi> that he
might do very well to be the Secretary unto them both. I ſhould willingly undertake the
office, fair ſhepherdeſſe (ſaid he) if that true and perfect affection which I beare unto
<hi>Diana,</hi> could ſuffer my hand to write things ſo contrary to the fidelity and purity of my
love; and truly I had rather die, than any ſuch conditions ſhould ever be ſeen under the
hand of <hi>Silvander.</hi> Nay, nay, ſcrupulous Lover, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> never trouble your ſelfe for
an excuſe, I will ſave you the labour of it; For the true love which is to be betwixt this
ſhepherdeſſe and me, cannot endure that any one of ſo different an humour, ſhould
ever be Secretary unto our Ordinances. <hi>Corilas</hi> who heard all this diſcourſe, and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
deſirous to ſee <hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Stella</hi> linked together ſince never two was more like.

liberty; and it would vex me to the ſoul, that a bit of ſcribled Paper ſhould tie me
to alter my way of life, which I ſhould be if I ſhould ſubſribe unto theſe Articles; for
all manner of obligations are conſtraints, unleſſe <hi>Silvanders</hi> condition he included. For

You cannot chuſe, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but be both; for every one ſees you are a witneſſe
of what we have done; and every one hears that we add this thirteenth condition unto

reached unto <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who were talking with <hi>Adamas:</hi> and they out of

of their laughter; he anſwered, that <hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Stella</hi> offered him wrong, which he had
rather ſuffer death than endure. Then he related unto them all the paſſage, and ſhewed
them the writing which was approved of by both ſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I adviſed them, ſaid he, to

object to the contrary: I ſay, anſwered <hi>Silvander</hi> that though I was preſent, yet I would
not be a witneſſe, and in reaſon I ought not to be conſtrained unto it. For is not the
Great <hi>Tautates</hi> witneſſe enough for all, and of all? and yet when any evill act is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
do they uſe him for a witneſs? And why not? ſaid <hi>Hylas;</hi> becauſe, anſwered
<hi>Silvander,</hi> he is to be judge and puniſh all wickedneſſe; and upon the ſame reaſon I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a witneſs. But you, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> are not to be our judge, for we have cauſe enough to
except againſt your judgement. Though I muſt not be your judge, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> yet I
may be your Accuſer, which I cannot be if I am a witneſſe. And as for the ingratitude of
which you ſpeak, it will be much greater, if you ſhould ſo extreamly againſt my will,
publiſh that which I deſire ſhould be concealed; and I ſhould take the very concealment
for a ſufficient recompence. Then the reverend Druid, after he had heard the reaſons on
both ſides, he gave this ſentence. Children, ſaid he, upon ſerious conſideration of your
difference, I conceive that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Corilas,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Stella,</hi> was beyond all meaſure joyfull. Now <hi>Stella,</hi> ſaid he,
thou art fitted in thy humour; and <hi>Hylas</hi> might have, ſearched all the world over, before
he found one ſo fit unto his: I muſt needs acknowledge the heavens moſt juſt in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving

                        <hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Stella</hi> began to love one another in this manner; at the firſt but a little, and
after in jeaſt, but at laſt it grew to be in good earneſt: For <hi>Stella</hi> was a very fine and
pleaſant ſhepherdeſſe, and one of a quick and ſprightly wit: <hi>Hylas</hi> on the other ſide,
was as good and jocund company as could be imagined, and theſe conditions ſo ſutable
both in Servant and Miſtreſſe, that there was nothing diſlikeable in each to the other; ſo
as living together in great freedom, they did by little and little, conceive ſuch affection
the one to the other, as they met not with any that pleaſed them better.</p>
                     <p>But Dinner being ready, and the Table ſpred under a ſhady Tree, as near the Fountain
as the conveniency of the place would permit, all the company ſat down. The Vaices,
Bardes, Sarronides, Eubages, and Druids, did ſit at a Table by themſelves, where they
did eat what was their due of the ſacrifice; But <hi>Adamas,</hi> to render the more honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> did dine with them, and the beſt of the ſhepherdeſſes and
ſhepherds. As long as dinner laſted, the diſcourſe was all upon the Rarities of the place,
and of the ſanctity of that ſacred Grove. But Dinner being done, and the ſun too hot to
ſtir from under the ſhade, <hi>Adamas</hi> thought how to paſſe away the time in the beſt diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and remembring the judgement which <hi>Diana</hi> was to give 'twixt <hi>Silvander</hi> &amp; <hi>Phillis,</hi>
he thought both the time and the occaſion very fit for that purpoſe; and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Daphnide</hi> who ſtayed in the Country onely to be acquainted with the ſweet lives of
theſe ſhepherdeſſes and ſhepherds, would be very glad to hear this difference argued and
what judgement <hi>Diana</hi> would give upon it. He went unto <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
acquainted them with his deſign, he deſired them to joyn with him in obtaining
<hi>Dianas</hi> conſent unto it. Believe it, Sir, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> there will not need much ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
for I know that ſhe has deferred it ſo long, onely becauſe ſhe wanted the preſence
of the Nymph <hi>Leonide,</hi> who ſince ſhe was at the beginning of that conteſt, ſhe thought it
fit ſhe ſhould be alſo at the end of it. I feare, if <hi>Silvander</hi> know of your intention, he will
break off company. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who thought the Druids Propoſition very reaſonable, and
beſides was weary in imploying any time, but in the entertainment of her dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<hi>Licydas,</hi> which was ſomething hindred by her Courtſhip of <hi>Diana.</hi> No, no, ſiſter,
ſaid ſhe, we muſt ſurpriſe our enemy when he leaſt thinks of us; then addreſſing her ſelfe
unto <hi>Diana,</hi> Miſtreſs (ſaid ſhe in a loud voice) This company deſires you would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to come hither, and hearken no longer unto the diſcourſe of him who is talking with
you; for I aſſure my ſelfe, he ſpeaks nothing unto my advantage. <hi>Silvander</hi> was he who
was talking with her in the abſence of <hi>Paris,</hi> when <hi>Phillis</hi> thus interrupted him; at which
being very angry, Oh <hi>Phillis</hi> (ſaid he) you are an evill ſpirit which continually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
me, and at this time interrupts my happineſſe. Your happineſſe, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> will
quickly be at an end, and my ſupream fellcity begin: For, Miſtreſs, (ſaid ſhe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
her ſelfe unto <hi>Diana</hi>) you are entreated by all this good company, to give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the merits of <hi>Silvanders</hi> ſervice and mine. <hi>Diana</hi> was a little ſurpriſed at
this; for though it was her intention to give judgement ere long, yet ſhe did foreſee
that after it, ſhe could not allow any longer of <hi>Silvanders</hi> addreſſes of love unto her.
But the ſurpriſe of the ſhepherd was much greater; for he ſaw there was no poſſibility of
delaying it any longer, and then the fiction of his wager, which was the cloak for his,
reall affection would be taken from him, and he ſhould be no longer permitted to make
his amorous addreſſes unto his adored ſhepherdeſſe. Theſe conſiderations made them both
ſilent for a while, which <hi>Phillis</hi> obſerving; Miſtreſſe, (ſaid ſhe) I beſeech you anſwer
me; I am afraid you are loath to confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that glory upon me by your judgement, which
you cannot deny unto my ſervices: or perhaps you are afraid of loſing that ſhepherd,
and unwilling to be exempt from his importunities. Then <hi>Diana,</hi> left ſhe ſhould let her
diſcontent appear, did ſmile, and anſwer thus; I know not what glory you can pretend
unto by your ſervices, ſince you doe thus publiquely upbraid me with them; nor doe I
know why you ſhould phraſe the ſervices of <hi>Silvander</hi> to be importunities more then
your own, ſince both do proceed from the ſame cauſe. <hi>Silvander</hi> kneeled down, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
thanked <hi>Diana</hi> for that favourable anſwer. Afterwards, riſing up, Miſtreſs, ſaid he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53527:97"/>
unto her, This ſhepherdeſſe not knowing how to love, and finding that the longer ſhe
continues, the more defects ſhe ſhould ſhew in her affection; ſhe would not be put to any
further Teſt of it, but deſires an end of that which ſhe cannot prolong any longer. For,
<hi>Phillis,</hi> ſaid he, and turned towards her, why elſe ſhould you ſpeak thus unto our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe?
Your ſervices wherewith you upbraid her, are ſo ſmall that the reward of them
muſt needs be accordingly; and her feares which you mention of loſing me muſt needs be
leſſe, ſince moſt aſſuredly as long as I live ſhe ſhall never loſe me. Even thus, replyed
<hi>Phillis,</hi> does all faint-hearted Souldiers fly all occaſions of any danger: but I on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
dare look the grimmeſt dangers boldly in the face, and give teſtimony of my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
Why good <hi>Silvander,</hi> do you ſhrink like a coward from the hazard of that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is to be the touch-ſtone of our merits? And what other excuſes than thoſe I
have named, can <hi>Diana</hi> have for her retarding it any longer? I am afraid, anſwered <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
that your ruſtick diſcourſe will be troubleſome to the aſſembly, eſpecially unto the
faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and the valiant <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who being uſed to more high and noble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
will think Country paſtimes very tedious; and becauſe <hi>Diana</hi> would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
her excuſes, No, no, diſcreet ſhepherdeſſe, you are miſtaken, ſaid <hi>Adamas, Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> are now become ſhepherds of <hi>Lignon,</hi> having aſſumed the ſame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
and will conform themſelves unto us; and you muſt thinke, that as they know how
to behave themſelves in their own high qualities; ſo they can as well condeſcend, and
ſuit their minds unto the humble innocency of your lives: and therefore I did make
this Propoſition, to the end that by your judgement, this new ſhepherd and fair ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe
may ſee and learn how to behave themſelves after our Country mode and the
rather, becauſe the Sun does ſhine ſo hot, that we cannot yet go into the great Meadow
where the ſhepherds uſe to perform their accuſtomed exerciſes after the ſacrifice: and
therefore the time cannot be better imployed, then to heare the difference betweene <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi>
and <hi>Phillis</hi> argued and judged. I know, reverend Father, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can proceed from you but what is grounded upon great reaſon, and we are all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
unto whatſoever you ſhall command; and therefore without more adoe, I will doe
whatſoever you ſhall pleaſe; onely I beſeech <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> to look upon the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of our trifles with a favourable eye, and attribute them unto that obedience which
we are all obliged to render both unto you and them. Fair ſhepherdeſs (anſwered <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>)
all that I have hitherto ſeen amongſt you, has filled me with ſo much contentment
and admiration, that you need not doubt but all your paſtimes will be very pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me. Then the Reverend Druid commanded, that ſeats ſhould be ſet in a round circle,
and one higher then the reſt for <hi>Diana,</hi> againſt the back of a Tree, whoſe branches doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſhade
the Circle. And when all were placed according to his deſire, he cauſed three
Garlands to be made of Flowers, and put one upon the head of <hi>Diana<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> another upon the
head of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and the third upon the head of <hi>Silvander;</hi> Afterwards taking <hi>Diana</hi> by
the hand, he placed her in her ſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of Judgement; before her, a little on the right hand, he
placed <hi>Phillis,</hi> and a little on the left hand, <hi>Silvander;</hi> and after ſilence deſired, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Leonide</hi> to make known unto theſe ſtrangers, the beginning of the diſpute betwixt
<hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> to the end they might better judge of the difference: thinking it fit
and reaſonable that <hi>Leonide</hi> ſhould be the relater, becauſe ſhe was partly the cauſe of it.
<hi>Leonide,</hi> who little thought of being more then an Auditor in this aſſembly, was a little
ſurpriſed to ſee her ſelfe an Orator; but in obedience to the Druid ſhe undertook it, and
after ſhe had a little recollected her memory, ſhe turned towards <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and began
thus.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps Madam, you have obſerved, that <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> called <hi>Diana</hi> their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
and have been as officious and ready to ſerve her as ſhepherds could be; I believe
you will think it ſtrange, that ſo fair and amiable a ſhepherdeſs as <hi>Diana</hi> is, ſhould be ſo
free in the entertainment of that ſhepherd: I believe alſo, you wonder that <hi>Phillis</hi> who
is a ſhepherdeſſe, ſhould court her as if ſhe were a ſhepherd, and uſe the ſame expreſſions
and behaviour of a moſt paſſionate lover: for it is not uſual to ſee a woman ſo aſſiduous
and courtly unto another woman. But to ſatisfie your wonder, Madam, be pleaſed to
know, That <hi>Silvander</hi> lived long amongſt theſe fair, young, and lovely ſhepherdeſſes, yet
never was in love with any; inſomuch as he got the Name of the inſenſible ſhepherd. None
of all theſe young beauties having power enough to kindle the leaſt flame in his heart.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53527:98"/>
                        <hi>Phillis</hi> admiring that a ſhepherd ſo young and hanſome, ſhould live ſo long near ſuch
beauties, and never ſhew the leſt ſpark of any heat, ſhe could not chuſe but enter into ſome
interrogatories with him; faigning to believe that the reaſon why he did not undertake
to ſerve ſome one or other, was either want of courage, or elſe conſciouſneſſe of his owne
imperfections and want of merit: And becauſe the ſhepherd whoſe delight was all hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and looking to his flock, maintained the contrary, and ſaid that the reaſon why he
did not love, was onely becauſe he had better imployment. <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and I, being
preſent, we condemned him, to give us ſome good teſtimonie, that the reaſon why he
did not love any, was not as <hi>Phillis</hi> had alleadged: And <hi>Diana</hi> being a ſhepherdeſs both
of beauty and and judgement, fit to judge of his merit, ſhe was propoſed to be as it were
his Miſtreſſe, and he was to court her under that Notion, unleſſe he wanted the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to undertake it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon this he began to ſerve her, and court her as cloſe as if he had
been really in love: <hi>Phillis</hi> was not exempt from the ſame task, ſhe was alſo condemned
to love and ſerve <hi>Diana</hi> with all the paſſion that ſhepherds uſe unto thoſe whom they doe
paſſionately love; and at the end of three moneths <hi>Diana</hi> was to judge which of them
two knew beſt how to love. Ever ſince, there has been ſuch an emulation betwixt this
ſhepherd and that ſhepherdeſſe, that they have neglected no manner of behaviour or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
which could manifeſt a moſt ſervent and real affection: And though the prefixed
term of three moneths be expired, during which time they were to demonſtrate their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
unto <hi>Diana;</hi> yet their addreſſes unto her has continued longer becauſe it was thought
reaſonable, that as I was at the firſt condemnation unto that task, ſo I ſhould be preſent at
the judgement which <hi>Diana</hi> was to give; ſo as it ſeems the heavens did prolong it untill
now, to the end this judgement might be given with more ſolemnity in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>Thus ended the Nymph <hi>Leonide;</hi> and then <hi>Daphnide</hi> began to ſpeak: I muſt needs
confeſſe, ſaid ſhe, and turned towards <hi>Adamas,</hi> that it was not without ſome wonder, I
ſhould ſee <hi>Phillis</hi> court <hi>Diana</hi> with the very expreſſions of a man: But now, changing
my wonder into envy, I muſt needs tell you, Father, That I never did envy the happineſs
of any ſo much as yours; for heaven has exempted you from the inquietudes of wordly
affaires, to live in this ſweet and harmleſs tranquillity. Infinitely happy you are in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:
happy are you in this Country of <hi>Forreſts;</hi> happy in being obeyed and loved
as a great Druid; but much more happy in being ſo near a Neighbour unto the pleaſant
bankes of <hi>Lignon,</hi> which is furniſhed with more accompliſhed ſhepherds and beautifull
ſhepherdeſſes, then ever bore the Name. Madam, anſwered <hi>Adamas,</hi> I acknowledge all
you ſay, and do profeſs, that I would not change my happineſſe with the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
upon earth; having nothing to pray for from the Great <hi>Tautates,</hi> but onely that it
may continue for many yeares. As for the commends you are pleaſed to beſtow upon our
ſhepherds and ſhepherdeſſes, I am aſſured that they will not receive them without bluſhes,
though they will take any thing well which proceeds from you. But Madam (ſaid he)
as you have heard the cauſe of their courtſhip, will it pleaſe you to hear their judgement?
With much contentment, ſaid <hi>Daphnide;</hi> Then the Druid turning towards <hi>Phillis,</hi> It was
you, ſhepherdeſs, (ſaid he) who firſt provoked <hi>Silvander</hi> unto Combate, and therefore
it is reaſon you ſhould alſo be the firſt who ſhall produce your Reaſons and Arguments
why the victory ſhould be yours.</p>

me, from whence proceeds this raſh preſumption? and what pretended reaſons can you
poſſibly have? Thy hopes cannot be grounded upon thy own ſhallow merits, when thou
doſt but look upon the perfections of <hi>Diana;</hi> for they are ſuch as holding no proportion

needs tell thee, that there is nothing in thee which can equall her perfections. How durſt
thou be ſo arrogant and raſh, as dare to love her? But as this is high impudence; yet
methinks that to pretend unto her love againe, is much more extream. But <hi>Silvander,</hi>
what colour canſt thou have for this thy fond pretenſion? what ſhould make thee think
of obtaining her love before me? Thou canſt not deny, but every thing is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to love its like; and I being a woman, as our Miſtreſs is, certainly ſhe muſt needs
naturally love me more then thee. But beſides this; what will cauſe love ſooner then
long acquaintance and continuall converſe? By it, perfections come to be better known;
and by it, merits being better known, love muſt needs take better and deeper root; and
by it, occaſions doe preſent themſelves every minute to render reciprocall amity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voires,

driven to confeſſe that I ought to be loved before thee. But wave all theſe conſiderations
again: can counterfeiting, lying, and diſſembling, ever cauſe love? Do you think that
the faire <hi>Diana</hi> does not know that all thy addreſſes, all thy ſervices, and all that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which thou ſtraineſt thy ſelfe to make appear unto her, is onely in reſpect of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
which is betwixt us? and proceeds only from a deſire thou haſt to overcome me, and
not from her beauty or wit? Methinks I heare the anſwer already, that it is true, and that
this reaſon might not be alleadged againſt me, ſince the wager is reciprocall, and all the
demonſtrations of affection which I make, may have the ſame fault. But ſhepherd, you
are miſtaken, for I loved her long before our conteſt began, and I am ſure ſhe loved me,
which is more then thou canſt ſay, ſince all thou didſt was onely to come amongſt us, and
never look upon ſhepherdeſſe in way of love, nor I believe, hadſt thou ſo much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

know whether ſuch a one as <hi>Diana</hi> lived; or at moſt, had no deeper knowledge of you
then what your name gave him: And yet he can at a minutes warning, be all in a flame,
all affection all love, all yours; will not ſuch folly as this move more laughter then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?
But admit that your beauty has kindled ſome ſparkes of love in him: Is it
not my ſelfe unto whom all the recompence is due? ſince it was onely I that am the cauſe

the wager had never been made; and if it had not, he had never been ſo bold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident

in this main point. But oh my juſt Judge, I beſeech you heare upon what baſis I ground
my juſt pretenſion. It is the propriety of Juſtice, not alone to judge ſtrictly according to
the Lawes which are given us; but alſo, after ſhe has conſidered the true ſtate of every
thing, to eſtabliſh with equity the Law of Nature, which is; that he who does all he
can, is not oblig'd unto any more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though he do not reach ſo high as is neceſſary,
yet is ought not to be imputed a fault in him, but rather attribute it unto the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Nature, who was pleaſed to eſtabliſh it ſo: And he is ſo far from being blameable
for failing in ſuch a caſe, as he is to be much eſteemed, that can arrive at ſo high a point
as no other of his kind can go beyond him, and as very few can arrive at: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faireſt Miſtreſſe, why ſhould I fear to preſent my ſelfe before the Throne of this juſt
<hi>Aſtrea's</hi> friend, although I can never attaine unto that height of perfection which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
in any that pretend unto <hi>Dianas</hi> love; for my affection is arrived to as high a
point, as any other can reach, and higher then any lover will ever attain unto.</p>
                                 <p>Why then, injurious <hi>Phillis,</hi> to fortifie your weak pretenſions, ſhould you without any
reaſon blame me, ſince I cannot love with more adoration then I do: It is not my fault,
but Natures, who gave me no greater capacity, if I do not love her to the height of her
merit: but I cannot complain, ſince the ſame law is common unto all mortals, none being
able to doe it more then my ſelfe: But wiſe nature would have it ſo, and perhaps pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
to manifeſt the high beauty of <hi>Diana,</hi> who conſtraines me to love her, an Act far
above all humane force, or power to doe, and againſt the rule of equality, which <hi>Phillis</hi>
you propoſe to be in them who love.</p>
                                 <p>Then ſhepherdeſſe, were you not jealous of <hi>Dianas</hi> Glory, you would not blame me
for loving her, nor tax me with arrogance, ſince it is the force of her beauty which
conſtraines me, and ſince by this, the grandure of her perfections are more evidently
ſeen. Aks me no more, I beſeech you, how I durſt love her: for though I doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

as it doth often dim the eyes of thoſe who behold it, and makes their deſires go
beyond all reaſon. If then that which is faire and good cannot be ſeen, but it muſt
be loved, and if love be fair and good; why doe you call that Arrogance in me, which is
reaſonable in another? Why ſhould you ſay my pretenſions to obtaine her love, are raſh?
For love being good, and ſhe knowing my love; how can ſhe know it, but ſhe muſt
needs love it? if ſhe did not, it would argue a defect in her judgement which I thinke
none, except your ſelfe, will offer to imagine. Confeſſe therefore, <hi>Phillis</hi> unleſſe you
will extreamly wrong her, that knowing my love, ſhe does love me; and that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
is not ſo nighly impudent, nor I ſuch a deformed monſter, as you would deſcribe
me: If you object, that this does not prove her love unto me, but onely my love unto
her. I anſwer, ſhepherdeſſe, That the love which her beauty produceth in me, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable
accident of my ſoule, ſo as the one cannot ſubſiſt without the other: And
ſhould I ſay, that they are ſo incorporated the one into the other, that my ſoul is this love,
and this love is my ſonle, I ſhould ſpeak a moſt certain truth: For it is not more true,
that I cannot live without this ſoul which gives me life, than it is, that I cannot live
without this love which I bear unto her.</p>
                                 <p>If you reply, That though this ſhould be granted, yet it does not follow that this ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe
ſhould love me, becauſe ſhe has not yet ſeen or known this love in me: I ſhall
anſwer, ſhepherdeſſe, That indeed I doe not believe ſhe knowes yet the grandure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
immenſity wherewith I doe love and adore her, becauſe there are no ſervices nor
demonſtrations ſo great as can ſufficiently illuſtrate it: But yet I am confident, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of herwit cannot chuſe but ſee and obſerve it in part, and that in a great part alſo
and that my actions cannot doe it ſo well as I deſire; yet your own reproaches and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
has ſometimes helped me againſt your knowledge; nay in the preſence of all this
Noble company you told her, that I did preſent my ſelfe before her in raptures of love:
and ſurely the teſtimony of an enemy, when it is to our advantage, is much more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
then the teſtimony of perſons indifferent. So as, faireſt Miſtreſſe, you cannot
doubt of my affection, ſince it is teſtified by one that cannot be ſuſpected of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</p>
                                 <p>But <hi>Phillis,</hi> what ſhallow argument did you uſe in having recourſe unto thoſe favours
which Nature hath beſtowed upon you? ſimply alledging that you being a woman,
therefore ſhe ought to love you before a ſhepherd, thinking that by this quality you have
the advantage of me. But let me tell you, that it is more naturall for a woman to love a
man, then a woman. And if you will but look into the Lawes of Nature, you will find
that it is ſo amongſt all Animalls: Does not the Hen follow the Cock ſooner then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hen: Will not the widdowed Turtle lament her loſſe? Does not all femalls of all
kindes the like? you know this, <hi>Phillis,</hi> as well as I doe; or if you do not, common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
will teach you: Nay, things even inſenſible, doe obſerve the ſame law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
The Palme, will it thrive, unleſſe by another Palme? Will the femall Myrtle live
without the male? Therefore, <hi>Phillis,</hi> It is not by the lawes of Nature, that <hi>Diana</hi>
muſt love you more then me; for if ſhe follow them, they will turne her eyes from any
thoughts of you. But if you will have it ſo, I am content, ſhepherdeſs, that ſhe ſhould love
you as a woman, ſo you will alſo conſent ſhe ſhould love me as a man, and her moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
ſervant. You cannot be againſt this, for as certainly as you are a woman, ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
am I her ſervant: nor is it more naturall for one woman to love another woman,
then it is for every one to love whatſoever loves them: This is the way for us both to
obtaine what we aske: But I ſee now, that you will alter your opinion, and without any
further recourſe unto this naturall amity, which cannot be advantageous to you, you
will fly unto ſuch advantages as proceed from election. You conceive ſhe muſt
love you better than me, becauſe of your more intimate converſe together, which you
ſay does beget a neerer and more mutual affection. But <hi>Phillis,</hi> you may be much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
for by the very ſame reaſon you may perhaps as well me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>t with hatred, as with
love; for by continuall converſation, cloſe and hidden imperfections are better diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53527:100"/>
as well as good qualities: And let me tell you, that being perpetually together,
does oft break off amity as well as augment it: little ſeparations makes love more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent,
continuall preſence is apt to cloy.</p>
                                 <p>I would not urge this point ſo farre, Oh my enemy, did I thinke you could make
any uſe of it to my diſadvantage: But I muſt tell you, that you have done as ill Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
uſe, who in lieu of maintaining their Clients cauſe, doe marre it, and diſcover
the reaſons which make againſt them; otherwiſe could you imagine that continuall
converſation ſhould get you more love, ſince on the contrary, it ſhewes the defects of
your affection which are very great, and of which you cannot deny, but I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
you a hundred times in the preſence of my faireſt Miſtreſs.</p>
                                 <p>But oh my moſt juſt judge and faireſt Miſtreſs, my hope is that you will puniſh her
impudence in pretending unto ſo much of your love, by reaſon of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
converſe, when as it hath onely ſhewed her imperfections: and therefore, <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
the advantage which you get by your intimate converſation, does more hurt then
help you; And indeed your Allegation has much more malice in it then matter, and
all things rightly conſidered, I think my ſelfe more happy in my converſation with her,
then you can be in yours; for your ſtay with her is onely in the day, and that alſo
you imploy much of it out of her preſence, either in the buſineſſe of your houſe and
flock, or other diverſions which ſteal you from her, ſo as you dedicate the leaſt of the
day unto my faireſt Miſtreſs: whereas I on the contrary, what day did ever dawne,
which I ſpent not wholly in her company? When was the night I was not with her, as
long as decency would permit me? Could ever any diverſion draw me from her?
And when any unwilling accident did keep me away, did I not continually think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, and in my heart adore her? Can you ſay, <hi>Phillis,</hi> that you are more with her
then I? Fie, fie, ſhepherdeſſe, never think it, but know, that ſhe is not more with her
ſelfe then I am: for ſhe is ſometimes diverted from her ſelfe by the preſence of other
ſhepherdeſſes, ſometimes by viſits of civility, ſometimes by domeſtique cares, and
ſometimes by croſs accidents, whereas I am continually with her as <hi>Prometheus</hi> upon
his Rock, or rather as the body and ſoul are linked by the ligaments of life: For it
is not more natural for the body to die, as ſoon as the ſoul is ſeparated from it, then it
is for me to die, if I be but one minute ſeparated from my ſweet thoughts of her.</p>
                                 <p>I ſee very well, ſhepherdeſſe, how you laugh to heare me ſay that I am continually
with my Miſtreſs, thinking that it being onely in thought, I am a man much pleaſed
with my own imagination. But <hi>Phillis,</hi> what would you have me doe? I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that if I could be alwayes preſent with her both in thought and body, I ſhould be
more contented: but how ever let me tell you, that as I am, I am more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
with her then you are, ſince when you are preſent with her, your thoughts of her
are farre off, retaining nothing with her but your body which is the inferiour part,
whereas my heart is with her, though my body be diſtant: If you doe object that theſe
imaginary thoughts are not at all ſerviceable unto her, becauſe they are meer fancies,
I muſt anſwer you, ſhepherdeſſe, that it is in thought onely that we adore the
great <hi>Tautates,</hi> and never ſpeak unto him but onely in contemplation. And I doe ſerve
and adore <hi>Diana</hi> upon the earth, as all the world does adore the great <hi>Tautates</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
which is in heart and thought.</p>
                                 <p>You ſee therefore, <hi>Phillis,</hi> how this reaſon argues more for me then you. And as to
that advantage which you ſay your ſex hath over mine, I anſwer thus; That I doe
moſt ingeniouſly confeſſe, that women are really of more merit then men; and doe
come nearer the divine and immortal Intelligences: I do believe that women may well
be ranked amongſt them, and they doe ſo much excell us in perfections, as it is a kinde
of wrong to reckon them amongſt men: we may with reaſon eſteem them the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
betwixt Angels and us, ſince we find by experience, that all the good thoughts
which men have, do take their beginning from them. It is at them they aim, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
themſelves in them; and queſtionleſſe it is by them that we come unto thoſe
pure thoughts; And God hath placed them on earth to draw us unto heaven: For
my part, I do believe it, and will maintaine it unto the end of my life. But this does
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53527:101"/>
not at all argue you, Oh ſhepherdeſſe, to be the better loved by my Miſtreſs: but rather
will produce contrary effects.</p>
                                 <p>I told you before, that when one has done all that nature has given him power to
doe, and hath raiſed himſelfe unto that height to which naturally he may riſe, it is
highly to be eſteemed. And I ſay again, that whoſoever does leſſe then naturally he
may doe, is much to blame, eſpecially when the thing is in it ſelfe laudable, and he
through naturall impuiſſance leaves it undone. Now, ſhepherdeſſe, does not this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
much condemn you, who being born a woman, of a ſex ſo perfect as you hold a
medium betwixt the Angels and us; and yet to love ſo imperfectly as you do, eſpecially a
ſubject ſo full of perfection? I am moſt confident, that <hi>Diana</hi> did never out of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
ſweetneſſe conſider my extream affection, without eſteeming it, nor look upon the
ſhallowneſſe of your Amity without condemning it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For when ſhe found mine ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
ſo pure, ſo entire, and ſo exempt from all exceptions, ſhe could doe no leſſe then
highly commend it, that ſuch a perfect love ſhould be found in ſo imperfect a ſex as
the maſculine. And on the contrary, ſhe is aſhamed that ſo many faults and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
ſhould be found in you and your ſex, which is by nature ſo much above
ours.</p>
                                 <p>But Miſtreſs, let us examine her other reaſons, whereby ſhe argues me ſo guilty in
matter of love. She ſays, that all my demonſtrations of love are onely fictions, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſements,
and diſſimulations; and ſhe thinks ſhe has proved this Calummy very well,
when ſhe ſayes that I began to love you onely upon the wager, and did not love you
before. But I beſeech you, my fair and juſt judge, take notice of the evill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which ſhe drawes from theſe preſuppoſitions: I doe confeſſe, <hi>Phillis,</hi> That the
wager did move me firſt to love <hi>Diana,</hi> and that this wager did give beginning unto my
affection: But muſt it from hence be concluded, that my love is only diſſimulation; or
that becauſe I never loved any before, therefore I do not love <hi>Diana</hi> now? Theſe, ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe,
are abſurd concluſions. If one do run for a wager, and win it, can it be thought
he did run for it in jeſt, and not in good earneſt? Tell me no more my enemy, that my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
paſſions and raptures are but diſguiſements, fictions, and diſſimulations: For it is
true, I did love upon that wager, but it is more true that my affection is moſt real: And I
am not ſo ſure I am <hi>Silvander,</hi> as that I am the moſt real ſervant of the fair <hi>Diana.</hi> What
a ſilly ſyllogiſm is it to ſay, that becauſe I did not once love <hi>Diana,</hi> therefore I doe not
love her now? If ſuch a concluſion may be drawn, then one may ſay, that becauſe <hi>Phillis</hi>
was not in the world forty years ſince, therefore ſhe is not in it now. Had you ſaid, it
was not long ſince this love began, you had ſaid truly, and I would have confeſſed it
with you, with ſorrow that it was no ſooner: But to prove that I doe not love, becauſe
the time was when I did not know her, is as much as if you ſhould ſay, that he who is not
born to day, will never be born.</p>
                                 <p>Now Miſtreſs, be pleaſed to obſerve, how ſhe does contradict her ſelfe; But it is not
ſtrange, for it is the property of lying and calumny to be in ſeverall tales, whereas
truth is alwayes in one and the ſame. But admit, ſaid ſhe, that your beauty did
a little move him, and by this meanes, he is in ſome ſort become yours: Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<hi>Phillis,</hi> you ſhould be ſo long converſant with the fair <hi>Diana,</hi> and know her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
no better? Doe you think it is poſſible to love her but a little? Oh ignorant
<hi>Phillis</hi> in the force of her beauty, not one dart flyes from her faire eye, which does not
reach the heart and wound it mortally. You might well keep your littles for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
beauties, which when they have ſcratched the skin a little, do think they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a great teſtimony of their power; But as for <hi>Diana's</hi> beauty, it ſeems you have not
felt the blowes of it, ſince you can talk ſo of a little. But know, Oh my enemy, that
a Remora which can ſtay a Ship under full ſayle, has not halfe the force of her perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<hi>Diana's</hi> beauty takes not hearts by Littles, but by Alls; and he aſſured that the
Gordian knots are more eaſily diſſolved, then thoſe by which ſhe fetters ſoules. That
fire which our Druids tell us muſt conſume all the Univerſe, has leſſer flames then
thoſe of her fair eyes; ſay not therefore, ignorant ſhepherdeſſe, that one can love her
a little, or that one can be in ſome ſort hers: All thoſe who love her, doe love her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly;
and all thoſe who are hers, are hers entirely; ſo as when you grant that I doe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53527:101"/>
love her a little, you doe grant that I do love her infinitely, and by conſequence that
nothing can equall the grandure of my affection Whereas you, <hi>Phillis,</hi> that can ſpeak
ſo, doe thereby argue your ſelfe incapable of being moved, and is inſenſible of that
which is able to kill others. But I beſeech you, Miſtreſs, ſee what a fine peece of ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
my enemy uſes, to prove that I doe not love you, and to make you deſpiſe my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and judge whether ſhe ever ſo much as heard of ſuch a thing as love? Is ſhe
not very ſubtile in accuſing me, for never loving any but you? and that you were the
firſt that ever fettered me: If this be a crime, I muſt confeſſe I never heard of it before,
and muſt needs acknowledge my ſelfe culpable: for, Miſtreſs, you are not onely the
firſt, and onely one that ever I loved; but more, you muſt alſo be the laſt, and onely one
that ever I will love: And if ever it be otherwiſe, let the Sun cover me with eternal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
let the Earth which nouriſheth me, ſwallow me alive as not worthy to live in
it; Let the Air become my poyſon, and may all the elements become my enemies: and
wiſe men are all miſtaken in their Tenet, that whatſoever has a beginning muſt have an
end: For <hi>Phillis,</hi> this affection which you have ſeene begin, ſhall laſt to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                                 <p>But <hi>Phillis,</hi> I admire you ſhould ſay, that if my affection deſerve any reward, it is all
due unto you: You tell me that you were the cauſe of it, and that all which does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from it, ought to be attributed unto you as the originall cauſe. But ſhepherdeſſe,
take heed, leſt this being granted, it doe not turn to your diſadvantage; for thoſe who
are the cauſe of any evil, deſerve puniſhment: And as you ſay, that my Miſtreſs ought
rather to laugh, then love me; ſo it muſt conſequently follow, that ſhe ought to laugh
at you, and not at <hi>Silvander,</hi> becauſe you attribute all unto your ſelfe.</p>
                                 <p>But <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the doer is to be conſidered: if the intention was good, the evill which inſues
ought not to be laid unto his charge, if he be no other way culpable: but if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was evill, he ought not to have any ſhare in the benefit or glory which ſhall
enſue by it: this being granted, as needs it muſt, let us conſider before we either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
or condemne you, what your intention was when you propounded this wager.
We ſhall not be put unto much pain, Miſtreſs, before we diſcover it: for ſhe her ſelfe
has told us: The fictions, ſaid ſhe, and the diſſimulations once knowne will procure
him hatred: But <hi>Diana</hi> knowes, that all my Courtſhips, and amorous addreſſes unto
her, doe proceed onely from the wager which you made; and if all the conſequents of it
be fictions and diſſimulations, then you are the cauſe of them. You may obſerve, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
how ſhe thought that I would uſe onely fictions and diſſimulations in this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Now ſince it is the Intention which makes the Action either good or bad, have I
not juſt cauſe to ſay, It was you, Oh <hi>Phillis,</hi> who by your diſſembling wager, gave
your ſelfe unto faire <hi>Diana,</hi> but it was my heart which did really give me unto her, by
the knowledge which it had of her perfections, and ſo by conſequence all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which ſuch diſſimulations deſerve, are due unto you; and all the favours which a
reall and unfained affection deſerves, are due unto my heart.</p>
                                 <p>Wiſh me no more to quit the pretended victory unto you, to ſhew my wit and my
judgement; my Wit, in ſo hanſomly diſguiſing a falſe affection under the umbrage of a
reall love; and my Judgement, in acknowledging the advantage which you have over
me: For on the contrary, I ſhould ſhew my ſelf the verieſt fool alive, if I did counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
a love unto her, who deſerves to be perfectly loved above all the world: And I
ſhould ſhew but little judgement, if I did not ſee the advantage which my true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
affection does give me over your faigned follies. I would have you, ſhepherdeſſe,
recant all your reproaches, and be the firſt who ſhall ſay, That there is no affection, be
it never ſo ill begun, either by a wager, or paſtime, but may prove in earneſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
reall, as mine for an example.</p>
                                 <p>But, oh my enemy, all this diſcourſe is but aire, and I believe in vain; for we are
contending with one another for the victory, whilſt whoſoever conquers, perhaps may
not be the couquerer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I make no queſtion, but if either of us doe obtaine the victory
which we pretend unto, that this Chaplet of Flowers at the feet of the faire <hi>Diana</hi>
                                    <pb n="206" facs="tcp:53527:102"/>
will be mine. But alas, <hi>Phillis,</hi> my great feare is, and with abundance of reaſon, that it
will prove to be neither yours nor mine; for all our arguments which we have allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to merit her favour, may be valid as againſt one another, but not at all in relation
to <hi>Diana: Diana,</hi> whoſe tranſcendent perfections and merits is above all the power of
Nature, and therefore will not be ſubſervient unto the lawes of Mortalls. And then,
when we ſay, That love ought to be paid with love; and that long and faithfull lovers
are worthy of reward and acknowledgement; This is right, and good reaſon, as to
men, and does oblige them to follow thoſe precepts, but not at all, <hi>Diana</hi> For ſhe is one
whom heaven has elevated above the degree of mortals, and is equall unto Angels. To
whom then ſhould I addreſſe my ſelfe, unto what ſhould I have recourſe? Shall I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
my ſelfe unto Love, and have recourſe unto Juſtice, by whom all things are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ballanced and recompenced? But alas, Love and Juſtice has nothing to doe with
<hi>Diana,</hi> ſhe is above them all. Addreſs then thy ſelfe <hi>Silvander,</hi> and have recourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her ſelfe; and waving all other powers and reaſons, ſay thus unto her.</p>
                                 <p>Then he kneeled down before <hi>Diana,</hi> and holding up his hands, continued.</p>
                                 <p>Oh <hi>Diana,</hi> the onely honour of her Country, the glory of Men, and the Ornament
of the whole world: Be pleaſed to look upon a ſhepherd here before you, who does
not onely love you, and offer at your feet his ſervice and his life, but does even adore
you, and does ſacrifice his heart and his ſoul unto you in a moſt zealous and devout
manner. As Nature cannot make any thing which can equal you; ſo Love cannot kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
ſo great a flame and perfect affection as can equall your merit. It hath pleaſed the
great <hi>Tautates</hi> to advance you ſo high above all the reſt of his works, as no extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of love, no ſincerity of devotion, can in any reaſon hope for any grace or favour
from you, or that you condeſcend ſo low, as to look at my complaints and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances:
I doe humbly acknowledge, that all human hearts, and all mortall ſervices,
are moſt due unto you, and cannot be denyed you without a ſinne: But alas, we can
merit nothing, all we can do is to love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſerve and adore you, and when all is done, we
cannot claim any reward, becauſe all is but a juſt duty. Under theſe Notions and
Qualifications, I now preſent my ſelfe before you, as before a Deity, not daring to
aske any recompence for all my ſervices, or my affection, for that were a demand too
arrogant, and above my hopes and deſerts: but onely to beſeech you, that you will
be a witneſſe how none knowes better how to love than <hi>Silvander,</hi> nor any that deſerves
to be more loved again.</p>

of departure to draw on, he told her, that it was not to be allowed; ſo that <hi>Diana</hi> after
a pauſe of conſideration, ſhe gave ſentence in theſe words.</p>

having ſeriouſly and deliberately ballanced every thing in an equall ſeale, we doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
and pronounce, That <hi>Phillis</hi> is more amiable then <hi>Silvander,</hi> and that <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

We doe ordain, That <hi>Phillis</hi> ſhall ſit in the ſeat where I am, and that <hi>Silvander</hi>
ſhall kiſs my hand: That <hi>Phillis</hi> ſhall reſtore the Chaplet of Flowers unto <hi>Adamas,</hi>

                     <p>Upon this ſhe roſe up, and took <hi>Phillis</hi> by the hand, cauſing her to reſtore her Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
unto the Druid: And taking up <hi>Silvanders</hi> Garland, ſhe put it upon his head, and
gave him her hand to kiſs as he kneeled; which he received with ſo much contentment
and joy, that the ſhepherdeſſe was well aſſured, it was not a kiſſe which proceeded
from any diſſembled affection.</p>
                     <p>The heat of the day was much abated, when <hi>Diana</hi> gave her judgement; and <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
being deſirous that <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Daphnide</hi> might ſee the exerciſes of the ſhepherds;
he aroſe from his ſeat, which cauſed all the reſt to doe the like, and ſo they parted;
And becauſe <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> did diſpute the matter amongſt themſelves, as que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning
unto whom <hi>Diana</hi> had given the advantage; and the Druid perceiving that the
diſpute was not eaſily determined: he adviſed them to talk of it by the way, becauſe it
would be a good diverſion to make the way ſeem ſhorter. As ſoon as they were ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<hi>Phillis</hi> began to fall upon the ſhepheard: Well, <hi>Silvander</hi> (ſaid ſhe) what doe
you think of <hi>Dianas</hi> judgement? Shepherdeſs, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> I never hoped for
ſo much as our Miſtreſs hath given unto me: And I will maintaine, that never was
judgement pronounced with more equity nor wiſe conſiderations, then this which ſhe
hath given. Why ſhepherd? (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>) doe you thinke that <hi>Diana</hi> has given you
any advantage above me? Whoſoever doubts it, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> does either not
underſtand her judgement, or has no judgement to underſtand. For my part, ſaid <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
I doe not onely underſtand it, but doe admire it; for I do very well underſtand that
I have won the wager, and do admire it, becauſe both parties are pleaſed; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in other caſes, one party complains of injuſtice. In this as in all her other actions,
anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> the admirable wit of <hi>Diana</hi> ſhewes it ſelfe: and yet (ſaid <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>)
It is I that am declared the more amiable; and it is I unto whom <hi>Dianas</hi> ſeat is
given, as unto her who beſt deſerves it; intimating thereby, that it is I unto whom
<hi>Silvander</hi> owes the ſame duties, and honours which our Miſtreſs formerly received
from us. Oh ſhepherdeſſe (ſaid <hi>Silvander</hi>) the myſtery of this judgement is very deep,
and abundance of ſtudy is requiſite to underſtand it: And if our faireſt Miſtreſs
would be pleaſed to conſtitute a Judge to declare her intention in it, I ſhould quickly
make it appear that her judgement is more in my advantage then yours: And if it
pleaſe her to heare us now, you ſhall ſee that it is my part to thank her for the victory
which ſhe has moſt juſtly judged on my ſide. <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> then, There
is no neceſſity of any further explanation, for I think I have declared my ſelfe ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as there is no neceſſity of it. But I beſeech you, ſince now there is no wager betwixt
<hi>Phillis</hi> and you, and ſince I am not now either your Judge or your Miſtreſs, I pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that my name is <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſo let me be called. Theſe words were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſuch a ſerious brow, that <hi>Silvander</hi> ſaw it was her will to have it ſo; yet ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to take it in another manner, he anſwered thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doe know very well, that you are
the faire <hi>Diana,</hi> whom <hi>Phillis</hi> and I have ſerved: I know alſo, that you permitted me
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53527:103"/>
to take you for my Miſtreſs, which I did; and doe you think I am of the humour
of <hi>Hylas?</hi> Pardon me I beſeech you, if I hate inconſtancy, and let me continue as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
for I cannot change; <hi>Hylas,</hi> who did not hate <hi>Silvander;</hi> but though they were
continually in conteſt with one another, yet he thought him the moſt accompliſhed ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
in all the Country. Methinks, fair <hi>Diana,</hi> (ſaid he) that you are obliged by many
reaſons, to like this ſhepherds propoſition, which you cannot deny without offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your own judgement. But if to eaſe you of that labour, you will let me declare
what your intention is in your judgement, I ſhould have quickly condemned <hi>Silvander.</hi>
I perceive, <hi>Hylas,</hi> (anſwered <hi>Diana</hi> and ſmiled) That you would be as good a judge
unto them, as you are a Counſellor unto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, no, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I will not admit of
any partial Judge, and <hi>Silvander</hi> has the ſame reaſon; But if it pleaſe the Reverend
<hi>Adamas</hi> to undertake it, let him ordain and compoſe the matter. No, ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi>
there is no reaſon that any ſhould be judge but <hi>Diana</hi> her ſelfe; but if you pleaſe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
what you thinke conducing to your advantage, we ſhall all give our advice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her. Then, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I doe wonder <hi>Silvander,</hi> you ſhould be ſo prejudicated with
the love of your ſelfe, as not to ſee a thing which is as clear as the Sun: I am confident
that none here but thinks you to be a man of reaſon, and that you doe this onely to
ſhew the ſubtilty of your wit: Could ever any ſpeak more plainly then <hi>Diana</hi> did?
I doe declare, ſaid ſhe, that <hi>Phillis</hi> is more amiable then <hi>Silvander,</hi> and the better to
clear her intention, ſhe added the honour of ſetting me in her own ſeat, to ſhew that
there was as great a difference betwixt you and me, as there is between you and <hi>Diana,</hi>
and that in this regard you ſhould behave your ſelfe unto me with the ſame reſpect and
honour: Could ſhe doe more to ſhew my victory? or declare it in more expreſs words?
on the contrary, in ſaying that thou knoweſt better how to make your ſelfe loved then
I doe; this was as much as if ſhe Irad ſaid, that you are ſuller of ſubtilty and art then
I am, and ſo far I confeſſe it; but whatſoever is amiable in it ſelfe, needs no art or
ſubtilty to make it ſelfe loved. Although ſhe did give you a Garland of Flowers, and
cauſed me to reſtore mine unto him who gave it unto me; yet this was onely to ſhew,
that ſhe ſaw nothing amiable in you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuch things as reſemble flowers which grow
and die in a day. And becauſe ſhe thought my merits more ſolid and durable, ſhe
would not emblem them by things ſo fadeable: And to the end you might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
know it, not being willing any thing ſhould paſſe without recompence; conſider
<hi>Silvander,</hi> what it is which ſhe gave you: and what it is which I receive in recompence
of my ſervice: ſhe permitted you to kiſs her hand, which is a gratification uſed unto
ſlaves, and ſuch as are in little eſteem; but unto me ſhe ſurrendred her place, to ſhew
ſhe thought none more worthy then my ſelfe, and to intimate unto you, that ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
it your duty to doe me the ſame honour which you did unto her. Boaſt then,
<hi>Silvander,</hi> of the advantage which you pretend to receive by the this judgement: Keep
well in memory the great victory which you have this day obtained: Go unto the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the good Goddeſs, and there let it be Chronicled in the Annalls, that future ages
may alſo know it. After this, <hi>Phillis</hi> was ſilent: and when <hi>Silvander</hi> would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>Hylas</hi> prevented him, ſaying; If I were to give my opinion, I ſhould declare
<hi>Phillis</hi> victorious. <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> and ſmiled, you give your judgement with
too much precipitation; for you condemn a man before he be heard; <hi>Silvander</hi> has not
yet ſpoke for himſelfe: 'Tis true, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but all's one, for I know he cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
any thing to the purpoſe. Every one began to laugh at the diſcourſe of <hi>Hylas;</hi>
and when they were all ſilent, <hi>Silvander</hi> began to anſwer thus.</p>

                                 <p>I Have learn'd in the Maſſilian Schools, that <hi>Prometheus</hi> had ſuch a ſubtle wit, as
he mounted up to heaven, and from thence ſtole that Fire from the Gods where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he did animate the Statue which he made; and that for a puniſhment of his
Theft, he was ty'd to a Rock, where an Eagle did continually feed upon his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Shall not I run the ſame Fortune, if in declaring the intentions of the fair <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
I ſhould ſteal from her that ſecret which ſhe would reſerve unto her ſelf; for I
think the Theft not inferiour to that of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> nor that I ſin againſt a leſs Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
But on the other ſide, ſhall I comply with the crime of <hi>Phillis,</hi> who to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
and againſt all equity, and the good judgement of <hi>Diana,</hi> does attribute
unto her ſelf more then is her due? Truly, ſhould I let fall ſo juſt a cauſe, when I am
able to maintain it by clear Reaſons, I ſhall fear my ſelf extremely culpable. What
then wilt thou do <hi>Sylvander?</hi> Canſt thou not do what is fit to be done, unleſs thou
incur a danger? Have recourſe then unto the fair <hi>Diana</hi> her ſelf, and by ſupplications,
ask that by way of gift, which thou may'ſt juſtly ſteal from her. It is unto you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
O faireſt and divine Miſtris, that I addreſs my Prayers; begging leave to declare
the equity of your judgement, and the truth of my Victory; Proteſting, that in this
action I will have a greater regard unto any thing which ſhall concern you, then unto
any thing that ſhall concern my ſelf. For the matter would not concern me ſo much,
though <hi>Phillis</hi> had the advantage of me, becauſe notwithſtanding I ſhould be no leſs
your ſervant then I am; but that <hi>Phillis</hi> by her ſubtle gloſſes ſhould make it thought
that you are the Author of a judgement againſt all manner of Reaſon: This would
wound the honour of your Wit and Judgement. But in a confidence that your ſilence
gives conſent, I will anſwer <hi>Phillis</hi> thus.</p>
                                 <p>It ſeems Shepherdeſs that you have a mind to be twice overcome, and will make me
your ſuperiour by two Judgements; I ſee you would have appealed from <hi>Dianas</hi>
Throne, unto another; and if our prudent <hi>Druide</hi> had not hindred you, perhaps this
injury had been done unto her: But it is no wonder, that ſhe who does not know how
to love, ſhould be ignorant in the ſecrets and ordinances of Love: yet to the end that
neither you, nor thoſe who hear you, may not reſt any longer in that error, hearken
Shepherdeſs unto this Truth, which I ſhall briefly declare unto you.</p>
                                 <p>That great God which is in the higheſt heavens, and who with one ſingle look doth
behold, not only all things which the Sun doth ſhine upon, but alſo all the ſecrets
that are hidden in the Intrals of the Earth, and deepeſt Abyſs of Waters; he was
pleaſed to give this priviledge unto man, that he only can know and underſtand his
mind; and for his further help, he did not endue him with this knowledge, to conceal
it from all, but to communicate and participate this knowledge unto others: And that
he might do it the more intelligibly, he gave unto him two ways whereby he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himſelf; which is, by Speech, and by Actions: And by theſe two every one may
diſcover their intentions, and make them more intelligible unto one another: And
therefore when our Actions are Ambiguous, we add Speech, to make them the more
plain: And when our Speech is obſcure and dubious, we do interpret them by our
Actions. And the great <hi>Tautates</hi> was pleaſed to order it thus, to the end that thoſe
deluding ſpirits which take delight in deceiving all thoſe they have converſe withal, may
be without excuſe, when their decreitfulneſs is diſcovered.</p>
                                 <p>Now the moſt wiſe and juſt <hi>Diana,</hi> being willing to let us know what ſhe
thought of our difference, and to manifeſt her mind more clearly unto us, hath uſed
theſe two ways whereby to expreſs her ſelf. Firſt, She has declared her ſelf in clear
words; and to her words ſhe has added actions, which demonſtratively do ſpeak her
mind: Yet ſince the ignorance of <hi>Phillis</hi> is ſuch, and to leave none in any doubt of
the Truth, I am forced to go a little further, and to ſay, That to diſcover this Truth,
it is requiſite to ſound it to the bottome, and to know who has got the victory by the
judgement of <hi>Diana;</hi> It is neceſſary to conſider the beginning of the Difference, which
cauſed our Wager.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53527:104"/>
The Nymph <hi>Leonide</hi> did very faithfully relate the Truth, when ſhe ſaid, That three
months being expired, <hi>Diana</hi> was to judge whether <hi>Phillis</hi> or I did know better how to
make our ſelves Loved: For our wager was grounded upon the ſaying of <hi>Phillis,</hi> that
the reaſon why I did not attempt to ſerve any of our Shepherdeſſes was, becauſe I was
defective in ſuch things as might procure Love: And becauſe I maintained that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reaſon was want of will, both <hi>Phillis</hi> and I were ordered to ſerve the fair <hi>Diana</hi> three
months; and afterwards ſhe was to judg, which of us two did know better how to make
our ſelves Loved. This being well underſtood, I beleeve there is none here, who does
not plainly ſee, that by the words of the fair <hi>Diana,</hi> I have obtained that which I did
pretend unto: Her words were theſe, We do declare, that <hi>Sylvander</hi> does know how
to make himſelf beloved better then <hi>Phillis:</hi> Could ſhe expreſſe her mind by any
words more intelligibly and cleerly? And yet to leave no ſcruple of any doubt, ſhe has
added actions unto her words; and ſuch as none can conſider, but they muſt preſently
confeſſe my victory. Her Actions were two, Firſt, putting the Crown upon my head,
ſecondly, giving me her hand to kiſſe; both of them are favours ſo high, as hardly any
can be greater: For <hi>Phillis,</hi> Unto whom are Crowns given, but ſuch as overcome?
and unto whom do Miſtreſſes uſe to give their hands to kiſſe, but unto thoſe whom
they think worthy of their Loves? I cannot tell Shepherdeſſe what Country it is, where
the cuſtome is to permit ſuch kiſſes unto their ſlaves, and ſuch as they little eſteem:
but if they uſe to confer ſuch favours upon thoſe whom they diſ-eſteem, what will they
do unto thoſe who are high in their Favours? Believe me, O my enemy, that after
this rate, there are very few, who would not be very glad my Faireſt Miſtreſſe would
deſpiſe them, and I aſſure you, I would be contented to live and die in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem.
And as to what you ſay, That our judge in giving me a Garland of Flowers,
does intimate thereby, that whatſoever is amiable in me, is like thoſe flowers, which
grow and die in a day: I beſeech you conſider what ſhe has added unto thoſe flowers,
as if ſhe did foreſee that this would be objected: We do ordain, ſaid ſhe, that <hi>Sylvander</hi>
ſhall take his chaplet of flowers from my hands, and wear it hereafter, by renewing
it with freſh flowers: Can you think Shepherdeſſe, that ſhe intended it to wither in a
day, ſince ſhe would have me wear it for eternal memory? But in this, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
you are excuſable: For it is one of thoſe miſteries in Love which you do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
and which I will unfold unto you, to the end you may know, why our juſt
judg did ordain, that you ſhould reſtore that Garland which was given unto you, and
why I ſhould wear mine alwaies.</p>
                                 <p>Love, which our ſage <hi>Druides</hi> eſteem to be the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> whom the Doctors
in the Maſſilian Schools do ſay, was the firſt of all the gods who after the Chaos did
ſeparate things mortal from things immortal, and gave them life and perfection. And
becauſe man was only created to know, to love, and to ſerve this great <hi>Tautates,</hi> whom
we were not able to comprehend by any corporeal repreſentations or Ideas, he did ſet
before our eyes a body ſo perfect, as might in ſome ſort repreſent unto us, that which
he would have us know of him: To the end, that knowing him, we might come to
love him, and loving him, to ſerve him. And in as much as nothing is ſo bright and
pure as this great <hi>Tautates,</hi> he created that which he thought moſt pure and perfect,
and did imbelliſh it with all the beauties, and accompliſh it with all the perfections
that a body could be capable of, and called it the Sun. Thus the Sun, appeared pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
from one ſide of Heaven unto the other, gave life and motion unto all that was
upon the earth, and wrought ſuch admirable effects, as many did think it to be the
great God, of whom it was only but an imperfect reſemblance, and did adore it in
lieu of that which it did repreſent. Now <hi>Phillis,</hi> if you would know in ſome ſort what
this great <hi>Tautates</hi> Love is, you muſt learn it by the Sun, and ſuch things as fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our ſenſes: And when you ſee how the Sun gives life unto all that is in the univerſe,
you ought to ſay it your ſelf, that Love gives life unto all ſouls, when it ſhines, not only
in heaven, but alſo throughout all the earth: you muſt acknowledg Love to be the
light, which gives underſtanding unto all ſpirits; for there is none ſo blind, but it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to open his eyes, and make him cleer ſighted. And if this Sun of Love do not
ſhine, then is he all in darkneſſe, without any light or underſtanding: conſider alſo,
how as the Sun does alter and change ſeaſons, Love does the like: It cauſeth the Spring,
by producing in our ſpirits the flowers of hopes; It cauſeth Summer, by giving us the
fruits of thoſe hopes; It cauſeth Autumn, by letting us enjoy them; and it cauſeth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53527:104"/>
Winter, by giving us ſo much underſtanding, as to know how to preſerve them long. I
ſhould be too long if I ſhould relate all the reſemblances betwixt Love and the Sun: Let
it ſuffice Shepherdeſs, that by this reſemblance already inſtanced, you may underſtand,
how theſe flowers, which you ſo much undervalue, &amp; ſay are withered as ſoon as blown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
are the hopes which Love produceth in his Spring: Oh Love! What greater favour
could I receive from my faireſt Miſtreſſe? Oh <hi>Phillis!</hi> how dear and infinitely pleaſing
are theſe flowers unto me? eſpecially when I conſider the conſequents of this favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Theſe fair and ſweet flowers, are the Spring of my hopes; and can you think that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
will not preſently follow after the Spring? Is not that kiſſe of her fair hand
which ſhe was pleaſed to afford me, the fruit of thoſe hopes? Does not this Glorious
Sun of my ſoul, afford me alſo an Autumn and a Winter? Doubtleſſe <hi>Phillis,</hi> my
faireſt Miſtreſſe did not omit them, when ſhe ordained I ſhould wear that Crown of
flowers continually amongſt the Shepherds, and renew it with freſh ones: Is not this
an Autumn and Winter both, ſince I muſt preſerve it long, and renew my happineſſe?
Conſider, O my enemy, how in taking theſe flowers from you, and reſtoring them
unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> ſhe intimates, that you muſt not hope for any thing. And if you have
flattered up your ſelf with any fond hopes, without any ground of reaſon, it is fit you
be deprived of them before all this venerable company.</p>
                                 <p>There remaines nothing now to anſwer; but only to tell you, why my faireſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris
was pleaſed to ſay, that <hi>Phillis</hi> was more amiable then <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and upon what
reaſon ſhe placed you in her own ſeat. For the better underſtanding of it, know Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe;
That whatſoever is good is amiable: but if the good be unknown, it is like
unto a hidden treaſure, which none can eſteem until it be known: when <hi>Diana</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that you were amiable, ſhe did it with good reaſon, for doubtleſs the vertues
which are in you, are good: for reſembling my faireſt Miſtris in ſex, and other gifts of
Nature, there is no doubt but therein you are amiable, and much more then <hi>Sylvander:</hi>
But being deficient in other things which ſhould make you loved, and which ſhe finds
in me, ſhe has declared me to know better how to make my ſelf loved, then you do.
And this Shepherdeſſe, if you do rightly underſtand it, is moſt juſt, and not at all
diſ-advantagious to you: For all three muſt be conſidered; <hi>Diana</hi> is ſhe who was
to receive our ſervices and our paſſions: And you and I were to ſerve and Court her.
It is the property of a man to ſerve and Court a fair Miſtris: I have done according
to the duty and office of a man, in my Courtſhip of <hi>Diana;</hi> and ſhe has done the right
office of a woman, in receiving my ſervices: But it is prepoſterous and abſurd for you,
who are a woman, to Court a woman, and therefore it is not at all ſtrange, that
though you be more amiable, yet <hi>Sylvander</hi> ſhould know how to procure love better
then you, ſince it is his part to court, and yours on the contrary to be courted; and
certainly our juſt Judge did ſo intend it, when ſhe placed you in her room, intimating,
that as it was hers, ſo it was your part, not to ſerve, but to be ſerved. Confeſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Phillis,</hi> that I have won the wager, and I will confeſſe you to be more amiable
then I: And let us both ſay, that never was a more wiſe and juſt Judge, nor a fairer
Miſtris, then <hi>Diana,</hi> whoſe judgement has given me the victory, and whoſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
have made me eternally hers.</p>

                     <p>Thus <hi>Sylvander</hi> ended, leaving every one very well ſatisfied with his reaſons and
modeſty. <hi>Phillis</hi> her ſelf was forced to yeild unto him: and therefore <hi>Diana</hi> ſeeing
there was no need of a ſecond judgement, ſhe ſaid no more. <hi>Hylas</hi> only, who jeared
at all he had ſaid, and held <hi>Stella</hi> under the Arm, ſeeing all was ſilent, he began to
talk. Well <hi>Sylvander,</hi> (ſaid he) To what purpoſe is all this long Diſcourſe? And
what can we learn from it? You may learn (anſwered <hi>Sylvander</hi>) that the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which <hi>Diana</hi> gave upon ſuch ſolid reaſon, had like to have ſuffered the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
by the miſ-interpretation of <hi>Phillis,</hi> that moſt Oracles do receive from thoſe who
will turn them according to their own deſires, and wreſt them ſo, as they ſuit with their
own paſſions. And <hi>Stella</hi> and you may learn, That as there is but one Sun which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
Love, ſo all ought to have but one Love. If it be ſo, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that Love,
like the Sun, gives life, and that none do live without it, and that you never loved any
until of very late, then you have been alive but very lately: And if ſo, good <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
tell me, how you did being dead, to look ſo well to your Flock, to hunt, to talk, to
ſing, to run, and wreſtle? I ſhould be very glad to learn that trick of you, that I may
do the ſame when I am dead; for I have ſeen ſome aſſoon as they are dead, caſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53527:105"/>
into the earth, and there's an end of them; but I muſt confeſs you are the fineſt
dead man that ever I ſaw; and if I could but do as you did before you were in love, I
would not care a ruſh for death. <hi>Sylvander</hi> could not chuſe but laugh at the diſcourſe
of <hi>Hylas;</hi> but by way of anſwer, he ſaid: 'Tis true, that Love is the life of our ſouls,
if it be rightly underſtood; and to that end, you muſt know <hi>Hylas,</hi> that there are
two kinds of life in a ſoul: The one, is that which it lives in the body; and the other,
which it lives with it ſelf. The firſt doth animate the Body, makes it walk, talk, eat,
and do all thoſe things which you knew I did before I had the happineſs to love <hi>Diana.</hi>
And the other gives life unto the Soul, and makes it live in it ſelf: For it enlightens
the Underſtanding, forms the Imagination, and takes up the Will. The firſt kind of
life is common unto man, as unto all other animals; for all living do produce the ſame
actions: But the other ſoaring higher then the Body, does give the Soul another kind
of life, which is common unto thoſe pure thoughts of which we ſpoke before. Now
<hi>Hylas,</hi> when I ſaid that Love gives life unto Souls; I did not then ſay that the Body
was dead, in that ſenſe which you apprehend it; for then I had ſaid things impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Impoſſible, becauſe none can die before he live; and he who never loved, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lived; and he who never lived, cannot die. Ask me no more therefore, how
being dead, I came to talk, ſing, leap, run, and ſuch like; for all thoſe actions do
depend upon a life, which love daigns not to meddle with. Then I perceive (ſaid <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>)
that your love is only in thought and imagination. No queſtion of it (replyed
<hi>Sylvander</hi>) and as for other things, I leave them unto that inſtinct which Nature gives
unto every one. Then (replyed <hi>Hylas</hi>) It is pity but we two ſhould love one Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs;
for we ſhould both agree excellently well: You in the Favours which ſhe ſhould
ſhew you in thought and imagination; and I, in thoſe which your love leaves unto that
inſtinct of Nature. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and moſt of the Shepherds, did laugh heartily at the
merry humour of <hi>Hylas;</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who at laſt returned him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
Ah <hi>Hylas,</hi> Did you know how to Love, you would not ſpeak thus, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
things as you do. Though my Soul doth live in its own thoughts, yet for all
that, it gives life unto that body which it animates: The Sun, which as I told you, is
the true Embleme of Love, though it do ſhine upon Celeſtial things, yet it does alſo
caſt his rayes upon Bodies here below: And why ſhould not Love, which enlightens
our Underſtanding, and forms the thoughts of our ſouls, give ſuch deſires alſo unto
our Bodies, as are natural unto it? No, no <hi>Hylas,</hi> here lies all the difference; Thoſe
who love as I do, they have none of thoſe deſires whereof you ſpeak, but becauſe they
love: And thoſe who love as you do, do not love, but becauſe they have thoſe deſires.
But <hi>Sylvander</hi> (ſaid <hi>Stella,</hi> who was a little netled at this diſcourſe) ſince you have
theſe deſires, Are you not very bold, when you conſider who you are, and who <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
is? I muſt needs confeſs, anſwered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> That when I do look upon my ſelf
with eyes of equality, I think you are in the right; but when I conſider my extream
love, and the hopes which ſhe was pleaſed to give me, I think my ſelf not too blame.
Your extream love (ſaid ſhe) and your hopes alſo, are things inviſible. But the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of my faireſt Miſtris (anſwered <hi>Sylvander</hi>) may make them viſible: And though
mine have not hitherto been ſo great as to demonſtrate them, yet I hope to render her
ſuch ſervice, as ſhall evidence it to her, and all the world, that my Love is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
that ever was. But had you obſerved her actions as well as I, you would not have
upbraided me with my hopes, as you have done: For is not every flower a hope? And
to what purpoſe do you think ſhe ordained I ſhould wear them upon my head? It is
true replied <hi>Stella;</hi> but as you received thoſe flowers from the ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> ſo you
muſt expect your hopes from him, and not from <hi>Diana.</hi> O <hi>Stella,</hi> ſaid <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I
perceive your eye was only upon <hi>Hylas:</hi> for had you looked about you, you might
have ſeen, I had them not from that <hi>Druide:</hi> It is true, I had them firſt from him,
but I laid them at the feet of <hi>Diana;</hi> to ſhew, that from her I expected all my hopes:
and now you ſee them upon my head, from what other hand do you think I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, but from hers, upon whom all my hopes depend? Did I not receive this
Crown of Flowers from her fair hand? And did ſhe not thereby as much as ſay, HOPE?
But yet, replied <hi>Stella,</hi> theſe flowers, and theſe hopes, did come from the ſage <hi>Adamas:</hi>
This, anſwered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> is not without a deep miſtery, for perhaps the great <hi>Tauta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi>
would have me know, that the beginning of all my hopes muſt take original from
ſage <hi>Adamas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53527:105"/>
The diſpute betwixt theſe Shepherds, and Shepherdeſſes had continued longer, had
they not come at the ſame time unto the great Meddow, where the Shepherds uſed to
perform their exerciſes. A great company was already aſſembled from all parts, and
were prepared with all things neceſſary, when ſeing the grand <hi>Druide</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a far off, they came to meet him, with many demonſtrations of joy, to have him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. After the Complements of Courteſie were performed, the Prizes were
ſet up, for Running, for Wreſtling, for Leaping, and for throwing the Bar: <hi>Sylvander</hi>
had the honour of the firſt, <hi>Lycidas</hi> of wreſtling, <hi>Hylas</hi> of leaping, and <hi>Hermantes</hi> of
throwing the bar: As for <hi>Sylvander,</hi> every one was glad of his victory, and of that
of <hi>Lycidas</hi> alſo; but as for <hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Hermantes,</hi> who came with <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
the Shepherds of Forreſts did a little grudge at them: and <hi>Hylas</hi> going unto <hi>Stella,</hi>
becauſe the prize which he had won, was a little Crown compoſed of Feathers; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched
her to let him put it upon her head; <hi>Sylvander</hi> ſeeing this, by way of mockery,
ſaid unto him, That, <hi>Hylas,</hi> is a very right reward for thy faithful paines. What do you
ſay? (ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> after he had put the Crown upon the head of <hi>Stella</hi>) I ſay (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Sylvander</hi>) that thoſe who know you, and dare leap with you, are very bold; for
having ſuch a light head as you have, they might eaſily imagine your heels like unto
it, and be out of hopes to overcome you: but they who made that Crown, ſhewed
more judgement, for nothing could ſute ſo well to your light mind, as a Cap of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
I am not at all aſhamed of it, anſwered <hi>Hylas;</hi> for unto you who are lumpiſh
and dull, they did very well to give ſuch things as the groſs earth produceth, as that
Garland of Flowers, which you have in your hand: But unto me, as unto one who is
compoſed of a more noble temper, they have preſented Feathers, to ſhew, that I do
elevate my ſelf in the Element of Ayr; as deſpiſing ſuch a lumpiſh piece as you are;
you I ſay, who does envy that which you upbraid me withal: ſince I will run againſt all
the reſt of the Shepherds, to get the glory of being lighter then they. You are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
(anſwered <hi>Sylvander</hi>) I did not run, to make it appear I was lighter; but becauſe I
was deſirous to be the firſt at my faireſt Miſtris, who ſat at the end of the Race: ſo as
you are deceived, if you thought I did run for the honour of running beſt: for my
aym was only to make it appear, that none could go before me, when I was going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her. By Fortune <hi>Diana</hi> was ſo neer, as ſhe heard all the diſcourſe, and therefore
addreſſing her ſelf unto <hi>Sylvander;</hi> Shepherd, ſaid ſhe unto him, theſe names of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris,
and Faireſt, and theſe expreſſions of a particular affection, were in ſeaſon as long
as the wager laſted; but now, let me entreat you to uſe them no more, unleſſe you
will diſ-oblige me: but remember that my name is <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſo, I pray, let me be
called. <hi>Sylvander</hi> anſwered, That he who deſired life no longer then to do her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
had rather die then diſpleaſe her: but I beſeech you, (ſaid he) allow me the reſt
of the day to unaccuſtome my tongue, before you lay this command upon me; and
in the mean time, I moſt humbly beſeech you, to accept of this Crown which I have
won, to the end I may put this day in the Calender, as the happieſt I ever yet lived.
The Shepherdeſſe who did love this Shepherd, and began to reſign that place in her
heart which <hi>Philander</hi> had, ſhe was inclinable to grant his requeſt: but fearing leſt her
good will would too much appear, ſhe refuſed it, and had gone away, if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and
<hi>Alexis</hi> had not ſtayed her; telling her, that <hi>Sylvanders</hi> requeſt was ſo reaſonable,
that ſhe would offend her own Natural Courteſie, if ſhe did refuſe it: and almoſt by
force, at leaſt in appearance, made her conſent unto it. I wiſh, ſaid the Nimph <hi>Leonide,</hi>
that this Chaplet of Flowers, which <hi>Diana</hi> wears upon her head, were given unto <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi>
for otherwiſe, it will grieve him at the heart, to ſee <hi>Sylvander's</hi> Garland upon the
head of his Miſtris. That Title Madam (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) is not my due: but however, I
ſhall conſent unto whatſoever the Nimph <hi>Leonide</hi> ſhall think fit: upon this, taking off
the Chaplet of Flowers which ſhe wore upon her own head, and receiving that which
<hi>Sylvander</hi> preſented unto her, ſhe ſet her own upon the head of <hi>Paris,</hi> and put <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanders</hi>
upon her own head: This cauſed no ſmall diſpute between <hi>Paris,</hi> and that
Shepherd, to know which of them was moſt favoured; but for that time they ſaid no
more: becauſe the Sun was very low, which cauſed them to retire homewards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> walked together: <hi>Adamas, Alcidon,</hi> and <hi>Daphnide,</hi> kept toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>Phillis</hi> was with <hi>Lycidas;</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> entertained <hi>Leonide</hi> with the diſcourſe
which ſhe formerly begun in the houſe of <hi>Adams;</hi> ſo as <hi>Sylvander</hi> addreſſed himſelf
with all humility unto <hi>Diana:</hi> Faireſt Miſtris (ſaid he) will you permit me to wait
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53527:106"/>
upon you unto your Houſe? <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I accept of your curteſie; But I
would gladly have you accuſtome your ſelf betimes to call me by my name. Believe it
fair Shepherdeſs (anſwered he) you have no truer Name, then that, when I call you
Miſtris. For I moſt earneſtly beſeech you to believe, there is nothing under the Sun more
certain, then that I am your ſervant. <hi>Diana</hi> who had no mind to be quit of <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
though ſhe ſaw that ſhe had no reaſon to love him, being but a poor unknown ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
ſhe was at a ſtand what to do; but thinking that then there was no better way then
to ſeem contented he ſhould behave himſelf the reſt of the day as he deſired, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him thus; I am contented <hi>Sylvander</hi> you ſhould end the remainder of
the day, as you began it, ſince <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> would have it ſo. If I thought
(anſwered he) that when this day is ended, I ſhould have done loving you; I
vow by him that gave me life, I would not live it out. You are permitted (replied
<hi>Diana</hi>) to continue on your way of behaviour, as long as the day laſts; but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the Sun is going to ſet, and that then the day ends. The day (anſwered <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi>)
doth laſt as long as there is any light. I confeſs it, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> and
therefore within an hour after the Sun is ſet, there will be no light, nor by conſequence,
any day to continue the behaviour which your Wager permitted you. Give me leave
to tell you, Faireſt Miſtris, ſaid he, That no time can limit the ſervice which I owe you,
nor any forbiddance has power to divert me from that real Affection, which I have
vowed unto you: And faireſt Shepherdeſs, Let me further tell you in words of Truth,
That this Wager firſt began without any other Deſign then to conquer <hi>Phillis,</hi> and for
paſtime unto the company; But ſince, thoſe perfections which I have found in you, have
made it appear, that there is no jeſting with Love; and that it is impoſſible to be long
neer a great fire, and not be burned. <hi>Sylvander</hi> (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) If you do intend I ſhould
believe theſe words, I muſt anſwer you, That I am ſo much diſ-obliged by you, as I
cannot tell whether I ſhall ever forget the wrong, if I did not think you intend to cloſe
the day according to your Wager: I ſhall yet receive all you ſay, as I have done, ſince
the difference betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and you began: But when the day is done, Take heed
how you anſwer me, that I may know what to do; And I heartily entreat you to think
well upon it. <hi>Sylvander</hi> ſeeing <hi>Diana</hi> more in earneſt then he imagined, and fearing
that if he went any further, ſhe ſhould for ever baniſh him; he reſolved to incenſe her
no farther, but to refer it unto time, which by his long ſervices might have better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon her; hoping, that perhaps ſhe might be glad of the like occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his Services, and aſſurances of his Affection, under the ſame cover which ſhe
now received them: and therefore looking her full in the face, Faireſt Miſtris, ſaid he,
The day is not yet done; and when it is, I ſhall be-think my ſelf how to anſwer you;
In the mean time, give me leave to uſe the priviledge which you granted me. Upon
that account (anſwered <hi>Diana</hi>) I ſhall moſt willingly entertain your Diſcourſe; But
me-thinks you ſhould begin now to talk as you muſt then; for you ſee the Sun is almoſt
ſet. It is long, Miſtris, anſwered he, before you and I ſhall come to an accompt;
ſince the day you have granted me muſt laſt as long as I live. As you live! replyed
<hi>Diana,</hi> I ſhou'd be ſorry your life ſhould be ſo ſhort; and am ſo much obliged unto
you, as to wiſh it may laſt long. Will you be pleaſed, Faireſt Miſtris, ſaid he, that
we make choiſe of one to regulate this matter betwixt us? Who would you chuſe?
anſwered <hi>Diana.</hi> Whom you ſhall pleaſe, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſo it be one that ever in
their life loved. Shall we refer it, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> unto <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis?</hi> With all my
heart, anſwered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> though I know <hi>Phillis</hi> to be my enemy. You are miſtaken,
anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſmil'd; for however ſhe ſeems the contrary, yet there is not one
Spepherdeſs that takes your part more really then ſhe: But I would not have our diſpute
to be made a publique buſineſs, as that was betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and you; for ſeveral conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:
Let it be this night, when every one is retired, for we all ſup this night at
<hi>Aſtreas</hi> houſe, where <hi>Phocion</hi> does treat <hi>Adamas,</hi> and <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and us all; and there
we may talk as privately as we pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Oh, what conſolation were theſe words unto <hi>Sylvander!</hi> For <hi>Dianas</hi> deſire of ſecrecy
was an argument unto him, that his buſineſs was upon good terms: And the truth is,
The good will of this Shepherdeſs was by degrees more and more inclinable unto <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander;</hi>
ſo as though ſhe knew not well what to do, yet it was impoſſible for her to
diſ-ingage her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Aſrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> went talking together; and as it is uſual in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53527:106"/>
Diſcourſe, to paſs from one ſubject unto another; they fell at laſt upon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Diana.</hi> Fair Shepherdeſs, (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi> unto <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) Shall I ſpeak my mind
freely unto you? As unto your ſelf, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Then, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> What do
you think of <hi>Sylvander</hi>'s love? I think, anſwered ſhe, that this Shepherd is very deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in love, and that if <hi>Diana</hi> did not carry her ſelf very prudently, I ſhould fear ſhe
does not diſlike of it. For my part, replied the <hi>Druide,</hi> I am of opinion that ſhe does
not wiſh him ill. You are not ſingular in your opinion, Madam, replied <hi>Aſtrea;</hi>
for I have obſerved that the addreſſes of this Shepherd are not at all diſpleaſing unto
her; and the truth is, <hi>Sylvander</hi> is no deſpiſeable Shepherd, nor have I met with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of more merit. Upon this ſhe ſtood ſilent, and ſo did <hi>Alexis.</hi> At laſt <hi>Aſtrea</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
again, with a deep ſigh; It is moſt certain (ſaid ſhe) that <hi>Diana</hi> does love this
Shepherd, and both <hi>Phillis</hi> and my ſelf are the cauſe of it; for we did conſtrain her
even by force, to permit <hi>Sylvander</hi> to make addreſs unto her; and though it was at the
firſt in jeſt, yet it proved afterwards in good earneſt; and I foreſee, that unleſs ſhe
take good heed, ſhe will not ſo eaſily diſ-engage her ſelf as ſhe imagines. Be pleaſed
to know Madam, that <hi>Sylvander</hi> is a Shepherd unknown, and nothing beholding unto
Fortune, ſince ſhe has concealed from him, both his Country, and the knowledge of
his Parents: So as <hi>Diana,</hi> who has as high a mind as any Shepherdeſs in all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood,
will never permit <hi>Sylvander</hi> to ſerve her openly, be his merits never ſo great:
nor would her Parents, who are the principal of all about the Banks of the Fatal
<hi>Lignon,</hi> allow of it: And yet I ſee that <hi>Sylvander</hi> is ſo much taken with her Beauty
and Perfections, as I dare lay a wager, that nothing in the world, neither the rigour
of the Shepherdeſs, nor the forbiddance of Parents, nor any other obſtacle whatſoever,
can divert him; ſo as when <hi>Diana</hi> commanding him to ſpeak no more unto her, as he
did, during the wager, he will conſtrain himſelf a little, but it will be abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for him to overcome himſelf; ſo as after ſo many great expreſſions of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the more he would hide it, the more will ſhe ſee it through his conſtraint. I will
not ſay any thing of what I have already thought concerning <hi>Diana;</hi> for loving her as
I do, I ſhould be very ſorry to ſee her any way miſcarry; and yet conſidering the way
ſhe takes, it is almoſt impoſſible ſhe ſhould do otherwiſe. What does ſhe intend to
do? asked <hi>Alexis.</hi> The good opinion which ſhe juſtly has of her own merits (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Aſtrea</hi>) will not permit her to allow of <hi>Sylvander</hi>'s Courtſhip, but makes her
reſolve to have recourſe unto thoſe extream remedies of forbidding him, which women
uſe unto ſuch whoſe Courtſhip is diſpleaſing unto them. I do not like her way (ſaid
<hi>Alexis</hi>) and if ſhe follow it, ſhe will repent it: For <hi>Sylvander</hi> loving her as he does,
he will not be diverted by it; and then, as you ſay, the buſineſs will become the talk of
the Country. But ſhe had better take one of theſe two ways, either to let him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
his addreſſes under the vail of a Fiction; for which excuſes enough are to be
found; or elſe permit him ſecretly to make his addreſſes: For I muſt confeſs, Fair
Shepherdeſs, that the Vertues of <hi>Diana,</hi> and the Merits of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> makes me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
they may live contentedly, though it be to the diſadvantage of <hi>Paris</hi> my Brother,
who I know does love her; but it is better he ſhould miſs of his deſires, then by-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
them, to make two of ſo much merit, miſerable all the reſt of their days: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<hi>Diana</hi> loving my Brother only by reaſons of Eſtate, Doubtleſs the loſs of one ſo
dear unto her as <hi>Sylvander</hi> is, would make her ſo full of ſorrow, and ſo much change
her, that my Brother could not take any great delight in her: And though this do at
the firſt diſpleaſe <hi>Paris,</hi> yet he will better paſs it over then <hi>Sylvander</hi> can, having not
ſo violent an affection unto <hi>Diana</hi> as that Shepherd hath. Moreover, we ſhall more
eaſily divert him from it, by propounding ſome other marriage unto him, more ſutable
unto his quality.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch diſcourſe as this, they came unto the Town of <hi>Phocion,</hi> who received them
very kindly, and treated them with ſo neat a ſupper; that <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Daphnide</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
he ſhamed the great Cities. But <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was not ſo well contented as ſhe deſired: For
<hi>Phocion</hi> had young <hi>Calidon</hi> there, and ſet him at the Table juſt oppoſite unto her:
This young Shepherd was ſo paſſionately in Love, that his eyes were never off her;
which troubled <hi>Aſtrea</hi> extreamly: for ſhe could never look up, but ſtill met with his
eye upon her. <hi>Alexis,</hi> who was of <hi>Calidons</hi> mind, did the very ſame, though with
much more ſatisfaction unto <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who alſo could not ſatisfie her eyes with looking
upon <hi>Celadon</hi> under the umbrage of a woman: But <hi>Alexis</hi> had the advantage of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53527:107"/>
for having <hi>Aſtrea</hi> on her ſide, they could talk together and not be heard, which
they did almoſt all ſupper while: And becauſe <hi>Alexis</hi> obſerved the eyes of <hi>Calidon,</hi>
ſhe ſaid unto <hi>Astrea:</hi> Fair Shepherdeſſe do you not think that you ſit in a very ill
place? I ſhall never think ſo, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> as long as I am ſo neer you, which is
the greateſt contentment I can have; but I wiſh that ſome troubleſome eyes which are
continually on my face, were turned ſome other way, or elſe that the owner of them
were further off. The trouble which you endure, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> is a conſequent of your
beauty; and you muſt not think it ſtrange, that Shepherds ſhould Love you, ſince I
who am a woman, and one who never ſaw you before this three or four dayes, am ſo
extreamly taken with you, that I think my ſelf in Love with you. As <hi>Alexis</hi> ſpoke
theſe words ſhe changed countenance: The Zeal of her expreſſion, or her fear of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too plainly, was the cauſe of it. <hi>Astrea</hi> anſwered her with a ſmiling eye, I wiſh with
all my heart Madam, that there were any thing in me which might do you any real ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and ingratiate me into your favour: For I am ſo perfectly yours that nothing
but death can ſever me from you and I think the happineſs of it ſo great, that I would
not change contentment with all the Kings, Emperors, and Monarchs upon earth.
<hi>Alexis</hi> fearing that if theſe expreſſions continued, hearers would think they talked too
paſſionately for women, ſhe took her hand, and wiſpered unto her, I will ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
life then this aſſurance you give me: but for ſome reaſons which afterwards I will

to morrow when we walk in the woods.</p>
                     <p>After ſupper ended, and tables removed, many Neighboring young Shepherds
came to dance and ſing, and rejoyce, for finding the Miſsletoe of the New-year, for
ſo they called it. And becauſe <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> were deſirous to be ſpectators of
their harmleſſe ſports, they deſired <hi>Adamas</hi> he would be pleaſed they might wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> out
and ſee the Shepherds and Fair Shepherdeſſes dance. <hi>Adamas</hi> who was willing to give
them all poſſible ſatisfaction, he took <hi>Daphnide</hi> by the hand, and led her forth, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Leonide</hi> to conduct <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and all the reſt of the Company, who followed them
into a great room, where ſuch publique rejoycings were wont to be kept, and where
they found abundance of Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes dancing and ſinging.</p>
                     <p>The Sun had been long ſet, and no day appeared; but the Moon ſhined ſo cleer, as
if ſhe had borrowed more light then uſual, purpoſely for that night: <hi>Daphnide</hi> was
much taken with the pleaſantneſs of the place, and coolneſs of the air: And all ſitting
down, ſome on one ſide, ſome on another, they began to dance and ſing, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
their parts ſo handſomly, that <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> could not chuſe but admire
the Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon.</hi> After they had danced half an hour, there
came from the neighboring Towns, a company of Shepherds diſguiſed in the habit of
Egyptians, who danced after the manner of that people: And as they had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
taught by <hi>Alcippe</hi> the father of <hi>Celadon,</hi> upon his return from his long travels,
they danced unto ſongs, and ſang as they danced: And when they had done, they
went unto all the company, and offered to tell the Fortunes of all ſuch who would
ſhew them their hands. This paſtime having laſted long, and it being almoſt midnight,
<hi>Adamas</hi> thought it time to retire: So as they all parted, and went unto their Towns,
<hi>Phocion</hi> carried unto his houſe, <hi>Adamas, Paris, Alexis,</hi> and <hi>Leonide,</hi> being very ſorry
that his houſe was not of capacity to lodge <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> with their company
alſo. But <hi>Adamas</hi> thinking before hand that he could not do it with any conveniency,
he appointed <hi>Lycidas</hi> to lodg them in the houſe of <hi>Celadon,</hi> where <hi>Diamis</hi> his uncle
expected them; but by reaſon of his old age left the management of all things unto
<hi>Lycidas,</hi> which that Shepherd did perform very exactly, though he was extreamly
perplexed, that he could not have the company of his dear <hi>Phillis</hi> in his houſe: For
ſhe told him, that if he would bid thoſe ſtrangers welcome, ſhe would go with <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
and lye with her.</p>
                     <p>Thus every one retired to their lodgings, <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by <hi>Sylvander,</hi> they carryed <hi>Adamas</hi> unto <hi>Aſtreas</hi> houſe, where <hi>Phocion</hi> ſtayed
to bid them welcome as well as he could. The Chambers were ordered thus; <hi>Adamas</hi>
and <hi>Paris</hi> did lie in one, where <hi>Phocion</hi> was wont to lie; <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leonide</hi> were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to lie in that which was wont to be <hi>Aſtreas,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> took another. When <hi>Adamas</hi>
underſtood that the chambers were thus ordered, he did not like that <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
ſhould be alone together in a chamber, fearing leſt the Female <hi>Druide,</hi> ſhould, by a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53527:107"/>
miracle of Love become a Shepherd, and leſt <hi>Leonide,</hi> whom he knew did not hate
<hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhould carreſs <hi>Alexis</hi> ſo much, as to make him caſt off his <hi>Druides</hi> habit:
And therefore, taking <hi>Leonide</hi> aſide, he ſaid unto her, that when all the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes
were retired, he would have <hi>Alexis</hi> come ſecretly, and lie in his chamber; and
though there was but two beds in it, yet it was no matter; for <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould lie with
him, and <hi>Alexis</hi> ſhould lie in the other. I thought upon that before, (anſwered
the Nimph) but I thought it not expedient, becauſe ſome of the houſe might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
come in and ſee her, which would be no ſmall ſcandal: beſides, <hi>Paris</hi> perhaps
might take notice of her. What courſe (replied <hi>Adamas</hi>) would you then take?
For I do not think you can find a better way: Pardon me good father, replied ſhe;
I conceive it much better for <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and I to lie together in one bed, and <hi>Alexis</hi> in
the other.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps (ſaid <hi>Adamas</hi>) that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> loving <hi>Alexis</hi> better then ſhe does you,
ſhe will deſire to lye with her rather then with you. If ſhe needs will do ſo, anſwered
the Nimph, then let her, and I will take the other bed: but you may do as I ſay
very eaſily; for if you come under pretence of ſeeing us: you may ſay it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
we ſhould put <hi>Aſtrea</hi> out of her Chamber, that it is enough you have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
<hi>Phocion</hi> out of his, and ſo you may appoint that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and I ſhould lye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
pretending that the daughters of <hi>Druides</hi> never uſe to lye with any, but by
themſelves. <hi>Adamas</hi> thought this invention to be good: And <hi>Phocion</hi> being reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he commanded <hi>Paris</hi> to go to bed, and then he came to viſit <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide;</hi>
but he found the Chamber fuller then he expected, there being with <hi>Aſtrea,
Diana</hi> and <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who was diſcourſing upon his difference with <hi>Diana,</hi> when
the <hi>Druide</hi> entred: Daughters, ſaid he, I come to ſee how you are lodged, but I
perceive you are very troubleſome unto the Fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for I underſtand that it is
her Chamber. It is true Sir, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but both my Chamber and my ſelf
are much honoured in that we are able to do any ſervice unto ſuch whom I love ſo
infinitely. Daughter, replied <hi>Adamas,</hi> I will not upon any termes ſuffer you to go
out of it; <hi>Leonide</hi> and you may lye together; and did not the Laws of <hi>Druides</hi>
daughters forbid it, I ſhould intreat the Fair <hi>Diana</hi> take half of a bed with <hi>Alexis.</hi>
Father, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> the bed is ſo large, as we may lye all three together without
any trouble. And becauſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> out of reſpect unto the Nimph, ſeemed not to be
willing. No, no, replied <hi>Adamas, Leonide</hi> and my daughter ſhall go into my
Chamber, were we will lye as well as we can, unleſſe you reſolve to lye altogether,
for I will not by any means, you ſhould have any other Chamber then this, <hi>Diana,</hi>
then ſeeing it was the will of <hi>Adamas,</hi> gave her conſent, and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Diana</hi>
conſented, obeyed the <hi>Druide:</hi> All this while <hi>Alexis</hi> ſtood mute, ſo amazed to ſee
her ſelf in <hi>Aſtreas</hi> houſe, and to lye with her, though not in the ſame bed, yet in
the ſame Chamber with her, as he thought this to be a fault unpardonable if ever it
was known unto her. <hi>Adamas</hi> obſerving it when he bad good night unto all the
reſt, took her hand and ſaid unto her. I think daughter, the length of the way has
much wearied you, it is good for you to lie long in bed to morrow, and reſt your
ſelf; for <hi>Phocion</hi> has deſired me to retain <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> here two or three
dayes, ſo as if you be but ready againſt dinner it is time enough: Afterwards he
whiſpered her in the ear; <hi>Alexis,</hi> (ſaid he) what makes you ſo ſad? Take heed
you do not ſpoil the plot which we have thus far carried on ſo well; and from which
you may expect ſo much contentment. Then <hi>Adamas</hi> retired to his Chamber,
leaving <hi>Alexis</hi> ſo aſtoniſhed that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> took notice of it; and believing that the
length of the way had done her ſome harm, ſhe ſhewed abundance of ſorrow to ſee
her in that condition. But <hi>Leonide</hi> who knew well enough where her ſhooe did pinch
her, did anſwer for her; No, no, <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſaid ſhe, never trouble your ſelf, her pain
will be quickly over: I have ſeen her often in theſe fits, and well again preſently.
But me thinks (ſaid ſhe and turned towards <hi>Sylvander</hi>) that it is time for this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
to retire, it being not long before it will be day. Madam, anſwered <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
I ſhall be quickly gone, ſo I may but carry with me what I brought hither.
<hi>Diana</hi> knowing that he meant her; Shepherd ſaid ſhe, I do not intend to ſtir from
hence this night, but I will put <hi>Phillis</hi> in my room whom you may wait upon home
as if it was my ſelf, and to morrow I will expect you give me an account of her
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53527:108"/>
here, where I promiſe to expect you about ten or eleven of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
What power, I beſeech you, anſwered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> have you to give her unto
me? The ſame power, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> that ſhe has to diſpoſe of me, when ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.
I had rather, replied he, taſt her liberality then yours. It is enough for this
time (ſaid <hi>Leonide</hi>) that <hi>Diana</hi> to ſhew what an abſolute victory you have gotten,
does let you carry your enemie away as a priſoner. I had rather Madam, replied
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> be a priſoner unto her, who gave me the victory, and be tyed never to
ſtir from her, then to be the Conqueror of this enemy, whom ſhe hath put into my
hands. <hi>Phillis</hi> offered to reply, when <hi>Lycidas,</hi> according to his promiſe, came to
wait upon her; and then looſing her ſelf from the hands of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſee ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Shepherd, ſaid ſhe unto him, how the Heavens does puniſh you! I have now
nothing to do with you, and before you get me your priſoner again, you muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
better Arms. Upon this, bidding good night unto <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leonide,</hi> and
kiſſing <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> being very ſorry (as ſhe ſaid) to leave them, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
conſtrained for want of room, ſhe went to her own houſe, and was conducted
by <hi>Lycidas</hi> and <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who according to their cuſtome, did wrangle and argue, all
the way.</p>
                     <p>In the interim, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was ſo buſie, and officious about her dear <hi>Alexis,</hi> in
helping to undreſſe her, as ſhe would not ſuffer her to unpin, one pin; and the
<hi>Druide</hi> was willing to allow it as long as poſſibly ſhe could: but when ſhe came to
put off her Gown, fearing leſt ſhe ſhould find ſome fault with her breſts, ſhe beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto <hi>Leonide;</hi> who knowing what ſhe meant, came unto <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> Come, come,
Fair Shepherdeſſe, (ſaid ſhe unto her) let us undreſs our ſelves, for I ſee you do but
trouble my ſiſter, and will trouble her more, unleſs vve make haſt to bed; for ſhe
has a cuſtome to fall a ſleep immediately; and if we do not the like, we ſhall awake
her, and then ſhe can ſleep no more that night; therefore let us make all the haſt
to bed vve can, leaſt vve ſhould diſturb he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> This cauſed <hi>Aſtrea</hi> to vvithdraw, and
give the <hi>Druide</hi> time to undreſs her ſelf, and get into bed unſeen. Her hair, which
ſhe let grow vvhileſt ſhe was in her cave, and ever ſince ſhe had the name of <hi>Alexis,</hi>
vvas now ſo long as might vvell become a vvoman; and if ſhe had but any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
care in dreſſing her ſelf, ſhe might eaſily make it paſs: but it vvas impoſſible
for her, to remedy her breſts, and therefore ſhe took all poſſible care to hide
them, though it vvas a hard matter to conceal them from any that vvould take any
particular notice. Having therefore pinned her ſmock before her breſts, and at
the ſleeves, ſhe drew the Curtaines towards that ſide where <hi>Aſtrea</hi> undreſſed her
ſelf; and calling <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſiſter (ſaid ſhe) you vvill much oblige me, if you come
hither and undreſs your ſelf by my bed-ſide, to keep me from ſleeping untill you be
all in bed; <hi>Leonide</hi> vvho knew the reaſon vvhy ſhe ſaid ſo: I vvill ſiſter (anſwered
ſhe) but then I muſt have theſe fair ones to keep me company; then all three came
unto her bed-ſide: <hi>Leonide</hi> did ſit in chair, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> upon the bed, vvhileſt <hi>Diana</hi>
went unto the table, to reach ſomething vvhich <hi>Leonide</hi> left: <hi>Alexis,</hi> raiſing her
ſelf up in her bed, ſhe helped <hi>Aſtrea</hi> to undreſſe her, one vvhile taking off a knot,
another vvhile unpinning a pin, and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> vvould ſometimes kiſſe the hand of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi>
as it paſſed neer her mouth; and <hi>Alexis</hi> in requital of the favour, vvould
kiſs that part of her own hand vvhich <hi>Aſtrea</hi> kiſſed; ſo raviſhed vvith joy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
that <hi>Leonide</hi> took great delight in ſeeing ſuch exceſs of happineſs. A great
part of the night vvas thus ſpent, and had they not heard thoſe birds, vvhich uſe to
rejoyce at the approach of day, they had hardly parted ſo ſoon: but <hi>Leonide</hi> with
much ado, cauſed <hi>Alexis</hi> to let <hi>Aſtrea</hi> go; vvho being all undreſſed at her beds
feet, <hi>Alexis</hi> ſaw her naked arm, as vvhite as any Aliblaſter, and alſo her naked
breſts, as vvhich no Snow had ſo perfect a vvhite: Love vvounded the heart of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi>
moſt deeply, at the ſight of theſe: How oft vvas this diſguiſed <hi>Druide</hi> in a mind
to lay aſide the habit of a vvoman, and become a Shepherd? And how oft did he
again check himſelf for his boldneſſe? At laſt, <hi>Leonide,</hi> vvho obſerved his raptures,
and diſorder, thought fit to part them. And bidding the laſt good night unto her
ſiſter, ſhee vvith <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> vvent to bed, leaving poor <hi>Alexis</hi> alone in
appearance; but indeed ſo accompanied, that it vvas impoſſible for her to cloſe an
eye: So as it being light day, and ſhe not able to ſleep, ſhe caſt her eye upon the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53527:108"/>
bed where <hi>Aſtrea</hi> lay; it being very hot weather, in the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> theſe
Fair ones left their Curtains open; and the Sun diſperſed its Rays ſo ſplendidly into
the Chamber, that the curious eye of this diſguiſed <hi>Druide,</hi> might eaſily ſee <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
who by chance lay almoſt out of the bed; <hi>Leonide</hi> lay in the midſt; that, as ſhe ſaid,
ſhe might make it her boaſt, ſhe had lain between two of the greateſt Beauties in the
whole world: And indeed, ſhe did ſo; for never was two different Beauties more
exactly perfect then theſe two. Judge then what a Viſion had <hi>Alexis,</hi> when he
ſaw <hi>Aſtrea</hi> thus; one of her Arms hung careleſly out of the Bed, and hardly any
difference could be found betwixt her ſmock and it in whiteneſs; her other Arm lay
under her head, and cauſed the right ſide of her Breaſt to lie naked, with which the
Sun ſeemed to be in love, and kiſſed, by ſhining upon it. O Love! How many
ſeveral ways thou haſt to torment thoſe who are thy Subjects! How didſt thou treat
this Shepherd in his ſolitary Cave, when being deprived of the ſight of his Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs,
thou madeſt him to lament his abſence from this Fair one? And at this time,
How doſt thou torment him with too much light, and blinding his eyes by two
Suns; ſo as whether abſent or preſent, he is ſtill tormented? This thought did ſo
poſſeſs the mind of <hi>Alexis,</hi> that before ever he took any notice of it, the Sun was
a great height; And had not <hi>Aſtrea</hi> by chance turned on the other ſide, and by
that means taking this pleaſant Viſion from his eye, doubtleſs he had looked longer:
but being deprived of the light of this glorious Sun, ſhe thought her ſelf in darkneſs,
and that the other Sun gave no light. At the laſt, not being able to abide in theſe
impatiences, ſhe aroſe ſoftly out of her bed, dreſs'd her ſelf without any noiſe, and
went unto the bed of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who was turned towards <hi>Leonide,</hi> with her right Arm
over her, and her cheek upon her ſhoulder. What jealouſie, or rather, what envie
did ſhe not conceive againſt this Nymph? Oh heavens! (ſaid ſhe unto her ſelf) too
happy <hi>Leonide,</hi> how canſt thou ſleep, and have ſuch a glorious occaſion to wake?
Canſt thou ſhut thy eyes, and employ them upon any thing then looking upon this
Beauty, which every one ought to adore? Then ſtaying a while mute; What ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Injuſtice is in the Fate of things here below? (replyed ſhe preſently after)
Why ſhould this inſenſible Nymph have a happineſs which ſhe cannot enjoy? And
why ſhould I who am infinitely deſirous of it, be thus unjuſtly deprived? Then
folding her Arms upon her Breaſt, ſhe retired back a pace or two, not removing her
eye from this pleaſing object: And after ſhe had long contemplated upon it; Oh
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> (ſaid ſhe a little louder) will you never recal me from my baniſhment? And
muſt I, without knowing the cauſe, Live continually in your preſence, as if I were
diſtant from you? But againſt whom ſhould I complain, ſince Fortune has brought
me nearer my happineſs, then ever I could expect or hope for? And why ſhould I
not try Fortune a little further? Perhaps ſhe will as well give me as high content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as before ſhe dejected me into the Abyſs of miſery: Courage Shepherd, why
art thou ſo fearful to approach this Fair one? Why doſt thou not beg her pardon,
and reſtore <hi>Celadon</hi> unto her, whom thou haſt ſtoln from her under the habit of
<hi>Alexis?</hi> Say unto her, Here is the Shepherd whom you ſo much loved; Here is
<hi>Celadon</hi> that has given you his heart, and all that's his: You did once love him;
and if <hi>Celadon</hi> has done any thing which hath offended you, then open this Breaſt
which he here preſents unto you, and take that which is your own, his heart; which
moſt certainly never conſented unto any thing that could offend you. As thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thus unto her, fall down upon thy knees, and preſent thy naked Breaſt unto her,
that if ſhe pleaſe, ſhe may take that heart which loves and adores her, and which
cannot reſt until it be in her fair hands. Upon this <hi>Alexis</hi> all in a rapture, ſtepped
forward, as if he did intend to effect his thoughts; and perhaps had now diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf, had he not upon a ſudden reprehended himſelf thus. Oh <hi>Celadon</hi> (ſaid
he) canſt thou be thus diſobedient unto the command of this Shepherdeſs? Muſt
thou be upbraided with failing in the Laws of perfect Love? Haſt thou thus long
ſerved this Fair one with unſtained affection, and now by an imprudent and raſh Act,
which will bring thee too late repentance, ſpoil all? O <hi>Celadon,</hi> Doſt thou not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
theſe words? Go diſloyal Lover, and never ſee me again, till I command thee;
Canſt thou (I ſay) remember this, and have ſo little affection as to dare to diſobey?
No, no (ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d he) Die, die firſt, and carry to the grave a pure and innocent love,
without any ſtain or reproach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53527:109"/>
Upon this, with teares in her eyes, ſhe went out of the chamber to view thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where formerly ſhe had received ſo much contentment, and to ask an account
of all thoſe ſighes and deſires which ſhe had ſo often committed to their cuſtody.
At firſt ſhe went into the garden, through which an arm of the River <hi>Lignon</hi> runs:
Then looked upon the Fountain, which is in the midſt of it; over which ſtands the
Goddeſſe <hi>Ceres</hi> upon an Arch, ſupported by great Columns; and under which is a
great Baſin, reſembling a Crown, that receives this pleaſant ſource. Approching
unto this Fountain, ſhe there waſhed her hands, and her face, as formerly ſhe was
wont; and looking upon it, here is the very place, ſaid ſhe, where <hi>Aſtrea</hi> has ſo
often vowed eternal affection unto me. This is the Fountain where taking my
hand in hers, ſhe ſwore that ſhe would ſooner ceaſe to live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then ceaſe to love <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon:</hi>
Then ſtepping forward with a trembling pace to the baſin which held the
water, here are the Letters of our Names, ſaid he, engraved by her own hand; Oh
ye witneſſes of my extream affection! and now ye juſt accuſers of the faireſt Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
in the world, why are you not defaced out of this Marble, as well as out of
her heart? Or do you remain here ſtill to upbraid her with her change? Then going
from this Fountain, ſhe went into a little wood of Haſels, where the walks are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
with ſo many turnings and windings, that they will deceive thoſe that walk in
them, and make them loſe their way in going out again. This was the place which
brought into his memory his paſt happineſs, which he now reſented ſo bitterly,
that his teares did teſtifie his grief: For it was in this little wood, where he was
wont to talk often with his Fair Shepherdeſſe, when their Parents even weary with
croſſing their loves, did permit them more liberty of ſeeing each other, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, then before they uſed. Calling into memory therefore all the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which ſhe reſented in that place, and all the vowes of fidelity which ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from her Shepherdeſſe, ſhe could not chuſe, but wonder that ſhe could forget
all the vowes and oathes which ſhe had ſworn in that place.</p>
                     <p>This thought entertained her a long while, not without the company of many a
ſigh, and many a tear; and had not her walk conducted her before ſhe was aware
unto the ſide of that arm of the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> which ran about all the Garden, ſhe
had not ſo ſoon got out: but the ſight of this River did ſo freſhly revive the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of her former happineſſe, as ſhe could not chuſe but ſit down upon the bank,
and was ſo much tranſported out of her ſelf, as it was a long time before ſhe knew
where ſhe was.</p>
                     <p>All this while ſhe did not remember that perhaps <hi>Aſtrea</hi> would wake, and that
<hi>Leonide</hi> and ſhe, not finding her in the chamber, would wonder extreamly what
was become of her. And ſo it hapned; for it being already late enough <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
wakned, and the Sun ſhining very gloriouſly into the room, ſhe looked towards
the bed of <hi>Alexis:</hi> but ſeeing all the Curtaines open and none in bed, ſhe raiſed her
ſelf a little higher in the bed to look a little better, and ſeeing ſhe was not there, ſhe
could not chuſe but ſigh ſo loud that <hi>Leonide</hi> heard her, and asked her whether ſhe
was ſick: No, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but I am troubled that I cannot ſee <hi>Alexis</hi> in the
bed where ſhe lay the laſt night; How! ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> and ſtarted up, is ſhee not
there? Then raiſing her ſelf a little, and finding it true, and that the door was
open: what in the name of Heaven is become of her? ſaid ſhe. I beleeve, ſaid
<hi>Diana,</hi> that ſhe is gone to walk before the heat of the day begin: <hi>Leonide</hi> was
afraid that the melancholy humour of <hi>Celadon</hi> might make <hi>Alexis</hi> take up ſome
new reſolution: yet leaſt ſhe ſhould diſcover too much of her thoughts unto theſe
Shepherdeſſes; I beſeech you, ſaid ſhe, unto them, let me dreſſe my ſelf as ſoon as
I can, and ſee if I can find her: for if <hi>Adamas</hi> ſhould know that I let her go alone,
he would be very angry with me: The Shepherdeſſes roſe all out of bed, and made
ſuch haſt, that they were ready before the Nimph although ſhe made all the haſt
that poſſibly ſhe could. And going by Fortune out of the ſame door, which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into the Garden, they went unto the Fountain of <hi>Ceres,</hi> which <hi>Leonide</hi> found
to be a very fine piece, and exquiſitly wrought: From thence they went forward
into the grove of <hi>Hazels,</hi> and as if they were guided through that Labyrinth by the
thred of <hi>Ariadne,</hi> they came directly to the River ſide, where <hi>Alexis</hi> was lying
upon the ground; and as fortune would have, it was riſing up to view the reſt of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53527:109"/>
thoſe places, where ſhe had left ſo many marks of her former contentments, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
affection. <hi>Astrea</hi> ſpied her firſt, and ſhewing her unto the Nimph, ſaid unto
her, I think Madam, that <hi>Diana</hi> can divine; for ſee where the <hi>Druide</hi> is walking
all alone upon the banks of the water, which runs into that fatal River of <hi>Lignon,
Leonide</hi> then ſeeing that <hi>Alexis</hi> had no ſuch intention as ſhe feared, ſhe was very
joyfull: but as ſhe was advancing towards her, ſhe heard one call upon her, and
turning her ſelf about, ſhe ſaw it was <hi>Paris,</hi> who ſeemed a far off very deſirous to
ſpeak with her; and becauſe ſhe knew not what his buſineſſe might be, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it might be ſuch as was not for <hi>Diana</hi> to hear: Fair ones, ſaid ſhe, I beſeech
you go you unto <hi>Alexis,</hi> and ſtay with her, whileſt I go and ſee what buſineſſe
<hi>Paris</hi> hath with me. The Shepherdeſſes were very glad of this commiſſion; for
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> longed to ſee the face of <hi>Celadon</hi> in that <hi>Druide,</hi> whoſe voice, words and
geſtures, were ſo reſemblant unto that Shepherd, as ſhe took extream delight in her
company: and <hi>Diana</hi> was glad alſo to be thus rid of <hi>Paris,</hi> as well becauſe ſhe did
not love him, as becauſe love made her think very well of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and ſhe could
not permit her eares to hearken unto any words of affection, which came from any
mouth but of that kind Shepherd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leonide</hi> then went to meet <hi>Paris;</hi> and the two Shepherdeſſes went towards the
diſguiſed <hi>Druide,</hi> whom they found looking upon an old willow which time had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed,
and which retained no more of it ſelf but a hollow bulk, and a withered bark:
Oh Willow! ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi> to her ſelf, what is become of theſe letters which I truſted
thee with all? And why doſt thou not render me the ſame good offices thou wert
wont, in aſſuring me of my Shepherdeſſes good will? For thou ſeeſt me now with
no leſs love nor leſs affection then I had at that time: Oh beloved Willow, I know
thy meaning, for had the heart of my Faireſt Shepherdeſſe retained the memory
of my ſervices, thou vvouldſt have ſtill retained thoſe characters, vvhich vvere the
dear teſtimonies of her good will; but I ſee that time has vvorn both thee, and
them, out of her thoughts; had ſhe ſpoken theſe words any louder, the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes
had heard them; but as luck was, ſhe expreſſed them unto her ſelf only in
thought: And becauſe they were unwilling to interrupt thoſe pleaſing imaginations,
vvhich they thought ſhe fancied, they ſtopped; and vvhen the <hi>Druide</hi> vvalked, they
did the like, not vvith any intention to diſcover any thoughts of her ſoul, but only
leſt they ſhould divert her by their preſence from that which ſhe thought moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
<hi>Alexis</hi> then, thinking her ſelf alone, continued on her thoughts, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe
her vvalk along the River ſide, until ſhe found a Tree on her right hand, where
two dayes before her unfortunate accident, ſhe had engraved ſome verſes, which
teſtified vvith how much conſtraint ſhe courted the Shepherdeſſe <hi>Aminthe;</hi> and
caſting her eyes thereupon, Oh how this ſight did vvound her memory!</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the reading of thoſe vvords had made her ſpeak ſomething ſo loud as to
be heard by thoſe Shepherdeſſes, which followed her, if by fortune <hi>Sylvander</hi> at
the ſame time had not a far off began to ſing; and the voice came ſo diſtinctly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, that <hi>Alexis</hi> turning her head that way, eſpied the Shepherdeſſes
cloſe by her; ſhee vvas ſorry to ſee them ſo neer, and perceive them no ſooner,
fearing leſt her paſſion had made her utter ſome vvord, or uſe ſome action, vvhich
might diſcover vvhat ſhe deſired to conceal: But that which moſt troubled her vvas
her eyes, vvhich vvere full of tears, and which being ſo ſurpriſed ſhe could not hide;
yet faining not to ſee them, ſhe turned the other way, and vviped her eyes as well
as ſhe could, and then ſetting a good face upon it, ſhe came unto them, and bad
them good morrow, calling them ſluggards, and faining ſhe could not ſleep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the pretty birds began to ſing ſo ſweety at her chamber-window: It was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Madam, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> becauſe they troubled you. No indeed, anſwered
<hi>Alexis,</hi> for I took ſo much delight in their Muſick: that I could not chuſe but riſe
to hear them more plainly as I walked by this River ſide; and I think the time ſo
ſhort, that it ſeems not above a quarter of an hour ſince I came hither. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(anſwered <hi>Diana</hi>) you have ſlept ſo little, that I fear it will do you ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury:
It is true indeed, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> and you may ſee my eyes have done pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for it; but I was ſo much delighted in hearing the warble of theſe pretty
birds, and in taking the freſh ayr, that it is impoſſible to receive any harm. The
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53527:110"/>
beſt remedy will be, replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> to go to bed betimes at night, that you may
enjoy your reſt and ſleep before the day do break, and before theſe little chanters
of the wood begin to ſing; and then we ſhall Madam be glad to bear you company,
and carry you unto places which are better furniſhed with this kind of harmony.
<hi>Alexis</hi> offered to reply when <hi>Sylvander</hi> began to ſing, and becauſe they ſpied
<hi>Phillis</hi> coming towards them, they ſtayed for her, whileſt <hi>Sylvander</hi> ſung. <hi>Phillis</hi>
being come unto them; after ſhe had ſaluted the <hi>Druide</hi> and her company: Madam,
ſaid ſhe, how do you like this Shepherds voice? I like it very well, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi>
and think him to be a very well accompliſhed Shepherd, and a very perfect lover.
Madam, (anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> and both ſmiled and bluſhed) perhaps you may be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in your judgement of him; for the Shepherds of <hi>Lignon,</hi> do often hide diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
ſouls under the innocent habit which they wear. Perhaps indeed, replied the
<hi>Druide,</hi> that this may be ſo in ſome, but I am moſt confident, I am not miſtaken
in my opinion of this Shepherd. Tell her Madam (ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and interrupted her)
that ſhe her ſelf thinks the ſame; and that if the Shepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon</hi> were not
greater diſſemblers then this Shepherd, ſhe would not have ſpoken ſo as ſhe did.
Siſter replied <hi>Diana,</hi> I am much beholding to your rallary: for ſpeaking thus of
me in the preſence of this <hi>Druide,</hi> you will infuſe a ſtrange opinion of me into her.
Do not fear (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi> and ſmiled) that theſe words can make me believe any
thing of you but good: I know the virtue and merits of <hi>Diana</hi> very well; beſides,
diſſimulation is ſometimes ſo neceſſary unto our ſex: as it may well be taken for a
kind of virtue. But ſince we have gone ſo far, give me leave to tell you out of my
affection to you, what <hi>Phillis</hi> hath formerly ſaid unto your dear friend here, upon
the ſame ſubject: Madam, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> you will do me an honour in it, but
the worſt is, I fear it is nothing worthy of your paines, which you can tell me that
concerns my ſelf. I make no doubt, wiſe Shepherdeſſe (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) but you have
often heard the ſame which I ſhall tell you: but becauſe we are all oftentimes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
in our cauſes, and becauſe the advice of friends will do no harm, I will tell you
what diſcourſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and I, had yeſterday, concerning you: and I ſhall deſire <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
alſo to give her advice, becauſe I know you have a great confidence in them
both. Upon this, ſhe related unto <hi>Diana</hi> all the conſiderations which they had
upon <hi>Sylvanders</hi> love: and after they had all concluded, that it was no fiction nor
by reaſon of the wager, but reall and in good earneſt, ſhe continued thus: Now
Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> it concerns you to conſider well upon it; as for <hi>Sylvander,</hi> to love or
not to love you, does not depend upon him, he has but the choice of theſe two
wayes, either to grieve, or to live happily with you, even as you ſhall appoint.</p>
                     <p>But upon you does depend not only his miſery, and his happineſſe, but your own
alſo: And though I may believe that perhaps you are not ſenſible of thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which his love inflicts upon him; yet I conceive it very hard that one ſhould
be loved, and ſerved ſo diſcreetly by ſuch a very excellently qualified Shepherd, and
have no ſpark of good will towards him: but however it be, can you think to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
your ſelf from all the torment of it? And that you are not acceſſary unto his?
You are miſtaken, wiſe Shepherdeſſe, if you be in that opinion; for if you ſhould
forbid him to love you, you may as well do nothing; for you may be certain he
will not obey: and if by any rigorous language, you command him to get out of
your ſight, then the violence of his affection, will ſo divulge it ſelf all over the
Country, as perhaps not a Shepherd but will know it: So as I ſee the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is unevitable, unleſſe you reſolve upon ſome wiſe expedient. All thoſe that
know <hi>Sylvander,</hi> do think him a Shepherd ſo amiable, as they think there is not a
Shepherdeſſe, but may well daign to love him, and that the Shepherdeſſe whom he
loves may, if ſhe have any wit, very well do the like: what opinion then will the
world have of <hi>Diana,</hi> whom every one knows to have wit, and judgement, when
they ſee how this Shepherd loves her, ſerves her, and adores her with ſo much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
I ſhall by way of advice propoſe two wayes unto you, the one of which I
conceive more ſafe then the other: The one way is, ſince I ſee it a thing impoſſible
to divert this Shepherd from his affection to you, permit him to ſerve you ſecretly;
and this permiſſion will be a way by joyning his prudence unto yours, to hide this
affection from all ſuch as have nothing elſe to do, but cenſure and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y into the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53527:110"/>
of others. But if you do not love this Shepherd, this counſel is naught; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this ſecret correſpondency will oblige you unto certain indulgencies, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of affection, which may coſt you very dear: Therefore I conceive this other
expedient to be better; Let him continue that guiſe in which he hath hitherto ſerved
you; by this permiſſion, his flame will not flaſh with ſuch violence: and if by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
it ſhould ſo break out that every one takes notice of it, they wil not at all think it
ſtrange, becauſe he is already accuſtomed unto it: and his Courtſhip being under
that pretence of diſſimulation, they will not think he loves you in earneſt: I know
there will be ſome malevolent minds that will be ſpending their cenſures, but who
can avoid the laſh of ſuch tongues? But moſt will not believe it: And the beſt thing
of this way is, you will not be obliged unto him: For there is nothing ſo dangerous,
as for a woman to commit her ſelf unto the diſcretion of him ſhe loves; becauſe
moſt men being naturally of a wavering temper, when they change their affection,
they will not for all that loſe the memory of things paſt; but on the contrary, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make themſelves the more eſteemed, they blaze them abroad, and brag how
much they have been loved by ſuch a one; and the bad condition of our age being
as it is, and people more apt to believe the evil then the good, it is preſently believed
that ſuch a woman is a very loving ſoul, who will love more then ſhe is loved. Now
Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> by permitting him to continue his guiſe of diſſimulation, you will not be
in any danger this way, becauſe you are not obliged to render him any knowledge
of your good will: But on the contrary, may take his real affection as if it were Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and he cannot complain againſt you. This alſo is another thing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in this courſe: I know very well that <hi>Diana</hi> has a little vanity, and good reaſon
has ſhe for it, being a Sherherdeſs ſo full of perfections, and the principal in all this
Country; on the contrary, <hi>Sylvander</hi> being a perſon unknown, and Owner of no
Fortune but what his own Induſtry can get, I am afraid that <hi>Diana</hi> would bluſh if
any ſhould ſee her allow of any real addreſs from a Shepherd ſo much her inferiour.
But fair Shepherdeſs, you are by this expedient, exempt from this inconveniency,
having a good excuſe when you receive his complements of Love, as if all were but
in jeſt, to exerciſe his wit, and ſharpen it with feigned conceptions of an imaginary
Love.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Alexis</hi> ended; and when <hi>Diana</hi> would have anſwered, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> interrupted
her: Nay, nay Siſter (ſaid ſhe) there is no more to be ſaid, after this fair <hi>Druide;</hi>
She has cleared all doubts that could poſſibly be foreſeen, and fully anſwered them,
ſo as I ſhall not think you to be ſo wiſe as I ever took you, if you do not follow her
counſel; <hi>Phillis</hi> I am confident will be of the ſame opinion. But one thing does a
little ſcruple me, againſt which a remedy may haply be applyed; which is, That if
<hi>Diana</hi> do permit this diſguiſed Courtſhip of this Shepherd, ſhe muſt have a good
occaſion for the permiſſion, otherwiſe I am afraid the Artifice ſhould be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And you know, Madam, that if one he found jugling in one trick, all the reſt
of their actions will be ſuſpected. Never trouble your ſelf (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>) about that,
for <hi>Sylvander</hi> himſelf did yeſterday give an excellent occaſion to colour the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
For <hi>Diana</hi> told me, the laſt night when we were retired, that <hi>Sylvander</hi> having
obtained leave to continue his Courtſhip all the reſt of the day, he pretended that
this permiſſion was to laſt alwaies; and both he and ſhe falling in difference about it,
the buſineſs was referred unto <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and my ſelf; and ſhould have been determined
that ſame night: But becauſe <hi>Diana</hi> was not willing the matter ſhould be argued in
Publique, and both you, Madam, and <hi>Leonide</hi> being in the chamber, the difference
was deferred until another time; and <hi>Sylvander</hi> accompanying me to my Lodging,
he told me how glad he ſhould be if it could be deferred, becauſe till then he might
enjoy his Priviledge: There is no neceſſity therefore, that the buſineſs ſhould be
made ſo private; but on the contrary, I am of opinion, that the matter is to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
in ſome publique place; to the end, that when all do ſee <hi>Sylvander</hi> continue
his addreſſes to <hi>Diana,</hi> they may know it is upon the old ſcore as he begun it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did very well approve of this advice; and <hi>Diana,</hi> who perhaps
did like of it as well as they, and till then ſtood mute, ſhe ſeemed to be convinced by
the reaſons of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and the approbation of her two dear friends; ſo as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
that the difference ſhould come to hearing at ſuch a time when <hi>Adamas, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon,</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53527:111"/>
and <hi>Daphnide</hi> were preſent; and that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> ſhould give judgment
in the behalf of <hi>Sylvander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As fortune was, <hi>Sylvander</hi> hearing the voices of theſe fair Shepherdeſſes ſo near
him, he turned that way, and ſpied them; and ſeeing all their backs towards him,
being prompted by a Lovers curioſity, he got as near them as he could unſeen; and
creeping upon the ground, he got behind a Buſh which was within two or three pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the place where they were ſet; ſo liſtning attentively, he heard what <hi>Alexis</hi>
had propounded, and what was reſolved upon. Oh how much did he think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
obliged unto that fair <hi>Druide,</hi> for giving ſuch counſel unto <hi>Diana?</hi> And when
they went away, he did accompany them with a thouſand wiſhes of happineſs: and
when he ſaw them ſo far off as they could not think he heard them, he roſe up and
followed; and to make them look back, he began to play upon his Corner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> who loved this Shepherd very well, as one whom ſhe ranked in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of her beſt friends: Come <hi>Sylvander</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him) Do you not think
your ſelf much obliged unto me for bringing the fair <hi>Diana</hi> hither? For had I not
been, ſhe would have been ſtill in her chamber, and you deprived of your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in ſeeing her. Madam, anſwered the Shepherd, you cannot do me ſo great a
favour, as I expected always from your fair face. Why (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) does my face
promiſe you ſo much? Yes Madam (replyed <hi>Sylvander</hi>) for it has ſuch a lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of a Shepherd who would have expoſed his life for my contentment, as I
can think no leſs. I am very glad (anſwered <hi>Alexis</hi>) that Nature has been ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
unto me, as to make me like unto any whom you love; for I make no doubt,
but though I do not deſerve it, yet you will love me for his ſake. Madam, replied
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> were he alive, I ſhould love him for your ſake; your merits being ſo
high. as not to yeild unto any: And to let you ſee the truth of my words, I will put
my life into your hands, if you will be pleaſed to take ſo much pains as to judge a
difference which is dearer unto me then my life. Shepherd, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> Why
would you change the Judges which you have already choſen? Not but that I am
willing to ſubmit unto whatſoever the fair <hi>Alexis</hi> ſhall ordain; but me-thinks it is a
ſigne you know your cauſe to be bad, and would corrupt your Judges by flatteries,
and reject thoſe who are already choſen. I did not think, faireſt Miſtris, anſwered
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> That any praiſes which one could give unto this fair Lady, was eſteemed
flattery; for merit cannot be flattered, nor can any flattery equal her perfections.
I would not have you think I refuſe thoſe Judges which you were pleaſed to chuſe;
But I propounded this fair <hi>Druide</hi> only to be an Umpire in caſe thoſe two Judges
cannot agree amongſt themſelves; and that then ſhe ſhould ordain what ſhe thought
moſt conſonant to Juſtice. I cannot deny (anſwered <hi>Diana</hi>) the advantagious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
which you give of this fair Lady, nor any commendation that can be given her,
and therefore I do moſt willingly accept her for our Umpire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sylvander</hi> would have replied, had they not ſeen coming <hi>Adamas, Daphnide, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon,</hi>
and all the company which ſupped the night before at the houſe of old <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi>
except <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> who parted from the reſt of the company, to finiſh
the diſcourſe which they had begun in the houſe of <hi>Adamas:</hi> for <hi>Paris</hi> adoring <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
beyond all meaſure, and having received from her another kind of anſwer then
he deſired, he would take <hi>Leonides</hi> counſel in the buſineſs; and ſhe being very affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
to him, was willing to give him the beſt advice ſhe could: And therefore
retiring themſelves into the Grove of <hi>Hazles,</hi> Brother (ſaid ſhe unto him) I have
twice deferred the giving you my opinion in the buſineſs whereof you ſpoke, hoping
that time would alter your mind; but now, ſince I ſee nothing will work any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in it: I beſeech you tell me what your intention is. Siſter, replied <hi>Paris,</hi>
my intention is, to Court <hi>Diana</hi> in the way of marriage. And do you think (ſaid
<hi>Leonide</hi>) that <hi>Adamas</hi> will approve of it, for you ought to have a ſpecial conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of that? I have not expreſly acquainted him with it (ſaid <hi>Paris</hi>) but he
knows that I do love her, and does not diſapprove of it. This (anſwered <hi>Leonide</hi>)
is not enough; you ought to acquaint him with it ſeriouſly, and ask his conſent. In
the ſecond place, which indeed ought to be the firſt, you ought to conſider ſeriouſly
with your ſelf, whether this marriage be fit and convenient for you: For Love is a
partial Judge, and many things are handſome in a Miſtris, which are inſufferable in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53527:111"/>
a Wife. Oh Brother, there is abundance of difference betwixt Love and Marriage:
for Love laſts no longer then one pleaſeth, but Marriage muſt continue long, and
therefore is more diſpleaſing: Love is an Embleme of Liberty, becauſe it never
forceth the Will; but Marriage on the contrary is an Embleme of ſervitude; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
nothing but death can break the Bonds. 'Tis true, when a marriage is made
between fit and ſutable perſons, I believe there is no greater happineſs amongſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
becauſe all joys and contentments are doubled; the joy of the one, is the joy
of the other: And becauſe ſuch is the miſery of all Mortals, as they are ſubject
unto a thouſand diſaſters of Fortune, a faithful companion in marriage, does help to
bear the burthen of them. To be brief, it is almoſt impoſſible to enjoy any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
happineſs without a ſecond ſelf, unto whom all things may be communicated.
But <hi>Paris,</hi> give me leave to tell you, that the man who marries, muſt not conſult
altogether with his eyes, or his deſires; but with his reaſon and judgement; and
you muſt conſider whether there be any thing deſirable in <hi>Diana</hi> beſides her Beauty,
not only as a Miſtris, but alſo as a Wife: For Beauty does ordinarily deceive, and is
often like an Inn-ſigne before a poor Inn, where no good accomodations can be had.
Beauty reſembles thoſe Spectacles which makes every thing look greater then they
are, and is at beſt but a fair fading Flower, which when once decayed, and one is
tyed unto it, repentance comes too late: So much in conſideration of Beauty. Then
Brother, Great heed muſt be taken that nothing be done which may redound unto
your diſhonour and reproach; You are ſon unto the Grand <hi>Druide; Diana</hi> I muſt
needs confeſs is a Shepherdeſs of much merit, but yet ſhe is a Shepherdeſs; and do
you think that ſuch Alliance will not be much wondred at? We are not born for our
ſelves; we muſt ſomtimes leave our own contentment, for the ſatisfaction of thoſe
who love us, and thoſe unto whom we are obliged: Conſider Brother, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is the happineſs or the miſery of every one: and therefore be not too raſh in
your actions. But to wave all theſe conſiderations, this only is enough for all: That
one had better be a Gally-ſlave, and be tyed to ſerve a Tyrant, then marry one that
loves him not; Imagine Brother, What delight can one find in eating, or drinking,
lying, or ſleeping with his enemy? It is requiſite therefore that you know her mind;
For if ſhe do love another, or cannot love you, I would adviſe you to marry a grave,
rather then <hi>Diana.</hi> Think well upon all theſe things; and after you have ſeriouſly
conſidered them, tell me what you think of them, then I will further tell you what I
conceive beſt to be done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paris</hi> hearing <hi>Leonide</hi> ſpeak with ſo much conſideration and eagerneſs, did think
at firſt that ſhe had ſome deſigne to marry him ſomwhere elſe, and therefore deſired
to divert him from <hi>Diana;</hi> But afterwards ſeriouſly conſidering her reaſons, and
finding much ſolidity in them, he altered his opinion, and found that all ſhe ſaid
proceeded from her affection to him: and therefore he returned her this anſwer:
That it was true, he ought to acquaint <hi>Adamas</hi> with his intention; That he did not
doubt but to find him a very good Father, as formerly he had upon all other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
That as for the conditions of <hi>Diana,</hi> It was meer folly to diſpute upon a
thing that was already reſolved: and that he could as well live without a ſoul, as live
happily without her; and that this did anſwer all thoſe conſiderations. That as for
the approbation of his Parents, he thought none of them did love him better then
he did himſelf, and that therefore he was obliged to ſatisfie and content himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Kindred or Friends. That as for the good Will and Affection of <hi>Diana;</hi>
It is true indeed, Siſter (ſaid he) I muſt ask your counſel upon that point; for you
being a woman as ſhe is, you may better judge of her intention then I, whoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
perhaps has diſturbed my judgement. I have ſeveral times attempted to know
her Will; and the laſt time ſhe was at the houſe of <hi>Adamas,</hi> when we walked ſo
long together, I complained unto her, that all my ſervices were ſo ill accepted, and
almoſt thrown away: unto which ſhe returned me an anſwer full of courteſie and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility:
And when I replied, that it was neither courteſie nor civility, but only Love
which I looked for from her; ſhe anſwered, That ſhe did honour me as much as any
man in the world, and loved me as well as any Siſter could love a Brother; and told
me; that this was all ſhe was able to do. But when I reply'd that my deſigne and
hopes was to marry her; ſhe anſwered me, that ſhe had Parents who had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53527:112"/>
of her, and ſhe alwayes referred ſuch things unto their diſcretions: But
<hi>Paris</hi> (ſaid ſhe) if you will know my mind, let me tell you, that, I do not intend to
marry, either you or any elſe; no nor ever will, I will alwayes love you as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but never as a Husband: upon this, Siſter, we were interrupted, and I would not
urge her any further, until I had your advice, how to behave my ſelf: I conjure
you therefore by the affection you have ever expreſſed towards me, to aſſiſt me:
for to think of diverting my affection to her, is meer folly, becauſe death only is
able to do it. Brother (ſaid <hi>Leonide</hi> and ſmiled) you ask my advice in a buſineſs,
which it ſeemes you are reſolved upon; but I beleeve your deſire is I ſhould tell
you, how you ſhould demean your ſelf to win the affection of this Shepherdeſſe:
and truly, ſince you are in ſuch an extremity as you ſay you are, I conceive your
beſt courſe is to obtain leave of her to ſpeak unto her Parents; for they, doubtleſſe
conſidering the advantage which will accrue unto <hi>Diana</hi> by it, will not be againſt
the propoſition: and ſhee who is very wiſe, and one that hath alwayes carried her
ſelf with abundance of prudence and virtue, ſhe dares not be againſt their opinion,
leaſt ſhe ſhould be thought either wilful or in love with ſome other, or elſe tax her
diſcretion: Thus may ſhe before ſhe be aware, engage her ſelf ſo far, that ſhe
cannot handſomly retire. But my opinion is, that your beſt way is, not to ſpeak
unto her untill the very day we depart from hence, to the end, that if you do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this leave, ſhe may not know where to find you, in caſe ſhe have a mind to
revoke it again, or at the leaſt not find you before you have made the overture unto
ſome of her Parents.</p>
                     <p>This was the opinion of <hi>Leonide,</hi> which <hi>Paris</hi> reſolved to follow; And whileſt
they were thus diſcourſing, <hi>Adamas</hi> and all the Company joyned with them. And
becauſe <hi>Sylvander</hi> was grown very bold, by the diſcourſe which he had heard, as
ſoon as all complements were paſſed, he addreſſed himſelf unto <hi>Diana:</hi> Miſtris,
(ſaid he aloud) I ſhall not refuſe the judgement of thoſe whom you appointed, ſo
you will but be pleaſed to do the like: you need not queſtion, (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) but I
ſhall conſent unto it, ſince I know my cauſe to be good, and made choice of my
Judges: The difference (replied <hi>Sylvander</hi>) needs not ſo much arguing, as that
betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and me; and therefore, I beſeech you, that without any more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
the matter may be judged. I ſhall never be againſt it (anſwered <hi>Diana</hi>) ſince
I hope for a decree to paſſe on my ſide. For my part, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I derive
all my right and title from the permiſſion which you gave me, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
my behaviour towards you always, as I did during the wager betwixt <hi>Phillis,</hi>
and me: How, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> did I ever permit you to continue alwayes ſo? Good
Shepherd, do you take one day, for alwayes? And yet I permitted you the reſt of
the day only, which being ended, you was not to make any more uſe of your fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I beſeech you Miſtris, (ſaid he) do you remember how you permitted me
to end that day which remained after the judgement, as I had begun it, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
my behaviour, as I did before? It is very true, (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) but that day is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and I have begun another. You had good reaſon, fair Shepherdeſſe, (ſaid he)
to ſay that you began another day; becauſe it is the quality of the Sun to begin and
limit days, and you are the Sun of all our Horizon; and therefore you cannot ſay,
that the day which you granted unto me is ended: For I beſeech you, faireſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris,
as long as the light continues, does not the day continue alſo? I confeſs it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Diana;</hi> but you muſt confeſs alſo, that when the Sun is ſet, and cannot be
ſeen, it is night. I do confeſſe it, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and thereupon I have gained
what I asked: for my ſoul and my eyes acknowledging no other Sun, but thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
rayes of your beauty, and perfection, moſt certainly as long as I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of this Light, and of this Sun, it is not night unto me: and ſince it is not
night, have I not good reaſon to ſay, that the day which you allowed me was not
ended; but on the contrary that it will laſt as long as I live, becauſe your beauty,
and your merits, will be alwayes in my ſoul? <hi>Diana</hi> a little ſurpriſed, or at leaſt
ſeemed ſo, returned this anſwer; I cannot deny, (ſaid ſhe) but that when you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
me leave for a day, you might mean ſuch a day as you ſpeak of: but I know
that the day which I granted, was only one of our natural days. Faireſt Miſtris,
(ſaid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) things that are ambiguous and doubtful, ought to be interpreted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53527:112"/>
to the advantage of the poor, and him that begs: Liberality and Generoſity, are
qualities ſo becoming a Noble ſoul, as I am confident, O my Judges, that you will
not diminiſh the leaſt of what is the fair <hi>Dianas</hi> due, <hi>Alexis</hi> ſmiled and ſaid, For
my part, under the favour of <hi>Astrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> I muſt needs condemn <hi>Diana,</hi>
and think <hi>Sylvander</hi> in the right; becauſe thoſe who give, ought to reſtrain and
explain their gifts, if they do not intend to give all that is asked: for otherwiſe it is
to be believed, it is in the ſame intention that he had who receives the benefit. Ah
me! cryed out <hi>Diana,</hi> I am afraid my cauſe will go againſt me: for I know <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
will accord unto all that <hi>Alexis</hi> thinks good; and <hi>Phillis</hi> will not contradict <hi>Aſtrea.</hi>
And I ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> do ordain, that if <hi>Sylvander</hi> do hereafter reſent the power of
a beauty in good earneſt, he ſhall not complain, neither of <hi>Diana</hi> nor his Judges,
but of himſelf only, who was the procurer of his own miſery, and that the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs
ſhall not be obliged by his ſervices to pity him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adamas</hi> ſaid this, becauſe he had a deſign to give <hi>Paris</hi> unto this Shepherdeſſe,
and ſeeing that <hi>Sylvander</hi> was not diſpleaſing unto her, he was afraid the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of this courtſhip ſhould ingage her more. But <hi>Sylvander</hi> ſeeming to take
no notice of what he ſaid, but kiſſing the hands of his Judges, he kneeled down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Diana;</hi> Faireſt Miſtris, ſaid he unto her, if ever any of my actions do contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
that vow, which I make of my faithful and perpetual ſervice, let me immediately
be condemned unto the moſt cruel torture, that ever mortal endured. <hi>Diana</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him, very faintly: Remember Shepherd ſaid ſhee, that you are permitted no
farther then to faign and diſſemble, and that I ſhall take all your actions only as
fictions and diſſimulations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sylvander</hi> had replied, had not <hi>Diana,</hi> and all the Company, entred into the
grove of Hazels, and there met <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> who at the ſame time were
coming to look them: and after they had walked a while, they all went together
into the houſe to dinner, where they found the Table furniſhed with many delicate
varieties, far above the rate of a Country Village.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lerindas,</hi> leaſt the Nimph <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſhould think him long, he made all the haſt
that poſſibly he could unto <hi>Mount-verdune.</hi> And being a good Footman, alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
deſirous to pleaſe his Lady, he made ſuch haſt, that he was there again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dinner. Madam, ſaid he unto her, <hi>Adamas</hi> cannot retard the ſacrifice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the people were already aſſembled; but becauſe I told him you were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to ſee the Shepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon,</hi> he ſends you word, that if you ſtay any
time here, he will bring them all hither. I am very ſorry, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that I
cannot ſhew this ſacrifice unto the Generous Damon, that he alſo might have ſeen
theſe fair Shepherdeſſes; but if <hi>Adamas</hi> keep his word, we ſhall ſee them as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
here; which if we do not, we cannot better imploy our time then in going
to their Town. Madam, anſwered <hi>Cleontine,</hi> ſince <hi>Adamas</hi> has ſaid it, you may
be aſſured he will doo't: Doubtleſs he will come before he return to his houſe, and
will be glad that all thoſe fair Shepherdeſſes ſhould accompany <hi>Alexis,</hi> when he
preſents her unto you. But as to <hi>Alexis</hi> (ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi> unto <hi>Lerindas</hi>) is ſhe as
full of beauty as they report her to be? For I know thou art a perſon of judgement,
and would be ſure to view her: Madam, ſhe is fair, anſwered he, but in my mind
there are three others which are fairer, and pleaſe me more; and ſince you ask
me, I had rather tel you ſo, then let <hi>Leonide</hi> have that advantage of me: I am of
opinion Madam, that if they were changed for your Nimphs, you would have the
faireſt women in the world to wait upon you. How <hi>Lerindus?</hi> (ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi>)
doſt thou think them fairer then my Nimphs? Then your Nimphs Madam? anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
he, Yes, yes, Fairer then all the Nimphs in the world. What <hi>Lerindas?</hi> (ſaid
<hi>Galathea</hi>) are they Fairer then I am? Ah Madam, (anſwered he, and was a little
ſurpriſed) I ſpeak not of you, for you are the Lady and Miſtris of all Nimphs; but
I ſay, that all others muſt yield unto them in beauty, for they are as much above
your Nimphs in beauty, as your Nimphs are above me. You ſhall ſee, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi>
that <hi>Lerindas</hi> is faln in love. Love (anſwered he with a diſdaining look) Nay, I
ſhould never fall in Love, with them, if they were as ſcornful as you. <hi>Galathea</hi>
then laughed extreamly; Certainly, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Silvia</hi> is in the right, <hi>Lerindas</hi> is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
in Love with one of theſe Shepherdeſſes: but which of the three does pleaſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53527:113"/>
the beſt? Stay a little Madam (anſwered he) I cannot upon a ſudden reſolve you:
The one has more Attracts, The other has more Modeſty, The third more Beauty:
The firſt is called <hi>Daphnide,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Diana,</hi> the third <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> I aſſure my ſelf
replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> that this <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is the faireſt, Is ſhe not <hi>Lerindas?</hi> Certainly ſhe
is, ſaid he, and <hi>Diana</hi> is more modeſt, and <hi>Daphnide</hi> more attractive. To tell you
truly, Attracts do much take me, Modeſty does much move me, but I love Beauty
beſt of all: And therefore I conclude, that if I be in Love, it muſt of neceſſity be
with <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Believe it Madam, when you ſee them, you will ſay that I am a man
of judgement; and <hi>Silara,</hi> as diſdainful as ſhe is, would be glad to change Beauty
with them. Then <hi>Galathea</hi> turned towards <hi>Cleontine,</hi> Mother ſaid ſhe unto her I
beſeech you what does <hi>Celidea</hi> think of theſe Shepherdeſſes? Madam, anſwered
<hi>Cleontine,</hi> always when ſhe begins to commend them, ſhe will never almoſt make an
end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo as you will think her in love with them as well as <hi>Lerindas:</hi> But indeed I
never heard her ſpeak of this <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and if you pleaſe, I will call <hi>Lerindas</hi> to
give you more particular ſatisfaction: And becauſe <hi>Galathea</hi> was very deſirous to
know all circumſtances concerning theſe Fair ones, ſhe called for him. But Mother,
ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Cleontine,</hi> I could wiſh you would ſend for <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lidea,</hi> that we might
have a full relation from her. Madam, ſaid <hi>Lerindas,</hi> and ſmiled, you will hardly
ſpeak with her this night it is ſo late; for I left her near the Temple of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> where ſhe was to offer a Sacrifice, and <hi>Thamires</hi> with her: But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſhe can tell you no more then I can, either concerning their Beauty, or any
thing elſe. If you deſire to know who this <hi>Daphnide</hi> is, I can tell you, ſhe is a
ſtranger, late come amongſt them, with one whoſe name is <hi>Alcidon:</hi> For though
I ſtayed not long amongſt them, yet ſeeing her ſo fair, I enquired who ſhe was. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(ſaid <hi>Cleontine</hi>) it will not be long before <hi>Celidea</hi> and <hi>Thamires</hi> will be here, and
then you may be better informed of all paſſages.</p>
                     <p>Thus did <hi>Galathea</hi> enquire of theſe fair Shepherdeſſes; and the more ſhe enquired
the reaſon ſhe thought <hi>Celadon</hi> had to love <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſince every one gave her ſuch a
high Character above others: And Dinner being done, ſhe went to viſit <hi>Damon,</hi>
who ſtirred not yet out of his chamber, becauſe his loſs of blood, and going ſo far
on foot in his Arms, had ſo wearied and weakned him, that he was conſtrained to
keep out of the Ayr, for fear of a further inconvenience. In the mean time <hi>Halla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi>
was come unto him, and never ſtirred from his Beds feet, but waited upon him
with ſo much care and vigilance, that <hi>Galathea</hi> did much eſteem him for it. It was
now the third day ſince he received his wounds; and the Nymph who thought her
ſelf much obliged unto the valour of this Cavalier, for being wounded in defence
of Ladies; moreover, being her Kinſman, and injured in her own Dominions and
preſence, ſhe reſolved never to leave him until he was perfectly recovered: And to
divert him a little, ſhe would have <hi>Lorindas</hi> relate in his preſence, all the paſſages of
his voyage.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the day ſpent, and when it was night, <hi>Celidea</hi> and <hi>Thamires</hi> returned,
<hi>Galathea</hi> would needs ſee them preſently; as well becauſe ſhe highly eſteemed that
Shepherdeſs, as becauſe ſhe deſired to know more particularly of thoſe Shepherdeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
whom ſhe had viſited. Come wiſe Shepherdeſs (ſaid ſhe unto her) tell us, I
beſeech you, the news of your Voyage. Madam, anſwered ſhe, we have done our
duties both unto God and man; for we have offered a ſacrifice of Thanks unto
<hi>Tautates</hi> for the Miſſetoe of the New Year; and we have done our duty unto <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
in viſiting his daughter <hi>Alexis:</hi> and I aſſure you, we are all very well ſatisfied.
For be pleaſed to know Madam, that <hi>Alexis</hi> is the moſt fair, moſt lovely, and moſt
courteous Lady that ever eye beheld; and has given ſuch contentment to us all, that
there is not one of us who does not even adore her: and <hi>Adamas</hi> has entertain'd
us beyond all expreſſion. As for the Sacrifice, the great <hi>Tautates</hi> has well accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of it; for all the victimes were as ſound and perfect as we could deſire: The
Miſſleto which we ſaw is ſo large and great, that we call it another Tree that is fixed
unto the Oak, ſo as our <hi>Druides</hi> have no reaſon to ſpare either us or our cattel this
year in our Sacrifices. But beſides this, we have alſo been highly delighted with the
Loves of <hi>Hylas</hi> who is the moſt pleaſant humored Shepherd that ever was; that
no diverſion could equal it: Alſo we heard the judgement of <hi>Diana</hi> upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53527:113"/>
between <hi>Sylvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis;</hi> And the preſence of <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
was no ſmall grace unto all the Aſſembly. Who is that <hi>Hylas</hi> of whom you
ſpeak, ſaid <hi>Galathea?</hi> He is a young man, anſwered <hi>Celidea,</hi> who falls in love with
all the Shepherdeſſes he meets, and maintains, that it is not inconſtancy, with ſuch
pleaſant arguments and quirks, as it is impoſſible to hear him and be ſad: For Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
he is not above twenty, or one and twenty years of age, and he reckoned up
above twenty with whom he had been in love, and moſt of them preſent; The laſt
he quitted was the fair and wiſe <hi>Alexis;</hi> and God knows for whom: I aſſure you
Madam it is not for a fairer, for he has made choiſe of <hi>Stella,</hi> one that is old enough,
and not comparable to the fair <hi>Druide</hi> in point of Beauty.</p>
                     <p>But I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> Does the daughter of <hi>Adamas</hi> ſuffer him to
ſerve her, and before the eyes of every one? Yes Madam, anſwered <hi>Celidea,</hi> but
I aſſure you, without any ſcandal; and if you ſaw her, you would ſay as much:
There is not the daughter of any <hi>Druide</hi> whom he does not Court. Nay Madam,
I am confident that if he had the honour to ſee you, neither you, nor any of your
Nymphs would eſcape his Courtſhip; for he would expreſs his mind at the very
firſt. But what is the judgement of <hi>Diana,</hi> replied <hi>Galathea.</hi> Madam, anſwered
the Shepherdeſs, It hapned upon a time that <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Sylvander</hi> were in a hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
which of them had moſt merits to make themſelves loved: For <hi>Sylvander,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be as well a qualified Shepherd, as any in all the Country, yet did he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
love any particularly, nor was loved: And becauſe <hi>Phillis</hi> did upbraid him that
reaſon was his want of courage and merit, and <hi>Sylvander</hi> ſaid as much by her, they
were both of them condemned by the company to Court <hi>Diana,</hi> and at three months
end, ſhe was to judge which of them won the wager. Doubtleſs, ſaid <hi>Damon, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
would adjudge it on the womans ſide. Her judgement, anſwered <hi>Celidea,</hi> is
ſomthing doubtful: She adjudged <hi>Phillis</hi> to be more amiable then <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and
that <hi>Sylvander</hi> knew better how to make himſelf loved then <hi>Phillis</hi> did. Certainly
(ſaid <hi>Damon</hi>) <hi>Diana</hi> is a very diſcreet and wiſe Shepherdeſs; for I ſee ſhe had a mind
to content both; and ſhe has done it with much diſcretion. But Madam, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he, and turned towards <hi>Galathea,</hi> you have not yet asked her who that <hi>Daphnide</hi>
is? I heard <hi>Lerindas</hi> ſay, ſhe was one of the faireſt of all the Shepherdeſſes, and I
would gladly know who ſhe and <hi>Alcidon</hi> is, for ſome reſpects which afterwards I
ſhall tell you. Then <hi>Thamires</hi> began to ſpeak; Sir, ſaid he unto <hi>Damon, Lerindas</hi>
was in the right to ſay ſhe was fair, for indeed ſhe is ſo; but he was in the wrong
in ſaying ſhe was a Shepherdeſs; for ſhe is not ſo, but only to diſguiſe her ſelf, does
wear the habit of a Shepherdeſs: We underſtood by <hi>Hylas</hi> that <hi>Daphnide</hi> is one of
the greateſt Ladies in the Province of the Romans, and <hi>Alcidon</hi> the greateſt Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of King <hi>Euriche,</hi> and that they came into this Country out of curioſity to ſee
the Fountain of <hi>Loves Verity.</hi> It is enough (ſaid <hi>Damon</hi>) and then turning tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
<hi>Galathea,</hi> Madam, ſaid he unto her, you muſt by all means ſee theſe two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and be acquainted with them, for <hi>Daphnide</hi> is one of the faireſt of all the <hi>Gallo-Ligurians,</hi>
and was highly loved by King <hi>Guricke,</hi> ſo as had he lived, ſhe had been
his Queen: As for <hi>Alcidon,</hi> I ſhall commend him unto you, Madam, for the moſt
accompliſhed Cavalier in the Court of <hi>Thoriſmond;</hi> and I ſaw him ſo careſſed and
loved by that King, as he could not give demonſtrations enough of his good will
towards him. I could relate many things worthy of knowledge, but ſince he is ſo
near you, it is better you know them from his mouth then from mine. <hi>Damon</hi> then
began to whiſper with the Nymph, which cauſed <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Celidea</hi> to remove a
little further diſtant, But Madam (ſaid <hi>Damon</hi> unto her) Is the face of this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs
thus ſpoiled with cutting? She ſeems to be very wiſe and diſcreet, how came
this misfortune to paſs? Theſe cuts in her face, anſwered <hi>Galathea,</hi> are the moſt
glorious marks that ever woman wore: thereupon ſhe related the whole ſtory, and
how happily her deſigne proſpered ſince the fond affection of <hi>Calidon</hi> was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
and the perfect Love of <hi>Thamires</hi> augmented by it, ſo as never was any
more tenderly loved then ſhe is now in her deformity. <hi>Damon</hi> admired the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this young woman, eſpecially in a Shepherdeſs, becauſe ſuch generoſity is
ſeldom but amongſt higher and more noble ſpirits. You are miſtaken, Sir, ſaid the
Nymph, The Shepherds of this Country are not Shepherds of neceſſity, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53527:114"/>
to keep their flocks, for a livelyhood, but have made choice of this kind of
life, purpoſely to enjoy more tranquillity, and live at eaſe: for the truth is, they are
of kin and allied unto the greateſt Nobility in all our Dominions. Madam, anſwered
<hi>Damon,</hi> although the ſcars in this womans face, were made with the point of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
yet I do know one that can moſt certainly cure them, provided ſhe have ſo
ſo much courage, as to do what is requiſite thereto: As for her courage, replied
<hi>Galathea,</hi> you need not doubt ſo much as her will. How? (replied he and was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
has ſhe no will to become fair? Truly, I believe, ſhe is the only woman in the
world who is of that opinion. Call her, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> and you ſhall ſee what ſhe
will ſay. Upon which he calling her by her name; ſhe came to know what <hi>Galathea</hi>
would be pleaſed to command her. <hi>Celidea,</hi> ſaid the Nimph, here is a Cavalier who
pittying the miſ-fortune of your face, and inquiring how it came to paſs, does ſay
that moſt certainly he can get you cured, and make you as fair as ever you were, if
you pleaſe. Shepherdeſſe, ſaid <hi>Damon,</hi> It is moſt undoubtedly true, for when I
was in <hi>Africa,</hi> one of Eudoxes women was wounded in her face with a Diamond,
and ſo deep that the bone in her cheek did almoſt appear; yet there was a skilful
Chirurgion, who wetting a little ſtick with her blood, did dreſſe the ſtick with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
called the <hi>Sympathy Salve,</hi> and ſo cured her againſt the opinion of all the
world. And becauſe I thought this cure to be very rare; I was ſo full of curioſity,
as to ask ſome of the Salve; but he anſwered me, that it was a thing which he could
not give unto any, becauſe he was obliged to it by oath: but that whenſoever I had
any need, if I would but ſent unto him a little piece of wood, bloodyed in the wound,
he would preſently work the cure, though he were a thouſand miles diſtant, if I
would only keep the wound clean: Therefore Shepherdeſs, if you would be cured,
you need only but ſcratch the wound, ſo as blood may run a little, and you ſhall ſee
you will recover your former beauty.</p>
                     <p>Sir, anſwered <hi>Celidea,</hi> your kindneſs, and the care you have of my face, obliges
me very much unto you for it: but give me leave to tell you, that this beauty, which
you are pleaſed to ſpeak of, is at this time a thing ſo indifferent unto me, as if I could
recover it again by going to the door, I ſhould hardly ſtir a foot that way, if there
was any other way out of the houſe. When I call to memory, what abundance of
trouble, and importunity, it cauſed me, I aſſure you Sir, I would rather go out at
the window then that way, or have any correſpondency with it again. Surely,
ſaid <hi>Damon,</hi> all women have a particular deſire to be fair, or at the leaſt not to be
deformed. Thoſe who are ſo eager after beauty, replied <hi>Celidea,</hi> perhaps have
ſome deſigns to procure the Love of ſome whoſe amity they deſire. But for my
part, I do proteſt unto you Sir, that I deſire to be fair only in the eyes of <hi>Thamires,</hi>
and if I would, make my ſelf inviſible to any elſe. Me thinks yet, replied <hi>Damon,</hi>
you ſhould deſire that <hi>Thamires</hi> ſhould ſee you fair. It is very true, replied ſhe,
but I believe theſe ſcars in my face do ſeem as fair unto him, as all beauty, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of Features can be ſince they came unto me only for his ſake. This conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
replied the Nimph, may make him have a great opinion of your affection,
goodneſs, and virtue; but perhaps he deſires you were fair, as well as virtuous. For
my part, Sir, replied <hi>Celidea,</hi> I am ſo very well contented, and ſatisfied, with being
as I am, that I think I ſhould offend <hi>Tautates,</hi> ſhould I deſire to be better: yet if
<hi>Thamires</hi> do deſire to have it ſo, I am moſt ready to do whatſoever is his pleaſure.
Deareſt, ſaid <hi>Thamires,</hi> were you never ſo fair, moſt certainly I could not Love you
better then I do, as you are: But I muſt needs confeſſe, that if I thought it were
poſſible to reſtore you unto your former beauty, I would ſpare no paines, or coſt,
to procure it; for I am obliged unto it, and ſhould think my ſelf moſt ungreatfull,
if I did not: and therefore Sir, ſaid he to <hi>Damon,</hi> if you know of any remedy, I
beſeech you, acquaint me with it, and I ſhall think my ſelf eternally obliged unto
you for it. Moſt certainly, ſaid <hi>Damon,</hi> ſhe will be cured, and without much
pain; for I have ſeen the experience of it. A little ſtick muſt be wet in the blood
of the wounds, and carried unto the place which I ſhall direct very carefully; you
will not be above twelve or fifteen daies in going, and I will write unto a Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who queſtionleſs will preſently work the cure: Now did <hi>Celidea</hi> hate the very
thought of this beauty ſince, for the gaining of it, ſhe was to be ſo long deprived
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53527:114"/>
of her deareſt <hi>Thamires:</hi> Oh Heavens! ſaid ſhe, with teares in her eyes, did I take
ſo much paines to deprive my ſelf of this beauty, to buy it now again at ſo dear a
rate? Ah <hi>Thamires!</hi> content your ſelf with your <hi>Celidea</hi> as ſhe is; and do not run
your ſelf into ſo much hazard of loſing her for ever. For if you go ſo far into a
ſtrange Country from her, grief perhaps may bring her to her grave, before your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
becauſe ſhe is not able to be ſo long abſent from you. Haſt thou not told me, a
hundred times <hi>Thamires,</hi> that thou couldſt live with me as I am, the happieſt Shepherd
in the World? And what, dear <hi>Thamires,</hi> needs more? Wouldſt thou be better
then happy? No, no, the joy of my life, enjoy that happineſs which Heaven has
given thee, and ſtrive for no more then thou art like to obtain; content thy ſelf
with what the Gods have thought good for thee to be contented with: If it be for
my ſake, deareſt <hi>Thamires,</hi> you deſire this beauty, believe it, that your abſence is
ſo odious to me, as I had rather die then be deprived of you one week; the journey
I perceive is ſo long, ſo full of danger, that I cannot conſent unto it: you are to
go amongſt the Barbarians, perhaps he unto whom you go, is dead: who knows
whether his receipt be proper to cure me? Perhaps it has his right upon another,
but I am confident the wound which this Cavalier ſpeaks of, was made by ſome
piece of glaſſe, or ſome other counterfeit ſtone, and not with a right Diamond:
the wound he ſpeaks of was dreſſed, and the receipt applied unto it, as ſoon as it
was made, but mine is old, and out of all hopes to be helped. But ſuppoſe it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
I may recover this ſo much deſpiſed beauty, by the torments which you will put
me unto, and which at beſt is but doubtful: yet <hi>Thamires,</hi> ſince I do not value it,
and ſince it is only to procure your ſelf a little more contentment; will you buy
that contentment at a price which is ſo dear unto me? In the firſt place, you muſt
carry my blood, but alas! the blood is nothing; I would give it all to keep you with
me: but Oh? how many tears will your abſence cauſe? What ſighs? What ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows?
What mortal diſpleaſures ſhall I have in this ſad ſeparation? Oh <hi>Thamires!</hi>
didſt thou know how thou wilt torment thy <hi>Celidea</hi> by it? I cannot think, that for
ſuch a fading thing as this beauty, thou would be ſo long from her. When all is
done, <hi>Thamires,</hi> when after a long and weariſome journey, ful of dangers, thou haſt
brought back with thee this beauty, what will it avail thee Shepherd, if a Feaver, or
ſickneſs, or ſorrow, or the happineſs of a child bearing, ſhould take it away again?
But admit, it do eſcape all <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ese has not time wings? Will not age creep on a pace,
and raviſh away this fading flower, almoſt as ſoon as thou art returned? <hi>Celidea</hi>
tears did ſo accompany her words, that <hi>Damon</hi> was moved unto much compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Wiſe and diſcreet Shepherdeſs (ſaid he) your virtue makes you admirable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all thoſe who know you, and obliges every one to ſerve you, not only upon this
occaſion, but in all other. I muſt confeſſe you have reaſon to deſire the preſence
of <hi>Thamires;</hi> but me thinks you might well diſpence with him upon ſuch an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet to ſatisfie you both, I will promiſe to bring this Chirurgion hither ere it be
long, and he ſhall cure your face without parting you from your dearly beloved
Shepherd. Oh Sir! ſaid <hi>Celidon,</hi> if you will do this favour for a poor Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs,
the great <hi>Tautates</hi> will reward you, for I ſhall never be able; but I will pray
for your happineſs as long as I live.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Damon</hi> admired the virtue and affection of this Shepherdeſſe, aſſured her, that
<hi>Thamires</hi> ſhould not be put unto the trouble of parting from her: And it being late,
the Nimph retired with a reſolution to offer her ſacrifice the next morning, and the
day after to ſee theſe Shepherdeſſes: conceiving that <hi>Damon</hi> would be in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſtir abroad, and by his means, ſhe would try if ſhe could bring back <hi>Daphnide</hi>
and <hi>Alcidon</hi> with her, that ſhe might do them all the honour their merits deſerved;
and having made her deſign known unto <hi>Damon,</hi> he prepared himſelf, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
deſire to know what his Fortune would be: The morning being come, and
all things ready for the ſacrifice, <hi>Cleontine</hi> put upon her head a Chaplet of Flowers,
girded her ſelf about with Vervine, took a branch of Miſsleto in her hand, cauſed
the fire to be kindled, and after the white Buls were ſacrificed, ſhe ſprinkled her
ſelf with ſome of the blood, afterwards ſhe ſprinkled ſome upon the Nimph, and
then upon <hi>Damon:</hi> Then throwing the Savine, the Miſſleto, and the Vervine into
the Fire, ſhe ran to the Vault of <hi>Bellinus,</hi> and touching the Lock with the Branch of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53527:115"/>
Miſſleto, the door flew open with a great noiſe, and ſhe leaning her ſelf as far into
the Cave as ſhe could, ſhe received the Wind which with a kind of murmuring voice
came out of the Cave: Then, as if inſpired with Enthuſiaſtique Rapture, ſhe ran
unto the place where the Sacrifice was offered, which was in a little Grove near the
Temple, according to the ancient Cuſtome; There ſhe found the Nymph and the
Cavalier upon their knees, expecting the anſwer of <hi>Bellinus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then laying one hand upon the Altar, and holding the branch of Miſſleto in the
other, with ſtaring eyes, diſordered hair, and trembling hands and head, ſhe utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a voice far different from what it was wont to be, in theſe words.</p>

                     <p>The Nymph and the Cavalier having received this Oracle, they ſtudied a long
while upon it; but it being impoſſible for them to underſtand it perfectly, one of
the ancient Prieſts who was preſent, and who was accuſtomed to interpret ſuch am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous

                     <p>Oracles, which are the words of the great Gods, are ordinarily rendred very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure;
becauſe future things ought to be concealed from Humanes: For did we
know the hour of our death, we ſhould not reliſh the ſweets of life, but live as if
we were going to our graves. Great <hi>Tautates,</hi> who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for us to know, that we may have a dependency upon him. The great <hi>Tauta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
does foretel you, that ere long you ſhall ſee your errour, and your ſin; and this
in words ſo clear, that nothing can be more manifeſt: Alſo to ſhew, that he does

                        </gap>e foreſees is to fall upon
you, he does advertiſe you of it betimes, to the end you may prudently prevent it,
or patiently receive it: Furthermore, I muſt needs tell you, That by the corrupt
Intralls, and blood of all the Sacrifices which we have offered, we expect ſome
ſtrange accident ready to fall upon our heads: For the Victims do fall all upon the
left ſide, and when they did fall, did beat themſelves extreamly upon the ground,
and died very impatiently; their blood would hardly come out, and was defective
both in quality and quantity: and as for their Intralls, their Hearts and their Livers
were rotten. To be brief, we ſee ſo many apparent ſignes from heaven, that it is
manifeſt unleſs we do appeaſe the great <hi>Tautates</hi> by humble and fervent Prayers, we
muſt expect ſome heavie judgements ready to fall upon us.</p>
                     <p>As for the Oracle which is rendred unto you, O valiant <hi>Cavalier,</hi> you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
great contentment from it, for it ſpeaks good unto you: In being called from
death to life, is to be underſtood your coming out of ſome eminent danger; Death
ſignifies ſome deep diſpleaſure out of which you are ere long to be releaſed by the
aſſiſtance of him whom you ſcorn and hate: And therefore Madam, and you ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Cavalier, it is your parts to render thanks unto <hi>Bellinus,</hi> for the favour he hath
done you both, to the end your gratitude may oblige him to continue his goodneſs
ſtill unto you.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſpake the Prieſt: And both the Nymph and the Cavalier upon their knees
ſeemed to be very devout towards heaven, by many actions of thanks: Afterwards
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53527:115"/>
retired to their Lodgings, with intention to go the next day unto the Temple of the
good Goddeſs; and afterwards in their return to ſee the Shepherdeſs of <hi>Lignon,</hi>
with <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> though <hi>Damon</hi>'s intention was to make himſelf as little
known unto them as he could, intending to ſtay amongſt them a few days, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
if he found no remedy againſt his diſpleaſures, to go ſo far away, that he
ſhould not hear either <hi>Aquitain,</hi> or any he knew ſpoken of. Being ſet down at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
therefore, with this reſolution, and Dinner being almoſt done, the Nymph ſaw
enter into the Room a Cavalier from <hi>Amaſis,</hi> who was in great favour and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with her. This Cavalier (after all due reverence) came unto her, and told her
in her ear, That he had great matters to impart unto her from <hi>Amaſis,</hi> but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of it would be long, and fit to be kept in ſecret, and therefore he would ſpeak
no more of it, until ſhe commanded him to wait upon her in private. The Nymph
hearing this, and ſeeing his face in a kind of confuſion, ſhe began to think upon
what the Prieſt told her concerning the defects in the Victims: And not being able
to think upon any greater misfortune then the loſs of her Mother, ſhe asked him
aloud how <hi>Amaſis</hi> did? Madam, anſwered he, thanks be to heaven ſhe is in good
health, and does paſſionately deſire to ſee you, thinking every hour an age you are
abſent from her. We will wait upon her preſently, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſince <hi>Damon</hi> is
in a condition to ride; for it was not reaſonable to leave him in a ſick condition, ſince
he received his wounds by defending us againſt the injuries of <hi>Argenteus.</hi> Upon this
ſhe retired preſently into her chamber, and cauſed the Cavalier to be called. Has my
Mother (ſaid the Nymph unto him,) received any News from the Army of the
<hi>Francks?</hi> And does ſhe hear how <hi>Clidemant</hi> does? Madam (anſwered the Cavalier)
ſhe did receive ſome news this morning, which is not very good, but ſhe deſires to
communicate it her ſelf unto you, and would have you make all the haſte you can
unto her: She commanded me to let you underſtand, that the <hi>Francks</hi> have been
in great Tumult upon King <hi>Childerick;</hi> who was forced to retire into <hi>Thurin;</hi> I am
afraid that this was not without great bloodſhed, and you know <hi>Clidemant, Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
and <hi>Gayamant</hi> were always with him, I beſeech God no misfortune have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln
them. I can aſſure you of one thing, Madam, That <hi>Amaſis</hi> your Mother is
very ſad, and much troubled, and extreamly deſires to ſpeak with you. Friend, ſaid
<hi>Galathea,</hi> your diſcourſe does much amaze me, and I wiſh either that I knew not ſo
much, or that I knew more: I muſt before I ſend you away, talk a little with the
ſage <hi>Cleontine,</hi> and with <hi>Damon,</hi> who is a perſon which may be very ſerviceable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us in ſuch accidents as may happen; and cauſing them to be both called, ſhe
acquainted them how <hi>Amaſis</hi> had ſent for her: And becauſe ſhe knew not whether
ſhe ſhould return preſently, or firſt go unto <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> to offer ſome prayers there,
as the Oracle did wiſh her, ſhe asked the opinion of the old <hi>Cleontine;</hi> who anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her thus: I conceive Madam, that in all our affairs we ſhould have recourſe unto
<hi>Tautates,</hi> and you eſpecially, ſince by the relation of the Prieſt, you are menaced
with ſome great misfortune; and to divert it, the beſt remedy is to have recourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, from whom all proceeds, and to beſeech him he would with hold his chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
hand. And therefore my opinion is, your beſt courſe is to go unto the good
Goddeſs, offer your ſacrifice unto her, and the ſame day go into <hi>Marcelles. Damon</hi>
was of the ſame opinion. You hear (ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi> unto the Cavalier which <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
ſent) what the opinion of <hi>Cleontine</hi> and <hi>Damon</hi> is; Aſſure <hi>Amaſis,</hi> that to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
I will wait upon her, and in the mean time, will pray unto the great <hi>Tautates,</hi>
for a bleſſing upon us all.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Cavalier went away, leaving <hi>Galathea</hi> in ſuch a perplexity, as ſhe had no
mind to ſee the fair Shepherdeſſes, or <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> but reſolved to depart
the next morning betimes: which being come, <hi>Damon</hi> armed himſelf according to
his cuſtome; and having put <hi>Galathea</hi> and her Nymphs into their Coaches, he
mounted a Horſe which the Nymph gave unto him, and which was one of <hi>Clidemants</hi>
her Brothers. This Cavalier appeared ſo gallant in the eyes of <hi>Galathea,</hi> that he
put her in mind of the generous <hi>Lindamore;</hi> and paſſing from one thought unto
another, ſhe imagined that the news perhaps that <hi>Amaſis</hi> would tell her, was of that
Cavaliers death; and then ſhe plotted how to get <hi>Polimas</hi> to go in his room, as well
to pack him further from her, and be rid of his importunity, as in hopes that <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:53527:116"/>
would caſt her eyes upon <hi>Damon,</hi> in caſe <hi>Lindamore</hi> was dead: and yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
his actions and glory he had gotten in this voyage, together with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he had born unto her, ſhe could not chuſe but lament the loſſe of him; and in
caſe he was not dead, and that ſhe could be convinced of the impoſture of <hi>Cleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this,</hi>
then to have ſome advantagious thoughts of him. Theſe thoughts entertained her
a great part of the way to <hi>Bonlieu:</hi> But paſſing over the river of <hi>Lignon,</hi> ſhe began to
think upon <hi>Daphnide, Alcidon,</hi> and all thoſe Shepherdeſſes whom ſhe intended to
ſee: but being unwilling that this ſtranger Lady ſhould go away, and ſhee not ſee
her, ſhe ſent unto the ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> to deſire him he would come to her unto
<hi>Bonlieu,</hi> and in caſe ſhe was gone before he came, to follow her unto <hi>Marſellis,</hi>
and that he would infinitely oblige her, if he would bring <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi>
with him: Afterwards, ſhe arrived at the Temple of the good Goddeſs, where the
venerable <hi>Chriſante</hi> received them with all honour and civility; and becauſe the
Nymph acquainted her with her haſt unto <hi>Marſelles, Chriſante</hi> cauſed all poſſible
haſt to be made with the ſacrifice, telling her that the Victimes which was offered
for the publique and the happy voyage of <hi>Clidamant,</hi> were found ſo defective, as
it was evident ſome great diſaſter was towards.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who had obtained that permiſſion which he
deſired, he was ſo intent and buſie in it, as he had forgotten to tell <hi>Madonthe</hi> and
<hi>Therſander,</hi> that there was a Cavalier in queſt of them, with many terrible mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and threats; and had he not accidentally met them one morning, as they were
walking to take the ayr, certainly it had been long before they had been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it; for he was ſo much taken up with his paſſion, as he had no room in his
ſoul for any other thought: But meeting them ſo opportunely, he acquainted them
with all that <hi>Paris</hi> told him, and the danger which they had incurred, if they had
met with that Barbarous Man, who ſought for them with ſo much deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
<hi>Madonthe</hi> did thank him for the intelligence; and having long debated
amongſt themſelves, who it ſhould be, they could not imagine it could be <hi>Damon,</hi>
becauſe he was dead in their belief: but rather that it was ſome of <hi>Madonthis</hi> kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
who not being able to ſuffer her flight away with <hi>Therſander,</hi> did ſeek to he
revenged upon him. <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who alwayes carried much good will unto <hi>Madon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi>
both becauſe of her reſemblance unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and becauſe ſhe was very vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and modeſt, ſeeing her ſhed abundance of tears, he had much compaſſion of her,
and asked her the cauſe of them. Oh Shepherd! ſaid ſhe unto him, have I not great
reaſon to lament my miſerable Fortune, which thus cruelly torments me? Was it not
enough, and too much, to perſecute me in my own Country, and amongſt my friends,
but I muſt be alſo tormented here, where I hoped to find reſt and tranquility. O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!
O Gods! What crime have I committed lately, that after I had forſaken my
Country, my eſtate, and all my acquaintance, I ſhould be purſued ſtil, &amp; find no hopes
of any reſt, but in my Grave. Upon theſe words, her tears did flow in ſuch abundance,
as ſhe was conſtrained unto ſilence, and to have recourſe unto her handkerchief.
<hi>Sylvander</hi> who was moved when ſhe began her tears, was moved much more at
her continuance of them, and offered to guard and defend her from all injuries this
ſtranger could do her, by the aſſiſtance of his friends, if ſhe would ſtay in the
Country. As ill luck was, <hi>Laonice</hi> meeting them at the ſame time, and being very
familiar with <hi>Madonthe,</hi> ſhe adviſed her to retire into her own Country, where
ſhe might live more quietly, and not to refuſe the aſſiſtance of <hi>Sylvander</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
her, at the leaſt as far as Forreſts reached. <hi>Madonthe</hi> fearing to receive ſome
burt for this ſtranger, ſhe reſolved to be gone, and accept of <hi>Sylvanders</hi> offer, to
guard her with his friends: But <hi>Therſander</hi> was much againſt it, and diſſwaded her;
ſo as ſhe thanked <hi>Sylvander</hi> for his good will, and would not permit him to go any
farther then the place where this ſtranger was ſeen: Then preſently at the ſame hour,
after ſhe had taken leave of ſome Shepherdeſſes, which ſhe met with by chance, ſhe
deſired <hi>Laonice</hi> to excuſe her unto the reſt, ſhe ſet forward with a reſolution as ſoon
as ſhe came into <hi>Aquitane,</hi> to admit her ſelf amongſt the Veſtals, or the <hi>Drui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>es</hi>
daughters, and forſake the world and all its adventures.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Alexis</hi> lived freely with the fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and made uſe of all
the Priviledges, which the daughter of <hi>Adamas</hi> could have, and had been two dayes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53527:116"/>
in her own Town amongſt the Shepherdeſſes and Shepherds, and was never out of
<hi>Aſtreas</hi> ſight but when ſhe was in bed; for all the day they talked together, and
were all the night in a chamber, where their beds were not far diſtant: and the
impatient Love of <hi>Alexis</hi> not permitting her to ſleep; ſhe aroſe the ſecond mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to contemplate upon the beauty of her fair Shepherdeſs, before it was perfect
light, and put on <hi>Aſtreas</hi> Gown in ſtead of her own; and ſhe took ſuch extream
delight to be in that Gown, which covered the body of her deareſt Saint, that ſhe
took the reſt of <hi>Aſtreas</hi> Clothes, and trimmed her ſelf compleatly in the habit of a
Shepherdeſs, ſo as any one would have taken her for one: and though <hi>Aſtreas</hi>
Gown was a little too ſtrait for her, yet it was not ſo unſit, but it might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the eye of any that was not too ſtrict an obſerver: being thus decked, ſhe
went unto the bed where <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was aſleep, and kneeling down, ſhe began to adore,
and contemplate upon her beauty as ſhe ſlept.</p>
                     <p>And though <hi>Alexis</hi> uttered many raptures in a loud voice, yet none of the three
awaked: <hi>Alexis</hi> ſtill looked upon <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and the more ſhe looked, the more ſhe
Loved: And being tranſported with her affection, ſhe went neer her to ſteal an
amorous kiſſe, but preſently checked her ſelf, out of her reſpect. But ſtill having a
longing deſire unto it, ſhe uttered ſome verſes in a lone voice, upon this ſubject;
That her Miſtris ſlept, and ſhe durſt not kiſs her; and perhaps ſhe had grown a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more couragious, if <hi>Leonide</hi> by fortune had not waked, and perhaps again <hi>Alexis</hi>
was ſo loud in her expreſſion, as ſhe was the cauſe of it. As ſoon as ſhe opened her
eyes, ſhe took her for <hi>Phillis,</hi> and bidding her good morrow, asked her, why ſhe
was ſo early: <hi>Alexis</hi> ſmiled, and returning no anſwer, covered her face with her
hand, purpoſely to keep her the longer in her miſtake: <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> waking
at the ſame time, they were both deceived as well as <hi>Leonide,</hi> both of them ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her, and asked the ſame queſtion which the Nimph did, <hi>Alexis</hi> ſeeing all thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
ſhe grew more confident then when they were aſleep, and going unto <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
kiſſed her cheek, &amp; bad her good morrow. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> hearing a voice unlike unto <hi>Phillis,</hi>
pulled back her cheek, and looking a little better upon her, ſhe knew her. Am I
miſtaken, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> or do I ſee <hi>Alexis</hi> in the habit of a Shepherdeſs? Upon this,
<hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> looking alſo better upon her, they knewher to be <hi>Alexis</hi> indeed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſtrea</hi> then, raiſed her ſelf up a little in her bed, and taking <hi>Alexis</hi> in her arms,
kiſſed her, with abundance of joy, to ſee her in her clothes. Give me leave, new
Shepherdeſs, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> to kiſs you; and give me leave alſo to tell you moſt truly,
That <hi>Forreſts</hi> never ſaw ſo Fair a Shepherdeſs.</p>
                     <p>Then all three looking upon her with admiration, they were all raviſhed to ſee
her ſo Fair in that unaccuſtomed habit: <hi>Alexis</hi> all this while, ſaid nothing; but at
laſt, when ſhe ſaw that ſhe was known, Siſter, ſaid ſhe unto the Nymph, do you
not think, that theſe clothes have not changed for the worſe? I do think (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Nymph) that you are a Fairer Shepherdeſs then a <hi>Druide;</hi> and that if <hi>Hylas</hi>
ſaw you, he would preſently lay by a new ſtock of Love, to ſpend in your ſervice.
And I think, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that theſe clothes, could they be ſenſible of it, would be
infinitely happy, in being worn by the Faireſt that ever lived. But (ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and
interrupted) it were pity to put this Fair <hi>Druide</hi> unto ſo much paines as to
undreſſe her ſelf, and therefore it would be better, if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> took thoſe
of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and wear them all the day: I am confident it would be an excellent
mask unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> and he would certainly take the one for the other: Truly, ſaid
<hi>Leonide,</hi> I dare venture a wager, that moſt of thoſe who ſee them, miſtake them;
eſpecially if my ſiſters clothes were as fit for <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> as <hi>Aſtreas</hi> are for her. <hi>Alexis,</hi>
thinking it an happineſs to be in thoſe clothes, which uſed to cover the body of her
Faireſt Miſtris, had a great deſire to wear them all the day. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> who did paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
Love this <hi>Druide,</hi> had alſo a moſt extream deſire to wear the clothes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis;</hi>
and yet, neither of them, durſt publiſh their deſires. And becauſe <hi>Diana</hi>
was very earneſt with them to have it ſo. But ſiſter, ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi> unto <hi>Leonide,</hi> what
will my Father ſay when he ſees me in ſuch a diſguiſe? What will he ſay? anſwered
<hi>Leonide;</hi> he will laugh, and be very glad to ſee you in ſuch a merry humour: he
knows that nothing is more prejudicial to your health then melancholy and ſadneſſe:
and thinks nothing more conducible to your health, then jollity, and mirth. Could
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53527:117"/>
I believe, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> that I ſhould delude the eyes of thoſe who ſhall ſee me
this day, as well as I was deluded in the choice of my clothes, I ſhould be glad:
For though there was much difference between our clothes, yet I took <hi>Aſtreas</hi> for
my own, and yet I ſee you miſtook me: Believe it, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> one would believe,
you took much paines in dreſſing your ſelf, for it is impoſſible you ſhould be better
dreſſed; and as for me, I will take ſome other clothes, to make it the more belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that you are a new come Shepherdeſs, No, no, (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) you muſt needs
take the <hi>Druides</hi> clothes: otherwiſe, what will they think is become of her? We will
ſay, anſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> that my ſiſter is not well, upon condition <hi>Aſtrea</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to take her clothes to morrow, that we may ſee whether ſhe will be as fine a
<hi>Druide,</hi> as my ſiſter is a Shepherdeſs. I ſhall do as you deſire, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but
I believe her Gown will be too big for me. As much, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> as yours is too
little for me; but both may be eaſily helped. Since Madam it is your pleaſure to have
it ſo, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I ſhall be the <hi>Druide</hi> to morrow: but I am confident, that if
<hi>Hylas</hi> ſaw this new come Shepherdeſſe to day, he would burn all his Artieles of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with <hi>Stella,</hi> and add this Fair Stranger unto the great number of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſes:
I am ſure, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that neither he nor any elſe can ſee you, but
both he and all muſt needs Love you.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe now it began to grow late, and full time for theſe Fair Ones to
riſe; <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was conſtrained to riſe out of the bed in her ſmock, to fetch another
Gown, and other Linnen, which were in a Trunk at the other end of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and thinking none in the room but Women, ſhe aroſe very confidently, and
careleſly.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing the diſguiſed <hi>Druide</hi> ſaw, was her bare Foot, and Leg; and half
her Thigh: The delicacy, and whiteneſs of her Feet, the handſome proportion of
her Leg, the plumpneſs of her Thygh, and the beauty of her Neck, could not be
equalled by any things, but themſelves: And <hi>Alexis</hi> ſtood in ſuch a poſture of
amazement as ſhe looked upon her, as invited <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> to take her in her arms and
kiſs her: The embraces of <hi>Alexis</hi> might well have raiſed a ſuſpicion, that they were
a little more affectionate and cloſe, then ſuch as women uſe: And <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was as
zealous in her imbraces, as <hi>Alexis</hi> was, and perhaps received them, not as the
kiſſes of an <hi>Alexis,</hi> but as the living reſemblance of <hi>Celadon. Leonide</hi> obſerving
theſe amorous kiſſes and careſſes, and growing a little jealous, ſhe ſaid unto the
<hi>Druide:</hi> Take heed, new Shepherdeſs, leſt holding <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſo long in your arms,
you cauſe her to take cold. No, no, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> I cannot take any harm in
being ſo neer <hi>Alexis,</hi> I ſhould be very ſorry Faireſt (ſaid the <hi>Druide</hi>) to be the
cauſe of any inconveniency to you, but I hope my ſiſter ſpeaks only out of envy:
then <hi>Alexis</hi> took <hi>Aſtrea</hi> in her arms from off the ground, and carried her to the
Trunk, unto which ſhe was going; and there ſetting her down, kiſſing ſometimes
her Eyes, ſometimes her Mouth, and ſometimes her Neck: And <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> thinking
her a Woman, did freely permit it; and was ſo extreamly contented to be thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed
by one ſo much reſemblant unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> as ſhe payed back her kiſſes unto
<hi>Alexis</hi> with double intereſt. None can expreſſe the fulneſs of this diſguiſed <hi>Druides</hi>
joy, unleſſe ſome that have been raviſhed by the like accident. But it may eaſily
be imagined, that <hi>Alexis</hi> was very neer making her ſelf known who ſhe was, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſhe knew that all her happineſs would be blaſted, if ſhe were diſcovered;
and perhaps had diſcovered all, had not <hi>Phillis</hi> in the height of their carreſſes knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the door: And therefore, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> fearing it ſhould be ſome body elſe, ran
preſently to bed, and looked through the Curtaines who it was which entred. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis,</hi>
vexed at the heart to be thus interrupted, ſhe went to the door, and asking
who was there, did open it unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſo much againſt her mind, that ſhe looked
not pleaſantly all the day. When <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſaw it was her Companion <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſhe
bad her good morrow, and looked about for <hi>Alexis:</hi> and when ſhe ſaw that ſhe
was not in the Chamber, ſhe thought that ſhe was gone to walk, as formerly ſhe
had done; <hi>Phillis</hi> alſo enquired for her, and they anſwered that ſhe was not very
well, and was gone into another Chamber, but would return preſently. <hi>Phillis</hi> did
eaſily believe them, eſpecially ſeeing her clothes upon the table. But when they
were all dreſt, and ready to go out; I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> let us ſee <hi>Alexis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53527:117"/>
we go: No, no, anſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſhe deſired to be alone, but we will return
after our walk, and ſee how ſhe does: So taking <hi>Phillis</hi> by the hand, ſhe carried
her out.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the new come Shepherdeſs being walked into the Hazle Grove,
where ſhe thought to be moſt private, and might beſt entertain her own thoughts,
in contemplation of thoſe beauties which ſhe had ſeen, and of thoſe favours which
ſhe had received, or rather under a borrowed notion, had ſtoln.</p>
                     <p>But the day being now well on, and moſt Shepherds retired with their Flocks
under the ſhade, ſhe heard many <hi>Shepherds</hi> ſinging under ſhady trees, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the coming of their Shepherdeſſes: Amongſt the reſt <hi>Calidon,</hi> who was up
that morning betimes, and was come over the River of <hi>Lignon</hi> in hopes to ſee <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strea,</hi>
and to try his Fortune before he ſpoke any farther unto <hi>Phocion;</hi> And he
meeting <hi>Hylas</hi> by the way, they came together unto this place, where both of
them began of ſing: And <hi>Calidon,</hi> thinking upon <hi>Aſtreas</hi> cruel anſwer, began to
chant his complaints againſts her cruelty, in a doleful tune.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> not being accuſtomed to the voice of <hi>Calidon,</hi> although ſhe heard him
ſing, and underſtood his words, yet ſhew knew him not; but ſhe knew <hi>Hylas,</hi> and
heard him ſay: Is it poſſible <hi>Calidon,</hi> that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſhould uſe you thus? Alas <hi>Hylas!</hi>
anſwered he, it is but too true, and I wiſh I were able to uſe your receipt againſt
ſuch cruelties: The <hi>Druide</hi> heard no more of their diſcourſe, for being deſirous to
paſs unknown, ſhe left them; yet <hi>Hylas</hi> continued thus: Believe it <hi>Calidon,</hi> there
is one Shepherd, who is to be blamed for all the miſeries that befal all the Shepherds
of this Country in this kind; <hi>Sylvander</hi> is he, I mean, for he having a very ſubtile
wit, does inſinuate himſelf ſo in the good opinion of the Shepherds, as by his falſe
and ſophiſtical arguments he perſwades them, That a Lover is a man loſt in point of
reputation, if when he is ill entertained, he change his affection, as if a man were
a Rock, immoveable, and able to abide all the angry bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſts and ſtorms of a raging
Sea: ſo as a Shepherd becomes ſo much enſlaved, as in ſpite of all injuries, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſcontinue his ſervice and good will, but he muſt preſently be branded with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy;
and thus all become ſubjects unto the Tyrany of Women: whereas if
theſe maximes were not, they would not delight ſo much in ſeeing their ſervants to
languiſh, but would add every day freſh favours, in hopes to keep us from chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.
Unto all this <hi>Calidon</hi> anſwered thus; you are much miſtaken <hi>Hylas,</hi> if you
think <hi>Sylvander</hi> to be the firſt Author of theſe opinions: The Shepherds of this
Country have for many ages obſerved the ſame Laws; and though cuſtome did not
oblige us unto it, yet the beauty of our Shepherdeſſes would conſtraine us: For is
it poſſible to Love them once, and not alwayes? I ſee, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> that now
you do Love <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and therefore one muſt not argue the matter with you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rules of reaſon: But I hope to ſee you as far from this affection, as
you are from that of <hi>Celidea.</hi> Several reaſons, anſwered <hi>Calidon,</hi> did divert me
from her you laſt named, and many more do oblige me never to ceaſe loving the
other, unleſs I ceaſe to live; for beſides the accident, which took away the beauty
of <hi>Celidea,</hi> and which was the firſt cauſe of my affection, I was obliged to reſtore
her unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> in point of honour; but ſetting this and all other conſiderations
aſide, having ſubmitted my ſelf by oath unto arbitration, doubtleſſe I ſhould have
drawn upon me, both the anger of Heaven, and hatred of men, if I had not been
obedient unto it. On the other ſide, all things do induce, and invite me, never to
change my affection unto <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> for in the firſt place, her beauty is ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be equalled. She is ſo much the prouder for that, ſaid <hi>Hylas:</hi> No matter,
anſwered <hi>Calidon,</hi> a little pride in a Woman makes her the more amiable. Yes,
ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſo ſhe be proud unto others, and not unto us: but is not beauty very
ſubject unto the injury and blaſts of time? Oh <hi>Hylas!</hi> anſwered <hi>Calidon,</hi> when age
has blaſted the beauty of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> the ſame age will make <hi>Calidon</hi> not much care for
beauty: moreover, Parents who have the government of her, and thoſe who have
the power over me, do allow of this affection. The contentment of Parents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Hylas,</hi> is often a cauſe that Women will not Love thoſe who otherwiſe are
not diſpleaſing unto them; as well becauſe, they cannot abide Parents ſhould be
courted more then themſelves, as becauſe conſtraint is odious unto them: For Love
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53527:118"/>
never comes by conſtraint, nor the opinion of others; but only by the will of thoſe
who love.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is ſo wiſe (replied <hi>Calidon</hi>) that ſhe will be conformable unto the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of her friends. May be not (replied <hi>Hylas</hi>) <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is able to build upon her
own reſolution. I ſhould eaſily believe it (ſaid <hi>Calidon</hi>) did I not ſee that ſhe is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged,
and free from loving any: and as yet I have not done her ſervice ſufficient
to engage her: ſo as ſhould ſhe be eaſily won, ſhe would not be ſo eſtimable. Oh
<hi>Calidon</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) Do you think long ſervice will make her love? Alas, alas poor
Shepherd, I pity you, if you be of that opinion; you had need to make proviſion
of Spectacles to ſee her Beauty withal at that time; for when it comes, I believe you
will not be able to ſee without them. Did you never hear how <hi>Celadon</hi> loved her?
Yes (replied <hi>Calidon</hi>) but he being dead, that makes nothing againſt me: Nothing
againſt you! ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> Yes, yes perhaps more then you imagine: For why elſe,
according to <hi>Sylvanders</hi> doctrine, ſhould ſhe preſerve the memory of him ſo freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as <hi>Tyrcis</hi> does of his dead <hi>Cleon?</hi> But this is not that I would ſay: Do you
know how long this <hi>Celadon</hi> Courted her? Some four or five years (anſwered <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>)
Well friend, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> Do you not think a pair of Spectacles will do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well at five years end? I do not think (ſaid <hi>Calidon</hi>) that ſo long a time is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to win her; but though it be, yet I ſhould not be reduc'd unto any ſuch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as you ſpeak of. Shepherd, ſhepherd, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> you may flatter your ſelf
as long as you pleaſe, but you may conſider, that nothing is more certain then expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and what you have formerly ſeen come to paſs. Conſider if you be wiſe,
that it may come to paſs again: You ſay ſhe is not engaged in her affection unto
any: Why, this is it Friend which makes me think worſe of your buſineſs; for thoſe
women which will love any, may be drawn and won to love us; but theſe inſenſible
Creatures are ſuch things as do not ſo much as know what and whom is to be
loved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Calidon</hi> began to boggle at the reaſons which <hi>Hylas</hi> urged, and thought them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtrong. I aſſure you <hi>Hylas</hi> (ſaid he) I ſtand in need of all theſe conſolations
which you give me, I think my ſelf happy in meeting with you. If you would have
me flatter you (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) I could ſpeak in another dialect, but if your judgement
be ſound, you will ſee I ſpeak like a friend: If you deſire to find comfort in your
miſery, you muſt uſe the like remedies which I alwaies did in the like caſes; which if
you do, I will warrant you from taking any harm from ſuch a diſeaſe as this. But
let me tell you (anſwered <hi>Calidon</hi>) that if you mean, quitting <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> or loving
any other, I had rather loſe my eyes then look upon any other Beauty then hers;
and loſe this heart which gives me life, then ever love any other Shepherdeſs then
<hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Upon this, being a little angry with <hi>Hylas,</hi> he would have gone away
from him: But <hi>Hylas</hi> held him, and ſmiling, ſaid unto him. Nay (ſaid he) if you
be upon that lock, and deſire ſo much to ſee <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you may go into the Grove of
<hi>Hazles:</hi> For I ſaw her there alone, but would not tell you, becauſe I feared you
would but loſe all your labour: For a woman is ſomtimes like unto death, which
comes upon us before we be aware, and leaſt think upon it. <hi>Hylas</hi> (ſaid <hi>Calidon</hi>)
It was not friendly done, to keep me ſo long from my happineſs in being with her.
Nay, nay, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> take heed you come not ſoon enough to receive a courſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.
<hi>Calidon</hi> having not ſo much patience as to ſtay ſo long to reply, he
went as faſt as he could to the place which <hi>Hylas</hi> named, thinking it the moſt happy
opportunity that poſſibly could be, to find her in a place where none would interrupt
their diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hylas</hi> thought he had told him right; for ſeeing <hi>Alexis</hi> only behind in the habit
of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he was miſtaken. In the mean time the <hi>Druide</hi> being deſirous to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
her own ſweet Imaginations of that Viſion which ſhe had lately ſeen. ſhe went
a great pace unto the wood, where the ſolitude of the place, and the freſh memory
of thoſe Favours ſhe had received, did repreſent before the eyes of her fancy, the
Beauties and ſweet Kiſſes of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> in ſuch lively apprehenſions, that folding her
Arms, and lifting her eyes up to heaven: Oh good Gods, ſaid ſhe, that <hi>Alexis</hi>
could be happy without <hi>Celadon;</hi> or that <hi>Celadon</hi> could be happy without <hi>Alexis:</hi>
Were I really <hi>Alexis,</hi> and not <hi>Celadon,</hi> how happy ſhould I be in <hi>Aſtreas</hi> favours?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53527:118"/>
And oh how much more happy ſhould I be, if being <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhe did not do me
theſe Favours as being <hi>Alexis!</hi> Was ever Lover ſo happy and unhappy both, as I
am? Happy in being careſſed by the Faireſt and moſt Lovely Shepherdeſs in the
world; and unhappy, in that all theſe favours would moſt certainly be turned into
Torments, were I not ſhrouded under the vail of <hi>Alexis.</hi> Here ſtopping a little,
and afterwards beginning again; But <hi>Celadon</hi> (ſaid he) how long muſt this diſguiſe
laſt? What end doſt thou aim at in this thy deſigne? Doſt thou think thou canſt
delude always? Why (fooliſh Lover!) doſt thou not declare thy ſelf? Does ſhe
not as good as tell thee, that all her amity with <hi>Alexis</hi> proceeds only from her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
unto <hi>Celadon?</hi> This manifeſts that ſhe does not hate this Shepherd, ſince
thinking him dead, ſhe does cheriſh his memory: And doſt thou think thy preſence
would not be welcome to her, when ſhe ſees himſelf upon his knees before her living,
and adoring her? Go, go and caſt thy ſelf at her feet; ſay thus unto her, Here
Faireſt Shepherdeſs, is <hi>Celadon</hi> moſt humbly before you; he died when you were
diſpleaſed, and now is revived again, ſince you are pleaſed with him in the face of
<hi>Alexis:</hi> If he hath ſinned in any thing againſt you, he hath done penance for it:
but if you think his fault yet unexpiated, command him what torments you ſhall
pleaſe, and you ſhall find him more ready to obey, then you can be to command:
Upon this, ſtanding a while ſilent, he conſidered whether this reſolution was good
or no; but afterwards beginning again, Peace, peace <hi>Celadon</hi> (ſaid he) content thy
ſelf with being dead, and envie not the happineſs of <hi>Alexis;</hi> ſince thou canſt not
thy ſelf, let her enjoy it: for all the hopes thou haſt, is by the interceſſion of this
<hi>Druide,</hi> unto whoſe conduct thou ought wholly to ſubmit thy ſelf: And do not
flatter thy ſelf ſo much, as to think that ſhe loves thy reſemblance in her; Perhaps
indeed thy face may be like hers; but it is thy fault which invites her to hate thee:
If there be any thing in thee which can pleaſe her, it is that in thy ſoul thou didſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
infringe the Laws of a perfect affection; and wilt thou ſtain the innocency of thy
Love by ſo great a diſobedience as this? I do command you (ſaid ſhe unto thee) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to ſee my face until I do allow it. Love her then, oh <hi>Celadon!</hi> Obey her, and
be ſilent, if thou wilt live and love without reproach. Thus did this <hi>Druide</hi> think
her ſelf in a place where ſhe might enjoy her own thoughts with delight; and Love,
who perhaps was jealous of the Favours which Fortune had done her, did venome
them with theſe mortal imaginations; ſo as her eyes being over-flowed with Tears,
ſhe was conſtrained to the uſe of her Handkerchief: And becauſe <hi>Calidon</hi> at the
ſame time came into the Wood, ſhe no ſooner ſpied him, but ſhe ſtarted back, as if
ſhe were ready to tread upon a Serpent; and went away (ſhunning him) into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Walk, which was in the high Wood, out of the Grove: But as Fortune was,
<hi>Hylas</hi> was walking there; and ſeeing her, did ſuſpect the reaſon of her coming into
that Wood; for he ſaw her run, and obſerved the place into which ſhe entred; and
ſtayed a while to inform <hi>Calidon,</hi> whom he believed was not far off; and yet he was
deceived, for <hi>Calidon</hi> not thinking her to be gone out of the Wood, he ſought her
in every place there, as if he had looked for a pin: But finding all his labour loſt, he
then believed that ſhe had purpoſely hid her ſelf from him; and thinking this indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity
too great to be endured, he was ſo vexed to ſee himſelf thus ſlighted, as firſt
in anger, and afterwards in deſpair, he reſolved an hundred times never to love
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> any longer: But then, aſſoon as he thought upon her Beauty and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
he changed that thought, and was more entangled in this affection then ever.
In the mean time, <hi>Hylas,</hi> who ſtayed to ſhew him which way <hi>Aſtrea</hi> paſſed, began
to be weary of this ſtay, when he ſaw coming from towards the Houſe, <hi>Leonide,
Diana, Phillis,</hi> and amongſt them (as he thought) <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> At the firſt, he durſt
have ſworn the contrary; for he thought that he had ſeen her on the other ſide; but
going neerer, he could not give his eyes the lie, which aſſured him that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was
in the company; when one came behind him, and laid their hands upon his eyes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to make him gueſs who it was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hylas</hi> ſtood ſtill; feeling her hands, and finding them to be the hands of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
I know (ſaid he) who you are; but my wonder is, how you got behind me:
whilſt he was talking thus, all the company came up, and could hear <hi>Hylas</hi> continue
his talk: I do know (ſaid he) that you are <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> Then letting him go, he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53527:119"/>
miſtaken, and that it was <hi>Laonice.</hi> What <hi>Hylas</hi> (ſaid ſhe) do you know your
friends no better then ſo? No wonder Shepherdeſs, ſaid he, that I ſhould thus
miſtake you for <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for I ſaw her juſt now enter into that Wood; and as ſoon
as you laid your hands upon my eyes, I ſaw her juſt before me amongſt this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
What ſhould I think, when ſeeing her in ſeveral places at once, but that ſhe
can be every where? How <hi>Hylas!</hi> ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> Did you ſee me enter into that
Wood? I did ſee you, anſwered he, and I am not alone that ſaw you; for <hi>Calidon</hi>
is ſtill amongſt the <hi>Hazles</hi> looking for you. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and the reſt of the company
did know well enough his miſtake; but ſeeing otherwiſe, Certainly (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>)
your eyes are not very good this morning; for this Nymph and we all are able to
witneſs that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> has been all this day with us. I ſee <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is there (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>)
and I know that the <hi>Aſtrea</hi> which I ſaw yonder, could not poſſibly be ſo ſoon with
you, for ſhe went the quite contrary way: But I am certain that I did ſee one
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> there, elſe Ile never truſt my eyes again. <hi>Leonide</hi> and all the company laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſee him in ſuch a maze: And becauſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was very deſirous to ſee this <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
which he ſpake of, <hi>Hylas</hi> (ſaid ſhe) we will think you out of your wits if you do not
ſhew us this other <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and therefore ſhew us which way ſhe went. You may
think me as much out of my wits as you pleaſe (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) and I aſſure you, I think
as much my ſelf; for I am the moſt miſtaken man alive, if I did not ſee one <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
there, and another yonder, and therefore I beſeech you let us go and look for her.
Upon this he led the way into the high wood, and having looked long in vain, at laſt
he thought that he ſaw her ſitting by an arm of the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> under a ſhady
Tree. <hi>Hylas</hi> went on as faſt as he could hye, and when he came ſo neer as to know
her, he beckned unto the reſt of the company to come neerer; and taking <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
by one hand, and pointing at <hi>Alexis</hi> with the other: Look Shepherdeſs (ſaid he
unto her) Are not you ſitting under yonder Tree? Unto which <hi>Phillis</hi> anſwered, I
believe late ſervant (ſaid ſhe) that you are of the nature of Lions, who know their
Keepers better by their clothes then by their faces. Why do you ſay ſo, anſwered
<hi>Hylas?</hi> Becauſe (replied <hi>Phillis</hi>) thoſe clothes which you ſee are like unto thoſe
which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> wears, therefore you are perſwaded it is ſhe. They talked ſo loud,
and <hi>Hylas</hi> made ſuch a noiſe, that <hi>Alexis</hi> turned about, and ſaw all the company
coming towards her: Therefore wiping her eyes, and ſetting as jolly a look upon it
as ſhe could, ſhe roſe up and came to meet them; And becauſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi>
beckned unto her to ſeem as if ſhe were a ſtranger, ſhe demeaned her ſelf ſo, that
both <hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Laonice</hi> did not know her: As for <hi>Phillis,</hi> they had acquainted her
already with the paſſage. <hi>Hylas</hi> went to her, and ſaid, I aſſure you, fair Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs,
you had almoſt turned my mind when I ſaw you at a diſtance; and now I ſee
you neerer, I am afraid you will quite make me alter my affection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> ſeeming not to know him, or what he ſaid, I beſeech you Shepherd, ſaid
ſhe, pardon me if I do not anſwer, for I do not underſtand what you ſay. I mean,
replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> that taking you for <hi>Aſtrea</hi> in one place, and ſeeing <hi>Astrea</hi> preſently
in another, I was almoſt out of my wits; but now I do ſee you perfectly, I fear you
will ſteal away my heart, which I gave unto another. You do very much oblige
me (anſwered <hi>Alexis</hi>) to take me for ſo fair a Shepherdeſs, whom I have ſo much
deſired the happineſs of ſeeing and knowing; but then you do as much diſ-oblige
me, in ſuſpecting me for a Thief; for you muſt know, I never uſe to take anything
but what is my own: But if you will repair the injury you have done me, ſhew me
which of all theſe fair ones is <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and I will pardon the offence. I believe, ſaid
<hi>Hylas,</hi> that did you know me, you would not think, that in letting you take my
heart from another, I have committed any offence, for <hi>Hylas</hi> never gives it unto
any: yet ſince it is an eaſie matter to repair the injury which you pretend I have
done you, I will not diſpute it any further; upon condition, that when i have ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your curioſity in ſhewing you <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you will not diſdain to accept the gift of this
heart of <hi>Hylas,</hi> and ſo free your ſelf from the guilt of theft. Firſt (anſwered the
new Shepherdeſs) ſhew me which is <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and we will talk afterwards of the
heart of <hi>Hylas,</hi> as it ſeems you call your ſelf. This is ſhe (anſwered <hi>Hylas</hi>) and
ſhewed her <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who could not chuſe but laugh as well as all the company, to ſee
<hi>Hylas</hi> ſo blind as not to know <hi>Alexis;</hi> who going unto <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſaluted her, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53527:119"/>
held ſome diſcourſe of civility, purpoſely to deceive <hi>Hylas</hi> the more, who was ſo
much taken with the behaviour of this ſtranger, that he could not chuſe but preſs
her to the reception of his heart: How now my late ſervant? ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> what will
<hi>Stella</hi> ſay when ſhe hears you offer your ſelf unto this Fair ſtranger? What ſhould
ſhe ſay, anſwered he, but that I have obſerved our articles, by which it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me, to Love whom, when, and where I lifted, without any offence to her?
How Shepherd (ſaid the new Shepherdeſs) can you think I will allow of any ſharer
in Love? Why not? anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> as long as I love you as much as you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire?
But I beſeech you, ſaid ſhe, would you in earneſt Love me, and Love another
beſides? Yes ſaid <hi>Hylas:</hi> and if after dinner there remain any meat, would you have
have me throw it to the dogs? And ſo after I have Loved you as much as you can
deſire, and have ſome Love yet to ſpare, why ſhould I not imploy it in loving thoſe
who ſtand in need of it? Oh Shepherd, ſaid the ſtranger, believe it, I will not allow
of any ſharers with me; he that Loves me, muſt Love only me, and therefore you
are not like to have me for your Miſtris: Nor you me (anſwered <hi>Hylas</hi>) for your
ſervant; and ſince you are of ſuch an humour, I adviſe you to look out for one <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi>
who is ſuch a one as will fit your turn. Now <hi>Sylvander</hi> is mentioned, ſaid
<hi>Phillis,</hi> where is he? for I wonder we do not ſee him this morning? It is well for
you <hi>Hylas</hi> that he is not here, for he would have checked you for thus talking of
Love unto this Paire ſtranger, at the firſt ſight. <hi>Hylas</hi> would have anſwered, but
<hi>Laonice</hi> interrupted him; Nay, nay, <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid ſhe, you may talk of Love, or
what you will to day, for I am ſure you will not ſee him; and though he were here,
I could not contradict you, for he is imployed in the like ſervice, and offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
unto it. What ſervice is that? (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> preſently) You muſt know, anſwered
the ſpiteful <hi>Laonice,</hi> that <hi>Paris</hi> chanced to meet with a ſtrange Cavalier, who thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out many menaces againſt <hi>Therſander;</hi> and <hi>Sylvander,</hi> undertaking to acquaint
<hi>Madonthe</hi> with it from him, he did this morning tell her of it; and ſhe fearing leſt
<hi>Therſander</hi> ſhould receive ſome hurt by reaſon of her, ſhe reſolved to return pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
into <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and deſired me to make her excuſes unto you all, giving a
thouſand thanks for the favours ſhe has received, and promiſing never to forget
them. But poor <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſeeing her ready to depart, and not able any longer to
hide the ſecret affection which he bare unto her, in the firſt place he uſed al the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that poſſibly he could to divert her journey, and then ſeeing he could not
prevail, he offered himſelf to wait upon her: but ſhe, being unwilling to accept of
his offer, leſt (as I believe) ſhe ſhould make <hi>Therſander</hi> jealous, ſhe refuſed him
an hundred times: He ſeeing he could not obtain that favour from her, he fell
down upon his knees, kiſſed her feet, and conjured with the moſt earneſt ſolicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that ever I heard, to give him leave; and ſhe not knowing how in civility to put
him off after ſuch importunity, ſhe permitted him to go with her a days journey or
two.</p>
                     <p>I believe (ſaid <hi>Astrea</hi>) that you are miſtaken, if you think <hi>Sylvander</hi> in Love
with any: In Love with any, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> pray what do you think of his behaviour
towards <hi>Diana?</hi> Oh! anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> that is only a Fiction. Yes <hi>Hylas,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Laonice,</hi> his behaviour towards that Shepherdeſs is but a fiction; he himſelf
ſwore it this morning a hundred times, when <hi>Madonthe</hi> charged him with it. Well,
well <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Madonthe</hi> to him, though my abſence do a little trouble you,
yet the preſence of <hi>Diana</hi> will comfort you. <hi>Diana,</hi> anſwered he, does merit more
then my ſervice, neither ſhould I ever have rendered her any, but in reſpect of
my wager with <hi>Phillis;</hi> and I wiſh ſhe were here, that you might ſee the truth of
my words. <hi>Phillis</hi> who knew that this diſcourſe would much diſpleaſe her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
did anſwer thus; I cannot poſſibly believe that <hi>Sylvander</hi> does Love <hi>Madonthe,</hi>
for he never made the leaſt ſhew of it. I believe (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> and interrupted her)
that you are much miſtaken; for I have ſeen ſufficient ſigns of it: and why ſhould
not a young Shepherd that has Wit and Spirit enough, Love a Woman that is ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
as <hi>Madonthe?</hi> Eſpecially ſince <hi>Laonice</hi> ſpeaks it knowingly, and ſaw him
obtain this permiſſion to wait upon her with ſo much importunity? But good <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> is it certain that <hi>Sylvander</hi> has followed <hi>Madonthe?</hi> Do you think
(ſaid the ſubtile Shepherdeſſe) that I would ſay it unleſs I ſaw them depart? Why
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53527:120"/>
ſhould I verifie a thing which if it were not true, would ſo eaſily be proved to be a
lye? Farewel <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and come back again even when you have a
mind. Upon this, ſeeming as if ſhe were not troubled at it, ſhe turned away, and
went from them; but <hi>Phillis</hi> followed her, and heard her upbraid <hi>Sylvander</hi> with
inconſtancy: Ah Shepherd, ſaid ſhe, are theſe the effects of that Love which you
ſhewed unto me? Is this the eternity of thy affection? And didſt thou trouble
both thy ſelf and me with thy diſguiſe, to quit me for <hi>Madonthe?</hi> Haſt thou ſo often
and ſo long blamed the Inconſtancy of <hi>Hylas,</hi> to become as ill thy ſelf? Then <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
ſeeing <hi>Phillis</hi> follow her! Well Siſter, ſaid ſhe, what do you now think of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander?</hi>
I muſt needs confeſs, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> that if <hi>Laonice</hi> ſay truly, I was
never in my life ſo miſtaken as in this Shepherd; for I have ſeen him make ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of a real paſſion, as I thought it impoſſible to be ever extinguiſhed.
But is there any credit to be given to <hi>Laonice?</hi> Yes doubtleſs (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what ſhe hath told us, I have alwaies obſerved a great affection in him towards
<hi>Madonthe;</hi> and when <hi>Paris</hi> ſent him word of the menaces which were threatned
unto <hi>Therſander,</hi> how ready he was to be the Meſſenger? It muſt be confeſſed that
<hi>Madonthe</hi> is very fair and diſcreet, yet truly in my eye ſhe is not very amiable; and
were I a man, I ſhould ſerve many others that are not ſo fair, rather then her: and
all this while ſhe has been amongſt us, have we ſeen any that loved her except <hi>Hylas</hi>
and <hi>Sylvander?</hi> For my part, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I have the ſame opinion of <hi>Madonthe</hi>
which you have, but I cannot believe that <hi>Sylvander</hi> loves her; and as for your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of him, truly I think them only effects of his curteſie and civility towards
that ſtranger. But, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> what do you think of his ſo earneſt ſolicitation
to wait upon her? Think, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> That it was ſtill his curteſie. It had
been curteſie ſufficient, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> to have undertaken the office of <hi>Laonice,</hi>
and brought us her excuſes; but to fall upon his knees, to ſhed tears, and to go
with her almoſt by force, and leave us without bidding one adieu, if this be curteſie,
and not Love, I know not what is Love. But its no matter, I am ſure he has much
obliged me in this action; for I muſt confeſs, his continual courtſhip, and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
behaviour had begun in me ſuch a good opinion of him, as I began to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineable
to wiſh him very well, and indeed to love him. What a lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
had I been in, if he had ſtayed a little longer: And ſince he is of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
I had rather both he and I were dead, then he ſhould have known my mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phillis</hi> perceiving that <hi>Diana</hi> did love this Shepherd, and foreſeeing that ſhe could
never decline it without moſt mortal diſpleaſure; Siſter (ſaid ſhe unto her) let us not
give ſuch eaſie credit unto <hi>Laonice;</hi> ſtay till <hi>Sylvander</hi> return; and condemn not a
man before you hear him anſwer for himſelf. Nay, nay Siſter, replied <hi>Diana</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
the ſtone is already thrown; let him ſay and do what he will, I know what
to think. But ſiſter, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> It is unjuſt to condemn before you hear. No, no
ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> all that hear him, will judge him in the wrong: and if you love me, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not to divert me from the mind I am in. But becauſe I remember he has a
Bracelet of my hair, which once I made for you, I beſeech you ask it of him from
me, the next time you ſee him. I know that Shepherds of his humour uſe to brag of
ſuch favours as they can get from unadviſed Shepherdeſſes; and if I could, I would
not have him do ſo by me. <hi>Phillis</hi> ſeeing <hi>Diana</hi> much vexed, and thinking it not a
time to contrary her, ſhe was ſilent a while; and when they offered to continue
their diſcourſe, they ſaw all the company coming towards them, but much encreaſed,
becauſe <hi>Adamas, Daphnide, Alcidon, Paris, Hermantes, Stiliana,</hi> and <hi>Carlis</hi>
were there: Amongſt them alſo was <hi>Lerindas,</hi> the meſſenger from <hi>Galathea</hi> unto
the great <hi>Druide,</hi> who would not return before he had ſeen <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> of
whoſe Beauty he thought he could not ſpeak too high. But <hi>Adamas</hi> was much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
ſince he underſtood by <hi>Lerindas</hi> the mind of <hi>Galathea;</hi> for he was unwilling
to diſpleaſe her, and he ſaw there was no going to her without <hi>Alexis,</hi> and he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that ſhe who had ſeen <hi>Celadon</hi> in the habit of <hi>Lucinda,</hi> would find him under the
diſguiſe of <hi>Alexis.</hi> Therefore not knowing whom to adviſe withal but <hi>Leonide</hi> and
this diſguiſed <hi>Druide,</hi> he acquainted that Nymph with his perplexity. <hi>Leonide</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an excellent wit, preſently returned this anſwer. Sir, ſaid ſhe, you muſt leave
<hi>Alexis</hi> and me here; for be aſſured, if <hi>Galathea</hi> ſees her, ſhe knows her; and if
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53527:120"/>
ſhe ſhould know her, it would be a great blemiſh to your profeſſion: The Gods do
ſeem to direct you unto this courſe; for you ſee <hi>Alexis</hi> ſo diſguiſed in the habit of a
Shepherdeſs, that <hi>Hylas</hi> does not know her; and which is of moſt concernment, I
am confident <hi>Lerindas</hi> will not; ſo as it is an eaſie matter to perſwade all the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that <hi>Alexis</hi> is not well, and keeping her bed, you left me to keep her company,
for I have no mind to ſee the Nymph as long as ſhe continues in the humour wherein
I left her; But if you reſolve upon this courſe, which as I conceive is the only way
to keep <hi>Alexis</hi> out of ſight: Two things muſt be done, firſt, This new Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs
muſt handſomly ſteal out of the company, and get into her chamber, leſt <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindas</hi>
or <hi>Alcidon,</hi> or any elſe, ſhould come at laſt to know her. The other is, That
I do uſe ſome artifice or other to get thoſe Shepherdeſſes who know of her diſguiſe
to entreat you, Father, that we may ſtay here a while under colour of <hi>Alexis</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
her complexion which ſhe loſt in her ſickneſs; for otherwiſe they may ſuſpect
ſomthing, and it is not yet time for our plot to be diſcovered. <hi>Adamas</hi> who had
not yet taken notice how <hi>Alexis</hi> was diſguiſed, did wonder he ſhould not know her,
and upon ſerious cogitation, did approve of <hi>Leonides</hi> opinion: But <hi>Alexis</hi> much
more when ſhe knew it; as well becauſe ſhe thought <hi>Galathea</hi> would know her, as
becauſe ſhe was afraid that then ſhe ſhould loſe thoſe ſweet contentments which ſhe
enjoyed with her Shepherdeſs, whoſe kiſſes and careſſes could not chuſe but be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
unto her, though ſhe received them only under the notion of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi>
only the Bearer of the name. All three therefore concurring in opinion, the
thing was preſently reſolved upon; and the new Shepherdeſs ſtole away from the
company, and looked her ſelf in her chamber; where undreſſing her ſelf, ſhe went
to bed, after ſhe had dreſſed her ſelf as if ſhe were ſick, On the other ſide, <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
having bid good morrow unto <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> I am very ſorry, ſaid he unto
them all, that I muſt leave you ſooner then I reſolved; for fair Shepherdeſſes, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea</hi>
has ſent for me, and I muſt go immediately unto her; <hi>Lerindas</hi> here ſwears
he will not leave me till I go. <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who was moſt ſorry for the news, Oh Sir,
ſaid ſhe, is there a neceſſity of your going ſo ſoon? Can you not prolong it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle?
<hi>Lerindas</hi> began then to ſpeak; He cannot go ſo ſoon (ſaid he) nor be with the
Nymph ſo ſuddenly as ſhe deſires. It is not to you <hi>Lerindas,</hi> that I ſpeak (ſaid
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> with an angry look) for I know meſſengers are always in haſte. <hi>Adamas</hi>
knowing very well why ſhe ſaid ſo; Sweetheart, ſaid he, I cannot now ſtay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Nymph ſends me word ſhe has buſineſs with me, and <hi>Lerindas</hi> tells me
there is a ſtranger with her, of whom ſhe makes great account: perhaps the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is of ſome great concernment, and delay may do much hurt. The Shepherdeſs
ſhrugged her ſhoulders, and with a ſad look retired to <hi>Leonide,</hi> who beckned to her
with her ſinger. In the mean time <hi>Adamas</hi> deſired all the company to go home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and after Dinner, to go with him. Of all the company, none was ſo much
amazed as <hi>Hylas;</hi> for every man looking for one to wait upon particularly, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
were devoted unto the new Shepherdeſs; and after he had looked all over for
her, and all in vain; Fair Nymph ſaid he unto <hi>Leonide,</hi> I beſeech you tell me where
and what is become of that Shepherdeſs with whom <hi>Adamas</hi> and you were talking
but almoſt juſt now? Unto whom (anſwered <hi>Leonide</hi>) did you commit the cuſtody
of her? Unto my eyes, ſaid <hi>Hylas.</hi> Then, ſaid ſhe, you muſt ask your eyes; for
we who were otherwiſe buſie, did take no notice of her. Believe me, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi>
if ſhe return not again, I laid by my ſtock of Love in vain, which I intended to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
in her ſervice. Why, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> were you ſo haſty in making your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion?
I thought you would have taken more time before you reſolved upon a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of that importance. Nay, nay, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that would be enough for <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi>
who had need to aſſemble all the Orders of <hi>Gaul,</hi> before he can reſolve
whether he ſhould Love or no. For my part, I can reſolve upon ſuch a buſineſs in
a day, as well as he can in an hundred years: For aſſoon as ever he ſees a Fair one,
he conſults with himſelf whether ſhe has all the qualities that are fit for his Taſte:
Perhaps he will finde her too tall, or too low: too black, or too Brown: her eyes
may be too gray, her noſe too long, or too little, her mouth too big, or too little,
perhaps her chin too ſharp, her cheeks too lean; and if ſhe be defective in any of
theſe, he has done: But aſſoon as ever my eye meets with a Fair one, and ſhe ſeem
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53527:121"/>
fair unto them, I never ſtay to examine any particulars, but preſently my will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
to Love her, and makes proviſion immediatly to beſiege the Fort, or lay by
ſuch a ſum of love, as I think will buy it. Me thinks <hi>Hylas,</hi> replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſince
you have taken ſo much paines about this ſtranger, you ſhould take a little more,
and go to ſeek her, whilſt this Shepherdeſs and I, do talk about ſome buſineſs,
which much concerns us.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, both of them turning another way, they ſeperated themſelves from
the reſt of the Company, to the end none might hear them: then <hi>Leonide</hi> ſpoke
thus unto the Shepherdeſſe: You heard, Sweetheart, how <hi>Adamas</hi> ſaid he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to go away, and he was of neceſſity ſo to do; for otherwiſe the Nymph
would have occaſion to be angry with him. But let me tell you, that I was never
in my life in a place from whence I am ſo unwilling to depart as this: and not only
I, but <hi>Alexis</hi> alſo, who I could never have believed would have liked it ſo well, if
I did not ſee it; for having been brought up in great aſſemblies, and continually
converſant in the buſineſſe of the world, it is hardly imaginable, that a life ſo reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and ſolitary, ſhould ſure with her diſpoſition: And yet I have obſerved, that
ſince ſhe came hither, her complexion is much bettered, which I believe proceeds
from the affectionate Love ſhe has taken unto you, which is ſo great, that yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
ſhe ſwore unto me, that a ſeparation from you would wound her very heart and
ſoul. Madam, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> It is an unexpreſſible happineſs unto me that our
kind of life, and our paſtimes, are pleaſing unto you, and the Fair <hi>Alexis,</hi> for my
part, I am moſt entirely devoted unto both your ſervices, and think your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
my greateſt honour and happineſſe: ſuch is my affection unto <hi>Alexis,</hi> as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Madam, that nothing upon earth can or ſhall ſeparate me from her, ſo ſhe will
but be pleaſed to accept of me: And therefore I do moſt humbly and heartily beſeech
you, to aſſiſt me with your favour in my addreſſes unto her and <hi>Adamas,</hi> for I am
fully reſolved to follow her unto <hi>Dreux,</hi> and <hi>Carnutes,</hi> when ſhe returns. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
difficulty concerning that, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> reſts not in them: for I could find a
way to procure both their conſents; but it reſts in your own Parents: Oh Madam!
ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> let that be the leaſt of your care, for I know wel enough what to do in that,
you know it hath pleaſed God to leave me without either Father, Mother, or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
As for <hi>Procion</hi> my Uncle, I ow him no ſuch obedience, but I may very well
diſpoſe of my ſelf amongſt the <hi>Druides</hi> Daughters without any reproach: No, no,
Madam, there is nothing ſo juſt as to devote our ſelves unto him who gives us all
we have. Were it a matter of marriage, or diſpoſition of my eſtate, it were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſe; but in reſigning my ſelf up into the hands of the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> I cannot
be blamed: and therefore, Great Nymph, my only buſineſs is, by your mediation
to procure me the approbation and conſent of <hi>Adamas</hi> and the Fair <hi>Alexis.</hi> I will
do you all the good offices I can, anſwered <hi>Leonide;</hi> and let me tell you, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas</hi>
does extreamly Love <hi>Alexis,</hi> and ſo, that there needs no more but to get
her favour and conſent: But why ſhould I ſay, get her favour? Doubtleſſe you
have it already; you need no more but keep her company, and ſhe will be the firſt
that will be againſt the ſeparation. I believe her Love to you, ſurpaſſeth yours to
her; but my advice is to keep continually in her Company, and entreat <hi>Adamas</hi> to
let her and me ſtay here for a few days, which we may eaſily do under a pretence of
her being ſick: And I, ſeeing what delight ſhe took in this ſweet place, I did adviſe
her to retire into her Chamber, and pretend ſickneſſe, purpoſely for an excuſe of
ſtaying here: And though <hi>Adamas</hi> knows that ſhe is not ſick, yet he is willing to
let it paſſe ſo, becauſe it will excuſe his carrying her unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> who has long
deſired to ſee her, and keep her with her: But <hi>Adamas</hi> has no mind unto it, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſhe ſhould continue her courſe of life which ſhe has begun, ſince <hi>Tautates</hi> ſeems
to approve of it, by all the ſacrifices which he has offered, for that purpoſe. You
ſee, Fair Shepherdeſſe, how freely I ſpeak of things; and I do it, becauſe I do much
eſteem you, and would give you all the contentment that poſſibly I could. It is a
thing impoſſible to repeat the thanks which this Shepherdeſs rendred unto <hi>Leonide,</hi>
and as they were thus talking, they wandred a little out of the right way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Company had got a great way before them, they took into a path, which
might have brought them that were behind, to be before, had they not heard a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53527:121"/>
voice, which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> knew to be <hi>Calidons:</hi> and becauſe ſhe turned out of the way
to avoid hearing any more, thinking that to hearken to him were to offend againſt
the memory of <hi>Celadon, Leonide</hi> obſerved her, and knowing him to be the ſame
Shepherd that <hi>Phocion</hi> deſired to marry her unto; let us hearken a little, (ſaid ſhe)
for I am confident he is ſinging ſomething that concerns you, and you may paſſe
away through the wood unſeen, when you pleaſe: Madam, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you will
but ſpend the time in vain, for I am ſure ſuch a ſubject is not worth it. <hi>Leonide</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
not, but began to hearken, as he began to ſing out his reſolution not to Love
her longer. I knew (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) that you would loſe your labour and time in
hearing him. Me thinks, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> that he is extreamly angry; may he be ſo
eternally, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Upon this, both turning upon the left hand, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
on their way.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Paris,</hi> remembring the Counſel which <hi>Leonide</hi> gave him, to
ask <hi>Dianas</hi> leave, for asking her Parents conſent that he might marry her; and
knowing that <hi>Adamas</hi> was to go unto <hi>Galathea</hi> as ſoon as he had dined, he reſolved
to lay hold upon the opportunity which preſented it ſelf: For, as Fortune was, <hi>Diana</hi>
chanced to be all alone. And though <hi>Paris</hi> ſaw much ſadneſs in her countenance,
yet after ſome ejaculations unto <hi>Tautates</hi> to proſper his enterpriſe, he accoſted her,
and taking her under the arm, he ſaid thus unto her: You ſee, Faireſt Shepherdeſſe,
that my Father is to depart as ſoon as dinner is done, and that I am conſtrained to
go with him; ſome comforts I beſeech you give me, to preſerve the life of the moſt
faithful ſervant that ever you had. <hi>Paris,</hi> anſwered ſhe, in the quality you mention,
I cannot give you any, but in the quality of a perſon whom I do much honour, I
will give you all I am able. In the quality you mention (anſwered <hi>Paris</hi>) I ſhould
find nothing but death; and if you will not receive me as really I am, I beſeech you
command me to dye: for I am not able to live and endure the torments which I do.
Now, ſee how far ſpite and revenge may carry the heart of a woman, be ſhe never
ſo wiſe. <hi>Diana</hi> to be revenged upon <hi>Sylvander,</hi> will alſo be revenged upon her
ſelf: I do eſteem you ſo much (ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Paris</hi>) and do think the preſervation
of your life ſo dear, that there are very few things which I would not do, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it. Tell me therefore what kind of contentments do you deſire I ſhould give
you? That you would be pleaſed (replied <hi>Paris,</hi> and kiſſed her hand) to give me
ſo far permiſſion as to ask the conſent of your Parents, that I may take you as my
Wife, and one whom I will Honour, and Love as long as I have life. <hi>Bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Diana</hi> ſpoke theſe words as briefly, and as faſt as ſhe could; imitating thoſe who
take a medicine, and make all the haſt they can to get it down: For ſhe never utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
any words more againſt her heart, and ſpoke them only to vex <hi>Sylvander;</hi> for
had not paſſion poſſeſſed her underſtanding, ſhe would never have conſented unto
it. For if <hi>Sylvander</hi> did not Love her, ſhe did not at all vex him by giving her ſelf
unto another: and if he did Love her, why ſhould ſhe offer to give him any cauſe
of vexation? For ſhe did not give this permiſſion unto <hi>Paris,</hi> but only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
upon <hi>Sylvander;</hi> and would make her ſelf for ever miſerable, rather then
not prejudice him: and in this, <hi>Paris</hi> found that there is a critical hour in which
Women can deny nothing; and happy is he that can hit upon it, either by Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or by Fortune. The thanks he gave unto the Shepherdeſs, were very great,
but to no purpoſe, for ſhe was ſo much out of her ſelf, that ſhe underſtood not a
word; but as ſoon as ſhe came unto the houſe, ſhe ſtole away, and retired all alone
to her Cabin, where giving her eyes leave to weep, ſhe ceaſed not all the reſt of
the day, teaching us at her own expenſes, that ſometimes we Love more then we
do think we do, and never come to know it, but by ſome imaginary ſcorn from the
perſon loved, or when ſome conſtraint deprives us of ſight and preſence.</p>

would accompany him, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Leonide</hi> finding her in bed, they ſhut the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
and made the room ſo dark, that her face could not be ſeen. <hi>Alexis</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53527:122"/>
to be exceedingly troubled in her head; and when <hi>Adamas</hi> told her how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<hi>Galathea</hi> had ſent for him, ſhe offered to riſe, and ſaid, ſhe hoped her diſeaſe
was not ſo great, but that ſhe might follow him. But <hi>Astrea</hi> beſeeched <hi>Adamas</hi>
not to ſuffer her to walk in the heat of the Sun, which doubtleſs would make her
worſe; ſhe told him, that all the Town would be extreamly ſorry his daughter
ſhould go from amongſt them in ſuch a condition, and that every one would be as
officious and ready to ſerve her with all things that ſhould be requiſite, as he himſelf
could be; and therefore, as a witneſs of all this, ſhe beſeeched him to let <hi>Leonide</hi>
keep her company: <hi>Phocion</hi> and all the reſt joyned with her in this deſire, and uſed
ſo many Arguments, that <hi>Adamas</hi> was eaſily perſwaded to leave this diſguiſed <hi>Druide</hi>
amongſt them, yet ſeemed very ſorry for her, and ſaid he was afraid ſhe would be
too troubleſome unto them: But <hi>Phocion</hi> anſwered all thoſe objections with words
ſo full of civility and affection, that <hi>Adamas</hi> told him, he would leave her and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
amongſt them, commanding them both to come away as ſoon as <hi>Alexis</hi> was
well again: Afterwards going unto the Bed, and taking <hi>Leonide</hi> by the hand, he
told them in a low voice, that as ſoon as <hi>Galathea</hi> was paſt, he would either ſend
unto them by <hi>Paris,</hi> or come himſelf; Then hearing that meat was upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he left the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>etended ſick perſon; and as ſoon as Dinner was ended, thanking
<hi>Phocion</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he went away with <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and the reſt of the
company. But <hi>Paris,</hi> who did not ſee <hi>Diana</hi> amongſt the company, did ask <hi>Phillis</hi>
and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> where ſhe was? Who anſwered, that perhaps ſhe had ſome buſineſs
at her houſe: Which <hi>Adamas</hi> and the ſtrangers hearing, they deſired <hi>Phillis</hi> and
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> to preſent their ſorrows unto her, that they had not taken their leaves of her,
and that if poſſibly they could, they would ſee her again before they went out of the
Country.</p>
                     <p>All being thus parted, and thoſe who accompanied <hi>Adamas</hi> returned, <hi>Paris</hi> would
no longer delay his buſineſs; but addreſſing himſelf unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> he beſeeched
him he would be pleaſed to let him communicate a thing unto him by the way, which
concerned himſelf and <hi>Diana. Adamas</hi> imagining his buſineſs, told him, with all
his heart: But <hi>Paris</hi> having obtained this leave, and not knowing how to begin, he
ſtood a long while, and ſpake not a word: yet <hi>Adamas</hi> knew well enough that love
was the cauſe of his ſilence. Well <hi>Paris</hi> ſaid he, and ſmiled, Is this all you have to
ſay? <hi>Paris</hi> opened his mouth two or three times, but bluſhed and trembled ſo, as
he could not utter a word. Well well ſaid <hi>Adamas</hi> unto him, I underſtand you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, and to put you out of your pain. I know that you are in love with <hi>Diana;</hi>
but does <hi>Diana</hi> love <hi>Paris?</hi> Or rather, Does not <hi>Sylvander</hi> poſſeſs that place which
<hi>Paris</hi> deſires to have? This infuſed ſo much confidence into <hi>Paris,</hi> that he anſwered
<hi>Adamas,</hi> That he was afraid he had done amiſs in ſuffering his affection unto that
Shepherdeſs to go too far, before he made him acquainted with it: That having
uſed the habit of a Shepherd, and ſeeing her ſo oft, his love was grown to that
height, as he was not able to live unleſs he had ſuch contentment as thoſe who real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love do deſire; and therefore conſidering that thoſe Shepherds and Shepherdeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
were extracted out of as ancient and honourable Families as any was in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he thought it would be no diſparagement unto his Houſe, if he married <hi>Diana;</hi>
and that Love did at laſt force him to acquaint her with his paſſion. And what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
did you receive from her, ſaid <hi>Adamas?</hi> That <hi>Belinde</hi> (anſwered <hi>Paris</hi>) was
her mother, and had the ſole diſpoſition of her. Then ſaid <hi>Adamas</hi> unto him, I
have long obſerved that you have loved that Shepherdeſs; and had I diſliked that
alliance, I ſhould have forbidden the Banes before now: I do commend your choice,
for <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Astrea</hi> are extracted out of the beſt Families not only of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
but all <hi>Gaul: Amaſis</hi> her ſelf when ſhe knows of it, will acknowledge as much:
Alſo the Vertue and Modeſty of this Shepherdeſs is ſuch, as I ſhall think him very
happy that marries her: I mention not her Beauty, becauſe that is one of the leaſt
conſiderable qualities in a Wife; though ſhe may brag that ſhe is one of the faireſt
about all <hi>Lignon,</hi> and this <hi>Lignon</hi> includes all <hi>Europe.</hi> And therefore, I do not
only give you all the leave you can deſire, but do counſel and adviſe you not to loſe
a minute of time: And becauſe I am now going to <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> where <hi>Galathea</hi> may
perhaps ſtay me a day or two, I adviſe you to go home, and make all ready for your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53527:122"/>
journey, and when you come to <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> I will have a letter ready for you to carry
unto <hi>Belinde,</hi> that ſhe may know who you are, and treat you, according to your
own deſires. Upon this, <hi>Paris</hi> kiſſed the hand of <hi>Adamas,</hi> gave him a thouſand
thanks for this favour, and taking leave of him, of <hi>Daphnide,</hi> of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and of
all the reſt of the Company, he took upon the left hand, and went unto the houſe of
<hi>Adamas,</hi> full of contentment, and joy.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as dinner was done, the Nymph <hi>Galathea</hi> and <hi>Damon</hi> departed from
<hi>Bonlieu,</hi> to go unto <hi>Amaſis,</hi> who being very impatient, or rather troubled at the
news which ſhe received, had ſent another Cavalier to haſte them away. This was
a cauſe why <hi>Adamas</hi> ſetting out later then the Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, he
did not find her at the Temple of the good Goddeſſe as ſhe extreamly deſired; but
he, being very diligent to obſerve her as his Lady and Miſtreſs, and knowing ſhe
was gone, he entreated <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> to continue on their journey, and
he would ſend <hi>Lerindas</hi> to acquaint the Nymph, who he was confident would ſtay
for them and take them in her Coach. Theſe ſtrangers were willing to ſatisfie his
deſire, and continued on the way, and <hi>Lerindas</hi> at the <hi>Druides</hi> command, ran
before.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the Nymph and <hi>Damon,</hi> went on their journey, and talked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſeveral things as well as the way would permit them: For <hi>Damon</hi> would not go
in the Coach, but armed, rid upon an excellent Horſe, which the Nymph ſent him,
thinking himſelf in a condition to defend Fair Ladies; and therefore that day, he
wore his Head-piece, and his Buckler, which at other times his ſervant was wont to
carry. Riding on in this manner, when they were paſt the Bridge of <hi>Boutereſs,</hi>
and entred into a wood, through which the high way paſſed, not far from the
houſe of <hi>Adamas, Halladine</hi> who was behind <hi>Galatheas</hi> Coach, ſaw three Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
come ruſhing out of the wood, betwixt him and <hi>Damon,</hi> and ran with their
Launces in their Reſt as faſt as their Horſes could ride, againſt his Maſter: This
Faithful ſervant, could advertiſe his Maſter no other way, then by crying out as loud
as he could; the Cavalier turning his head at his ſervants cry, ſaw the three Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
ſo neer upon him, as all he could do was to draw his Sword, and ſheild himſelf
with his Buckler. Theſe three were no ſooner out of the wood, but <hi>Galathea</hi> ſaw
other three, who galloped as faſt as they could up to <hi>Damon</hi> alſo: who having not
ſeen the firſt three, ſhe and her Nymphes in the Coach cried out, which cauſed
<hi>Damon</hi> to turn about towards them, and miſs the ſhock of two Launces, which
otherwiſe would certainly have thrown him to the ground: the third who came a
little after the other two, received the wages for all three; for <hi>Damon</hi> in a fury to
ſee himſelf thus unworthily treated, did cut off moſt of his Arm, and he fell at his
Horſes feet. <hi>Damon</hi> ſtill hearing the Nymphes to cry out louder and louder, he
turned towards them, and ſaw the other three Cavaliers; who more adviſed then
the firſt, ran all three with their Launces at his Horſe, ſo as he fell immediatly, and
gave his Rider no more time then to get his feet out of the ſtirrups. <hi>Damon</hi> then
leaping out of the Saddle, and ſeeing himſelf ſet on by no fewer then five at once he
thought his beſt courſe was to keep neer his Horſe which lay dead; and thoſe who
aſſaulted him, ſeeing their horſes to boggle at the dead one, three of them alighted,
and two kept ſtill on horſ-back, and thus all five fell upon him at once moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.
<hi>Damon</hi> who had formerly been in the like condition, reſolved to fell his
life as deerly as he could; and the firſt footman he met with, he gave him ſuch a
blow on his head, that the mans Arms being good, but he not able to bear the
weight of that blow, he fell down in a dead ſwoon, and falling with his head againſt
a ſtone, his head piece fell off: ſo as the fight being neer the Coach, <hi>Galathea</hi> and
all the Nymphs knew him to belong unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> ſo as all the Nymphs perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Galathea</hi> to ſtay no longer there for fear of ſome Treaſon againſt her: In the
mean time the Souldiers were very buſy about <hi>Damon;</hi> but the Nymph anſwered,
that it were a ſhame for her to leave ſo brave a Cavalier in the midſt of a danger,
whereof ſhe her ſelf was the cauſe. Whilſt the Nymphs were thus talking, <hi>Damon</hi>
had ſweathed his ſword up to the very hilts in the body of one of his enemies; but
another of them, ſpying his opportunity, did cloſe with <hi>Damon,</hi> and threw him to
the ground, but yet <hi>Damon</hi> was fully revenged: for there being a defect in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53527:123"/>
Souldier's Armour, <hi>Damon</hi>'s ſword ran him into the belly, ſo as he fell dead ſome
two or three paces off: Of ſix, there remained now but three that were able to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him, and all on foot; and they fell upon him ſo reſolutely, as doubtleſs they
had diſpatched him, had not a Shepherd and a Shepherdeſs come luckily to the place:
For the Shepherd ſeeing ſo many upon one, he went to <hi>Damon</hi>'s ſervant, and asked
him why he did not defend his Maſter? Alas friend (ſaid the ſervant) moſt willingly
I would if I might; but not being of the Order of Cavalry, my Maſter has charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me not to preſume unto ſo much honour as to uſe a weapon. A moſt curſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
it is (ſaid the Shepherd) that hinders thee from helping ſo brave a Maſter
in his need: Upon this the Shepherd ran to one of the dead Cavaliers, took his
Sword and Buckler, and fell couragiouſly upon one of them that was upon <hi>Damon,</hi>
giving him ſuch a blow upon his ſhoulder, that he made him turn towards him, and
upon his turning, the Shepherd ran his Sword through the Cavaliers body under his
right Arm, ſo as he fell down dead cloſe by his companions: This did extreamly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze
thoſe that were upon <hi>Damon;</hi> and one of them ſeeing the Shepherd diſarmed,
did bid his companion chaſtiſe him who had killed their fellow; which he did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
and fell upon him ſo furiouſly, that having the advantage of fighting with one
unarmed, he gave him two or three great wounds in his Body, although the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
defended himſelf very bravely, and with much courage and dexterity; but alas,
all the blows he made were againſt hard Armour, and all thoſe he received, upon his
naked body. <hi>Damon</hi> in the mean time having now no more but one to deal with, yet
he received two or three wounds in his Thigh; but however, he cloſed with his
Antagoniſt, and ran him into the Belly, ſo as he fell dead at his feet. Then running
to relieve the Shepherd who had relieved him, he fell upon the Souldier who had
newly ſo wounded the Shepherd, as he was ſtaggering and ready to fall: <hi>Damon</hi>
preſently with a dexterous blow divided his head and his ſhoulders; and the poor
Shepherd having ſeen his revenge, he fell to the ground almoſt dead. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs
ran preſently unto him, and ſitting down upon the ground, did lay the
Shepherds bleeding head in her lap, ſo full of ſorrow to ſee him in that ſad condition,
as ſhe wiſhed her ſelf in the ſame. <hi>Damon</hi> was going to help her, when <hi>Galathea</hi>
cryed out, and bade him take heed; and doubtleſs he had been in great danger, had
ſhe not cryed out; for he thinking that all the ſix Souldiers were dead, he never
imagined that he who lay in a ſwoon ſhould riſe again, and come behind him; but
turning preſently about upon her cry, he ſaw the man with his Arm up; who gave
ſuch a weighty blow upon his Buckler, as he clove it in two; had this blow been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
behind upon his head, doubtleſſe it had cloven it alſo in two, for he had put his
Helmet off. This fellow being both ſtout and deſperate, and <hi>Damon</hi> being both
wounded and weary, the fight was very dangerous unto him, for he was not ſo nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and dexterous as uſual: yet at the laſt, he ran his Sword into the very throat of
his enemy, who fell choaked in his own blood.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Adamas</hi> came to the place, and <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Hermantes</hi> ſeeing
all this, alſo thinking that perhaps there would be no more work, they ran preſently
to thoſe that lay dead, and ſeized upon their ſwords and bucklers; then they went
unto the Nymphs Coach to defend her, and preſented themſelves in ſuch a poſture,
as made it apparently appear, they could do ſomthing elſe beſides keeping of Sheep,
although they were in that habit: As for <hi>Adamas,</hi> he went to the Shepherdeſs, and
finding him whoſe head lay in her lap to be very much wounded, he helped her to
binde up his wounds, which he had finiſhed; when <hi>Galathea</hi> ſeeing the Souldier diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched,
ſhe went unto <hi>Damon,</hi> to know how he did. <hi>Damon</hi> who ſaw that the
man who had relieved him was in a bad condition, he ran preſently to help him, but
he found that <hi>Adamas</hi> had already bound up his wounds, and the Shepherdeſs lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over him ſo ſwelled with Tears, that ſhe never looked up. The Shepherd find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his end was near, did offer twice or thrice to turn his head and look upon
her, but he could not, becauſe he lay the contrary way; yet hearing what ſad ſighs
and tears ſhe ſhed for him: Be of good comfort Madam (ſaid he unto her) and fear
not, but that he who is the juſt Judge of all, will ſend you ſome in my room to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
you into your Country: the greateſt grief that I ſhall carry to my grave, is, to
leave you in this Country, and ſee none with you that will ſerve you as faithfully as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53527:123"/>
hitherto I have done: but I know that the great and good <hi>Tautates</hi> will hear my
prayers, and guide you out of the place ſo full of danger. He would have ſpoken
more but his weakneſs would not permit him. Then the Shepherdeſs began: Alas
(ſaid ſhe) will you leave me in my greateſt need? Have you not promiſed never to
forſake me, till we find the Cavalier whom we ſeek for? Madam anſwered the
Shepherd, it is the fault of Fate, not mine: for I proteſt, I would never leave you
untill I have put you into the hands of the Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> as you deſire. Alas
Madam, you cannot juſtly accuſe me of any thing, but undertaking more then I was
able to perform; In all this long voyage, I have rendered you all the honour, all
the reſt, and all the ſervices I was able, and the great <hi>Tautates</hi> be my witneſſe, I
would have continued it ſtill, if my life might continue: and could I but ſee you in
any place of ſafety, death ſhould be muſt welcom unto me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Damon</hi> as I told you, ran to held the Shepherd; but as ſoon as ever he caſt his
eye upon him, and ſaw his face, he was amazed, and ſtood looking upon him as if
he were immovable: and doubtleſſe his admiration had been more, had not the
Shepherdeſs lifted up her drooping head, ſo as he thought that he ſhould know her
face, and the tone of her voice: but the habit of a Shepherdeſs and a Shepherd, and
the wan paleneſs of both their faces, made him ſtand in doubt, whether his eyes
and his eares did deceive him. In the mean time <hi>Halladine</hi> came unto him to bind
up his wounds; but he was ſo taken up with the ſight of this Shepherdeſs and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
that without anſwering <hi>Halladine,</hi> or ſo much as ſeeing him, he ſuffered him
to take away his Buckler, and began to diſ-arm him, where he ſaw the blood run,
when <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> came to him, and when the Shepherd, caſting his eye
by chance upon the Buckler which <hi>Halladine</hi> laid upon the ground; Oh good God,
Madam (ſaid he unto her) what is this I ſee? and with much a do, holding out his
arm, he ſhewed her the Buckler with a <hi>Tiger</hi> feeding upon a mans heart: ſo as
knowing it to belong unto that Cavalier whom they were in queſt of; Oh happy
<hi>Therſander</hi> (cryed he out) now dye when thou wilt with full contentment, ſince
Heaven has been ſo favourable unto thee as to ſee <hi>Madonthe</hi> in the hands of her ſo
much deſired Protector. <hi>Damon</hi> hearing the name of <hi>Therſander,</hi> and afterwards
<hi>Madonthe;</hi> and both of them looking upon him, he had been blind if he had not
known them. Now did he plainly ſee his long lookt for <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and <hi>Therſander</hi>
alſo, whoſe life he ſo reſolved to take away. His love of <hi>Madonthe,</hi> his hatred of
<hi>Therſander,</hi> and his unexpected meeting with them, did make him tremble, as if he
had an extream fit of an ague upon him: He knew not what to do; whether he
ſhould go away, or whether he ſhould take revenge, and kill the raviſher of his
happineſs before the face of her whom he thought had uſed him ſo ill: The injury
which he conceived he had received, did invite him to it; and his affection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
ſtayed his trembling hand: But at laſt, thinking upon the Oracle which he
had received at <hi>Mount Verdune,</hi> he quenched all deſires of revenge. But ſhaking
from him all thoſe that were ſo buſie in diſ-arming him, who thought that his
trembling proceeded from his wounds, he ran preſently to the Shepherdeſs.</p>
                     <p>Oh <hi>Madonthe, Madonthe!</hi> cryed he out, has Heaven been ſo favourable to me,
as to let me once more ſee you before I dye? Upon this kneeling down upon the
ground before her, he offered to take her hand and kiſs it; but <hi>Madonthe</hi> ſurpriſed
beyond imagination, firſt, to have met with the Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> whom ſhe
ſought for, and ſecondly, ſeeing him to be <hi>Damon</hi> whom ſhe thought long ſince
dead, ſhe was ſo raviſhed with wonder, that ſeeing him upon his knees before her,
when ſhe leaſt hoped for him, ſhe could not chuſe but with open arms embrace
him: But this unexpected meeting, and ſudden joy, made her look as if death were
in her face. <hi>Damon,</hi> on his ſide, looked as pale as ſhe, ſo as if <hi>Halladine</hi> had not
run preſently to hold them up, doubtleſs they had both faln to the ground. <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>
now knowing him alſo to be <hi>Damon,</hi> and hearing him ſpeak, he lifted up his
eyes to Heaven, having not ſo much ſtrength as to ſtir his hands: Oh God! ſaid he,
How juſt, how good, and how omnipotent thou art? Juſt in rendring <hi>Damon</hi> unto
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> and <hi>Madonthe</hi> unto <hi>Damon;</hi> good in making three perſons happy at
once: Theſe two Lovers in meeting that happineſs they deſired, and <hi>Therſander</hi> in
ſeeing ſo good a concluſion of his ſervices; and omnipotent in bringing all theſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53527:124"/>
things to paſs when we leaſt hoped for them: Oh <hi>Madonthe!</hi> Oh <hi>Damon!</hi> may
you enjoy all fulneſs of contentment, and live happily together many, many years.
Upon this expreſſion he grew pale, and reſigned his laſt breath with ſuch a ſmiling
countenance, as plainly ſhewed he left this life with contentment. <hi>Galathea</hi> in the
mean time, and <hi>Adamas,</hi> who with all the reſt of the Nymphs were come to this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier,
they were all in extream amazement, to ſee all theſe three perſons look as if
they were all dead alike. But <hi>Halladine</hi> who loved his Maſter extreamly, Madam
(ſaid he) if there be any ſparke of pity in you, I beſeech you command <hi>Damon</hi> to
diſ-arm himſelf, leaſt his loſs of blood prove the loſs of his life. How friend, ſaid
<hi>Alcidon</hi> to <hi>Halladine,</hi> is this <hi>Damon</hi> the Valiant Cavalier of <hi>Aquitane?</hi> The very
ſame Sir, ſaid <hi>Halladine,</hi> who has loſt more blood in eight dayes he has been here in
this Country; then he has of many years in all other places: Oh Father! (ſaid <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon</hi>
unto <hi>Adamas</hi>) I beſeech you let us contribute all the help we can; for I can
aſſure you, there is not a braver and more accompliſhed Cavalier in all <hi>Aquitane</hi>
then this: Then kneeling down upon the ground, he began to diſ-arm him, <hi>Damon</hi>
not being ſenſible of it. As for <hi>Madonthe</hi> after ſhe had continued a while in a ſwoon,
ſhe came again to her ſelf; and ſeeing every one ſo buſie about <hi>Damon,</hi> ſhe thought
that he was dead of thoſe wounds which he received in the combate. Oh my God!
cryed ſhe out, and wrung her hands, muſt I loſe thee <hi>Damon</hi> as ſoon as ever I have
found thee? And muſt I ſee thee now, never to ſee thee again? Miſerable wretched
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> what malevolent Star is predominate over thee? Muſt thou receive a
happineſs only to be the more ſenſible of its loſs? Oh Heavens! Oh Fate! was ever
ſuch bitter torments reſerved for any that lives? Life I defie thee; and torments do
your worſt till you have brought me to my grave: upon this, her ſighs and her tears
did ſo ſtop the paſſage of her voice, that ſhe was forced to be ſilent; but her ſilence
moved ſo much compaſſion in all the Nymphs, that whilſt <hi>Alcidon, Daphnide, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes,
Adamas,</hi> and <hi>Galathea,</hi> were about <hi>Damon,</hi> they took the Shepherdeſs under
her arms, and removed her almoſt by force from the place where ſhe was, every one
giving her all the conſolation they could.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Damon</hi> was diſ-armed, his wounds bound up as well as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency
of the place would permit; and a little after he began to open his eyes:
but being ſo weak as he was not able to riſe, he turned his head two or three times
about to look for <hi>Madonthe:</hi> and <hi>Halladine</hi> knowing very well what he looked for;
Sir, ſaid he unto him, do not trouble your ſelf ſo much, <hi>Madonthe</hi> is not far from
you; aſſume to your ſelf Sir a little courage, and all will be well: <hi>Halladine</hi> (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Damon</hi>) what doeſt thou talk of courage? Doſt thou think I can want any, that
had ſo much as to love the perfections of <hi>Madonthe?</hi> But where is ſhe? And what
is it, which hinders me from a ſight of that Fair Face? is ſhe ſtill with <hi>Therſander?
Therſander</hi> Sir, anſwered <hi>Halladine,</hi> is dead, and dyed to ſave your life, by which
you may ſee the truth of the Oracle, and what great reaſon you have to rejoyce,
ſince now your troubles are all to end. <hi>Halladine,</hi> ſaid <hi>Damon,</hi> help me to riſe, that
I may ſee whether all thou ſayſt is true. <hi>Madonthe</hi> hearing all that <hi>Damon</hi> ſaid, ſhe
took heart; and being extreamly joyed to ſee him in a better condition then ſhe
imagined, ſhe roſe up, and ran as faſt as ſhe could unto him, and without any regard
unto thoſe about him, ſhe almoſt ſmothered him with embraces; but being taken off
by <hi>Halladine,</hi> who feared that her exceſſive kindneſs might make him worſe, ſhe
ſat down upon the ground by him; and looking upon him with eyes full of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Ah <hi>Damon!</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him, is Heaven ſo good unto me, as to let me
ſee thee once more? Is it poſſible that the Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> who reſcued me
from the hands of the perfidious <hi>Leriana,</hi> ſhould prove to be <hi>Damon,</hi> whom ſhe
had ſo craftily given ſo much occaſion to hate me? And is it poſſible, Cavalier, that
thy affection to me ſhould be above her malice, and that out of thy generoſity thou
ſhouldeſt ſave her life, whom by her ſubtilty thou hadſt reaſon to hate unto death?
But Cavalier, if thou art indeed that <hi>Damon</hi> of whom I ſpeak, and if all thoſe cauſes,
together with ſo long abſence from me, have not changed thy affection, why doſt
thou ſtay ſo long before thou giveſt me ſome aſſurance of it? <hi>Damon</hi> then taking her
hand; yes, yes Madam, ſaid he, I am the very ſame <hi>Damon</hi> you ſpeak of; and
ſweat that I am nothing changed, unleſs it be in loving you more then ever I did:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53527:124"/>
All the venom of <hi>Leriana,</hi> nor all the happineſs of <hi>Therſander,</hi> was not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
the leaſt ſpark of my vowed affection to you; Heaven is the witneſs of all my
thoughts, and the Sun has ſeen all my actions: and I challenge them both to upbraid
me with the leaſt ſtain of my fidelity to you. I muſt needs confeſs, replied <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donthe,</hi>
that the treaſon of <hi>Leriana</hi> was enough to make you hate me, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all that ſhe had infuſed into you concerning the happineſſe of <hi>Therſander:</hi> But
I do vow unto you by the memory of my honoured Father, and by all my deſires
and hopes of any happineſs, that all I did was only to be the more loved by you;
and all the favours done unto <hi>Therſander,</hi> was only to reclaim <hi>Damon</hi> from an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
affection; and my deſign in abſenting my ſelf from my Country, and my
friends, was only to ſeek out <hi>Damon</hi> under the Notion and Arms of the Knight of
the <hi>Tiger.</hi> Oh ye good Gods! (cryed out <hi>Damon</hi>) Never was Cavalier in
the world ſo happy as I am, ſince I have received theſe aſſurances from the mouth
of <hi>Madonthe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She would have replied, when <hi>Adamas</hi> miſtruſting the ſecurity of that place, and
fearing leſt the wounds of <hi>Damon</hi> ſhould grow worſe, he told <hi>Galathea,</hi> that he
thought it convenient to carry this Cavalier unto ſome place where his wounds
might be better dreſt, and ſince he was very weak, he deſired he might reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſome dayes in his houſe, becauſe it was the neereſt place of conveniency. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
made the Nymph conſent unto this motion; ſo as ſending unto ſome of the
Neighboring Hamblets, they got <hi>Damon</hi> to be carried unto the houſe of <hi>Adamas,</hi>
and the corps of <hi>Therſander</hi> unto the Town of <hi>Marſelles,</hi> to give it an honourable
Funeral. In the mean time <hi>Galathea</hi> advertiſed <hi>Amaſis</hi> by <hi>Lerindas,</hi> of all theſe
paſſages, beſeeching her that <hi>Damon</hi> might be put into ſome place of ſafety, which
when ſhe had done, ſhe would preſently come and receive her commands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Madonthe</hi> could not poſſibly chuſe but lament the loſs of poor <hi>Therſander,</hi> and
certainly it had coſt her many more tears had ſhe not met with <hi>Damon:</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
his long fidelity, affection, and ſervice, might well claim ſome tears for his
diſaſterous Fate, and in reward of all his pains, which ſhe did moſt zealouſly pay.
In the mean time, they began to carry away <hi>Damon,</hi> who turning his head every
way to ſee what <hi>Madonthe</hi> did, and ſpying the body of <hi>Therſander,</hi> he could not
chuſe but ſigh, not yet knowing whether he ſhould wiſh him alive or no. Yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that he dyed to ſave his life, his generoſity conſtrained him to ſay, Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
Friend, reſt contented, in that having <hi>Damon</hi> for thy enemy, thou haſt obliged
him to lament thy loſs, and to call thee his Friend. Upon this, he held out his hand
unto <hi>Madonthe,</hi> who came unto him, and never left him until he was in the houſe
of <hi>Adamas,</hi> although <hi>Galathea</hi> did moſt earneſtly deſire her to come into the
Coach, chuſing rather to follow <hi>Damon</hi> on foot, then to be one minute abſent from
him.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Adamas</hi> having preſented <hi>Daphnide, Alcidon,</hi> and the reſt
of their Company unto the Nymph, and ſhe receiving them with all expreſſions of
civility, that the trouble wherein ſhe was would permit; ſhe took them into her
Coach: as for <hi>Adamas,</hi> he would needs follow <hi>Damon,</hi> whom they carried a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way then the Coach was able to go. In the mean time <hi>Lerindas,</hi> leaving thoſe
that were to bring the corps of <hi>Therſander,</hi> he ran as faſt as he could before, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe
<hi>Amaſis,</hi> according to the inſtructions of <hi>Galathea;</hi> and though he ſaw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
perſons running up and down the fields on his left hand, and though he thought
them to belong unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> yet he went on, having a command to ſpeak unto
none but <hi>Amaſis:</hi> yet he whom <hi>Polemas</hi> had ſet as a ſpy upon the way, to obſerve
who paſſed, ran preſently unto him to acquaint him; and preſently after, another
brought him word that they ſaw a Company coming, who carried ſomthing like a
corps. <hi>Polemas</hi> who ſtayed there only to know the ſooner what was become of
<hi>Damon,</hi> did preſently beleeve, that is was he whom they brought dead, or at leaſt
wounded. And rejoycing much in himſelf, though ſeeming to be much troubled, he
walked ſoftly to the way, ſeeming ignorant of <hi>Galatheas</hi> removing from <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> he
asked thoſe who were with him, whom it might be whom they brought in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
None knew what to anſwer, becauſe he had not diſcovered his enterpriſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any about him, being more politique then to divulge thoſe deſign, which he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53527:125"/>
intended to execute: after he had walked a little farther, one of his men came and
told him, that it was one who was dead, whom <hi>Galathea</hi> had cauſed to be carried
unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and who was killed in her preſence within the next wood. Now
did he begin to think that the Souldiers had executed what they had promiſed, and
began to guſt all the ſweets of revenge; but it laſted no longer then till he met this
corps: for obſerving it to be the corps of no Cavalier, and asking where they found
that corps, and whither they carried it? The men anſwered, that <hi>Galathea</hi> had been
ſet upon by ſix Cavaliers, that one ſingle man had defeated them all: that this
Shepherd offering to aſſiſt was killed, but all the reſt lay dead upon the ground, and
that they carried the corps of this Shepherd unto <hi>Marſelles,</hi> by command of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi>
to be there honorably interred. But, ſaid <hi>Polemas,</hi> what is become of the
Cavalier that reſiſted all the reſt? He is much wounded, anſwered they, and is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
unto the houſe of the grand <hi>Druide. Polemas</hi> then ſeeming to know nothing
of the buſineſs: This it is (ſaid he as went away) to caſhier Souldiers without a
cauſe; I do verily believe, theſe are ſome of them that were caſhiered, who being
angry againſt <hi>Damon,</hi> did now ſeek to be revenged upon him in this wood; and
this he ſaid as a preparative to an excuſe when <hi>Galathea</hi> ſhould complain againſt him,
for he did imagine that the men would be all known. Then continuing ſtill his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
to take away all thoughts that he had any hand in the buſineſs; he preſently
diſpatched one of his men to congratulate <hi>Galathea</hi> from him, for the good Fortune
which <hi>Damon</hi> had in this Country, and commanded the man to take eſpecial notice
of all the words, and have an obſervant eye over all the actions of the Nymph.
And at the ſame time diſpatched another man to acquaint <hi>Amaſis</hi> with the accident,
beſeeching her not to ſuffer <hi>Galathea</hi> to go abroad any more alone, and without
ſuch guards as are fitting for her Grandeur: he alſo commanded this man to have
a ſpecial obſervance of all that <hi>Amaſis</hi> ſaid and did.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clidamant, Guyemant,</hi> and <hi>Lindamore,</hi> with moſt of the Cavalry in the
Country, being now in the Army of the <hi>Franks, Polemas</hi> ſtayed at home
as Lieutenant unto <hi>Amaſis,</hi> in the room of <hi>Clidamant;</hi> And an ambitious deſign
ſwelled him with hopes to make himſelf Lord of this Province; and yet conſidering
what abundance of difficulties he was to meet withall, in altering the Fundamental
Laws of a State, and in taking the whole frame from off its baſis, he thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
firſt, to try all wayes if he could marry <hi>Galathea,</hi> and left nothing invented
which might probably bring it to paſs: Now ſeeing but only two ways to compaſs
his deſign, the one by ſweetneſs, the other by violence, he would firſt try if he
could win her good will; and if that failed, then to have recourſe unto the faſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                     <p>In order to his firſt deſign, he would imploy that pretended <hi>Druide,</hi> called <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthes,</hi>
who had formerly told <hi>Galathea</hi> her Fortune, having an opinion, that
the Nymph had a Genius, very apt and inclinable to hearken unto ſuch impoſtures
and Novelties. He procured him therefore to ſet up his Cell again neer the Garden
of <hi>Mount Briſon</hi> where it was before; and ſetting all his things in better order as he
thought, then formerly; he ſhewed himſelf two or three dayes, in hopes that <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
would come and viſit him as before ſhe had done. And <hi>Polemas</hi> to make the
beſt uſe of the abſence of <hi>Clidamant</hi> and <hi>Lindamore</hi> he could, he provided himſelf of
many Souldiers in the Dominions of the <hi>Viſigots</hi> and <hi>Burgundians,</hi> who remained
quietly in the neighbouring Towns in expectation of his commands. He had already
courted himſelf into the amity of the neighbour Princes, by corrupting their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Officers; and was ſo liberal in the <hi>Seguſian</hi> Country, ſo Courteous both to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Souldiers, and ſo reſpective unto the <hi>Druides, Fubages, Sarronides, Vaces,</hi>
and other Sacrificers, as every one deſired nothing more then the marriage betwixt
<hi>Galathea</hi> and him, unleſs ſome few, who being wiſer then the reſt, did plainly ſee
that all this was not his nature, but only forced to compaſſe his ends in obtaining
Soveraign Power, which once gotten, he would not keep by the ſame means he
got it, but by more ſharp and Tyranique courſes. It was long before <hi>Amaſis</hi> could
ſee theſe things; becauſe an honeſt and good ſoul cannot imagine that a perſon obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
ſhould ever become ungrateful and traiterous. But at the laſt, ſhe began to
perceive it by a letter which dropped from him, in which ſhe found out what great
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53527:125"/>
intimacy there was betwixt <hi>Gond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>bant</hi> and him, and therefore aſſoon as <hi>Lerindas</hi>
told her of the accident which had hapned unto <hi>Damon,</hi> and that it was by the
Souldiers of <hi>Polemas,</hi> ſhe believed him to be the ſetter on; yet knowing how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
it is to ſhew any miſtruſt of a Prime Officer, before one be in a good capacity
to oppoſe him: when the Meſſenger of <hi>Polemas</hi> came to deliver his meſſage, ſhe
ſeemed very thankful unto him for the care he had of <hi>Galathea,</hi> and ſent him word
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ck, that his Counſel was ſo good, as ſhe would follow it in this and all things elſe;
And diſpatching away the Meſſenger, ſhe left <hi>Marſelles,</hi> and went unto the houſe
of <hi>Adamas</hi> with a good guard of Cavaliers to wait upon her: For the news which
ſhe had received from the Army of the <hi>Francks,</hi> did extreamly trouble her; and ſhe
feared that ſince it could not be long kept in ſecret, <hi>Polemas</hi> would reſolve upon
ſome ill deſign, as of late ſhe began to think he was apt to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galathea</hi> was no ſooner come to the houſe of <hi>Adamas,</hi> but the Meſſenger from
<hi>Polemas</hi> came alſo, and delivered the meſſage of his Maſter very bluntly unto her;
but ſhe not being able to hide the diſpleaſure which ſhe had conceived againſt him,
anſwered him very ſharply: Go and tell your Maſter, ſaid ſhe, that I am very much
diſpleaſed with thoſe that belong unto him; and if he do not take ſome better order,
I ſhall be very angry with him.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Damon</hi> was got into bed, and when the Chyrurgions ſearched
his wounds, they found them to be more painful then dangerous; For though he
was run through the Thigh in two or three ſeveral places, yet as happy luck was, no
Nerve nor Vein was hurt, which joyed <hi>Madonthe</hi> beyond all expreſſions. The
Chyrurgions knowing that the contentment of the mind was highly conducible to the
cure of the body, they intreated <hi>Madonthe</hi> not to ſtir from him; and becauſe ſhe
was deſirous he ſhould know all her adventures ſince ſhe came out of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> ſhe
did not only anſwer unto all his queſtions, but related all the plots and ſubtilties of
<hi>Leriana,</hi> which ſhe had contrived to the advantage of <hi>Therſander:</hi> But when ſhe
came to rehearſe the grief which ſhe conceived at his death, when <hi>Halladine</hi> brought
the Handkerchief full of blood unto <hi>Leriana,</hi> and <hi>Therſanders</hi> Ring unto her, ſhe
was not able to refrain from tears: then ſhe related the horrours of that ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
death which ſhe was to dye, and the unlookt for relief which ſhe received from
the Knight of the <hi>Tiger:</hi> And his departing unknown, continued ſhe, was the cauſe
of my reſolution to ſeek him out. But cruel <hi>Damon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, for I muſt give you
that Title, how could you find a heart to go away and never tell me who you were?
Why ſhould you after you had given life to my body, raviſh away the life of my
ſoul? Why would you not let me know you were alive? Oh <hi>Damon!</hi> how many
ſad ſighes, ſorrows and tears, had you ſpared me if you had? Afterward ſhe related
unto him her reſolution of ſeeking out this unknown Knight, whom ſhe was in queſt
of, though ſhe knew no reaſon, why ſhe ſhould be ſo earneſt after him: But the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
providence of Heaven would have it ſo, that I might find <hi>Damon</hi> under the
name of another: The truth is, continued ſhe, I had a far fetched conceipt, that I
ſhould find him thus, or elſe I ſhould never find him; and you ſee how happily God
brings all things about: <hi>Therſander</hi> was the firſt cauſe of our ſeparation, and <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>
is the laſt cauſe of our conjunction; how faithfully has he waited upon me,
and kept himſelf within the limits of a reſpectful diſtance, maugre all the falacies and
falſe hopes that <hi>Leriana</hi> had inſuſed into him; by which the beſt adviſed man might
well have been deluded? Upon this ſhe acquainted him how her Nurſe dyed at
<hi>Mount Dor;</hi> how ſhe met with <hi>Laonice, Hylas,</hi> and <hi>Tirsis;</hi> and how the <hi>Oracle</hi>
cauſed her to come into this Country, where ſhe had ſpent her time in the Company
of <hi>Aſtrea, Diana, Phillis,</hi> and other Shepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon,</hi> from whom ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
that morning, with a deſign of returning into <hi>Aquitane,</hi> and there ſpend
the reſt of her days amongſt the <hi>Veſtals</hi> and <hi>Druides</hi> Daughters. To be brief, ſhe
omitted nothing, but made a moſt faithful relation of every paſſage unto <hi>Damon,</hi>
who hearkned unto it with ſo much joy and contentment, as he knew not which way
to be thankful enough unto his good Fortune, for this favour: and after a while of
raviſhment in this contemplation, he ſaid unto her, I ſhall Madam another time
give you an exact relation of my life ſince I had the happineſs of ſeeing you laſt; but
at this time the Chyrurgions forbid me ſpeaking, and therefore I will not uſe any
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53527:126"/>
long diſcourſe, only let me tell you, that I hope our future Fortunes will be better
then they have been: For the Oracle which I conſulted with at <hi>Mount Verdun,</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me that I ſhould be reſtored from death to life by that man whom I moſt hated
and contemned: And ſee how this poor Cavalier brought you hither, where I find
you: For the Truth is, I might moſt rightly be ſaid to be dead when I was deprived
of you; and alive again in the happineſs of being with you; when I do conſider the
paſſage, I cannot chuſe but admire at the wiſe providence of the Great Gods, who
has ordered <hi>Therſander</hi> to give me a double life, the life of my body, by that relief
which he brought me, and the life of my ſoul, in conducting you Madam unto the
place where I was: There is only one doubt in the Oracle, which I do ſcruple at:</p>
                     <lg type="poem">
                        <head>The Oracle.</head>
                        <l>AND thou, O perfect Lover, when</l>
                        <l>Thou hear'ſt a Diamond ſpeak: Oh! then</l>
                        <l>From Death to Life thou ſhalt return,</l>
                        <l>By help of him whom thou didſt ſcorn.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>I ſee, (ſaid he) that all is moſt perfectly accompliſhed, except this hearing a
Diamond ſpeak, unleſs the Oracle will have me to take you Madam, for a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond

very attentively; Sir, ſaid he, and ſmiled, if I had been known unto you, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
of this Oracle would vaniſh: for my name is <hi>Adamas,</hi> which ſingifies in the
Roman Language a Diamond; ſo as this Oracle let you know, that as ſoon as you
hear me, this accident ſhall befall you; and ſo indeed it did: For at the very ſame
time that <hi>Alcidon, Daphnide,</hi> and I, came unto the place where you were, you met
with <hi>Madonthe.</hi> I muſt confeſs (ſaid <hi>Damon</hi>) the Oracle is fully cleered, and I am
moſt humbly thankful unto that Deity which ordained me this happineſs when I leaſt
expected it: But Reverend Father, continued he, and looked about the Chamber,
I heard you name two perſons, whom I infinitely eſteem, and ſhould think my ſelf
very happy to ſee in this place. Then <hi>Alcidon</hi> ſtepped to him, and imbracing him,
ſaid, yes <hi>Damon, Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> are here, and are conducted unto this
Country of wonders, by the ſame Love which brought you into it: At the ſame
time <hi>Daphnide</hi> came unto him, and ſaluting him, ſaid, yes, yes <hi>Damon, Madonthe</hi>
can tell you, that <hi>Daphnide</hi> is alſo here, and preſents her ſelf unto you under the
notion of one of your beſt Friends. <hi>Damon</hi> being ſurpriſed to ſee this Cavalier, and
this Lady, thus clad in the habit of Shepherds, he knew not at firſt whether he was
aſleep or awake; but afterwards touching them, and hearing them ſpeak, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
them, and cryed out; O <hi>Alcidon!</hi> I muſt needs confeſs with you, that this
Country is a Country of Wonders, but they are wonders full of joy and happineſs,
greater then ever I could hope to ſee. Whilſt <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> were ſaluting,
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> and they were all rejoycing together at their happy meeting, news was
brought unto <hi>Adamas</hi> that the Nymph <hi>Amaſis</hi> was entred into the Court; and he
was no ſooner out of the Chamber to meet her, but he found her at the door,
where after ſhe had ſtayed a little, ſhe entred into the room where <hi>Damon</hi> was: I
think, valiant Cavalier, ſaid ſhe unto him, that I ſhall never come to ſee you, but
ſhall find you thus unfortunately wounded. Madam, anſwered <hi>Damon,</hi> I ſhall never
complain againſt any of theſe wounds which I have received: For the firſt, gave me
the honour of ſeeing the Nymph <hi>Galathea,</hi> and then you Madam; and theſe laſt
have made me meet with her, who only in all the World can make me happy: ſo
as in lieu of complaining againſt this Country, I have cauſe to Love it, eſteem it, and
ſpeak well of it. Upon this <hi>Amaſis</hi> being informed of the quality of <hi>Madonthe,</hi> ſhe
went to embrace her, and careſs her according to her merits; and becauſe ſhe
took no notice of <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon;</hi> I perceive <hi>Madam,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Damon</hi> unto her)
that thoſe two perſons are unknown unto you, but be pleaſed to know, that they
are worth your acquaintance; for though you ſee them thus diſguiſed, yet Madam
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53527:126"/>
the one is <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and the other is <hi>Alcidon;</hi> the very ſame <hi>Daphnide</hi> whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
ſo much commanded the affection of the Great <hi>Eurick:</hi> And the very ſame <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon,</hi>
ſo Feared and Loved for his valour by <hi>Thoriſmond</hi> King of the <hi>Viſigots,</hi> and
all thoſe that ſucceeded him. <hi>Amaſis,</hi> upon this, gave him thanks for his advice,
and went to embrace them: It had been enough (ſaid ſhe) if you had only told me
their right names; for as ſoon as I had heard them, I ſhould preſently have known
theſe two to be the Great Favorites of King <hi>Eurick:</hi> But I muſt needs confeſs, that
ſeeing them thus habited, I ſhould not have known them for what they are, and
therefore I am obliged unto you for telling me. The obligation Madam, replied
<hi>Daphnide,</hi> is on our ſides, ſince he has made us known unto the greateſt, moſt
eſteemed, and honoured Nymph amongſt all the <hi>Gaules.</hi> But Sir, ſaid <hi>Amaſis</hi>
unto <hi>Alcidon,</hi> how came you to be thus diſguiſed? And where met you with this
Shepherds habit? The Story of it Madam, anſwered <hi>Alcidon,</hi> would be too long;
but I beſeech you, who can be in Forreſts and not become a Shepherd? The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is ſo full of accompliſhed Shepherds, and Fair Shepherdeſſes, as I rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that you Madam, and all your Nymphs, are not in the Habits of Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes.</p>
                     <p>I am very glad (anſwered the Nymph) that you have found any thing in this
Country which pleaſeth you; but when we have the happineſs to ſee you in <hi>Marſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
perhaps you will not think my Nymphs leſs lovely then the Shepherdeſſes, nor
find them in any humour of changing habits with them. Madam, (anſwered <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>)
I do not doubt of any thing you ſay; but I beſeech you give me leave to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and to ſay nothing unto what I do not yet know.</p>
                     <p>The Nymph had continued the diſcourſe longer, if ſhe had not been very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to have ſome talk with the ſage <hi>Adamas:</hi> and having held a long diſcourſe with
<hi>Galathea</hi> and him, upon the news which ſhe had received, ſhe went at laſt unto
<hi>Damon,</hi> and asked him how he did after his wounds were dreſſed? And underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he found himſelf much better, ſhe left him with <hi>Madonthe,</hi> ſaying ſhe
would not hinder them of their contentments in talking privately together: Then
ſhe commanded <hi>Silvia,</hi> and the reſt of the Nymphs, to entertain <hi>Daphnide</hi> and her
Company, and to ſhew <hi>Alcidon</hi> that the Nymphs of <hi>Marſelles</hi> do not yeild unto
the Shepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon.</hi> Upon this taking <hi>Adamas</hi> by one hand, and <hi>Galathea</hi>
by another, ſhe went into the Gallery, where the doors being all ſhut, ſhe took
a whole turn before ſhe began to ſpeak: afterwards aſſuming another look more
ſerious then before, and ſeeming to be much troubled, ſhe turned her ſelf toward
<hi>Adamas</hi> and ſpoke thus.</p>
                     <p>Father (ſaid ſhe) I have things of great importance to impart unto you; and you
muſt give me that Faithful and Prudent Counſel, which you were always wont:
and becauſe I may perhaps forget ſome material paſſages, I deſire that he who
brought me the news, may make the relation of it unto you, if we have but as much
time afterwards as to return unto <hi>Marſelles:</hi> Madam, anſwered <hi>Adamas,</hi> I pray
Heaven you be not miſtaken in my Prudence, and I dare anſwer for my fidelity;
and as for your return unto <hi>Marſelles,</hi> I ſhall hope that unleſs your haſte be very
great, you will honour me and my houſe ſo much as to ſtay this night in it: Father,
(anſwered <hi>Amaſis</hi>) if the urgency of my affairs would permit it, I ſhould be very
willing; but when you ſhall hear what the Cavalier will ſay whom <hi>Lindamore</hi> ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, you will not judg it convenient: Then cauſing <hi>Galathea</hi> to call in the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
whom <hi>Lindamore</hi> ſent, and the doors being ſhut, pray Sir, ſaid ſhe unto the
Cavalier, make us a relation of all the meſſage which <hi>Lindamore</hi> has ſent unto me,
and omit not any particular either concerning our affairs, or the affairs of <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
and <hi>Guyemant,</hi> ſince they are ſo linked together, that they can hardly be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
Upon this, placing the Cavalier between her ſelf and <hi>Adamas,</hi> and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Galathea</hi> in her other hand, they all walked together; and the Cavalier in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to her commands, with a deep ſigh, began thus.</p>

                     <p>The King <hi>Merovius</hi> who by the grandure of his actions has got the Title of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
among the <hi>Franks;</hi> and in their own Language <hi>Mervoch,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

and <hi>Almaines,</hi> as over the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Burgundians;</hi> and after he had Reigned
twelve years, he died full of glory, and lamented by the people, leaving by his wiſe
<hi>Methina,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Stuffart</hi> King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> and Predeceſſor of <hi>Atillas,</hi>
ſurnamed <hi>the Scourge of God,</hi> only one Son whoſe name is <hi>Childerick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reputation of the Father, and the Love which he had got amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
moved all the <hi>Franks</hi> with a common conſent to make choiſe of <hi>Childerick</hi> the
Son; and having ſet upon his head a double Crown, the one to intimate his ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the other to ſpeak the conqueſts of his Father, they carried him upon
their ſhoulders throughout all the ſtreets of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and proclaimed him King of the
<hi>Franks:</hi> before him went the Heralds of Arms, carrying in their hands Enſignes
won by <hi>Merovius</hi> from the <hi>Huns, Gepides, Alaines, Burgundians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> all
which they trailed upon the ground: after followed the Enſignes of the <hi>Franks,</hi>
which were ſemi-Flower de Luces in an Azure Field: and laſt of all followed the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
of <hi>Merovius</hi> his Father; The firſt was a <hi>Lion</hi> endeavouring to mount a ſteep
Hill to devour an Eagle which ſate upon the top, with this motto; <hi>With Paines is
the Prey obtained;</hi> and another was a Crown upon a Buckler, with this motto: <hi>A
Buckler ſecures a Crown.</hi> Thus going Triumphantly through all the ſtreets, the
Air did Eccho with the loud acclamations of the People and Souldiers: Bonfires
blazed befory every door, and when they were extinguiſhed, great Wax Tapers
burned all the night before every mans houſe, and nothing but dancing and joy
could be ſeen in the ſtreets; Tables ſumptuouſly furniſhed were ſet out for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers:
And it is impoſſible for me Madam, to expreſs the great hopes that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had in this young King: looking upon him as the Son of <hi>Merovius,</hi> whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
was yet ſo freſh, that all his great victories ſeemed to be before their eyes, and
the generous actions of the Father made them hope for the ſame from the Son, both
in matter of Arms, and management of publique affairs. But he quickly ſhewed
them that Dominion is a place ſo ſlippery, that few perſons can attain to it, and
fewer can find firm footing without a fall: For in a ſhort time after he was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he began to lay Arms aſide, and addict himſelf unto all manner of pleaſures; not
remembring that it was the magnanimity, and martial exploits of his predeceſſors,
which had promoted them unto that Dominion: ſo as now the Court was quite
changed and ſwarmed with eſſeminate Sycophants, whilſt valiant and brave minds
had nothing to do, but ſtand with their hands in their pockets; young Gallants
who under <hi>Merovius</hi> began to bud in valour, are now after the example of <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
turned women, and look not like the ſame men they promiſed to be. So as all
the hopes of conqueſt were turned unto fears, leſt the ſtate which they had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſhould revolt; and the utmoſt limits of all their hopes was only to keep what
they had already gotten. <hi>Clidamant, Lindamore,</hi> and <hi>Guyemant,</hi> were much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
at the alteration of this Prince, eſpecially <hi>Guyemant,</hi> as one moſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and one who had devoted all his ſervices unto this King. So as when <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:53527:127"/>
adviſed <hi>Clidamant</hi> to return into his own Country, becauſe this Prince was ſo
drowned in pleaſures, that there was no more glory to be got by ſtaying there,
<hi>Gayemant</hi> with tears in his eyes diſſwaded him, ſaying, that if any thing under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
would awake <hi>Childerick</hi> from his drowſie ſecurity, it would be the generoſity
and virtue of <hi>Clidemant;</hi> and if ſo much happineſs befel the <hi>Franks</hi> by his means,
he would get more glory by it then any other way: beſides, he was to conſider, that
he having aſſiſted <hi>Merovius</hi> againſt ſo many potent enemies, it would torn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
to his diſ-advantage if he did not alſo aſſiſt <hi>Childerick,</hi> having made many
Princes his enemies by taking part with the <hi>Franks. Clidemant</hi> who was a generous
Prince, and who did love the perſon of <hi>Childerick,</hi> he was eaſily perſwaded to ſtay
with him, and ſo ſtopped his eares againſt the ſound advice of <hi>Lindamore,</hi> as all his
prudent propoſitions proved fruitleſs.</p>
                     <p>There was in the Court a young Cavalier called <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> Son unto one of
the moſt valiant Heroes of all the <hi>Franks:</hi> he had the honour to be educated with
this young Prince, when he was ſo young, as he was not fit to follow <hi>Merovius</hi> in
the Army. This <hi>Andrimartes</hi> with many other children of the Prime Cavaliers, were
continually with young <hi>Childerick,</hi> and inſtructed in all manner of Noble exerciſes,
that might make them fit to ſerve their Prince and Country. And theſe yourhs were
not only taught in all things requiſite unto courage and war, but alſo in all things
that might poliſh their minds, and temper the Natural Ferocity of the old Sicam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians,
and the inhabitants of the <hi>Meotidan</hi> Lake. Alſo to render them more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
unto the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who are a people the moſt civilized of all <hi>Europe,</hi> they were
very often amongſt the young Ladies, which belonged unto the Queen <hi>Methina,</hi>
and there was ſuch pritty familiants amongſt them, as they would propound ſeveral
marriages amongſt themſelves: this Queen had command from the prudent <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
her Husbandi to entertain as many of the <hi>Gaul</hi> Ladies as ſhe could, deſigning
by this way to make himſelf King of the <hi>Gaules</hi> by Love as well as by Arms.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt thoſe that were thus entertained and educated during the infancy of
<hi>Childerick, Silviana</hi> had the firſt place, as well in reſpect of her merit, as of her
family from whence ſhe was extracted: This young Lady was adorned with all ſuch
qualities as have power to cauſe Love; both Fortune and Nature had equally been
favourable unto her: And beſides her beauty which was very high, ſhe had a wit ſo
ſweet, as all thoſe whom her eyes attracted, were held by her courteſy, and ſweet
converſation. This young Lady was not yet above ten or eleven years of age; and
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> who was about thirteen or fourteen, did caſt an amorous glance upon
her: <hi>Silviana</hi> was eſteemed the only Star about the Queen <hi>Methina;</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes</hi>
amongſt all thoſe about <hi>Childerick</hi> carried away the commendations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for dancing, leaping, or any other exerciſe of the body. Moreover he was of
ſuch a ſweet and tractable diſpoſition, that when he got the better of any of his
Companions, he was ſo far from inſulting, that none was ſorry to be ſurmounted by
him, but very willing to yeild unto him that glory which was his due.</p>
                     <p>At this age the young <hi>Andrimartes</hi> began to caſt an eye upon the Fair <hi>Silviana,</hi>
who being ſuch a beauty as could not be looked upon and not loved, he began to
court her, and give her ſuch teſtimonies of his affections as his green age could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.
Shee, who yet hardly knew the name of Love, received his boyiſh ſervices,
as other children uſe to do, without any further deſign: yet in a little time ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to like him better then any of the reſt, and reſented ſomthing which inclined
her to talk with him, and to be glad when he was with her from all the reſt of her
companions, though this inclination yet could not be phraſed either love or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in her: But as the longer one ſtands by a fire, the more heat he feels; ſo <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes</hi>
could not hold ſuch intimate familiarity with <hi>Silviana,</hi> without kindling
ſuch ſparks of Love, as at length ſo inflamed his ſoul, that neither time nor any
thing elſe could extinguiſh them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt time that he made it known unto her, was one evening when the Queen
<hi>Methina,</hi> according to her cuſtome, went to walk upon the banks of <hi>Seine:</hi> for ſhe
reſided moſt at <hi>Paris,</hi> as well becauſe it was the center of the conqueſts of <hi>Merovius,</hi>
as by reaſon of an Oracle, which was lately received from the Temple of <hi>Ijis,</hi> and
which ſaid thus:
<q>
                           <pb n="50" facs="tcp:53527:128"/>
                           <l>WHen <hi>Paris</hi> is the Prime of Gaul,</l>
                           <l>A Gauliſh ſtranger govern ſhall.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Merovius</hi> and the <hi>Franks</hi> thought that their Anceſtors being <hi>Gaules,</hi> this
Oracle was ſpoken of them; and I aſſure my ſelf that Madam you know how this
delectable River of <hi>Seine</hi> runs round about that City. And when the Queen went
to walk upon the banks of it, all the Ladies and Cavaliers waited upon her, and
walked alſo two and two, where and how they pleaſed. One evening therefore after
ſupper, <hi>Methina</hi> went to take the Air, and <hi>Andrimartes</hi> taking <hi>Silviana</hi> under her
arm, he entertained her as he was wont with his young affections, unto which ſhe
anſwered in as innocent Language, as infancy it ſelf could imagine: As they were
wandering amongſt the thick of the wood, they ſate down at the firſt under an old
Willow, which grew by the River ſide; but the young Lady, not liking to ſtay too
long in a place, and being weary with ſitting, ſhe roſe up and went unto a little
tree of Oſiers; and making choiſe of one whoſe bark was ſmooth and tender, ſhe
had a mind to engrave her name upon it; ſo as taking a Gold Bodkin which ſhe
wore in her hair, ſhe engraved the Letters of <hi>Silviana. Andrimartes</hi> ſeeing what
ſhe began to do, he went upon the other ſide of the tree, and write upon the ſame
ſtalk, as if it were in the very ſame line, theſe words, <hi>I Love:</hi> ſo as what he writ,
meeting with what <hi>Silviana</hi> had written, both together made, <hi>I Love Silviana:</hi>
but ſhe going on his ſide, ſhe could ſee only what he had written; how <hi>Andrimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
ſaid ſhe, do you Love? I beſeech you who? You may ſee Madam, (ſaid he
unto her) if you will pleaſe to read on the Line: For my part, (ſaid ſhe) I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what you have written; look a little better Madam, (ſaid he) and you
may find that which is engraved upon my heart, as well as upon that bark: where
is the name, ſaid ſhe, that you ſpeak of? Look well, ſaid <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and you
will find it not far off: I do not underſtand you, anſwered ſhe, for I ſee nothing
but that which you writ; what then is this? (anſwered <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and pointed
unto what ſhe had engraved) That is <hi>Silviana,</hi> (anſwered ſhe) Then, ſaid <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes,</hi>
joyn what I writ, and what you writ, together. I ſee, replied ſhe, that
by joyning them together, there is, <hi>I Love Silviana;</hi> but it was my ſelf that wrote
it: Moſt true, anſwered <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and it is you who has engraven it in my
heart. Your heart, replied ſhe, and wondred, how could I do that, for I never
ſaw your heart? I know not Madam how you did it, anſwered he, but I am ſure
that with you Fair Eyes you have done it. Fie, fie, (cryed ſhe out) I cannot believe it,
for my eyes cannot engrave, or if they could, I ſhould ſurely have ſeen when they
did it; had they that quality, I ſhould not have uſed my Bodkin to engrave upon
this bark. This childiſh anſwer did plainly ſhew <hi>Andrimartes</hi> how ignorant ſhe was
in matters of Love: yet for all that, he continued on; It is no wonder Madam, ſaid
he, that your Fair Eyes cannot engrave your Name upon a bark, becauſe it is a
thing inſenſible; but ſaid ſhe, I have often looked upon the Queens little dogs,
which ſhe loves ſo well, and can you find one letter of my Name upon them? No,
no, replied he, they are animals without reaſon; it is only upon the hearts of men,
and men who are moſt worthy of that character. How? ſaid <hi>Silviana,</hi> can I do it
and not perceive it? I beſeech you Madam, ſaid <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> do you perceive your
ſelf to grow? Alas, ſaid ſhe, I do that naturally; and you do naturally, replied <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes,</hi>
make wounds in hearts. Oh my good God, replied ſhe, I have heard
ſay that all wounds upon the heart are mortal; and if my eyes have wounded yours,
I ſhall be the cauſe of your death, and you will have all the reaſon in the world to
hate me: Tis moſt certain, replied he, that all wounds upon the heart are mortal,
and thoſe which you have given me will cauſe my death, unleſs you give me a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
but however, I cannot hate you, ſince on the contrary, I think that I cannot love
you ſo much as I deſire, and as you deſerve. I conceive the beſt way will be, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the young <hi>Silviana</hi>) that ſince my eyes do hurt you ſo much, to hide them
from you for the future. By no means Madam I beſeech you, anſwered he, unleſs
you would have me die, as ſoon as you begin that mortal remedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for you muſt know,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53527:128"/>
that if any thing under Heaven can ſave my life, it muſt be by giving me new
wounds. This remedy, (ſaid the young <hi>Silviana</hi>) is very ſtrange, and leaſt you
ſhould dye, I will not only do as you ſay, but deſire all my companions to do the
ſame, in hopes that the multitude of wounds which their eyes do make, may eaſe
you in thoſe you receive from me: The eyes of your companions (anſwered he)
can neither hurt nor heal me: what difference (ſaid ſhe) do you find betwixt my eyes
and theirs? For my part, I know not any. There is ſo much, replied <hi>Andrimartes,</hi>
That I had rather be dead then want the leaſt wound which I have from you, and I
would accord theirs as much as I can. I do not underſtand (ſaid ſhe) why you
ſhould think ſo; for wounds are wounds, from whomſoever they be received. There
are (replied <hi>Andrimartes</hi>) wounds that are honourable and pleaſing, and others
that are ignominious and painful: thoſe which I receive from you are of the firſt
ſort; and thoſe which your companions can give are of the other. I cannot imagine
(anſwered the young <hi>Silviana</hi>) what the difference ſhould be. If there were other
<hi>Silvianas</hi> (ſaid <hi>Andrimartes</hi>) as Fair and full of Excellencies as you are, and as able
by their beauty to make ſuch welcom wounds, I ſhould then agree with you that
they would be all deſirable alike; but ſince that cannot be, aſſure your ſelf Madam,
I ſhall think nothing to be a favour or a remedy which comes not from your Faireſt
ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silviana</hi> was very young, and yet not ſo young, but hearing <hi>Andrimartes</hi> ſpeak
thus, ſhe underſtood his good will unto her; for ſelf love is ſo natural unto us, that
nothing does oblige more, at what age ſoever, then a good eſteem which is held of
us; and that made him to return this anſwer: the good opinion which you have of
me, moves you unto this language; but believe it <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> you are as much
obliged unto it by the good opinion which I have of you. Perhaps their diſcourſe
had gone farther, but for the coming of <hi>Childerick,</hi> who with a great number of
young boyes came running and leaping through thoſe woods, and parted them;
for this young Prince carried away <hi>Andrimartes</hi> almoſt by force to leap and exerciſe
with his companions, as he who excelled them all in agility and nimbleneſs. He left
the Fair <hi>Silviana</hi> with an ill will, and ſhe remained alone with no leſs diſpleaſure;
for though till then ſhe never had the leaſt reſentment of Love, yet theſe laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
infuſed ſtrange imaginations into her fancy; and preſently after, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
upon the merits and perfections of the young <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and calling into
memory the expreſſions of his particular good will unto her: Love did begin ſo
gently to ſcratch the skin, that it became ſuch an itch, as by degrees became a
wound incurable.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as ever <hi>Andrimartes</hi> could ſteal away from <hi>Childerick,</hi> he returned to
<hi>Silviana,</hi> begging a thouſand pardons for leaving her alone, and excuſing it with
the force which that young Prince uſed unto him. I cannot blame him, anſwered
<hi>Silviana,</hi> nor your friends, for deſiring the happineſs of your company. Oh Madam,
anſwered <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that you would rank your ſelf in that number, and think
it a happineſs to have my company. Do you doubt of either? (replied <hi>Silviana</hi>)
No, no, <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> you have merits enow, to make all become your friends, and
deſire your company, and I have known you too long not to eſteem them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
Madam (anſwered he) I ſhould think this evening the happieſt time of all
my life, could I think the Fair <hi>Silviana</hi> did ever daign to caſt her Fair eye upon my
actions, and if I could have any aſſurance in what you are now pleaſed to ſay. The
young <hi>Silviana,</hi> not dreaming that Love would oblige a heart to give it ſelf away,
but thinking it only a piece of pleaſing complaiſance and delight in the company of
one perſon with another, ſhe did believe that <hi>Andrimartes</hi> did Love her, and alſo
did intend to Love him, as a Siſter may Love a Brother, or a Daughter a Father;
and therefore according to the innocency of her age, and ſimplicity of her ſoul, ſhe
anſwered him thus. Be aſſured <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that I do really Love you; and
whereas you deſire to have ſome aſſurance of my words, I will moſt willingly give
it, proteſting unto you, that I do not Love any Brother ſo well as I do you. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes</hi>
who was older, and more capable of Love then ſhe, did know very well
that all this was but the words of a child; yet thinking that he had already brought
her to a very good paſſe, he contented himſelf for that time, hoping that time and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53527:129"/>
continuance of his Courtſhip would work this innocent Love into ſuch a perfect af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
as he deſired; and therefore taking her hand, he kiſſed it, and with a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
look ſaid, Now Madam, do I think my ſelf the moſt happy and beſt contented
man alive, ſince I have received this declaration from you, which I deſire above all
the world: only one thing more I beſeech you Madam let me beg, which is, that
you will be conſtant unto this aſſurance which you have given me, and that you will
be pleaſed to let me bear the name of your Brother, and to call you Siſter, as an
obligation unto us to continue in this amity: With all my heart (anſwered the
young Lady) and I do promiſe to Love and eſteem you as much as if you were my
Brother. <hi>Andrimartes</hi> would have anſwered, had it not began to rain, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them both to remove: however, ſince that day, he courted this young and Fair
Lady ſo cloſe, as by degrees he taught her know, that Love was not to be confined
by the Laws of Friendſhip, nor kept within compaſs of a meer good will; for in a
few days ſhe loved him in ſuch a height, as ſhe perceived it to be a thing impoſſible
for her to make a retreat: So as one day when ſhe met him upon the banks of <hi>Seine,</hi>
where <hi>Methina,</hi> according to her cuſtom, was walking, and taking an occaſion to
retire themſelves under a ſhade of Trees, ſhe ſaid thus unto him; Do you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
brother (for ſo ſhe called him) what diſcourſe we had in this place, when I
engraved my name upon the bark of yonder Tree? Doubtleſs I do Siſter, (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Andrimartes</hi>) and ſhall remember it as long as I live: no time is able to deſace
it out of my memory; for it was then I received my greateſt hopes of happineſs
from you. What did I then ſay, replied ſhe, which gave you ſo much contentment?
Theſe Madam, anſwered he, were your own words; Be aſſured <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that
I do really Love you. Brother (ſaid <hi>Silviana</hi>) will you have me confeſs the truth
unto you? I would have you believe (ſaid ſhe and ſmiled) that when I ſpoke thoſe
words I knew not what I ſaid: how Siſter! replied he preſently, not know what
you ſaid? Certainly I did not, anſwered ſhe, for how could I give you aſſurance of
a thing which I was ignorant of, and did not know? Then, ſaid he unto her, you
did deceive me: 'Tis true indeed (ſaid <hi>Silviana</hi>) I did deceive you; but it was
when I was firſt deceived my ſelf: for I muſt confeſs, that when I ſaid I did Love
you, I did not know what it was to Love; and yet the good will which I had unto
you, did make me think it was Love, which was only a childiſh kind of an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> hearing her ſay ſo, he was a little ſtartled, fearing that ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to break her promiſe with this excuſe: But ſhe who had other intentions ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him ſo mute, and ſuſpecting the cauſe of his ſilence; Brother (ſaid ſhe) be not
troubled at what I ſay, for it is only to give you a fuller aſſurance of that affection
which I have unto you; let me tell you now, that I am more knowing then I was
then; and am better able to diſcern your merits and affection to me: I know now
what it is to Love; not only as a Brother, but as <hi>Andrimartes;</hi> and knowing this,
I do proteſt unto you, that I do Love you as well as you ought to deſire. <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes</hi>
hearing this welcom expreſſion, kneeled down upon the ground, and ſaid;
Should I employ all my dayes in thanks Madam, and ſpend all my blood in doing
you ſervice, I were not able to recompence you for this happineſs which you have
conferred upon me by this declaration: but ſince you are pleaſed to be ſo infinitely
good, give me leave to beg, that you will alſo be pleaſed to compleat this my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
What is it, ſaid <hi>Silviana,</hi> that I can ſay more? Have I not profeſſed that
now I do know what it is to Love, and that I do Love <hi>Andrimartes</hi> as much as he
ought to deſire? I deſire a little more Madam, anſwered he, for perhaps you may
ſay that I ought not to deſire ſo much as I do. Then <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> anſwered ſhe,
I do Love you as much as I oght to do: yet a little more, good Madam, anſwered
he, for there is not amongſt men that can aſſume ſo much honour to himſelf as to
ſay that you ought to Love him: Then replied ſhe, I do Love <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> as well
as he does Love me: upon this, <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was ſatisfied. Now, ſaid <hi>Silviana,</hi> I
will go further, and do more then you deſire; for I do Love <hi>Andrimartes</hi> more
then he Loves me: and I vow by all the Nymphs and Deities of the River, that I will
never Love any elſe: Only one thing Brother I ſhall requeſt, which is, that you
will promiſe me upon your Faith, never to deſire of me any thing which my honour
and decency may not allow. Let all the torments of Hell fall upon my head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anſwered
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53527:129"/>
                        <hi>Andrimartes</hi> preſently, and may Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> blaſt all my hopes and deſires, if ever I
do entertain the leaſt thought of offering beyond thoſe Limits which you ſhall freely
allow me.</p>
                     <p>When this diſcourſe paſſed betwixt them, <hi>Silviana</hi> was about thirteen or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of age, and <hi>Andrimartes</hi> about ſixteen or ſeventeen, an age ſo apt to
take all amorous impreſſions, that Love did imprint in their young hearts all the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of it ſelf: ſo as ever ſince that time, they did both ſo grow in affection, that
had not their young and familiar education together been an umbrage for all their
amorous actions, and ſhadowed them with a vail of courteſy and long acquaintance,
certainly many had taken notice of it: but ſince this familiarity did begin when they
were little children, none did wonder at their kindneſs unto each other, eſpecially
both of them being yet but very young.</p>
                     <p>Thus they did live together in all poſſible ſatisfaction and contentment, waiting
until ſuch time as they could handſomly procure the conſent of their Parents unto a
marriage. And this happy condition laſted until ſuch time as <hi>Childerick</hi> did unlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
caſt his eye upon this ſhinning Star: for ſeeing her at a Ball where <hi>Silviana</hi> was
diſguiſed, according to the cuſtom of the Romans, he took ſuch a liking to her, that
ever ſince he loved her moſt deſperately: <hi>Silviana</hi> took notice of it preſently; and
becauſe ſhe thought it would be a ſin unpardonable in her, if ſhe did not impart all
that ſhe knew unto her dear Brother, as ſoon as ever ſhe ſaw him, ſhe acquainted
him with all paſſages: <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was apt to believe it; Siſter, (ſaid he unto
her) it is no wonder if all the World do Love you; but muſt your ambition to be
the Miſtris of a Kings Son, extinguiſh your affection unto a Brother? And muſt I
be the widdowed Turtle left deſolate without a Companion? Brother, (ſaid ſhe
then unto him, and took his hand) be aſſured that you ſhall never be the Turtle
which you ſpeak of, until death do raviſh me from you: and if I thought any ſuch
doubt did enter into your ſoul, the affection which I bear unto you would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
angry: be confident <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that death it ſelf ſhall not alter my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
for I will preſerve it unto that ſecond life, which our <hi>Druides</hi> tell us of
after this: Here Brother, (ſaid ſhe) take this Ring; and if you be the ſame <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes,</hi>
which I take you to be, ſummon me by it either in this or the next life, to
keep that promiſe which now I do moſt ſolemnly confirm for ever unto you.</p>
                     <p>I want words, Madam, wherewith to expreſs the joyes of young <hi>Andrimartes;</hi>
he fell down upon his knees, he kiſſed her hand, and the Ring which ſhe gave him, a
hundred times, with a vow to preſent it unto her at that time when ſhe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him. Then taking a pin and pricking that finger whereon he wore the Ring, he
cauſed it to bleed in ſeveral places, and making his handkerchief all bloody, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it unto <hi>Silviana:</hi> Madam (ſaid he unto her) I do ſeal the vow which I have
made with my blood, and I conjure you to reſtore me this handkerchief when you
command me to reſtore unto you this Ring; to the end that by theſe marks both
the living and the dead may know how great the affection is which <hi>Andrimartes</hi>
bears unto <hi>Silviana,</hi> and how happy this affection has been above its merits, in
meeting with her reciprocal affection. Thus did Love link the hearts of theſe two
young Lovers together with faſter knots, as if all the powers upon earth were not
able to unty them.</p>
                     <p>But for all that, <hi>Childerick</hi> continued his begun Love, which grew to that height,
that he could not enjoy any contentment nor reſt, but when he was with her. At the
firſt, leſt <hi>Merovius</hi> ſhould be advertiſed of it, he hid his paſſion as much as he
could, and this was the reaſon why he durſt not in words declare it unto <hi>Silviana,</hi>
though all his actions did make it ſo apparent unto every one, as it was a thing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
to tell her that which none was ignorant of.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time, taking infinite delight in looking upon her, he commanded
an Artiſt to take her Picture unknown unto her, thinking that ſhe would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it otherwiſe: and the Picture-drawer was ſo ready to ſatisfie this young Prince,
as he took her Picture very exquiſitely, at two or three times ſeeing her in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
when <hi>Childerick</hi> ſaw it, he kiſſed it a thouſand times; and thinking that his
happineſs was not compleat unleſs <hi>Silviana</hi> did know what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ewel he poſſeſſed, and
meeting her in the Anti-chamber of the Queen his Mother, he took her aſide and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53527:130"/>
ſaid thus unto her; Fair <hi>Silviana,</hi> I can tel you ſome news, which perhaps you are
ignorant of; for you think your ſelf to be the only Daughter of your Mother, yet
let me tell you, that you have a Siſter: Did I think this news to be true, Sir, ſaid
<hi>Silviana,</hi> I ſhould think it the beſt that ever I heard, and think my ſelf much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
unto you for telling me of it. You have good reaſon to be glad of it (ſaid <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>)
for though ſhe be not ſo fair as you are, yet ſhe does very much reſemble
you; and becauſe your ſelf ſhall be judge whether or no I ſpeak the truth, pray look
upon this. As ſoon as ever <hi>Silviana</hi> ſaw it, ſhe preſently knew it, and ſtarted to
ſee her ſelf in any other hands then thoſe of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and deſiring to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, he gave it unto her. After ſhe had a while looked upon it, and not knowing
how to get it handſomly from him; ſhe threw it into the fire, and it was burned
before <hi>Childerick</hi> took notice of it, yet ſhe did not caſt it into the fire ſo ſoon, as ſhe
repented of her haſte, when ſhe ſaw that young Prince ſtand as if he were planet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck
with amazement, and to excuſe her ſelf in ſome ſort: Oh God Sir, ſaid ſhe,
it was ſo ill-favouredly done, that I could not endure to ſee my ſelf ſo ugly. <hi>Silviana,</hi>
anſwered <hi>Childerick,</hi> you have angered me to the ſoul, and I cannot tell whether
I have patience enough to endure it. Sir, anſwered <hi>Silviana,</hi> and bluſht; I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ſorry for it: but the truth is, it was ſo very ill done, that I had rather have
ſeen the Picture of death then it. Love and anger had now a great debate in the
heart of this offended Prince; but Love, at laſt triumphing; I ſhall ſee (ſaid he)
whether that was your reaſon or no, or whether you did it as an affront unto me;
for if it be as you ſay, then you will permit that another be taken with more leiſure,
that the Artiſt may do it better then he could the firſt: but if you deny me this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
then I have reaſon to think that you did it by way of affront, and that you
ſcorn a Prince who never adored any but your ſelf. The young <hi>Silviana</hi> fearing the
diſpleaſure of her friends, was conſtrained to grant what he deſired in ſuch a civil
and courteous manner, as he could not chuſe but be very well contented with this
ſatisfaction. Will you permit (ſaid the Prince) that another Picture may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?
Sir, anſwered ſhe, I will permit any thing you pleaſe as far as is in me; but
doubtleſs the Queen will take it very ill if I ſhould ſuffer it without her permiſſion, or
at leaſt without the permiſſion of my governeſs. It is enough, ſaid <hi>Childerick,</hi> that
I know I have your conſent unto what I deſire, and that you threw the Picture into
the fire, only becauſe it was ill done. And becauſe ſhe ſeemed to be much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at her ſo much diſpleaſing him, laſt ſome by-ſtanders ſhould take notice of it,
he himſelf confeſſed that it was indeed ſo ill drawn, that it deſerved no leſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then the fire.</p>
                     <p>If this Picture were good for nothing elſe, yet it ſerved this young Prince to make
his Love known unto <hi>Silviana,</hi> for this young Lady durſt not but receive all that he
ſaid with a favourable aſpect, laſt otherwiſe he ſhould complain againſt her for caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Picture ſo haſtily in the fire: and continuing ſtill his Courtſhip, he omitted
no occaſion which might teſtifie the grandeur of his affection to her: and becauſe it
is extream hard for the violent paſſion of Love to be confined unto the limits of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and diſcretion, it ſo increaſed, that very often tranſgreſſing the Laws of modeſty,
it hapned one day hearing her ſing, that he was ſo tranſported with this puiſſant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Love, that though it was amongſt many Ladies and Cavaliers, yet he could
not forbear from kiſſing her <hi>per</hi> force. <hi>Silviana</hi> having no inclination at all unto
<hi>Childerick,</hi> ſeemed to be extreamly offended with him for this violence, and ſeeing
it was done in the face of all the Court, ſhe made many great complaints againſt
him; and the rather, becauſe <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was preſent, unto whom ſhe would not
give the leaſt thought, that the Courtſhip of <hi>Childerick</hi> was able to alter her from
her vowed reſolution. But the young Prince, though he ſaw her much offended,
yet he turned all to rallary, and laughed it out,</p>
                     <p>But yet <hi>Silviana</hi> would not take the continuation of his Love as in jeſt; and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes,</hi>
as good a face as he ſet upon the matter, yet was he netled to ſee his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
become his Rival; knowing very well that Love and Dominion will not admit
of any Companions: and therefore he reſolved to ask the Queens conſent to marry
<hi>Silviana;</hi> but becauſe he would not do any thing that might diſpleaſe <hi>Silviana,</hi> he
did communicate this reſolution unto her, which ſhe approved of very well, as well
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53527:130"/>
(ſaid ſhe) to be out of the Tiranny of <hi>Childerick,</hi> as that we may afterwards live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
freely without any conſtraint. <hi>Andrimartes</hi> therefore whoſe only deſire was
to be the ſole poſſeſſor of his Fair and dear <hi>Silviana,</hi> made it his ſute unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he might not longer trifle away his time amongſt a company of boys,
but rather imploy i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> nobly in the way of Arms under <hi>Merovius,</hi> to the honour of
his Family, and after their examples, eſpecially his own: for he was now aſhamed to
be alwayes amongſt none but boyes and women: and therefore humbly deſired him
that he might leave off the name of child, and aſſume the name of a <hi>Frank,</hi> in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of his predeceſſors, and after his own particular example, his humour and his
age prompting him thereunto. The Father who had a generous ſoul, ſeeing his
Son ſo inclinable unto Arms, was very glad to find this generous diſpoſition in him,
and promiſed to give full ſatisfaction unto his deſire; and to defer it no longer, he
acquainted <hi>Merovius</hi> with it, who approving of it, made it known unto <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
and intended to honour him with the order of Knighthood, and with all thoſe
Ceremonies of gird<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng him with a Sword, and putting on a Spur, in imitation of
<hi>Arthur</hi> King of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> when he admitted young Cavaliers into the Rank
of Knights, <hi>Childerick</hi> who was extreamly in Love with the Fair <hi>Silviana,</hi> was
very glad of this honour intended unto <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> in hopes, that as ſoon as he
was become a Knight of Arms, he would be conſtrained to go into the Army, and
leave <hi>Silviana</hi> ſolely unto him, whoſe favour he hoped more eaſily to obtain wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n
this young man was out of her eye, who he ſaw wiſhed him very well. Every thing
thus favouring the deſign of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> he was dubbed a Knight by the hands of
<hi>Childerick,</hi> who had received the ſame honour a little before from the hand of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovius.</hi>
When <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was to be girt with the Sword, and demanded what
Lady he would make choiſe of to be his Miſtris, he kneeled down, and beſeeched
the Fair <hi>Silviana</hi> to let him make choiſe of her, that he might make it his boaſt,
that he received his honours from the Faireſt Hand, and Faireſt Lady that lives.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Childerick</hi> was extreamly ſurprized at this requeſt, and was ready to break out
into ſome violent demonſtrations of his diſpleaſure, yet the preſence of the King his
Father reſtrained him, though not from bluſhing, and letting many ſee how much
this Act diſpleaſed him; and much more was he incenſed when he ſaw in what a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
manner this Fair Lady gave conſent unto the requeſt which <hi>Andrimartes</hi> made,
and expreſs her contentment by her eyes, and all her actions. But the joyes of this
young Knight was unimaginable, when thanking her for the favour which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he proteſted and vowed to imploy both his ſword and his life in her ſervice: And
ſhe, who never offered to hide the good will which ſhe bore unto him, knowing
that ere long he would ask the Queens conſent unto a marriage, prayed heartily unto
<hi>Heſus</hi> to make his Sword victorious, and ſaid, that ſhe would with all her heart do
any thing within the compaſs of her power, to teſtifie the great eſteem which ſhe
had of his merits. But Sir, ſaid ſhe, I neither will, nor can confer this favour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you without the Queens conſent, who has the diſpoſition of me. <hi>Andrimartes</hi>
thinking that ſhe ſpoke with much diſcretion, he kneeled down before <hi>Methina;</hi>
Madam, (ſaid he unto her) Is it your pleaſure I ſhould this day receive the greateſt
honour that ever I can pretend unto? <hi>Childerick</hi> tranſported at this beyond all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
interrupted him and ſaid; Me thinks <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that unleſs you were too
impudent, you would never offer to make this requeſt unto the Queen and <hi>Silviana,</hi>
until you had by ſome noble action made your ſelf worthy of it, <hi>Andrimartes</hi> who
knew very well what it was which made <hi>Childerick</hi> ſpeak ſo; Sir, ſaid he unto him,
I muſt needs confeſs that I do not deſerve this favour and honour; but yet I ask it
out of a deſire I have of doing you ſome ſervice: and I know that when once I am
honoured with the Title of <hi>Silvianas</hi> Knight, that glorious name will ſo invigorate
and encourage my ſpirits, as no enterpriſe can be ſo difficult, but I ſhall bring it
happily to paſs. This thought, anſwered the angry Prince, were good, if it were
not unjuſt: But it is not reaſonable you ſhould aſſume unto your ſelf a name which
cannot be merited but with blood. My blood, replied the young Cavalier preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſhall never be ſpared in ſuch a cauſe, no more then my life in the ſervice of the
King: But Sir, I find my ſelf much miſtaken in my hopes; for I thought that in
this, and upon all other occaſions, you would have been my Protector, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53527:131"/>
thered me all you could, as a Prince, unto whom I am devoted both by nature and
my own inclination. <hi>Childerick</hi> would have anſwered, and perhaps according to
the violence of his paſſion, if <hi>Merovius</hi> miſliking the action of his Son, had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed;
and to cover the imprudence of <hi>Childerick,</hi> ſaid thus, You had reaſon
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> to expect all favour from <hi>Childerick:</hi> I know that he intends it, and I do
command him unto it; what he ſaid was only by way of rallary, and both he and I
will become your Mediators unto the Queen, to conſent that <hi>Silviana</hi> may receive
you as her Knight; for it is but reaſon ſo Fair a Lady ſhould have ſo brave a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
for her Knight. The young man all tranſported with joy, offered to kiſs the
hands of <hi>Childerick</hi> and the King, and though the young Prince did permit him, yet
it was with ſuch a brow, as plainly ſhewed that he did it only out of reſpect unto the
King: and though <hi>Methina</hi> ſaw this as well as <hi>Merovius,</hi> yet ſhe commanded
<hi>Silviana</hi> to receive <hi>Andrimartes</hi> as her Knight, ſince the King did approve of it.
The young Lady never obeyed any command more willingly then this, and did it
with a face ſo full of contentment, as every one took ſpecial notice of it: This did
ſo ſting the heart of <hi>Childerick,</hi> that he reſolved, whatſoever came of it, to break off
this Love which went ſo much againſt his heart.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe he knew that he had too much diſcovered his paſſion, and that the
King was not well pleaſed with it, he conſtrained himſelf as much as poſſibly he
could, to make it believed that what he had done was only out of rallary, as <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
ſaid: but there was not one in all the company which did not know the contrary,
eſpecially <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> who knew very well that it proceeded from his affection
unto <hi>Silviana,</hi> and well did plainly foreſee many a ſtorm towards from him: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
come what come could, he reſolved to continue his Love; and becauſe that
Honourable Order of Knight-hood, which he had taken upon him, was an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon him to ſhake off the drowſie life of being always among women, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to quit that idle and effeminate kind of life, and to go into the Army as ſoon
as he had obtained <hi>Silvianas</hi> leave, and not to return until ſome ſignal act had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him meritorious of the Fair Lady. She who ſaw a kind of neceſſity upon him to
take this courſe, and thought that it would much conduce unto that contentment
which they both aimed at; ſhe conſented unto it, though with abundance of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to part with him: and knowing that it was the Kings cuſtom to incite all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
young Spirits unto gallant actions, and to recompence thoſe that by their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
did ſignalize themſelves in the Army; they did both of them overcome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and with a River of Tears parted, in hope that their abſence would bring
them to their deſired end, ſooner then their preſence.</p>
                     <p>To relate all the paſſages of this ſad parting, and the demonſtrations of good will
unto each other, is neither pertinent to the ſtory, nor indeed poſſible: let it ſuffice
therefore, that <hi>Silviana</hi> expreſſed her affection as far as her modeſty and honour
would permit, and <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> as became a perfect and noble minded Lover. But
I conceive it neceſſary to acquaint you with the ſequel of this deſign when he was in
the Army, though the day be not long enough to relate the hundred part of his
brave deportments; for he gave ſuch teſtimony of his courage and valour, that
<hi>Merovius</hi> made choiſe of him to command that relief which he ſent into <hi>Belgium,</hi>
againſt the children of King <hi>Clodion, Renald</hi> and <hi>Alberick;</hi> who being come at full
age, <hi>Alberick</hi> being Lord of <hi>Cambray</hi> and the bordering Countries, and <hi>Renald</hi>
Duke of <hi>Auſtraſia,</hi> and having married <hi>Huſemide,</hi> Daughter unto <hi>Multiades</hi>
King of Tongres, they contracted a league with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and with a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Army, fell into <hi>Auſtraſia,</hi> ſo as had not <hi>Merovius</hi> very prudently ſent this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
under the conduct of the valiant <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> certainly their Arms had reached
as far as the gates of <hi>Paris;</hi> and perhaps had not only retarded all the conqueſts of
this Valiant King, but alſo, had put his very Crown into great hazard. But the
Valour and Prudence of <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was ſuch, that giving a ſtop unto the progreſs
of theſe two brothers, he conſtrained them to keep within the confines of <hi>Auſtraſia,</hi>
until <hi>Merovius</hi> had quelled thoſe enemies which the Romans had ſecretly ſtirred
up againſt him: and this piece of ſervice was ſo great, that <hi>Merovius</hi> did highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
it; and thought no recompence ſufficient for ſuch ſervices as he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the brave <hi>Andrimartes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:53527:131"/>
It is a hard matter to expreſs the joys of <hi>Silviana,</hi> when ſhe heard of all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
exploits of her beloved <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> whoſe preſence ſhe did infinitely deſire,
that ſhe might rejoyce with him for his happy ſucceſs: and yet ſhe was well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his abſence, ſince ſhe her ſelf was a ſharer in his glory, and ſince it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
ſo much unto the advantage of the Crown of the <hi>Franks;</hi> ſhewing her ſelf
by her wiſe and virtuous moderation, to be the Grand-child of <hi>Semmon</hi> Duke of
<hi>Gaul Armorique,</hi> the faithful friend of King <hi>Merovius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was not a man who did not love, and highly commend the Valiant and Wiſe
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> (and for ſix years together which he continued in the Army, he met
not with one accident which did not end in happy ſucceſs) <hi>Childerick</hi> only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
who grudged at all his victories, though they were all to the advantage of that
Crown which he was to inherit after <hi>Merovius:</hi> but his love being above his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he diſliked all his actions, and detracted from his glory as much as poſſible
he could; knowing very well, that all theſe applaudes of him would kindle the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which <hi>Silviana</hi> bore unto him. But at length, <hi>Andrimartes</hi> not being able to
live any longer from his adored Lady, though he received Letters continually from
her, he obtained leave from the King to return unto <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſettle ſome affaires
which he pretended, did require his preſence. He preſented himſelf therefore unto
the Queen, who received him with all poſſible welcom; and he thought it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to ſtrike now whilſt the Iron was hot, and ſpeak unto the Queen concerning his
marriage: and in order-thereunto, he entreated a neer Coſen of his to make this
requeſt unto the Queen in his behalf. <hi>Methina</hi> who was well acquainted with the
merits of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and conſidered what ſignal ſervices he had done the King
her Husband, ſhe was very glad of any occaſion to give ſatisfaction unto his deſire;
and to teſtifie how ſhe approved of that marriage: Tell <hi>Andrimartes</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto
the party that was imployed to deliver the requeſt unto her) that I do not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto his deſire; but alſo <hi>Silviana</hi> being Grand-child unto <hi>Semnon</hi> our dear
friend, I promiſe him to procure his good will, and the Kings alſo: and in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of my forwardneſs to gratifie him all the wayes I am able, I do allow him
to live with her, not only as her ſervant, but alſo as him that is to be her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                     <p>This anſwer which was as favourable as <hi>Andrimartes</hi> could poſſibly hope for,
was received with ſo much joy, that it was impoſſible for him to keep it ſecret: ſo as
the news of it was preſently all over the Court and Army; and <hi>Methina</hi> having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>Merovius</hi> with it, it pleaſed him ſo well, that he ſpoke of it openly, and
ſaid, that he was obliged to acknowledg the ſervices of that brave Cavalier, in the
higheſt manner: ſo as to defer his ſatisfaction no longer, he preſently diſpatched a
Meſſenger to Duke <hi>Semnon</hi> his dear and ancient friend, to procure his conſent unto
this marriage, promiſing to advance <hi>Andrimartes</hi> unto ſuch a height, as he ſhould
never repent of beſtowing his Grand-child upon him.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Childerick</hi> hearing this news, firſt by the letters of the Queen his Mother, and
afterwards by the diſcourſe of <hi>Merovius</hi> his Father, he was ſo diſpleaſed at it, that
he could not chuſe but ſpeak of it unto him, under a pretence of doing him ſervice;
Sir, (ſaid he unto him, finding him alone) I do underſtand by the Queens let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and alſo by your diſcourſe this morning, that <hi>Andrimartes</hi> intends to marry
<hi>Silviana:</hi> now Sir, the ſervice which I ow unto you, commands me to hint unto
you a thing which I think worthy of your conſideration. And though I do not
doubt of your high prudence, yet your multitude of other great affairs, makes me
fear that you have not time to think upon things of lower importance. I muſt needs
confeſs Sir, that the ſervices of this Cavalier does deſerve a recompence, but not ſo
far as to make you commit a greater offence againſt <hi>Semnon</hi> your dear friend &amp; ally,
and alſo againſt your ſelf: for certainly recompenſes ought never to be made to the
diſ-advantage of our friends, or ſuch as truſt us with things that are moſt dear unto
them: <hi>Semnon</hi> Sir, you know, is Duke of <hi>Gaul Armorique;</hi> it was he who at your
firſt coming into this Country received you into his friendſhip; aſſiſted you with all
his ſtrength and counſel; and it may be ſaid, that he and <hi>Guyveline</hi> Governour of
the <hi>Edvois,</hi> were the two ſureſt Pillars, upon which you laid the foundation of
your Dominion. Is it therefore reaſonable Sir, that if he truſt you with his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53527:132"/>
who is to be the ſupport and comfort of his age, you ſhould diſpoſe of her
without his conſent? Or is it fit, to propound a match ſo unequal and ſo diſ-advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
unto him? Will you Sir, let it be ſaid that <hi>Merovius</hi> does recompence his
ſervants at the charges of his neighbour Princes and friends? Pardon me Sir, for
ſpeaking ſo boldly unto you; and if it be a crime, blame my natural deſire to cleer
your name from aſperſion, which I know is contrary to your intention, and al your
former actions: not but that I do think it reaſonable, and worthy of commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in you, to remunerate <hi>Andrimartes:</hi> But then Sir, I beſeech you, let it be out
of your own charges, and with ſomthing in which you have an intereſt; in ſo doing,
you will get the name of a Generous and Magnanimous Prince: you will then be
called the King of <hi>Hearts</hi> as well as of <hi>Franks;</hi> there are other matches in your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which <hi>Andrimartes</hi> himſelf cannot chuſe but think much more ſutable and fit
for him, then <hi>Silviana,</hi> whom if he pretend unto, in lieu of getting friends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himſelf by that unequal alliance, he will draw a mortal odium upon himſelf, and
have enemies that will never pardon that offence which he ſhall commit by your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation.
Thus without advantage to himſelf, he will cauſe you to loſe that credit
and amity, which you have gotten with ſo much paines, and which with ſo much
care and prudence you have hitherto preſerved with all that know you. Do not
think Sir, that I am the firſt Authour of theſe conſiderations, for many of your
beſt ſervants that dare not tell you as much, have addreſſed themſelves unto me,
thinking that great Princes who are full of high imployments, will not reflect upon
things of a lower ſphere, which though ſmall in themſelves, yet may draw after
them many dangerous conſequences: I believe if <hi>Andrimartes</hi> did but conſider of
what importance, or rather what prejudice this marriage will be unto your ſervice,
he would be the firſt (as deeply in love as he is) that would decline it; I am confident
he would not offer ſo much diſ-ſervice unto your Majeſty, as to diſcontent your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in cauſing you to loſe the amity of your Allies. So as Sir, if you will pleaſe to
command me, I will undertake to divert him from it, and uſe ſuch pregnant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and reaſons, as ſhall ſo convince him, that he ſhall think no more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Childerick</hi> found ſuch a patient hearing from his Father, that he hoped preſently
to obtain commiſſion for ſpeaking unto <hi>Andrimartes.</hi> But that wiſe King, having
long ſince obſerved how this young Prince was in Love with <hi>Silviana;</hi> and knowing
that all theſe inſtances proceeded only from his deſires of enjoying her himſelf, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him a full hearing, and ſeeing that he expected his anſwer, he aſſumed
a ſerious look, which teſtified the ſmal ſatisfaction which he received for his long
Oration, and gave him this anſwer.</p>
                     <p>I am very ſorry <hi>Childerick,</hi> to find in you ſuch humours as I leaſt deſire, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in two things, which believe it my Son, will become your ruine, if they be
not prudently corrected. The firſt is an effeminate inclination, which does bebauch
you unto a diſſolute kind of life, devoting your ſelf wholly unto pleaſures and love:
for if from contraries, contrary effects may be expected: How can I imagine but
that when I ſhall leave you this Crown, which was gotten by ſo many hazards and
toyl from the valiant Romans, you will as ſoon loſe it as it was gotten? Alas you
do degenerate from the martial vertue of your Nation the <hi>Franks.</hi> The other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
which I do extreamly condemn you for, is; The imploying your wit to cover
your vice with a vail of virtue. Do you think me <hi>Childerick</hi> ſo little vers'd in the
affairs of the world, that I do not ſee how all your ſpecious arguments are only to
hinder <hi>Silviana,</hi> whom you do love, from marrying? Do you think I have forgot
your Language which you uſed when <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was made a Knight? Can you
believe me ignorant of her throwing a Picture into the fire, which you had gotten
of hers, unknown unto her? Do you think I never heard how violently you kiſſed
her by force? Do not think <hi>Childerick</hi> that any of your actions towards her is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
unto me; and though hitherto I ſuffered them, and ſeemed to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
yet it was only in hopes that you would reclaim your ſelf from ſuch a manner
of life, as you could not chuſe but know would exceedingly diſpleaſe me. You take
upon you to be a very great States-man, and will needs teach me how much I am
obliged unto <hi>Semnon,</hi> hinting upon all the good offices he has done me: Pray
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53527:132"/>
                        <hi>Childerick,</hi> unto which of all my neighbours have you ſeen me deficient, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in paying my duty unto their amity and good will? Why ſhould you think me
ſo negligent of him whom I love and eſteem above all the <hi>Gaules?</hi> If you cannot
dive into the depth of my deſigns, why ſhould you not think thoſe things which paſs
your underſtanding to be done with as much reaſon, as thoſe things are which be
within the compaſs of your capacity? What have I done hitherto, which any of
my friends can upbraid me withall? Nay, can any of my enemies charge me with any
neglect of duty to them? And is <hi>Childerick</hi> the only one that can condemn the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Father? Good Son give me a reaſon for your cenſure: Nay, I believe
you have no reaſon; but becauſe I conſent to the marriage of a Lady, which out of
a fond affection you would diſhonour: do you think it better and more honourable
for <hi>Semnon,</hi> our generous and ancient friend to marry his Daughter unto you, then
unto <hi>Andrimartes?</hi> But <hi>Childerick,</hi> do you deſire to marry her? Can your fooliſh
humour hurry you unto ſuch a crime? I cannot believe it, and had rather you were
dead then ever ſee the day; or that you ſhould entertain ſuch a thought: not but
that I do highly eſteem the virtue of the Father, and like the Lady, for both are
very worthy of much honour: but I had rather reſtore back unto <hi>Reynald</hi> or his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Aberick,</hi> the Crown of their Father <hi>Clodion,</hi> then conſent that ſuch a puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimious
courage as yours ſhould have the Soveraign Power over ſuch a war-like peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as this which I command. Now if your drift be not to marry <hi>Silviana,</hi> what
would you do with her? Would you make her your whore? Do you think the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of my houſe can brook it? Will the reputation of the Queen your Mother ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it? Or the courage and generoſity of <hi>Semnon</hi> endure it? Fie, fie, <hi>Childerick,</hi> ſtifle
ſuch leud thoughts, and abominate them: let not ſuch a fond love blind your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
and then you will plainly ſee that if I do not conſent unto this marriage of
<hi>Silviana</hi> unto <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> I am infinitely to blame; for Princes as your ſelf ſays,
are obliged to recompence ſervices done, with benefits and honours: and if ſo, how
much am I obliged unto <hi>Andrimartes?</hi> Who, not to mention his other exploits
which he hath done for us, has not only repulſed the power of <hi>Clodions</hi> children,
but forced them to keep within the limits of <hi>Austraſia:</hi> he may be ſaid to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
all the reſt of our Dominions, by his valour and wiſe conduct, and repreſſing
the inſolency of our enemies, has given us the means to make new conqueſts. Now
tell me <hi>Childerick,</hi> how great is my obligation for ſuch ſignal ſervice? How juſtly
might I be branded with ingratitude, if I ſhould deny his affection, his fidelity, his
courage, and his merits, the firſt requeſt that he ſhall make unto me? But you bid
me pay my debts with my own mony, and not with <hi>Semnons,</hi> who keeps this
Daughter for the ſupport and comfort of his old age. Let me tell you Son, that
if I ſhould deny unto his Grand-child ſuch a ſutable and advantageous marriage, it
would be a great prejudice and injury to her aged Father; for there is no Prince,
nor King, though never ſo great; but would be glad of his alliance, who is able
not only to preſerve a ſtate, but by his valour and prudence is able to get a hundred
Kingdoms: What greater advantage or comfort can <hi>Semnon</hi> have in his old age,
then to ſee <hi>Silviana</hi> his Daughter in the hands of ſo brave and virtuous a Cavalier,
and his State under the guard of ſuch a valiant, prudent, and proſperous Captain as
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> is? Conſider <hi>Childerick,</hi> that I do ow this gratification unto <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes,</hi>
for his Excellent ſervices which he hath done; and I do ow it alſo unto
<hi>Semnon,</hi> for the friendſhip and fidelity which I have always found from him. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you your ſelf will acknowledg as much, and if you contradict me, it is not
<hi>Childerick</hi> which does it, but a fooliſh effeminate paſſion which will ruine him, and
which if he do not preſently correct, will make him loſe that Crown which now I
wear. If therefore you have any deſire to pleaſe me, leave off this drowſie kind of
life, which will render you the ſcorn and odium of all that know you, eſpecially of
the <hi>Franks,</hi> whoſe martial diſpoſitions will never love nor endure ſuch an effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
perſon to be their King. Alſo <hi>Childerick,</hi> I would have you leave off all your
tricks of diſſimulation, with which you would cloak your effeminate deſigns with a
vizard of virtue: otherwiſe, let me tell you Son, that though I am your Father by
name, yet I am not in affection, but will make it appear both unto you and all the
world, that I do not conſent unto ſuch a contemptible life, as you do live.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:53527:133"/>
                        <hi>Childerick</hi> was extreamly confounded at this anſwer which <hi>Merovius</hi> gave him,
for his own conſcience did convince him; yet according to the common cuſtom of
of all ſuch as would put a gloſs upon their faults, he offered to excuſe himſelf of part
of thoſe things wherewith his Father upbraided him, by denying the one abſolutely,
and ſo diſguiſing the other, that perhaps he had made his cauſe good, if he had had
to do with one leſs Judicious then <hi>Merovius.</hi> But the wiſe Father after he had
heard all his gilded excuſes, at laſt he interrupted him. I perceive <hi>Childerick</hi> (ſaid
he unto him) that you are very ſorry I have been ſo quick ſighted as to ſee your
faults: but you ought not to grieve for that; repent rather the committing them,
then my ſeeing them: for being your Father, I ſhall be as careful to conceal them
as your ſelf; but if you be wiſe, continue no longer in this courſe of life, which
will moſt ſhamefully become your ruine: and conſider that a Prince who is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
a people, ought to render himſelf more wiſe, and more virtuous, then the
people, which are to obey him; for otherwiſe his government will be only by Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which is leſs ſafe unto him, and more diſpleaſing unto them.</p>
                     <p>Upon this <hi>Merovius</hi> would hearken unto no reply, but leaving him, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
a meſſenger preſently unto the Queen <hi>Methina,</hi> which let her underſtand,
that without more delay, ſhe ſhould propound this marriage unto <hi>Semnon</hi> Duke of
<hi>Gaul Armorique,</hi> and to aſſure him, that he would raiſe <hi>Andrimartes</hi> unto ſuch
a degree, as he ſhould have no cauſe to repent the beſtowing his Grand-child upon
ſuch a brave Cavalier. The Queen who was as desirous to give <hi>Andrimartes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
as the King, ſhe diſpatched an Ambaſſador immediately unto <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
whoſe conſent was eaſily obtained; and who having heard ſo great a Fame
upon the Name of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> did embrace the motion, with many thanks unto
the Queen, for her deſires of ſuch a Match for <hi>Silviana:</hi> thinking himſelf ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
both unto her and <hi>Merovius</hi> for it, as he thought himſelf ſufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
for all the ſervices he had ever done them, and beſeeched them to diſpoſe of
him and his Grand-child as they pleaſed. Only this he deſired, that he might ſee
<hi>Andrimartes,</hi> to the end he might be better acquainted with him, who was to enjoy
<hi>Silviana</hi> and his eſtate.</p>
                     <p>This anſwer being received, the Queen did preſently acquaint her Husband with
it, who thought it expedient for <hi>Andrimartes</hi> to make this journey unto the good
Duke; and the rather, becauſe at that time he had either Peace or Truce with all his
Neighbours, and could beſt ſpare him. <hi>Andrimartes</hi> and <hi>Silviana,</hi> hearing of this
intended ſeparation, though they knew it conduced much unto their future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments,
yet their extream affections unto each other, could not conſent unto it
without abundance of grief; for whilſt he was in the Army, ſhe heard from him
every day: but now the journey was long, and they foreſaw that the good Duke
<hi>Semnon</hi> would not ſuffer him to return ſo ſoon as they deſired: yet neceſſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
them, <hi>Andrimartes</hi> departed, more deſirous to return, then to be the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor
of <hi>Gaul Armorique.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall not Madam, here relate the paſſages of his reception both by <hi>Semnon</hi> and
his people, who underſtanding the intentions of their Lord, did make preparations
to receive him with all manner of honour and joy; infinitely applauding the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their good Duke: Let it ſuffice to tell you, that after <hi>Semnon</hi> had welcomed
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> with all manner of magnificence, and kept him a while in his Court,
he did not only grant <hi>Silviana</hi> unto him, as he deſired; but alſo proclaimed him
his Succeſſor in <hi>Gaul Armorique,</hi> and cauſed all his vaſſals and ſubjects to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
him ſo: ſo as all the Grandees, all the Souldiers, and all the Knights, received
him as their ſucceeding Lord with great applauſe.</p>
                     <p>Preſently after this or a little before, <hi>Clidemant</hi> was come into the Army of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovius,</hi>
and ſaw <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> being a witneſs of his brave exploits: So as when this
news was divulged in the Court of <hi>Merovius,</hi> it was very welcom unto all the brave
Cavaliers, <hi>Childerick</hi> only excepted, who was much diſpleaſed at it: for though
he made a ſhew of the contrary, and ſince his Father had chid him, was not ſo
bold as to let his love unto <hi>Silviana</hi> appear, yet in lieu of diminiſhing, it encreaſed
every day: not that he had any intention to marry her, for he aymed at ſomething
higher; but his deſign was to enjoy her in another quality. When he heard any
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53527:133"/>
commend the choiſe which <hi>Semnon</hi> had made for his Grand-child, he could not
forbear ſpeaking very diſ-advantageouſly of it, and charge him, ſometimes with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
and ſometimes with indiſcretion: of injuſtice, in depriving his right Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
from his Eſtate; and of indiſcretion in ſubmitting <hi>Gaul Armorique</hi> unto a
<hi>Frank</hi> who was a ſtranger. So as not being able to quench his flaming paſſion, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
an opportunity of diſcourſe with <hi>Silviana,</hi> he ſaid thus unto her: Is it poſſible,
Fair Lady, you ſhould ever think of marrying <hi>Andrimartes?</hi> Sir, anſwered ſhe, is
he not a Cavalier of greater merit then I can deſerve? It ſeems, replied he, that you
are ignorant in matter of merit, ſince you do not ſee that the leaſt of your perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
does infinitely tranſcend all that is in <hi>Andrimartes.</hi> Sir, anſwered ſhe and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
If I be of ſuch worth as you ſeem to make me, I ſhall quickly make him rich;
for I will wholly beſtow myſelf upon him: and for my part, I ſhall think my ſelf
ſufficiently payed if he do but love me, and unto that I ſhall hope to oblige him, by
the extream affection which I do bear unto him. This ſpeaks your judgment to be
wonderous weak, ſaid <hi>Childerick,</hi> and that your will tranſports you beyond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Sir, anſwered ſhe, if you think to vex me by ſuch diſcourſe as this, you are
to blame, ſince my will was alwayes to honour you. And if it be to croſs <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes,</hi>
I ſhall wonder, ſince the only ambition of that poor Cavalier, is to imploy
his life for the propagation of your Crown. Fair one, anſwered the young Prince,
my deſign is neither to vexe you, nor croſs him; but only to prevent your ruine,
which I foreſee will be if you do not retire your ſelf from this young and indiſcreet
affection: believe it, I do not ſpeak without reaſon, and did you conſider what
good fortune is offered you, perhaps you would not thus precipitate your ſelf: Sir,
replied <hi>Silviana,</hi> ſet your heart at reſt, and believe this for a moſt certain truth,
that all the great advantages in the world, ſhall never divert my affection unto <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes:</hi>
The Queen and the King allow of it, <hi>Semnon</hi> approves of it alſo, and
what then can make me backward? Why good <hi>Silviana,</hi> replied <hi>Childerick,</hi> do
you make no reckoning of my will? And do you not think that my conſent is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary?
Certainly I do Sir, (anſwered ſhe) but I cannot think you will ever croſs
the will of <hi>Merovius.</hi> The Love which I do bear unto you is ſuch, (ſaid he) that
if I ſaw it would be neceſſary for your good, I would croſs even <hi>Tautates</hi> himſelf.
But ſince you care ſo little for your own good, adieu; and remember that I am
<hi>Childerick,</hi> a Kings Son, and one who hereafter will let you ſee what a fool you are to
deſpiſe that good will which he offers unto you. Upon this, not ſtaying for her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
he went away in an angry mood: At which ſhe was very ſorry, not in any
conſideration of her ſelf, but out of fear leſt his anger ſhould reflect upon her dear
<hi>Andrimartes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Semnon</hi> having kept <hi>Andrimartes</hi> a long while with him, and
thinking it now time for him to return unto <hi>Merovius,</hi> he diſmiſſed him, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that as ſoon as he was married he ſhould return and bring <hi>Silviana</hi> with him,
with a reſolution of ſtaying alwayes, and taking upon him the care of his Eſtate, and
ſpending the reſt of his dayes in reſt.</p>
                     <p>At his return every one received him with all imaginable honour, and careſſes.
<hi>Merovius</hi> who treated him already as Duke of <hi>Gaul Armorique,</hi> was very glad that
one of his own nation, and one over whom he had ſo much influence, ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſo great a People, and become his Neighbour; thinking it to be a great ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
unto his Crown: and in this conſideration he commanded <hi>Childerick</hi> to make
much of him, and to love him, not as his Vaſſal, but as his Neighbour, and one
who might give a great ſettlement unto his conqueſts. But all theſe careſſes were
nothing unto <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> in compariſon of that welcom which he received from
his deareſt <hi>Silviana,</hi> who now took him for her Husband, and lived in all honeſt
liberty with him; and though ſhe did not conceal any of her actions or thoughts
from him, yet ſhe would not acquaint him with the diſcourſe of <hi>Childerick,</hi> as well
becauſe ſhe knew that all he ſaid was falſe, as becauſe ſhe thought that it would
much diſcontent him: But ſhe reſolved to retire her ſelf with him as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſhe could, into the dominions of <hi>Semnon;</hi> and ſo avoid that Tiranny and thoſe
inſolencies, which ſhe expected from him when he ſhould be abſolute Lord of the
<hi>Franks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53527:134"/>
There being no ſtop in the accompliſhment of this ſo much deſired marriage, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thina</hi>
by the Kings authority, and by conſent of <hi>Semnon,</hi> cauſed the articles of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to be drawn; and about eight dayes after, the ceremonies were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
to the contentment of all, and with ſo much joy and ſatisfaction unto <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viana</hi>
and <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that never two Lovers were better contented. <hi>Childerick</hi>
only ſighed whilſt all other rejoyced.</p>
                     <p>But as if Heaven ſtayed only until this marriage was paſt, before all <hi>Gaul</hi> ſhould
become all ſorrows, within ſeven or eight dayes after, <hi>Merovius</hi> fell ſick, and
preſently after dyed, full of glory and honour, and infinitely bewailed by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Childerick</hi> was preſently ſet upon the Throne, and proclaimed King of the
<hi>Franks,</hi> in falſe hopes that he would be the Imitator of his Fathers virtues. <hi>Silviana</hi>
remembring the harſh language which ſhe had received from him, adviſed her dear
Husband to get out of the reach of this young King, and to retire into <hi>Gaul Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
as well to avoid the malignity of <hi>Childerick,</hi> as to keep his promiſe with
<hi>Semnon.</hi> But <hi>Andrimartes</hi> who was ignorant of the laſt language which he had
uſed unto <hi>Silviana,</hi> and who thought himſelf obliged to ſtay a while with this new
King, and ſee the Crown ſetled upon his head, he would not hearken unto the
counſel of <hi>Silviana,</hi> thinking it againſt his duty to retire before all was ſetled, and
ſo delayed the time under pretence of furniſhing himſelf with all things neceſſary for
their journey: in the mean time he was alwayes with the King, and ſo full of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and care in all his expreſſions, as any other but <hi>Childerick</hi> would have thought
himſelf obliged: But he on the contrary remembring the injuries which he thought
he had received, deferred the reſolution of his ſoul only till the Ceremonies of his
Coronation were paſt: In the mean time news was brought unto the Valiant <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes</hi>
and <hi>Silviana,</hi> that the good Duke <hi>Semnon</hi> was dead, and that all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
earneſtly deſired them to come into their dominions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvianas</hi> grief was very great, and that of <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was no leſs; for
having received ſo many benefits from that Prince, it grieved him extreamly,
that he ſhould die before he had done him any ſervice. But when their firſt tears
were almoſt dryed up, Heaven gave them cauſe for new ones, and more bitter then
the firſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Childerick</hi> now thinks all well enough, and his Crown faſt upon his head; and
he fell into ſuch a licentious courſe of life, as every one was out of hopes to find
his Fathers virtues in him. The People complained, the Grandees grumbled, and
his beſt lovers lamented him. After they had a while endured his ſhameful kind of
life, and ſuffered many Preſſures and Tyrannies obtruded upon the people, the
Grandees of the State aſſembled themſelves together at <hi>Province,</hi> and afterwards
at <hi>Beauvois;</hi> where after deep debate and ſerious conſideration, they reſolved to
declare him unworthy and incapable of the Crown of <hi>Franks;</hi> and at the ſame time
to make choiſe of one, who though a Roman, yet they thought to be a perſon of
great merit and worthy to be their King: his name was <hi>Gillon,</hi> who had long ſince
left the Roman Empire, and followed <hi>Merovius,</hi> unto whom he had done very
great and faithful ſervice, and had added unto the State of the <hi>Franks</hi> the Town of
<hi>Saiſſons,</hi> of which he was the Governor. But for my part, I believe, they made
choiſe of this ambitious man, becauſe there was not any <hi>Frank</hi> that would take the
Title and charge upon him, and maintain it againſt their natural and legal King:
For treaſon was a moſt deteſtable ſin amongſt them, and abhorred by all. But you
may ſee Madam, how when the great <hi>Tautates</hi> has a mind to chaſtiſe men for their

and arming himſelf, and all the Grandees confederating and plotting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Childerick</hi> drowned in a dull ſecurity, was moſt indiſcreetly contriving how
he ſhould get <hi>Silviana</hi> by force from <hi>Andrimartes;</hi> not by any deſign of marrying
her, for that he could not do, ſhe being married already, but to uſe her at his
pleaſure, as he had done ſome others, ſince the death of <hi>Merovius:</hi> This young
Prince was much induced unto theſe diſorders, by the poiſonous adviſe of ſome baſe
Flatterers about him, who cryed up, that all things were Lawful unto a King; that
Kings made Laws for their Subjects, not to tye up their own hands; and that ſince
the lives of his Vaſſals were in his power, he might do what he would with their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53527:134"/>
eſtates or any thing of theirs: Theſe flattering but falſe maximes, moved him to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
this injury unto <hi>Silviana,</hi> and the Valiant <hi>Andrimartes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Queen <hi>Methina</hi> retired her ſelf to <hi>Remois,</hi> becauſe ſhe would not be any
witneſs unto the diſhonourable and debauched actions of <hi>Childerick,</hi> and becauſe
ſhe deſired to comfort her ſelf after her great loſs, by the conſolations of one <hi>Remy,</hi>
a perſon who ſhined in all virtue, and one, who though the God whom he adored
was unknown unto the <hi>Franks</hi> and us, yet never any afflicted perſon parted from
him without much comfort. <hi>Childerick,</hi> taking the opportunity of his Mothers
abſence, he deſired no more but to make <hi>Andrimartes</hi> leave <hi>Silviana</hi> by her ſelf;
in order to which he took him aſide, and told him that he had matters of very great
importance to imploy him in, and ſuch as he would not commit unto the fidelity of
any one but himſelf: he told him that the buſineſs ſo neerly concerned his Crown,
and required ſuch extream haſte, that he hoped he would not deny him, but prepare
himſelf for a ſudden departure. <hi>Andrimartes</hi> who did not think the Son of <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
ſhould ever entertain any ſuch damnable thoughts, did freely anſwer him, that
he was ready to ſerve him in this occaſion or any other; and that though he loved
<hi>Silviana</hi> as his wife, yet he loved <hi>Childerick</hi> as his Soveraign: and to ſhew that
theſe two affections were not incompatible, he would teſtifie that he held nothing
more dear unto him then his ſervice. Upon this <hi>Childerick</hi> gave him ſome coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inſtructions, and gave him no longer time to prepare himſelf for his journey
then that night, and therefore <hi>Andrimartes</hi> acquainted his dear <hi>Silviana</hi> with his
imployment, and told her that he hoped to return within five or ſix dayes at the
furtheſt. The wiſe <hi>Silviana</hi> gave a patient hearing unto what <hi>Andrimartes</hi> told her,
and having a quick and apprehenſive wit, ſhe anſwered him with a deep ſigh, thus:
This journey, I am afraid, will not bring me any contentment, and I beſeech Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
I be deceived in my thoughts: <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> you may remember that <hi>Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
did once love me, or at the leaſt ſeemed ſo whilſt his Father lived; and he has
uſed very ſtrange expreſſions unto me, ſuch as I never did impart un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o you, but
ſuch as make it manifeſt that he ſlights all thoſe ſervices which you have done for him
and <hi>Merovius;</hi> and having all the power in his own hands, Heavens know how far
he will extend it: you ſee what kind of life he lives, and how apt he is to be hurried
unto any violent act; and therefore, what good can we ever hope for from him?
for my part I am extreamly afraid of the man; and he has two qualities which may
well make any to fear him; that is, a wicked will, and abſolute power: what imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
can he have for you that are good? Why ſhould he be ſo haſty in packing you
away? I beſeech Heaven, it be with a good deſign: upon this, ſhe took him about
the neck, and kiſſed him, but bathed her kiſſes in a flood of tears, which did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
move the heart of this Generous Cavalier unto compaſſion: then ſeriouſly
thinking upon the diſcourſe of <hi>Silviana,</hi> and finding much reaſon in it, he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her thus: Theſe teares, my deareſt, do infinitely ſwell my ſoul with ſorrows;
and I muſt confeſs, I find all your words ſo full of reaſon, that I wiſh ſome other
were imployed in my room: but ſince I have already taken it upon me, and have
his inſtructions in my keeping, what excuſe can I make to come off withal? And
how can I be quit of my imployment without an extream diſpleaſing him? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly be: but ſince I have gone thus far, I muſt go further, and do as well
as we can; and therefore, I will tell you what I think we ought to do: Firſt, I muſt
go, and return with all the haſte that poſſible I can make; in the mean time, go you
unto the houſe of <hi>Andrenick</hi> our old and truſty ſervant, yet unknown unto any:
If <hi>Childerick</hi> have any bad deſign, doubtleſs he will either come unto you, or ſend
for you; by this his intentions will be known unto us: if they prove good, I ſhall
be very glad that no more noiſe is made of our jealouſies of him: and if they be
bad, I ſhall give him but a very ſmal time to execute his deſign; for he ſhall not
live a day after my return: becauſe I will give his wicked ſoul a paſſage out of his
body in the midſt of all his guards and ſouldiers: but being yet in doubt of it, I
would not have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſaid, that ever <hi>Andrimartes</hi> committed ſuch an act upon a bare
jealouſie.</p>
                     <p>This was the reſolution of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> who ſetting forward in the morning very
early, acquainted the truſty <hi>Andrenick</hi> with his purpoſe concerning <hi>Silviana;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53527:135"/>
him to keep it ſecret from all the world. This <hi>Andrenick</hi> was an old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
who had the government of him in his youth, whoſe affection was ſo great,
and his fidelity ſo well known, as <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was as ſure of him as of himſelf.
His houſe was neer the houſe of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and he took it, becauſe he thought
that ere long his Maſter would go into <hi>Gaul Armorique,</hi> and he having a wife and
children could not go with him.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as ever <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was gone, <hi>Silviana</hi> without acquainting any of her
maids, went unto the houſe of <hi>Andrenick;</hi> and commanded them, that if any Ladies
came to viſit her, to ſay that ſhe was not well, and deſired to ſee no body. <hi>Silviana</hi>
in the interim, locked her ſelf up with the wife of <hi>Andrenick,</hi> trembling at every
noiſe which ſhe heard, and thinking that ſhe ſaw <hi>Childerick</hi> at her Chamber door.
It is very ſtrange to obſerve, what a blind knowledg we ſhall ſometimes have of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
that are to happen. <hi>Silviana</hi> indeed had reaſon to fear the exorbitant inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of <hi>Childerick;</hi> but yet ſince the death of <hi>Merovius,</hi> ſhe needed not have
any ſuch deep apprehenſions, ſince his inſolencies fell upon ſome others; ſo as ſhe
might well imagine his thoughts to be diverted from her, and carried another way:
but I cannot tell, ſome good Genius told her, that ſhe ſhould never ſee her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
again, and that ſome miſ-fortune would befal both him and her: this was the
reaſon of her fears, and ſtudy to prevent all manner of diſaſters; and becauſe ſhe
had a great confidence in the wife of <hi>Andrenick,</hi> ſhe acquainted her with her fears,
and they two plotted together what courſe was beſt to be taken. <hi>Silviana</hi> asked
her what they ſhould do, if <hi>Childerick</hi> not finding her at her own houſe, ſhould
look for her there. Firſt of all they ſought out for ſome private place where ſhe
might hide her ſelf; for it was impoſſible to reſiſt the power and force of the King:
but finding the houſe to be very little, and very inconvenient for ſuch a purpoſe,
there being no places of privacy in it, ſhe began to think upon having recourſe unto
death as her ultimate refuge: but the good woman loving her very well, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Andrimartes</hi> would never ſurvive her: No, no Madam, (ſaid ſhe) never
think upon any dying; but if you will follow my directions, I will ſecure you from
all manner of violence. You are young, and tall, you have a good leg, and no big
breſts; I would adviſe you to diſguiſe your ſelf in the habit of a Cavalier: I have here a
ſuit of Clothes which is newly made for one of my Sons, he never wore them, and
therefore none can know them; and I am confident that none who ſees you with a
Sword by your ſide, and a Feather in your hat, will ever take you for <hi>Silviana;</hi>
as for your hair, what if you did cut it, though not till we ſee an abſolute neceſſity of
it? in the mean time therefore, whilſt we have leiſure let us put you into this trim, for
however, there is no harm in it, whether you ſhall ſtand in need of it or no. Oh
Mother (cryed out <hi>Silviana</hi>) bleſſed for ever may ſhe be that bore you; for now
by your prudence I ſhall hope to preſerve my ſelf for my deareſt <hi>Andrimartes:</hi>
there is no better way under Heaven then this; dear Mother, let us make all the haſt
we can; for my heart tels me, that we ſhall be preſently put unto all our ſhifts:
and as for my hair, let the Sciſſers be in readineſſe, for I will not make any ſcruple
of it.</p>
                     <p>Upon this the virtuous <hi>Silviana</hi> began to undreſs her ſelf, whileſt the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
went to fetch the Suit of Clothes which ſhe ſpoke of; and becauſe ſhe deſired
to do her all the ſervice ſhe was able, ſhe returned again immediately, ſhe ſhut the
door faſt, ſhe helped to trick up <hi>Silviana,</hi> who appeared to be the braveſt Cavalier
in all the Court, and ſo diſguiſed her, that the good woman verily believed ſhe
would paſs unknown by any: the ſuit did fit her ſo well, and became her, that
when ſhe girded the Sword about her, now, ſaid ſhe, do I create you a Cavalier,
and under that name oblige you to defend the honour of Ladies. Mother, anſwered
<hi>Silviana,</hi> this Sword will defend the honour of one Lady at the leaſt, and having
it by my ſide, I fear not the violence of <hi>Childerick,</hi> but will make uſe of it againſt
him, or if he prove too ſtrong for me, againſt my ſelf, who as feeble as I am, have
courage enough to paſs into another world without any ſtain unto my honour: but
Mother, me thinks I want Boots and Spurs: for if this Tyrant do come hither, it
is not likely I ſhould ſtay here; and if I go away, to be in this habit and on foot, is
not handſom, but will rather render me more ſuſpitious: ſince you are ſo coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53527:135"/>
(ſaid the good woman) I do not fear your ſafety; as good luck is, there
are two horſes in the houſe, which I have heard <hi>Andrenick</hi> ſay, are very gentle and
fair conditioned; I will accompany you, and before I diſguiſe my ſelf, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them to be made ready: the Footman of <hi>Andrimartes</hi> ſhall hold them, and if
we ſtand in need of them, we will then mount them.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the good woman went down to take order about theſe Horſes, and Boots,
and Spurs, <hi>Silviana</hi> ſtayed alone in the Chamber, ſo glad of her diſguiſe, that ſhe
knew not how to be thankful enough unto Heaven for this happy occaſion of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the deſignes of <hi>Childerick:</hi> for remembring his laſt language unto her, ſhe
verily believed that he had ſent <hi>Andrimartes</hi> away, only to have more opportunity of
offering ſome violence unto her; this memory filled her full of chill fears: I know,
ſaid ſhe in her ſelf, that the Tyrant intends violence unto me, and becauſe he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the courage of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> has packed him away with a deſign of getting him
to be killed at his return. As ſhe was in theſe thoughts, the wife of <hi>Andrenick</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
unto her, to whom with a trembling voice and tears in her eyes, ſhe ſaid thus;
Oh Mother! I am but a dead woman unleſs you help me; for this wicked man,
knows very well that the courage of <hi>Andrimartes</hi> will never endure the injury which
he thinks to do unto me, without revenge, and therefore for certain, he will cauſe
him to be murdered at his return, if we do not ſome way or other prevent it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
(anſwered ſhe) let me dreſs my ſelf as ſoon as I can, that I may follow you;
for me thinks I hear ſome noiſe in the ſtreets: what you ſay Madam is not without
ſome probability, for a Tyrant never acts his villany by halfs: She had no ſooner
dreſſed her ſelf, but a meſſenger brought them word that the King had been at the
houſe of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that he ſought for <hi>Silviana,</hi> and menaced <hi>Andrenick,</hi> and
the reſt of the Domeſtiques, to know where ſhe was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silviana</hi> now did cut her hair, and the hair of <hi>Andrenicks</hi> wife, and then went
all three to the horſes, and ſo opportunely, that they were no ſooner out of the houſe,
but <hi>Childerick</hi> with all his guard entred in at another door; making ſuch a noiſe,
that the poor Ladies trembled out of fear of falling into their hands: but the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who had been in ſeveral dangers with his Maſter in the wars, he was not at all
affrighted: follow me, ſaid he, and fear not, for I ſwear by the life of my Maſter,
that I will kill him who ſhall offer any injury unto his wife. Thus haſting them away,
becauſe the noiſe encreaſed, he got them over the bridg; and mending their pace,
he carried them towards the Mount of <hi>Mars,</hi> and in a cloſe valley under the
Mountain, they did hide themſelves, intending when it was night to go unto ſome
Town, a little farther off. But the wife of <hi>Andrenick,</hi> who was in great fear of
her Husband, and <hi>Silviana</hi> being very deſirous to know what <hi>Childerick</hi> did when
he found her not; they commanded him to go into the Town, and hear what news:
the Footman went, &amp; as luck was, came into the Town juſt as they were ready to ſhut
up the gates, leaving theſe two Ladies ſo aſtoniſhed to ſee themſelves in ſuch a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
place ſo diſguiſed, as they could not chuſe but be in great perplexity. But <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianas</hi>
great affection unto <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> when ſhe conſidered the danger he was in
at his return, made her deſire to be going towards him; and certainly had ſhe
known the way, ſhe would not have ſtayed for the return of the Footman: but advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with the good woman upon the beſt courſe, it was judged dangerous to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without a guide; and therefore, comforting themſelves as well as they could,
they ſtayed until Heaven ſhewed them a better courſe. Expecting therefore the
return of the Footman with much impatience, and time beginning to ſeem very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
unto them, at the laſt they ſpied him coming, and running as faſt as he could;
and becauſe they perceived that none could ſee them, they went to meet him, being
extreamly deſirous to know what news he brought.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as he came unto them, he wanted breath to ſpeak; Madam, ſaid he, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Silviana,</hi> the Heavens have helped you beyond all expreſſions; and you could
never have taken a better courſe, then thus diſguiſing your ſelf and getting away:
for Madam, that ungrateful <hi>Childerick</hi> (for he deſerves not the name of a King)
that wicked man, that Tyrant, has committed more ſtrange inſolencies and violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in your houſe, and in the houſe of <hi>Andrenick,</hi> then any Barbarian would ever
have offered in the ſacking and plundering of an enemies Town: Oh Friend, (ſaid
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53527:136"/>
                        <hi>Silviana</hi>) prethee tell us the whole ſtory of his actions, Madam, (ſaid the wife of
<hi>Andrenick</hi> and interrupted her) firſt let him tell me how my husband does. Your
Husband (anſwered the man) is well, and was joyed beyond all meaſure when I
told him what courſe you had taken; but becauſe this place is too neer the Town, I
think it beſt Madam to get us further from it, and by the way I will make a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
unto you. Good Friend (ſaid <hi>Silviana</hi>) conduct us towards the place where
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> is, for I am reſolved to go unto him, and tell him my ſelf what has
hapned.</p>
                     <p>The man then directed them the way which his Maſter told him he would come
when he returned; and becauſe it grew late, and <hi>Silviana</hi> was not uſed to travel
in that manner, they reſolved to go no further that night then <hi>Clay:</hi> the man
therefore placed himſelf betwixt them, and began to ſpeak thus unto his Miſtris by
the way.</p>
                     <p>Madam, ſaid he unto her, Though it is but a while ſince you left your houſe, yet
ſuch and ſo many ſtrange accidents have ſince hapned, that I know not where I
ſhould firſt begin the relation of them. Happy you are that <hi>Tautares</hi> inſpired you
with ſuch feares of <hi>Childerick;</hi> and it is no leſs then a miracle that you have eſcaped
his inhumane hands: for he came unto your houſe in a more inſolent manner then
ever was heard of. Be pleaſed to know Madam, that when I came to the gates of
the Town, I wondred to find them half ſhut, ſo as had I ſtayed but a minute lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
I could not poſſibly have entred: all the Town was up in Arms; and in ſuch a
tumult, that every ſtreet was chained, and all doors ſhut. With much ado I got
unto your houſe, which I found full of people and ſouldiers ready to fall together
by the ears; in the mean time, I heard many cryes and much lamentation made,
ſome ſaid that <hi>Silviana</hi> was there, that <hi>Childerick</hi> would raviſh her; and to have a
better opportunity for it, had ſent away <hi>Andrimartes</hi> unto the good Queen <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thina:</hi>
many did grumble at it, and ſaid, it was a ſhame for the people of <hi>Paris</hi> to
ſuffer ſuch a piece of violence before their faces: that if they endured this, they
ſhould encourage a Tyrant to commit the like actions; that now, neither their
Wives, nor their Daughters, were in ſafety, ſince all was at the will of a luxurious
Prince, and that they had much better die once, then live alwayes in ſuch igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny
and ſlavery. I obſerved that amongſt thoſe who uſed ſuch plain language,
there was both <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Franks:</hi> and I perceived that a very little ſpurring on,
would move them unto Arms. To the <hi>Franks</hi> therefore I ſaid thus; Oh Sirs, can
you endure to ſee <hi>Andrimartes</hi> thus unworthily uſed before your faces? And unto
the <hi>Gaules</hi> I ſaid; Oh Friends, muſt the virtuous Daughter of the good Duke <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
be thus raviſhed in your Town, and find no relief amongſt you? There needed
no more to ſet them together by the ears, and with ſuch furie, that of the Tyrants
guard and ſouldiers ſome were killed, others put to flight, and all in ſuch diſorder,
that he himſelf had much ado to get into his Palace, to which the people flocked,
and God knows what they did further. As for me, I ran preſently unto your houſe,
where I found <hi>Andrenick,</hi> without either hat or cloak, and pitifully abuſed by the
followers of <hi>Childerick;</hi> yet he received not a wound: but all the houſe was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and all the women with their hair about their ears, and never was greater
violence and diſorder offered unto any houſe. As ſoon as ever <hi>Andrenick</hi> and thoſe
women ſaw me, they all cryed out for joy, and asked me where you were; unto
whom I anſwered, that you were in a place where your greateſt ſorrow was for
them and their injuries: and taking <hi>Andrenick</hi> aſide, I told him what you had
done, and where you were; at which he was ſo tranſported with joy, that he fell
down upon his knees and held up his hands to Heaven; Bleſſed for ever be the great
<hi>Tantates,</hi> ſaid he, for directing you how to foreſee and prevent ſo great a mis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
then riſing up, he asked me of all circumſtances; whether his wife was with
you, and what ſhift you made to eſcape: and having ſatisfied him in all his queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as briefly as poſſibly I could, I left him the moſt contented man in the world;
but when he ſaw me ready to depart, he commanded me to tell his wife, that ſhe
ſhould rather die then forſake you. And becauſe I feared leſt you ſhould think
the time long, I made all the haſte that poſſibly I could to return unto you, but with
much ado, for I found every ſtreet chained up, and it was long before I could get
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53527:136"/>
a paſs: but at laſt, ſeeing the people ſo much incenſed, and hearing them all ſpeak
very advantageouſly of my Lord, I told them openly that I belonged unto <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes,</hi>
and that you had ſent me unto him to acquaint him with the violence that
<hi>Childerick</hi> had offered unto you. I cannot expreſs Madam, how affectionately they
all offered themſelves to aſſiſt me when they heard this; I found my paſſage very
eaſie after this, and every one offered me any favour and courteſie I could deſire:
ſo as when I came to the gates, they were preſently opened unto me, and when I
was out, he who kept the guard, call'd me, and ſaid; good friend, bid thy maſter
make all the haſte he can, and tell him, that we are all ready to venture our lives for
him, in revenge of this injury which is offered. Thus the man ended his relation;
and in the mean time <hi>Silviana</hi> went on as faſt as ſhe could out of her extream deſires
of meeting <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that ſhe might acquaint him with this accident, and move
him to take that revenge which the people promiſed.</p>
                     <p>Be pleaſed to know Madam, that as ſoon as <hi>Childerick</hi> was ſure that <hi>Andrimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
was gone, he aſſembled a company of young Ruffians, which uſed to prompt
him unto ſuch violences, and went unto the houſe of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> where finding
none but the faithful <hi>Andrenick,</hi> and thinking that he had hid the Fair <hi>Silviana,</hi> or
at leaſt knew where ſhe was, he ſeiſed upon his perſon, and offered him a thouſand
injuries; ſo as but for <hi>Clidemant</hi> and <hi>Lindamore,</hi> he had put him to death. But they
hearing that the people aſſembled themſelves tumultuouſly together, they Armed
themſelves, and ran into the throng of the tumult; and well it was for the King they
did ſo, for elſe he had found the danger of an incenſed people, who upon great
reaſon had Armed themſelves. But <hi>Clidemant</hi> ſeeing <hi>Childerick</hi> in this danger, he
drew his Sword, and diſ-engaged the King from amongſt them, though <hi>Clidemant</hi>
and <hi>Lindamore</hi> alſo were much wounded, yet not ſo dangerouſly, but they accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the King into his Palace: unto which all the <hi>Seguſians</hi> preſently flocked, and
amongſt them <hi>Guyemant,</hi> who though he was known to be the ſervant of <hi>Childerick,</hi>
yet was not hated by the people, becauſe every one knew that he was none of that
debauched number, which prompted the King unto theſe unworthy and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
courſes. When <hi>Lindamore</hi> ſpied him, Oh <hi>Guyemant,</hi> (ſaid he unto him) muſt
<hi>Clidemant</hi> do pennance for a fault which he never committed?</p>
                     <p>Heavens forbid, (anſwered <hi>Guyemant</hi> and was much troubled) I hope ſo great
a miſ-fortune will not befall us: Then going neerer unto <hi>Clidemant,</hi> he kneeled down
by his bed-ſide, and taking him by the hand, Sir, ſaid he unto him, let your courage
make it appear, that you are able to overcome a greater mis-fortune then this. Dear
friend (anſwered <hi>Clidemant</hi>) I do not want courage, but yet I am not able to reſiſt
the power of death. <hi>Guyemant</hi> with tears in his eyes, then ſaid unto him, I hope
that <hi>Tautates</hi> will not afflict us ſo much, as to raviſh from us a Prince ſo neceſſary
for the happineſs of men, but will let us enjoy him longer to our happineſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
<hi>Guyemant,</hi> anſwered he, we are all in the hands of the great <hi>Tautates;</hi> he
may diſpoſe of us as he pleaſeth: and for my part, ſo he will be pleaſed to let me
leave this life, with that good reputation which my <hi>Ancestors</hi> did leave unto me, I
ſhall be well contented and ſatisfied with the time that I have already lived. Then
calling <hi>Lindamore</hi> unto him, who was wounded, though not ſo mortally as he, and
who was all in tears to ſee his Lord in this extremity: You two (ſaid he unto <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damore</hi>
and <hi>Guyemant</hi>) are the perſons in whom I have greateſt confidence; <hi>Guye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>
I conjure you to tell <hi>Childerick,</hi> that I do die his ſervant, and am very ſorry
that I have given no greater teſtimony of my affection: yet tell him, that if the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
which I have done unto the King his Father, have any influence upon him; I
hope he will not take it ill if you tell him from me, that if he do not leave this ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
life, which he hath lived ſince he was King, he muſt expect a puniſhment from
Heaven. And you <hi>Lindamore,</hi> as ſoon as I am dead, or at leaſt, as ſoon as your
wounds will permit you, carry back all the <hi>Seguſian</hi> Cavalry into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
reſtore them back from me unto the Nymph my Mother, unto whoſe ſervice,
I conjure you, to continue faithful as you have begun: deſire her not to grieve for
the loſs of me, ſince it is the will of Heaven to have it ſo; and deſire her to comfort
her ſelf with this, that I have imployed the time which I lived, in the way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and die without reproach. Alſo tell my dear Siſter, that if any thing make me
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53527:137"/>
unwilling to die ſo ſoon, it is my deſires of ſeeing her, more then any thing elſe;
then cauſing us all to be called for, and ſeeing moſt of us ſtanding by his beds-ſide,
with tears in our eyes, he ſtretched out his hand unto us, and commanded us to
obey <hi>Lindamore</hi> as himſelf; but above all to ſerve you Madam, and the Nymph
<hi>Galathea,</hi> with all the fidelity of true Cavaliers, aſſuring us that we ſhould receive
from you a full recompence for all the ſervices which we had done unto him.</p>
                     <p>He would have ſaid ſomething more, but his Spirits fail'd him, and he dyed in
the arms of <hi>Lindamore;</hi> who ſeeing this, for grief fell into a ſwoon. I cannot expreſs
our ſorrows, nor the ſorrows of all the Court, when they heard of his death: the
very people of the Town, who commonly are very dull in ſuch reſentments, did
lament him, and alſo applaud him to the Heavens, ſaying; that the death of this
Prince was a great loſs unto their Nation and Crown; they were ſure he never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
unto the Violent Extravagancies, and Tyranny of <hi>Childerick,</hi> and doubtleſs
our condolements had been much more, but for the imminent peril and danger which
preſently after did threaten us; the fear of our lives forced us to ſtand upon our guard:
And at the ſame time, as fortune was, all the Lords and Grandees which were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
at <hi>Province,</hi> not knowing of this accident, came all to feel the pulſe of the
people; and finding them to beat after their own tempers, and with Arms in their
hands, they put it into the peoples heads to go and clamor at the Palace Royal, with
abundance of Drums and Trumpets; which making a great noiſe, <hi>Childerick</hi> began
to fear the fury of theſe mutinies. And becauſe he had a great confidence in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of <hi>Lindamore,</hi> and in the advice of <hi>Guyemant,</hi> he ſent for them both to adviſe
about his ſafety: neither of them both would in this juncture of danger upbraid him
with his faults; but both offered him their aid and aſſiſtance to the hazard of their
lives. <hi>Lindamore</hi> though wounded, adviſed to fall preſently upon the enemy, and
counſelled the King to die like a King, and a man of courage. But <hi>Guyemant,</hi> like
a wiſe and prudent Counſellor adviſed the contrary: Sir, ſaid he, let us not too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately
precipitate our ſelves, till there be no hopes of ſafety; though we were near a
thouſand men, yet we were nothing to the number of the enemy: time is the maſter
of occaſions, and may unexpectedly fit us with them: it is wiſdom therefore to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto time, and ſail with the wind; nothing is now to be done but to uſe our beſt
endeavours for the changing the mind of this tumultuous people, ſince we ſee all
the Grandees both of <hi>Gaul</hi> and of the <hi>Franks</hi> are joyned with them; it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> and all his Friends will alſo comply, for he is already ſent unto:
<hi>Gillon</hi> the Roman likewiſe with all his adherents will doubtleſs be ſtirring; and who
knows whether <hi>Renauld</hi> and his Brother the Sons of <hi>Clodion,</hi> will not be fiſhing
in theſe troubled waters? And therefore what good can we ever hope to do by
force? I adviſe therefore, and Sir if you will follow my Counſell, I will engage
my life to reſtore you unto the Crown of your Father: I adviſe you, I ſay, to
yeild unto the violence of this averſe piece of Fortune; retire your ſelf out of
this Kingdom, and reſt quiet with <hi>Baſin,</hi> in <hi>Thuring;</hi> he is your Kinſman and
your Friend, he will be glad to have you in his houſe, and ready to aſſiſt a
great affied Prince: In the mean time I call the Gods to witneſs, that when
you are abſent, I will imploy my whole intereſt and endeavours to reconcile
you unto the People, and I make no doubt but to effect it, if you will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the advice which I ſhall give.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Guyemant</hi> had no ſooner done ſpeaking, but they heard a Trumpet, which being
come neerer the draw Bridge, ſounded thrice, and afterwards they heard theſe
words uttered in a loud voice:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53527:137"/>
                        <q>The Druides, the Princes, and all the Cavalry of the Franks
and Gaules, aſſembled and united, do declare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
GILLON King of the Franks; and Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
a Tyrant, and incapable of wearing the Crown of
his Father.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Childerick</hi> and <hi>Guyemant</hi> upon this looked out of the window into the ſtreet, and
they ſaw <hi>Gillon</hi> carried, according to the cuſtom, upon the peoples ſhoulders, with
ſuch loud acclamations of the people, that <hi>Childerick</hi> ſaw <hi>Guyemant</hi> told him truly,
and therefore fearing leſt his own ſervants ſhould betray him, he retired himſelf
with the faithful <hi>Guyemant,</hi> and after ſome ſhort diſcourſe together, he parted from
him; carrying with him one half of a piece of gold, for a token, that when <hi>Guye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>
ſent him the other half, he might return into his Kingdom in ſafety: the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of this piece being joyned together, was on one ſide a <hi>Tower,</hi> to expreſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy;
and on the other a <hi>Dolphin</hi> amidſt the Surging Waves, with this Motto
about, <hi>Deſtiny does not Croſs any:</hi> Then changing his habit, he entreated <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damore,</hi>
though he was wounded, to accompany him with his <hi>Seguſian</hi> Cavalry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he was out of the hands of this tumultuous people; <hi>Lindamore</hi> conſented; and
<hi>Guyemant</hi> promiſed to give an honourable funeral unto the Prince <hi>Clidemant.</hi>
Night being come, the King got ſecretly out of the gates, and was conducted by
us Cavaliers as far as <hi>Thuring,</hi> and becauſe <hi>Lindamores</hi> wounds would not give him
leave to travel, he was forted to ſtay upon his return in the Town of <hi>Rhemois,</hi> where
the Queen <hi>Methina</hi> had a particular care of him and his cure.</p>
                     <p>There we heard how the Generous <hi>Andrimartes</hi> having met with the Fair <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viana,</hi>
preſently reſolved upon revenge; but hearing the ſame day how <hi>Childerick</hi>
was puniſhed, he thought it beſt to retire into his own dominions, and pardon the
fault of <hi>Childerick,</hi> which he did in ſome ſort excuſe, conſidering the ſuperlative
beauty of <hi>Silviana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lindamore</hi> on the other ſide, thought it expedient to acquaint you Madam with
the news, which though it be extreamly ſad, yet fearing the neglect of it might be
diſ-ſervice unto you, I did undertake his commands, and became the meſſenger.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Cavalier ended with his eyes full of tears; but <hi>Galathea</hi> hearing of her
Brothers death, although ſhe conſtrained her ſelf as much as poſſibly ſhe could, yet
ſhe fell into ſuch a flood of tears, that ſhe did ſufficiently pay the tribute of human
imbecility, and ſhewed her good nature. Her Mother gave her time to diſcharge
her ſelf of her juſt grief, and in the mean time asked the Cavalier whether <hi>Lindamore</hi>
intended to return ere it was long: and he anſwering, that he ſtayed only for his
recovery, ſhe took <hi>Adamas</hi> aſide, and commanded the Cavalier to withdraw, until
ſhe ſent for him again, but gave him a moſt ſtrict charge, to acquaint none living
with the death of <hi>Clidemant,</hi> nor of any accidents that had hapned unto <hi>Lindamore,</hi>
or King <hi>Childerick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Cavalier was gone, and none within compaſs of hearing but <hi>Galathea,</hi>
ſhe turned towards the <hi>Druide</hi> and ſaid unto him: You hear Father this ſad news,
and I muſt tell you that the loſs of my Son goes very neer my heart; nights can beſt
teſtifie my tears: but the neceſſity of affairs forces me to diſſemble my ſorrows in
the day; and Daughter it is very requiſite you do the ſame, for if the death of <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demant</hi>
ſhould come to be known before we have put our affairs into good order, I
am afraid <hi>Polemas</hi> ſhould take advantage of the abſence of all our Cavalry, and plot
ſome treaſon againſt us. I ſpeak-not this without ſome ground of reaſon, for I have
obſerved of late, that this man aſſumes more authority to himſelf then he ought; he
has made two attempts already upon the life of <hi>Damon,</hi> even in your preſence, and
this becauſe he feares I have no fancy to marry you unto him. But that which moſt
diſcovers his bad intentions, is the letters which <hi>Gondebaut</hi> King of the <hi>Burgundians</hi>
did write unto him, which I have ſeen, and which intimate a very cloſe correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
betwixt them; Theſe things being thus cloſely hid from me, muſt needs be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53527:138"/>
unto my diſadvantage; and I believe his deſign is to attempt againſt the State, and
to eſtabliſh his uſurpation by raviſhing <hi>Galathea</hi> from me, and marrying her either
by good will or by force.</p>
                     <p>Oh Heavens Madam, cryed out <hi>Galathea;</hi> do you think this pernicious man has
any ſuch abominable deſign? It is not to be doubted Madam, anſwered the <hi>Druide,</hi>
and I ground my opinion upon his procuring that Impoſtor to place himſelf ſo neer
the Gardens of <hi>Mount Briſon,</hi> to deceive you under a colour of Sanctity, and of
being a <hi>Druide,</hi> and to try if by this means he could obtain your favour; but ſeeing
that this failed him, and that <hi>Clidemant, Lindamore,</hi> and all the Cavalry are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
he may very well take hold of this opportunity, and make uſe of his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents
to that purpoſe, ſince the whole government of the Country is in his
hands; therefore, I humbly conceive Madam, (ſaid he unto <hi>Amaſis</hi>) that your
beſt courſe is to haſten <hi>Lindamore's</hi> return as ſoon as poſſibly he can, and that he
bring with him al his Cavalry; in the mean time, retire your ſelf into the City of
<hi>Marſelles,</hi> where without any noiſe, I will ſend unto you as many Souldiers and
Cavaliers as I can: within two dayes I will come thither my ſelf, and if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bring <hi>Damon</hi> with me, for I do not think the Country ſafe enough againſt the
violence of <hi>Polemas.</hi> I do vow (ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi>) that if this wicked man do offer
any attemps upon my perſon, I will with my own hands and nails ſtrangle my ſelf-Daughter,
(anſwered <hi>Amaſis</hi>) good Angels preſerve you from any ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
I had rather ſee you in your Coffin, then under the ſubjection of this inſolent
man; but I hope never to ſee it: and yet it concerns us to uſe that remedy which
<hi>Adamas</hi> out of his prudence and fidelity, hath propounded unto us; this very night
you ſhall go with me unto <hi>Marſelles,</hi> we will carry <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and all
their Company with us, and entreat them to leave off that habit which ſuits ſo ill
with their qualities; to morrow, I will ſend a letter for <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Madonthe:</hi>
But Father (ſaid ſhe and turned towards <hi>Adamas</hi>) as for the <hi>Druide,</hi> who was
formerly at <hi>Mount Briſon,</hi> who told Fortunes, and lived with ſo much appearance
of Sanctity, you muſt know that he is returned again, and begins to live, and do as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
he did: Oh Madam, anſwered <hi>Adamas,</hi> he is a moſt abominable Impoſtor,
and did you but know how <hi>Polemas</hi> makes uſe of him, you would think them both
worthy of puniſhment: but the diſcourſe of it will be too long for this time, for I ſee
the Sun grow very low, and you have no more time then to return unto <hi>Marſelles</hi>
by day light; but if we could ſeiſe upon this Impoſtor, perhaps we ſhould diſcover
by him what the deſign of <hi>Polemas</hi> is, for he is one of his great inſtruments. <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
whoſe very ſpleen againſt this man had almoſt dryed up her tears, if you pleaſe
(ſaid ſhe) we ſhall eaſily take him; for there needs no more but to pretend that I
deſire to ſpeak with him: but I do not know how to manage the matter handſomly,
without the aſſiſtance of <hi>Leonide,</hi> and therefore it is requiſite to ſend for her. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
your ſelf Madam, anſwered <hi>Adamas,</hi> that to morrow I will ſend her unto you;
and yet I think it a good way to ſend <hi>Silvia</hi> to morrow very early unto this Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
to tell him that you Madam have a very great deſire to ſee him, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this two or three dayes you intend to come unto him; this will alſo deceive <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
and perhaps may cauſe him to retard his wicked deſign, which will be very
advantageous unto us: for we ſhall have more time to provide for our defence,
which I foreſee we ſhall ſtand in need of. This being reſolved upon, <hi>Amaſis</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more delay, and to give <hi>Galathea</hi> time to dry her eyes, ſhe called for Pen, Ink,
and Paper, to write unto <hi>Lindamore,</hi> that he ſhould in all poſſible haſte come unto
her, and that he ſhould underſtand the great neceſſity of his preſence by the bearer:
which done, ſhe called for the Cavalier, gave him the Letter, and commanded him
not to loſe one minute of time, but poſt unto <hi>Lindamore</hi> withal poſſible ſpeed, and
tell him that ſhe ſhould ſee his good affection by the haſte that he will make in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her, and bringing with him all his Cavalry and Souldiers: And becauſe the
Cavalier was very truſty, and <hi>Lindamore,</hi> had great confidence in him, ſhe acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with the wicked intentions of <hi>Polemas,</hi> purpoſely to make him more quick
in his imployment, and to bring back <hi>Lindamore</hi> the ſooner. The Cavalier without
more delay took his leave; and <hi>Galathea</hi> to oblige <hi>Lindamore</hi> to make the more haſte,
Good Sir, ſaid ſhe unto him, tell <hi>Lindamore</hi> that I ſhall know whether or no he be
my friend, by the haſte that he ſhall make.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:53527:138"/>
Upon this the Cavalier departed, and the Nymphs with <hi>Adamas</hi> went out, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little common diſcourſe, they entreated <hi>Daphnide</hi> and her Company to go
along with them, and paſs away ſome dayes in <hi>Marſelles. Daphnide</hi> caſting her eye
upon <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and ſeeing that he referred it unto her, ſhe thought it not civil to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Nymph, and therefore ſaid ſhe would wait upon her: for which <hi>Amaſis</hi> gave
them thanks; and taking <hi>Daphnide</hi> by the hand, ſhe went unto <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Madon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the.
Damon,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him, I intend to ſend my letter for you to morrow, and
I deſire that for the reaſons which <hi>Adamas</hi> will give you, you will put your ſelf to a
little more paines in coming unto <hi>Marſelles.</hi> Madam, anſwered <hi>Damon,</hi> I have
both ſtrength and devotion to ſerve you in whatſoever you pleaſe to command.
After this, night compelled the Nymph to depart with all this good company; and
ſhe was ſo careful to ſend for <hi>Damon</hi> in the morning, that before ten of the clock,
he was at <hi>Marſelles</hi> with <hi>Madonthe, Adamas,</hi> and <hi>Leonide.</hi> But <hi>Paris</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
deſirous of going unto <hi>Belinde,</hi> he entreated <hi>Adamas</hi> he would be pleaſed
to write the letter which he had promiſed: <hi>Adamas</hi> being alſo very willing to give
him all ſatisfaction, did write according to his deſires: upon this, he departed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
ſo glad of <hi>Dianas</hi> permiſſion, and <hi>Adamas</hi> his conſent, as he could not
tell how to wiſh for more happineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adamas</hi> in ſatisfaction unto <hi>Galatheas</hi> deſire, ſent the ſame night for <hi>Leonide,</hi> to
the end ſhe might be with her the next morning betimes. And ſince ſhe was to go
unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> he writ unto her that <hi>Alexis</hi> ſhould not upon any terms go with her,
leſt ſhe ſhould be known; and therefore ſhe ſhould provide her ſelf with ſome hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
excuſe, and that this ſeparation would not be for above two or three dayes at
the moſt. When <hi>Leonide</hi> received this letter it was almoſt night, and as it chanced,
<hi>Astrea</hi> had carried them unto <hi>Dianas</hi> houſe: ſo as whilſt <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was talking with
<hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Daphnis, Leonide</hi> ſhewed <hi>Alexis</hi> the letter which ſhe had received. At
the firſt, ſhe was a little troubled at it, thinking it very odd ſhe ſhould ſtay alone in
a place, where if ſhe ſhould come to be known, it would turn to her diſgrace. But
on the other ſide conſidering, that if ſhe went unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſhe ſhould be utterly
ruined, ſhe was contented to ſtay ſtill in that place, pretending that ſhe was not yet
well, and telling <hi>Aſtrea</hi> in private, that ſhe was ſo much in Love with this retired
kind of life, as ſhe had no mind of going unto <hi>Galathea</hi> who had ſent for her; and
that ſhe would fain her ſelf ſick, purpoſely to ſtay with her in a place that was free
from the turbulent noiſe of a Court. Thus <hi>Leonide,</hi> got up betimes the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and left <hi>Phillis</hi> in bed with <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> and taking her leave of them, ſhe promiſed
to return very ſhortly to ſee them and <hi>Alexis;</hi> then going unto this diſguiſed <hi>Druide</hi>
who was not yet up: be ſure (ſaid ſhe unto her in her ear) that you manage your
time handſomly, and let not good opportunities ſlip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> anſwered her only
with a ſigh, and then <hi>Leonide</hi> went unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> and afterwards with him unto
<hi>Galathea,</hi> leaving the diſguiſed <hi>Druide</hi> in abundance of content, and more might
have had, if ſhe had had but confidence enough to make uſe of that fair occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Although <hi>Galathea</hi> out of a violent fit of jealouſie had baniſhed the Nymph <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
from her preſence, yet ſhe did after wiſh for her again, as well of her own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
goodneſs, when ſhe remembred the affection and fidelity of that Lady; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
her paſſion being now a little cooled, her judgment reaſſumed its ſtrength,
and ſuffered her to think her not ſo culpable, as in the heat of her anger ſhe thought
her: moreover the help of <hi>Silvia</hi> did not a little help her to diſcharge <hi>Leonide</hi> of
<hi>Celadons</hi> eſcape, when they talked together. But that which moſt made her forget
all her anger againſt this Nymph, was the death of <hi>Clidemant,</hi> and the enterpriſe of
<hi>Polemas,</hi> who had ſome deſigns both againſt her perſon and eſtate. And becauſe
great paſſions have a quality which drown all inferiors, and makes the ſoul think
upon nothing but it, this Nymph was ſo extreamly offended againſt the boldneſs
and treaſon of <hi>Polemas,</hi> that her mind did run wholly how ſhe ſhould chaſtiſe him:
ſhewing by this, that a generous Spirit can hardly brook any unworthy violence.</p>
                     <p>And obſerve how Heaven does laugh at the ſubtilties of men, and how eaſily it
can confute all human policy, and turn it to their own diſ-advantage: All the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
which <hi>Polemas</hi> had uſed to ruine <hi>Lindamore</hi> in <hi>Galatheas</hi> affection, being once
diſcovered, it made her Love him more; and the raſh enterpriſe upon which he laid
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53527:139"/>
the foundation of his future Grandeur, did revive in her thoſe ſparks which were
almoſt quite extinguiſhed by the ſubtilties of <hi>Polemas</hi> and <hi>Climanthes. Lindamore</hi>
being abſent, could not ſo ſoon be a witneſs of thoſe favours which this renewed
Love prepared for him: and <hi>Galathea</hi> longed for one unto whom ſhe might freely
diſcharge her heart of ſuch thoughts as were neceſſary to be concealed; when ſhe
looked upon thoſe that were about her, ſhe found none capable of the ſecret: as
for <hi>Silvia</hi> and her Nurſe, who knew moſt of her ſecrets, ſhe thought the one too
young, and the other too old; and though ſhe was confident of both their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and fidelities, and though the prudence and wiſedom of <hi>Silvia</hi> was above her
age, yet ſhe thought that matters of State were things of too great a weight to truſt
them withall: and upon this reaſon ſeeking for a good occaſion to recal <hi>Leonide,</hi>
and conſidering that ſhe never had any good ground to ſuſpect either her affection
or fidelity, unleſs it was in the buſineſs of <hi>Celadon,</hi> which being now out of mind,
and new accidents coming in lieu of it, they blotted out the memory of the other.
So as this new buſineſs coming upon her, and ſo neerly concerning her, ſhe accuſed
her ſelf of too much raſhneſs in baniſhing <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſhe intended to let ſlip no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of calling her back, and treating her better for the future.</p>
                     <p>And in as much as it is natural to deſire the concealment of our faults, <hi>Galathea</hi>
deſiring not to be taxed with levity and inconſideration in the baniſhment of <hi>Leonide</hi>
from her, ſhe did with abundance of care ſeek out for a good occaſion of calling
her back, without giving any knowledg of the cauſe why ſhe did baniſh her: ſo as
when it was ſaid that <hi>Climanthes</hi> was returned, and when ſhe heard that <hi>Amaſis</hi>
and <hi>Adamas</hi> deſired to know whether it was the Impoſtor who had formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them, ſhe ſaid that <hi>Leonide</hi> knew him better then any other, though ſhe
knew well enough that <hi>Silvia</hi> knew him as well as ſhe; and not to let ſlip this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
ſhe deſired <hi>Adamas</hi> to bring her back preſently: <hi>Leonide</hi> on the other ſide,
when her Uncle acquainted her with <hi>Galatheas</hi> will, ſhe was willing to obey her, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t
ſhe ſhould ſeem too much diſcontented: but with a reſolution of returning unto the
pleaſant banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> as ſoon as poſſibly ſhe could, as well to avoid the confuſed
life of the Court, as to enjoy the ſweet liberty in which ſhe lived amongſt thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and Fair Shepherdeſſes: and though ſhe did not tell her ſelf as much, yet the
true reaſon of her deſires to return, was to ſee <hi>Celadon,</hi> whom ſhe left diſguiſed
under the habit and name of <hi>Alexis:</hi> for though ſhe had endeavoured as much as
poſſibly ſhe could to quench that flame in her ſelf, yet ſhe found how hard a matter
it is for a ſoul to reaſſume its former liberty, after it is once captivated with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
love; and ſhe could not free her ſelf from that paſſion, though ſhe knew
that <hi>Celadon</hi> would never leave <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> confuting hereby the opinion of thoſe who
affirm, that there is no love without ſome hope.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Leonide</hi> came unto the houſe of her Uncle <hi>Adamas,</hi> though it was very
early, yet ſhe found all ready to depart: for the <hi>Druide</hi> knowing that important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
requires all haſte, and that it is haſte which gives them both life and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he had taken order for every thing requiſite by the break of day; both for
<hi>Damon</hi> and for <hi>Madonthe: Amaſis</hi> had ſent a good guard of Souldiers to be their
convoy, under a pretence of an honour unto them, and not as if ſhe feared any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
would be offered unto them by the way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvia,</hi> and moſt of her Companions, who knew of <hi>Leonides</hi> return, went and
waited for her at the outmoſt gate of the Caſtle, and did expreſs ſo many ſigns of
good will, as made it moſt evident that they loved her, at the leaſt, if any true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
can be found in a Court. <hi>Silvia</hi> above all the reſt, embraced and kiſſed her a
hundred times: and as ſoon as ſhe had ſaluted <hi>Amaſis,</hi> who received her very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and had kiſſed the hands of <hi>Galathea,</hi> who welcomed her with extraordinary
careſſes, they ſeparated themſelves as ſoon as they could from the reſt of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and related unto each other all paſſages which had hapned ſince their
laſt being together. <hi>Leonide</hi> with a calm temper related how pleaſingly ſhe had ſpent
the time of her baniſhment, in the company of thoſe fair and diſcreet Shepherdeſſes,
and told even wonders of their beauty, virtue, courteſie, civility, and wit, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis:</hi> but in this, more ſubtile then her companion,
ſhe ſpoke not a ſillable of <hi>Celadon,</hi> thinking it no diſcretion to truſt a young woman
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53527:139"/>
with a thing which once known, might bring her much diſpleaſure: and when <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
asked her concerning <hi>Alexis,</hi> as thinking her to be the daughter of <hi>Adamas,</hi>
ſhe anſwered very coldly and careleſly, and ſaid, that indeed ſhe was a very good
harmleſs body, and had a wit ſutable unto the profeſſion, in which ſhe had been
educated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Madonthe</hi> were in the interim received with all honour that <hi>Amaſis</hi>
and <hi>Galathea</hi> could do them, as well in duty to their merit, as to oblige <hi>Damon</hi> to
aſſiſt them in the urgent affairs which they foreſaw. When he was got into bed,
and the Chirurgions looked upon his wounds, though the ſhaking in the litter had
a little altered them, yet they thought that in a very few days he would be perfectly
whole: for though his wounds were great, yet they were not dangerous; and his
meeting with <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and finding her as affectionate unto him as he could deſire,
conduced much to his cure; and therefore every one conceived that the Chirurgery
unto the body, was to begin with the cure of the heart and mind. <hi>Madonthe</hi> on her
ſide, finding how much good her kindneſs did unto him, ſhe was almoſt continually
with him, ſhewing unto him all manner of civil favours: and foreſeeing that ſhe
was to ſtay long in that place in expectation of <hi>Damon</hi> cure, ſhe reſolved to change
her habit and become a Nymph; ſhe knew that <hi>Damon</hi> would be better pleaſed with
it, as more ſutable to her quality: and her new dreſs did ſo well become her, as ſhe
appeared to be a great beauty, which manifeſts, that beauty receives no ſmall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from trimming up it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Night being come, and <hi>Galathea</hi> having commanded <hi>Leonide</hi> to lie in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
when ſhe ſaw that all the reſt were retired, ſhe called unto her; and cauſing
her to take a candle, as if ſhe had ſome ſervice for her: then looking a long while
upon her without ſpeaking a word: at the laſt with a ſmiling eye ſhe ſaid unto her,
well <hi>Leonide,</hi> are you ſtill angry with me? With you Madam (anſwered <hi>Leonide</hi>
and made a low courteſie) why, I beſeech you, do you ask that queſtion? Do you
think me to be out of my wits? I moſt humbly beſeech you to believe that <hi>Leonide</hi>
will never fail in that honour and reſpect which I ow unto you. But Madam (ſaid
ſhe, and ſmiled) may I aſſume ſo much boldneſs as to ask you the very ſame queſtion
which you do me? Yes <hi>Leonide,</hi> anſwered <hi>Galathea,</hi> and let us here make a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and ſo rip up the whole matter, that we never after have any occaſion to
jarr: the truth is, you was angry with me, and I with you; and for my part I will
confeſs it proceeded from jealouſie: but <hi>Leonide</hi> why were you angry? If you will
needs have it ſo that I was angry, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> it did proceed from the ſame
jealouſie: How? replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> were you jealous of me? No Madam, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Leonide,</hi> but if I was angry, it was to ſee you jealous, and that you ſhould ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
me of a crime, whereof I was not guilty. Then <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſaid the Nymph, I
would have all things to be forgotten, and if I was too raſh, excuſe my error; for
truly I had an opinion that all which the <hi>Druide</hi> told me, was as certain as if it had
come from the mouth of an Oracle: Oh Madam, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> that <hi>Druide</hi> was
a moſt vile Impoſtor, and had you been pleaſed to have believed me, his villany
ſhould never have deceived you. Alas, anſwered <hi>Galathea,</hi> I was ſo deceived by
his language, as I was extreamly offended with all thoſe that ſpoke unto me againſt
him. But Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> do you know the truth now? Oh Sweet-heart,
anſwered <hi>Galathea,</hi> I have ſince found him to my coſt, a very knave: I am moſt
heartily glad of it, replied the Nymph, for then you will find my innocency. Speak
no more concerning your ſelf, replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> for I have quite altered my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and believe, that if I could have met with an opportunity, I ſhould have called
you back unto me before now; but I would not upon any terms that the cauſe of our
difference ſhould be known; yet I proteſt unto you <hi>Leonide,</hi> I never wiſhed you
any ill; it is true, I was angry with you, upon the ground that I have told you, but
for all that, I loved you better then any that are in my ſervice: and I think it may
be excuſed for being angry, for <hi>Leonide</hi> confeſs the truth, did not you help <hi>Celadon</hi>
to eſcape? And were not you to blame for oppoſing my will? Confeſs it freely
<hi>Leonide,</hi> for now, I care not for him, and will pardon you. Madam, anſwered
<hi>Leonide</hi> and ſmiled, I ſee you deſire I ſhould confeſſe a fault which I never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and ſince you have no more intereſt in him, I will freely confeſs, and proteſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53527:140"/>
that I did nothing but change <hi>Celadon</hi> into <hi>Lucinda,</hi> and you your ſelf did approve
of what I did, when I dreſſed him in the habit of a woman. But why ſhould I be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of packing him from you? And what intereſt had I in it? If you had no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> why did you ſo often importune me to let him return unto
<hi>Aſtrea?</hi> Many reaſons, anſwered <hi>Leonide</hi> did induce me thereunto: Firſt, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
leſt that a man ſhould be ſeen amongſt us, and what a blemiſh would it have
been to your reputation, if it had been known? Next, the ingratitude and ſcorn of
that Shepherd did extreamly diſpleaſe me: I thought him unworthy of that honour
which you did him, and which he did ſo ill acknowledg: but my chief reaſon of all
was, becauſe I was ſure you was deceived, and that the treaſon was invented by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas</hi>
and <hi>Climanthes,</hi> thoſe two unworthy wretches: and how came you to know
there villany? ſaid <hi>Galathea.</hi> Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> I told you then, but paſſion
kept you from believing me: when <hi>Celadon</hi> was ſick, you ſent me unto <hi>Adamas;</hi>
and by fortune coming into an Inn, I was lodged in a chamber, next unto that where
<hi>Polemas</hi> and <hi>Climanthes</hi> were all alone, and when they leaſt dreamed of it, I heard
all their villany. Ah <hi>Leonide,</hi> replied the Nymph, I will remember that you told me
as much, but time only could teach me how to believe you. <hi>Amaſis,</hi> my Mother
was deceived in him as well as I, and would never ſuffer him to be puniſhed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his merit: but nothing is ſo cloſe which time does not diſcover, my Mother
hath ſince found out his knavery; for all that he ſaid in relation to <hi>Clidemant,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
abſolutely falſe; ſo as now, ſhe hates him as much as either you or I can. I am
very glad, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> that the knavery of this wicked man is known, and more
glad to ſee you convinced of that error which he infuſed into you, and ſhould be as
glad to ſee him puniſhed for an example, and in terror of all ſuch Impoſtors. Never
fear it, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> for I believe that ere long we ſhall be ſufficiently revenged;
you muſt know, that he is of late returned again, and therefore I much deſired your
return alſo. How Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> is that Impoſtor returned again? It is as I
tell you, replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> and it is to be believed that he has ſome grand deſign in
hand, for he is the great Counſellor of that Traitor <hi>Polemas.</hi> Oh Heavens Madam,
ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> how infinitely you joy me to hear you ſpeak thus of thoſe two wicked
men; but, if I may be ſo bold as to ask, I beſeech you what have they done of late?
They have done ſuch things, anſwered the Nymph, that when you hear them, you,
will admire and abhor them both: they are plotting no leſs then the ruine of us and
all the Country: I do love you, Sweet-heart better then I did before, for in your
abſence I have found your diſcretion and affection to me; I will therefore truſt you
with a thing that none but <hi>Amaſis, Adamas,</hi> and my ſelf does know: then after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pauſe, ſhe began thus.</p>
                     <p>You know <hi>Leonide,</hi> that when this impudent villain was firſt at <hi>Savignea,</hi> my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as well as we, went to know of him the event of that voyage which <hi>Clidemant</hi>
my dear brother was to undertake. This Impoſtor amongſt many other things told
her, that after he had gotten much honour and glory, he ſhould return ſafely and
with much contentment unto all: But on the contrary, we have received news from
<hi>Lindamore,</hi> that poor <hi>Clidemant</hi> is dead, and himſelf ſo wounded, as he is forced to
ſtay with the Queen <hi>Methina</hi> in the City of <hi>Rhemois.</hi> Oh Heavens Madam, (cryed
our <hi>Leonide</hi>) is <hi>Clidemant</hi> dead? Speak low, anſwered <hi>Galathea,</hi> leſt any ſhould hear
us: for it concerns us to keep it cloſe for a while, unleſs we would fall into the moſt
baſe Tyranny that is imaginable. I beſeech you Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> what does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
you unto ſuch feares? And from whom do you expect ſuch inſolence? From
him (anſwered the Nymph) who did before plot how to deceive me, I mean <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas:</hi>
you muſt know that this arrogant wretch out of an incredible preſumption,
does not only plot how to marry me, as you heard from his own mouth, and from
<hi>Climanthes,</hi> but more, he intends to marry me though againſt my will: and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to that, he hath plotted moſt damnable treaſon both againſt me and the State,
ayming to make himſelf maſter of us both at once; you heard of his actions againſt
<hi>Damon,</hi> and we do underſtand what great intelligence he holds with <hi>Gondebaut,</hi>
King of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> without acquainting us: certainly his treaſon had broken
out before now, were he not in fear of <hi>Clidemant;</hi> nothing elſe reſtrains him: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſis</hi>
hath therefore ſent for <hi>Lindamore</hi> to return with all poſſible haſte; and though I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53527:140"/>
aſſure my ſelf he will not fail, yet being ſo far off, we are full of many fears. We
ſee how <hi>Polemas</hi> has all the Souldiers at his devotion, and my Mother thinking ſhe
had done very well in it, has conferred upon him ſuch ample power, as he has the
means to oblige them all to be at his own beck, though againſt us. I aſſure you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> in a great amazement, you have reaſon to ſay, that theſe are things
of great importance; ſo great, as I believe, nothing can more neerly concern you.
Now Sweet-heart, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> this Traytor who is yet ignorant of <hi>Clidemants</hi>
death, hath cauſed him whom you call <hi>Climanthes,</hi> to come unto the ſame place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
where he was before: for my part, I believe, it is to try if by ſome other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
he can win upon my will to marry <hi>Polemas:</hi> and <hi>Adamas</hi> whom I believe you
acquainted with the knavery of this Impoſtor, hath beſeeched <hi>Amaſis,</hi> to know
whether it be he or no, and if he prove the deceiver, to cauſe him to be ſeized upon;
for it is probable that by him we ſhall know of all <hi>Polemas</hi> his plots: and ſince he
truſted him with his deſign upon me, he would not hide the reſt of his deſign from
him. We were in the houſe of <hi>Adamas</hi> when this courſe was reſolved upon; and I
had an extream deſire to have you with me, I ſaid that there was none who could
manage this matter better then your ſelf, who had ſo often talked with him. In the
mean time, we came hither, and do all that we can for our own ſafeties: but we are ſo
unprovided of all manner of defence, as we know not which way to turn our ſelves.
This, Sweet-heart, is the ſtate of our affairs, which when well conſidered is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable;
for we have loſt <hi>Clidemant:</hi> all our beſt ſubjects are either dead with him,
or out of the Country; and we are almoſt in the hands of an inſolent fellow, whoſe
impudent ambition threatens us with intollerable ſervitude.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, the Nymph could not withhold her tears, nor <hi>Leonide</hi> neither, who
after ſhe had emptied her eyes and recollected her ſelf, did anſwer thus: I muſt needs
confeſs Madam, that of all treaſons this is the worſt, which being grounded upon
great ingratitude, it is to be hoped, Heaven will never let it arrive at the end of this
wicked mans deſires. The Gods are more juſt then to favour him in ſuch unjuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
and you ſhall ſee they will ſend us help in our neceſſity from ſuch means as
perhaps we leaſt expected. Put all your confidence Madam, in God, and aſſure
your ſelf, that he will not fail you; beſides, your cauſe is ſuch, that though there
was none but women to defend this place, I believe we are enough to keep it againſt
all men alive: and for my part, I believe, that upon ſuch an occaſion I ſhould be
more valiant then <hi>Lindamore:</hi> but Madam, ſince you ſent for me, as thinking I
might be uſefull unto you in the buſineſs, what ſervice is it you are pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me? I would have you go, (ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi>) and ſee whether this man be the
Impoſtor or no: if he be the ſame <hi>Climanthes,</hi> as I believe he is, I would have you
make him believe, that I have an extream deſire to confer with him upon a buſineſs
of great concernment; and if it be poſſible, perſwade him to come hither, and ſpeak
with me here: if you can prevail ſo far, we ſhall keep him ſo as he ſhall not go out
when he will; if you cannot, becauſe guilty perſons are always ſuſpitious of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
appoint a day when I may be ſure to find him there, for as you know, he
uſeth to hide himſelf ſome dayes: and if we ſhould go unto him with a ſtrong hand,
and he not be there, this would divulge our deſign ſo much, as we ſhould loſe the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of ever catching him.</p>
                     <p>After much other ſuch diſcourſe as this, <hi>Galathea</hi> diſmiſſed <hi>Leonide</hi> unto her reſt;
but calling her preſently back again. I muſt needs know (ſaid ſhe unto her) what
character you give of your Fair Shepherdeſſes, &amp; how you have lived all this while of
your abſence from me. Madam, anſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> I can ſay nothing of them but that
they are the faireſt, the moſt diſcreet and lovely women that ever I ſaw, and their
converſation is ſuch, that whoſoever is weary of their company, is certainly of a
very ill humour: the golden age Madam, which men lived in long ſince, and which is
ſo much envied by all that lived after them, could never enjoy ſo much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and pleaſure as is to be found amongſt them. I profeſs <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi>
you give them ſuch a character, as makes me wiſh my ſelf a Shepherdeſs. Certainly
Madam, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> did you but once taſte thoſe ſweets, and tranquility which
they enjoy, you would not deſire to leave them. And yet, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> they alſo
have their diſtempers and cares, and inquietudes; for when they loſt <hi>Celadon,</hi> did
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53527:141"/>
they not exceedingly reſent the loſs? It is impoſſible, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> to be in the
world, and be exempt from paying the tributes of humanity: but I call them happy
and free from inquietude, when I compare our cares and theirs together: I know
not why you ſhould think theirs ſo little, replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> for I have heard ſay that
when <hi>Celadon</hi> was loſt, not only <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but all the Town made great lamentations.
Truly Madam, anſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> they had ſhewed themſelves very inſenſible if the
loſs of ſo well an accompliſhed Shepherd had not moved them: I aſſure my ſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Galathea</hi> very ſubtilely, that as the loſs of him did fill them with ſorrow, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of him was as joyful unto them. <hi>Leonide</hi> knew the reaſon why the Nymph
ſpoke thus, and therefore ſhe anſwered her very coldly, doubtleſs, when they do
recover him, it will be abundance of joy unto them all; for that Shepherd was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
beloved of all that knew him: why (ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi>) is not <hi>Celadon</hi> yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
unto them? No Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> and now they hardly ſo much as think
upon him. Does not <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſometimes ſpeak of him? She does,
anſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> but never unleſs ſome other begin the diſcourſe. Why (ſaid the
Nymph) does ſhe not love him ſtill? Or has ſome other ſucceeded him in her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
Did ſhe love him, anſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſhe would love in vain, for every one
thinks him dead. I aſſure you, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that if he were dead I ſhould exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lament him; for he was the fineſt Shepherd of all his Country; and I muſt tell
you truly, the knavery of <hi>Climanthes</hi> did firſt move me to cheriſh him, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
his own merits moved me much more: and ſay what you will, I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
but <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> what face ſoever ſhe ſet upon it, will have him in her heart, as long
as ſhe lives; for I who am leſs concerned then ſhe, I cannot think upon him without
much diſpleaſure. But, added ſhe, it is late, retire your ſelf therefore; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you go to morrow with your companion <hi>Silvia,</hi> to ſee whether yond man be
<hi>Climanthes,</hi> or ſome other like him, for the buſineſs does not a little concern us.</p>
                     <p>This was the firſt diſcourſe which <hi>Galathea</hi> had with <hi>Leonide</hi> in private, of which
ſhe was very glad; yet ſhe perceived that <hi>Galathea</hi> was not ſo well cured of <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
as ſhe made a ſhew of; and therefore ſhe reſolved not to diſcover or diſcourſe
any thing of that Shepherd, which might bring him into memory, knowing very
well, that a Candle newly extinguiſhed, will light it ſelf again even by the very ſmoak.
But becauſe ſhe would not fail in thoſe commands which ſhe had laid upon her, being
of ſuch great concernment, after ſhe had conferred with her Uncle <hi>Adamas,</hi> ſhe went
with her companion <hi>Silvia</hi> to make this diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>When they came firſt to the place, they made a doubt whether it was <hi>Climanthes</hi>
or no; for they found every thing ſo changed, as they hardly thought it to be the
ſame place which formerly it was. Now was the place trimmed up very fine and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then before, with windows to give more light. This alteration did at the firſt
aſtoniſh them; yet ſeeing the door ſhut, they reſolved to knock and be better reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
They went up eight or ten ſteps higher unto the Temple then it was before:
and when they were at the top, through the windows which were on either ſide the
door, they ſaw an Altar at the other end of the Temple, and before it, a man at
his prayers, but they could not know him, becauſe his back was towards them. The
Cell being but little, they could hear what he prayed, ſo it is; Oh moſt Puiſſant
Deity, (ſaid he) I beſeech thee for a ſign from Heaven; and having repeated
the ſame words thrice over in a loud voice, they ſaw the fire kindle upon the Altar
of it ſelf, as readily as it was wont to do at other times, which made the two Nymphs
believe him to be the ſame Impoſtor whom they looked for: and they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
for he having ſpied them afar off, he prepared himſelf into this diſguiſe of
Sanctity: but they ſeeming not to have the leaſt ſuſpition of his Artifice, they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
unto one another words of great admiration, in an audible voice; which he
hearing, did much rejoyce at it, believing that they did not ſuſpect his knavery; and
the more to delude them by his new jugling, he turned his head towards them at the
noiſe which they made: and becauſe they deſired to enter into the Temple and ſpeak
with him, he took ſome Holy Water and waſhed his eyes and his eares, becauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> he
had both ſeen and heard theſe Nymphs whilſt he was at his devotion; then throwing
ſome Veruin, and a few leaves of Oak and Miſleto into the fire, he elevated his voice
and ſaid: If it be thy pleaſure, Oh moſt omnipotent Deity, that they ſhall enter into
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53527:141"/>
thy Sacred Temple, then open thou the doors and let them in. He had no ſooner
uttered theſe words, but the doors opened of themſelves, though none touched
them, which made the two Nymphs to wonder ſo much, that though they knew the
fellow to be but a jugling knave, yet they could not chuſe but be afraid; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſtood a while as if they doubted whether they ſhould enter or no; until he
himſelf in his Sacerdotal robes, and with a face full of gravity, came to invite them,
ſince it ſeemed to be the will of God they ſhould, by this particular ſign of favour
unto them. <hi>Leonide</hi> and her companion being grown a little more confident, and
ſeeming to bear a great reverence unto him, they entred, and followed him as far as
the Altar, where kneeling down after the example of this Impoſtor, they remained
in that poſture until he roſe up, and ſaid unto them; <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Silvia,</hi> the Deity of
the place whom I adore, is pleaſed with your coming into this Holy Temple; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
advertiſed me of your coming, and commanded me to let you enter without puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
you either by perfumes or holy water, I could not chuſe but be aſtoniſhed at it;
and therefore I asked of him an extraordinary ſign of his will; upon which, the fire
did preſently kindle of it ſelf. Then when you were come, I not being able to think
that you ſhould enter in this manner, I beſeeched him to ſhew his pleaſure by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the doors of the Temple unto you, which he moſt miraculouſly did, as you
have ſeen. Now, Oh moſt Omnipent and infinite Deity, if it be thy pleaſure, (ſaid
he and turned towards the Altar) that theſe Nymphs ſhould adore thee in thy Sacred
Cell, as it ſeems it is, by opening the dore unto them, ſhew us ſome ſign of thy
divine will, that thou art pleaſed they ſhould make their ſupplications unto thee:
When he uttered theſe words, the fire that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> upon the Altar did extinguiſh, and
the doors did miraculouſly ſhut of themſelves; at which the Nymphs were ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
though they knew him to be a cunning knave, yet they feared that his tricks
were done by ſome inchantment or witchcraft; and therefore they would needs go
out of that place which they thought ſwarmed with fiends and divels; but he took
them both by their arms, and ſaid, that ſince the doors were ſhut by the will of God,
they would greatly offend him, if they offered to open them before it was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
but he deſired them to let him know the cauſe of their coming thither, to the
end he might pray unto God to inſpire him with an anſwer. Though the Nymphs
were both afraid, yet partly by force, and partly by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

pleaſure, to come unto her, and as ſoon as poſſibly he could, becauſe ſhe had a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of great importance to communicate unto him, and delay might be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judical
unto her: We are not, Oh ſage Nymphs, (ſaid he unto them) like unto other
men, who may diſpoſe of themſelves after their own wills; for we, who have dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
our ſelves unto the ſervice of Heaven, neither ought nor can diſpoſe of our ſelves,
but according to the will of Heaven: and I muſt tell you more, that I am expreſly
forbidden to go out of the Limits which are appointed unto me by this Divinity,
without their expreſs permiſſion; and therefore, I cannot give you any direct anſwer
until I have conſulted with the Oracle: if you will pleaſe to come again unto me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
four or five dayes hence, you ſhall know what anſwer I receive from it; but in
the mean time, that we may have ſome knowledg of his future good will, let us of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
unto him a ſmall ſacrifice, which we will make of the Sacred Miſleto, Veruin, and
Savine, which are ſo pleaſing unto him. Upon this taking a few Oak leaves, and
making two Chaplets in form of Garlands, he put them upon their heads: then
lighting the fire upon the Altar, he threw in ſome of thoſe leaves before named;
laſtly, kneeling down, he ſeemed to make ſome prayers in a low voice, and when he
ſaw it was time, <hi>Oh Great and Omnipotent Deity,</hi> (ſaid he in a loud voice) <hi>if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
and ſupplications of theſe Nymphs be pleaſing unto thee, open thou the doors of
the Temple unto them, that after they have adored thee, they may go home unto their
houſes with content and ſatisfaction.</hi> The Nymphs hearing theſe words, took parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
notice of all the Actions of <hi>Climanthes,</hi> to ſee if they could ſpy by what trick
the doors were opened; but they ſeemed to open miraculouſly, for neither his
hand, nor any other part of his body moved, which could move them unto any
ſuſpition.</p>
                     <p>The doors then of the Temple being opened thus ſtrangely, this Impoſtor taking
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53527:142"/>
both the Nymphs by their hands, Go pure and innocent ſouls (ſaid he unto them)
Rejoyce in that the Heavens do love you, and for that there are few things which you
can ask that will be denied unto you: then conducting them forth, he uſed a few
Ceremonies, lifted up his hands and eyes to heaven, and returned to the ſame place
where he ſaw them when they firſt came: And becauſe they were extreamly afraid
that he was a Conjurer, they haſted away as faſt as they could, and thinking ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
followed them. But <hi>Climanthes</hi> thinking that perhaps they might hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſome Buſh neer, to ſee what he did, he kindled the fire upon the Altar, &amp; made
the doors ſhut of themſelves; which the Nymphs ſeeing as they looked back, fear
made them go away faſter then they came. Thus did the knavery of this wicked fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ſerve him for a cloak of piety.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galathea</hi> was not out of bed when <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Silvia</hi> returned, and when they
came unto her, they looked with ſuch affrighted looks, that <hi>Galathea</hi> thought at
firſt that they had met with ſome diſaſter: But when they related all that they had
ſeen, and their fears at the opening and ſhutting of the doors, ſhe could not chuſe
but laugh to ſee how they trembled at the very relation. I aſſure you Madam (ſaid
<hi>Silvia</hi> when ſhe ſaw <hi>Galathea</hi> laugh at them) that I am not of a very timorous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but I muſt confeſs that when I ſaw thoſe doors open and ſhut of themſelves, the
hair of my head began to ſtare, and I do think any that ſaw them would have done
the like. Good Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſuppoſe the doors of your chamber ſhould
thus open and ſhut of themſelves, would you not be afraid as well as we? We know
the man to be a knave, but withal, we fear that he deals with the Divel, and is a
Conjurer. No, no, ſaid the Nymph, you know he is a cunning fellow, and full of
jugling tricks, and he did them ſo ſlightly, that he deluded your eyes. No no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
anſwered <hi>Silvia,</hi> my companion and I both obſerved all his actions ſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that no motion, nor a caſt of his eye eſcaped us. However Madam (ſaid <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>)
we can aſſure you he is the ſame <hi>Climanthes</hi> which formerly we ſaw, and it is to
be believed that he has a deſigne in project by his ſtaying here: Whether he uſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration
or not, I aſſure you he uſeth abundance of Artifice and pains, and certainly
it is to ſome Deſigne of importance. But (ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi>) when did he promiſe to
come hither? How Madam! anſwered <hi>Silvia,</hi> promiſe to come hither? Nay, nay,
he is one that never moves a foot without God's leave; he ſays he will conſult with his
Oracle, and if we come about five days hence, he will tell us whither God will give
him leave to ſtir out of thoſe limits allotted to him: But for my part, I believe he
will conſult with one that has as many Divels at his command as I have hairs on my
head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galathea</hi> could not forbear laughing at their relation, and commanded them to
tell what they had done and ſeen unto all, eſpecially unto <hi>Adamas. Climanthes</hi> on
the other ſide ſpent all the reſt of the day in his wicked (though ſeeming) Devotion,
to the end that if any did come and ſurprize him, they might ſee his ſanctity: But
when it was night, and he thought none could ſee him, he locked up his Temple, put
on other clothes, went through the Wood unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> and acquainted him with all
the adventures of the day, and conſulted with him how to demean him ſelf towards
<hi>Galathea</hi> in her queſtions which ſhe ſhould ask. <hi>Polemas</hi> was much joyed when he
heard the Nymph had a mind to talk with <hi>Climanthes,</hi> aſſuring himſelf that now ſhe
gave credit unto his Art, which until then he made a doubt of. I do believe ſaid
<hi>Climanthes</hi> in anſwer unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> that the moſt ſubtle and cautelous men might
be deluded as well as theſe women; for never was deſigne carried on with more
prudence and circumſpection then ours: For my part think you what you pleaſe, I
can never be perſwaded they have the leaſt ſuſpition o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> any jugling in all that they
have ſeen; for I have been ſo punctual in every circumſtance, that I think any one
living might be deceived as well as they: whatſoever they were by my firſt devices, I
am moſt confident they are much more deluded by my ſecond.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt they were talking thus, a Meſſenger brought ſome news of concernment
unto <hi>Polemas:</hi> upon this their diſcourſe was interrupted; therefore making <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthes</hi>
to go into a Cloſet hard by, he cauſed the meſſenger to enter. Sir (ſaid
the meſſenger unto him, when he ſaw him alone in the chamber) your faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<hi>Meronthes</hi> ſalutes you, and hath commanded me to deliver this letter unto
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53527:142"/>
your own hand; and more, hath given me in charge after you have read it, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with ſome paſſages from him which relate unto your ſervice. <hi>Polemas</hi>
opening and reading the letter, and finding it only to be a letter of Credence, he took
him by the hand, and drew him as cloſe to the Cloſet where <hi>Climanthes</hi> was, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
he could, purpoſely that he might hear, aſſuring himſelf that it was ſomthing
which was neceſſary to be communicated unto him, becauſe <hi>Merontes</hi> was one of
the prime Burgomaſters of the City of <hi>Marſelles,</hi> and long ſince made his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
asking therefore of the meſſenger, who was his ſon, what he had to ſay, he
acquainted him with the arrival of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and the honour and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes
which <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> did unto them; the care which both of them had
of him, and the opinion which the Chirurgions had of him: Afterwards he gave
him an accompt of all the Souldiers that were in the Town, in what manner the
Guards were placed, the little ſuſpition that either <hi>Amaſis</hi> or <hi>Adamas</hi> had of any
attempts, and briefly aſſured him, that he would open a gate of the Town unto
him when he pleaſed: <hi>Polemas</hi> received this news with much joy; and after thanks
unto <hi>Merontes</hi> for his affection and fidelity, he conjured him to continue it, with
aſſurance that he would one day recompence him to the full: That when time ſerved,
he would make uſe of his offer, as from one whom he confided in, the moſt of any
man in the world: then fetching a bag of money which he kept always ready for a
recompence of ſecret Intelligences; Here ſaid he unto him, take this as an earneſt
of my good Will, and when occaſion ſerves, I will do more for you: But pray tell
me (ſaid he unto the man) is there any News at Court? Sir (ſaid the young man)
all the talk is of a <hi>Druide</hi> who lives neer <hi>Mount Briſon</hi> in ſo much ſanctity, that the
Gods do grant unto him whatſoever he asks: I cannot relate all the ſtories that are
told of him, for they are ſo many, and ſo ſtrange, as are incredible: His greateſt
reputation did ſpring from a voyage which <hi>Leonide</hi> did make unto him, who reports
ſuch wonders of him, as does aſtoniſh all hearers: Amongſt the reſt (ſaid <hi>Polemas</hi>)
what does ſhe report to have ſeen? Sir, anſwered the man, ſhe reports many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and amongſt the reſt, of the Door of the Temple, which opens and ſhuts of it
ſelf, at the very command of this holy Man. For my part Sir, I go but ſeldom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Caſtle, and what I report, is only by hear-ſay: But it is moſt certain, that
many ſtrange wonders are reported of this holy perſon. Well Sir, ſaid <hi>Polemas,</hi>
Return unto your Father, tell him, I give him a thouſand thanks for the News
which I have received by you, and ſhall one day be as forward in real recompence,
as I am now in my verbal thanks: Deſire him to continue in his Affection and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but above all, I deſire both him and you to be ſecret. Upon this, <hi>Polemas</hi>
diſmiſſed the meſſenger, and returned to <hi>Climanthes;</hi> who hearing what the man
reported of him, could not chuſe but laugh at the opinion which the world conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him: And let me tell you (ſaid he) that it is beyond the reach of a Female ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
to find out the Art which I have uſed. Good <hi>Climanthes</hi> (ſaid <hi>Polemas</hi>) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you tell me how you kindled the Fire upon your Altar, and how the Doors
did open and ſhut of themſelves at ſuch a diſtance from you; for I muſt confeſs I do
not underſtand how you can do it. The truth is, Sir, ſaid <hi>Climanthes,</hi> theſe Arts,
like all tricks of Legerdemain, are not to be underſtood by words, as they may be
moſt eaſily by ſight and demonſtration; for I have ordered my Engines in ſuch a
manner, as words cannot deſcribe them; but be aſſured, they are the eaſieſt things
in the world to be underſtood when they are once ſeen. I muſt needs ſay, replyed
<hi>Polemas,</hi> that <hi>Climanthes</hi> is a Maſter in his Art, and now I am fully perſwaded that
theſe Women are deceived by it: But dear friend, ſaid he, and embraced him, how
do you think our Deſigne will take? Doubtleſs Sir, ſaid he, as well as we can wiſh;
for though the event of future things be uncertain, yet take it upon my word, a
happy beginning is moſt commonly ſeconded by a happy end; and I am certain you
cannot deſire a more happy beginning then we have had. Within this Country all
is your own; and out of it, there is not one Prince nor Neighbour who does not
love and favour you: All thoſe that can any ways hinder you, are at a far diſtance
from you, and ſo employed in the affairs of others, that they give you time enough
to tranſact ours; The beſt of it is, <hi>Clidemant</hi> who is the only mote in your eye, he
is ſo engaged in the aſſiſtance of a Prince ſo far diſtant from us, that any relief from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53527:143"/>
him is not to be feared; whereas your Confederates and Allies, are at hand, ſo as we
ſhall meet with no oppoſition, unleſs from a Company of weak women, who though
very potent in Wars of Love, yet are they but pitifully weak in the Wars of <hi>Mars.</hi>
But you muſt conſider, replied <hi>Polemas,</hi> that <hi>Adamas</hi> whoſe good will, will never
be gained, is a very conſiderable enemy, by reaſon of the credit and reputation that
he has in this Country; the authority of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and the averſe diſpoſition of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi>
will be great hindrances unto us. Pray Sir conſider, anſwered <hi>Climanthes,</hi>
that every thing will act according to its own nature: <hi>Adamas</hi> may hurt you in
words, but not in deeds; take but Arms, and all his books are not worth a ruſh. As
for <hi>Amaſis,</hi> ſhe is ſo affectionate unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> as ſhe will not croſs her in any
thing ſhe ſhall deſire: there is the greateſt difficulty, replied <hi>Polemas,</hi> for <hi>Galathea</hi>
is young, and has no conſideration of the States tranquility, but all her deſignes
and inclinations, are croſs and averſe unto mine. How know you that? replied
<hi>Climanthes,</hi> perhaps ſhe deſires it as much as you, but knows not how to bring it
about: I pray tell me, Has ſhe not formerly loved you? True, anſwered <hi>Polemas,</hi>
but <hi>Lindamore</hi> has ſtoln her affection from me: Pray Sir conſider, ſaid <hi>Climanthes,</hi>
that what was once, may be again. The Nature of a woman, eſpecially of a young
one, is very wavering; catches at every object of novelty that pleaſeth the eyes, and
fixes ſolidly upon none, her mind is like a Ship at Sea without any Anchor or ſtay,
which flotes as every wind pleaſeth. Now if we may be conjectures gueſſe all things
hidden, I muſt needs think ſhe is fully intended to obſerve whatſoever I ſhall bid
her; why elſe ſhould ſhe ſend <hi>Leonide</hi> unto me, to deſire that I ſhould come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
unto her? I am either extreamly miſtaken, or elſe I ſee her heart infinitely
impatient to ſee me, with intentions to put her ſelf wholly into my hands; aſſure
your ſelf, that I gave her a very hot allarm, when I told her that if ſhe married any
but him whom the Gods had appointed for her, ſhe would be the moſt unhappy
woman alive. But ſuppoſe, ſaid <hi>Polemas,</hi> ſhe ſhould diſcover your ſubtilty? But
ſuppoſe (ſaid <hi>Climanthes</hi>) the sky ſhould fall? There is as much likelyhood of the
one as of the other: I would have you to know, that <hi>Climanthes</hi> is ſuch a Maſter in
his Art, that if he would attempt to make <hi>Amaſis</hi> marry him, he could bring it to
paſs. <hi>Polemas</hi> laughed and ſaid, I wiſh with all my heart that I were a witneſs of
your marriage with her, and you of mine with <hi>Galathea.</hi> No, no, ſaid <hi>Climanthes,</hi>
I would be contented with <hi>Leonide,</hi> Oh my dear friend (ſaid <hi>Polemas</hi>) when I do
marry <hi>Galathea,</hi> I will promiſe you <hi>Leonide:</hi> and I promiſe you, ſaid <hi>Climanthes,</hi>
that I will give you <hi>Galathea</hi> within a few dayes, or elſe I will loſe my life. Upon
this the queſtion grew, whether he ſhould make <hi>Galathea</hi> come unto him, or he go
unto her; at laſt it was concluded better for him to go unto her, becauſe in making
her come into the Temple it was to be feared, leſt his tricks in opening and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the doors, might ſome way or other miſcarry or be diſcovered, and then the
whole plot was ſpoiled: beſides, thoſe things that are taken for wonders at the firſt,
and admired, do grow ſtale by often uſing, and ſcorned: Moreover, ſince this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and ſhutting is believed to be the Act of God, it will be thought ſtrange that
this God can do nothing but ſtill one and the ſame things. But by going to the
Palace, all theſe things are not to be expected, and nothing is to be done but tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with her. Upon this they parted full of hopes to arrive ere long at their deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ends.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Polemas</hi> who was a man of a ſharp wit, and a ſound judgment, and a ſpirit
ſwell'd with ambition, although he ſeemed to rely wholy upon the skil of <hi>Climanthes,</hi>
yet he neglected nothing which might bring his enterpriſe to paſs; and though he
had ſome hopes in the ſubtilty of this fellow, yet he followed his other buſineſs very
cloſe, ſo that if the ſubtilty of the one failed, the force of the other might effect it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Souldiers of that Province, he had entertained many others, both within
and without the State: He had made himſelf maſter of all the ſtrong places, brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and paſſes; and not to do any thing at random, there was neither King nor
Prince his Neighbour, with whom he had not cloſe intelligence, and promiſe of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in caſe of need; he provided himſelf of a vaſt Magazine of Arms, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Amunition. And becauſe the whole management of all theſe correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and the whole enterpriſe reſted upon himſelf, he made choiſe of four men
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53527:143"/>
whom he imployed in things particular: theſe four confidents whom he relied upon,
were the four pillars of all his hopes and fortune; the name of the one was <hi>Pelidon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
unto whom he committed the charge of his Cavalry: another was called <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi>
unto whom he committed his Infantry; <hi>Liſtrandes</hi> had the command of the
Artillery, and Engines; and <hi>Ligonias</hi> of the Amunition and victual. Theſe four
were acquainted with the deſign of <hi>Polemas,</hi> and had long ſince contracted a league,
and linked their fortunes and lives together. As ſoon as <hi>Climanthes</hi> was gone, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas</hi>
called for them, and asked them particularly, how many men he might build
upon, if within the compaſs of eight or ten dayes he ſhould have occaſion to imploy
them? <hi>Pelidontes</hi> promiſed him fifteen hundred horſe, and beſides all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Country, two thouſand ſtrangers: <hi>Argonides</hi> promiſed twelve thouſand
Pikes, Archers, Slingers, and Croſs-bows, and ſix thouſand ſtrangers: <hi>Ligonias</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
victual for four months: and <hi>Liſtrandes</hi> promiſed as many Arms of all ſorts as
they ſhould need: now my friends, ſaid he and embraced them, my hopes are all
in you; I do wholly rely upon you, and know that you will have as great a care of
my buſineſs, as I my ſelf can have; perhaps we ſhall not ſtand in need of all theſe
preparations, I hope Heaven will bring our enterpriſe to paſs by fair means, and
not by force. I deſire it may be ſo, as well for the good of the State, as becauſe that
way ſeems every way the better. However, all preparations moſt go forward, for I
am reſolved, within eight dayes to be either <hi>Caſar</hi> or nothing; I beſeech you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and conjure you to have a great care of every thing under your particular
charges, that they may be in readineſs when we ſhall ſtand in need of them. Thus
with abundance of good language, and a thouſand large promiſes, they parted;
and hoped to ſee the day when he ſhould be able to make them all good.</p>
                     <p>But whilſt the mind of <hi>Polemas</hi> thus boyled over with ambition, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was ready to break out into a flame: Love ſtill boyled as faſt as ambition, for it
gave no reſt unto <hi>Celadon</hi> whom <hi>Leonide</hi> left in the habit of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and in the houſe
of <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> who with all her Companions could not know him to be <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſo
well was he diſguiſed: But the wonder is, that neither <hi>Licidas,</hi> nor any of his neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
kindred or intimate friends ſhould have the leaſt ſuſpition of him; and that was
the reaſon why <hi>Phoceon,</hi> when <hi>Adamas</hi> brought her into his houſe, did lodg her
in the Chamber where <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was wont to lie: and indeed that Fair Shepherdeſs
and her Companion <hi>Phillis,</hi> when <hi>Leonide</hi> was gone unto <hi>Marſelles,</hi> did endeavour
to ſleep, that they might let this diſguiſed <hi>Druide</hi> take ſome reſt, whom they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be not well. But this new, or indeed old affection renewed, which <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
bore unto this Shepherd, believing him a woman, and her reſolution to follow her
unto <hi>Carnutes,</hi> and conſecrate the remainder of her dayes unto <hi>Tautates,</hi> did ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
her mind, that ſhe could not entertain any thought or imagination, but what
proceeded from them and that deſire. <hi>Phillis</hi> on the other ſide, who knew how the
Fair and Wiſe <hi>Diana</hi> was perplexed ever ſince the ſubtile <hi>Laonices</hi> invention againſt
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſhe bad deffiance unto any reſt till ſhe went unto her to comfort her in
her grief, knowing very well by ſad experience, what it was to be troubled with the
panges of jealouſie. <hi>Celadon</hi> who lay in the ſame Chamber with theſe Fair Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes,
had his enquietudes as well as they, and took as little reſt; for calling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his memory how <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had formerly appointed him never to ſee her until by
her command; when he conſidered his reſolution to obſerve this ordinance moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly,
and thought upon the reaſons which the wiſe <hi>Adamas</hi> uſed to make him
quit that ſolitary kind of life, which he had begun when he reflected upon the artifice
which <hi>Leonide</hi> and the <hi>Druide</hi> uſed to bring him, not only into his own Town, and
amongſt his kindred, but alſo into the very houſe of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and leave him alone
with her; theſe thoughts did ſo imbroyl the imagination of this poor Shepherd, that
he knew not what Councel, or what reſolution to take; for though he had the ſame
thoughts in his mind before, yet the ſeveral reaſon and arguments of the Nymph,
and the <hi>Druide,</hi> did help him to diſgeſt them; but now when he was all alone, he
thought himſelf ſurrounded with a thouſand dangers, and without all humane help
or comfort. He conſidered that now he was amongſt abundance of his familiar
and intimate acquaintance, and that it was a thing almoſt impoſſible, to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
long from them: and though the prudence of the great <hi>Druide Adamas,</hi> who
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53527:144"/>
did acknowledge him for his Daughter, did caſt a miſt before the eyes of thoſe that
were the moſt clear ſighted, and much authorize his diſguiſe; yet he knew very
well, that thoſe eyes which he was to deceive, were ſo quick ſighted, that if any of
his actions or words ſhould betray him, he was ſure his diſſimulation would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
diſcovered: Upon this conſideration, he bethought himſelf how prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant he was to ſeem of knowing any thing which related unto the quality of a
Shepherd, how ſimple he was to ſeem in their way of life, their exerciſes, and how
unacquainted he was to be with all his friends, kinred, acquaintances, and places, he
thought this a task impoſſible to be undertaken; and though he did all he could,
yet the face of <hi>Alexis</hi> was ſo very like unto that of <hi>Celadon,</hi> all her words, actions,
and geſtures were ſo reſemblant unto that ſuppoſed loſt Shepherd, as doubtleſs he
ſhould be known in ſpite of all his diſſimulations and diſguiſements. But his hardeſt
task was, to rule and check a moſt domineering paſſion, which amidſt his greateſt
felicities, would not give his ſoul leave to enjoy any full contentment. How oft did
he command his tongue and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ds not to take too much liberty unto themſelves, leſt
they ſhould betray himſelf to be <hi>Celadon?</hi> How oft did he turn away his eye from
many Beauties which under the notion of <hi>Alexis</hi> were permitted unto him; and all,
leſt his too much curioſity ſhould bring him into ſuſpicion.</p>
                     <p>After all theſe conſiderations had long embroyled his mind, and the more he
thought upon them, the more <hi>Hydras</hi> of difficulties he found, the beſt counſel he
could think upon, was, to reſolve to ſtay in that place as little as he could, knowing
it to be a thing impoſſible to ſtay, and not be known, and that the ſureſt foot may
ſomtimes ſtumble; but this reſolution he thought to be as full of difficulties in the
execution, and therefore he reſolved to ſtay ſtill in that place: Upon which he began
to think how he ſhould employ himſelf; and he conceived that he could no way
better ſpend his time, then in ſtill engaging that Shepherdeſs unto a ſtronger league
of amity, thinking very rationally, that if ſhe ſhould afterwards come to know him,
ſhe would not ſo ſoon conſent unto a ſecond Baniſhment. And becauſe he knew
that we are much led by the examples of thoſe whom we eſteem, and ſhall after them
do thoſe things which otherwiſe we ſhould never conſent unto, he intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
a love unto her; not ſuch a kinde of love as one woman uſeth to expreſs unto
another, but ſuch a one as <hi>Celadon</hi> was wont to expreſs unto <hi>Astrea,</hi> and thus by
his example to draw her unto the like affection, and ſo inſenſibly to bring her from
Friendſhip unto Love. But when he was to put this thought in execution, he found
abundance of more difficulty in acting, then in propounding it; it being a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to expreſs love unto that Shepherdeſs, and not make her to ſuſpect it to be more
then became a Virgin <hi>Druide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This chaos and confuſion of difficulties did ſo diſtemper him, that he could not
chuſe but ſigh very oft, and ſo loud, that the two Shepherdeſſes could not chuſe
but hear him; for they did not ſleep, only ſeemed as if they did, becauſe they would
not diſturb the reſt of <hi>Alexis.</hi> But hearing her to ſigh ſo exceedingly, and knowing
her to be awake, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> feared, that though ſhe ſaid that ſhe ſeemed ſick, only as a
colour for ſtaying with her, yet I ſay ſhe feared leſt ſome real diſtemper ſhould be
the cauſe of ſo many ſighs. This doubt cauſed her to turn towards <hi>Phillis,</hi> whom
ſhe knew was awake: Siſter (ſaid ſhe in as low a voice as ſhe could) do you not hear
<hi>Alexis</hi> ſigh? I am afraid that ſhe is worſe then ſhe will tell unto us. I heard her
ſigh ſeveral times (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>) and I had the ſame conceipt, but me-thought they
were ſighs of one that was rather full of cares, then of one that was ſick: For ſighs
of a ſick perſon are fetched from the breaſt with more violence, and thoſe which I
hear, are but ſilent whiſpering ſighs, ſuch as proceed from paſſion and diſtemper of
mind. I think, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that we ſhould do well if we diverted her from ſuch ſad
thoughts, and yet if ſhe be aſleep, we ſhould not waken her. Certainly, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi>
ſhe is not aſleep, for ſhe has turned her ſelf ſeveral times, but perhaps ſhe is ſilent
upon the ſame reaſon that we are, I mean, leſt we ſhould diſturb each other. <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
being very impatient to ſee whether it was ſo, ſhe opened her curtain and peeped out;
but ſhe could not do it ſo ſoftly, but <hi>Alexis</hi> obſerved her, who for all his confuſed
thoughts, had his eye and his heart towards her, and who had not lain ſo long in
bed, but only to make <hi>Phillis</hi> believe her ſickneſs was real. <hi>Astrea</hi> perceiving that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53527:144"/>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> was not aſleep, Madam (ſaid ſhe unto her) we are much afraid you are very
ill, for we have heard you complain very much ſince <hi>Leonide</hi> wakened you. I thank
you heartily, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> for your care of me, which were I worſe then I am,
would make me well again: yet truly I am not very well, and therefore I deſire not
to ſtir out of the chamber this morning, but will try whether a little head-ach will be
cured with a little reſt. Madam, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I have heard ſay that ſleep is the beſt
remedy againſt that diſeaſe. I have tryed to ſleep ſince <hi>Leonide</hi> went, replied <hi>Alexis</hi>
but I could not perſwade my eyes together, becauſe many odd thoughts came into
my mind, ſo as I think the beſt way will be to divert it by diſcourſe; for I have heard
ſay, that pain will away when it is leaſt thought upon. What then ſhall we do, ſaid
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> to make you forget your pain? I deſire, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> that you will
come and dreſs your ſelves by me, and paſs away the time with your ſweet diſcourſe.
Madam (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) we will do any thing in the world to obey you: upon this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
out of bed, ſhe put on her Gown: But <hi>Alexis</hi> remembring that ſhe promiſed
to dreſs her ſelf that day in the habit of a <hi>Druide,</hi> ſhe claimed her promiſe. Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart
(ſaid ſhe unto her) if you will make good your promiſe, and aſſume the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of a <hi>Druide</hi> this day, it would be a very great content unto me. Oh Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
ſhe, you would never pardon me, if I ſhould commit ſo groſs a crime: Indeed
it is too much preſumption for a ſilly Shepherdeſs. It may be ſo, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi>
for a ſilly Shepherdeſs, but not for ſuch a Shepherdeſs as <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is, whoſe merits,
beauty, and perfections does tranſcend all the <hi>Druides</hi> that I do know; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you will oblige me, lay all ſuch conſiderations aſide: for the love of you I
was a Shepherdeſs, and will be ſo as long as you pleaſe; why then for the love of me
ſhould not you as well become a <hi>Druide:</hi> Come, come, continued ſhe, Were I but
dreſt, I would not put you to the trouble of coming hither, but ſince I am in bed, I
beſeech you ſweet-heart come hither, and let me help to dreſs you. The Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs
in obedience to this command, went to <hi>Alexis,</hi> who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aiſing her ſelf in the bed,
and cloſing her ſmock leſt her Breaſts ſhould be diſcovered, did receive her with ſuch
raviſhment of joy, as it was well <hi>Phillis</hi> was on the other ſide of the bed dreſſing
her ſelf, for it was to be feared that had ſhe ſeen them, ſhe would have entred into
ſome ſuſpition: and though <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was aſhamed of it, yet ſuch careſſes were now
grown ſo accuſtomed, that ſhe took all in good part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Celadon</hi> had a good will to continue his careſſes longer, but ſome conſiderations
moved him to give over ſooner then he had a mind, and helping her to dreſs her ſelf,
her Breaſts, and almoſt every part of her fair Body was open to his eye, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
raviſhed at the ſight of ſo many tranſcendent perfections, ſhe deſired that <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
were another <hi>Argus,</hi> full of eyes, that he might the better contemplate all
thoſe excellencies: His wonder at them ſo took up his mind, that not knowing what
he did, he did and undid every thing about the dreſſing of her, above three or four
times; at which <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who did not obſerve from whence the fault proceeded,
could not chuſe but ſmile, and reward his erroneous pains with many careſſes, which
the timorous <hi>Druide</hi> durſt hardly repay, leſt his actions ſhould diſcover more then
became <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſo as it may be ſaid, that Love was moſt ſparing, when it was moſt
prodigal of its favours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phillis</hi> in the mean time was dreſſing her ſelf as faſt as ſhe could; and becauſe ſhe
did not uſe much art in trimming up her ſelf, ſhe was ready before <hi>Alexis</hi> had got
on <hi>Aſtreas</hi> Gown; at which ſhe ſmiled, and ſaid unto them, If you be as long about
all the reſt as this you have done, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> will be ready about the time when others
are going to Bed. No matter for time, Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for it cannot be better
ſpent then in diverting the pain of the fair <hi>Alexis.</hi> If that be your Deſigne, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhe, it is well employed; but if it be only to paſs away the time with that fair
<hi>Druide,</hi> I know a better diverſion then yours; and if you will give me leave, I will
go and fetch one that will ſecond me, and help out better then I can do: Beſides
Siſter, you know that if neither of us go unto her upon this occaſion, we ſhall be
exceedingly to blame. Of whom do you ſpeak, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> if I be not trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
in asking the queſtion. Alas Madam, replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> it is we that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
in talking of ſuch things before you; for indeed 'tis too much pains for you
to hear our trivial affairs: Then turning towards <hi>Phillis,</hi> Go ſiſter (continued ſhe)
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53527:145"/>
and aſſure her we all believe that all which is reported is falſe. <hi>Phillis</hi> then as ſhe
went away, I need not ask (ſaid ſhe) where I ſhall find you at my return, ſince it
is not likely you will ſtir out of this chamber. If the diſtemper of the fair <hi>Alexis</hi>
would give her leave to ſtir out, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I believe you might find us in the
Grove of <hi>Hazles</hi> ſooner then in any other place, but I believe you will find us here
at your return.</p>
                     <p>Upon this <hi>Phillis</hi> went out of the chamber, and <hi>Alexis</hi> with a ſmiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
ſaid unto <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> Do not think that the Grove of <hi>Hazles</hi> does delight me more
then any other place where the fair <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is; for where ſhe is not, no place is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
unto me: It befits me Madam, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> to uſe the ſame words, ſince
I have no contentment but in your preſence, nor no ambition but in the honour of
your favour, which I deſire above all the world. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> you need not
deſire that which you do moſt entirely poſſeſs. Indeed Madam, replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
I cannot wiſh for any addition unto my happineſs, further then the continuance of
it; nor deſire any more, but to employ all the reſt of my days in doing you ſervice,
and never be abſent from you: I have already entreated the Nymph <hi>Leonide</hi> to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
me with her credit and advice in order thereunto; and though ſhe urged ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great obſtacles unto me, yet I account them but trifles in compariſon of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
which I ſhould have in it: As for the contrariety of my Parents, which ſhe
thinks ſo great an impediment unto my deſired happineſs, ſince it hath pleaſed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to take from me my Father and my Mother, what Parent have I that has any
dominion over my Will, or can hinder me from dedicating my ſelf unto that courſe
which the very Laws of Nature do oblige all Humanes unto? Upon this ground I
do but laugh at the pretenſions of <hi>Calidon,</hi> who thinks me his own already, becauſe
my uncle <hi>Phocion</hi> would have me marry him; for I know well enough how far the
obedience and reſpect which I owe unto him does extend: I know him to be ſo wiſe
and diſcreet a perſon, that he will not look for any more obſervance then I pay unto
him: But Madam, my fears and my doubts ariſe not from that ſide; the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
is to obtain your favour, and the conſent of the ancient <hi>Druides,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
amongſt the Virgins of <hi>Carnutes,</hi> that ſo I may never be abſent from you:
This Madam, is the humble petition of your devoted creature, which I beg with all
the humble and moſt affectionate ſupplications I am able to expreſs. Fair Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs
(anſwered <hi>Alexis</hi>) I cannot thank you enough for all your affectionate expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of good will towards me, and I have ſuch an eſteem of it, as I do wiſh with as
much zeal as poſſibly you can, that we may never part as long as we live; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be aſſured it ſhall be long only of your ſelf, if ever we ſeparate: But my fear
is, that when I tell you what is to be done, your mind will change, and your deſign
alter. Oh Madam cried out <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I beſeech you wrong me not ſo far, as to have
ſuch a thought. But on the contrary, be moſt certainly aſſur'd, that both in life and
death this reſolution will continue in me. I am apt to believe (anſwered <hi>Alexis</hi>)
any thing that you ſhall ſay, eſpecially a thing which is ſo advantagious unto my
ſelf, and ſo ſutable to my deſires; believe it therefore that I will do all I can to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your deſires. Know Shepherdeſs that there is no great difficulty in bringing
your deſire to paſs, if you will your ſelf; and in this I am contrary to the opinion of
<hi>Leonide.</hi> Theſe two things, I ſhall only require from you; the one is, that you do
love me, as well as I do you: and I ſhall tell you the other, when I ſee you have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
this firſt propoſition. <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> with a ſmiling look, kiſſed the hand of <hi>Alexis,</hi>
by way of thanks: If your ſecond propoſition (ſaid ſhe) be no harder then your
firſt, you have good reaſon to ſay Madam, that there is no great difficulty in the
matter. For I beſeech you, give me leave to ſwear, that if I do not Love the Fair
<hi>Alexis</hi> far above my own ſelf, nay better then ever any perſon loved another, then
let the Gods deny me the honour of your favour, and blaſt all my hopes of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment:
Oh <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> do you think for all this, that you love me
more then I Love you? Oh Madam, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I cannot think my ſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of ſo much affection from you; but ſhould think my ſelf infinitely happy if I were
ſure that mine to you were accepted: Faireſt Shepherdeſs, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that never Love did equal mine unto you; and in this, I cannot be deceived as
you may, becauſe I know what I ſay by experience; for I think I told you, how
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53527:145"/>
formerly I did Love one of my fellow Virgins, and I am confident it was impoſſible
for any humane to equal my affection to her; but when I do compare my affection
unto her, and my affection unto you together, I find that they hold no compariſon,
for mine unto you do infinitely tranſcend that unto her. Whereas you on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
who never Loved any, you may eaſily be miſtaken, and think your Love great
when it is not ſo, for you want experience. Madam, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> the diſpute
betwixt us is of ſuch a nature, that the victory is prejudicial to the Conqueror; and
the conquered is victorious: and yet I will not throw away my Arms upon very eaſie
terms, though I will yeild unto you in what you pleaſe, but it would be a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
ſhame unto me, if I ſhould let you outſtrip me in affection as you do in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Give me leave Madam therefore to tell you, that I began to Love when I was
even in my Cradle, and have continued that affection ſo conſtantly, that no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
no time, no abſences, no commands of thoſe that had the diſpoſe of me, nor
any thing under Heaven could divert me from it, but death only: and yet I ſwear,
and ſwear moſt truly, that I do Love you better then ever I loved any; and though
this be but a proud word to iſſue from the mouth of a poor Shepherdeſs, yet give
me leave to pronounce it, and ſay again, that though others may bear a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
yet never any more Love and more Affection, then <hi>Aſtrea</hi> unto the Fair <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis.</hi>
Upon this, they embraced each other with ſuch mutual expreſſions of Love,
that if <hi>Alexis</hi> durſt, but have ſaid I am <hi>Celadon,</hi> nothing could have made them
both more happy in each other. But the feares of this <hi>Druide,</hi> did make her reliſh
all theſe ſweet imbraces with a kind of bitter amongſt them, becauſe ſhe ſtill feared
leſt her raptures of joy ſhould make her diſcover her ſelf; and therefore ſhe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
her ſelf a little with a bluſhing collour which came into her cheeks; and after
ſhe had ſtood a while ſilent, ſhe uttered theſe words with ſuch a modeſt ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that if any of her actions had raiſed any doubts of what ſhe deſired to hide, it
was enough to clear them all. But faireſt Shepherdeſs (ſaid ſhe unto her) I cannot
tell, what the violence of my affection to you, may make you think of me, unleſs yours
and your goodneſs plead me excuſe: and yet I do ſwear unto you by <hi>Veſta,</hi> and all
that is ſacred, that I am ſo far from any ſuch affections as many women of my age
are apt unto, that I did never love any man: but all my paſſions were wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in my love of one woman, whom truly I did love as much as I was then able,
though not comparable unto you now; and though perhaps you may laugh at my
humour, yet I muſt tell you, that I took as great delight in kiſſing and careſſing of
her, as if I had been a man, or ſhe not a woman. And indeed I find the very ſame
humour to revive in me when I am with you, which I can attribute unto nothing but
the exceſs of my affection which I bear unto you, and which I ſhould be infinitely
ſorry if it were diſpleaſing or troubleſome unto you: <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſhewing by her
countenance, how well ſhe was pleaſed with theſe expreſſions, did return this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
It is my part Madam, to uſe the ſame excuſes unto you, ſince I have more
reaſon to fear being troubleſome unto you, by following the inclination of my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
too far: I muſt needs confeſs Madam, that I did Love a Shepherd; but let me
tell you truly, that I was never more joyed at any teſtimonies of his good will unto
me, then I am of yours.</p>
                     <p>Oh Heaven! (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) how much am I obliged unto it, and you, for this
affection: my joyes and my ſatisfaction is compleat. But Faireſt Shepherdeſs (ſaid
ſhe) ſhall we live together, in the ſame freedom and affection when we are together
in private, that we do now? I ſay in private; for it is fit to be more reſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
other Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, leaſt we ſhould give occaſion to ſuſpect us
of ſomthing which may be diſadvantagious unto us. How? Madam, (ſaid <hi>Astrea</hi>)
do you ask me this queſtion? Nay, may you not better ask whether I ſhould not die
for ſorrow, if you ſhould forbid me? But Madam, ſince you ſee I have obſerved
your firſt command, I beſeech you what is the other? That by obeying it alſo, I
may call my ſelf the woſt happy woman alive. Faireſt Shepherdeſs, (anſwered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi>)
it is not yet time to tell it; but ſince I ſee you are deſirous to know it, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you, that when I think it fitting that you ſhould know it, I will not put you to
the trouble of asking me. In the mean time, to try whether this kind of life will be
as agreeable unto us as we imagine, let us begin to live together as we muſt do all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53527:146"/>
the reſt of our dayes; I mean, with that honeſt freedom and liberty that two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Lovers ought to uſe unto each other. In the firſt place I beſeech you, let us
leave off in our diſcourſe, theſe terms of Madam, and <hi>Druide,</hi> and begin to be free
and familiar, as we muſt for ever be. Madam, (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) in what place ſoever I
be, and of what quality ſoever I am, I will alwayes render unto you, thoſe reſpects
which I am bound to pay; that will not be any hindrance to thoſe contentments
which I hope for from you, but rather further them by keeping my ſelf within the
terms of my duty. You are miſtaken, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> and though you can have
ſo much power over your ſelf, yet I cannot; for I am not able to endure that one
whom I take to be my other ſelf, ſhould uſe ſuch words as ſpeak any difference
betwixt us: and if the principal conſequence of Love be union, why ſhould we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ſuch Tyrannies diſguiſed, under the names of reſpect, or civility, or duty, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that perfect union of wills, which ought to be betwixt us? I do ordain therefore
that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſhall be <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> ſhall be <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and that we baniſh from
amongſt us, not only all words, but alſo all manner of actions that may put any
difference between us, and you ſhall ſee that when we have lived long in this mutual
freedom and liberty, Love wil double and ſtill encreaſe. Then Madam, replied <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea,</hi>
I beſeech you let it be under the notion of a command, that my obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it may excuſe the fault which I ſhall commit in it. If that be all (anſwered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi>)
to ſatisfie you, I do command it, with a promiſe that I will not repent it as
long as I live. And becauſe it is fit we conform our ſelves unto the cuſtoms of thoſe
with whom we are to live: know therefore Shepherdeſs that it is the cuſtom of the
<hi>Druides</hi> at <hi>Carnutes,</hi> not to call themſelves by their proper names, but by
others, which their affection unto one another makes them invent; and their new
names are called amongſt them, <hi>Alliances,</hi> as much as to ſay that they are Allied
and obliged by thoſe names unto more Affection and Love. I conceive it requiſite
we do the like as well to confirm our Loves, as to let thoſe <hi>Druides</hi> ſee when we
come amongſt them, that we do not only know their cuſtoms, but moſt religiouſly
obſerve them: now I cannot think of any which are fitter for us then the names of
Miſtris and Servant, as well becauſe they are names not ordinary amongſt them, as
becauſe me thinks they ſound well betwixt you and me. I do accept of this honour,
ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> with a thouſand thanks, and with a proteſtation and vow unto the
Goddeſs <hi>Vesta,</hi> that for ever, not only in name but in deed I will take you for my
Miſtris, and profeſs my ſelf your ſervant. <hi>Alexis</hi> ſmiled at this, I had rather, ſaid
ſhe, that you would take the name of Miſtris, and let me have that of ſervant: but
ſince you have made your choiſe, I am contented: Now Servant (continued ſhe)
give me your hand, in teſtimony that you accept of this name, and that you will
never break this alliance of Love which we now make; and I ſwear by the Great
God of Love, who is the God that is adored at <hi>Carnutes,</hi> that I will eternally live
with you as with the only perſon whom I perfectly Love, and of whom only I deſire
to be Loved in the like manner. Then <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſaid, I do not only give my hand,
but both hands, nay more, my heart and my ſoul, in teſtimony, that I will love you
and you only, conſecrating and dedicating my ſelf, my deſires, my affections, and
all that is mine unto you: and if ever I fail in the obſervance of this promiſe, or
ever ſtain that honourable Name which I have received, let me be abhorred by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, and all that is in them. Upon this they both embraced and kiſſed
each other, as an aſſurance of what they had promiſed; and carraſſed themſelves
with ſo much affection as if they would never have ended.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Phillis</hi> went unto <hi>Diana,</hi> thinking to find her in bed, but that
Shepherdeſs was ſo very ill pleaſed, that ſhe could not reſt ſo long; for ſhe was up
long before, and after ſhe had put all things into order in her little houſe, ſhe went
out with her flock, and without any other company but her own thoughts. By
fortune, ſhe came unto the ſame place upon the Banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> when the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of <hi>Celadon</hi> did happen, when the jealouſie of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> made him throw himſelf
into the River. After ſhe had ſeated her ſelf, and long looked upon the current of
the water, without any other action which ſhewed life, but only ſighing; at laſt,
as if ſhe had revived out of a profound Lethargy, and ſending forth a deep ſigh.
Thus (ſaid ſhe) does all things mortal, run into the Gulf of Oblivion: then ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53527:146"/>
a while, ſhe broke out thus. This River is not the ſame water it was yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
for it glides away, and freſh comes in the room of it; nay I my ſelf am not the
ſame <hi>Diana</hi> that I was when I came hither: time by an uncontrollable power runs
on and drives all before it. The Sun it ſelf, which is the meaſure of time as all things
in the univerſe is, is hurried on by time, and is not the ſame it was when I began to
ſpeak: why then <hi>Diana</hi> ſhouldeſt thou think an ordinary thing to be ſtrange and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary?
Every thing changes, and rechanges again: If it be a generall Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all things, that nature produceth to change, why ſhouldſt thou wonder that
one particular perſon ſhould do ſo? It is very unreaſonable to obſerve it in thy ſelf,
and not allow it in another: canſt thou ſay that it is not thy ſelf which doth change,
but art the ſame thou wert wont to be? Ah fond flatterer of thy ſelf, remember what
thou wert before <hi>Fiiander</hi> ſaw thee, what operation his Courtſhip had upon thee?
and how thou didſt behave thy ſelf after his deplorable loſs. Conſider thy humour
as it was when <hi>Sylvander,</hi> or rather that deceive, began firſt unluckily to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee: How waſt thou won by his counterfet affection? And how doſt thou find
thy ſelf now after a knowledg of his treaſon? Needs muſt thou confeſs, that as the
humours, complexions, and tempers, do change once every ſeven yeers; thine chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
ofter, and not only in ſeven yeers, for a year is an age unto thee, but in a month,
in a week, in an hour, nay even in a munite.</p>
                     <p>This thought touched her to the quick; for never having this opinion of her ſelf
before, yet finding it now to be true, ſhe was ſo aſtoniſhed at it, that ſhe was
not able to utter one word. At the laſt, rouſing her ſelf up, as out of a dead ſleep,
ſhe began again thus: Oh Heavens! Oh Earth! art thou not changed? Yes yes,
<hi>Diana,</hi> and ſo that if thou doſt but look well upon thy ſelf, thou wilt hardly know
thy ſelf, thou wilt not find any thing of the firſt <hi>Diana</hi> in thee, but only the very
Name. Anſwer me, I pray thee to theſe queſtions; how didſt thou heretofore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
the flatteries of men, what credit waſt thou wont to give unto their ſupple lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage?
Haſt thou quite loſt the memory of all thoſe wiſe inſtructions and good
Counſels thou wert wont to give thy companions? Or doſt thou think that thy ſelf
does not need them as much as they? Ah <hi>Diana!</hi> do not deceive thy ſelf, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that thou art now much different from what thou wert wont to be. Recollect
thy ſelf a little better, and tell me; doſt thou not remember the time when thou
wert the firſt <hi>Diana,</hi> and when all that this coſening Shepherd either ſaid or did, was
indifferent unto thee? And why ſhould thou now, if thou art the ſame <hi>Diana,</hi> be
angry at this loving <hi>Madonthe,</hi> at his following her, and at his going with her,
whether ſhe would or no? If theſe things do vex thee, then confeſs that thou art
not the ſame <hi>Diana;</hi> and if thou doſt deny it, will not thy own conſcience accuſe
thee? Well, (ſaid ſhe) if I be not the ſame <hi>Diana</hi> I was wont to be, then what
am I become now? Quite contrary (anſwered ſhe) to that <hi>Diana</hi> I was wont to
be: Oh Heavens! what a deplorable alteration is this? How much better and more
honourable had it been for me to have dyed in the dayes of the firſt <hi>Diana,</hi> then have
lived to ſee this alteration?</p>
                     <p>When ſhe was in the height of her diſpleaſure againſt her ſelf, ſhe was diverted
by the coming of ſome Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, which talked and diſputed
amongſt themſelves very vehemently; and though ſhe was very buſie in her own
perplexed thoughts, yet they making a great noiſe, and ſhe hearing them a far off,
ſhe had time enough to withdraw her ſelf unſeen, behind a great Buſh, which grew
cloſe to the way; which ſhe did with intention to let them paſs on, and then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
unto the place again, and continue on thoſe thoughts which they had interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but ſhe was diſappointed; for they, as if it was upon ſome expreſs deſign, went
ſtraight to the place from whence <hi>Diana</hi> came, and ſeated themſelves upon the bank,
as if they intended to ſtay there a long time: but ſhe fearing to be diſcovered, and
perhaps conſtrained to remain with them, according to the Laws of civility, which
were moſt Religiouſly obſerved about the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> ſhe thought the beſt
way was to let them enter into diſcourſe, and when they were moſt earneſt and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
unto each other, then ſhe to ſteal away unſeen. Then peeping through the
Buſh, ſhe ſaw them ſitting in a round figure, and that they whoſe faces were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, were Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, which were not altogether unknown
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53527:147"/>
unto her, having formerly ſeen them at their general Solemnities and Sacrifices.
Then ſhe began to wonder more why they ſhould come directly to that place, and
ſtay there as if it was upon ſome premeditated deſign; at laſt ſhe heard one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
amongſt them, begin thus: Oh <hi>Delphire,</hi> you are a moſt partial and ſevere
Judge, in condemning a perſon without ever hearing what he can ſay for himſelf. I
ſee <hi>Thaumantes</hi> (anſwered the Shepherdeſs) that you take more pains in pumping
for excuſes and gloſſes unto your falſe reaſons, then I have done to convince and
prove them falſe: If the Gods, replied the Shepherd, had ſeen your ſoul unbyaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and fit to judge the difference betwixt us, they would not have appointed us to
come and look for a Judge in this place. The Gods, replied the Shepherdeſs, are
pleaſed that the laudable actions of men ſhould be divulged and recompenced, and
likewiſe their faults made publique and puniſhed. If puniſhments and recompences
(replied he) be to be expected from their hands. Oh <hi>Delphire,</hi> I begin to pitty
you, for you are never able to endure the puniſhments that are due unto your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty:
and I know not how my heart, which is ſo much unaccuſtomed unto any hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
will be able to receive that bliſs and reward of my fidelity and affection. If
we do meet with a juſt Judge, anſwered the Shepherdeſs and ſmiled, I believe you
will not ſo much pity as envy me: But <hi>Thaumantes,</hi> let us leave off this diſcourſe, I
ſee you uſe it only to pleaſe ſome that are in the company, but aſſure your ſelf, there
is none that has a ſound judgment will approve of it. I know, replied the Shepherd,
that nothing angers a perſon who is in the wrong, more, then to hear that ſtring
touched upon, becauſe it puts them in mind of the injury they do: but he that has
Juſtice on his ſide, cannot be ſilent at the injuſtice which is done him: yet ſince you
command me to be ſilent, I will obey; yet I hope you will give me leave to ſing: ſo
not ſtaying for her anſwer, and having a very good voice, he began to ſing a very
invective and bitter ſong, which upbraided her with cruelty and injuſtice. As ſoon
as he had done, <hi>Delphire</hi> ſaid unto him; there needs no other teſtimony of your
change then this which you have given me, in contemning my commands which
formerly, for your life your durſt not have done: for ſinging and ſpeaking are crimes
alike, if what is forbidden be pronounced. The Shepherd anſwered not a word,
but ſhrugged his ſhoulders and made a ſign that his tongue was tyed: and this gave
occaſion unto another Shepherd in the company, to ſpeak for him: This, ſaid he,
is exceſſe of cruelty; and very hard that a man may not ſo much as complain of his
torment. That I muſt confeſs is very hard, anſwered the Shepherdeſs, but you
muſt alſo confeſs with me on the other ſide, that to hear a man baul and keep a coyl
when he has no cauſe, is exceſſe of patience. But I beſeech you, replied he, if you
will not ſuffer <hi>Thaumantes</hi> to ſpeak, upon what deſign did you come unto this place?
We came hither, replied ſhe, not to diſpute and wrangle as we have done, but to
ſee if we could find that Judg which the Oracle has promiſed we ſhould. Are you
ſure replied he, that this is the place where you are to expect this Judge: No que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but it is, anſwered <hi>Delphire,</hi> for it is named, and we are told that this is the
place where <hi>Celadon</hi> fell into the water. There is not one in all the neighbour-hood,
who does not know it as a place obſervable for ſeveral diſaſterous accidents: and
as for our Judge, we cannot be miſtaken: for the Oracle is this:</p>
                     <lg type="poem">
                        <head>The Oracle.</head>
                        <l>WHere <hi>Celadon</hi> they ſay did find a grave,</l>
                        <l>There you, a juſt and prudent judge ſhall have,</l>
                        <l>Who though unſeen ſhall ſee you, and ſhall hear</l>
                        <l>Your difference, and do you right, ne'er fear.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>This, replied the Shepherd, is an Oracle very obſcure; for if you do not ſee the
party who is to be your Judge, how ſhould you ever know who he is: Nay more,
ſaid <hi>Delphire,</hi> the Oracle ſays, he ſhall hear us though we do not ſee him: but
certain it is, it muſt be ſo, for the Gods have ſaid it, and we are bound upon pain of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53527:147"/>
diſobedience to believe it, and therefore we muſt expect he will make it manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us. But I beſeech you ſaid the Shepherd, how ſhould this Judge hear the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
ſince he is not here? And how ſhould you tell it unto him? Theſe difficulties
(anſwered <hi>Delphire</hi>) muſt be reſolved by the God that gave the Oracle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diana</hi> who was all the while behind the Buſh, heard all this diſcourſe; and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through the leaves, ſhe knew all the Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, though
ſhe had no great familiarity with them; for they were neighbours, and dwelt upon
the banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> towards the Mountains of <hi>Rochfort</hi> and <hi>Chevieres:</hi> and ſhe had
often ſeen them at the publique Sacrifices of Miſleto, and other aſſemblies: ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
alſo the high eſteem which every one had of the beauty of <hi>Delphire,</hi> and
merit of <hi>Thaumantes,</hi> and ſo was not altogether ignorant of the amity that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, becauſe they did not offer to hide their affections. But ſeeing now
ſuch a divorce betwixt them, ſhe could not chuſe but wonder, and yet her wonder
ceaſed, when ſhe conſidered what occaſion ſhe had to complain againſt <hi>Sylvander.</hi>
When ſhe heard the Oracle, ſhe concluded that certainly it was ſhe whom the Gods
had choſen to be their Judge, at which ſhe was much diſpleaſed; for the ill humour
ſhe was in, made her deſirous to ſhun all company, even of her own companions.
Thus ſeeing her ſelf forced to ſtay all the morning, and to hear their difference,
though it went againſt her mind, yet ſhe reſolved to obey what the Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Therefore ſhe reſolved to take little truce with her ſorrows, and ſhew her
ſelf, and take upon her the office of their Judge, but to defer her judgement until
the next day, hoping that in time ſhe ſhould overcome her paſſion, and put her
mind in better order. In order therefore unto this reſolve, ſhe ſpoke in a loud
voice theſe words: Trouble your ſelves no further, Oh <hi>Delphire,</hi> and <hi>Thaumantes;</hi>
for here is your Judge, whom the Heavens have ordained to determine your diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
upon this, riſing from behind the Buſh, and ſtriving to ſhew a well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
countenance, ſhe went unto them, who were all in ſuch an amazement, that
they ſtood like ſo many Statues: but when they had looked well upon her, and knew
her to be <hi>Diana,</hi> they broke out into an univerſal joy: for there was not one of all
the company, who did not know the virtue and merit of that Shepherdeſs: and
<hi>Thaumantes</hi> was ſo over joyed to ſee ſuch a Judge, as he fell down upon his knees,
and offered to kiſs her hand; but <hi>Diana</hi> would not permit him, yet ſaluted him, and
went toward <hi>Delphire,</hi> who imbraced her as heartily as <hi>Thaumantes,</hi> who ſeeing it
and ſeeming to be very envious at it: I am afraid (ſaid he in a loud voice) ſhe will
be as partial in her judgement, as ſhe is in her careſſes. <hi>Diana</hi> hearing this, ſmiled
and ſaid; Do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ear, for I will ballance every thing according to equity, and
render unto each one what is due. It is the cuſtom of thoſe (ſaid <hi>Delphire</hi>) who
have a bad cauſe, to ſuſpect the judgement of the moſt juſt perſons, and corrupt
it if they can by their impoſtures: But <hi>Thaumantes,</hi> thoſe favours which I receive
from this fair Shepherdeſs, are no more due unto me then unto you; and know,
that whatſoever is freely given out of meer liberality, cannot be claimed as a debt
due, and therefore you are to blame in asking any part or ſhare in thoſe favours ſhe
is pleaſed to confer upon me, ſince neither you nor I can pretend unto them as due.
To which <hi>Thaumantes</hi> anſwered, it is no wonder, Fair <hi>Delphire,</hi> that he who has ſo
often troubled you with his angry queſtions, ſhould continue to ask them, ſince he
has got a habit of them: and it is no wonder, anſwered ſhe, that you be denied now,
ſince you have been ſo accuſtomed unto it.</p>
                     <p>Their diſcourſe had continued longer, if the reſt of the Shepherds and Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes
in ſaluting <hi>Diana,</hi> had not interrupted them. But when they had all done,
<hi>Delphire</hi> began again; Fair and diſcreet Shepherdeſs, ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Diana,</hi> I have
often heard ſay, that the Graces are never painted alone; to intimate unto us, that
the party who confers one, will immediately ſecond it with another; or perhaps that
the party who receives one, may be encouraged to ask more: if it be ſo, then this
Shepherd and I may hope that by what favours you have done unto us, you will add
more, which we do moſt humbly beg at your hands. Sweet <hi>Delphire,</hi> anſwered
<hi>Diana,</hi> it were a great diſcourteſie to deny any thing which ſo fair and ſo diſcreet a
Shepherdeſs as you are, ſhall ask; and therefore you may aſſure your ſelf of any
thing within the compaſs of my power. The Gods (ſaid <hi>Thaumantes</hi>) are not like
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53527:148"/>
unto men, for men may give and beſtow Offices as they pleaſe, but they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
capacity to exerciſe them; But when the Gods do give any thing, they give with
it all that is requiſite and neceſſary unto it; And therefore, ſince it hath pleaſed the
Gods to make choice of you, fair <hi>Diana,</hi> to compoſe all thoſe diſtempers which
have fallen out betwixt us, and which without you can never be reconciled, it is not
to be doubted but that they have endued you with wiſdom, power, and capacity to
effect it. <hi>Thaumantes</hi> (anſwered <hi>Diana</hi>) If I had been asked who I thought lived
together in moſt tranquility and contentment, I ſhould have anſwered <hi>Delphire</hi> and
<hi>Thaumantes;</hi> and I do exceedingly wonder to hear you ſay that you ſeek for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilements
and compoſures; But ſince it is ſo, and ſince the Gods have made
choice of me to that end, I will obey them in the execution of their Ordinances, and
as their Inſtrument, who though of my ſelf leſs capable, yet by their aſſiſtance, may
render them the glory that is due unto them. Every one (replied <hi>Delphire</hi>) are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
as you are, in their opinions of this Shepherds and my happineſs, but ſince
you are pleaſed to undertake the office of our Judge, we beſeech you to hear what
we can ſay for our ſelves, and by your wiſdom and judgement recover us out of that
gulf of diſcontent and inquietude wherein we are plunged. That which you do ask
as a favour, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I do think my ſelf obliged to pay as a due debt, as being
enjoyned unto it by the Ordinance of the Gods, and prompted by mine own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
inclination to ſerve you: But I ſhall deſire one favour from you both, which
if granted, I ſhall take as a very great one; which is, that you will defer the whole
buſineſs until to morrow, at the ſame hour and place; for I am obliged to do a piece
of ſervice unto a very dear friend, which cannot be delayed without much prejudice
and inconvenience unto her. Unto which <hi>Delphire</hi> replied, Fair and Diſcreet Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs,
we are obliged unto whatſoever you ſhall deſire or command, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you may take that leave which out of your ſweetneſs you are pleaſed to ask of
us, for you have a moſt full and abſolute authority over us. Since you are ſo well
contented, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> I will go unto the place where neceſſity calls me unto,
being very ſorry to part from ſuch good company, and promiſing to be here to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
at this place, and about this time: Upon this ſhe took her leave of them, and
went away as faſt as ſhe could, to ſhew that her buſineſs was urgent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phillis</hi> on the other ſide not finding her at home, ſhe went to ſeek her in ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as ſhe uſed moſt to drive her Flock: But as Fortune was, ſhe made choice of a
place more retired that day, purpoſely becauſe ſhe deſired not to be ſeen by any:
ſo that <hi>Phillis,</hi> after ſhe had ſought for her in ſeveral places, ſhe came at laſt to the
great Meddow, and at the one end of it ſhe eſpied ſome Shepherdeſſes, amongſt
whom ſhe thought ſhe ſaw <hi>Diana,</hi> but when ſhe was come neerer, ſhe found her
ſelf miſtaken; and that they were the three ſtrangers, who came from the coaſts of
<hi>Arar,</hi> I mean <hi>Florice, Cercinea,</hi> and <hi>Palinice:</hi> And becauſe ſhe ſaw them talking
very affectionately unto each other, and would not tell any the cauſe of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into this Country, ſhe thought that perhaps ſhe ſhould learn ſomthing if unſeen
ſhe could hear what they ſaid. This curioſity cauſed her to creep from Buſh to Buſh,
till ſhe came ſo neer, that ſhe could hear <hi>Florice</hi> ſay, The truth is, I begin to doubt
that the Oracle which cauſed us to come into this Country of Forreſts, will either
deceive us, or elſe thoſe that did interpret it unto us are themſelves deceived: for
we have been ſo long here to no purpoſe, that it ſeems the Gods have either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
us, or elſe laugh at us for underſtanding them no better. For my part, ſaid
<hi>Cercinea,</hi> I am the youngeſt, and ſubmitted my ſelf to the conduct of you both; if
I have failed, the fault is <hi>Palinices,</hi> unto whom I wholly referred my ſelf; ſo as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diving into any deep myſteries, I underſtood the Oracle as ſhe did interpret it
unto me. I am ſure anſwered <hi>Palinice,</hi> that I did not deceive either of you; for
you heard the Oracle which we received from the Temple of <hi>Venus:</hi> and as for the
interpretation of it, I did not lye in a ſillable, but told you truly, as the old <hi>Druide</hi>
told me. Since it is ſo replyed <hi>Cercinea,</hi> we muſt not make too much haſte away,
and though the time be long, yet it is no longer here then upon the Banks of <hi>Arar,</hi>
for the ſweet converſation of the diſcreet Shepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon,</hi> is as pleaſing as
any company we can find in any other place. I muſt confeſs, ſaid <hi>Florice,</hi> that the
company of <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> is very ſweet and pleaſing, and that here is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53527:148"/>
many pretty innocent paſtimes which are ſutable unto their honeſt ſimplicity: but I
muſt tell you, that they are fitter for ſuch inferiour ſpirits as theirs are, then for us,
who are accuſtomed unto a higher and more noble ſtrain; and to tell you truly, this
kind of life begins to be very irkſome unto me, ſo as if I ſtay here a little longer, I
ſhall throw away my Sheep-hook and my Scrip. I know not why you ſhould ſo
much diſlike it (replied <hi>Cercinea</hi>) but me-thinks there is nothing in Cities which
equals the liberty and freedom of theſe Villages. Here (ſaid <hi>Florice</hi>) is nothing to
be ſeen but Sheep and Hares, and Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes. Tell me no more
of Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, anſwered <hi>Cercinea,</hi> but find me out ſuch another
Wit as <hi>Sylvander</hi>'s amongſt all your great Cities and Towns; or a Woman compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
unto either <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> or <hi>Phillis,</hi> either in beauty, wit, or diſcretion: I
mention none of the reſt, bur do admire their civility and ſweet converſation; and
I do abominate all the conſtraints, tricks, and diſſimulations of Cities. I ſee (ſaid
<hi>Florice</hi>) that you are like thoſe Sorcerers, who having uſed ſome charm upon the
skin of a Wolf, do no ſooner put it upon them, but they preſently participate of
their nature; for this habit of a Shepherd which you wear, has infuſed the wit and
courage of a Shepherdeſs into you: But well <hi>Cercinea,</hi> be you a Shepherdeſs as
long as you pleaſe; but for my part, I deſire to be amongſt thoſe of my own qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and in my own Country: For to tell you truly, I am moſt delighted in ſeeing a
Cavalier bravely Arm'd and Mounted, and breaking his Lance handſomly: But what
pitiful ſport is it to ſee two Shepherds run for a Garland of Field-Flowers? To be
ſhort, the Purple and Scarlet pleaſeth my eye better then the Ruſſet and Gray; Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
is ſofter then Wool; and I love to be amongſt my equals. Unto ſuch as ayme
at their contentment, ſaid <hi>Cercinea,</hi> Grandeur, and ſuch vanities as you ſpeak of,
are not the way unto it: and ſuch as conſider things as indeed they are, not embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
ſhaddows for ſubſtances, will moſt certainly condemn them; the gliſter of gold,
and ſilver, and purple, which dazles ſo much the eye, are not half ſo pleaſing as a
green Field diapred with Flowers; What needs the Body more then ſuch a cover as
will defend it from the injury of wind and weather? Provided ſuch a Suit be fit and
handſomly made, it is better then all the gaudery of Gold, which does but beguil the
eys of thoſe who are not able to look what is in the inſide of ſuch a Suit: As for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
between the feats of Chivalry, and the harmleſs exerciſes of Shepherds, it muſt
needs be confeſſed the one is all blood, violence, injury and murder, and the other is
all innocency, and gives no offence unto any; the one comes near the nature of
Bears, Tigers, and Lions, and the other of men: And as for the reproach which
you put upon me for loving the habit of Shepherdeſſes, I ſay that I wiſh I were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from all thoſe turbulencies and cares which does torment thoſe that do live in
your perpetual confuſion.</p>
                     <p>She would have continued on, if <hi>Palinice</hi> had not interrupted; It is not our
buſineſs (ſaid ſhe) to diſpute which of theſe two Lives is the happier, but whether
we ſhould ſtay any longer here to ſee the fulfilling of the Oracle which ſent us hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I conceive it good for us to peruſe it again, and conſider ſeriouſly upon the
words of it: Upon this ſhe put her hand into her Scrip, and pulled out a paper, in
which ſhe read theſe words.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Phillis</hi> who till now never knew the cauſe of their voyage, ſhe was very glad
that ſhe had found it out, even when ſhe leaſt thought upon it; for finding them to
be very diſcreet and virtuous, ſhe and her companions were exceeding deſirous of
it; not only out of a common curioſity, but a will to do them ſervice: And this
had been impoſſible to diſcover otherwiſe, becauſe theſe ſtrangers in obedience to
the Oracle durſt not reveal it unto any. But <hi>Phillis</hi> having found it out, ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
to remember the Oracle, which ſhe had never done, unleſs <hi>Circenea</hi> and <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
had repeated it ſeveral times, For my part (ſaid <hi>Palanice</hi>) I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that we ought to ſtay here yet a while longer, ſince it is certain that the <hi>Druide</hi>
told us, <hi>Forreſts</hi> was the place where we ſhould meet with our ſatisfaction, and that
our happineſs muſt proceed from three perſons, of which, two are hard to be found
out; but the goodneſs of God is great, ſince that which muſt inſtruct us, is ſo cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expreſſed that we cannot miſtake: for (ſaid ſhe, and I obſerve it in the words)
when you ſhall find a perſon who ſhall tell you that God hath appointed you by his
Oracle, that a living dead man ſhall be your Phiſitian and Medicine, with a perſon
unto whom they ſhall againſt her will reſtore a happineſs, which ſhe did loſe with her
will. One of you three upon which the Lot ſhall fall, muſt relate unto her the pain
which you endure, and ſhe will appoint you what ſhe conceives beſt for you. The
worſt of all this, is (anſwered <hi>Florice</hi>) the loſs of time which will ſeem very tedious.
<hi>Circenea</hi> anſwered and ſmiled, that no happineſs is attained without pains. Your
happineſſe is compleated, replied <hi>Florice,</hi> for you are of a more Shepherdiſh humour,
then the Shepherdeſſes themſelves. I have often heard you ſay (anſwered <hi>Circenea</hi>)
that it is great wiſdom to be pleaſed with any thing that neceſſity makes inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe Shepherdeſſes were thus diſputing amongſt themſelves, <hi>Phillis</hi> who
had learned as much as ſhe deſired to know, did think it beſt to ſteal off unſeen; and
therefore when ſhe ſaw them moſt eager in their conteſts, ſhe crept away, and went
to ſeek <hi>Diana,</hi> who on her ſide was not a little perplexed; for as ſhe deſigned to
ſeparate her ſelf from all converſation, Fortune would have it ſo, that which way
ſoever ſhe went, ſhe met with ſeveral encounters; for having quitted her ſelf of
<hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Thaumantes,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe was out of their ſight, looking for the
moſt unfrequented place of all the Wood, ſhe had no ſooner ſeated her ſelf under a
ſhady thicket, but ſhe heard a ſtranger ſing very neer her, ſinging, and the effect of
the ſong was, <hi>That men are without any amity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Diana</hi> heard this voice, ſhe had a good mind to go and ſee who it was,
but hearing her begin to talk unto her ſelf, ſhe thought it beſt to hear what ſhe ſaid;
and ſhe heard her ſay thus: What a hard and ſevere thing it is which Nature hath
impoſed upon Women, that they muſt not only live amongſt their enemies, but
alſo be ſubject unto their Tyrannical Dominion? Had ſhe but put a little more
ſtrength into our body, we had not been ſubject unto that proud and fierce animal,
called Man: but why did ſhe not as well ſubject this man, unto an Ox or an Horſe,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53527:149"/>
which are ſtronger then he, as he is ſtronger then us? For if weakneſs be the cauſe
of our ſubjection, why ſhould not they be ſubject unto them? Nay, upon the ſame
reaſon, why ſhould not the weakneſs of their minds ſubject them unto our bodies?
For the ſtrength of their judgements cannot be equal unto the ſtrength of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Is it not an infallible argument of a weak judgement, to deſire a thing moſt
paſſionately, and mediately not to deſire it? Which is he amongſt men, that has
not deceived her that truſted in him? Shew me the man, who makes it a matter of
conſcience to keep his word, his promiſes, nay his very oaths and execrations, when
he intends to deceive? They think their diſloyalty is handſomly covered, when they
ſay, that the Gods will not puniſh the oaths of perjured Lovers: It is true indeed,
they do not puniſh them immediately upon the very act, but yet they defer it only,
becauſe they will puniſh them according to their merits altogether: there is not a
man breathing upon the face of the earth, that does not ſwear and proteſt, and vow,
and yet his intention is quite contrary: their deſignes are meer Chimeras, empty
clouds; one is no ſooner begun, but another ſeconds it, and quite obliterates the
firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their promiſes and their oaths reſemble great claps of thunder, whoſe noiſe
is no ſooner ended, but no more is heard of it: what God is there whom they will
not call to witneſs? What curſe will they not call for upon themſelves? And what
aſſurance will they not give, when they would obtain any thing of us? But when the
humour of it is paſt, or when they have obtained what they deſire, who cares for
any performances of promiſe, or fears any curſes they called upon themſelves? But
preſently ſeek out for excuſes to avoid thoſe chaſtiſements which they deſerve: they
are the very Peſts of the earth, the moſt imperfect works of the Gods, ſent only for
our puniſhments and eternal torment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diana,</hi> who heard every ſillable that this Shepherdeſs ſpoke, and thought all allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſhe approved of all ſhe ſaid, and going to her with a deſire to
ſee her face, ſhe could not tread ſo ſoftly, but ſhe made ſuch a noiſe, that the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
heard her; who thinking at the firſt that it was ſome man, out of a hatred unto
the very name, ſhe would have gone away: but afterwards perceiving it was a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs,
ſhe ſtayed, but looked about her with ſuch an affrighted countenance, and
wild eye, as teſtified, the words of her mouth proceeded from her heart. <hi>Diana</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her in this condition, and thinking her aſtoniſhment proceeded from the ſame
cauſe that her own perplexities did, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he began to pity her; and ſaluting her with
a kind aſpect, offered all the aſſiſtance and ſervice ſhe was able. The ſtranger ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſo fair and full of curteſie, began to leave her affrighted and wild looks, and
aſſume her ordinary countenance and temper. After ſhe had ſaluted <hi>Diana,</hi> and
thanked her for her courteous offers, ſhe anſwered thus; I am very willing and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
Fair Shepherdeſs, to render the ſame ſervices unto you, which you out of
your goodneſs are pleaſed to offer unto me, and wiſh with all my heart, I were
able to ſecond my deſires with real performances, as your civility does oblige me;
but as the caſe is with me, I muſt now be all upon the craving ſide, and not only beg
your aſſiſtance, but alſo that remedy, which by the appointment of the Gods, I
come to look for in this Country. Aſſure your ſelf, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> that you will
find none here who will not be very ready to do you any ſervice: but I believe you
will not find any here ſo vain as to think themſelves able to Counſel others, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
ſimplicity of our words will not permit ſo much arrogance to be amongſt us:
Yet two things, replied the ſtranger, makes me hope well in my voyage; the one,
that the Gods are no lyars, nor breakers of their promiſes, but have left that quality
unto men: The other is, becauſe my firſt encounter in this Country, is a very good
omen that I ſhall find what I look for: your beauty, your civility, and your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
expreſſions makes me hope for a happy ſucceſs in my voyage. The Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> are no lyars nor deceivers, but ſometimes they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to render their Oracles ſo full of obſcurity, that men do often miſtake and deceive
themſelves in the interpretation: as for any thing that relates unto me, I wiſh fair
Shepherdeſs that the meeting may prove as ſerviceable unto you, as it is pleaſing
unto me, and as I deſire to ſerve you. If there be any thing in this Country which
you think conducible unto your contentment, I beſeech you, tell it unto me; and
if without prejudice to your ſelf you may, tell me what occaſion brought you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53527:150"/>
and what reaſon you have to enveigh ſo much againſt men? Upon this the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſtood mute a while, and looked upon the ground; at the laſt, lifting up her head
with a ſad ſih, ſhe returned this anſwer: The queſtion which you ask, Fair Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs,
is ſo reaſonable, that I will very willingly give you ſatisfaction; knowing
very well that the patient muſt diſcover his diſeaſe unto that Phiſitian from whom he
deſires a remedy; but before I trouble you with a hearing of it, I beſeech you ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
my curioſity, and tell me whether you be not either <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> or <hi>Diana;</hi> for one
of my greateſt inducements unto the voyage, was my hopes of ſo much happineſs,
as to be acquainted with thoſe two Shepherdeſſes, as well by ſight, as by thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
which Fame gives of them. There may be many Shepherdeſſes in this Country
(anſwered <hi>Diana</hi> bluſhing) whoſe names may be <hi>Diana,</hi> and perhaps ſome one of
them more favoured by the Heavens above the reſt; ſo as the name of <hi>Diana</hi> which I
do bear, cannot make me believe my ſelf the ſame you ſpeak of, ſince Fame has no
ground of any reports from me: but ſuch as I am, I will not deny the name, of
which you have ſo good an opinion, and wiſh I were able, as I am willing to do you
any ſuch ſervice as might make you continue here. Are you (ſaid the ſtranger) the
companion of <hi>Aſtrea?</hi> I am, replied <hi>Diana;</hi> Then (ſaid the ſtranger) there are no
more <hi>Dianas</hi> in this Country whom I deſire to know: it is you only and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
who have filled me ſo full of curioſity, and made me more willingly come
into this Country, though the Gods did adviſe me unto it by their Oracle: upon
this ſhe ſaluted her with ſuch demonſtrations of good will, that <hi>Diana</hi> was obliged
unto the like.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame inſtant, <hi>Phillis,</hi> who had been looking for <hi>Diana</hi> in all places where
there was any probability of finding her, ſaw them thus ſaluting and careſſing each
other, and therefore ſhe made the more haſte towards them. The ſtranger ſeeing
her coming, and being very deſirous to ſee <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſhe ſhewed her unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and
asked her whether that was her Companion? She is my Companion (anſwered
<hi>Diana</hi>) but I believe, not that Companion whom you deſire to ſee, for the name
of this is <hi>Phillis;</hi> and though perhaps ſhe muſt yeild unto the other in point of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
yet I aſſure you, there is not one in all the Country that exceeds her in diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and virtue. I make no queſtion of it (anſwered the ſtranger) ſince ſhe is your
Companion: Indeed ſhe is, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> and the deareſt Companion that <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
and I have, and ſuch a one, as when you know her, you will think worthy of Love
and eſteem. Upon this, <hi>Phillis</hi> was come unto them, and broke off their diſcourſe,
and <hi>Diana</hi> going to her, Siſter ſaid ſhe unto her, make much of this ſtranger, and for
my ſake Love her, ſince ſhe is come to encreaſe the number of the Shepherdeſſes of
<hi>Lignon. Phillis,</hi> as well to anſwer the deſires of her Companion, as in obſervance
to the Laws of the Country, ſhe preſently advanced towards her, and the ſtranger
did the like, infinitely ſatisfied with the kind entertainment of theſe Shepherdeſſes,
whoſe ſweet civility ſhe could not ſufficiently admire, thinking that they did much
ſurpaſs all the reports that Fame had trumpetted in their praiſe.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Diana,</hi> though ſhe made no ſhew of it, yet, was her ſoul full of perplexity,
by reaſon of <hi>Sylvander;</hi> and the conſtraint wherein ſhe was ſince ſhe met with
this ſtranger, ſeemed intollerable to be endured any longer: and therefore ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
as ſoon as ſhe had learned the cauſe of her coming into this Country, to
leave her: Siſter, ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> This fair ſtranger is come into the Country
to find a remedy againſt a diſpleaſure which preſſeth her; and becauſe ſhe merits the
ſervice of us all, I ſhall deſire her, ſince you are come, to acquaint us with the cauſe
of her voyage, that we may be better enabled to do her that ſervice which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
and ſhe deſerves. <hi>Phillis</hi> on the contrary, who was not willing to loſe ſo much
time as to hear this diſcourſe, ſhe anſwered thus: I muſt confeſs Siſter, that you have
great reaſon for your deſire, but me-thinks we ſhould much wrong our companion,
if we do not anſwer her expectation of our company; and therefore I conceive it
beſt to defer it until ſuch time as <hi>Aſtrea</hi> may be preſent. <hi>Diana</hi> did quickly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the reaſon which cauſed <hi>Phillis</hi> to ſay ſo, and approving of it, they all went
together towards the great Walk; into which, as ſoon as they entred, they ſaw
<hi>Florice, Cercenea,</hi> and <hi>Palinice</hi> very near them; who having long debated upon
the ſubject which <hi>Phillis</hi> overheard, they came thither to paſs away their time, till
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53527:150"/>
the reſt of the Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes aſſembled according to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</p>
                     <p>When the ſtranger firſt ſaw them, ſhe knew them not, nor ever imagined that
they were in this Country, alſo their habits of Shepherdeſſes did ſo diſguiſe them,
that ſhe might very well miſtake them; and when they came nearer, ſhe knew them
by their voices, and not by their viſages: I am either extreamly deceived (ſaid ſhe in a
great amazement) or elſe I do ſee my dear friends. <hi>Florice</hi> then and her two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
looking upon her, and hearing her ſpeak, they knew her; they went unto
her, and embraced her with ſuch extream joy, as made it manifeſt that people love
one another better when they meet in a ſtrange Country, then when they are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their own: For they had not ſo much patience as to embrace her one after
another, but fell upon her all at once; one kiſſed her lips, another her cheek, and
a third graſped her hand, with ſuch demonſtrations of good will, as perhaps never
paſſed amongſt them when they met upon the Banks of <hi>Arar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phillis</hi> who ſaw all theſe great careſſes, and was half weary of this company; Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
(ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Diana</hi> in a low voice) had we not beſt leave this ſtranger amongſt
her acquaintance? For I am afraid <hi>Aſtrea</hi> will not like we ſhould carry her unto her,
before we have given her notice, as well in reſpect of <hi>Alexis,</hi> as becauſe you know
ſhe will be in the habit of the <hi>Druide.</hi> Siſter, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> I am of your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and am very glad that theſe other ſtrangers come in to relieve us; for otherwiſe
I know not how we ſhould have been rid of her.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt they were thus talking, <hi>Florice</hi> and her companions could not ſufficiently
ſatisfie themſelves with careſſing their companion, and had not ceaſed ſo ſoon, but
for <hi>Phillis,</hi> who addreſſing her ſelf unto them; Fair Shepherdeſſes, ſaid ſhe unto
them, ſince my companion and I do ſee there is ſo much intimacy and affection
amongſt you, we will not be any cauſe of ſeparating you; and therefore, ſince we
muſt needs go and wait upon the <hi>Druide,</hi> who (as you know) ſtays at the houſe of
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> for the love of us, we cannot leave this fair ſtranger in better company then
ſhe has met withal: And therefore, ſaid ſhe unto the ſtranger, I beſeech you give
us leave to pay our duties, and we promiſe that ere it be long we will wait upon you
unto <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Fair and wiſe Shepherdeſſes (ſaid ſhe) ſince it is your pleaſure I
ſhould ſtay with my dear friends whom I have met withal, I will willingly do ſo: but
upon condition you will be as good as you promiſe, in making me known unto the
Fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and in the mean time aſſure her, that you have met with one who with
all her ſoul deſires the happineſſes of her Love. All this (anſwered <hi>Diana</hi>) we do
faithfully promiſe, and more, we promiſe to do any thing elſe which may conduce
unto your real ſervice.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Phillis</hi> thought it expedient to engage <hi>Florice, Cercinea,</hi> and
<hi>Palinice,</hi> leſt their impatience ſhould make them depart the Country too ſoon; and
therefore when ſhe ſaw that <hi>Diana</hi> had taken her leave of the company: Siſter (ſaid
ſhe unto her in a loud voice) I beſeech you ſtay a little for me, and I will wait upon
you preſently, for I muſt needs talk a little with theſe three fair Shepherdeſſes. Siſter,
anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> what haſte ſoever I have, yet I will ſtay for you, and therefore ſay
what you pleaſe unto them. Then <hi>Phillis</hi> addreſſing her ſelf unto theſe three ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<hi>Florice</hi> (ſaid ſhe, in a low and grave countenance, otherwiſe then ſhe uſed) and
you <hi>Cercinea</hi> and <hi>Palinice,</hi> The Gods do let you know by me, that which they have
already ſpoken unto you by their Oracle, how that one who was dead, and yet lives, is
to be your medicine, and likewiſe another unto whom is rendred againſt her Will, a
benefit which ſhe loſt with her Will. O ye Gods! cryed they all out, and clapped their
hands together, oh bleſſed Shepherdeſs, whom the heavens have ordained for our
happineſs and contentment, may you for ever find the accompliſhment of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
as we have of ours in meeting with you: Then gazing upon one another, Is
it not moſt certain (ſaid they) that the Gods are no Deceivers, but will at the laſt
moſt infallibly perform all their promiſes? Upon this, all three ſaluted <hi>Phillis</hi> with
ſo many expreſſions of joy, that <hi>Diana,</hi> and the other ſtranger who knew not the
cauſe of their coming, ſtood amazed: But <hi>Phillis</hi> who continued her grave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
after ſhe had returned their ſalute; Now, ſaid ſhe, I cannot ſtay with you
any longer; the time is not yet come that your pain muſt have an end, but it will be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53527:151"/>
very ſhortly: content your ſelves therefore with this, that the Gods have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
what they told you by their Oracle, but will in fit time and place accompliſh
it. <hi>Florice</hi> then began to ſpeak; now (ſaid ſhe) we know unto whom the Gods
have committed the care of us, we will with all contentment wait as long as you ſhall
pleaſe; aſſuring you ſage Shepherdeſs, that we are infinitely pleaſed with the choiſe
which the Gods have made of you. <hi>Diand</hi> and the other ſtranger was very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
unto their diſcourſe, but not underſtanding it, <hi>Diana</hi> asked <hi>Phillis,</hi> what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
this was which they ſpoke off. The Gods, anſwered <hi>Phillis</hi> have ſent
theſe three ſtrangers into the Country to receive a remedy unto ſome perplexities
which troubles them, and by their Oracle have forbidden them to ſpeak of it unto
any, but unto that perſon who ſhall repeat the anſwer which they received from the
Oracle. Now I have repeated it unto them, and more, I do aſſure them, that they
ſhall receive all manner of ſatisfaction and contentment. As <hi>Diana</hi> was aſtoniſhed
at the firſt, ſo was ſhe much more, when ſhe heard theſe words, for ſhe could not
imagine how her Companion ſhould come to the knowledg of this Oracle. But
<hi>Phillis</hi> counterfeiting admirably well, that it was by divine inſpiration; after ſome
other ſuch diſcourſe, ſhe took her leave of them; aſſuring them, that ere long they
ſhould find eaſe and ſatisfaction to their minds: and by the way, ſhe related unto
<hi>Diana</hi> how as ſhe was ſeeking her, ſhe met with them, and unſeen of them, heard
them repeat and diſcourſe upon this Oracle.</p>
                     <p>Thus they went talking upon this encounter, till they came to the houſe of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
but finding her no further dreſt, then when they left her; Oh Siſter (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> and
ſeemed to wonder) what, not farther yet? Do I find you juſt as I left you? It is to
ſhew (anſwered <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) that I am no changeling. Nay, nay, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> my
meaning is, you are dreſt no more then you were when I went to ſeek <hi>Diana:</hi> Pray
what have you been doing all the while? Certainly Siſter, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you
are very weary, ſince the time ſeems ſo long unto you: I aſſure you I thought you
but newly parted: It ſeems quite contrary with you, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> and that you
have been ſo pleaſed, that hours ſeem but minutes unto you. If contentment and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
can do it, replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I muſt needs confeſs what you ſay: and yet Siſter, do
not think that I have done nothing ſince you went, for in this ſhort time, I have
gotten the Faireſt Miſtris that ever was: And I, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> the ſweeteſt Servant
that ever lived. I warrant you (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>) you have ſpent all this morning about
this piece of work. Siſter (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) you need not ſlight it ſo much; for it is not
a work ſo eaſily done; ſome are whole months and years, nay whole ages about it.
Yes, (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) and for all the haſte which they make, they have time enough to
repent all the dayes of their life: That is a thing (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) which I ſhall never
do, unleſs I repent that I begun it no ſooner: I do believe it, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
your Miſtris is a Woman, but if it were a man, believe it Siſter, you would be
no more exempted then others; and for my part, I ſhall adviſe all thoſe that deſire
to have a quiet life, never to contract amity with any but Women, and to ſhun all
the aſſurances of any good will which Men uſe to make, as a Serpent does the words
of enchantment. I do wonder (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) you ſhould accuſe men of that vice
which they do ſo much charge us with all. Madam, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> did you never
hear the Proverb, <hi>The Debtor demands money;</hi> Men likewiſe do prevent us, and blame
us for that which themſelves are guilty of: believe it, the greateſt ſervitude that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
did impoſe upon us, is in that ſhe conſtrained us to live in their company. Then
(ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi> and ſmiled) how happy are the reſt of our <hi>Druides</hi> who are exempted
from this inconveniency. Doubtleſs they are Madam, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> and you
will know it better, if you will but he pleaſed to conſider what I ſhall ſay unto you;
certainly if men be at any time pleaſing unto thoſe they court, it is when they are
inflamed with Love, and ſeem as if they adored them, for then they are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,
all ſervice, all cares, all ſubmiſſion, all flatteries; briefly their continual
ſtudy is to get the favour of thoſe who hearken unto them: ſo as queſtionleſs if ever
a man be not troubleſome, it is at this time; and yet if we do but well conſider it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
how many inconveniences and troubles do they bring thoſe poor unfortunate
women, whom they have deſigns upon? For if they do not Love them, then
all their cares and courtſhips are ſo many wrongs and injuries unto them: and if
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53527:151"/>
they do Love them, conſider, I beſeech you Madam, how unſupportable they are if
they find entertainment, and how troubleſome they are if they be rejected: they
think one favour to be a ſtep unto another, and never leave till they arrive at
the higheſt: if you reject them, then they are all complaint, reproaches, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaires,
and very often driven unto hatred and revenge: if thou entertain them, they
are ſtill never contented, till they arrive at that which they cannot obtain, without
the ruine of thoſe that give the entertainment; if you do not grant them all that they
deſire, then, the more favours you have done them, the more occaſions have you
given them to ruin you. Then to Crown the work; when they are arrived at the
height of their deſires, you run a hazard either to be ſlighted, or to live in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
inquietude for their inconſtancy. As for thoſe that are repulſed at the firſt; how
infinitely troubleſome they are unto us? What inſupportable torments they are by
their importunities, and ſubtilties? They will hang upon you like a bur; they will
follow you as a ſhaddow does the body; they will never be abſent from you, but
when night comes and ſeparates you from them and all others: you can have no
other object before your eyes but them; and will be ſo troubleſome unto you, that
you will be glad to baniſh from you ſuch company as you love, only to be rid of
them you love not. At the laſt, if their love do die, as they are very ſubject unto
ſuch changes, what is it which their ſpite will not make them belch forth againſt you?
Their calumnies will blaſt the moſt unblameable life that ever lived: the herceſt Tygers
that ever nature created, are not ſo full of revenge as they will be againſt us. So
then it muſt be concluded (ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and interrupted) that men are troubles at
all times, according to <hi>Dianas</hi> Doctrine. For my part (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) I ſhall not
need to fear them, when I am with <hi>Alexis</hi> amongſt the Virgin <hi>Druides</hi> of <hi>Carnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi>
but to tell you truly, I do believe, there are very few men who have not a
tincture of thoſe vices, wherewith <hi>Diana</hi> upbraids them. Theſe few words from
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> did touch <hi>Celadon</hi> ſo to the quick, that he knew not what to ſay, yet leſt he
ſhould give any notice of it, he thought himſelf obliged to ſay ſomething: For my
part, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> I know not what to ſay, for I never made any tryal of theſe
deceivers, and have known ſome changing women: Then turning to <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> Oh
Servant, (ſaid ſhe in a low voice) when we are amongſt the Virgin <hi>Druides,</hi> we
ſhall care but a little for the inconſtancy of theſe wavering men, and we will laugh at
your Companions who do live in that ſervitude. I hope ſo, (anſwered <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) and
I proteſt unto you Miſtris, I do with extream impatience long to ſee the day when
we muſt depart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diana</hi> ſeeing them whiſper, leſt ſhe ſhould interrupt them, did ſtand a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off, but <hi>Phillis</hi> who was of a very pleaſant and gay humour, and knew very
well that <hi>Alexis</hi> would take delight in it, Siſter, (ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Diana</hi>) is not my
prophecy come to paſs? Does not <hi>Aſtrea</hi> who was wont to Love none but <hi>Diana</hi>
and <hi>Phillis,</hi> and who took delight in no company but theirs, does not ſhe I ſay,
diſdain them now? and Loves only this new Shepherdeſs? Whereby you may note,
that men may well accuſe us alſo of levity, and inconſtancy. Ah <hi>Phillis</hi> (anſwered
<hi>Astrea,</hi> and ſmiled) do you not obſerve that I am now no Shepherdeſs? Do
you ſee, how I am become a <hi>Druide?</hi> And do you not know that honours change
manners? But I hope, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that when this <hi>Druide</hi> is gone, who has infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſo much pride into you, then you will return unto your former humility, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you angry Shepherdeſs, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> withhold your revenge upon me till
that time, and then I will not complain of any hurt you can do me: your meaning
is replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that then you will be full of greater diſpleaſures then ours, and
will not value what we can do: that, replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> is not my meaning. Then, ſaid
<hi>Phillis,</hi> do you think us of ſuch good diſpoſitions, that ſeeing you afflicted for others,
we will have no mind to augment your diſpleaſures? But you will deceive your ſelf in
that; for ingratitude is a vice ſo deteſtable, that it turns the ſweeteſt natures into
harſh diſpoſitions, and makes the moſt courteous and kind, become ſurly, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative.
That is not my meaning neither, replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but it is, becauſe you
ſhall not ſee my here after my Fair Miſtris is gone; for I am fully reſolved to follow
her whitherſoever ſhe ſhall go, and ſhe is pleaſed to permit me. Nay, nay, ſaid <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,
Calidon</hi> will never permit that voyage; <hi>Calidon,</hi> anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> has no more
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53527:152"/>
to do with me, then I will have with him: But <hi>Phocion</hi> (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>) will order it
after another manner. The will of Heaven and of my deſtiny, replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the will of men. But I beſeech you, added <hi>Phillis,</hi> has not thoſe friends which
you have here any prevalence with you? I muſt needs confeſs, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that
if any have, it is they, and this conſideration only can make me reſent my diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
but when I think upon thoſe ſorrows, which I have received from the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
River of <hi>Lignon;</hi> I ſhall deſire to be ſo far diſtant from it, as that the memory
of it may be quite extinguiſhed. If that be your deſign (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) then you muſt
reſolve to carry us with you, for you know our affection will never ſuffer us to be
far from you. Should Heaven conſent unto that, replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I ſhould be but
too happy: I hope, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> that Heaven will favour us as well as you, and
deliver us from that ſervitude wherein we live. <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Belinde</hi> (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) will
pronounce an arreſt againſt you: Yes, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi> will no leſs oppoſe
the voyage, unleſs he may have leave to follow <hi>Phillis. Paris</hi> and <hi>Belinde,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Diana,</hi> will never ordain any thing againſt my will, nor againſt the ſervice of
<hi>Tautates;</hi> for both of them are Religious and Wiſe. But if they ſhould, I ſhould be
excuſable in my diſ-obedience to <hi>Belinde,</hi> becauſe I ought to imitate my Mother in
dedicating my ſelf unto the ſame God unto whom ſhe her ſelf is devoted: And as for
<hi>Paris,</hi> I hope that I may diſpleaſe him to exempt my ſelf from all manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures.
This conſideration therefore, need not to hinder you from carrying us
with you. If this conſideration will not hinder, (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> and ſmiled) I have one
that will, which is, a reſolution never to put <hi>Lycidas</hi> unto the trouble of following
me ſo far; for I do not intend to be diſtant from him, farther then the limits of our
Town will extend.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> could not forbear laughing at <hi>Phillis,</hi> which cauſed her to
add further; do not think Siſter, whatſoever I ſay of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> but that I love you as wel
as any Siſter in the world can: but I muſt needs confeſs, that the affection which I
bear unto the Shepherd, is of another kind then that which I bear unto you: were I
as well learned as <hi>Sylvander,</hi> perhaps I ſhould make a better definition of it; but ſo
it is, that I can hardly be deprived of his ſight for any other: I hope you will not
take my freedom in an ill ſence, but rather excuſe it, becauſe lying is not permitted
amongſt us. Siſter, anſwered <hi>Astrea,</hi> I ſhall never be one that will condemn your
humour; but perhaps I ſhall be extreamly ſorry to be ſo far diſtant from you.
Could I divide my ſelf into two parts, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> the one ſhould wait upon
you which way ſoever you went: but ſince that cannot be, I beſeech you, give me
leave to make good my promiſe unto <hi>Lycidas. Diana</hi> then ſmiled and ſaid, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
there is none but my ſelf who will keep the promiſe which we made unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea.</hi>
I ſhall ſupply the place of <hi>Phillis</hi> (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) and perform the office of
amity which that Shepherdeſs hath ſworn unto her. Do not think Madam, replied
<hi>Phillis,</hi> that I will ever fail in my promiſe to her: but ſhe knows very well, that
when we contracted our league of amity unto each other, one condition was, not to
deny any thing that the one ſhould ask of the other; and ſince I ask her pardon if I
do not follow her, ſhe cannot, unleſs ſhe be perjured, deny it. It is very true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and ſighed, nor will I blame you for what you do, no more then
you upbraid me with my paſt miſ-fortune.</p>
                     <p>Their diſcourſe had laſted long, had it not been for <hi>Aſtreas</hi> dreſſing her ſelf: but
<hi>Alexis</hi> being taller then ſhe, and by conſequence her Gown too long for her, <hi>Diana</hi>
and <hi>Phillis</hi> did take it in, by tucking it up ſo handſomly, that it was as fit as if mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
had been taken of her. The <hi>Druide,</hi> on the other ſide thinking that ſhe had
counterfeited ſick long enough, alſo fearing that if ſhe continued in bed, ſhe ſhould
diſcover the defects of her breſts; ſhe reſolved to get up, and walk in the little grove
of Haſles with <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> foreſeeing that otherwiſe if ſhe ſtayed in her chamber, they
two ſhould never be alone, and ſo ſhould be deprived of the pleaſure which ſhe
took in talking with the Shepherdeſs without interruption. In order therefore unto
this deſign, Servant (ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) ſee what an excellent operation your
diſcourſe has had upon my ſickneſs: Since you came hither, I have been as well as I
can wiſh: if therefore you will let me riſe, we will go and walk away the reſt of the
morning in the little Wood: If I have been any Inſtrument of your well being, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53527:152"/>
                        <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I ſhall think my ſelf the happieſt Woman in the world, for I have no
greater ambition then to do you ſervice. Oh Madam, ſaid <hi>Phillis;</hi> we will all thank
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> for being ſo good a Doctor. Indeed, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> I find my ſelf very well,
and if you will give me the Gown which I am to put on, I will dreſs my ſelf and go
with you whither you pleaſe. <hi>Phillis</hi> ran preſently to reach <hi>Aſtreas</hi> Gown, and
helping her to put it on, ſhe was dreſſed preſently: then coming unto the window,
ſhe dreſſed up her head, and tricked up her ſelf ſo, that this diſguiſed <hi>Druide</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be one of the Faireſt Shepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon: Aſtrea</hi> ſeeing her, could not
chuſe but ſay unto <hi>Phillis;</hi> Well <hi>Phillis,</hi> do you think the time I ſpent in getting
ſuch a Fair Miſtris, was not well imployed? Certainly it was, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> and
ſmiled, if you were <hi>Aſtreas</hi> Brother; for it is the cuſtom in this Country, when one
ſpeaks of a Miſtris and Servant, a Shepherd and a Shepherdeſs is to be underſtood.
Oh <hi>Phillis</hi> (anſwered <hi>Diana</hi>) amongſt the Virgin <hi>Druids,</hi> the cuſtome is quite
contrary; and you muſt know, (added <hi>Alexis</hi>) that in the Sacrifices of <hi>Veſta,</hi>
men are not received.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Druide</hi> was dreſt, ſhe took <hi>Aſtrea</hi> by the hand, and led her out;
and the Flocks of <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> being neer the door, <hi>Alexis</hi> would needs drive
them, to ſhew ſhe was not aſhamed of her habit; but to make them believe ſhe was
ignorant in that miſtery, ſhe uſed her Sheephook and talked to the Flock very auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
at which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> could not chuſe but laugh, and <hi>Diana</hi> would needs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to direct and teach her what to do. After they had a while made themſelves
merry at this exerciſe, they walked to the Wood, into which they were no ſooner
entred, but they ſpied upon their left hand, a great company of Shepherds and
Shepherdeſſes, who were walking there in the ſhade: this encounter did a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the two diſguiſed parties, for being not yet grown confident enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they were afraid to be ſeen by any; and therefore they deſired <hi>Diana</hi> and
<hi>Phillis,</hi> to walk towards that company, whilſt they, leſt they ſhould be known, would
take another way: the two good friends according to their deſires, went forward
and came up to the company; who ſeeing them, did advance themſelves to bid
them good morrow. <hi>Diana</hi> having met with <hi>Daphnis</hi> amongſt them, as her ſpecial
and intimate friend; ſhe went to embrace her, and ask her how ſhe had paſſed away
the night. All complements and ſalutations being ended, <hi>Hylas</hi> who was in the
company, and <hi>Corilas</hi> alſo, not being able to be together without ſeveral diſputes,
they continued on the diſcourſe, which they had begun before thoſe two Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes
came unto them. Good <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Corilas,</hi> tell me one thing; when thou
didſt change <hi>Alexis</hi> for <hi>Stella,</hi> at what game didſt thou play? Why, (anſwered
<hi>Hylas</hi>) do you ask me that queſtion? Becauſe I think, replied <hi>Corilas,</hi> that thou
dareſt hardly ſay it was the game of the Faireſt, as thou wert wont to ſay when thou
didſt leave <hi>Phillis</hi> for <hi>Alexis;</hi> for I cannot believe thy eyes ſo bad, but thou muſt
needs ſee, that ſhe whom thou haſt left, is Fairer then ſhe whom thou haſt taken:
Oh thou ignorant novice, in beauty (cryed out <hi>Hylas</hi>) what is it that can be called
Fair, unleſs it pleaſe? I confeſs (ſaid <hi>Corilas</hi>) that beauty does pleaſe; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
confeſs, all that pleaſeth to be Fair: and ſo that which a depraved taſte thinks
good, ought not to be eſteemed ſo therefore. How now friend? (replied <hi>Hylas</hi>)
What, one of <hi>Sylvanders</hi> diſciples? Perhaps thou thinkeſt as he does, that beauty is a
right proportion, and a true mixture of colours; Oh how groſly thou art miſtaken,
if thou thinkeſt ſo? Beauty is nothing but an opinion of her whom we judge to be
ſo: and to demonſtrate it unto thee; when a woman has a little mouth, a well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
noſe, a cleer skin, a freſh complexion, and buxſom plumpneſs, doſt thou
not call this beauty? I do ſo, anſwered <hi>Corilas;</hi> then tell me (replied <hi>Hylas</hi>) beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and uglineſs, are they the Mother and the Daughter of one another, or are they
contraries? Certainly, ſaid <hi>Corilas,</hi> beauty does never engender uglineſs, and they
are ſo contrary, that the one cannot be without deſtruction unto the other. Then
confeſs, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> that beauty, and uglineſs are only in opinion: for I will ſhew
thee how that which very oft we eſteem Fair, does ſeem very ugly unto us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as opinion commands. When a dog has a crooked noſe, a wide mouth, large
lips, and eares hanging down to the ground, do they not ſay, that ſuch a one is a
very fair and a fine dog, and yet all theſe are quite contrary unto what you call fair.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53527:153"/>
All this were right, replied <hi>Corilas</hi> and ſmiled, if the beauty of a Woman, and the
beauty of a Dog were all one and the ſame thing. Nay, nay, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
will not paſs, and if thou wert but as learned as thy maſter <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I would
ask thee queſtions concerning Ideas of Beauty: But thou my Friend, who art not
ſo high a Flyer, I muſt deal with thee by demonſtrations more eaſie and ſenſible:
Thou thinkeſt that thou haſt given me a ſufficient anſwer, in ſaying, That the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Woman, and the beauty of a Dog are not the ſame: But what wilt thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
when I ſhew thee that the beauty of Women has a contrary eſtimation: The
Gauls eſteem white to be Beauty, the Moors eſteem Black to be the ſame: The
Tranſalpines loves thoſe that are high coloured, almoſt red, they eſteem great and
fat women to be the prime Beauties, the Gauls are for the ſlender and lean: The
Greeks admire the Black eye, the Gauls the Grey. All <hi>Europe</hi> eſteem a little mouth,
red lips, and an even proportioned noſe: The <hi>Affricans</hi> quite contrary, a wide
mouth, flapping lips, and a large ſaddle noſe: Now my good friend, prithee tell
me, wherein does Beauty conſiſt? If thou doſt deny it to be in the opinion of him
that looks upon it, tell me no more that <hi>Alexis</hi> is fairer then <hi>Stella,</hi> ſince thou
judgeſt by the Genius and Rules of thy Country, and I by mine, which is <hi>Camargue;</hi>
for I will tell thee, that according to the Rules of that place where I was born, there
is none ſo fair as ſhe who pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>Every one did laugh ſo much at the diſcourſe of the Inconſtant <hi>Hylas,</hi> that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilas</hi>
could not anſwer him: and juſt as he began, they heard a Shepherd begin to
ſing, who by his voice was known to be <hi>Sylvander.</hi> All the company did preſently
turn their eyes upon <hi>Hylas,</hi> as if they did advertize him, that now he was like to have
a more powerful enemy. <hi>Stella</hi> who took notice of it: Servant (ſaid ſhe) all the
company looks upon you, to ſee whether you begin to look pale at the encounter of
this fierce Champion: I amongſt the reſt do expect to ſee what defence you will
make of my Beauty, for I ſhould be very glad for your own honours ſake, if you
can with honour bring about the enterprize: Not that I care for my own Intereſt at
all, for I do know very well that if Beauty do conſiſt in opinion, there is not a
Shepherdeſs in the world who has more of it then I have. Miſtris, anſwered he, let
this Giant come when he will, I value him not, it is not the firſt time we have grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together. Then ſaid <hi>Corilas,</hi> I am confident the victories were never doubtful.
No more then thoſe I obtained over you, anſwered <hi>Hylas.</hi> I ſhould confeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Corilas,</hi> if you could perſwade me that <hi>Stella</hi> is fairer then <hi>Alexis,</hi> you have
gotten a moſt ſignal victory of me. It is very hard, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> to perſwade a
man that is wilful; but I am contented that all who hear us, do judge me to be in the
right. If they do, replied <hi>Corilas,</hi> it may be ſaid that Right is without Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Sylvander</hi> came unto them, with a countenance of contentment
more then he had cauſe for: For <hi>Diana,</hi> who was not able to diſſemble her anger,
and left her countenance ſhould diſcover it more then ſhe was willing, ſhe went unto
<hi>Phillis,</hi> and whiſpered in her ear; I beſeech you Siſter (ſaid ſhe) do not follow me:
for I am conſtrained to go unto <hi>Aſtrea</hi> upon a buſineſs which I forgot, and I would
not by any means draw you from this good company. I will do whatſoever you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> but I ſhall be very glad to go with you. Do what you
pleaſe, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> but if you do come, let it be a little after me: Upon this ſhe
went away four or five paces; and then, as if ſhe had remembred ſomthing which
ſhe had once forgotten, ſhe turned haſtily back to <hi>Phillis,</hi> and ſaid unto her in a low
voice; Be ſure Siſter you remember the Bracelet of my Hair, for I deſire you by all
means to get it from him; and afterwards I ſhall be extreamly deſirous to hear what
diſcourſe you have had with this Lover of <hi>Madonthe.</hi> Siſter, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> you
believe upon too light grounds, but if you will, I ſhall ſpeak unto <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and
give you an accompt of his anſwer. His anſwer! ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> No Siſter, I deſire
it not, nor any thing elſe from him, but that unfortunate Bracelet which he had of
mine; But if you will take ſo much pains as to obſerve his countenance and geſture
when you ask it of him, you will do me a pleaſure if you relate it unto me. I know
your mind, anſwered <hi>Phillis</hi> and ſmiled, and therefore trouble your ſelf no further,
but commit the care of it to me. Upon this <hi>Diana</hi> went away as faſt as ſhe could
go, and durſt hardly look back, leſt ſhe ſhould give ſome ſuſpition of the paſſion
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53527:153"/>
which ſhe deſired to conceal. On the other ſide, <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Astrea</hi> who were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the company, purpoſely to enjoy themſelves in freedom of diſcourſe,
they were no ſooner alone, but <hi>Aſtrea</hi> with contentment, began thus: I cannot tell
Miſtris what will be the end of my Enterprize, nor how the Deſtinies will diſpoſe of
me; but this beginning is ſo infinitely pleaſing unto me, that nothing can be added
unto my deſires, for I am able to ſay, that hopes never durſt promiſe unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo much as the kindneſs of my ſweet Miſtris hath granted unto me. Servant,
ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſuch is your merit, that you may well aſſure your ſelf of all the favours
you can deſire from me: But if you will oblige me, conſider I beſeech you how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
the Heavens are to me in meeting with you: For having ſuch a bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the change in that woman whom I loved ſo well, and yet do love
her, that bitter memory of her is driven from my heart, by the ſweetneſs which I
find in your amity, making it appear that the beſt remedy againſt a miſery, is alwaies
the contrary. Give me leave, ſweet Miſtris, replied <hi>Aſtrea</hi> with a little ſmile, to tell
you, that by theſe extream favours which you do me, you do make me jealous. Is
it, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> becauſe I ſay that I do love this Maid ſtill, of whoſe change I
complain ſo much? Have I not a little reaſon for it, ſaid <hi>Astrea?</hi> Servant ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi>
You have no reaſon for it; for I love you as my Servant, and her as my Miſtris. This
anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> does not remove my jealouſie, but rather much more augment it,
becauſe the love which one bears unto a Miſtris, does much ſurpaſs the good will
which one bears unto a Servant. Well Servant, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> to let you ſee that I
will conform my ſelf unto any thing you would have me, I will take this courſe: To
ceaſe loving this woman of whom we ſpeak, is impoſſible, as well becauſe it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ſaid that I am unconſtant, as becauſe it would be an unpardonable error to ſee
ſo much merits and not love them: But to cut the thred as even as I can betwixt you,
I will love this changeling ſtill, but I will love her only for your ſake. Perhaps I
ſhould be ſatisfied with this promiſe, if I did underſtand it, replied <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> My
meaning is, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> That I will love her only, becauſe I am certain that when
you do know her, you will love her as well as I do: and if it do not prove ſo, then
I proteſt that I will not love her: But Servant, I remember you once told me, that
you did love a Shepherd, I beſeech you let me know who that happy man is; for if
our amity continue, as I make no queſtion but it will, then it is not reaſonable we
ſhould live together, as we are reſolved to do, and let any thing be concealed from
each other. Though <hi>Alexis</hi> had a great deſire to know the cauſe of his Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet this queſtion came out before ſhe was well aware, otherwiſe, her fears of
a ſharp anſwer would doubtleſs have ſtopped her mouth: But the word being out,
and paſt recal, ſhe expected <hi>Aſtreas</hi> anſwer, as a ſentence of either life or death. The
Shepherdeſs on the other ſide, or rather the new <hi>Druide,</hi> ſhe was a little troubled at
this queſtion, and knew not well what anſwer to return; but at laſt, after ſhe had
ſtood a while mute, ſhe returned this anſwer, with a deep ſigh: Ah Miſtris! you
command me to tell you a thing which hath coſt me many a bitter tear; and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
memory of it cannot come into my mind without much ſad reſentment: But ſince
I am forced unto it by your command, I will ſhut up my ſorrows within my ſoul, and
tell you, becauſe I have made a vow never to diſobey you. Know therefore Miſtris,
that the name of this Shepherd whom I loved is <hi>Celadon,</hi> and an enmity that was
betwixt our Families, was not able to give any ſtop unto the affection that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us; but when we were in our higheſt hopes of a happy concluſion, Death did
raviſh him away from amongſt men, and made me a widdow before I was married.
This, Miſtris, is it that hath coſt me a Sea of Tears, and I beſeech you pardon me that
I make no longer a relation of it unto you: for beſides that I think it both out of
ſeaſon, and impertinent; alſo I deſire you to have ſo much pity upon your Servant,
as not to open a wound, which perhaps will never be cured, and which is the moſt
ſenſible that ever any received. <hi>Alexis</hi> might well have been contented with this
anſwer, but his extream deſire to know the full cauſe of his miſery, urged him to go
further, and ſay; I am very ſorry Servant, I ſhould be any cauſe of your ſad reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but you may think that this my curioſity is no ſmall teſtimony of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to you; and therefore if this conſideration have any influence upon your ſoul, I
beſeech you tell me why and how this Shepherd died, when he was at the very top
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53527:154"/>
of all his hopes? Ah Miſtris, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you touch the wound where it is moſt
ſore, and yet let the pain be what it will, I cannot diſobey you.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was ready to ſatisfie the <hi>Druide,</hi> they were at the end of the long
Walk; and when they turned back, they ſpied the Shepherdeſs <hi>Diana</hi> at the other
end, who was coming to them, purpoſely to avoid the ſight of <hi>Sylvander. Aſtrea</hi>
was very glad of this encounter, which would ſerve her for an excuſe in not ſatisfying
the curioſity of <hi>Alexis;</hi> who deſiring to have no witneſſes, was the firſt which
entreated her to defer this diſcourſe until another time.</p>
                     <p>Preſently after, <hi>Diana</hi> came unto them, with a countenance that ſpoke the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
ſhe had received by meeting with <hi>Sylvander:</hi> And becauſe this alteration
was very apparent, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> perceived it as ſoon as ever they ſaw her. This
moved <hi>Alexis</hi> to ask her whether ſhe was not well: to whom ſhe anſwered yes, but
was on the contrary much delighted at the diſcourſe of <hi>Hylas</hi> againſt Beauty: But
ſaid ſhe, he found a more eaſie Antagoniſt of <hi>Corilas</hi> then he will of <hi>Sylvander.
Sylvander!</hi> ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> is he in the Country? Yes, anſwered <hi>Diana</hi> faintly, he
came juſt as I came away, and I ſaw all the company preparing themſelves to hear
him. Then <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſmiled, and turned towards <hi>Alexis;</hi> Miſtris, ſaid ſhe unto her,
you need not ask <hi>Diana</hi> whether ſhe be ill, for I know from whence proceeds that
alteration which we obſerved in her face. The reaſon of it is, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> becauſe
I made ſuch haſte in coming to you; and indeed I have not found my ſelf of late ſo
well as I was wont to be. This excuſe, replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> cannot hide it from us, nor
will our amity permit you ſhould be thus cloſe unto us. Do you not conſider (ſaid
<hi>Diana</hi>) in whoſe preſence you are? Very well, replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> both what I ſay, and
in whoſe preſence; But my Miſtris is pleaſed to allow us ſo much liberty and freedom,
that you ought not to uſe any ſuch diſtimulations and diſguiſements, which it ſeems
you would hide your ſelf withal, both from her and me. Servant, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi>
and ſmiled, unleſs you will have me accuſe you of the ſame fault for which you blame
<hi>Diana,</hi> you will tell me openly what it is that ſhe diſſembles. Miſtris, anſwered
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> preſently, I cannot conceal any thing which you have a deſire to know: but
leſt this Shepherdeſs ſhould have any reaſon to complain againſt me, I beſeech you
command me, and I will tell you. Then I command you, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> with all the
power that you have given me over you. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> offering to ſpeak, <hi>Diana</hi> put her
hand before her mouth, and hindered her: But <hi>Aſtrea</hi> putting her hand away, and
pulling <hi>Alexis</hi> betwixt them, <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid ſhe, though it coſt me my life, I will obey my
Miſtris in all her commands. Madam, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> Do not either hear or believe
her, for ſhe cannot tell you any thing either of truth, or worth your hearing: But
if you pleaſe, you may ſpend your time much better in hearing the diſputes between
<hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Sylvander,</hi> which cannot chuſe but be very pleaſant, ſince your ſelf is
concerned in it; for the Diſpute is betwixt your Beauty and <hi>Stellas.</hi> We will do ſo
ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſince you will have us, though neither <hi>Aſtrea</hi> nor I have any great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in our new Habits; and as we go, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſhall tell us what it is which you
are ſo ſhye in imparting to us. I would not have her tell you Fancies and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for truths, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> eſpecially ſuch imaginations as cannot be told with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much offence. Then <hi>Alexis</hi> taking in each hand one, they walked that way
from whence <hi>Diana</hi> came: And <hi>Aſtrea</hi> began thus: Siſter, ſaid ſhe, you will be
ſoon offended if what I ſhall ſay will do it: For when I aſſure my Miſtris that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
which ſhe obſerves in your face proceeds only from your meeting with <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi>
do I tell any thing but what is truth? Why ſhould ſhe change her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
(ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) at the ſeeing of one whom ſhe ſo much loves and honours?
Miſtris, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I beſeech you do but look upon her, and you ſhall ſee her face
anſwer for me. <hi>Diana</hi> then held her hands before her eyes, and turning her head
the other way, ſhe held it ſo a long while, and would not be ſeen: But at laſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that her companion would certainly tell what ſhe deſired to conceal, ſhe
thought it better to tell it her ſelf, then ſuffer another to do it. Madam, ſaid ſhe
and ſmiled, What <hi>Aſtrea</hi> tells you is a meer Imagination: but ſince you have ſuch a deſire
to know, I had rather tell it my ſelf, then ſuffer her; and when I have told you,
then judge what probabilities there is in the matter. You know Madam, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Wager that was betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Sylvander,</hi> this Shepherd ſeemed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53527:154"/>
long as if he had really loved me, and ſince we have diſcovered that he is extreamly
in love with <hi>Madonthe.</hi> Who is that <hi>Madonthe?</hi> asked <hi>Alexis.</hi> A ſtranger, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who was here a while amongſt us, and one whom <hi>Diana</hi> has an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that <hi>Sylvander</hi> is in love withal. An opinion, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> Why Siſter do
you not poſitively ſay, ſhe is one whom <hi>Sylvander</hi> loves as much as he can love, for
you know it to be true? Did I know it, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I would ſay as you do, but
I ſwear that I think all he does is only out of civility. Civility! cryed out <hi>Diana,</hi>
Do you call it Civility to cry, to pray, to beg, to importune, and to kneel at the
feet of <hi>Madonthe,</hi> to get leave that he may follow her? If this be civility, then I
do not know what is Love. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you believe all that <hi>Laonice</hi> tells
you, and I would have you ſuſpend your Belief, until the Shepherd return, that
you may have the truth from his own mouth. Fie, fie Friend, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you ſhould ſpeak thus: Would you have me look for any truth from the mouth
of a Man? a man in Love? Or (to ſpeak all in one word) from a <hi>Sylvander?</hi> from
him that thinks he can by the volubility of wit and tongue blind the eyes of our
mind, as Juglers do the eyes of our Body? No, no, there is no credit to be given
unto any thing he ſays. Why ſhould you think, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that <hi>Sylvander</hi> loves
any but your ſelf? I never thought he loved me, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> nor ever had
any intention to ſuffer him. Surely, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you had an opinion once that he
did love you; but if he did not, why ſhould he take ſo much pains about you as he
did? To paſs away his time, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> or becauſe he had nothing elſe to do.
Do you think, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that ſo fine a Wit as <hi>Sylvanders</hi> can find it ſelf nothing
to do but to trifle away his time about one whom he loves not? You may remember
Siſter, if you pleaſe, how that Shepherd lived before he caſt any amorous eye upon
you, and compare that time with the time of his love unto you, and conſider what
a difference there was; which of your commands, nay the leaſt ſhaddow of your
will did he not obſerve as a Law inviolable? To be brief Siſter, Tell me what greater
reverence he could render unto any Grandee upon earth, nay unto the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
then he hath alwaies done unto you? And whether there be not certain ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes,
ſigns, and conſequents of a real love, let any hearer judge? Siſter, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Diana,</hi> ſince you ſpeak ſo highly in behalf of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I believe you think
as you ſay; But I who never ſaw, nor will ſee any ſuch matters, I will believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of <hi>Laonice;</hi> and if thoſe ſigns which you have obſerved in him be any teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Love, they may be of his love to <hi>Madonthe.</hi> No replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for I
have heard him in my preſence ſay a hundred and an hundred times, that it is you,
and you only whom he loves. It is the common quality of men, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi>
thus to delude thoſe ſilly women who hear them: and do you not think he has ſaid
as much in private unto his dear <hi>Madonthe?</hi> But if I be not much deceived, he never
ſaid as much to me, nor ever ſhall. I perceive, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> you are apt to believe
all that is ſaid againſt <hi>Sylvander,</hi> as confidently as if you had ſeen it your ſelf. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it Madam, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> becauſe it is true: But I am contented to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
him with all my heart, and will believe all that <hi>Laonice</hi> has told me. Me thinks
ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> you are over-apt, and too partial to believe the reports of that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
you ought to ſuſpend your belief and judgement, till you hear him anſwer
for himſelf. Ah Madam, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I aſſure you that I care ſo little either for his
love or hate, as I would not have one word more ſpent about the matter: For do
you think to draw truth from a falſe and diſſembling tongue? For my part, ſaid
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I cannot believe him in any fault: But if he be in fault, his fault is his love
unto <hi>Madonthe;</hi> now when ſhe is gone, his fault will appear; and if he be in no
fault, then he will continue his addreſſes ſtill unto you. I do not think (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>)
that he will continue them. But if he do continue them, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> what will you
ſay then? I will ſay, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> that he will be aſhamed to ſhew his Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.
If he was aſhamed of that, replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he would not have ſo freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
it before all thoſe who ſaw him take his leave of <hi>Madonthe.</hi> Perhaps, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Diana,</hi> he was not ſo abſolute a maſter of himſelf, but he was ſurprized with
this ſudden and unexpected departure; ſo as though he be his Arts maſter in matter
of lying, yet he could not chuſe but upon ſuch a ſurprize diſcover the truth. But
Siſter, why ſhould we ſpend ſo much time about a thing which is not worth it? Let
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53527:155"/>
us leave <hi>Sylvander</hi> to his beloved <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and have no more memory of him then
he has of us; for I believe his ſoul is capable of no thought but his ſorrows at this
ſad ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe Shepherdeſſes were thus diſcourſing, preſently after <hi>Dianas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from <hi>Phillis, Sylvander</hi> came to the place from which <hi>Diana</hi> went; and he
had hardly ſaluted all the company before <hi>Hylas</hi> accoſted him.</p>
                     <p>Will you, ſay <hi>Sylvander</hi> (ſaid he unto him) that <hi>Diana</hi> is Fairer then <hi>Stella?</hi>
Will you deny <hi>Hylas</hi> (ſaid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) that the Sun is cleerer then Darkneſs? All the
Company began to laugh at the anſwer of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and the queſtion of <hi>Hylas:</hi>
but <hi>Hylas</hi> without being at all daunted, I will maintain (ſaid he) that <hi>Stella</hi> does
not only equal, but much excel the beauty of <hi>Diana.</hi> I do not wonder at what you
ſay (anſwered <hi>Sylvander</hi>) but yet me thinks thy very ignorance ſhould have made a
better judgment then ſo; I ſhould anſwer you after another manner (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) if
I had not right on my ſide, and if I did not think to make you confeſs before we
part in the preſence of all theſe Shepherdeſſes, that <hi>Stella</hi> is fairer then <hi>Diana,</hi> at
the leaſt if you will anſwer me. Doubt not but I will anſwer unto all you ſhall ask,
ſaid <hi>Sylvander</hi> and ſmiled, but if you make me confeſs what you affirm, and which
I can never believe, I will ſay you can do more then is poſſible, and makes uſe of
ſome enchantment. The enchantments which I will uſe, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſhall be
the ſtrength of my reaſons, of which, not you, but all the company ſhall judge:
therefore <hi>Sylvander,</hi> anſwer unto this queſtion; How Fair do you think <hi>Diana</hi> to
be? As Fair, anſwered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> as any woman can be. And I, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> do
think <hi>Stella</hi> to be Fairer then any Woman in the world can be: thus you ſee <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi>
how you have ſpoken truth before you were aware; you hold the beauty of
<hi>Diana,</hi> only in the comparative degree, but I <hi>Stellas</hi> in the ſuperlative: If opinion,
replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> were to end the difference, or were that which makes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
more or leſs Fair, then I ſhould confeſs that in this argument you have in ſome
ſort the advantage of me. But how groſly are you deceived if you have that belief;
for beauty is the perfection of that which hath it: and can you ſay that perfection
is only an imagination? But can you deny, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> that beauty, even the
beauty of Women, is any thing elſe but the opinion of him who ſees it? For if it were
otherwiſe, ſhe who ſeems Fair unto one, would ſeem Fair unto all eyes, which holds
falſe in the opinion that you have of the beauty of <hi>Diana,</hi> and the greater beauty of
<hi>Stella.</hi> The ground you build upon, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> is ſuch a looſe ſand, that it
muſt needs fall preſently to ruine: for it is not opinion which ſets a value upon things,
but their own proper quality which is in them; for otherwiſe a piece of Glaſs or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimy
well wrought and counterfeited, were as good as Gold, or a right Diamond,
for they are oftentimes thought to be as good as the other: but <hi>Hylas,</hi> you know
from whence this opinion has its riſe; even from nothing but ignorance: for if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
knew that the Alchimy, and the Glaſs, were counterfeit; they would never ſet
ſo much eſteem upon them: the very like is of the judgement which you make of
<hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Stella;</hi> for did you know what beauty is, you would give a ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not raſhly at random as you do: for my part, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> I cannot
think my ſelf in any error, I have moſt men on my ſide; and moſt ignorants alſo,
replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> yet if you will refer it unto the vote of this company, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
you will find very few on your ſide: for as there is commonly more ſound
then ſick perſons, ſo there are more ſound then ſimple judgements, otherwiſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was defective in her works, and did not accompliſh them according to the
right rule, which to think, were a blaſphemy both againſt her, and the God of
Nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvander</hi> having an ample field for his diſcourſe, would have continued it longer,
if <hi>Hylas</hi> had not interrupted him with another queſtion.</p>
                     <p>I know <hi>Sylvander</hi> (ſaid he) that it will be a very dear year when you want words:
but anſwer me to this; If beauty be not meer opinion, then how comes it to paſs
that one ſhould affect the grey eye, another the black, a third the brown, and every
one according to their ſeveral fancies; is this from ignorance? whole Provinces we
ſee of the ſame opinion, and contrary unto another; this, anſwered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> is
eaſily anſwered: I know the <hi>Gaules</hi> are for grey eyes; the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> black,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53527:155"/>
becauſe the women there are commonly black, and the <hi>Gaules</hi> white: now <hi>Hylas,</hi>
can you fancy that white eyes, and white hair, would ſhew well upon a black com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion;
or black hair or eyes upon a white complexion? But <hi>Hylas,</hi> all theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments
which you menaced, cannot make me confeſs <hi>Stella</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and gave me a charge to get a bracelet of her hair from you, which ſhe gave
you, for ſhe ſayes the time that you were to keep it being expired, there is
no reaſon ſuch a teſtimony of good will ſhould remain with one who can make no
better uſe of it. <hi>Sylvander</hi> was ſtruck dead with wonder, he ſtepped a pace or two
back from <hi>Phillis;</hi> folded his arms a croſs his breſt, and being not able to open his
mouth, he fixed his eyes upon the ground, and ſtood like a Statue without any life
or motion. <hi>Phillis</hi> ſeeing him ſtand ſo long in this ſad poſture, ſhe had compaſſion
upon him, and pulled him by the arm: he ſtarted out of his ſtudy, and looked wildly
about him, as if he were affrighted out of his wits, and ſaid, Oh God, what fault
have I committed againſt thy power? Doubtleſs it is ſome great one, ſince you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me to be ſo unjuſtly condemned for a fault which I never committed, and which
I never will commit. Theſe expoſtulations, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and interrupted him, are all
in vain, for you know, the God of Love is Priviledged above all the reſt of the Gods,
and that Heaven never puniſheth his falſities. But Shepherdeſs, ſaid <hi>Sylvander,</hi> do
you and <hi>Diana</hi> alſo believe that I have no good will unto her? I do not ſay that I
believe it, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> but I ſay that if all be true which is told <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhe has no
reaſon to Love you: for do you think <hi>Sylvander,</hi> that ſhe is a Shepherdeſs that will
be contented to be a pretence for your affection unto another? Do you find ſo little
merit in her, as that ſhe is not worthy to be ſerved any further then as your ſtalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
horſe, to hide another amity? Tricks and diſſimulations may perhaps ſomtimes
deceive ſuch as do not ſuſpect any treaſon in them; but when notice is taken of them
which rubbed a little, it will preſently ſhew its falſity. There is nothing comparable
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53527:156"/>
to a free, cleer, and genuine way in all things; ſubtilties, tricks, and fetches, are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a vile and baſe Spirit. I do confeſs (ſaid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) all that you ſay, but
I beſeech you what have I done? You know, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> better then any: the
thing is made publique, and if you will have it from my mouth, I ſay <hi>Sylvander,</hi> that
you have made a ſhew of loving <hi>Diana,</hi> whilſt you have given your whole ſoul and
affection unto <hi>Madonthe:</hi> this is a truth which you cannot deny, unleſs you be the
moſt brazen faced Shepherd in the whole univerſe; all the Country knows this, and
laughs at it; <hi>Diana</hi> her ſelf amongſt the reſt makes it her rallery; if you be ſorry
for any thing, it is, that <hi>Diana</hi> cares not for your Love: It is a great credit indeed
to be courted by an unknown vagabond Shepherd as you are; eſpecially to her who is
to eminent in virtue and merit; but all our ſorrows proceeds from our being ſo much
miſtaken in you: Tell me truly, <hi>Sylvander,</hi> what deſign did you aim at in all your
diſſimulations? How could you imagine you ſhould continue long undiſcovered?
And when you were diſcovered, could you think to avoid a ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ere but juſt cenſure
from all the world? <hi>Diana</hi> is Fairer at her worſt, then <hi>Madonthe</hi> is at her beſt; the
very frowns of <hi>Diana,</hi> are ſweeter then <hi>Madonthes</hi> ſmiles: and <hi>Dianas</hi> anger is more
eſtimable then <hi>Madonthes</hi> careſſes and favours: where was your eyes and your wits
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> when you made ſo bad a choiſe? Can <hi>Diana</hi> believe all this? replied
<hi>Sylvander:</hi> Believe it, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> why ſhould ſhe not believe it, when every one
ſays it? And ſince ſhe has ſeen ſuch apparent effects of it, for elſe why ſhould you
he every way ſo obſequious and obſervant of that ſtranger? Why all that eloquence
to perſwade her not to depart? Why elſe ſhould you caſt your ſelf at her feet? Nay
why tears when you bade adieu? and why that unſeaſonable voyage which you made
with her? Now <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I tell you all this, not that <hi>Diana</hi> cares a ruſh for it,
but on the contrary, ſhe thanks God, that ſhe is ſo well rid of all your importunities
and troubles; my aimes are only to let you know, that all your diſſimulations and
tricks are diſcovered, and that there is no more hopes of deceiving us by any arts you
can uſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſpoke <hi>Phillis</hi> unto <hi>Sylvander,</hi> not that ſhe had any commiſſion for it from
<hi>Diana,</hi> whoſe modeſty was ſuch, and Spirit ſo great, that ſhe had rather have died
then make any ſhew that the diſſimulations of <hi>Sylvander</hi> did diſpleaſe her; but <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
did it, becauſe ſhe was angry with that Shepherd, and reſented the injury done
unto her Companion, as her own, And well it was they were ſo far from the reſt
of the company; for otherwiſe it would have been impoſſible but every one would
have perceived the diſorder which this diſcourſe had cauſed in him, and which indeed
was greater then <hi>Phillis</hi> expected. His regret to ſee himſelf accuſed of a fault which
he never committed; the loſs of <hi>Dianas</hi> favour which he hoped that he had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the harſh language of <hi>Phillis,</hi> which he ſuppoſed came from his Miſtris,
all theſe did ſo ſurpriſe him, that he was not able to utter one word; he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to lean himſelf againſt a tree, and growing weak, he fell down to the
ground, where ſuch a faintneſs of heart ſeiſed upon him, that within a little time,
he was immoveable, and without any ſenſe. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who ſaw him in this condition,
did pull him ſeveral times by the arm, and afterwards, ſeeing him ready to dye, ſhe
ran to a little Rivelet which was cloſe by, and taking ſome water in her hands, ſhe
came and threw it in his face: but theſe remedies doing no good, ſhe was extreamly
affrighted, and ran that way which ſhe ſaw all the company paſs, to call ſome to
come and help; but moſt of the Shepherds were all gone to their ſeveral homes, for
it was neer dinner time; ſo as ſhe had run long in vain, had ſhe not ſpied a far off
<hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> who were going in gentle pace to hear the diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Sylvander</hi> and <hi>Hylas,</hi> although <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Astrea</hi> had no great deſire to be
ſeen amongſt all that company in thoſe habits; nor <hi>Diana</hi> any mind to be in the
place where <hi>Sylvander</hi> was: ſo as it ſeems they walked without any deſign but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the air; and as if the good Genius of <hi>Sylvander</hi> had conducted them thither,
to ſee him in that condition. When <hi>Phillis</hi> ſaw them, ſhe cryed out as loud as ever
ſhe could, and made ſigns unto them with her hand to make haſte, though ſhe was
ſo affrighted and out of breath, that ſhe could not be heard at any diſtance, <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
was the firſt that heard her, and fearing that ſome miſchance had hapned unto her:
I beſeech you, ſaid ſhe unto the reſt, let us make all the haſte we can to help <hi>Phillis;</hi>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:53527:156"/>
for I ſee her run and make ſigns, certainly ſhe ſtands in need of us. Upon this all
of them doubled their pace; and <hi>Diana,</hi> as if ſome Demon had inſpired her, did
feel ſuch a kind of unaccuſtomed temper upon her heart, as made her almoſt divine
what the matter was. When <hi>Phillis</hi> was come nearer, and within diſtance of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Oh <hi>Diana! Diana!</hi> cryed ſhe out, <hi>Sylvander</hi> is dead! <hi>Sylvander</hi> is dead!
<hi>Sylvander!</hi> replied <hi>Diana,</hi> who killed him? You and I, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> you in
commanding me, and I in obeying you. At this <hi>Diana</hi> was ſeized with ſo much
ſorrow, that ſhe could not ſpeak a word, nor go one foot further; making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that in her heart ſhe never believed what was reported of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and
that what ſhe ſaid againſt him, was only words of an offended Love, which was
prone to jealouſie. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> on the contrary, who did highly eſteem the
vertue and merit of that Shepherd, Alas, alas, ſaid they, is he dead? It is but too
true, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> his face is pale, and all tears; do but follow me a little, and
you ſhall find him in the condition I tell you. Then both of them began to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her as faſt as they could, they preſently ſaw him lying all along upon the ground,
and in the ſame condition <hi>Phillis</hi> left him. <hi>Diana</hi> who followed a ſlower pace after
them, leſt ſhe ſhould too much diſcover that paſſion which ſhe deſired to hide, ſhe
no ſooner caſt her eye upon the Shepherd, but her cheeks were all tears, which ſhe
was not able to with hold, and which to teſtifie the ſorrows of her heart, forced
their paſſage through her eye-lids: And becauſe the modeſty of this Shepherdeſs
would not permit her to diſcover this paſſion, ſhe ſtayed ten or twelve paces from
her companions, and turned her ſelf fromwards them, ſeeming as if the accident did
not trouble her. But <hi>Alexis, Aſtrea,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> out of abundance of compaſſion,
were very buſie about him; one lifted up his arm, another his head, and a third
feeling if his heart did beat; but finding no ſignes of life in him, they gave over all
hopes, and ſaid unto one another that he was dead. Theſe words reaching the
ears of <hi>Diana,</hi> were ſo many ſharp ſwords, which wounded her heart with new ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows:
and coming unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſhe whiſpered her in the ear; Good Siſter ſeek a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his arm for the Bracelet which you know of, leſt it ſhould be found. <hi>Phillis</hi> to
give her companion ſatisfaction, and thinking that ſhe had good reaſon to deſire
that none ſhould know of it, ſhe took the Shepherds arm, and pulled off the Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let;
But as ſhe was untying it, ſhe and her companions alſo ſpied a mark which in all
probability he had worn from his Mothers womb; it was a branch of Miſleto, ſo
plain, that any might know it to be ſo; for the leaves, the berries, and the knots of
Branches, although they were not green, yet were ſo perfectly marked, that none
could doubt it to be Miſleto.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt they were buſie in looking upon this Miſleto, and untying the Bracelet, and
<hi>Diana</hi> at a good diſtance from them, <hi>Sylvander</hi> revived out of his ſwoon; but ſo
much amazed to ſee himſelf in this condition, and amongſt ſo many Shepherdeſſes,
that he knew not whether he dreamed or waked. All three did not a little rejoyce
to ſee him alive, after they had lamented his death; for the vertue and merit of that
Shepherd, did get the love of all that knew him. When he revived, <hi>Phillis</hi> had not
quite untied the Bracelet; and though he perceived they had unlooſed his ſleeve,
yet he did not perceive the theft, but thought that they only untied his ſleeve to feel
his pulſe. <hi>Alexis</hi> ſeeing that he ſpake not a word, but let them do what they would
unto him, ſhe thought it good to begin. Shepherd, ſaid ſhe unto him, How comes
this to paſs? What? Does your Courage fail you? <hi>Sylvander</hi> taking <hi>Alexis</hi> for a
Shepherdeſs by reaſon of her Habit, he thanked her and her companions for the
pains they had taken about him, and then told them, that it was rather a ſigne of
want of courage to endure the miſeries which he reſented, and not die. No, no,
ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you are deceived, for it is courage to ſurmount all manner of accidents
whatſoever: and believe me, your miſery is not ſo great, but being a man you may
eaſily ſurmount it. <hi>Phillis</hi> who feared that this diſcourſe would renew his grief,
Come, come, ſaid ſhe, Let us talk no longer of miſeries and diſaſters, but let us think
how to cure them. <hi>Sylvander</hi> then anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> taking her for a <hi>Druide</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of her Habit; This Shepherdeſs, Madam ſaid he, knows the Grand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ur of my
diſeaſe better then any other, and therefore, ſhe thinking it to be incurable, has
reaſon not to have it ſpoke of. But (ſaid he, and raiſed himſelf up, though with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53527:157"/>
pain) the good Genius which hitherto hath had a care of my deplorable life, will
conduct me ere long unto a place where I hope to find a cure, though that Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs
think it impoſſible. Upon this, thanking them for their help, he offered to go
away: But all of them conſidering how wildly and ragingly his eyes looked, they
were afraid that he would kill himſelf. <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> as beſt experienced in the like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
ſhe took hold of his arm, and ſeeing that he took her for a <hi>Druide,</hi> Know
Shepherd, ſaid ſhe unto him, that the Genius of whom you ſpeak, commanded me
to come hither, as well to help you, as to tell you for him, That he would have you
live with aſſurance, that his aid ſhall never fail you, neither in this occaſion, nor
any other: Alſo that within three days you ſhall find ſome favourable effects of his
aſſiſtance, unleſs you want will and courage to wait the time. Remember what I ſay,
and I take all theſe Shepherdeſſes to witneſs that I have told you. Upon this <hi>Aſtrea</hi>
who counterfeited her voice as well as ſhe could leſt ſhe ſhould be known, ſhe went
away, ſeeming as if ſhe did not know any of the Shepherdeſſes in the company, and
as if her coming thither were only upon that occaſion. Now, ſee what power an
opinion of Divine aſſiſtance has over the ſpirits of men; <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had no ſooner
pronounced theſe words, but <hi>Sylvander</hi> received them as coming from an Oracle:
ſo as beginning to hope again, thoſe wilde and raging looks which deſpair had
brought into his eyes, did leave them, and his countenance became more calm and
ſetled: Afterwards with a religious look, he kneeled down upon the ground, lifted
his hands and eyes up to heaven, and uncovering his head, he ſaid: From you, oh
omnipotent <hi>Tautates</hi> and <hi>Tharamis,</hi> Do I expect that help which from no other I
can hope for: You know my puniſhment to be unjuſt, and that I am not guilty of
that fault for which I am condemned: Help, therefore, Oh great Gods! thoſe
injured perſons who truſt in you. <hi>Alexis</hi> who ſaw <hi>Aſtrea</hi> go away, and who
could not endure to be from her, ſhe intended to follow: and becauſe ſhe was afraid
leſt the Shepherd ſhould know her in <hi>Astreas</hi> clothes, ſhe would ſtay no longer:
upon theſe conſiderations, they made a ſigne unto <hi>Phillis</hi> to ſtay with him a while,
leſt he ſhould follow them: At parting, ſhe ſaid unto him, Remember Shepherd
you follow the good advice your good Genius hath given you, and take heed you do
not make your ſelf incapable of that help and aſſiſtance which he hath promiſed. Then
not ſtaying for his anſwer, ſhe went away towards <hi>Astrea,</hi> whom ſhe quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took:
And it ſeems that Heaven would have <hi>Aſtrea</hi> render the ſame Office
unto <hi>Sylvander,</hi> which formerly <hi>Celadon</hi> had done upon the like occaſion unto
<hi>Vrcaſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Phillis</hi> was alone with <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſhe was much moved to think what harm
ſhe had done him, which indeed was much more then ever ſhe intended: Shepherd,
ſaid ſhe unto him, ſince heaven has taken care of your conduct, I hope you will find
more contentment then ever yet you did: but I beſeech you tell me, and tell me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly
and freely, and with an aſſurance that you tell it unto one of your beſt
friends, and one that can keep a ſecret, and will, if it concern your good: Is it true
or no that you love <hi>Madonthe?</hi> It is not a crime unpardonable to love a fair woman
as ſhe is: There is none but does know that it was the wager which was betwixt us
did give beginning unto the Love which you bore unto <hi>Diana;</hi> a thing which cannot
oblige you any longer then the time of the wager, and the cauſe which gave it a
being.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt <hi>Phillis</hi> was ſpeaking to this purpoſe unto <hi>Sylvander, Diana</hi> though ſhe
went away before the Shepherd revived, yet ſhe ſaw him riſe up, for ſhe was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
turning and looking back to ſee what would become of him: And when ſhe
ſaw he was not dead, as ſhe once thought that he was, for all her anger, ſhe could
not chuſe but be extreamly glad, and reſented as much joy, as her apprehenſions of
his death cauſed ſorrow. Her jealouſie and anger had ſo much power, as to make
her ſenſible of the offence which ſhe thought was given her, but not to extinguiſh
the affection which really ſhe had unto that Shepherd; and upon this occaſion, ſhe
gave an apparent proof of it; ſince ſeeing <hi>Aſtrea</hi> go away, and preſently after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi>
follow, ſhe was ſwelled with an extraordinary curioſity to hear what they two
(<hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Sylvander</hi>) ſaid, and be unſeen, aſſuring her ſelf that their diſcourſe
would be relating unto her: And in order to this deſigne, ſhe crept behind a Buſh,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53527:157"/>
and came time enough to hear the queſtion which <hi>Phillis</hi> asked, and the anſwer
which the Shepherd gave, which was this, <hi>Phillis</hi> (ſaid he) if ever the Gods did
puniſh perjury, I beſeech them to puniſh me with the rigour of their fury, if I do
not give a true anſwer unto your queſtion: may the <hi>Druides</hi> excommunicate me
from their ſacrifices; may they all deny me juſtice when I ask it, may men baniſh
me from their Society, may fire and water, and all the reſt of the Elements, be my
enemies, may I never thrive in any of my hopes or deſires, may all theſe curſes fall
upon me at once, if ever I Loved any but <hi>Diana.</hi> I know that this word Love is
too raſh, and does not become me, I know this declaration is too bold, conſidering
the merits of that Shepherdeſs and my own unworthineſs: but diſcreet <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your compaſſion upon me and my miſery, and knowing your good will unto
<hi>Diana;</hi> I ſhould think it a crime never to be forgiven, if I ſhould diſſemble the truth:
aſſuring my ſelf, that I ſhall find you as diſcreet in this as I have known you upon all
other occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Shepherd, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> you have reaſon to truſt me, eſpecially in any thing
that rela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es unto that Fair and Wiſe Shepherdeſs, ſince the affection which I bear
unto her, is not equalled by any but your own; and knowing her merits, and your
judgement, I will believe all you tell me concerning your affection unto her. But
Shepherd you muſt firſt clear your ſelf unto me, and give me your reaſons why yon
were ſo officious and indulgent towards <hi>Madonthe.</hi> You know <hi>Sylvander</hi> that Love is
like a little child, &amp; is offended at a ſmall thing, ſoon angry, &amp; as ſoon jealous: do you
think thoſe extraordinary indulgencies which you manifeſted unto <hi>Madonthe,</hi> the tears
you ſhed at her departure, the earneſt ſupplications you made to wait upon her into
<hi>Aquitain,</hi> nay to go with her, almoſt whether ſhe would or no; do you think I
ſay, that all theſe circumſtances coming to the knowledg of <hi>Diana,</hi> are not ſufficient
enough to make her offended at you? Ought you not to have conſidered, that as
<hi>Madonthe</hi> would not ſuffer you to follow her any further, leſt ſhe ſhould offend
<hi>Therſander</hi> whom ſhe loved, ſo you ought not to have made the motion, for fear
of making <hi>Diana</hi> jealous, whom you loved? Could you hope for any better looks
from her at your return then now you have? For my part, I think ſhe has obliged
you in treating you thus, and no otherwiſe: for if ſhe had, you might have thought
her to be in a ſtate of a cold indifferency towards you, which is a moſt certain ſign
of ſmall good will.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt <hi>Phillis</hi> talked thus, <hi>Diana</hi> who loſt not a ſillable of what ſhe ſaid, did ſo
approve of it, that if any had ſeen her, they might eaſily have known her diſeaſe.
For when <hi>Phillis</hi> talked upon thoſe points which touched her moſt, ſhe made ſuch
actions with her head, her hands, and every part of her body, as plainly ſhewed
what ſhe ſo much deſired to conceal: but when <hi>Sylvander</hi> began to ſpeak, ſhe was
immoveable: her eyes fixed upon him, and her mouth half open, and ready to
convince him of a lye upon the firſt excuſe he ſhould make: Being then thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ſhe heard him ſay thus: Diſcreet and Wiſe Shepherdeſs, I beſeech Heaven to
furniſh me with a good occaſion and opportunity to requite this compaſſion which
you ſhew upon a poor afflicted and innocent Shepherd; as innocent and as much
afflicted as any that lives upon the face of the whole univerſe: you accuſe me, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs
of a crime unto which I am ſo far from being acceſſary, much leſs guilty, as I
am conſtrained, moſt earneſtly to beſeech you, that you would be pleaſed to tell me
more cleerly and plainly, the ſault wherewith you charge me, that I may anſwer
unto it which ſuch candid ingenuity and truth as becomes me. <hi>Diana</hi> who heard
him, ſee the crafty man (ſaid ſhe to her ſelf) he knows not what to anſwer, and
he would have her make a repetition, that he may invent an excuſe in the mean time;
and then ſhe heard <hi>Phillis</hi> reply unto him thus; Confeſs freely your fault <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
here is none to hear or obſerve your actions; or if they do, none that will tell <hi>Diana:</hi> I
do believe alſo, that ſhe who acquainted her with theſe things, did not think any
harm, for ſhe ſpoke very ſimply and innocently: I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
what did ſhe ſay? She ſaid, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> that you your ſelf were inſtrumental
to your own hurt, of which, afterwards you could not cure your ſelf: for meeting
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> you acquainted her with the coming of that ſtranger, who had ſome
bad deſigns upon her: It is moſt true, anſwered the Shepherd, I did ſo: and I
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53527:158"/>
thought my ſelf obliged unto it by the Laws of Civility. The Laws of Civility did
not enjoyn you to accompany her as far as <hi>Aquitane,</hi> replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> much leſs
when ſhe denied you, to fall upon your knees, and with a torrent of tears, beg, nay
force her to give leave you might wait upon her, at the leaſt, part of a dayes journey;
telling her, after your tears had obtained leave, that ſhe might well permit you the
happineſs of ſo ſhort a time, ſince you were to endure ſo long a torment of abſence
from her. But here comes the miſery of it: when ſhe anſwered you with a ſmile,
that though her abſence did grieve, yet the preſence of <hi>Diana</hi> would comfort you:
you anſwered again, <hi>Diana</hi> merits much more then my ſervice, but I pay them unto
her only upon a wager: I wiſh ſhe were to go this journey in your room, and you
to ſtay in hers here in this Country. Do you think Shepherd that any Laws of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
oblige you to uſe any ſuch diſcourſe unto <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and to ſpeak with ſuch
ſcorn of <hi>Diana?</hi> Do you think it ſtrange ſhe ſhould be offended at you, and reſolve
to take all occaſions from you, of treating her ſo unworthily? Oh Heavens! Oh
Earth! Oh God! Oh <hi>Diana!</hi> (cri'd <hi>Sylvander</hi>) What treaſon is invented againſt
me? Treaſon, (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>) why? Can you deny it? How? replied the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
preſently, I ſay or do any ſuch things as theſe; I had rather my Sheep-hook
were run through my heart, then any ſuch thoughts ſhould be in it; do you deny
(replied <hi>Phillis</hi>) that you accompanied <hi>Madonthe,</hi> as far as ſhe would permit you?
I muſt confeſs, anſwered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> that it is true, I did accompany her, but it was
upon ſuch reaſons, as if I have done otherwiſe, I had been blamed by all thoſe that
heard of it; and that you may know the truth, give me leave to make a ſhort relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it unto you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diana</hi> hearing <hi>Sylvander</hi> prepare himſelf to ſpeak; I am confident (ſaid ſhe to
her ſelf) that if one word of truth be in his diſcourſe, it is againſt his will and deſign;
but ſee with what a brazen face he ſets himſelf to lie: Then <hi>Sylvander</hi> began thus;
Shepherdeſs (ſaid he) it is long ſince <hi>Paris</hi> was telling how that ſtranger was come
into the Country, with a bad deſign upon <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and when I ſaw him much
troubled how he ſhould acquaint her with it, I took upon me to make it known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her: he does not tell (replied <hi>Diana</hi> to her ſelf) how ready he was to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in this ſervice, leſt any other ſhould undertake that charitable office. In the
mean time <hi>Sylvander</hi> went on with his ſtory. Yeſterday morning (ſaid he) I met
her with <hi>Therſander,</hi> and I thought the blame of all the accident might be charged
upon me, if I did not acquaint her, I told her therefore as it was told me, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her eyes flow in tears, I muſt confeſs I was much moved unto compaſſion: nay
paſſion you ſhould have ſaid, (replied <hi>Diana</hi> to her ſelf) And I to aſſure her (ſaid
<hi>Sylvander</hi>) againſt the injuries of this unknown perſon, I offered my ſelf to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
her with ſome of my friends, if ſhe pleaſed. He is her Champion (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>)
and will defend her againſt all her enemies. And ſo I did (ſaid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) but it
was no further then the place where <hi>Paris</hi> ſaw that ſtranger: It was (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>)
becauſe ſhe would not ſuffer him to go any further. Could I do any leſs (ſaid <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi>)
unleſs I tranſgreſſed againſt the Laws of Civility and Humanity? If I did
any more, then what I have told you Shepherdeſs, may I be denied Heaven, and
periſh eternally as a puniſhment of my crime. But, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> did you not follow
her as far as <hi>Aquitane,</hi> or would you not if ſhe had permitted you? Had I thought,
anſwered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> that ſhe had ſtood in need of me, I muſt confeſs, I had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
her farther, thinking it the duty of man to help any in diſtreſs, Hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> we ſhall have this Shepherd become the <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and
wander from Province to Province, to fight with Giants and Monſters. But, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he, that I ſhould be importunate, or preſs her, or do any more then civilly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
her, is a thing ſo falſe, as I admire any ſhould be ſo impudent as to invent it, or
ſay it. None more likely then <hi>Sylvander</hi> (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) 'Tis true, I did offer my ſelf
(ſaid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) to be her convoy, and guard her till ſhe was out of Forreſts. But
is it true, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that you did not ſhed any tears, nor kneel down, nor
ſpeak of <hi>Diana,</hi> nor lament her departure? Now, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> is he pumping, and
preparing himſelf for a lie. Shepherdeſs, (anſwered <hi>Sylvander</hi>) if any one ſillable
of all theſe be true, let the Juſtice of Heaven ſtrike me dead immediately; let the
earth ſwallow me up alive, and never let me ſee the face of men again; let the anger
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53527:158"/>
of Gods and men do all their worſt againſt me, if all that you have ſaid unto me be
not falſe, and invented by ſome who wiſh my death, and has ſome deſigns upon
<hi>Diana.</hi> Now has he hit upon it, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> for what pretenſions or deſigns can
<hi>Laonice</hi> have upon me, or his life? Shepherd (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>) when you know who
it is, certainly you will be of another mind: But you muſt needs confeſs a fault in
accompanying this Shepherdeſs without asking leave of your Miſtris. Ah Siſter,
ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I beſeech you give no ſuch Name unto me, that Shepherd ſhall be none
of my Servant. You know <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that one who loves truly, ought
never to diſpoſe of himſelf without the Will of the party loved; why then would
you go away and never tell her? He is at a non-plus, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and knows not
what to ſay. Certainly anſwered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> if the journey which I was to take had
deſerved the name of a journey, I had done as you ſay; but ſince it was not above
two or three miles, I thought neither ſhe nor you could take any exceptions: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<hi>Madonthe</hi> departed ſo ſuddenly, as it was impoſſible for me to have done it,
unleſs I had failed in doing her that civil office. Obſerve (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) that rather
then fail <hi>Madonthe,</hi> he will fail in his duty to us. But it is impoſſible (ſaid <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>)
that the excellent wit of my Miſtris (Raze out the words, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> unleſs
you ſpeak of <hi>Madonthe.</hi>) It is impoſſible I ſay, (continued he,) that the
Judgement of <hi>Diana,</hi> which is never deceived, (Unleſs in you, ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) ſhould
ſo eaſily believe ſuch a falſity: But good Shepherdeſs tell me, If it were true that
I were in love with <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and had taken upon me that office which <hi>Paris</hi> gave
me, to acquaint her and <hi>Therſander</hi> with the coming of this ſtranger; If I ſay, I
was ſo greedy and affectionate to take it upon me, can you think my violent love
would have let me ſtay ſo long before I acquainted her? Yet if <hi>Diana</hi> pleaſe, ſhe
may remember I received this Commiſſion the ſame day that we went unto <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
and I did not acquaint them before yeſterday. Believe it Shepherdeſs, thoſe
that are enflamed with Love, are ſeldom ſo ſlow in rendring ſuch ſervices, or to ſay
better, in forgetting them as I did: for I ſwear that I never thought upon it till I
ſaw them; and had I not ſeen them, I think I ſhould have never remembred it. But
I beſeech you conſider, that if I were ſo far in love with this woman, as you ſeem
by your diſcourſe to believe, why ſhould I not follow her whitherſoever ſhe went?
What conſideration ſhould ſtay me in this Country? unleſs my love to <hi>Diana,</hi> I
know no occaſions I have elſe in it, more then any where elſe: My miſerable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
is ſuch, that I have neither Parents or Eſtate to ſtay me, nor do I get any thing
here more then my induſtry would get me in any other place. If then I do not leave
this Country to follow <hi>Madonthe,</hi> me-thinks it ſhould be a ſtronger argument unto
my Miſtris and you, that I do not love <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and that nothing ſtays me here
but the love of <hi>Diana.</hi> But I beſeech you <hi>Phillis,</hi> Did you not ſee that I did not
love her before our Wager? I know you will confeſs you never ſaw the leaſt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in me that way: I muſt confeſs, that naturally I am not prone unto that paſſion,
But then the converſation which I have had with <hi>Diana,</hi> has forced me to ſerve her;
ſhe has raviſhed my heart. I cannot tell what you have thought of me ſince I have
had the honour to live amongſt you; yet I think you have had a good opinion of
me, and thought me not without ſome Wit and Judgement, till this action whereof
I am accuſed, and which is a diſaſter ſo fatal, that I cannot tell whether the poor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtes</hi>
had a greater. What a groſs defect in Wit and Judgement were it, to chuſe
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> and reject <hi>Diana? Diana!</hi> the faireſt, the wiſeſt, and the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
woman in the whole Univerſe; and <hi>Madonthe,</hi> who only merits to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
in her reſemblance of <hi>Diana,</hi> though in an inferiour degree of perfection.
Moreover, were it not madneſs in the higheſt degree, if I knowing that <hi>Madonthe</hi>
does love a Cavalier, and wanders in queſt of him, if I ſhould pretend to divert
her: Theſe conſiderations are ſo ſtrong that when I reflect upon them, I cannot
chuſe but admire at the opinion which you have conceived of me, and fear, that
heaven which from my birth hath condemned me unto ſo many misfortunes, will have
the end of my life like the beginning.</p>
                     <p>The Shepherd had many other arguments, and was full of ſuch diſcourſe as this,
unto which <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> did hearken with much attention; for though the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Diana</hi> was extreamly prejudicated, yet being rational, theſe laſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53527:159"/>
did work upon her heart, and made her think there was ſome truth in them:
moreover, commendations which are given without ſuſpition of flattery, do get
more favour then ſuch as are given in preſence; ſo that this diſcreet Shepherdeſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to relent, and champ upon the reaſons which <hi>Sylvander</hi> urged: yet her haughty
ſpirit would hardly permit her to clear him abſolutely, but put the queſtion whether
<hi>Laonice</hi> or he ſaid truly: And that ſhe had learned enough for that time, alſo fearing
ſhe ſhould be perceived either by that Shepherd or <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſhe ſtole away as ſoftly
as ſhe could, and went to ſeek <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phillis</hi> alſo at the ſame time, thinking the Shepherd to be well recovered, and that
her ſtay any longer at that time would do him no good; Well Shepherd ſaid ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, I am very glad to hear as much as you have told me; Comfort your ſelf, and
believe that your diſcourſe ſhall not be unprofitable to you: for indeed, when I
conſider your reaſons, I believe you to be wrongfully accuſed; and I promiſe you,
I will not be mute unto <hi>Diana,</hi> but hope that ere long you ſhall find the effects of
my ſolicitation: in the interim, do what is fit to be done on your part, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
loving that Shepherdeſs, who cannot poſſibly be excelled in Beauty and merit by
any, nor equalled but by very few.</p>
                     <p>Upon this <hi>Phillis</hi> left him, and ſtayed not to hear the thanks which he would
have given her for her kind promiſes, nor the proteſtations of inviolable and eternal
affection which he would ever have unto <hi>Diana,</hi> what treatment ſoever he had from
her. But when he was alone, and none to divert him, then did his diſpleaſures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
themſelves before his eyes: And though the aſſurances which he received from
that <hi>Druide</hi> which was unknown unto him, and the promiſes which <hi>Phillis</hi> made, did
give him ſome hopes, yet the conſideration of thoſe misfortunes which beſel him
even from his cradle, did put him out of all hopes, for againſt them the arms of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
&amp; reaſon were almoſt of no validity. Being thus preſſed with extream ſorrows,
he walked gently towards the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> and ſate himſelf down upon the Bank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Then there was not a ſillable of that cruel meſſage which <hi>Phillis</hi> brought him from
<hi>Diana,</hi> but the ſolitude of that place did freſhly bring into his memory; and he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
the croſsneſs of his ſullen fate, in a thouſand various expreſſions. He had
continued longer in this lamenting vein (had not <hi>Florice, Cercinea,</hi> and <hi>Palinice,</hi>
with that ſtranger their companion, who were retiring homewards) heard him,
<hi>Cercinea</hi> knew his voice; and becauſe the ſtranger was deſirous to know how they
ſhould paſs away the reſt of the day, <hi>Cercinea</hi> ſaid unto her, that if they were in the
company of that Shepherd whom they heard talking, it would be impoſſible to
think the time tedious or ill ſpent, and I am confident, ſaid ſhe, when you ſee him,
you will ſay as much as I. But tell me I beſeech you ſaid ſhe, if he be a man, how will
it pleaſe <hi>Dorinde?</hi> who ſays, that if ſhe were one, ſhe ſhould not abide her ſelf. I
do believe, ſaid <hi>Cercinea,</hi> and I dare venture a wager, that when you have ſeen
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> if you do continue your hatred of men, yet at the leaſt you will ſay that
Shepherd is not a man: What ſhould he be then asked ſhe? Somthing more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Cercinea,</hi> and the tryal will but coſt you the time that you ſhall employ in
ſeeing him. He muſt indeed be more then a man (ſaid <hi>Dorinde</hi>) if he force ſuch a
confeſſion from my mouth; For if a God (be it ſpoken without blaſphemy) ſhould
aſſume the ſhape of a man, he would grow near to become ungrateful, and a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and I could not chuſe but hate him.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems (ſaid <hi>Florice</hi>) that you have a very bad opinion of men. Yes, replied
<hi>Dorinde,</hi> and worſe then my words can expreſs; for I do believe that there is none,
no not one ſingle one that can love. You will alter your opinion ſaid <hi>Palinice</hi> when
you ſee <hi>Sylvander</hi> with <hi>Diana.</hi> I cannot tell what I may do, anſwered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> but
I never yet met with any woman who truſted in them, that was not deceived. When
you underſtand, replied <hi>Florice,</hi> how ſome do drown themſelves, ſome baniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and others kill themſelves by reaſon of too much paſſion, you will be very
hard of Belief if you do not confeſs that there are men in this Country that can and
do love. Thoſe reſolutions of which you ſpeak, ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> are indeed very high,
but anger may produce them as well as love, and who knows but that they were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with that Paſſion? for believe it Ladies, Men are of a very bad Nature, they
do all by contraries; they are a kind of Beaſts, which never do any good, but when
they think to do ill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:53527:159"/>
Thus as theſe Shepherdeſſes diſputed, they came to the place where <hi>Sylvander</hi>
was, whom they found ſo plunged in his own ſad thoughts, that for all the noiſe
which they made, he never heard them: he lay all along, his head leaning upon
his hand, his eyes up to Heaven, and upon either cheek a river of tears. <hi>Dorinde</hi>
after ſhe had looked upon him in this condition; Is this the Shepherd (ſaid ſhe in a
low voice), that never deceived any who truſted in him? Why do you ask this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion?
anſwered <hi>Palinice;</hi> becauſe, replied <hi>Dorinde,</hi> if he never did deceive any,
he weeps becauſe he never did: and if he has deceived any, he weeps becauſe he has
deceived no more. This Shepherd, ſaid <hi>Cercinea,</hi> has a better reputation then ſo;
and is held for a very good man: This reputation, anſwered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> is the ſtalking
horſe, by which men come to deceive us. But dear friends, obſerve how a glaſs
ſhews thoſe things which are on the right ſide to be of the glaſs in its left ſide, the
beſt remedy is to do ſo with them; take all that they do or ſay by contraries: and
as for the tears of this Shepherd, aſſure your ſelves my Companions, they are but the
tears of a Crocadile: he can cry and feign, till he has gotten one into a belief of him,
and then he will deceive.</p>
                     <p>Nature to our miſery, has given them power to cry or laugh when they pleaſe,
ſo it be but to deceive a poor woman that puts her truſt in them: they are of a moſt
depraved nature, and are like unto hunters, who make it their delight in taking abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of paines to catch a poor ſilly harmleſſe Woman that flyes before them.</p>
                     <p>The earneſtneſs wherewith <hi>Dorinde</hi> ſpoke, made her raiſe her voice ſo high before
ſhe was aware, that <hi>Sylvander</hi> heard her: and turning her face towards them, he
was aſhamed they ſhould ſo ſurpriſe him in that condition: for ſuch was his warie
diſcretion, that he had rather have dyed, then give them any knowledg of that real
affection which he bare unto <hi>Diana:</hi> therefore to remove all ſuch ſuſpitions, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
himſelf to ſhew them a more contented face, then his heart was; ſo as drying
his eyes as well as he could, and ſeeming to be doing ſomething elſe: Oh Fair Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes,
(ſaid he unto them) how much am I obliged unto you for diverting me
From a melancholy mood. There is none of us, anſwered <hi>Florice,</hi> who are not very
glad to pleaſure <hi>Sylvander</hi> in any thing, and thinks not our walk well imployed ſince
we have met which ſuch a courteous Shepherd: and the rather (added <hi>Cercinea</hi>)
becauſe at the firſt we were afraid, leſt we ſhould be a diſturbance unto you: Oh
never, anſwered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> it is impoſſible but the preſence of ſuch Fair and Lovely
Shepherdeſſes, ſhould bring me all manner of happineſs and contentment: The
poſture in which we found you, replied <hi>Palinice,</hi> made us doubt it: for every
thing will trouble us, when we are troubled our ſelf: <hi>Sylvander</hi> now conceived that
they ſaw thoſe tears which he would have concealed; and to drive them from any
opinion that they proceeded from any Love: It is very hard (Wiſe Shepherdeſſes,
ſaid he unto them) to keep dry eyes, when the ſoul is preſſed with any tormenting
thoughts; for to conſider, that I know neither who was my Father nor Mother,
no nor the ground upon which I firſt breathed, nor to have any eſtate or fortune, or
any hopes but in my own induſtry: are not theſe thoughts enough to draw tears
from the heart of him who is in that miſerable condition? Did I not ſay, replied
<hi>Dorinde,</hi> that they were not tears of Love? Though all my Companions would
needs perſwade me to the contrary. <hi>Sylvander</hi> then looking upon her, and not
knowing her, but ſeeing her to be very Fair, and Lovely: Why Fair ſtranger, ſaid
he unto her, can you diſcern tears of Love from others? Before you ask that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
anſwered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> you ſhould tell me, whether there be any ſuch things as
tears of Love: Nay rather (replied the Shepherd) whether there be any elſe but
tears of Love. Why? ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> do you think one never cryes but for Love? I
do not only think it, ſaid <hi>Sylvander,</hi> but I am ſure you will confeſs it when I have
made you underſtand it; That, ſaid ſhe, can never be, at the leaſt I am ſure, that if
one never cry but for Love, <hi>Dorinde</hi> never cryed; your beauty and your age, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Shepherd, will hardly excuſe you from paying that tribute, unleſs Love
be contented, which make thoſe only cry who do Love you. If ſome muſt cry, replied
ſhe, I had rather the lot ſhould fall upon any other then my ſelf: yet to return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
what we ſpoke of before; be aſſured <hi>Sylvander,</hi> that if none ever cryed but for
Love, then never any man cryed, for never any man neither did, nor will, or can
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53527:160"/>
Love. This opinion, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> is much worſe then the firſt; and if you
pleaſe to give me leave, it ſhall be the firſt that I will make cleer unto you. I am
afraid; anſwered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> you will but loſe your labour, becauſe I have had moſt
certain experience of what I ſay, againſt which no reaſons, nor arguments, be they
never ſo well framed, can prevail or work any effect upon me. But perhaps, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Sylvander</hi>) when we ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> examined your reaſons and experiences by a true
touch-ſtone, you may be convinced of your errour, Upon which, ſhe was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed
with this opinion, that ſhe would needs turn the diſcourſe upon ſome other
ſubject: but her Companions did almoſt force her to hear what <hi>Sylvander</hi> would
ſay, and then the Shepherd began thus.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt all the Doctors in the Maſſilian Schools, I learned this leſſon, never to
diſpute with thoſe that will deny Principles: Tell me therefore Fair Shepherdeſs,
whither you do believe that there is any ſuch thing in the world as is called Love. I
do believe, anſwered ſhe, that there is ſuch a paſſion which is called by that name,
and which men are not capable of. We will not meddle with that yet, ſaid <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
but I am contented that you do confeſs there is ſuch a paſſion which is called
Love. Then tel me I beſeech you, what do you think this Love is? It is, ſaid ſhe,
a certain deſire to poſſeſs that thing which one judges good and beautifull. There is
not a <hi>Druide</hi> in all <hi>Gaul,</hi> replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who could have given a better anſwer
then this Fair Shepherdeſs. But, continued he, and turned towards her, is there not
in the world ſome Animals that have reaſon, and ſome that have none? I have heard
ſay, anſwered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that there are ſuch. And in which of theſe two ranks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> will you place man? You put me to it, (ſaid ſhe and ſmiled) for I
cannot deny but that they are rational in ſome things, and not in others, and moſt
commonly without any reaſon at all. Yet is it not true, (added <hi>Sylvander</hi>) that men
do always ſeek after their delights and contentments? Of this, anſwered <hi>Dorinde,</hi>
there is no doubt: for there is not one of them but will loſe the beſt of their friends,
rather then the leaſt of their delights. I am ſatisfied, replied <hi>Sylvander</hi> then, that you
confeſſe there is a Love, that this Love is a deſire of that which one thinks good or
beautifull: and that men are very earneſt to accompliſh their deſires. Now it will
be an eaſie matter to prove unto you, that men do not only Love, but alſo, that
they do Love better then women. If what I have ſaid, anſwered <hi>Dorinde</hi> preſently,
will help you to prove what you ſay, I will unſay it again: and I had rather be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
with it, then ſuch a falſe concluſion and conſequence ſhould be drawn
from any thing which came from me. All the company began to laugh at this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
and deſired <hi>Sylvander</hi> to continue on, which he did in this manner.</p>
                     <p>There needs not many words, Fair Shepherdeſs, to decide the buſineſs: for it
muſt of neceſſity be concluded, that ſince men have ſuch violent deſires of their
contentment, and the will having nothing but a good for its object, or at the leaſt
eſteemed ſo, it follows by conſequence, that Love being nothing but a deſire, as you
have confeſſed, he does Love moſt, who has moſt objects of good before his eyes;
and the woman being much fairer and fuller of goodneſs then man, who can deny
but that a man Loves better then a woman, who has not ſo worthy a ſubject to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
her deſires upon? I do confeſs all, ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> until you come unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
which you infer: you cannot, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> unleſs you take away that
advantage which women have above men, and therefore it is better for you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that there is none in all the world that knows how to Love ſo well as man: yet
if it happen that any judg the contrary, it is not that the truth is ſo, but is like a
ſtreight ſtaff, which being put into the water, will ſeem crooked; and all that we
ſee through a glaſs, ſeems to be of the ſame colour that the glaſs is: for the Meduim
by which the ſight is conveyed, does repreſent it falſe to the eye: Even ſo it comes
to paſs that the actions of a Lover are ſeen and judged otherwiſe then indeed they
are; and all by reaſon of ſome defect in the Medium, through which they are ſeen.
But the truth is, every man does Love, and this aſſertion is ſo true, as one may
boldly ſay, that all thoſe who Love not, are not men; for there was never any man
that did not Love.</p>
                     <p>Though <hi>Sylvander</hi> was in no fit humour for any ſuch diſcourſe, yet he could not
but ſmile when <hi>Dorinde</hi> anſwered: and when he began to offer other more ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53527:160"/>
he was prevented by the coming of a great company of Shepherds and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes,
who where all returning to their ſeveral homes, as well to dine, as to
paſs away ſome hot hours of the day in the cool ſhade, and therefore he deſired
thoſe Fair Shepherdeſſes to give him leave to retire himſelf for that time. They who
were very deſirous to hear him talk, and had a deſire alſo to reſt themſelves, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Dorinde,</hi> they invited him to their Cabin; but he excuſed himſelf, upon a
promiſe, that when they pleaſed at any other time, he would better explain himſelf
upon this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Upon this leaving them, <hi>Dorinde</hi> after ſhe had conſidered well of him; I muſt
needs confeſs, ſaid ſhe, that if all the men of this Country were like unto <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
when I ſpeak of my hatred unto all men in general, I muſt except thoſe who live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Lignon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time, this great company <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rew neer, and theſe four ſtrangers having
no mind to engage with them, they retired themſelves to their Cabins; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> who deſiring to ſhun all company: he was no ſooner out of ſight,
but he ſate himſelf down under the firſt hedg he came to, &amp; entertained himſelf with
his own new thoughts But his good Genius, who had the care of his conduct, being
not willing he ſhould gangrene his wounds too much by being alone, did conduct all
this great company which he deſired to ſhun, unto the very ſame place where he
was, and ſo opportunely, that when he began his complaints, he was prevented by
their coming; and ſome of them knowing him by ſight, did ſtay all the reſt, to ask him
whether he knew where the great <hi>Druide</hi> was, or elſe where he was that uſed to judg
cauſes in his abſence. The great <hi>Druide Adamas</hi> (anſwered <hi>Sylvander</hi>) is perhaps
at his houſe, which is a remote diſtance from hence, on the other ſide of the River
<hi>Lignon,</hi> upon a little hill, which you may ſee on your right hand as you go to the
great City of <hi>Marſelles:</hi> but the <hi>Druide Cloridamantes</hi> is not far from hence,
dwelling at an ancient Pallace, which is called <hi>Julius,</hi> after the name of him who
conquered <hi>Gaul.</hi> Then all the company entreated him to conduct them thither,
to the end they might have more ſpeedy juſtice upon an injury which had been done
unto all the Shepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and by one whom they had brought along
with them. <hi>Sylvander</hi> hearing this, and caſting his eyes upon the Shepherdeſs that
had been wronged, alſo being much moved as well by her beauty and modeſty, as
by the general offence, he thought himſelf obliged to conduct them, although he
had a great deſire of ſtaying alone, to complain againſt his miſery and diſaſter. He
quitted therefore his ſhady buſh, and went before them to ſhew the way; having
an opinion that if he did otherwiſe, the Gods perhaps would puniſh him for
the offence which others had committed, ſince they had directed this company un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
                     <p>All the way as they went, this great company obſerved a very wary and ſtrict
ſilence; which was no ſmall contentment unto <hi>Sylvander,</hi> for by that means he
could both guide them, and entertain his own ſad thoughts. When they were come
to the houſe, and <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> underſtood that they were perſons who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
reparation of ſome injury which had been done; he came into the great Hall,
where he was wont to do Juſtice unto ſuch as demanded it: and there entred, not
only all thoſe whom <hi>Sylvander</hi> brought, but alſo many others who followed them,
only out of curioſity. <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> was no ſooner entred into the Hall, and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon his Tribunal, but an old Paſtor, holding his wife, almoſt of the ſame age, by
the hand, began to ſpeak thus unto him:</p>
                     <p>Moſt Reverend and moſt Juſt Father, you ſee here before your Tribunal, a Father
and a Mother extreamly grieved and offended by a new way of Proceeding, and by
injuries committed againſt them and their only Daughter, all who come to demand
Juſtice of you: we have brought before you, the offences, the offenders, and the
witneſſes, that when the matter is heard, equity and right may be done according
to your cuſtom, and wicked offenders puniſhed according to their merits.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Druide</hi> then, with ſuch a gravity as became a Judge, aſſured them that the
Scale of Juſtice ſhould be held even betwixt both parties, offences ſhould be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and right ſhould be done unto them all: and to the end, continued he, a more
ſound and juſt judgment may be given, make choice of one amongſt you, who is not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53527:161"/>
intereſted in the buſineſs, who may let us underſtand your difference, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
let each party alledg what they can for themſelves. Then the old Paſtor tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himſelf towards thoſe who came with him, to ſee who amongſt them was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intereſt, and knew all the particulars of the difference: all the company caſt
their eyes upon a Shepherdeſs who came with them: and becauſe doubt was made
whether being a woman the <hi>Druide</hi> would admit of her; yes, yes, ſaid <hi>Clorida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes,</hi>
truth is as good from the mouth of that woman, as from any other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the parties intereſted, do acknowledg what ſhe ſays: and therefore if you think
her able to inform us of the whole matter, we will admit of her: for the innocency
of her age and ſex, will be a ſtrong argument and teſtimony of the truth. By the
command therefore of the <hi>Druide,</hi> and by the election of all parties, this woman
began thus.</p>

                     <p>SInce it hath pleaſed you, moſt Reverend Father, that I ſhould relate unto
you the cauſe of our coming before you, I ſhall do it with as much truth as
poſſibly I can, or you can deſire: and ſince you think a Perſon un-intereſted
is required to be the Relator, I cannot altogether ſay that I am ſuch a one;
for I am a friend unto the parties who are moſt offended: and beſides, I am concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the general injury that is done unto all the Shepherdeſſes of this Country:
but withall I muſt tell you, that what intereſt ſoever I have, my humour is not to
lie, eſpecially in this occaſion, wherein is concerned the life and honour of thoſe
whereof I am to ſpeak; and ſince there is not a Shepherd nor a Shepherdeſs in all
the company, but can relate all the particulars better then my ſelf, I ſhall faithfully
relate all I know: for from my infancy I have been brought up with the young and
Fair <hi>Silvanire,</hi> (ſaid ſhe and pointed to a young Shepherdeſs which ſtood between
an old Paſtor and a Shepherdeſs of the ſame age) and therefore I have been a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to all the paſſages of that Love, from the beginning until now, which is the
cauſe of our now coming before you: ſo that if you would know every circumſtance
which relates unto that buſineſs, none can give you ſo exact account as my ſelf. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
therefore a moſt ſolemn-proteſtation to ſpeak the truth, I ſhall tell you, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Father, that neer this place on the other ſide of the River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> at the
foot of that high and great Mountain, which is called <hi>Mount Luna,</hi> is ſeated that
Village where we inhabit, and amongſt us is a very venerable Paſtor, whoſe name is
<hi>Menander,</hi> (ſaid ſhe, and pointed to him) one that is held of the beſt rank and
reputation, both for his eſtate, and for his wiſdom: This ſage Paſtor being joyned
in marriage many years with <hi>Lerice,</hi> that wiſe and diſcreet Shepherdeſs whom you
ſee next unto him, they never had any teſtimony of their mutual affection, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that Fair and young Shepherdeſs, whom I named before, and who ſtands now
betwixt them. As ſoon as it pleaſed Heaven to beſtow her upon them, all their care
was to ſee her educated in all thoſe virtues which beget eſteem: and nature (whilſt
her Parents were careful in the cultivating of her mind) did imbelliſh her body
with as many graces and beauties, as ſhe was able to beſtow: were ſhe not in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
I ſhould praiſe her more: but ſo it is, that in the ſpring of her age, ſhe grew
unto that height of perfections, that ſhe attracted all eyes upon her, and ſwelled
them with admiration at her beauty.</p>
                     <p>One of <hi>Menanders</hi> next neighbours, and perhaps alſo one of his beſt friends, was
that Reverend old man, whom you ſee upon the other ſide of him, whoſe name is
<hi>Arion;</hi> a Paſtor without reproach, and whoſe Anceſtors have long with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
governed the ſmall buſineſs of our Village. But I muſt tell you, and I hope
he will not be angry with me for ſaying it, that his Father was ſtudious to leave him
more honour then eſtate: ſo that though he was well to live, yet perhaps not ſo
rich as ſome of his neighbours. Some two or three years before <hi>Silvanire</hi> was born,
<hi>Arion</hi> had that young Shepherd to his Son, who ſtands next him, and whoſe name
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53527:161"/>
is <hi>Aglantes,</hi> whom he educated in all commendable qualities. The friendſhip and
good correſpondency of the Fathers, the neerneſs of their dwelling, the beauty of
<hi>Silvanire,</hi> and the inclination, or rather the deſtiny of <hi>Aglantes,</hi> made it a thing
impoſſible for this young Shepherd to ſee her, and not devote himſelf wholly unto
her; and he courted her with a deſign ſo innocent and harmleſs, that none could
but think very well of it. <hi>Silvanire</hi> on the other ſide, ſeeing her ſelf ſerved with
ſo much ſubmiſſion, not knowing yet what Love was, did entertain this Shepherd
with ſuch a childiſh ſincerity, and good will, that neither her Father nor Mother
ſeemed to diſ-approve of it: when <hi>Aglantes</hi> attained to the age of twelve or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years, and <hi>Silvanire</hi> unto nine or ten, they always played in the fields toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſeldom were they ſeen aſunder: and when they returned home <hi>Menander</hi>
and <hi>Lerice</hi> did make ſo much of the little <hi>Aglantes,</hi> that he was more at their houſe,
then at his Fathers. All thoſe that obſerved their actions and behaviour, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
them; the extraordinary indulgence, and continual care of this young Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
in courting this Shepherdeſs, and her ſweet modeſty in intertaining him, was
very ſtrange: If the Sheep of this young Shepherdeſs did at any time go aſtray, he
was never at reſt till he had brought them back unto <hi>Silvanire:</hi> If ſhe chanced to
lye longer in bed any morning then ordinary, he was ſo careful in enquiring of her
health, and in driving her Sheep with his own unto the paſture, that none living
could be more officious and careful: And when ſhe came unto him, he would give
her an account, not only of what he had done, but alſo of every thought, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her to have a care of her health, and leave the care of her flock unto him. One
day, when he brought back a ſtrayed Sheep unto her; Sweet <hi>Aglantes,</hi> (ſaid ſhe
unto him) which way can I requite all this pains you take for me? By permitting
me to ſerve you, anſwered the Shepherd. That payment is eaſily made, anſwered
ſhe; but I fear ſuch coyn is not good enough to ſatisfie ſo great a debt: I do eſteem
that permiſſion which I ask at ſo high a rate, ſaid <hi>Aglantes;</hi> that if I do but obtain
it, I ſhall think my ſelf over payed, not only for thoſe ſervices which I have already
rendred, but alſo for all thoſe which I ſhall or can render: Why do you eſteem
that permiſſion, continued ſhe, at ſuch a rate? becauſe, ſaid he, my higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
and my greateſt ambition, is all my life to be your ſervant. I ſee, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
ſhe, that thoſe ſervants which my Father keeps, do ask other wages then
that permiſſion. Oh Faireſt <hi>Silvanire</hi> (anſwered he) they are not ſervants, but
varlets, drudges, or ſlaves: What difference do you put, ſaid <hi>Silvanire,</hi> betwixt
them and ſervants? They, replied <hi>Aglantes,</hi> are mercenary, and ſerve for money or
fear; but ſervants, ſince all they do is out of Affection and Love; are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
and may rightly be called Lovers, who are fully contented, if their ſervices be
but acceptable to them unto whom they are rendred. I do much wonder then, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the child, why my Father does not rather keep of theſe Lovers, then others;
<hi>Aglantes</hi> could not chuſe but ſmile at this ſimplicity: and though in reaſon, his
age ſhould not make him more knowing in theſe things then <hi>Silvanire;</hi> yet the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which is commonly uſed in talk of ſuch things amongſt boys, more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
wenches, had made him better acquainted with ſuch things then ſhe was:
he ſmiled therefore, and anſwered thus: There is, Faireſt <hi>Silvanire,</hi> abundance of
difference betwixt ſlaves and Lovers, not only in that which I formerly ſaid, but
alſo, in that one may entertain as many mercenary varlets as they pleaſe, but they muſt
never entertain above one Lover; and more then that, none but women can have
them: So then, replied ſhe, ſince you are my Lover, muſt I not entertain any other?
The truth is, anſwered he, that unleſs you do me wrong, you muſt not. I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by my good will wrong you, anſwered ſhe with a ſtrange innocence, but if it
happen ſo that any other ſhould meet with one of theſe Lovers who is ill favoured,
and diſ-agreeable, can ſhe never have any but him? Sweet-heart, anſwered <hi>Aglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
you muſt know, that Shepherdeſſes are not conſtrained to entertain all the Loves
which preſent themſelves; they have liberty to chuſe: but when they have once
made their choiſe, they cannot quit them without ſhewing themſelves, either incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
or weak in judgement; and both theſe reproaches, are ſhame unto a diſcreet and
wiſe woman. Then it ſeems, replied ſhe, that if any of thoſe Lovers do offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto me, I may refuſe them, by ſaying that I have one already.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:53527:162"/>
I do relate theſe trivial particulars, Reverend Father, to ſhew you, at what age
<hi>Silvanire</hi> and <hi>Aglantes</hi> began to Love one another. For ever ſince that time, this
plant ſo grew, that whoſoever offered to cut it up, was doubtleſs puniſhable before
the Throne of Love. But when <hi>Silvanire</hi> was grown a little elder, and old enough
to know the truth of theſe Queries which ſhe put unto <hi>Aglantes,</hi> ſhe learned that
every wiſe woman ought to obey thoſe unto whom ſhe owed her being, and not to
diſpoſe of her ſelf according to her own will, farther then as they approved. And
becauſe this knowledg came a little too late, becauſe Love had already ſowed ſuch
ſeeds, as had taken deep root in her ſoul, and could not be pulled up without abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of ſorrow; ſhe reſolved, ſince ſhe could do not better, to feign that ſhe was
free in her captivity. And though this diſſimulation was a hard task, yet ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her ſelf to have a very great power over her actions. <hi>Aglantes</hi> for four years
together, lived in ſuch incertainty of her good will, that he could not ſay he ever
received any other teſtimonies, then ſuch as might make him think that ſhe held him
in the rank of common indifferency, ſuch as ſhe ſhewed unto all: a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
prudence, for a woman of her age, and certainly not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled.</p>
                     <p>At that time, I began to be familiar with this Fair and Wiſe Woman; and I muſt
confeſs that her virtue, her diſcretion, and her beauty, made me almoſt in Love with
her: and to my great happineſs, I met with a mutual return; alſo I believe, that
upon this, ſhe reſolved to retire in appearance, from that good will which as a child
ſhe had ſignified unto that Shepherd: ſo as by help of this diverſion ſhe was able to
be abſent from him.</p>
                     <p>The cold uſage wherewith ſhe began to entertain <hi>Aglantes,</hi> went ſo to his heart,
that it almoſt ſtruck him dead with wonder to ſee ſuch an alteration: and after he
had filled all our ſolitary places, woods, and caves, full of his complaints; an old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
came unto him when he was in a dark valley, and thinking that none heard him,
he broke out into a thouſand ſad complaints, which might give knowledg unto this
old and experienced Shepherd of his miſery: this old man, being long ſince a friend
unto the Father of <hi>Aglantes,</hi> after he had harkned a while unſeen, he went unto
him, and gave him a very ſharp reprehenſion, telling him he ought not to ſpend
his pretious time in ſuch vain thoughts, but rather in comforting his aged Father,
and looking to his Flocks and Family. That the Gods would puniſh him if he thus
deceived the hopes which every one had in him; that this enemy which kept him in
ſuch ſervitude, was to be overcome by flying; that idleneſs was both the Mother,
and the Nurſe of contempt and want; and repentance would be all the fruit he would
gather from it. But the young Shepherd being ſwelled with his pleaſing paſſion, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
anſwered he, I muſt needs confeſs that thoſe who do Love a ſubject which does
not deſerve it, ought to be blamed and reprehended; and thoſe again who do not
Love that which is amiable, want judgment, and are ignorant: and therefore for my
part, I will cheriſh my affection; and when I ceaſe, my life ſhall ceaſe with it. As
for <hi>Arion,</hi> I hope he will help me to ſupport my torment; I know what filial duty
belongs unto him, and I have ever found his Paternal affection towards me: ſo as I
hope that when he remembers how he himſelf has heretofore paſſed through the
ſame difficulties, he will conſider mine: and as for you Father, who ſhews ſo much
good will in your ſapient admonitions, I do beſeech and conjure you to aſſiſt me
with all your aide and power. <hi>Aglantes,</hi> anſwered the good old man, it is true I love
you, and knowing how hard a thing it is for a young heart to be rid of that paſſion
which you reſent, I wiſh you were free from it, that you might avoid thoſe evils
which may fall upon you, and which I ſee almoſt inevitable: but ſince you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
hearken unto the counſel that I will give. Does ſhe whom you court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be your wife? I know your paſſion will make you tell me wonders of her
merit; but for this time ſetting aſide all partiality, anſwer me if you can, like a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
man, and ingeniouſly tell me who ſhe is, that I may out of my Love to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi>
to you, and your Family, give you ſuch ſound counſel as may be good for you.
<hi>Aglantes</hi> knowing this old man to be a lover of him, and all his Family, did name <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanire.</hi>
The good man, hearing her named, anſwered thus; I muſt confeſs <hi>Aglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
that if you have committed a fault in Loving, you are to be pardoned, and your
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53527:162"/>
crime is commendable: I would yet farther know, whether you ever did let that
Fair one know that you Love her: I have ſpent all my time hitherto in ſerving her, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he; and to my miſery, when ſhe was not in an age to know Love, ſhe ſeemed
as if ſhe did know it, and Love me: but ſince ſhe came to be of age, ſhe ſeems ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
inſenſible: Perhaps, ſaid the prudent old man, ſhe does it to try your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy:
Four years, anſwered <hi>Aglantes,</hi> is too long for a tryal; Does ſhe not Love
ſome other? (asked the old man) The queſtion may better be asked, ſaid <hi>Aglantes,</hi>
whether ever ſhe turn her eyes upon her ſelf: Did you ever give her any cauſe, asked
the Paſtor, to alter her good will unto you? Never that I know of, anſwered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glantes.</hi>
Then ſaid the old man, believe it from me, and aſſure your ſelf, that you
will not repent it; ſhe Loves you, and to diſſemble it, according to the humour of
moſt women, leſt other ſhould ſee it, ſhe will not make it appear unto you. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, ſaid <hi>Aglantes,</hi> that I cannot accuſe her of diſſembling it; for ſhe treats all
others, as ſhe does me, and behaves her ſelf towards all alike: So much the better
(anſwered the old man) for were ſhe engaged unto any other, you would find much
more difficulty in your enterpriſe; but ſhe does diſſemble it, to make you the more
affectionate; knowing that things moſt hardly obtained, are moſt deſired: Oh Father,
(ſaid <hi>Aglantes,</hi> and interrupted) I fear that in this you are miſtaken, for ſhe cannot
wiſh me more affectionate, then ſhe knew I was. Then (ſaid the old man) it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
her Father has commanded her ſo to do; and ſhe being wiſe and virtuous, will
not diſobey him: but be her reaſon what it will, I would adviſe you to make a ſhew
as if you Loved ſome other; for by that, you will know what her deſign is: ſhe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
crafty if ſhe diſſemble it then; and to tell you truly, women are ſomtimes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with being too much loved: as you ſee, there is none but loves light, but too
much light dazles, and we are oft forced to put our hands before our eyes to eaſe
them: I do believe (ſaid <hi>Aglantes</hi>) that this ſtratagem might be good in them that
can act it; but I muſt confeſs, it is impoſſible for me to do it: I ſhould be aſhamed
that any ſhould think me of ſo little judgment, or that <hi>Silvanire</hi> ſhould any way
ſuſpect my fidelity. Oh young man (ſaid the old one and ſmiled) you are a very
novice in the miſtery of Love; the ſhame or the glory of him that attempts any thing,
is to effect it, or not effect it: and if a Lover can make himſelf loved, that is all he
deſires or aims at. For my part, ſaid <hi>Aglantes,</hi> my deſign is to Love her: and, ſaid
the old man interrupting him, to be beloved: To be beloved, replied <hi>Aglantes,</hi> is
above all my hopes. Then Shepherd, ſaid the Paſtor, if you cannot ſeem to Love
another, I would adviſe you however, to let it be reported ſo; for you muſt know,
that theſe young women, though they ſhew the contrary, are not always affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
when they ſmile upon thoſe that court them; but it is more out of vanity, that
it may be ſaid their beauty has gotten ſuch a number of ſervants, and ſomtimes out
of envie at their companions; but be it what it will, it is ſtill very good for him that
Loves, to put them into ſome doubts: and if you be not ſo hardy as to undertake
this enterpriſe, leave the paine of it unto me; and I will effect it for you: it will be
ſufficient for your diſcharge, that when it is a fit time to make known your real affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to ſay that you are not acceſſary unto the ſtratagem.</p>
                     <p>The wiſe old man made it preſently be rumoured abroad that <hi>Aglantes</hi> was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in his affection; and every one was apt to believe it, becauſe <hi>Silvanire</hi> was ſo
cold towards <hi>Aglantes.</hi> But though <hi>Silina</hi> a Fair and Virtuous Shepherdeſs, and
Daughter to this old Paſtor, was reported to be his Miſtris, and that the marriage
was ready to be ſolemnized; yet <hi>Silvanire</hi> would never believe it. 'Tis true, it did
a little trouble her, but not ſo much as to make her alter her behaviour towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glantes:</hi>
for <hi>Menander</hi> her Father had a deſign to marry her unto <hi>Theaner</hi> one of
the richeſt Shepherds in all our Village; and though ſhe did ſcarſe know him whom
they would have her to marry, yet was ſhe reſolved to follow the will of <hi>Menander.</hi>
One day, I chanced to ſurpriſe her, as ſhe was ſaying aloud unto her ſelf, that he
could not change, though he faigned the contrary. <hi>Silvanire</hi> was a little aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
to ſee her ſelf ſurpriſed as ſhe was ſaying ſo: but ſeeming as if what ſhe had ſaid,
was not any thing that concerned her, but only a part of ſome ſong which ſhe had
heard ſome other ſing, ſhe continued talking upon ſeveral other ſubjects: but as
cunning as ſhe was, I ſuſpected that ſhe was troubled at the report of the marriage of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53527:163"/>
                        <hi>Aglantes:</hi> And by fortune, as if that Shepherd came purpoſely to anſwer for his
own innocency, we ſaw him afar off coming with a ſheep before him; as ſoon as
<hi>Silvanire</hi> ſaw him, ſhe knew the Sheep; Yonder (ſaid ſhe) is the man that is to be
married, who it ſeems thinks very little upon it; for yonder ſheep which you ſee, is
the ſame which I loſt this morning. It will be very hard for him, anſwered I, not
to have <hi>Silvanire</hi> alwaies in his memory: But, continued I, what do you conceive
of that marriage? You muſt ask him that queſtion, anſwered ſhe. But replied I,
what do you think of it? I believe (ſaid ſhe) that he never yet thought upon it, and
that he is too young to think of it yet this long time. When I would have replied,
<hi>Aglantes</hi> came to us, who preſenting the Sheep unto <hi>Silvanire,</hi> told her where he
found it, what miſchance it had, and what great care he had of it: The Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs
thanked him kindly, but yet with ſuch a modeſty as might be called coldneſs in
any but <hi>Silvanire:</hi> And becauſe I ſaw <hi>Aglantes</hi> was a little aſtoniſhed at it, though
he was ſufficiently accuſtomed to ſuch uſage, to let him underſtand why my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
uſed him ſo, I ſaid unto him, Have you any mind <hi>Aglantes,</hi> or any permiſſion
to ſerve any other then <hi>Silina? Silina?</hi> ſaid he, and ſtood amazed, why ſhould
ſhe pretend more unto my ſervice then any other Shepherdeſs? Becauſe, anſwered
I, you are ere long to marry her; Do you think to carry it ſo ſecretly that we muſt
not know of it? No, no, ſaid he, aſſure your ſelf that my wiſe is yet unborn: <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanire</hi>
could not chuſe but laugh, and ask him why? Becauſe, ſaid he, ſhe whom I
would have, my own ſmall merits makes me receive a denial; and ſhe who perhaps
I may have, my heart forbids the Banes. But I hope, ſaid I, that when ſhe is born
we may know her, and tell us in the mean time (I beſeech you) what kind of creature
muſt ſhe be that pleaſeth you? If <hi>Silvanire</hi> do command me, anſwered he, I will
tell you. I am very willing (ſaid <hi>Silvanire</hi>) that you ſatisfie my friends curioſity.
Know then <hi>Foſſinde</hi> (ſaid he, and addreſſed himſelf unto me, for that is my name)
that ſhe muſt reſemble <hi>Silvanire</hi> in all things; and aſſure your ſelf, that if ſhe differ
from her in any thing, ſhe ſhall never be mine. Yet <hi>Aglantes</hi> (ſaid I unto him)
let me tell you that <hi>Silina</hi> is a very handſome woman, but ſhe does not at all reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
her: I confeſs, replied he, that ſhe is handſome, and has no reſemblance of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanire,</hi>
and therefore I have nothing to ſay unto her: How? ſaid I, will you not
marry <hi>Silina?</hi> No, no, ſaid he faintly, <hi>Silina</hi> deſerves better then me, but yet though
<hi>Silina</hi> were <hi>Galathea,</hi> and would have me, yet I would have none of her: But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſhe did reſemble <hi>Silvanire,</hi> and were <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſaid I, would you refuſe her?
Though ſhe did reſemble <hi>Silvanire,</hi> ſaid he, yet being <hi>Galathea,</hi> I ſwear by the ſacred
Miſleto, I would not have her.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt we were thus talking, my companion made a ſhew as if ſhe minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the found ſheep, yet I obſerved that ſhe hearkned very attentively unto
us, which made me afterwards look a little more narrowly into all her actions; ſo as
within a few days after, I came to know, that though ſhe made it not appear, yet
ſhe did love him: And truly I cannot but admire the wiſdom of this young Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs,
who at ſuch a tender age had ſuch an abſolute power over her own will.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time <hi>Tirintes</hi> returned into our Village, he is the Shepherd that is
brought before you as a Delinquent, and againſt whom, ſage <hi>Clorimantes,</hi> all this
company demands juſtice: I ſay, he returned into our Town: for though he was
from thence originally, yet was he educated and lived upon the confines of <hi>Furan:</hi>
his Father ſent for him home, and as we all know, very unluckily. When this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
was amongſt us, he no ſooner ſaw <hi>Silvanire,</hi> but he fell in love with her, and
that ſo paſſionately, that many thought him in danger to imitate <hi>Adraſtes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvanire</hi> on the other ſide, whoſe reſolution was upon exact obedience unto
her Father, and had no inclination unto any but <hi>Aglantes,</hi> though ſhe ſhewed it not,
ſhe did diſ-intangle her ſelf from the addreſſes of <hi>Tirintes</hi> with as much diſcretion as
poſſible ſhe could; and though ſhe carried a very great indifferency both towards
him, and towards <hi>Aglantes,</hi> and all the reſt of the Shepherds who courted her,
which was no ſmall number, yet his paſſion did from day to day ſo augment, that he
reſolved, ſince he could not live in her favour, not to live at all. That Shepherd,
oh ſage <hi>Druide,</hi> whom you ſee before you, and whoſe name is <hi>Alciron,</hi> he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
a great lover of <hi>Tirintes</hi> either by reaſon of conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53527:163"/>
believe, out of that drawing ſympathy which makes us love or hate one another:
He ſeeing his friend ſo unprofitably ſpend his time and labour in the courtſhip of this
fair and wiſe Shepherdeſs, he uſed the beſt arguments his Wit would afford him, to
diſſwade him from it; and at this time finding him in ſuch a deſperate humour, alſo
ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ng no hopes of his cure, he reſolved upon one of the boldeſt pieces of wickedneſs
that can be imagined.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tirintes</hi> had that day driven his Flock almoſt upon the tip of Mount <hi>Luna,</hi> as well
becauſe he would be out of ſight, as to have the more cool Ayr for his ſheep; and
perhaps this laſt reaſon made <hi>Alciron</hi> to go thither a little before; <hi>Tirintes</hi> not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, ſits down under a Fir-tree, ſeemed for a while to be immoveable, his eyes
fixed upon ſome certain Rocks which were cloſe by; and at laſt fetching a moſt deep
ſigh, <hi>Alciron</hi> heard him utter many ſad complaints againſt the obduracy of his
Miſtris, comparing her unto thoſe Rocks, and his eyes flowing with tears.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as he had ended his ſad complaints, it was not long before <hi>Alciron</hi> would
needs help him to condole: oh my dear <hi>Tirintes</hi> (ſaid he unto him) how long will
this moſt lamentable life laſt? Are you not weary with ſhedding ſuch Rivers of
Tears, and raiſing ſo many winds of unprofitable ſighs? Do you not know how all
your labour and pains is unfruitly loſt? Is not Hope it ſelf (which ſeldom leaves a
Lover) quite vaniſhed? Is it poſſible that with the loſs of thy liberty, thou ſhouldſt
alſo loſe the uſe of thy reaſon? If thou haſt thy wits, when wilt thou make uſe of
them? Muſt they be alwaies unprofitably idle? Doſt thou think any ſervice will ever
oblige yonder Shepherdeſs? Will any Tears mollifie her? Will any pains move her?
Or will any Affection or faithful obſtinacy win her? Oh <hi>Tirintes,</hi> if thou art in
that error, how groſly art thou miſtaken? She is deaf, and abſolutely inſenſible to
all manner of prayers, or ſervices, or tears: She is ſtark blind, Man land cannot ſee
any of thoſe pains and paſſions which thou doſt endure for her; and what canſt
thou ever expect in any reaſon from ſuch a deaf and blinde ſoul, but that ſhe ſhould
neither hear, nor ſee, nor reſent any thing? Oh ye Gods! replied <hi>Tirintes,</hi> what
would ye have me to do? Command me what you pleaſe, I am here ready to obey
you in all, but only in bidding me ceaſe to love her. In this, I beſeech you pardon
me if I diſobey; for the fault is not mine, but that all-commanding Beauty which I
have not power to reſiſt.</p>
                     <p>He had long continued his complaints, if <hi>Alciron,</hi> who could not endure to ſee
his friend in ſuch torment, had not interrupted him, with intentions to give ſome
comfort. The Gods <hi>Tirintes</hi> (ſaid he unto him) do know our weakneſs and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and out of their infinite goodneſs, will excuſe and pardon them: But they
will not endure the crime of thoſe who will make them guilty of their own errors:
Therefore, dear friend, Do not by any ſuch blaſphemies provoke their juſt anger
againſt thee. Oh my dear friend, replied <hi>Tirintes</hi> with a deep ſigh, ſince they do
know our imbecilities and imperfections, and will pardon them, doubtleſs they will
not impute that crime for which you reprehend me, for it is weakneſs only which
makes me commit it; proteſting, that my intention was not to tranſgreſs their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
but when I could not obey them. And to make it appear that it is ſo,
good <hi>Alciron</hi> tell me, who is he that can love ſuch a moſt amiable piece leſs then I do?
And in loving her ſo paſſionately, who can blaſpheme leſs then I, if it be blaſphemy
to ſay that I cannot chuſe but love her? Oh <hi>Tirintes,</hi> replied <hi>Alciron,</hi> Do not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thy ſelf in thine own fault, for this paſſion which you ſay is ſo potent in thee, is
indeed only thy own Will, which if thou wouldeſt ſurmount, thou haſt power enough
to do it. I do confeſs (ſaid <hi>Tirintes</hi> coldly) that it does depend upon my own will:
But do you not ſee that I cannot will any thing but what ſhe pleaſe? So then it ſeems
ſaid <hi>Alciron,</hi> you will ceaſe to be a man, that you may become a Lover. If being
a man, ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> be not to love <hi>Silvanire,</hi> I neither am, nor will be a man. Not
to make uſe of Reaſon, replied <hi>Alciron,</hi> is not to be a man; and can there be any
thing more unreaſonable then to ceaſe loving ones ſelf, to love another? Is not ſelf
preſervation the great and principal law of Nature? Oh dear friend, ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi>
let me not ſee the greatneſs of my wound; I hope it is not incurable: but you take
the courſe to make it more deſperate: But the ſtone is thrown, it is reſolved upon,
that I will die in loving <hi>Silvanire;</hi> and be aſſured, that I wiſh for nothing now, but
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53527:164"/>
to end this life quickly; for here I hope for no mitigation of my pain. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you <hi>Alciron</hi> to promiſe, that when I am dead, you write this Epitaph upon
my Tomb, <hi>Here lies he that was murdred by the Faireſt Eyes under Heaven:</hi> I hope,
that one day this cruel Fair One, will in theſe few words read my affection, and her
own cruelty, and the Gods to my ſatisfaction move her unto ſome repentance. Oh
how happy ſhould I be, if in the other life I hear one ſay that her Fair Eyes was once
wet, or that one ſingle tear did trickle down her Fair Cheek: Fie, fie, <hi>Tirintes,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Alciron,</hi> why this talk of death and Tombs? Love is the God of life, and nothing
can ruine his empire but death: Live, live man, though it were for nothing but to
preſerve a faithful Lover for this <hi>Silvanire</hi> whom you Love ſo well: and for my part,
I will promiſe you, that if you will follow my directions, and do as I bid you, I will
quickly give this Fair One unto you. Oh <hi>Alciron,</hi> ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> impoſſible promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
never oblige thoſe unto whom they are made; this which I do promiſe, replied
<hi>Alciron,</hi> is no impoſſibility, provided you will but do as I ſay: then he continued thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tirintes</hi> (ſaid he) I deſire as much as I do my own life, to ſee you rid of this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
paſſion; but ſince I ſee all perſwaſions are in vain, I promiſe to give you
this woman, in a very ſhort time; ſhe ſhall be ſo much your own, that it ſhall be
long only of your ſelf, it you do not diſpoſe of her according to your own will: do
not think it a thing impoſſible, for you ſhall preſently find it effected, and confeſs
that I never promiſed, but I performed. In order to this, within a few days after, he
came unto him again, and brought him a Mirrour, in which he forbad him to look;
and aſſured him, that if by any artifice he could ſo contrive it as <hi>Silvanire</hi> might
caſt her eye upon it, certainly ſhe were his own, How? ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> is it an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment?
No, anſwered <hi>Alciron,</hi> but it is a natural power, which is in this
glaſs; and what effects will it cauſe? asked <hi>Tirintes.</hi> Nay, nay, ſaid <hi>Alciron,</hi> be not
too inquiſitive; be contented ſhe ſhall be yours. And what? ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> will
ſhe Love me? Still too much curioſity, anſwered <hi>Alciron,</hi> can you not be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that ſhe ſhall be yours? But <hi>Tirintes,</hi> take ſpecial heed that neither you nor any
other whomſoever, look into it; for the conſequence will be very bad: and if you
ſhould before you are aware, caſt your eye upon it, come preſently unto me, that I
may remedy the fault which you ſhall commit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tirintes</hi> took this Mirrour with much contentment and thanks, and to loſe no
time, went preſently unto <hi>Silvanire,</hi> unto whom he preſented the glaſs with many
ſupplications ſhe would be pleaſed to take it. And becauſe ſhe made ſome queſtion
whether ſhe ſhould receive it from him; as thinking it not handſome, for any maid
to take any thing from a young Shepherd, without the knowledg of her Parents, he
preſſed her with ſo many humble entreaties, and arguments of perſwaſion; that at
laſt, ſhe would give him that ſatisfaction; but upon condition, that ſhe would keep
it no longer then ſhe pleaſed. So after ſhe had looked in it, and much commended
it, ſhe gave it him preſently back: he who ſaw his deſign was attained, he preſſed
her no farther, but was well ſatisfied that he had done as <hi>Alciron</hi> appointed him:
but his contentment laſted but a while; for preſently after, <hi>Silvanire</hi> was taken
with ſuch a giddineſs in her head, and ſuch a drowſineſs, that ſhe fell a ſleep, and
they could not awake her, ſhe was troubled above three hours in this manner, and
none knew her diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The noiſe preſently ran about the Town, that this Fair One was poiſoned, and no
hopes of life left in her: you may imagine that <hi>Aglantes</hi> and <hi>Tirintes</hi> did run with
ſad hearts to ſee what the matter was: but as ſoon as <hi>Tirintes</hi> ſaw her in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he knew it to be an effect of the Mirrour, which made him ſo extreamly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
againſt <hi>Alciron,</hi> that had he met him, doubtleſs he had dyed for it. This villain
(ſaid he to himſelf) deſigned her death, to deliver me from the affection which I
bare unto her: but cruel wretch that he is, he never conſidered that my life depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon hers, and that when ſhe dies, it is impoſſible for me to live: O thou moſt
inhumane Tiger! Couldſt thou find a heart to hurt this Fair One? Who never
thought thee the leaſt hurt? Certainly, the blackeſt fiend in Hell was thy Nurſe and
gave thee ſuck: but Barbarian, thou ſhalt receive a death by no other hand but my
own: Oh <hi>Tirintes, Tirintes!</hi> Canſt thou know who did this damned act, and live
or breath without revenge?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:53527:164"/>
This Shepherd in this mind, went as faſt as ever he could to ſeek <hi>Alciron,</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with ſo much fury, that had he met him, he had never told who hurt him:
In the mean time <hi>Silvanire</hi> grew worſe and worſe, and none looked for any thing
but death. Amongſt thoſe that were in the Chamber, and who, ſadly reſented this
loſs, was the ſad <hi>Aglantes,</hi> whoſe grief was ſo great, that he ſwooned almoſt as ſoon
as ſhe. <hi>Menander</hi> alſo and <hi>Lerice,</hi> whoſe hopes and comfort was in this Fair Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſeeing her in this ſad condition, they repented that they had lived ſo long, and
accuſed the Gods of cruelty, in beſtowing ſo many rare endowments upon <hi>Silva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi>
and depriving them of her ſo ſoon; all eyes that ſaw her in this ſtate, were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into tears in ſuch abundance, that nothing could be heard but ſighs, groans, and
great lamentations. At the laſt, ſhe being in extream agony, and not looking to
live, ſhe forced her ſelf to ſpeak thus unto her Father and Mother, who ſtood ſighing
and ſobbing by her bed ſide.</p>
                     <p>Father, ſaid ſhe, I am afraid, leſt the Gods ſhould be offended at your exceſſive
ſorrow for my death; you know better then I call tell you, that life is not more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
then death; and thoſe who begin to live, begin it with a condition to dye:
why then ſhould you be ſorry, that I am now ready to pay that debt, which all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
are obliged to pay unto death? Perhaps you are ſorry the Fatal Siſters have
ſpun the thred of my life no longer, and your good nature makes you deſire, that
as you preceded me in life, ſo you might in death: But Oh my dear Father, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how good and wiſe the Gods are; who foreſeeing the miſerable condition of a
young woman that is deprived of Father and Mother, they would not leave me in
this wicked world without a guide: if you do but conſider this favour which they
do me, you will acknowledg it to be the greateſt they ever gave me. But perhaps
you will complain, that having taken ſo much care, and beſtowed ſo much coſt in
my education, I ſhould now be taken from you, when I am beſt able to render you
thoſe ſervices which I ow. I muſt confeſs, that if any conſideration can move me
to deſire longer life, it is this; for it is a kind of ingratitude not to deſire the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that debt which I ow: at this word, her pain forced her to ſtop, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a little ſtrength, and ſhe gave leiſure unto all that heard her, to admire her wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and courage, thinking her to reſemble a Candle, which gives greateſt light at
the laſt end: this conſideration forced ſo many ſighs and tears, from all that heard
and ſaw her, as they were not able to ſpeak; ſo as when ſhe had recollected a little
ſtrength, ſhe ſpoke again unto <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Lerice</hi> in this manner.</p>
                     <p>I have many things to ſay, but my end which I perceive approacheth, does hinder
me; only I beſeech you both, my dear Father and Mother, to conform your ſelves
unto the divine will of God: and aſſure your ſelves, that I ſhould depart from hence
more contentedly then ever I lived, were I but eaſed of two burthens, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
oppreſs me. <hi>Menander</hi> then forcing himſelf to ſpeak, diſcharge your heart
my deareſt child (ſaid he unto her) and aſſure your ſelf, that as never Father had a
better child then I, ſo never child had a Father who loved her more then I do you.
This permiſſion (ſaid <hi>Silvanire</hi>) is the only thing that can make me leave this life
with contentment; which ſince you are pleaſed to allow, I ſhall tell you Father and
Mother alſo, that I was extreamly troubled, having received ſo many favours and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
from your goodneſs, and having been hitherto ſo unhappy in my return of
that ſervice which I ow unto you both, as I ſhall grieve in my very ſoul if your good
natures does not make it appear, that you accept my good will, and deſires, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of ſo many infinite ſervices which I ow. Then <hi>Menander</hi> kiſſed her, and
with flowing eyes ſaid, your good deſires, ſweet child, are accepted far above the
duty or ſervice which you ow: great God be praiſed, ſaid ſhe, but alas, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
my ſelf wholly? Indeed beſt Father and Mother, I want courage, and muſt
ask a new permiſſion, or elſe I cannot. <hi>Lerice</hi> and <hi>Menander</hi> alſo, and all that heard
her, could not forbear their ſighs to ſee her pain, and their admiration to hear her
ſpeak, even when every one judged her to be at the laſt gaſp; all that were about the
bed preſſed <hi>Menander</hi> to give her a ſpeedy permiſſion, which he freely did, and
then <hi>Silvanire</hi> fetched a deep ſigh, and lifting her eyes up to Heaven to ſhew her
extream contentment, and forced her ſelf to utter theſe weak words.</p>
                     <p>You have both of you ſo often taught me, that ingratitude is the moſt deteſtable
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53527:165"/>
vice amongſt humanes, as I think the Gods would never forgive me, if I preſented
my ſelf before them, ſtained with that horrid ſin. Therefore I cannot hide the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
contentment which this your permiſſion brings me; ſince by it, I may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
waſh away the crime, but alſo the thought that I was guilty of it. Then taking a
little breath, and ſtriving againſt the violence of her diſeaſe, ſhe continued thus:
You ſee (ſaid ſhe and pointed at <hi>Aglantes</hi>) that Shepherd who ſtands at my beds-feet,
and who ſeems to reſent my ſickneſs ſo ſadly, be pleaſed moſt dear Father
and Mother, to know, that ever ſince the infancy of our days, he has had ſo great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to me, that perhaps not any about the River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> can equal him, and
yet all this while, I do proteſt, I never could obſerve in him, the leaſt action or word
that could offend the moſt modeſt maid upon earth; but the great Gods who know
my actions, my words, and my moſt ſecret thoughts, are my witneſſes and judges,
whether in all this time I ever let this Shepherd know that his amity and affection was
pleaſing unto me. And yet <hi>Aglantes</hi> do not think that any ſcorn was the cauſe of
it, for I know you deſerve better then what you deſire: but it was only the duty of
a maid, as I am, which conſtrained me to uſe you ſo.</p>
                     <p>Upon this word, feeling her ſelf extreamly in pain; Oh death! (ſaid ſhe with a
deep ſigh) I beſeech thee ſtay a little longer, and give me leiſure to end that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
which I began. Then taking a little breath; Oh <hi>Aglantes,</hi> ſaid ſhe, though I
have been brought up in theſe Woods, and amongſt wild Rocks, yet am I not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
as they: your Virtue, your Love, and your Diſcretion, did work that effect
in me which you deſired; but knowing that my Father had a deſign to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> me other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then with you, and being reſolved never to diſ-obey my Parents, I reſolved alſo
never to let you know that good will which I wiſhed unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
all thoſe incivilities, and diſcourteſies which you have erceived from me. But
now, ſince the Gods, who are all goodneſs and wiſdom, have by my death untied thoſe
knots which tyed my tongue, as ſince thoſe who have the power over me, do give
me leave: Know friend, that never was any greater affection conceived in the heart
of any human, then the affection which <hi>Silvanire</hi> does bear unto you. And that I
may be cleerly purged from that ingratitude, wherewith I might be charged, give
me a little farther leave, Oh my moſt dear Parents; which they permitting, and ſhe
thanking them; ſhe haſted to utter theſe words: Alas! (ſaid ſhe) I can do no more.
Then holding out her hand unto the Shepherd, ſhe ſaid unto him; here <hi>Aglantes,</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet I will die the Wife of <hi>Aglantes;</hi> and as the laſt favour I ſhall ever ask,
or you give, O moſt honoured Parents, I beſeech you conſent unto it.</p>
                     <p>The Father who had another deſign, would not have been ſo forward if he had
thought ſhe would have lived; but thinking her even dead, he thought it good to
let her die contentedly: and indeed he had no ſooner conſented, but ſhe turning her
head gently towards her Shepherd: Oh Gods! (ſaid ſhe) I die, but <hi>Aglantes</hi> I die
thine: Upon this word ſhe grew ſpeechleſs, and lay as dead in the arms of <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and <hi>Lerice.</hi> To relate here all the lamentations and cryes of the Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and principally of <hi>Aglantes,</hi> I conceive it not pertinent; for it will eaſily be
imagined they were extream: but ſo it was, that they were forced to take them oft
her, even by plain force, and carry them away, for grief did enrage <hi>Aglantes:</hi> &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the occaſion of ſo much ſorrow, they intended to bury her out of hand, without
any Pomp or Solemnity; and had according to the cuſtom embalmed her, had not
<hi>Alciron</hi> prevented them, who told them that it was not humane to bury people,
eſpecially of her quality, before they were quite dead, at the leaſt quite cold:
ſo as upon this, they left her without pulling off her clothes, in this ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tirintes</hi> on the other ſide, he was in raging queſt of <hi>Alciron,</hi> that he might open
his breſt, and pull out his heart, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e revenged for the wrong he had done
him; and afterwards with the ſame ſword, ſacrifice himſelf upon the Tomb of this Fair
One. And doubtleſs if he had met him, he had done ſo, though he was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
friend he had: but the Prudent <hi>Alciron,</hi> he went to him in bed, becauſe he
feared the anger which <hi>Tirintes</hi> might conceive againſt him. At the firſt when <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rintes</hi>
ſaw him enter, he rouſed out of bed to run upon him; but <hi>Alciron</hi> holding
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53527:165"/>
the door half open half ſhut; <hi>Tirintes</hi> ſaid he unto him, can you poſſibly imagine,
that he who loves you the beſt of all the world, ſhould ever deprive you of that
which you hold moſt dear? And yet cruel Tyger, ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and interrupted him,
the Fair <hi>Silvanire</hi> is dead. <hi>Silvanire,</hi> replied <hi>Alciron,</hi> is alive, and I will die the moſt
cruel death your rage can invent, if I do not put her into your hands alive, and well,
within this hour, if you will let me go where ſhe is. <hi>Tirintes</hi> all amazed at this, is
not <hi>Silvanire</hi> dead? ſaid he, and did not you cauſe her to be let in the room by her
ſelf? It is true (anſwered <hi>Alciron</hi> and ſmiled) but ſhe is left there for you; Oh good
Gods! <hi>Alciron</hi> (ſaid <hi>Tirintes</hi>) <hi>Silvanire</hi> to be dead, and to be for me are two things
that cannot hold together. I confeſs, replied <hi>Alciron,</hi> that they cannot; but to be
alive, and be yours may: Surely, ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> you do deceive me: why ſhould I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you (ſaid <hi>Alciron</hi>) or indeed how can I, when I offer, if you will go with
me, to put her into your hands alive and well the ſame hour? And if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
why ſhould I come unto you? You ſee I do not ſhun you, nor fear meeting
with you. Come, come, ſet your mind at reſt; dreſs your ſelf, and come with me,
and you ſhall preſently ſee what I ſay punctually performed. But prethee tell me,
ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and ſhrugged his ſhoulders, can you fetch ſouls back after they be
once waſted over the Stigian Lake? Will <hi>Charon</hi> ſuffer that? No, no, I cannot (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Alciron</hi>) but <hi>Tirintes</hi> know moſt aſſuredly that <hi>Silvanire</hi> is not dead, but by
a ſecret virtue of nature, which is in that glaſs which you had of me, ſhe is ſo ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that every one thinks her ſo. Oh Heavens, cryed out <hi>Tirintes,</hi> what wonders
do you tell me? I tell you nothing but truth (replied <hi>Alciron</hi>) and to ſatisfie your
wonder, and perplexity, know <hi>Tirintes,</hi> that the glaſs is made of a Stone, called
the <hi>Memphitique Stone,</hi> which has a virtue to ſtupifie the ſenſes ſo extreamly, that
as ſoon as it is touched by the eye, it preſently takes away the underſtanding: And
unto this Stone is added ſome of the bones of a Fiſh, which is called the <hi>Torpedo,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by ſuch art, and concocted together, that as the <hi>Torpedo</hi> benums the arm of
the Fiſher, when it touches the hook that is faſtned to the line; ſo alſo as ſoon as
the eyes are touched by this glaſs, they receive a poyſon ſo ſubtile, that firſt ſeiſing
upon the brain, it dilates a general ſtupifaction all over the body, as every one
would think it dead. Now <hi>Tirintes,</hi> judge whether I have not reaſon to complain
againſt you, who ever found my extream affection flowing towards you; and yet
can think I would offer ſuch a mortal diſpleaſure: what advantage could you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
I could draw from the death of this woman? If it be ſo, ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and went
neerer him, you were to blame Shepherd in that you did not acquaint me with it:
By that, replied <hi>Alciron,</hi> you may better know that I do love you; for did I not
know Shepherd, that thou neither wouldeſt nor couldeſt live after thou wert depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of <hi>Silvanire,</hi> and couldeſt thou hope ever that thy ſervices or thy merits could
gain her? I know, that having but that only remedy, thou wouldſt never have
uſed it, if I had acquainted thee with all the effects of it: conſider ſeriouſly with your
ſelf, and anſwer me; ſhould I have told you, that as ſoon as ever <hi>Silvanire</hi> did look
in the glaſs, ſhe would fall into ſuch extremity of pain, as ſhe would fall down like
dead, and being ſo judged by all that ſee her, they will embowel her, and put her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her grave: anſwer me I ſay <hi>Tirintes,</hi> durſt you have executed ſuch an enterpriſe
upon her? No, no, I know what power a perſon that loves hath, to make any ſuch
attempts upon the party Loved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tirintes</hi> hearing this, and knowing that <hi>Silvanire</hi> was not dead, he held out his
arms, and went to embrace <hi>Alciron,</hi> with ſuch abundance of contentment, that he
was almoſt ſpeechleſs; but recovering himſelf, he asked a hundred pardons for the
anger which he had conceived againſt him: and dreſſing himſelf as faſt as ever he
could, he beſeeched him to conduct him unto the room where <hi>Silvanire</hi> reſted, to
the end that ſhe who was the life of his ſoul, might not remain any longer in the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
of death. But dear friend, continued <hi>Tirintes,</hi> by the way as they went, when
<hi>Silvanire</hi> is taken out of the vault, (for you muſt underſtand that they had carried
her out of the Town into one) How do you mean ſhe ſhall be mine? Yours? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Alciron,</hi> who will take her from you? Does not every one think her dead?
And when ſhe is in your hands, who will ask her of you? Oh <hi>Tirintes, Tirintes!</hi>
learn how to make uſe of the time preſent, as well as I do: and if you do not, blame
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53527:166"/>
not me, but your ſelf. With ſuch diſcourſe as this they came to the place where
the Vault was; where the ſtone being preſently taken away, <hi>Silvanire</hi> was found in
the ſame condition they left her, at which <hi>Tirintes</hi> was extreamly aſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>niſhed for all
the aſſurances of life which <hi>Alciron</hi> gave him. But to ſee the wonderful qualities
and effects of ſome things which Nature doth produce; as ſoon as ever <hi>Alciron</hi> threw
a little water which he had in a little Bottle, into her face, and rubbed her pulſe and
temples, ſhe ſhewed ſome ſignes of Life; ſhe began to breath, and preſently after
ſhe perfectly waked. Then ſaid <hi>Alciron</hi> unto <hi>Tirintes;</hi> Here Friend, I give you
<hi>Silvanire,</hi> I have performed my promiſe, and make uſe of your Fortune and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity:
Upon this he left them alone together, as thinking that he had no more
to do with them.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Silvanire</hi> opening her eyes, and finding her ſelf in that place, and at that time,
for it was hardly day, ſhe was the moſt aſtoniſhed woman in the world; for ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
all that had paſſed very well: but ſhe could not imagine how ſhe ſhould
come out of the Tombe: ſo as remaining a while in her aſtoniſhment, and ſeeing
none by her but <hi>Tirintes;</hi> Shepherd (ſaid ſhe unto him) I pray tell me what miracles
are theſe? Faireſt <hi>Silvanire,</hi> ſaid he, I can tell you no more, but that they are the
ordinary effects of your Beauty. But <hi>Tirintes,</hi> replied ſhe, have not I been dead?
and, am I not now alive? You are not only alive, replied he, but can give life unto
whom you pleaſe. If I was dead, added <hi>Silvanire,</hi> how came I to be alive again?
who was able to bring me back from the Stygian Lake? One that is ſo fair as <hi>Silva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi>
anſwered the Shepherd, cannot ſtay in ſo foul a place. This is flattery, ſaid
the Shepherdeſs, but pray <hi>Tirintes</hi> tell me ſeriouſly, was I not dead? and am I not
now alive? Dead you never were I am ſure ſince I knew you, ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> for you
were alwaies alive in my heart. The truth is, the affection of <hi>Tirintes</hi> unto you is
ſuch, that when death was ready to triumph over you, I changed death into ſleep,
and afterwards, that ſleep into the condition wherein now you are. Your affection
replied <hi>Silvanire,</hi> changed my death into ſleep, and that ſleep into the condition
I now am in? How could you do it? For my part I muſt confeſs I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tirintes</hi> who had no mind to ſtay any longer in that place, leſt he ſhould be found
by ſome who might mar all the plot before him, he thought it beſt to deal plainly,
and tell her truly the whole paſſage. Know therefore <hi>Silvanire</hi> (ſaid he) that to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your curioſity, after I had loved, ſerved, and adored you with infinite devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and found all to be in vain, I had recourſe unto Art. Do you remember a
Glaſs which I beſeeched you to take from my hand? I do remember it very well an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwered
ſhe, for I never had my health ſince. That Glaſs, ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> was of
ſuch a compoſition, that as ſoon as any did look in it, they were preſently ſurprized
with ſuch a ſtupifaction and lethargie, that they would ſeem to be dead: The ſame
operation it had upon you; and they laid you in this Vault, from whence I now
come to take you out. Oh Heavens! cryed out <hi>Silvanire,</hi> How dangerous all men
are? But what was your deſigne in ſo doing? My deſign was, anſwered he, to do
as I did, that is, to make all believe that you were dead, and afterwards to live the
reſt of our days together in ſome place where none might trouble us. Oh <hi>Tirintes</hi>
ſaid ſhe, and ſhook her head, could you ever imagine I would conſent unto it? I
thought (ſaid he) that an obſtinate ſervice might ſurmount your obſtinate rigour. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
(anſwered ſhe) which is not pleaſing, is always in vain. Love, replied he, did
put me into that hope. Love, anſwered ſhe, is never the Author of ſuch Treaſon;
and that you may find the truth of what I ſay, Love will ſo puniſh your treaſon,
that you have quite loſt all the hopes of my being ever yours; you are much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Shepherd in your deſigns, for <hi>Silvanire</hi> is not her own to diſpoſe of if ſhe would.
How, ſaid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> not <hi>Silvanire</hi> her own, unto whom is ſhe given? She is his,
replied the Shepherdeſs, unto whom you have given her, which is, unto <hi>Aglantes.</hi>
Who I? replied <hi>Tirintes,</hi> Did I ever give you unto <hi>Aglantes?</hi> Yes, anſwered <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanire,
Tirintes</hi> did give me unto <hi>Aglantes:</hi> Hearken and I will tell you how:
<hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Lerice</hi> my parents, did intend to marry me unto the Shepherd <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes:</hi>
And the truth is, by my good will I would never marry any but <hi>Aglantes;</hi>
Death is more welcome to me a thouſand times, then to be the wife of any other:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53527:166"/>
yet I was ſo fully reſolved never to fail in my duty to my Parents, that <hi>Aglantes,</hi> nor
any other, ſhould never make me fail in my obedience to them. Now being in this
extremity of pain, your artifice did obtain that for me, which otherwiſe I never
durſt ask; The poiſon in your glaſs proved my happineſs: So as when every one
did think me dead, Love did inſpire me to ask my Parents conſent to beſtow my ſelf
upon <hi>Aglantes,</hi> in gratitude and reward of his long and faithful ſervices: They ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me in great pain, did give me free leave to diſpoſe of my ſelf; upon which I
took <hi>Aglantes</hi> by the hand, and declared my ſelf to be his wife: Therefore <hi>Tirintes,</hi>
your hopes are all blaſted, and it is in vain for you to attempt any further. Come,
come (ſaid <hi>Tirintes</hi> in a great rage) <hi>Menander, Lerice,</hi> and <hi>Aglantes</hi> alſo are dead
unto you, as you are to them. Upon this he offered to take her by the arm, and
carry her away: But the Shepherdeſs with a greater confidence then the place could
allow her, did ſtoutly defend her ſelf againſt his violence; ſomtimes by perſwaſions,
otherwhiles oppoſing force againſt force, and ſomtimes flying. But ſhe ſeeing him
paſt all reſpect, and that her flight and reſiſtance was in vain, ſhe was conſtrained to
cry out: As Fortune was, <hi>Aglantes</hi> came in upon her voice, who (as I underſtood
ſince) was looking for the Tomb of that Shepherdeſs, that he might there end his
days: When he ſaw her firſt, he had an opinion that it was ſome deluſion of his
Fancy; but afterwards, knowing him to be <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and hearing her voice, he
knew that ſhe was alive whom he thought to be dead: and fell into ſuch an extream
paſſion, that he fell furiouſly upon <hi>Tirintes;</hi> ſo doubtleſs one of them had ended
his days, (for they were both extreamly incenſed) had not a great number of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
come in and parted them; and who ſeizing upon the miſerable <hi>Tirintes,</hi> brought
him hither before you, oh ſage <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> to be puniſhed according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his offence.</p>
                     <p>But all theſe that came in the company, did not come upon the ſame cauſe; for
the joy and contentment of <hi>Menander, Lerice,</hi> and <hi>Aglantes</hi> was ſo great, that they
would willingly have forgotten the injury, or at the leaſt would have diſdained all
revenge. But their coming is to have judgement upon another difference which
hath hapned ſince.</p>
                     <p>Be pleaſed to know therefore, oh Reverend Father, That this great Tumult being
appeaſed, and <hi>Tirintes</hi> in the hands of thoſe who have brought him hither, <hi>Aglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
full of joy to ſee the fair <hi>Silvanire</hi> riſen from the dead, or to ſay better, born
again, addreſſing himſelf unto <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Lerice,</hi> he beſought them both that
they would be pleaſed to conſummate his happineſs by a concluſion of this ſo much
deſired marriage, as thinking that the delay of ſuch a happy union could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
unto any. <hi>Menander</hi> at the firſt ſtood a while mute, ſeeming as if he heard
not; but <hi>Aglantes</hi> ſeconding his firſt deſire with moſt earneſt ſupplications, he took
notice that <hi>Menander</hi> walking about the room with his hands behind him, he mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo as none could underſtand him, or as if he was deaf on that ear; but he went
ſhaking his head, as it is uſual for one to do that would deny a requeſt. This ſilence
and this action did exceedingly ſurprize <hi>Aglantes;</hi> for he thought his marriage ſo
ſure, that when he ſaw the old man make a doubt of it, he firſt grew pale, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
was taken with an extream trembling. Many of the Shepherds that were
in the room wondering at the ſilence of <hi>Menander,</hi> and his way of proceeding,
they drew nearer, and ſeeing <hi>Aglantes</hi> in that condition, to wit, almoſt beſide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
they feared that if <hi>Menander</hi> did not keep his word, ſome fatal accident would
befal his houſe; therefore gathering about him, they beſeeched him not to trouble
their great joys, by ſuch an alteration as appeared to be in him: But <hi>Menander</hi> not
ſo much as giving them a look, he walked ſtill on, and held his eyes fixed upon the
ground. Friends (ſaid he unto them at laſt) New matters, new reſolutions. How,
replied <hi>Aglantes,</hi> New matters, new reſolutions? What do you mean by that?
My menning is, replied <hi>Menander,</hi> That when I promiſed my daughter unto yon,
I thought her dead, and ſo I am contented ſhe ſhould be yours; But now, ſince
(thanks be to heaven) ſhe is alive, I mean to diſpoſe of her another way. <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
(anſwered <hi>Aglantes</hi>) you have already given your Daughter unto me, her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſents unto it, and <hi>Silvanire</hi> would have it ſo: I have accordingly taken her,
I conceive her to be mine, and none can take her from me, but they muſt take away
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53527:167"/>
my life alſo. Your life (replied <hi>Menander</hi>) is nothing unto me; but my Daughter
is my own, and none can take her from me; you cannot pretend unto her by vertue
of my promiſe; for if promiſes oblige, <hi>Theantes</hi> may better claim her as his, becauſe
I made a promiſe unto him long before any to you: Therefore <hi>Aglantes,</hi> if you
have a mind to marry, you may do well to look for a wiſe ſomwhere elſe. Oh ye
good Gods (cryed out <hi>Aglantes,</hi> ſtamping his foot againſt the ground, and ſtriking
his hands together) Oh heavens! oh Earth! is there any Juſtice amongſt men? Is
it not beyond the bounds of any patience to endure ſo great a wrong.</p>
                     <p>All the Shepherds who heard them talk thus, fearing (and with reaſon) ſome
great diſaſter if this diſpute went any further, they gathered themſelves together, and
were of opinion that the beſt courſe was to preſent themſelves before you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſuch judgement as in your prudence you ſhould think moſt fit in ſuch a caſe. It
was not without much ado that they conſented unto it; for <hi>Menander</hi> thought it an
undervaluing himſelf and his daughter; and <hi>Aglantes</hi> could not endure a thing ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his due, ſhould be ſo much as diſputed, or put unto the arbitriment of men: yet
at laſt, by the mediation of friends and kinred, they were perſwaded to ſubmit unto
whatſoever ſhould be ordained by you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Foſſinde</hi> had no ſooner ended, but <hi>Menander</hi> tranſported with rage, and not
ſtaying till the <hi>Druide</hi> gave him permiſſion to ſpeak; he ſtood up, and in a loud voice
began thus: I do demand Juſtice, Oh ſage <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> againſt the inſolency of
this age; which would take away from a Father, that power which nature hath given
him over his child: I do conjure you to maintain, that which all Laws ordains, all
cuſtoms obſerve, and all the world approves of: I demand no novelties, ſince from
the beginning of time, Fathers have uſed to diſpoſe of their own children: I require
nothing but what is juſt, ſince nothing is more equitable then for every one to be
the Maſter and Lord of his own workmanſhip: and I require nothing but what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to natural ſence and reaſon, ſince it is reaſonable, that thoſe whom a grave
experience has preferred above others, ſhould be believed and obeyed, in what they
adviſe and appoint. The whole diſpute reſts upon this ſingle point, whether a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may not diſpoſe of his child as he will: If the negative, then I have loſt my cauſe;
but then I would adviſe all Fathers, never to care for having any children, nor to
trouble themſelves with giving any education unto them, ſince they are not their
children, but their companions nay, their Maſters; if the Proverb be true, which
ſays, <hi>Have a Companion, and have a Maſter.</hi> Then will the Father, who is Lord
Paramont in his little Republique, be outed of his Dominion by him whom he bred
in his own boſom; Oh moſt depraved age! I have ſeen the time when if a child had
in the leaſt circumſtance diſ-obeyed the command of a Father, he had been hiſſed at
in the ſtreet, and pointed at by every finger: but now, it is grown wit to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer;
it is courage and ſpirit to ſlight commands, and it is duty in a child to uſurp
authority from the Father. The name of Father, ſage <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> does ſignifie
abſolute Lord and Soveraign Maſter of his child. This being ſo, I am moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that you honour the Gods ſo far, as to maintain my Title and Prerogative
over this young Daughter which is mine, and whom I have brought up with ſuch
abundance of care, coſt and paines. For my part, I will uſe no other argument but
this, ſhe is my Daughter; if ſhe be mine, I may diſpoſe of her as I pleaſe. If the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of her be taken from me, It muſt alſo be declared that ſhe is none of mine:
and if I may diſpoſe of her, I do give her unto the Shepherd <hi>Theantes,</hi> according to
my promiſe long ſince made unto him: of this, <hi>Aglantes</hi> cannot complain, becauſe
he has no right but what he claims by promiſe; but if my promiſe oblige, then that
promiſe which I made firſt unto <hi>Theantes,</hi> has much more ſtrength and validity in it,
by reaſon of precedency: and therefore I conclude, that, Oh <hi>Aglantes,</hi> if you have
any deſire to marry, you muſt ſeek ſomewhere elſe for a wife.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Menander</hi> ended, and <hi>Aglantes</hi> offered to anſwer, but becauſe <hi>Silvanire</hi>
thought that his paſſion perhaps would make him over ſharp in his argument, ſhe
pulled him by the arm and interrupted him, beſeeching <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> to appoint
ſome other to anſwer for them, whoſe ſpirit was leſs poſſeſſed with anger and chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler;
for elſe, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Aglantes</hi> in the heat of paſſion, may utter ſomthing which
may diſpleaſe <hi>Menander. Cloridamantes</hi> admiring the diſcretion of this young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53527:167"/>
man, and impoſing ſilence upon <hi>Aglantes,</hi> he looked amongſt all the Company
for one that ſhould ſpeak in his behalf; and after he had veiwed them all, he made
choiſe of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> to anſwer <hi>Menander,</hi> and plead thoſe reaſons which <hi>Aglantes</hi>
could alledge. The Shepherd would gladly have excuſed himſelf, becauſe he was
in no good humour: but thinking it a crime to refuſe any thing the <hi>Druide</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
he undertook it: ſo after he had required a little time to conſider how he
ſhould frame his Arguments, he began thus:</p>
                     <q>
                        <floatingText xml:lang="unk">
                           <body>
                              <div type="speech">
                                 <head>The anſwer of Sylvander, in behalf of Aglantes
and Silvanire.</head>
                                 <p>THE weight which you lay upon me, Oh wiſe <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> is a little too
heavy for my weak ſhoulders to bear: for it is not a light matter to ſpeak
in this place, or to undertake the cleering of the duty from a child to the
father, or the authority of a father over his child: there are few here
who are not intereſted, either as a father, or as a child; and to hold the ballance ſo
even, as it ſhall not lean more on one ſide then another, is not a thing ſo eaſie as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
may perhaps think it. Do not think <hi>Aglantes,</hi> that if by the command of this
Reverend <hi>Druide,</hi> I do undertake to anſwer <hi>Menander,</hi> it is any way to maintain,
that children are not obliged to obey their parents; God forbid I ſhould utter ſuch
a word, for all our ſervices and all our obedience that we can render unto them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
acquit us of that duty which we ow unto them: neither would I have <hi>Menander</hi>
think that if I do declare the exact obedience of children to their Parents, I do infer
thereby as you do, that the Father has power to do what he will with his child. 'Tis
true, the Gods have named them Fathers, but has not made them abſolute Lords of
men; but it is rather to ſhew the love that the Gods do bear unto them, becauſe
nothing can more reſemble it then the love of a Father to his child; and to teach
men that they ought to ask all things that are neceſſary for them, and expect them
from their goodneſs. For that tyrannical authority which you ſuggeſt, is not that
which Fathers ought to have over their children; that does too much reſemble the
authority of a Maſter over his ſlave: there is a vaſt difference between a child and a
ſlave. 'Tis true, a Father ought to be obeyed in all things; but ſtill with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,
that the Father do command as he ought, and according to reaſon: for a child
is more obliged to obey reaſon, then any one that can command him; for it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which gives him a ſoul, and makes him different from irrational animals: and
this ſoul is it which gives him his very being. A man, <hi>Menander,</hi> is compoſed of a
ſoul and a body; the body he has from his Father, but that is common with all brutes:
The ſoul he has from God, and this ſoul is rational: conſider now, whether a man
be obliged more to him that gives the body, or to him that gives the ſoul; I think
then you will conclude with me, that a child is not bound to obey the command of
the Father, if the command be againſt reaſon; for in ſuch a caſe, his obedience would
be a ſin: and therefore I ſay, Fathers have no ſuch abſolute power as you imagine,
nay perhaps they have no power at all, if they go beyond the bounds of reaſon: 'Tis
true, the child ought not of himſelf to judg whether the commands of the Father be
juſt or unjuſt, or unreaſonable, unleſs they be ſo apparently groſs that common
ſence will ſhew them ſo, but if the child do at any time doubt, he ought alwayes
to incline towards the obeying ſide, and that he think his Father more wiſe and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to judg then himſelf, until thoſe who are conſtituted judges, do determine
and declare it otherwiſe. Now, the caſe which is preſented before you at this time,
Wiſe <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> is of this nature; for here is <hi>Menander,</hi> who is not willing that
<hi>Silvanire</hi> ſhould marry <hi>Aglantes,</hi> but would have her marry another Shepherd; ſhe
who is wiſe, and knows how far the name of daughter does oblige her unto obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
ſhe preſents her ſelf before you, to know whether the command be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
or no: It is you, Wiſe <hi>Druide,</hi> that muſt ſet down the Law unto her, for ſhe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53527:168"/>
is ready to obey it; the reaſons of <hi>Menander</hi> are that abſolute power which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
unto over his child: that the promiſe which he made unto <hi>Aglantes,</hi> does not
oblige him for two reaſons; the firſt, becauſe he promiſed <hi>Theantes</hi> before: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that though he did promiſe her unto <hi>Aglantes,</hi> yet it was when he thought
his daughter would dye that ſame hour. The reaſons of <hi>Silvanire</hi> and <hi>Aglantes</hi> (for
they are inſeparable) are, that the promiſe which he made unto <hi>Theantes,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
conſented unto by <hi>Silvanire;</hi> and her conſent unto <hi>Aglantes</hi> was not only in the
preſence of <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Lerice,</hi> but alſo by their permiſſion, conſent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that the eſſence of marriage conſiſts principally in the will of the two parties
who do marry, and therefore reaſons tels her that ſhe is more obliged to perform
this laſt promiſe, then that which <hi>Menander</hi> made unto <hi>Theantes,</hi> unto which ſhe
was never privy, though had ſhe been called, ſhe would have conſented. As to that
point of <hi>Menanders,</hi> that his intention was not to ſuffer this marriage, but only
becauſe he belived his daughter would dye the ſame hour; <hi>Aglantes</hi> anſwers, that
contracts are never made by thoughts, but by words: for thoughts are not to be
dived into.</p>

                        <hi>Sylvander</hi> would have proceeded, when <hi>Menander</hi> tranſported with extream
impatience, did interrupt him: But upon the firſt word he uttered, <hi>Cloridamantes</hi>
commanded him to be ſilent, and <hi>Sylvander</hi> alſo, when he offered to continue his
diſcourſe, telling them, that the caſe was well enough underſtood, and therefore
there needed no more time to be ſpent. At the ſame inſtant <hi>Theantes</hi> deſired audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and in a loud voice ſaid, Oh wiſe <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> there is no greater folly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sun, then to love without any hopes of ever being loved again; and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is a moſt miſerable torment when it is not tyed with mutual and reciprocal knots,
and therefore I conclude and declare, that <hi>Silvanire</hi> may marry, but never <hi>Theantes:</hi>
Upon this he made an humble reverence to the <hi>Druide,</hi> and the Aſſembly, and went
his way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> then roſe up to ask the opinion of other <hi>Druids,</hi> and to give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the caſe; But <hi>Tirintes,</hi> who could not with any patience endure to hear
that <hi>Silvanire</hi> ſhould be given unto any other, he ſaid with a raging voice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
eye, Who is he that does accuſe me? and why am I kept here a priſoner?
<hi>Foſſinde</hi> then began to ſpeak; Wicked Shepherd, ſaid ſhe unto him, Dare you be ſo
impudent as to ask why you are kept here, or who will accuſe you? Does not your
own conſcience tell you, that never was a greater malefactor brought before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
of any Juſtice? Does not every thing, every circumſtance accuſe you of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Infidelity? The Heavens that ſee you, the Earth that bears you, Trees,
Men, Gods, and all things, oh perfidious and miſerable Shepherd, do accuſe you,
and call for vengeance upon your crime.</p>
                     <p>Every one wondered to hear <hi>Foſſinde</hi> give ſuch tart language; for there was very
few in the whole aſſembly who did not know that ſhe loved <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and though
unfruitfully, yet had done long; ſo as to ſee her now thus exaſperated againſt him,
it ſeemed much againſt the ſtream of her long continued cuſtome, and it was ſtrange
that her extream affection ſhould ſo ſoon change it ſelf into ſuch an implacable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
as ſhe would have made him loſe his life. But <hi>Tirintes</hi> ſtood ſtill, and without
any alteration in his countenance, Speak (ſaid he) unto the Judges if you have any
charge againſt me, it is they from whom you muſt have juſtice: Do you think I have
not courage enough to abide all your objections? <hi>Foſſinde</hi> bluſhed at theſe words,
and turning towards <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> ſhe beſeeched him to ſit down again, and hear
what ſhe could ſay; and then ſhe began thus.</p>
                     <p>This impudent Shepherd, oh wiſe <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> who is brought before you, is
the moſt worthy of death of any man that lives; he ſays he loves <hi>Silvanire,</hi> but who
believes him? Nay, who can believe him if they conſider his actions? Moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he never knew the power of Love, though to excuſe himſelf, he would caſt all the
fault upon that God. For what are the effects of love? To ſerve, to honour, nay
even to adore the perſon that is loved: But what witneſſes does this wicked Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
give of his affection unto <hi>Silvanire?</hi> In lieu of ſerving her, he gives her poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
he cauſed her to be buried alive, and ſuffer intollerable torments; in lieu of
honouring her, he would have blaſted her reputation, and made her the moſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53527:168"/>
Shepherdeſs that lives: if theſe be the effects and conſequents of Love, I dare
ſay that Love has changed its Nature: But haply he will be apt to ſay, that theſe are
meer impoſtures, and aſperſions caſt upon him, and that he did never commit any
ſuch crimes. Sage <hi>Druide,</hi> here is the wicked man, he cannot deny it, his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
flies in his face, and ties his tongue: The truth is, his vilany is ſo great, that it
is hard to find words to excuſe it under the umbrage of a Lover, or with any gloſſes
of affection and fidelity: To give poyſon unto a poor innocent woman ſo ſubtilly
couched in a glaſs, what excuſe under heaven is there for ſuch a black horrid inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
He cannot gloſs it over with an excuſe of ignorance, nor ſay that <hi>Alciron</hi> did
not tell him the effects of it; for it is moſt infallibly certain, his intention was to make
her die, and be revenged upon her for loving another, or at leaſt, for having no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
unto him: But ſeeing his deſign fruſtrated, perhaps by the ſtrong conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Silvanire,</hi> which reſiſted the poyſon, or as it is moſt probable, by the Will
of God, who would not deprive the world of ſo fair, ſo wiſe and ſweet a woman,
to excuſe or extenuate his crime, he muſt pretend that his intention was only to caſt
her aſleep. But oh ſage <hi>Druide,</hi> I beſeech you ask the good <hi>Menander, Lerice, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glantes,</hi>
and all thoſe that ſaw her in the Agony ſhe was, whether in any ſleeping
fits they uſe to have ſuch cruel pain, ſuch convulſions, ſuch contraction of Nerves,
and ſo many ſymptomes of inevitable death; and then judge whether it was not a
moſt mortal poyſon, which the Gods by a miracle made ineffectual to his intentions.
But this cruel Barbarian, not being ſatisfied with her death, but he would alſo with
the ſame cruel eyes ſee her in the Tomb, to glut his cruelty; and finding her revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he never offers to ask a pardon, but would carry her into ſome deſolate place,
God knows where, and certainly, but for the relief of thoſe Shepherds which came
in upon her cry, he had executed his moſt wicked deſigne. Judge now, juſt <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantes,</hi>
whether in all this there be the leaſt ſhadow of any Love: Conſider, that
if ſuch a Treaſon as this paſs unpuniſhed, there is no ſafety for any Shepherdeſs to
live in Forreſts; How can we guard our ſelves againſt ſuch violences? I beſeech you
therefore let us dwell ſafely in our houſes, and quietly in our fields; and make this
man exemplary, by inflicting ſuch ſevere puniſhments, as may be a terror unto others.
Thus ſpake <hi>Foſſinde,</hi> who after a low congie unto the <hi>Druide</hi> and the reſt of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
ſhe fate down in her place. Every one were aſtoniſhed to hear this tart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
<hi>Tirintes</hi> only ſtood un-amazed; for having loſt his hopes of <hi>Silvanire,</hi> he
valued not his life: But making a ſigne that he deſired to ſpeak, and the <hi>Druide</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
him, he anſwered thus.</p>
                     <p>This Shepherdeſs, moſt wiſe <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> is in the right, when ſhe ſays that I
have done ill; but ſhe is in the wrong, when ſhe accuſes me of a crime unto which
I never conſented, but am as innocent as her ſelf: No, no <hi>Foſſinde,</hi> I refuſe not one
of thoſe torments or puniſhments which are prepared for me, and which I know are
my due; I will not excuſe my ſelf, for I cannot; and aſſure your ſelf, that though
I could, I would not: But bitter and malicious Shepherdeſs, Why ſhould you add
falſe crimes unto crimes that are true? You had no reaſon in the earth for it; for
thoſe which I have committed, are ſufficient to glut your ſoul, be it as cruel as it can
be. Oh <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> the affection which I bear unto the fair <hi>Silvanire,</hi> is too
great to make me think of any ſuch impieties as <hi>Foſſinde</hi> falſly charges me: It is true,
I did give poiſon unto the Fair one, but it was becauſe I was deceived by the words of
him whom I could not ſuſpect to have any ſuch thoughts. Let the fair <hi>Silvanire</hi> tell
you how ſhe found <hi>Alciron</hi> and me about her, when ſhe awaked, with a Bottle of
Water which we caſt in her face to awake her. All thoſe of <hi>Menanders</hi> houſe can
teſtifie, that it was <hi>Alciron</hi> who hindred that Faire One from being embalmed, leſt it
ſhould have hurt her: Oh <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> Could I but be declared innocent of this
impoſture, I would willingly confeſs all the other crimes which are charged upon me,
I value not the torments of death a ruſh, ſo my love and my fidelity be preſerved
pure and innocent, for them do I extreamly deſire to carry with me unblemiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the other world.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſpoke <hi>Tirintes,</hi> leaving all the Auditory raviſhed at his reſolute alacrity and
pittying his miſ-fortune: <hi>Alciron</hi> who could not endure to ſee his friend thus at the
ſtake, and himſelf the author of the crime: Sage <hi>Druide,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Tirintes</hi> is not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53527:169"/>
only cleer and free from any guilt againſt <hi>Silvanire,</hi> concerning the glaſs which I
gave unto him, but alſo from all the conſequents of it: for firſt, though the glaſs
be broken, yet the pieces are to be ſeen, and eaſily tryed whether the compoſition
be mortal poyſon, or only of a ſtupifying quality. It is compounded of ſuch ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
as <hi>Foſſinde</hi> hath named: here are the pieces, and tryal of them if you pleaſe
may be made; then he pulled out his handkerchief wherein he lapped them up, when
<hi>Tirintes</hi> in anger againſt <hi>Foſſinde</hi> broke it. Every one turned away their eyes, leſt
they ſhould be tainted by the virtue of this Stone, and <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to put it up; no, no, ſaid he, I cannot believe that either you or <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rintes</hi>
had any ſuch abominable intention; becauſe it is an act ſo extreamly horrid,
as it cannot be imagined it ſhould enter into the thoughts of any in this Country:
but if you have any thing to ſay which will quit <hi>Tirintes</hi> of the violence which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
unto this Shepherdeſs, you may ſpeak it before all this Aſſembly. Then <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
offered to ſpeak as to that, when <hi>Tirintes</hi> interrupted him; Peace, peace, friend,
ſaid he unto him, for I will dye; and happy is he that dyes who cannot live happily.
Yet I thank thee hartily for thy good will, and evidencing that it was not my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to make <hi>Silvanire</hi> dye, whoſe life I beſeech the Gods preſerve to eternity. But
for all this, the affection of <hi>Alciron</hi> made him begin to ſpeak; yet he had no ſooner
uttered the firſt word, but <hi>Tirintes</hi> interrupted him again. Oh ſage <hi>Druide,</hi> ſaid
he, it is only compaſſion upon his friend, and not the truth, which makes him ſtrive
for ſome arguments to defend me, for my part, I diſavow what he ſays, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you not to believe him, but to do Juſtice according to the Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> then, after he had impoſed ſilence upon <hi>Alciron</hi> and the reſt, he
aroſe from his ſeat, and went to gather the voices of the other ſeven <hi>Druides;</hi> for
when the life of any one was in queſtion, they were to call that number at the leaſt
to aſſiſt them. The time which he imployed in taking their votes, was very long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was ſome difference of opinions concerning the judgement. <hi>Tirintes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſolved to dye, ſince he had no hopes to obtain <hi>Silvanire,</hi> all delay was tedious
unto him: <hi>Aglantes</hi> and <hi>Silvanire,</hi> who thought the pain no leſs then a death to
be ſeparated one from the other, they expected the iſſue of their enterpriſe with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
impatience: at the laſt, the <hi>Druide</hi> after a long diſpute and debate of the
matter, came and took his ſeat; then pronounced theſe words.</p>

by the Great <hi>Tautates,</hi> by <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and by all the order of <hi>Druids</hi>
and <hi>Cavalry,</hi> to do Juſtice in this Country of the <hi>Seguſians;</hi> after a full
hearing of the difference that is betwixt <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Lerice</hi> of the one part, and
<hi>Aglantes</hi> and <hi>Silvanire</hi> on the other: and alſo of the accuſation preferred againſt
<hi>Tirintes</hi> for an attempt againſt <hi>Silvanire,</hi> after a long ſolemn and ſerious debate, and
conſideration of the premiſes, We do Sentence and declare, that a Father and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
have by the Laws of God and Nature, all that power and authority which can
be had over free perſons; and that their children in this quality cannot diſobey them
without offence againſt Laws both divine and humane: but withal, we Sentence and
declare that children are not born ſlaves, but free: for otherwiſe it were a ſhame for
Fathers to get none but ſlaves; and it would be a moſt miſerable blemiſh to the
Country, that it of all <hi>Gaul</hi> ſhould produce none but people of ſuch vile quality: for
theſe cauſes therefore, and for many other juſt and good conſiderations us thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

contract be but with conſent of both parties that are to tye themſelves together with
that holy knot: and that the rigour and compulſion of Fathers in ſuch caſes, be
held as tyranny, and be null. Upon theſe grounds this contract betwixt <hi>Aglantes</hi>
and <hi>Silvanire</hi> is declared to be firm and indiſſolvable, all due circumſtances and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
being obſerved. And furthermore, as in Juſtice to <hi>Tirintes,</hi> ſince, ſlights,

                     <p>The faces of all the Company were full of great joy, and of great ſorrow at this
Sentence; <hi>Aglantes,</hi> and <hi>Silvanire,</hi> and their friends, ſeeing their marriage was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
according to their wiſhes, their joyes were tryumphant: on the other ſide,
abundance of Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes grieved for poor <hi>Tirintes;</hi> for he was a
very kind and courteous Shepherd, and ſuch an accident had not hapned of a long
time.</p>
                     <p>So as every one was very ſorry for him, and blamed <hi>Foſſinde</hi> for her bitter and
malicious accuſation. <hi>Tirintes</hi> himſelf was the only one who ſeemed not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at it: for he received the Sentence of death with a ſmiling and contented coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
and turning towards <hi>Silvanire,</hi> Shepherdeſs, ſaid he unto her, I hope
that now you are contented, and indeed ſo ſhould I be, if I did but go out of this
world with a pardon from you: <hi>Tirintes</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him with tears in her eyes)
if your life were in my power, as well as a pardon, be aſſured you ſhould live many
years: for I do not only pardon, but pity you; and ſhall grieve for you as long as I
live. Then <hi>Tirintes</hi> kneeled down upon the ground, and moſt hartily thanked her
and ſaid, that he ſhould be more happy in his puniſhments, then ever he was in his
ſervices.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Foſſinde</hi> ſeeing her deſign did hit according to her wiſh, ſhe
went unto <hi>Tirintes;</hi> Shepherd, ſaid ſhe unto him, It joyes my ſoul to ſee you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
unto this point which I have ſo long and ſo much deſired: and I, ſaid <hi>Tirin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
am alſo very glad my death will give you ſo much contentment, and I ſhall
leave the world without any rancor or malice in my heart. Oh <hi>Tirintes, Tirintes!</hi>
(ſaid ſhe unto him) you ſhall know ere it be long, that I am as free from any malice
or rancor as you, and that my own life is not ſo dear unto me as yours: alas, all
that I have done is only out of the exceſſe of my love; then addreſſing her ſelf unto
<hi>Alcas</hi> her Father; Father, ſaid ſhe unto him, you promiſed that you would very
willingly give me leave to chuſe my Husband; moſt true, anſwered <hi>Alcas,</hi> and I will
perform it, for I do not approve of the humour in Fathers to be tyrannical towards
their children. Then addreſſing her ſelf unto <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> and the other <hi>Druide.</hi>
Oh ſage and juſt Judges (ſaid ſhe unto them) you have according to the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<hi>Tirintes</hi> to die: and by the ſame Law, I do demand him for my Husband,
and by that means, free him from that puniſhment, unto which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                     <p>Upon this all the Aſſembly ſhouted, and clapped their hands in ſign of joy, and
ſaid with an univerſal voice, Thanks, thanks. Then did all the friends of <hi>Tirintes</hi> run
to imbrace him, and rejoyce with him. Every one commended the good act of
<hi>Foſſinde:</hi> for it was a Law moſt religiouſly obſerved, that if any woman came to
demand a condemned perſon for her husband, he ſhould be delivered unto her.
<hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Lerice,</hi> only looked but half contented, and could not conſent unto
the marriage of <hi>Silvanire;</hi> but ſeeing the publique joy, and <hi>Aglantes</hi> upon his knees
with <hi>Silvanire,</hi> at their feet, their anger began to cool, and they imbraced both <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glantes</hi>
and <hi>Silvanire</hi> with a joyful countenance, and confirmed the Sentence of the
<hi>Druides.</hi> Then all the Aſſembly rejoyced: and <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> who by the force of
the Laws had condemned <hi>Tirintes,</hi> was very glad of ſuch an occaſion to deliver him;
and therefore cauſing ſome Chaplets of Flowers to be brought; he firſt put two
upon the heads of <hi>Silvanire</hi> and <hi>Aglantes;</hi> and afterwards turning towards <hi>Foſſinde,</hi>
here Shepherdeſs (ſaid he unto her) take this which I put upon your head, and I
leave the other in your hands; give it unto <hi>Tirintes,</hi> for a teſtimony that you have
given him both his life and <hi>Foſſinde.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Shepherdeſs rendred moſt humble thanks for the favour, and ſaid, I do take
this which you have given to me, and put it upon the head of <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and I do
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53527:170"/>
take his, and put it upon my own, in witneſs that we will never be ſeparated. And
now, ſince ſuch an univerſal joy was unexpectedly fallen upon them all, it was
thought fit to go into the Temple, and thank the Gods: And ſince the impatience
of theſe two Lovers were very great, it was reſolved upon, that they ſhould then be
married, and the reſt of the ceremonies be performed afterwards, when they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their homes. But <hi>Sylvander</hi> who could not endure to be amongſt ſo many
joyful and contented perſons, after he had received many thanks from <hi>Aglantes</hi> and
<hi>Silvanire,</hi> he left the company, and went into the Woods to lament his own miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

to ſee <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſo as (ſaid they that did advertize them) unleſs you make very
great haſte away, aſſure your ſelves ſhe will be before you, which if ſhe be, you muſt

ſuch diverſions; oh God, good Servant, ſaid ſhe, let us not ſtay her coming, for
we ſhall not be rid of her all the day; and if I be in ſo long a conſtraint, I ſhall moſt
infallibly be ſicker then I was in the morning: <hi>Aſtrea</hi> laughed to hear her ſay ſo:
Dear Miſtris (ſaid ſhe) command, and be obeyed: I think it beſt, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi>
to take our own habits, and go to meet her: This motion was no ſooner made
then executed, and the more ſpeedily, becauſe <hi>Diana</hi> who conducted them, did

ſhe knew how to cover it diſcreetly.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Florice</hi> ſaw theſe Shepherdeſſes afar off, ſee <hi>Dorinde,</hi> ſaid ſhe, how cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
the fair <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is, who knowing your coming, prevents you in civility, and is
coming to meet you. I ſhould be aſhamed, anſwered ſhe, that all thoſe diſcreet
Shepherdeſſes ſhould take ſo much pains for me, but I muſt confeſs I have an extream
deſire to ſee them. Since it is ſo (ſaid <hi>Circinea</hi>) and if you would not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loadned
with curteſie, let us go as faſt as we can to meet them, to the end they may
know, that if you had known their deſigne, you would not have put them to that
trouble. Upon this, the four ſtrangers taking hands, they went as faſt as they could
towards theſe fair Shepherdeſſes, who received them with ſuch free expreſſions and
teſtimonies of good will, that <hi>Dorinde</hi> could not enough admire them, both for their
Beauty and their Civility. <hi>Alexis</hi> alſo was not a little in their eſteem, who knew
how to play the woman ſo well, that not one of her actions did belye that name:
and becauſe <hi>Dorinde</hi> obſerved that every one did bear a great reſpect and honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Druide,</hi> ſhe thought it becoming her to do the ſame; ſo as addreſſing her
ſelf unto her, Madam, ſaid ſhe, one of my wiſhes is accompliſhed, for I have very
long deſired to ſee <hi>Lignon,</hi> and all thoſe Beauties about it; and I ſee heaven is very
favourable to my deſires, in letting me ſee the beſt firſt. I confeſs, ſaid the <hi>Druide,</hi>
that when you ſee <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> you have ſeen the glory of <hi>Lignon,</hi>
which heaven hath favoured above all the Rivers in <hi>Europe;</hi> and there is none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
theſe whom ye ſee before your eyes. Theſe commendations (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>)
which it pleaſes the fair <hi>Druide</hi> to beſtow upon us, are teſtimonies of that honour
which ſhe confers upon us by her love; my companions and I do receive them upon
that account, though they be much above our merit: But fair Shepherdeſs, I would
not have you deceived by them; leſt that belief ſhould cauſe you to eſteem leſs of the
Shepherdeſſes of <hi>Lignon;</hi> for do not think, that though thoſe you ſee here have no
great matter of Beauty to boaſt of, that the reſt are the ſame, aſſuring my ſelf, that
when you ſee them, you will confeſs that they do not deſerve contempt: As for us,
we beſeech you to love us, not in the quality of fair, but of good, and as thoſe that
do highly deſire the honour of your favour, and are ready to pay thoſe duties of
Service and Civility unto you, which by the cuſtome of our Country, and your own
merits we are obliged unto. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> (ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> for I know that is your name by
the luſter of your Beauty) I ſay fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I do think the pains of my journey to be
highly recompenced by the very ſight of you, and I find my ſelf beyond all meaſure
ſatisfied, when I conſider your fluent curteſie and civility; but let me tell you, that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53527:170"/>
I am infinitely aſhamed in not being able to requite it. Their complements had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
longer,, if <hi>Florice,</hi> who was much offended by the too much luſter of the
Sun which ſhined full upon them, had not interrupted; wherefore ſhe beſeeched the
<hi>Druide,</hi> and the reſt of the Shepherdeſſes, to honour her ſo far as to ſhade themſelves
under her Cabine, which was cloſe by the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> and ſhaded with ſeveral
leave-ſpreading trees; ſo as the motion being accepted, they went that way, to
ſpend part of the day under thoſe ſhady trees, till the heat of the day was a little
over.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diana</hi> remembring the promiſe which that ſtranger made, of telling her the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of her hatred unto men, and finding her ſelf in a good humour, Fair Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs
(ſaid ſhe after they were ſet) we have a cuſtome amongſt us, that we eſteem all
promiſes to be due debts: we do hold the obligations as firm, and reckon upon the
payment, as certainly as if it were indented and ſealed; and therefore I beſeech you,
do not think it ſtrange that I ſhould in the preſence of this good company ſummon
you to the payment of that debt which you owe unto me; and I conceive that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
your promiſe, the time, and the place, and every thing does invite you to it.
Although (anſwered <hi>Dorinde</hi>) I were not obliged by my promiſe, yet ſhould I be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ready to pay obedience unto any thing you ſhall either command or deſire; I am
ſorry for nothing, but that what I ſhall tell you, will not be worth the time that
will be ſpent in hearing: Yet ſince it is your command, I had rather fail in obeying
you, then in not ſatisfying your deſires. Then after a while of ſilence, ſhe began
thus.</p>

                     <p>IT is with great reaſon that learned Phyſicians ſay, Interior diſeaſes are moſt
dangerous, and difficult to be cured, becauſe the ſight cannot reach them, they
know by conjectures only what they are: The heart, and the moſt noble parts,
are more eaſily infected, and ſooner ſeized upon, then thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us. The diſeaſes of the ſoul, are the ſame with the diſeaſes of the body; and
thoſe which do proceed from things without us, are much leſs dangerous then thoſe
which are from within us. I do call thoſe things which are without us, Riches, the
favour of others, health, ſickneſs, and briefly, all things upon which Fortune has a
Soveraign Authority: And I do call thoſe things which are within us, every thing
that does depend upon our own wills, and within the power of our own ſouls: For
it is but little hurt that Fortune can do unto one that is reſolved, and fully intends to
do what they ought in every thing. But on the contrary, when the Will and the
Underſtanding are infected and corrupted, every trifle is a torment, and he muſt
look for a cure from the party from whom his malady proceeds. I ſpeak all theſe
things (moſt fair and diſcreet Shepherdeſſes) by experience, for I have found them
in my ſelf, and to my coſt do know, that a prejudicated underſtanding does deceive
the Will, which is blind, and miſled by every thing which it judges good. But oh
God, of all poyſons which does moſt eaſily invenome us, there is none more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
nor worſe to be avoided, then the treachery of men; for, as if they were
our ſworn mortal enemies, they will attempt any thing in the world to venome our
ſouls with their poyſon: If we have high ſpirits, they will fall down upon their
knees, even upon the bare ground, they will honour, reverence, and adore us, they
are our very ſlaves, they will not live but to obey us, and will not change their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
for an Empire: If they meet with a more inferiour or humble ſoul, what ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will they not offer? Into how many ſhapes will they transform themſelves? What
will they not invent to pleaſe her? How many Balls and Treatments will they give?
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53527:171"/>
how will they ſpruce up themſelves in variety of habits? And how careful will they
be to render themſelves pleaſing in the eyes of thoſe whom they have any deſigns
upon? And why all this art, care and paines to pleaſe, but only to win upon thoſe
whom they will afterwards deceive, or rather kill with grief and vexation at their
perfidies and treaſons? I am ſure, the ſtory which you deſire to hear, will make
this moſt apparent unto you, which I am the more willing to relate, becauſe I may
make others more prudent and wary by my example, and by the knowledg of all
ſubtilties and treaſons of men. Be pleaſed to know therefore, Madam, and all you
Fair and Diſcreet Shepherdeſſes, that the ancient City of <hi>Lyons</hi> was the place of my
birth, where my Anceſtors ever held themſelves of the prime Rank: the name of
my Father is <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> and my Mothers <hi>Alcinea;</hi> ſhe left me when I was in
my Nurſes arms; but my Father with abundance of care did educate me in all the
accompliſhments fit for a woman of my quality, as dancing, ſinging, ſeveral Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and ſuch Ornaments; by which he did ſo imbelliſh my youth, that many of
the beſt Rank did Court me in the way of marriage: but my Father, who deſired to
marry me very advantageouſly, and ſaw me yet very young, he waved all motions
that were made, to ſee if any better match would offer it ſelf unto me: I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that ſomtimes I was angry at it; and at that time blamed the Prudence of my
Father, which I now commend; now I ſay, ſince I know how miſerable that woman
is who is a ſubject unto the ſervitude of Tyrants; which are called indeed Husbands
by our Fathers, who are in effect the executioners of mens Tyranny.</p>
                     <p>The firſt that caſt his eyes upon me, or at leaſt, whom I took any notice of, was
one called <hi>Theombres,</hi> who ſince married <hi>Florice.</hi> I was then of an age ſo innocent,
as I did believe my ſelf in no fault if I did believe him. But the clowniſh behaviour
of that man (be it ſpoke without offence unto <hi>Florice</hi>) together with my young
years, which had not made me capable, but inſenſible of ſuch addreſſes, and the
ſhort time he ſtayed there, did defend me from any wicked deſigns he could have
upon me; for whether he had already ſerved this Fair <hi>Florice,</hi> whom he ſince marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or that then he began to love her preſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tly after, I cannot tell; but ſo it was,
that his addreſſe ſerved to no other purpoſe, but to teach me (if I had made uſe of
it) that all men are deceivers; and that the moſt conſtant amongſt them, is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Camelion,</hi> which changes colour, according to the objects it looks upon.</p>
                     <p>Almoſt at the ſame time <hi>Periander,</hi> a young and lovely Cavalier, and owner of
many excellent qualities, free from the vices of cuſtom, which are in all men, he
would make me believe that he was in Love with me. And becauſe his Fathers houſe
was not far diſtant from the place where I dwelt, he had all the convenient oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of ſhewing his good will, that he could deſire. Indeed I was very young,
and knew not at all what it was to Love; yet his conſtant addreſſes, the time he ſpent,
and the flattery of domeſtiques, made me believe he wiſht me well; my capacity was
able to reach no farther: and ſee how much children are obliged unto their Parents;
and how thankful they ought to be unto Heaven, when they have ſuch as are Wiſe
and Prudent. If <hi>Arci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gentorix</hi> had been too haſty in marrying me, as many Fathers
are who deſire nothing more then to be rid of their daughters, he had certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
me upon <hi>Periander;</hi> whom now I ſee rather then I would have married, I
would with my life have pulled my heart out of my breſt.</p>
                     <p>But my Father out of a Prudent deſign which he had, was the cauſe why this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was delayed: many thought it a match very ſutable and advantagious for me,
as well in reſpect of age, as of the nobleneſs and valour of <hi>Periander,</hi> but eſpecial
of his eſtate, which is the main thing moſt Fathers conſider. This buſineſs being
ſpun out to the length, it hapned preſently after that one <hi>Hylas,</hi> a Cavalier, or a
Paſtor of the Iſle of <hi>Carmagues</hi> in the Province of the Roma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, came accidentally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Lyons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is none in the company (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and interrupted) who does not know
him very well. <hi>Dorinde</hi> then ſmiled; ſince you know him ſo very well, replied
ſhe, I ſhall nor need to relate his tricks which he has put upon me. We do know,
ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> of his Love unto you: how he put his picture in a glaſs, and preſented
it unto you: and briefly of all his behaviour with you and with <hi>Periander</hi> until his
departure from <hi>Lyons.</hi> I believe (ſaid <hi>Dorinde</hi>) that he has been forward enough
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53527:171"/>
in blazing his Heroick Acts, but I make a queſtion whether he was true in his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Do not doubt it Coſen (ſaid <hi>Florice</hi>) for I heard all he ſaid, and he has not
the gift of lying, as he has of inconſtancy. Leſt then I ſhould be tedious, (continued
<hi>Dorinde</hi>) I will wave all diſcourſe concerning him, only will obſerve, that <hi>Hylas</hi> is
the ſecond perſon that deceived me; for <hi>Periander</hi> who was the ſecond who loved me,
he had not yet compleated his treaſon. But I muſt needs confeſs, that of all thoſe
who ever deceived me, I complain leaſt of <hi>Hylas,</hi> for he proteſted ſeriouſly unto
me, that he would Love me moſt faithfully as long as his humour continued; but if
that were paſt, neither Heaven nor Earth had bonds ſtrong enough to hold him:
ſo as this free and ingenious confeſſion, keeps me from blaming him; and when I
think upon his change, I do only accuſe the general fault of men, amongſt which I
reckon <hi>Hylas</hi> the leaſt deceiver of all. But ſince you know all the paſſages betwixt
him, <hi>Periander, Florice,</hi> and my ſelf, I will return to the diſcourſe where I left. I
muſt tell you, that <hi>Theombres</hi> carried <hi>Florice</hi> out of the Town, and how <hi>Cryſeide</hi>
that Fair ſtranger eſcaped out of King <hi>Gondebauts</hi> priſon, aſſuring my ſelf Madam,
that he could tell you no farther; ſince then he left the banks of <hi>Arar</hi> to follow the
Fair trans-<hi>Alpine, Cryſeide,</hi> as many ſay.</p>
                     <p>Be pleaſed to know then, that <hi>Periander</hi> ſeeing himſelf alone with me, having loſt
the Rival whom he always much feared, he did ſo devote himſelf wholly unto me,
at leaſt in ſhew, that his Love was unknown only unto ſuch as would not know it. As
ſoon as ever I waked every morning, I was ſure of a ſervant from him to bid me
good morrow, and to bring either ſome flowers, or ſome rare fruits of the ſeaſon:
I no ſooner ſet my foot out of doors towards the Temple, but I found him ready to
tender his ſervices unto me: after dinner, no garden or publique rendevous of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
was about the Town, but he carryed me thither: after ſupper, bals never fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
either at my houſe, or ſome of my friends, by his procurement: that night was
very bluſtering and ſtormy, if I had not muſick at my window, ſomtimes voices,
ſomtimes Inſtruments, ſomtimes one ſort, another time another: all his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques
wore no other Livery but mine; himſelf never wore any favour but what he
begg'd from me. To be brief Madam, all this was not done in a corner, but (as I
may ſay) upon the houſe top: he called and profeſſed himſelf my ſervant publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
I muſt confeſs that he did ſo flatter my young unexperienced youth, as I did
comply with him: and the rather, becauſe my Father conſidering the merit of this
young Cavalier, and the affection which he expreſſed unto me, was minded, contrary
to his deſign, to marry me unto him.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time, there was two Cavaliers who did both caſt their eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me; one was a ſtranger and called <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> the other was a neighbour about
the banks of <hi>Arar,</hi> and his name was <hi>Merindor:</hi> the firſt of theſe came with King
<hi>Gondebaut</hi> from beyond the <hi>Alps,</hi> and was a <hi>Goth;</hi> to ſhew, that be a man born in any
Region whereſoever, yet he cannot be exempt from the fault of his ſex, I mean from
being giddy, unconſtant, and a deceiver. This <hi>Bellimartes</hi> was he who kept <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>
priſoner, the ſervant, and ſince the Husband of the unfortunate, and happy
<hi>Cryſeide,</hi> for ſo I praiſe the unfortunate and fortunate events, which ſhe reſented
during the time of their Loves: and were not the ſtory too long, I would relate it,
for I am confident you would be of the ſame judgment. You need not take ſo much
pains (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) for we know it already, partly from <hi>Hylas,</hi> and partly from the
Fair <hi>Florice.</hi> 'Tis very well, ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> for thereby you will better underſtand
the ſequel of my relation.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Bellimartes</hi> then, after he had renounced all his pretenſions unto <hi>Arimant,</hi>
as <hi>Florice</hi> I believe has told you, he addreſſed himſelf particularly unto the King,
and put him in memory of all his long ſervices which he had done, the dangers he
had paſſed, the wounds he had received, and the blood he had loſt, alſo ſhewed
many great ſcars which he had in ſeveral places: then he beſeeched him to conſider,
that for all theſe he had got nothing, but the bare honour of ſpending in his ſervice
both his dayes and eſtate: that true it was, he held this honour at a high price, and
would not exchange it for any recompence he could give: But though this was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
for <hi>Bellimartes;</hi> yet it was not ſutable with the grandeur and Majeſty of a
great King; that it ſhould be ſaid he had ſo long and ſo faithfully ſerved, and ſerved
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53527:172"/>
a Maſter and received no other gratification, but the empty ſound of being called
his ſervant; this would argue that I did not ſerve a good Maſter. Unto theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
he added many others, which ſo moved the heart of that generous King,
as after he had layed the fault upon himſelf in never asking any recompence, to ſhew
ſome effects of his good will, he beſtowed upon him the Regiment of ſtranger Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
which for the guard of the Town, he entertained in <hi>Lyons:</hi> an office truly ſo
honourable and ſo beneficial, as it was a gratification beyond all his hopes, and by
which he did thrive ſo well, that in a ſhort time he might without preſumption aſpire
unto the beſt matches in all the Country.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things fell out whilſt I was aſſiduouſly courted and ſerved by <hi>Periander.</hi>
And becauſe <hi>Bellimartes</hi> had a mind to ſettle himſelf in that Province where he had
ſuch a beneficial office, he intended to match himſelf ſo, that he might rather get
friends then money for the portion; upon this ground he caſt his eye upon me, and
at ſuch a time that I was ſo much againſt him, as I could never ſince endure the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of him. At the ſame time alſo <hi>Merindor</hi> being newly returned from travel,
he did unluckily ſee me at the marriage of <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> and from that time began
alſo to court me: ſo as <hi>Periander</hi> found himſelf more company then he deſired.
'Tis true <hi>Merindor</hi> did carry the matter much better, and with more diſcretion then
<hi>Bellimartes,</hi> who preſuming upon the Kings favour, and the authority which he
had in the Town, did at the very firſt accoſt me publiquely, as thinking, that though
<hi>Periander</hi> was more in favour with me, yet the advantages of his fortune would
prevail with <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> to make choiſe of him before <hi>Periander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This addreſs did inflame the affection of <hi>Periander</hi> more then ever, and he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
more Love unto me then before; he was ſo netled to think that another ſhould
take from him that prey which he had been ſo long in chaſe after, that he thought
time to beſtow himſelf. So that he reſolved, with my conſent, to make the motion
of marriage unto my Father. I muſt confeſs that I did conſent unto it, becauſe I
did not like <hi>Bellimartes;</hi> his age and his rough behaviour reſembling a man in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
did make me almoſt afraid of him. As for <hi>Merindor,</hi> I was not yet acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with him, for he carried the matter with ſo much cautious diſcretion, as it was
hard to know whether he was in earneſt or in jeſt. <hi>Periander</hi> then, to loſe no time,
did motion the marriage unto <hi>Arcingentorix;</hi> and at the firſt overture, ſubmitted
himſelf wholly unto him, and deſired him to write what conditions he pleaſed; my
Father firſt thanked him for his good will; and told him, that truly he had yet no
thoughts of marrying me, ſince my age required no great haſte: but yet to make it
appear how much he eſteemed of his alliance, he would promiſe him within a month
to let him know his full reſolution. All theſe things could not be tranſacted ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
but <hi>Bellimartes</hi> and <hi>Merindor</hi> were advertiſed, and therefore they both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to croſs this treaty as much poſſibly they could; but believing that <hi>Arcingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torix</hi>
would not marry me againſt my will, they thought the beſt way was to gain
me, and therefore they declared themſelves more openly then before.</p>
                     <p>I remember that <hi>Merindor</hi> in this reſolution meeting me one morning in the
Temple, whither <hi>Periander</hi> conducted me, and went out; he kneeled down cloſe by
me, and ſaid; Did you come hither, Fair <hi>Dorinde,</hi> to pray unto the Gods, or to
thank them? I did not know how to anſwer him, becauſe I knew not what he
meant; and therefore after I had looked upon him without giving any anſwer, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to my prayers again. What means this ſilence (ſaid he again) is it a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of ſcorn? or is it becauſe you would be importuned? Neither, ſaid I unto him,
for I do much eſteem <hi>Merindor,</hi> but it is becauſe I do not underſtand you: for what
do you mean by prayers and thanks? I ask you (ſaid he) whether you came to
pray the Gods that you may marry <hi>Periander,</hi> or give them thanks, becauſe they
have granted that requeſt before? Neither the one nor the other, (anſwered I, and
ſmiled) you are a diſſembler, ſaid he, to ſay ſo: you are incredulous, anſwered I, if
you do not believe me. Why? ſaid he, can you deny a thing which is known unto
all? Why? anſwered I, and turned my head the other way, why doe you ask me
if you know, and if you will not believe me? I do know that which all knows, ſaid
he, but I do ask you that which you only can tell me: tell me therefore upon what
conſideration do you take this Husband? As a daughter ſhould take him (anſwered I)
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53527:172"/>
who is given her by her Father. I wiſh to God (ſaid he and ſighed) that you took
him only out of obedience and not will: my will, anſwered I, ſhall be alwayes the
will of <hi>Arcingentorix:</hi> but pray tell me <hi>Merintor,</hi> what intereſt have you in all
this that ſhould make you ſigh for it? Well may I ſigh, (ſaid he) for that which I ſhall
never ceaſe weeping; upon this I ſaw his eys began to flow with tears: and becauſe he
would not as I think, let me know any more at that time, he went away and ſpoke
not a word, leaving me fully aſſured that he did Love me, and that this marriage
pierced him to the very heart: but all this had no operation upon me, becauſe I was
already wholly dedicated unto <hi>Periander,</hi> and thought that his merits and affection
did oblige me unto it.</p>
                     <p>The little account that I made of <hi>Merindors</hi> diſpleaſure, when he went away,
went ſo neer his heart, that being almoſt out of all hopes of getting my Love, as
long as <hi>Periander</hi> lived, he was in two or three minds to fight him, and ſee, upon
which of the two, the lot would fall. As he was deeply in this thought, a friend
of his did meet him, in whom he had great confidence. <hi>Euphroſias</hi> (for that was the
name of his dear and wiſe friend) ſeeing <hi>Merindor</hi> walk with his hat pulled over his
eyes, looked upon the ground, and his cloke lapped diſorderly about him, walking
in the ſtreets, and never looking upon any; he knew that ſomthing troubled his mind:
and becauſe he knew that youth and courage are often apt unto too violent reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which they may repent of when it is too late, he went unto him, and ſaluted
him: and when he ſaw that he did not anſwer what <hi>Merindor</hi> (ſaid he and took him
by the arm) will you not ſpeak unto your friends? <hi>Merindor</hi> hearing this voice,
and feeling himſelf held by the arm, ſtopped ſhort, and looked upon <hi>Euphroſias</hi> as
if he were newly revived out of an extaſie: and after he had ſtood a while mute;
Good <hi>Euphroſias</hi> (ſaid he) pardon this fault which proceeds from a very bad humour
which has ſeiſed upon me. I will (anſwered his friend) upon condition you will tell
me the cauſe. Though perhaps you would not know it, anſwered <hi>Merindor,</hi> yet I
beſeech you hear it, for I have need of your counſel in a buſineſs which concerns me
as neer as my life: but let us go aſide leſt any ſhould hear us diſcourſe. Upon this
making choiſe of a private place, he began to tell him the original of his Love, the
progreſs, and the preſent condition wherein he was: afterwards he acquainted him
with the Love of <hi>Bellimartes</hi> and <hi>Periander:</hi> but when he came to the diſcourſe he
had with me in the Temple, and my anſwers in favour of <hi>Periander,</hi> he entred into
ſuch a paſſion, that the Prudent <hi>Euphroſias</hi> did ſee, that the affection which he had
unto me, was too great to be diverted either by reaſons or entreaties: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to avoid the two evils which he foreſaw, he thought it moſt neceſſary to draw
him only from the moſt dangerous, which was his hatred unto <hi>Periander,</hi> and as for
the cure of his affection, there was no way but to refer it unto time: therefore in
lieu of any ſharp reprehenſions, or any four looks, he ſmiled upon him, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thus; Good <hi>Merindor</hi> (ſaid he) tell me upon your faith, if this be all the cauſe
of your being thus diſcompoſed? How? (ſaid <hi>Merindor</hi>) is not this enough, ſince
my affection is ſuch unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that it is a thing moſt impoſſible for me to help it?
And do I not ſee before my face, the man that is the great obſtructor of my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
Is there no way, anſwered his friend, to find a remedy? None, anſwered
<hi>Merindor,</hi> that I know, but to take away the life of him, that takes away from me
that happineſs without which I cannot live. Oh <hi>Merindor!</hi> cried out <hi>Euphroſias,</hi>
you take things at the worſt. Tell me, I beſeech you; do you think <hi>Dorinde</hi> Loves
<hi>Periander?</hi> Think it? ſaid <hi>Merindor,</hi> nay I were the moſt incredulous fool that
lives if I were not certain of it. Then (replied his Wiſe friend) you muſt not go
the worſt way to compaſſe what you deſire: for you can never hope to get the good
will of <hi>Dorinde</hi> by murdering that perſon whom ſhe Loves beſt; your paſſion does
but flatter and deceive you, for by that courſe you will make her hate you even to
the very death. Certainly, ſaid <hi>Merindor,</hi> there is no remedy, if this be not good:
Certainly, ſaid <hi>Euphroſias,</hi> this is neither good, nor a remedy; but I beſeech you
tell me, why you think it ſo neceſſary for <hi>Periander</hi> to die? Becauſe (ſaid he) the
Love that <hi>Dorinde</hi> bears unto him, is the cauſe why ſhe does not Love me: If that
be it, replied <hi>Euphroſias,</hi> make the ſame reaſon as well obſtruct him, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs
you; I mean, that ſhe ſhall not Love <hi>Periander</hi> becauſe ſhe Loves <hi>Merindor.</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:53527:173"/>
Yes, yes, ſaid <hi>Merindor,</hi> you are very kind; but here is the difficulty, how ſhould
I make her love me? Do as <hi>Periander</hi> does, anſwered <hi>Euphroſias,</hi> nay, and better;
why ſhould you think heaven will not be as favourable to you, as any other Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
of your age? But <hi>Euphroſias</hi> (ſaid he) ſhe does love <hi>Periander.</hi> So much the
better, anſwered <hi>Euphroſias,</hi> it is a ſigne ſhe is not inſenſible, nor invulnerable by the
blows of Love: Pray why ſhould you think your ſervices ſhould not work as happy
effects as his? You ſee <hi>Merindor</hi> that you do love <hi>Dorinde</hi> in ſuch a height, that you
cannot retire; reſolve with your ſelf to love her ſtill in ſuch extremity, that it ſhall
invite her unto Love again, or rather to conſtrain her unto it. Oh my dear friend,
ſaid <hi>Merindor,</hi> and ſighed; how difficult is it to bring this enterprize to paſs! Yet
let me tell you, notwithſtanding all I told you before concerning <hi>Periander,</hi> that I do
verily believe ſhe does not love him; but all ſhe does, is only in obedience unto her
Father. So much the better ſtill (ſaid <hi>Euphroſias</hi>) for if ſhe does not love him, you
will far ſooner win her, then if ſhe were engaged unto any. Oh but if ſhe do love
<hi>Periander,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Merindor</hi>) what hopes can I have? Why ſhould not you hope as
well as another, replied <hi>Euphroſias?</hi> Will not moſt merit ſooneſt obtain? Or ſay
that Argument have no validity in it, you muſt know <hi>Merindor,</hi> that the love of
women is one of thoſe things that muſt not be ſought after by the Rules of Reaſon,
and of whom one muſt never deſpair; for be moſt aſſured, that there is a certain
hour in the day in the which they can deny nothing; And therefore the anſwer of
the Oracle was good, when a Lover asked what he ſhould do to overcome the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of his Miſtris; The Anſwer was,
<q>Love, be Bold, and Continue.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>With ſuch diſcourſe as this <hi>Euphroſias</hi> diverted his friend from his deſigne againſt
<hi>Periander,</hi> and filled him ſo full of new hopes, that he began to court <hi>Dorinde</hi> with
ſuch freſh aſſaults, as <hi>Periander</hi> and <hi>Bellimartes</hi> could not chuſe but be jealous; for
until then he did not openly declare himſelf, but thought himſelf out of hopes, yet
now by reaſon of the time of my Father's anſwer unto <hi>Periander,</hi> he was the only
mote in his eye; and certainly not without reaſon, for I ſeeing my father very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to give me unto him, I thought my ſelf already ſo certain to be his wife, that
I devoted my ſelf wholly unto him.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe three were thus ſtriving who ſhould win me, the term which my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſet for <hi>Periander</hi>'s anſwer drew on; and he who expected with extream impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the day whereon he ſhould be pronounced happy, that very evening he failed
not to go unto my Father with three of his neereſt kinred; As ſoon as he came into
his preſence, he fell down upon his knees, and beſeeched him with as much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as if his life was at ſtake, that he would be pleaſed to give him that anſwer which
he promiſed. But Sir, ſaid he, if it be not ſutable to my deſires, make but a ſigne,
and it ſhall ſuffice to be rid of me; for I am moſt perfectly reſolved to throw my ſelf,
and all my deſires and deſigns, into the bottom of <hi>Arar.</hi> He accompanied theſe
words with ſuch actions of his hands, head, and every part of his body, that every
one believed they came from his heart: And my Father, as the reſt, being deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by this opinion, did hold out his hand to take him up from his knees; Son, ſaid
he unto him, for ſo I will hereafter call you, riſe up, and believe, that if I have any
thing which is dearer then <hi>Dorinde,</hi> I will give it unto you and your merit; I do
here give her unto you, and pray unto the heavens to make you a moſt happy pair.
<hi>Periander</hi> raviſhed with joy, did kiſs the hand of <hi>Arcingentorix</hi> an hundred times,
with ſo many demonſtrations of Love, as none doubted but that his Love was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time my Father called for me, and taking my hand, carried me in to
<hi>Periander.</hi> Daughter (ſaid he) I would have you love this Cavalier, as him that
muſt be your husband, and unto whom I now do give you, and within theſe eight
days, I will prepare for your marriage. Upon this <hi>Periander</hi> advanced, and came
to ſalute me; and I Sir, ſaid he, do take you for my Lord and Father, and her for
my Wife and Miſtris.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:53527:173"/>
Judge, I beſeech you Madam, and you wiſe and fair Shepherdeſſes, whether ſuch
promiſes as theſe ſo ſolemnly made, would not make any one believe them indiſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable?
But with ſhame to all humane kind, you ſhall hear the perfidie of all men in
general included in this one particular man. Theſe eight days which <hi>Arcingentorix</hi>
prefixed for a concluſion of the marriage, were variouſly imployed: For my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
whole care was in providing all things neceſſary for this marriage: All the
Neighborhood to ſhew how much they loved and honoured our Family, deſigned
ſeveral diverſions of Tilting, Masks, Dancings, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellimartes</hi> on the contrary was perpetually whiſpering into the Kings ear, and
contriving how to break off this marriage. But <hi>Merindor,</hi> what in ſighs and tears,
what in careſſing me and my Father, his time was ſo ſpent, that he could hardly
ſleep: He was continually telling ſeveral tales, and foretelling me of <hi>Periander</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy,
diſſimulation, and perfidie, which ſince I have found but too true, and
unto which I would not then hearken, thinking it an offence againſt the love which
he bore unto me, and which I had unto that Deceiver. As for <hi>Periander,</hi> his whole
care was in careſſing me, and treating me with all the diverſions about the Town,
and thought upon nothing elſe, at leaſt in ſhew. For my part, I muſt confeſs I
thought my ſelf ſo obliged to him, that my ſtudy was wholly how to pleaſe him.
Now, ſage <hi>Druide,</hi> ſee how heaven does laugh at all our Deſigns, and can change
them.</p>
                     <p>During this while, whether it was with too much dancing, or by eating too much
fruit, or rather, as I think, by coming into ſome infectious place; or to ſay better,
whether it was the will of heaven by this ſmall ſickneſs to prevent a greater miſery,
I cannot tell; but upon the ſixth day, I was taken with an extream pain in my head,
and a Fever ſo violent, as put me all into a flame, and continued ſeveral days, and
ſtill with ſuch a drowſineſs upon me, as I could hardly lift up my eyes: and after it
had thus tormented me, one morning when the Phiſicians came to ſee me, they found
me full of red ſpots, which by little and little growing bigger, did ſo become bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
that I was a horrid ſight to be ſeen: It was a diſeaſe which children are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſubject unto; and many other children and young people of my age in the
ſame Town were at the ſame time infected as I was.</p>
                     <p>This malady thus falling out, it prevented all deſigns and preparations; for I was
ſo exceedingly tormented, that many thought I would die: <hi>Periander</hi> at the firſt
came twice or thrice to ſee me, and ſeemed to be extreamly diſpleaſed that our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
ſhould be thus retarded: But as ſoon as the Smal pox appeared, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
after ſo much as ſet his foot into the houſe where I was; he ſent indeed ſomtimes
to ſee how I did, but he was ſo afraid of me, and catching the diſeaſe, that he would
not ſo much as come neer the door.</p>
                     <p>As long as pain was upon me, I muſt confeſs, I did not reſent his behaviour, though
every one elſe did think it very ſtrange; but I was ſo full of pain, as I never asked
what became of him; yet afterwards, when the violence was a little paſt, I did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what became of <hi>Periander;</hi> and perceiving the little memory he had of me, I
began to think that <hi>Merindor</hi> ſpoke truth when he foretold me of <hi>Periander</hi>'s incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy;
and yet I could not chuſe but ſeek out for ſome reaſons to excuſe him: ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I did imagine, that perhaps ſome buſineſs had carryed him out of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and
that it grieved him as much as it did me that he could not hear how I did; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles
I had an opinion, that my Father had changed his mind, and had forbidden
him to ſee me: ſomtimes I thought he was ſick, and that none in my houſe would
acquaint me: Briefly, I turned every ſtone, and tryed all my wits, and all how to
deceive my ſelf: But my malady continuing long, and this perfidious man alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in his neglect, I was but too well aſſured that his mind was turned.</p>
                     <p>What do you think Madam, and you fair Shepherdeſs, the reſentment of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
might move me unto? At the firſt, I wept and was ſilent, and hid my tears
from the ſight of every one; But when I heard it the common talk, and that every
one condemned his falſeneſs, it was impoſſible for me to hide my reſentments any
longer.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>Merindor,</hi> as if my ſickneſs had augmented his affection, he
was continually at my chamber door, asking how I did, and would gladly have ſeen
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53527:174"/>
me, if they would have permitted him. And as ſoon as ever he heard all danger
was paſt, he brought muſique of ſeveral ſorts unto my door, to divert me: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he knew of <hi>Perianders</hi> change, I remember, he cauſed a ſong to be ſung at
my chamber door, which intimated the inconſtancy of a Lover. And becauſe he
thought that perhaps I did not underſtand the words at that diſtance, he ſent the
ſong in a paper unto me, by a woman that came into my chamber: yet I was ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
that I heard and remembred every word. I ſeemed not to take any notice
of all this, though I had a great reſentment of it: but when I was alone, the thoughts
of <hi>Perianders</hi> neglect and oblivion, made me even hate his humour: and more,
when being out of my bed, and yet durſt not go out of my chamber, becauſe my
face was much changed, as is common in that diſeaſe; he did not ſo much as ſend to
ſee how I did: now I thought it time to forget him, as well as he did me; and I
thank Heaven for it, I did ſo exclude him from my thoughts, that I made him a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtranger unto them: It would be but loſs of time to tell you what reproaches I
laid in his diſh; how I reſolved my ſelf againſt him; how ſadly I firſt reſented this
ſeparation; for the truth is, I had ſuch confidence in his promiſed affection, that I
thought it impoſſible to alter: but now, finding my ſelf deceived, and my diſeaſe to
be the cauſe of his apoſtacy, I could not complain againſt him enough, and indeed
againſt my ſelf for believing him: now did I admire his inconſtancy, and for his ſake
condemn the fickleneſs and perfidy of all men whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding I had ſworn a hundred times never to care for him again, and
that though he ſhould return, yet never to look upon him; yet for all this, I could
not chuſe but ask him by one that I imployed, what was the cauſe of this ſo ſudden
ſeparation? And ſhe who asked him the queſtion, was a woman that waited upon
me, and in whom I had great confidence during all the time of his addreſſes unto
me. <hi>Periander</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him) how comes it to paſſe that you never ſee <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde,</hi>
nor ask what becomes of her? How? <hi>Dorinde?</hi> (anſwered he) is ſhe alive
ſtill? Alive (ſaid the woman) why? ſhe is recovered, and ready to come out of her
chamber. Ah Sweet-heart, replied <hi>Periander,</hi> you are much miſtaken, or elſe does
mock me; certainly ſhe is dead: but has left in her room<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, a certain ugly woman,
whom for the Love of her they call <hi>Dorinde:</hi> but the Fair <hi>Dorinde</hi> whom I Loved is
certainly dead, and I am ſo ſorry for it, as I will not go and ſee this <hi>Dorinde,</hi> leſt the
memory of the other ſhould give an occaſion of tears. Fie, fie, <hi>Periander,</hi> (replied
the woman much amazed at his anſwer) is it not enough to ſeperate your ſelf from
her, but you muſt mock at her miſery? <hi>Dorinde,</hi> as I told you before, replied he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
is not in the world: What? would you have me go and Love her in her
grave? And as for her that is in her room; alas Sweet-heart, ſhe is ſo ugly, that I
will leave her to whom that will. As ſoon as he had ſaid ſo, he went away and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not for any anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Judge Madam, whether this was to be endured; and yet I muſt ſwallow this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pill, and ſeem, as if I did not taſt it. But was it not the height of cruelty, to
ſtrike one that was ſo deeply wounded before? For firſt my ſickneſs had ſpoiled my
face, which was wound enough, without the addition of another from a perſon
whom I leaſt expected it.</p>
                     <p>A little while after, my Father came to ſee me; and not without tears in his eyes
to find me ſo much changed: which I perceiving, Father, ſaid I unto him, never
afflict your ſelf for the loſs of that which could not be long kept: but rather, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you to rejoyce with me, ſince by the loſs of a trifle I am reſcued from an ill
fortune. Upon this I told him all that <hi>Periander</hi> had done and ſaid, then falling
down upon my knees, I beſeeched him, that he would not command me to have any
more converſe with this perfidious man: <hi>Dorinde</hi> (ſaid he and took me up) I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you I will not; and I command you, not ſo much as to name him unto me, who
thinks him the moſt unworthy Cavalier that lives.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, my Father went away, and left me extreamly well ſatisfied with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
And from hence forward I began to think more of <hi>Merindor,</hi> then formerly
I had, as thinking that his behaviour towards me did oblige me to prefer him before
any other; for though <hi>Bellimartes</hi> did ſend often to viſit me, and was very careful
in ſending all ſuch remedies as were proper for that diſeaſe; yet his humour and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53527:174"/>
was contrary unto mine, ſo as I could not for my heart Love him.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, I recovered very faſt; not but that my face was ſo blaſted, as I
was hardly knowable; and when I looked in a glaſs, I admired to ſee my ſelf: and
therefore I ſtill kept the door of my chamber ſhut very cloſe, to the end none
ſhould enter but ſuch as waited upon me; hoping ſtill that time might hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y make
ſome amendment. But <hi>Merindor,</hi> whoſe affection to me ſeemed to be greater
then before, and who never ſtirred out of my anti-chamber with ſeveral ſorts of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
as I told you before: one day when I was alone with that woman whom I ſent
unto <hi>Periander,</hi> and when the door was but ill ſhut, he entred in upon ſuch a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
that he was upon his knees before me ere I could ſee him. As fortune was, I
had a mask upon my face: but I could no way hide my eyes but with my hands, and
they were ſo blaſted, that I was aſhamed to ſhew them, for I had not time to put on
my gloves. You may imagine me not a little ſurpriſed when I ſaw him; I did my
ende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>vour to get into my Cloſet, but he kneeled ſo before me, and held my knees,
that I was not able to riſe from my ſeat: Oh <hi>Merindor</hi> (ſaid I unto him) you are
exceeding troubleſome unto me, and would do me a great pleaſure, if you would
think upon me no more then <hi>Periander</hi> doth. Alas, alas, anſwered he, do you think
to limit the effects of my affection unto the ſhallow amity of him whom you named?
Ah Madam, pardon me I beſeech you, if I think his offence not ſo great unto me, as
it is unto you Unto me? anſwered I; I aſſure you <hi>Merindor,</hi> if <hi>Perianders</hi> offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
trouble you no more then me, you will never complain againſt him: for as for
my part, I am ſo far from any memory of his name, that whatſoever he does cannot
offend me But let us talk of ſomthing elſe I beſeech you, and tell me, what makes
you ſo deſirous to ſee me in this condition wherein I am; for me thinks you ſhould
rather ſhun all occaſions of it, then deſire it: upon this queſtion I cauſed him to riſe,
and a chair to be ſet for him, becauſe I would not ſuffer him to kneel. Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he, the affection of him who loves, will never let him reſt till he have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his curioſity, by ſeeing her whom he loves and adores; and ſuch is mine to you:
do not imagine, I beſeech you that I do love you with any reſerved thoughts to leave
off, though you ſhould not be ſo Fair as you was before; ſuch a love deſerves not
the name: and I do eſteem rather a treaſon, and not to be entertained into any
heart that loves well: my affection ſets no other term but eternity, nor no other
condition, but to Love <hi>Dorinde,</hi> as ſhe is, and as ſhe ſhall be; for the future, as well
as for the preſent. Now ſee, Wiſe and Fair <hi>Druide,</hi> how apt one is to judg others
by themſelves; a very dog that is burned will fear the fire: yet I, leſſe wiſe then
thoſe animals, after I had been deluded by the ſupple language of <hi>Periander,</hi> could
not chuſe but give credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto the gilded flatteries of <hi>Merindor;</hi> thinking, that a
man well born, and a Cavalier, ought above other men to be juſt, and to have his
heart in his tongue: but I confeſs, that I did partly believe that which I ſhould not
have believed at all; I began to fancy that I might live happily with him: but to
tell you truly, I did it much out of ſpite againſt <hi>Periander,</hi> thinking it a full revenge,
if I gave my ſelf unto another, but never thinking that it was a revenge againſt my
ſelf: but it was imprudence, which commonly is a conſequent of little experience,
did give me this ſimple counſel, which ſince hath coſt me many a tear, and much
torment.</p>
                     <p>The anſwer that I gave him was this; Do you think <hi>Merindor</hi> that any one who
has a deſign to make themſelves loved, will ſay leſs then you? I think (ſaid he) that
thoſe who have the ſame deſires which I have, may make uſe of the ſame words.
But (ſaid I) if all thoſe who have the ſame deſires, do ſpeak as you do, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thoſe who truſt them, what aſſurance can I have in your words? <hi>Periander</hi>
uſed them a thouſand times, and even deafned me with his candid language, which
was only a gloſſe upon intended treachery. If my words (replied <hi>Merindor</hi>) were
not accompanied with ſome more aſſured teſtimonies, I muſt needs confeſſe the
treachery of <hi>Periander,</hi> might make you ſuſpect all I ſay. But, Oh <hi>Dorinde,</hi> I hope
I am not ſo unfortunate, but that you have taken notice of my actions, and how,
ſince the very firſt day I ever ſaw you, I have devoted my ſelf to be wholly yours.
'Tis true, anſwered I, and I ſhould be very ungrateful if I did not acknowledg that
your proceeding and behaviour does much oblige me; but with all let me tell you,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53527:175"/>
That I think all men make it their glory to deceive thoſe who put any truſt in them.
If ſo, replied <hi>Merindor,</hi> then I proteſt Madam, that henceforward I will not be a
man, the very name ſhall be odious unto me, and I will abominate the title, as much
as I do that of Vilain or Traytor. Do you ſpeak this in good earneſt, ſaid I unto
him? Madam (anſwered he) Do you ask this queſtion in good earneſt? Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you ſhould ſtill doubt of <hi>Merindors</hi> affection? No, no <hi>Dorinde,</hi> Do not give
your eyes, your ears, your judgement the lie; I am ſure they all tell you that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindor</hi>
loves you: had he been prone to change, he might with more reaſon then
<hi>Periander,</hi> who received favours a thouſand for one. <hi>Merindor</hi> (ſaid I) I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
it, and having obſerved your affection to me ever ſince you firſt ſaw me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
during all the time of my ſickneſs, I have often ſaid unto my ſelf, what would
he have done if he had found as much good will from me, as I have ſhewed unto that
Deceiver <hi>Periander?</hi> But this is not enough to aſſure me that you will not change;
for all men, by the example of one hath taught me, that it is Beauty which they
love, and not the perſon of her who has it; ſo as when by any accident this Beauty
is gone, their love is immediately gone with it. Oh <hi>Dorinde</hi> (ſaid he) you are an
unjuſt Judge, to pronounce ſentence againſt all men in general, for the offence of
one particular man: Do you not ſee that into what condition ſoever your ſickneſs
hath brought you, yet ſtill I love, nay even adore you? Perhaps (ſaid I) you may
love me yet, becauſe you have not ſeen my face, and does not think it ſo deformed
as it is by my ſickneſs. But to cure you of your diſeaſe, I will let you ſee it, upon
condition you will lament my loſs, and afterwards leave me at reſt to endure my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady
alone: Upon this I pulled off my mask, and ſhewed him my face, which had
no reſemblance of what it was before, more then the name of a Face: This I did
with deſign, that he ſeeing me, might not love me any longer, and ſo I ſhould be
neither troubled nor deceived: then if he did continue loving me, I might be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that my uglineſs would never make him change, it being impoſſible I ſhould be
worſe then I was. I obſerved that as ſoon as he ſaw me, he ſtood mute, and was
much aſtoniſhed, and that tears preſently after trickled from his eyes, ſo as he was
not able to ſpeak; but a little after he began thus: I muſt confeſs, Madam, that your
diſeaſe uſed you more unkindly then any, unleſs they ſaw you, can imagine; but
this alteration cannot change my affection to you, if you think it does, Madam, you
do wrong me: <hi>Periander</hi>'s action is unpardonable; but be aſſured, I beſeech you,
that only death, and not any accident of Fortune whatſoever, is able to quench
thoſe flames which your Vertues and your Merits have kindled in the heart of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindor.</hi>
I do not deny but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hat it was your-Beauty which firſt invited me unto you,
which gave me a will to ſerve you; but ſince I have had the honour and happineſs to
be better acquainted with you, oh <hi>Dorinde,</hi> I find more laſting invitations and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unto Love, then any Beauty can be: Your Soul, you Soul <hi>Dorinde,</hi> your
noble and ſweet ſoul is far fairer then ever was your face; and therefore, as your
face firſt invited me, your ſoul will eternally keep me to your ſervice.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould be too long, Madam, ſhould I relate all the diſcourſe which we had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Subject; and it is fit I bury them in ſilence, as he did preſently after in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion;
But ſo it was, I thought that I had found a man that was not a Deceiver, and
in that belief I contracted amity with him. The way of your behaviour to me (ſaid
I unto him) ever ſince you firſt ſaw me, and the aſſurance you give me that my face
does not affright you, nor leſſen your affection to me, does oblige me to eſteem
and love you more then I thought I could any, after ſuch an unworthy falſhood as
that of <hi>Periander;</hi> and if you do continue, as hitherto you have, aſſure your ſelf
<hi>Merindor,</hi> that I will love and eſteem you as your merits do oblige me. Oh <hi>Dorinde,</hi>
replied he, I am not contented with this promiſe, ſince your love is to be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
according to my merits, and therefore I am afraid your love will be but a little.
No, no, ſaid I, it may be infinite, and yet but hold proportion with your merits; but
to content you, I do promiſe, that if you do not Perianderize, I will love you as much
as you can deſire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Merindor</hi> having this aſſurance, he fell upon his knees, took my hand by force,
and though it was covered with marks of my diſeaſe, yet he kiſſed it ſeveral times
with ſuch abundance of thanks, as this action gave me more full aſſurance of his love,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53527:175"/>
then my words could him of my good will, and I believe, that if my Father had
not come, he would never have ceaſed his Demonſtrations of Affection and
Thanks.</p>
                     <p>My Father at his entrance ſmiled, becauſe he either ſaw him kneeling before me,
or elſe ſome of the Domeſtiques told him. This invited me to tell him all the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
betwixt us, and to ſpeak very advantagiouſly in behalf of <hi>Merindor:</hi> My diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
and my free expreſſions were ſo agreeable unto my Father, that taking me
aſide, he asked me whether I did really love that Cavalier, and whether I thought
he loved me; and I anſwering, that conſidering both <hi>Perianders</hi> behaviour and his,
I did both love him, and that he loved me. Since it is ſo (ſaid he unto me) I like
him better then I do <hi>Periander:</hi> Sir, ſaid I unto him, you may diſpoſe of me as you
pleaſe, for I have no will but yours. We muſt not be too haſty in any thing (anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he) nor muſt we ſlight them, ſince he has behaved himſelf ſo well, let us enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him with a few handſome delays, and reſolve upon the matter at more leiſure:
then turning towards <hi>Merindor,</hi> he looked upon him with a kind aſpect, thanked him
for the care he had of me in my ſickneſs, and commanded me to bid him welcome, and
honour him as I was obliged.</p>
                     <p>Since this day, the door was never ſhut againſt <hi>Merindor;</hi> as ſoon as I was dreſt,
he might enter into my chamber at all times without denial: and he, who let no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
ſlip, was in it from morning till night, with ſo much ſhew of affection, that
it ſeemed my deformity did augment it. On the other ſide, <hi>Bellimartes</hi> ſeeing how
this Cavalier had admittance, and thinking the ſame might as well be allowed unto
him, did ſend to know whether he might come in or no: And my Father, ſince <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindor</hi>
was permitted, durſt not deny him; ſo as one afternoon he came to ſee me;
but being advertiſed of his coming, I put on my Mask and my Gloves, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,
not to pull them off as long as he ſtayed in my chamber.</p>
                     <p>The diſcourſe of <hi>Bellimartes</hi> ſmelt more of a Stateſ-man then a Lover; and
though he ſaw the ſickneſs had much changed me, yet he ſeemed not to care; but
within a few days after, he made ſuch addreſſes unto King <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> that he ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my Father to marry me. <hi>Bellimartes</hi> being of another Nation, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
amongſt us, my Father deſired no alliance with him, but rather with <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
whom he thought to be a man of much merit, and whoſe eſtate and parents
were not unknown; therefore he beſeeched the King to pardon him, if he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto the marriage, becauſe I only was the ſupport and comfort of his age, and
to marry me unto a ſtranger, who had no ſetled eſtate in his Dominions, was not
any comfort unto him. He told him, that if I did diſ-obey him, he would deſire
to puniſh me no more, then to marry me unto that man; for I ſhould be as good as
baniſhed from him: Moreover, he ſaid, that I was at ſufficient age to make my own
choice, and he would never contradict my Will, ſince it was a buſineſs that made
me either happy or miſerable all my life; and therefore he would not by any means
force my Will: and for a concluſion, he beſeeched the King to remember the
faithful ſervices which he and his Anceſtors had ever done him; and for a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of all, that he would do him the favour not to conſtrain me unto this. The
King, who loved <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and intended to oblige him further by doing this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for him, did anſwer unto all thoſe objections which my Father urged, and to
every point did give good reaſons to cover that Soveraign power which he intended
to uſe in this buſineſs: And as to that objection, that <hi>Bellimartes</hi> had no eſtate in
his Dominions, and that he was a ſtranger, therefore he ſhould never ſee me again;
he anſwered, That he would confer ſuch an eſtate upon him in his Kingdom, as
ſhould take away that exception; and that <hi>Bellimartes</hi> did intimate as much in his
addreſſes unto me, whoſe Beauty now was not ſuch as could invite him to marry me
for any matter of Love, but reaſon of State, and to get Alliance in a Country where
he was a ſtranger: That this reſolution would make him more tractable unto me,
more obedient towards him, and more ſerviceable towards all our kinred, then any
other he could mention unto him. That as to the choice and free liberty of my
Will, which he would leave unto me in this buſineſs, that it was great indiſcretion to
do ſo; becauſe youth and wiſdom can never be together; and that being ſo young
as I was, he would commit a great fault, in leaving it to my own choice; which I
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53527:176"/>
could never make but with indiſcretion: but on the contrary, that he was obliged
by the very name of a Father to find out a Husband for me, ſuch a one as might be
advantagious, and not to leave it unto me to chuſe at random and without judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
That if they ordained Guardians to ſuch as are within age; ſo certainly, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
which is to laſt for life, muſt be contracted by the approbation and conſent of
Wiſe and Prudent perſons, who have the Tuition of any young and unadviſed child.
That it was generally obſerved, few marriages which were made for Love, prove
proſperous in the end; and almoſt all thoſe that were made by adviſe, the contrary:
and that the authority of Wiſe Parents is commonly ſeconded by all ſorts of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and felicities. And as to the ſervices which he and his Anceſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs had done
him, he did make it appear that he had them in memory, by taking ſo much pains
in marrying me unto one whom he eſteemed and loved: that had he not remembred
them, he would have marryed him unto ſome other within his Dominions who was
as rich, and as well allyed as I was: but in this action, he thought to acquit himſelf
of thoſe ſervices which he had received from him and his houſe. To be brief, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
the marriage might be, and if it was not, he had an occaſion to take it unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
upon this he left my Father ſo aſtoniſhed, that he neither could nor durſt anſwer
him a word.</p>
                     <p>The authority of a Soveraign Prince, has ſuch a ſtroke with it in the mind of loyal
ſubjects, that it ſtrikes dead what reſolutions ſoever was to the contrary; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when it comes with a colour of reaſon: for moſt certain it is, that ſubjects
ought naturally to obey their Prince; diſ-obedience is againſt honour, and againſt
great <hi>Tautates:</hi> in all other things, good excuſes may be uſed, and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by perſons of judgment. But in this, my Father had no will to beſtow me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ſtranger, and had rather have dyed then to ſee me in his hands: one while,
he had a mind to tell him that he had already given me unto <hi>Merindor,</hi> but he was
preſently off that, becauſe when the King ſpoke unto him, he did not tell him ſo then;
other whiles, he reſolved to marry us ſecretly, aſſuring himſelf, that when it was
done, <hi>Gondebaut</hi> could not break it: but upon a ſudden he foreſaw ſo many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that would befal both him and us, that he altered his opinion; for he knew
the Kings anger would never cool till he was revenged upon us: ſometimes his
thoughts prompted him to admit me amongſt the Veſtals; but when he fancied that,
he ſaw me ſo reclus'd and buried before I was dead, he waved that reſolution: beſides,
the Kings anger would have been as high againſt him for that, as if he had flatly
diſ-obeyed him. Thus not knowing what courſe to take, he continued many dayes
ſo unreſolved and uncertain, as it troubled him ſo much, that he moved pity from all
that ſaw him.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Bellimartes</hi> whom the King acquainted with all the difficulties
which my Father objected, he took counſel from a prudent and wiſe friend, to gain
me with a golden ſhower, as the Poets ſay <hi>Danae</hi> was by <hi>Jupiter;</hi> I mean, that
though his nature was not over liberal, yet upon this occaſion he ſhould overcome
himſelf, and ſend rich preſents unto me and my Father: for it was the cuſtom of old
people to be covetous, and it was the nature of young women to be deſirous of new
dreſſes, and ſhew themſelves brave amongſt their aſſociates. Probably the King
was of this opinion; for we were ſure that <hi>Bellimartes</hi> was not able of himſelf to
beſtow ſuch delicate curioſities as he ſent unto me, nor ſuch great and rich preſents
as he ſent unto my Father every day. Oh how true a ſaying it is, that ſtones will
ſtrike the Thunderbolt out of the hand of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and that gifts does ſteal away the
liberty of them that receive them. After <hi>Bellimartes</hi> had continued this courſe
ſome twelve or fifteen dayes, his preſents had more eloquence in them, and more
authority then the King. There was not a woman about me, nor a ſervant about
my Father, but was ſo gained, that they talked of nothing but of his merit and of
his valour: all others were not worthy to look upon him; and although he was
formerly very il-favoured, thoſe themſelves that were of that judgment, do now
cry him up to the clouds; but that which was the greateſt wonder unto me, was to
ſee my Father my degrees to approve of that which he ſo much diſproved before:
Daughter (ſaid he unto me) this man is not ſuch a Barbarian as we did conceive
him; thoſe that ſpend their judgment upon one they know not, are much to blame:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53527:176"/>
for who would not have been deceived, in this man? Whoſe birth was amongſt Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians;
whoſe education was in blood and cruelties, and yet his converſation and
humour is quite otherwiſe then at firſt we thought him. For my part, I think, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſerious conſideration, that it were not amiſs, to give the King contentment in
this alliance with him: it muſt needs be very advantagious unto us, and he may one
day advance us above all our Predeceſſors: again, it is not good to reſiſt the will of
him whom Heaven has commanded us to obey; the ruine of him who commits the
crime is impardonable and infallible: for my part, I did reſiſt him when I thought
the man to be not ſo good as he is; but now I know him, I find the King has good
reaſon to admit him into his favour, I ſee my error and my ſimplicity in not
obeying him, and in not acknowledging that happineſſe which he intends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us.</p>
                     <p>Oh Heavens! How little reſolution there is in a childs judgment? And how eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are they ſwayed by the reaſons of thoſe who know how to argue them with art,
they will ſwallow them like bitter pils which are lapt in hony; I did Love <hi>Merindor,</hi>
and I had no inclination at all unto <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and yet my Fathers diſcourſe turned
me which way he pleaſed. Truth is, when I was alone, and remembred <hi>Merindors</hi>
affection, and with what conſtancy he continued his addreſſes during all the noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs
of my ſickneſs; I could not chuſe but pity and be exceedingly ſorry for him.
As ſoon as this courſe was reſolved upon, my Father commanded me not to ſee him
ſo often as I was accuſtomed: I muſt confeſs I lamented the loſs of this Cavalier in
whom I found ſo much affection. But <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> who by his preſents had blinded
the eyes of my Father, was the cauſe of my reſolution to obey him who had the
power over me. Yet being moved unto compaſſion, I intended to advertiſe <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
to the end he might betimes decline any further courtſhip or addreſſes to me, and
divert himſelf ſome other way.</p>
                     <p>The next morning therefore when he came to ſee me, according to his cuſtom, as
ſoon as I heard that he was at my chamber-door, I beſeeched my Father, he would
be pleaſed to give way that he might enter, that I might acquaint him with our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,
to the end he might be no longer deceived; that his conſtant courtſhip,
his humble addreſſes, the hopes which was given him, and his merits and quality de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
all manner of contentment. My Father did much commend my deſign, and
to give us the better opportunity of talk; after <hi>Merindor</hi> was entered, my Father
retired to his own chamber, and left me to ſay what I would. <hi>Merindor</hi> at firſt ſeeing
this new favour, entred into great hopes, thinking that my Father retired purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in favour of him: but when he was gone, he obſerved ſuch a hollow kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
in me, as quite daſhed his hopes again; eſpecially when cauſing him to ſit
down, I ſpoke thus unto him</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Merindor,</hi> your merits, and your good will unto me, does oblige me to honour
and eſteem you as much as any Cavalier in the Country, and would moſt willingly
by any good ſervice, render ſome teſtimony of my reſentments; which invites me
to put you out of ſome doubts, which perhaps you have entred into ſince you ſee
me ſo reſerved towards you. Know therefore <hi>Merindor,</hi> that as long as my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
approved of our marriage, I behaved my ſelf towards you with all the freedom,
that a harmleſſe liberty would permit: but now ſince that hope is quite taken away,
I thought it would be a great ſin, and ſuch a one as deſerved the Title <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

I ſhould deceive you any longer by ſuch petty careſſes, that are apt to delude young

any other whomſoever; and have the ſame thoughts of <hi>Arcingentorix:</hi> for were it
referred unto him, aſſure your ſelf <hi>Merindor,</hi> that he would never look upon any
but you. I have ever found him ſo diſpoſed to Love and honour you, and has held
you in ſuch a high eſteem, as doubtleſſe he would have been extreamly well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if it had been ſo deſigned by the deſtinies, that I might have paſſed away my
dayes with one of ſo much merit as you are. But Heaven has decreed it otherwiſe,
and I am not deſtined to ſo much happineſs; for you muſt know (continued I with
tears in my eyes) that <hi>Gondebaut</hi> does force me to marry <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> Oh Heavens
<hi>Dorinde,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Merindor</hi> and clapped his hands together) will <hi>Gondebaut</hi> marry
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53527:177"/>
you to <hi>Bellimartes?</hi> Yes, (ſaid I unto him ſadly) and I aſſure you <hi>Arcingentorix</hi>
and I have done all we can to prevent it, but find that there is no way to do it but by
death. Since there is that remedy (ſaid he preſently) all hopes are not gone, and
without ſaying any more, or hearing me, he went ſo ſuddenly out of my chamber, as
made it plain he intended ſome violent courſe. I called him ſeveral times, and then
run after him as far as the gates, fearing left in that fury he ſhould do himſelf ſome
harm; but all was in vain, for he was gone out of ſight upon a ſudden, as if he had
wings. My Father who was not far off, hearing me ſpeak ſo loud, he came to me,
and hearing how this young Cavalier was gone, he feared leſt he ſhould make ſome
attempt upon <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and afterwards the King caſt all the blame upon us: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this conſideration, he went unto the houſe of <hi>Bellimartes;</hi> he let him underſtand
in as diſcreet a manner as he could, all the paſſage betwixt <hi>Merindor</hi> and me, that if
any ill hapned we might be diſcharged of it. <hi>Bellimartes</hi> who was a man of courage,
and had all the authority and power in his own hands, did anſwer, that the buſineſſe
did not trouble him at all, and that if <hi>Merindor</hi> was extravagant, he knew how to
tame him.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Merindor</hi> tranſported with extream paſſion, did go unto his
chamber, where ſhutting the dore, he began to walk a great pace, ſo much out of
himſelf, as he knew not either what he did, or where he was: then after he had
walked ſeveral turns, and thinking none could hear, he began to ſpeak with a loud
voice in this manner: Muſt <hi>Dorinde</hi> be enjoyed by another, and <hi>Merindor</hi> ſit tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and endure it? Can the authority of a Tyrant prevail above all my ſervices, and
moſt unjuſtly take that from me which is my due? Is there no remedy againſt this
wrong, and I with hazard of life and limb not make uſe of it? And here making a
ſudden ſtop, he began to ſay, muſt this depriver of my happineſs, have it to himſelf
at any other rate then the price of my blood and life? No, no, if I live, he muſt dye;
that's poſitive: <hi>Dorinde</hi> was in the right, when ſhe ſaid there was no remedy but
death. But (ſaid he, as much enraged as at the firſt) if it be ſo, why do I ſtay any
longer? And why do I not put my hand to a work that muſt inevitably be done?
Do it then <hi>Merindor</hi> quickly, unleſſe thou hadſt rather turn the ſword againſt
thy ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Merindor</hi> thought he had been alone in his chamber; and that there was none to
hear him but wals; but as good luck was, his Wiſe and moſt dear friend <hi>Euphroſias,</hi>
being come a little before to ſeek him, was ſaid down upon the bed in expectation of
him, and falling a ſleep, did not wake till <hi>Merindor</hi> began to talk loud; ſo as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in ſuch a fury, he was deſirous to know the cauſt, and let him empty his
heart by the words which he uttered: knowing very well, that to ſtop the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
of our ſouls at the firſt guſh, will make the deluge bigger; and to oppoſe
fury in the firſt, does but inflame it the more. But when he ſaw him ready to go
and execute what he had ſpoken, he ſtarted up, and took hold of his arm, deſiring
him to hear him ſpeak: <hi>Merindor,</hi> not knowing whether it was a man or a ſpirit, he
was ſtruck with ſuch a fright, that his fury was a little cooled; but recollecting his
ſpirits, and knowing him to be his dear friend; Oh my God! ſaid he, <hi>Euphroſias,</hi>
from whence come you? Come, come, ſaid his prudent friend, let us walk a turn

curioſity and wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then he continued; Is it poſſible <hi>Merindor</hi> that the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
which is betwixt us, can ſuffer you to run into ſuch extream reſolutions without
imparting them unto me, and without making uſe of me? Do you think I do not
Love you? Or do you take me for ſuch an uſeleſs thing, that in affairs of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
I neither will nor can ſerve you? Why? (ſaid <hi>Merindor</hi>) ſhould you uſe
any ſuch language? Becauſe, ſaid he, I heard all you ſaid, and the dangerous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
which you were going to execute without imparting it unto me. Do you
think I know not how the King intends to marry <hi>Dorinde</hi> unto <hi>Bellimartes?</hi> And
that her Father conſents unto it? Why man, it is all the Town talk, and I came hither
to acquaint you, if you were not acquainted with it before, to the end you might
reſolve with your ſelf, not only unto the Kings will, but alſo unto the will of God,
againſt which there is no reſiſtance: for <hi>Merindor,</hi> you muſt know that marriages
are made in Heaven, and accompliſhed upon earth. How, how? ſaid <hi>Merindor</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:53527:177"/>
haſtily, do you ſay that marriages are made in Heaven? There is no doubt on it,
anſwered <hi>Euphroſias,</hi> and thereupon it is, that ſo many unexpected marriages come
to paſſe. I aſſure you, if it be ſo (ſaid <hi>Merindor</hi>) it may be ſaid, that as bad a
market may be made in Heaven as in Earth; but from this, I do not conclude that
<hi>Bellimartes</hi> muſt enjoy <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and <hi>Merindor</hi> live; It muſt be concluded, replied
<hi>Euphroſias,</hi> that whatſoever the Heavens will ordain for you, muſt be done: but
tell me <hi>Merindor,</hi> what is your deſign? To take away his life (anſwered he) that
takes away all my contentment. But (ſaid <hi>Euphroſias</hi>) What will that advantage
you? Oh (ſaid the young Cavalier) revenge is ſweet. Revenge, replied the Wiſe
friend, is indeed very ſweet, when it does not make the offence greater; but if you
ſhould kill <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> the leaſt puniſhment you can expect, is baniſhment from all
places where <hi>Gondebaut</hi> has any power; and if ſo, what will become of your Love
unto <hi>Dorinde?</hi> Will not then this revenge make your offence which you receive,
greater? I do not hold him wiſe, who to put one of his enemies eyes out, will put
out both his own. What then, ſaid <hi>Merindor,</hi> muſt I ſit down tamely without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment,
and ſee <hi>Bellimartes</hi> enjoy that which in right ought to be mine? I do
not ſay ſo, anſwered <hi>Euphroſias,</hi> but on the contrary; but if you will be ruled by
me, I hope, we ſhall obtain for you, this ſo much deſired <hi>Dorinde.</hi> Do you think
that the King is ſo paſſionate in behalf of <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> as that he would do you any
harm? No, no, it is only to gratifie <hi>Bellimartes</hi> in a buſineſs wherein he does not
think any has any intereſt but <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> and of him the King makes no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
though he be one of the chief in all the Country, becauſe he is old and not
able to ſerve him, and on the contrary, <hi>Bellimartes</hi> is young, and may: for you muſt
know, that moſt Princes do with their Subjects, as we do with our horſes, when they
are old and unſerviceable, then turn them to the cart; believe it <hi>Merindor,</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
put a great difference between thoſe that are young and able to ſerve them, and
thoſe that are antiquated and cannot. This conſideration moves me to think, that
if you did acquaint the King with the Intereſt you have in the buſineſs, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
it: and you ſhall ſee, that though this courſe ſhould not do any good, yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will not do you any hurt.</p>
                     <p>The Wiſe <hi>Euphroſias,</hi> ſaid all theſe things before him, not that he believed they
would do any good, or that the King being engaged by his word, would be taken
off it; but his drift only was, to cool a little that angry heat which was kindled in the
ſoul of <hi>Merindor;</hi> hoping, that if the firſt impetuoſity were but a little allayed, he
might the more eaſily afterwards perſwade him to reaſon. And indeed, it came ſo
to paſs, that <hi>Merindor</hi> conſidering upon what he had ſaid, and finding ſome colour
of probability in it, he began to hearken a little unto reaſon: and in concluſion,
they did not part until he reſolved abſolutely to follow whatſoever <hi>Euphroſias</hi> did

amongſt themſelves, to imploy thoſe about the King, whom they thought had
moſt credit with him: this Wiſe friend made every thing look with ſuch a face of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
as wrought much upon the young mans apprehenſions; and he promiſed
unto him ſeveral aſſiſtances of great prevalency, though all was only to divert him:
for he knew that the beſt way to perſwade, is to infuſe great hopes of that which is
much deſired.</p>
                     <p>But Madam, I beſeech you hear how Heaven is pleaſed to play with men, and
how fortune does even what ſhe pleaſeth; when <hi>Merindor</hi> made addreſſes to the
King, and humbly beſeeched him he would not force <hi>Arcingentorix</hi> to give his
daughter unto <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> becauſe of the intereſt which he had; King <hi>Gondebaut</hi>
anſwered, that he did not know of his Intereſt, when he firſt engaged himſelf in the
buſineſs: but being now ſo far engaged, he knew not how to come off, without
much prejudice unto his Authority. So, ſee how <hi>Merindor</hi> is blaſted in all his hopes
on that ſide; and <hi>Bellimartes</hi> ſo aſſured to be my Husband, that the Articles were
drawn; and nothing wanted but going to the Temple. Who would ever think this
buſineſs ſhould be broken off? But ſee the black malice, and extream per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

men? When all things were ready, and every one in order to go unto the Temple,
a grave Honourable Matron, accompanied with two daughters and four ſervants,
came to the door of our houſe, and with much ado got paſſage through the croud
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53527:178"/>
of people which flocked thither, ſhe deſired to ſpeak with my Father; and after
civil ſaluation, Sir, (ſaid ſhe unto him, and raiſed her voice that all might hear) I
come to acquaint you, that my daughter whom I hold here in my hand, and whoſe
name is <hi>Alderina,</hi> is the Legitimate wife of <hi>Bellimartes</hi> the <hi>Viſigot;</hi> and that four
years have paſſed ſince he publiquely married her in <hi>Gergovia,</hi> as all the <hi>Druides</hi> and
Nobles of that Province can atteſt, and as I will make appear before the King, at
whoſe feet I am now going to proſtrate my ſelf, in hopes of Juſtice, and that the
Common Right of Nations will be maintained and obſerved. Upon this, ſhe made
a reverence, and went ſtraight to the Palace Royal, not without great ſhouts of the
people, when they heard this news.</p>
                     <p>Whether <hi>Arcingentorix</hi> was aſtoniſhed, judge you; for he was ſtruck into ſuch an
extaſie, that he was not able to utter one word: but going into the Hall, where we
all were ready to go out, and asking for <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> Sir, (ſaid he unto him aloud)
do you know a Lady whoſe name is <hi>Alderina?</hi> At the word <hi>Alderina,</hi> we obſerved
that he changed colour: why, (ſaid he) do you ask that queſtion? Becauſe, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
my Father) ſhe and her Mother are at the door, and do let you know, that
they are going to the King for Juſtice againſt you. Againſt me, ſaid he, and why?
Becauſe, anſwered my Father, this <hi>Alderina</hi> is your wife, and becauſe you cannot
marry another, as long as ſhe is alive. Upon this, a great noiſe of aſtoniſhment
was heard, which was made by all thoſe in the Hall: and though <hi>Bellimartes</hi> made
a laughing matter of it, and ſaid, it was not true, nor ought to retard the marriage,
yet none of my kindred were of that opinion, eſpecially my Father, who told him
freely, that he had ſuch a belief in what the woman ſaid, as he would never conſent
his daughter ſhould marry him, till this impoſture was cleered. <hi>Bellimartes</hi> who
was naturally of a proud imperious temper, and thought himſelf ſupported by the
Kings favour; let me tell you <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> ſaid he, that I care neither for you nor
your daughter, and that I do find my ſelf much miſtaken in the alliance which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make with you. My Father, who was generous, and though age hung
heavy upon him, yet could reſent the honour of himſelf and his Anceſtors, <hi>Bellimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
ſaid he unto him, I had rather you ſhould deceive your ſelf then me; and let
me tell you, that I value you far leſs then you can do my daughter or me. As God
would have it, <hi>Bellimartes</hi> never heard theſe laſt words, for he was gone all in a rage,
and left all the company in a ſtrange confuſion. But for his part, he was in the
greateſt confuſion of all; becauſe his conſcience, which is a thouſand witneſſes, did
convince him of that unworthy act which he would have done. This hour, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
was the happieſt of all my life: for certainly if this Lady had ſtayed but this
hour longer then ſhe did, I had been married unto him: and moſt certain it is, this
perfidious wretch had a wife, and as we are informed ſince, had quitted her, becauſe
ſhe was not rich enough: But ſee here, what the faith of men is? And how miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that woman is who truſts them; for this <hi>Alderina</hi> had been long courted by him,
and with ſo many paſſionate expreſſions of affection, as it is hardly credible he ſhould
forſake her: yet avarice did ſince moſt ſhamefully overcome his Love. But ſo it
was Madam, that for this time, I was almoſt miraculouſly delivered from a miſ-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
for <hi>Alderina,</hi> having made her addreſſes to the King, and convinced <hi>Bellimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
who though he denied all, yet he was ordained to take her for his Lawful wife;
and charged upon ſevere penalty, to marry no other, as long as ſhe lived: many did
wonder that <hi>Alderina</hi> being very fair and handſom, <hi>Bellimartes</hi> ſhould leave her
for me, whoſe face was enough to affright him: and when anſwer was made that he
did it out of covetouſneſs, it was hard to be believed, becauſe of the many rich
preſents which he ſent unto us, and which ſince we ſent back: but they did not
conſider that thoſe gifts, which made him thought liberal, they were not given, but
only lent, which he knew well enough would return back if he married me, ſince
then all we had was his: ſo as this ſo much eſteemed liberality, was moſt certainly a
baſe and unworthy ſelf ended avarice. <hi>Merindor</hi> who was going upon his laſt, and
was fully reſolved that when all hope was paſt, to kill himſelf, but yet to ſend <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes</hi>
out of the world before him, he was not the laſt man that was advertiſed of
this accident; and as if a new life had been given unto him, he leaped up, clapping
his hands together, and bleſſing the Fates for this happy fortune: then leaving his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53527:178"/>
chamber, he made all the haſte that poſſibly he could unto mine, where he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
himſelf the moſt joyful man alive, and asked an hundred merry queſtions: He
asked me how I did after my marriage? and whether it was good to be two wives to
one Husband; and becauſe I knew not well whether I ſhould laugh or cry, I ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, well, well <hi>Merindor,</hi> do not mock at me, perhaps when you are married,
you may alſo find a wife that has two husbands. If I have (ſaid he) the ſtronger will
drive the other out of the houſe; but I fear not any ſuch accident will ever befal me,
unleſs it be by you. By me? anſwered I, Nay, <hi>Merindor,</hi> the reſolution which I
have, will free you from that fear; for within theſe few days, if my Father will give
me leave, I will become of thoſe that are to keep in the Sacred Fire. How, how?
replied he, will you become a Veſtal? Yes certainly (ſaid I) purpoſely to be rid of men,
amongſt whom I find nothing but deceit and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>fidie. You do wrong me (ſaid he)
not to put me out of the general number, ſince I am ſure you never ſaw any action,
or heard any language from me, which was derogatory from my vowed affection, or
which in any reaſon could induce you to put me into that rank: One indeed, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, does make no number; but what do you ſay of <hi>Theombres,</hi> of <hi>Hylas,</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander,</hi>
and of <hi>Bellimartes?</hi> I ſay (anſwered he) that they deſerve not only to be
razed out of the rank of men, but alſo out of the number of the living: But I ſay,
that all men ought not to be blamed for them, and of all men, eſpecially <hi>Merindor.</hi>
Oh Madam, give me leave to tell you, it is moſt extream injuſtice to puniſh a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of innocents for a few culpable; and ſince faults are perſonal, every perſon ought
to bear the burthen of his own puniſhment. I muſt confeſs <hi>Merindor,</hi> ſaid I unto
him, that you are in the right, but I am not to be blamed; for having found ſo
much falſhood and perfidie in all thoſe that ever made any addreſſes unto me, I had
good reaſon to fear the ſame from all others. This <hi>Dorinde</hi> (ſaid he) is a ſecond
wrong, not inferiour to the firſt; for you rank me in the number of thoſe who have
deceived you, ſince you cannot exclude me from the number of thoſe who have
made addreſſes unto you. Hitherto (replied I,) I cannot ſay I have been deceived
by you; but I cannot tell what you may do upon occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt we were talking thus, my Father came into the chamber, ſtill much moved
at the former accident; and ſeeing this young Cavalier with me, Come <hi>Merindor</hi>
(ſaid he unto him) are you not much offended againſt my Daughter and me, for the
fault which the Kings power cauſed us to commit? Sir (anſwered <hi>Merindor</hi>) I am
more your ſervant, then to be offended at you; but on the contrary, I thank the
Gods for making the vilany of that wicked man known unto you; though let me tell
you, that if his vilany had been executed, the Vilain ſhould not have lived an hour
after; for I ſwear by the great God <hi>Ifeſus,</hi> this ſword ſhould have waſhed away
his crime with his own blood, for not one ſingle drop ſhould have remained: But
Sir, thanks be to God that there is no need of ſuch extremities; and remember I
beſeech you for the future, that our old Fathers had good reaſon to ſay, That no
man ought to rub an herd which he knows not: And Sir, there are many in this
Province whoſe Anceſtors and Eſtates are known unto you; and who would think
themſelves honoured and happy in your Alliance: And if heaven would make me ſo
happy as to obtain that favour, what ſervices (ſaid he, and kneeled down) would I
not pay unto you all my life, and what love, what duty and affection ſhould not
<hi>Dorinde</hi> receive from me? <hi>Dorinde</hi> I ſay, whom you know I ever loved and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
what accidents ſoever hapned. The good old man who knew how affectionate
he alwaies appeared, even all the time of my ſickneſs, and ſeeing him ſtill continue his
paſſionate expreſſions, he did believe him. But, oh Heavens! who might not as
well have been deceived as he? <hi>Merindor</hi> (ſaid he unto him) ſpeak freely and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly,
as you are a Cavalier; Are you real, or is it only out of your civility and
courtſhip that you uſe theſe expreſſions? Sir, anſwered he, I cannot commit an act
ſo unworthy of the name I bear, as to diſſemble or deceive; and therefore I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
and ſwear, that all the words which I have ſpoke, do proceed from the real
thoughts of my heart, with all ſincerity and true meaning, elſe may <hi>Bellinus</hi> root
me and my name out from the number of men. If ſo, replied <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> and
that it prove ſo that <hi>Bellimartes</hi> has another wife, and that your mother do conſent
unto your deſires, I do promiſe you <hi>Dorinde</hi> for your wife, and I do call the Gods to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53527:179"/>
be a witneſs unto the promiſe which now I make unto you. And I (added <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>)
do call all the Gods to witneſs, that I do receive this promiſe as the greateſt
happineſs I can deſire: for hence forward, I do devote my ſelf unto you Sir, as my
Lord and Father; and unto <hi>Dorinde</hi> as my Lady and Miſtreſs, and I do vow and
ſwear unto you both, an affection without end, and perpetual obedience. Who
would have thought, that heard theſe ſolemn proteſtations expreſſed which ſo much
freeneſs, but that they proceeded from his heart? But alas, ſo they did: I confeſs
they did proceed from his heart, but it was from the moſt wicked, vile, perfidious
heart, that ever was in any traiterous and perjured man: certainly it is enough to
expreſſe him, to ſay that he is a man without any addition of traiterous, or perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or perjured; for I do believe all others that bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are ſo. Now this man, according to the nature and cuſtom of all others, went
from us in appearance full of contentment, as full as man could be, and went unto
the Palace to hear more certain news of <hi>Alderina</hi> and of her marriage: at night he
returned again, and told us that the King having ſeen the atteſtations of the <hi>Druids</hi>
and Nobles of <hi>Gergovia,</hi> was highly offended againſt <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to depart his Dominions, and never to come into his preſence again;
yet ſome Grandees about <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> were in hope to obtain, his Pardon, when the
King his choller was a little over: and ſo it hapned; for a while after, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
by the mediation of <hi>Alderina</hi> her ſelf; who fell down at the feet of <hi>Gonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut,</hi>
who pardoned her Husbands fault, upon condition he would live with her as
he ought:</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe things hapned, it ſeems the Gods were pleaſed to mock <hi>Periander,</hi>
for the ſpring coming on, and ſome remedies which a Phiſitian gave me, did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
my complexion and features, that it was much better then before; and indeed
my companions, ſaid ſhe unto the three ſtrangers, I believe you will confeſſe it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then ever you ſaw it before: but ſo it hapned, that as my deformity did chaſe
away <hi>Periander</hi> from me ſo my recovery called him back.</p>
                     <p>I cannot expreſs the joy and contentment of <hi>Merindor,</hi> when from day to day, he
ſaw my complexion return: and not being able (as he ſaid) to endure any longer
delay in our marriage, he entreated my Father to give him conſent that he might
go unto his Mother for hers, there being nothing elſe which could hinder it. Oh
Heavens what new proteſtations did he make to my Father and me when he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I have wondred ſince a hundred times, that the earth did not open and ſwallow
him alive.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould but trouble you, Madam, did I relate the whole ſeries of his actions:
but ſo it was, that going away, he loſt all memory of me, and all his oaths: about
three months after his departure, he ſent one of his Brothers unto me with a Letter,
which I will read unto you, for I keep it ſtill about me, to convince him of his falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and perjury: then putting her hand into her pocket, ſhe pulled out a paper,
and read theſe words:</p>

ſhould write ſuch a Letter unto me? For if he had quitted me, one would have
thought in all reaſon, that he ſhould have done it when I was ugly and deformed, as
<hi>Periander</hi> did: but that he ſhould with ſuch aſſiduity abide the horror of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe;
that he ſhould never care for any deformity in my face, but even then to

court me with ſuch violence and zeal, and then to leave me when my Beauty was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
and when I thought nothing could ſeparate us, but his own will, or rathe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity:
this ſeems to be againſt the grain of all reaſon in the World. And I muſt needs
confeſs the truth, this action did go ſo neer unto my heart, that I vowed never
hence-forward to truſt any man living; but to flye and ſhun all ſuch as bore the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Dorinde</hi> would have continued, had not the noiſe of men on horſe-back, diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
them: theſe Fair Shepherdeſſes being unaccuſtomed to ſee ſuch aſſemblies in
their Villages, they all ran out of curioſity to the door: <hi>Dorinde</hi> and the other
ſtrangers did the ſame; then they ſaw paſſe along the way, which joyned almoſt
cloſe to the door of this Cabin, fifteen or ſixteen perſons very well mounted, and
armed, alter the <hi>Burgundian</hi> faſhion, having head-pieces upon their heads, Suits of
Arms for back and breſt, a Javelin in their right hands, and a Buckler on their left
arm. Theſe men marched in order, and in the head of them was him who condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them, as might be imagined, both by the goodneſſe of his Horſe, which was
much fairer then the reſt, and by the richneſs of his Armor, which was almoſt all
gilt, and a Plume in his Head-piece, which made him remarkable above the reſt.
This Troop marched very faſt, and their Armor and Horſes ſeet made a great noiſe:
as for the men they talked not loud, though they did hold ſome diſcourſe which
could not any diſtance be underſtood. When they came neer unto this Cabin, they
caſt their eyes upon theſe Shepherdeſſes, which out of curioſity were come to the
door, and ſeeing them ſo Fair, they ſtayed a little, almoſt raviſhed to ſee ſuch Fair
Faces in ſuch rural Cottages. Oh Heavens, cryed he that commanded them, is not
yonder <hi>Dorinde?</hi> She, hearing her ſelf named, and looking him in the face, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
remembred that ſhe had ſeen him very often with King <hi>Gondebaut:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fearing ſome violence, ſhe retired into the Cabin, to try if ſhe could hide her
ſelf: but he, being more aſſured by this action that it was ſhe, did preſently alight,
and five or ſix of his companions with him: and entring very bluſteringly amongſt
theſe women, they came to the place where <hi>Dorinde</hi> was retired; who trembling
for fear, and hiding her face with her hands, ſhe looked as pale as death. <hi>Celadon</hi>
in the dreſſe of <hi>Druide,</hi> wiſhed now that he had Arms, to repulſe the injury which
theſe ſtrangers ſeemed to offer unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and not being able to endure any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53527:180"/>
ſhould be done unto her in his preſence, he firſt uſed entreaties and fair lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
and ſeeing them ſlighted, and offers made to carry away that trembling
woman out of the Cabin, he could not chuſe but joyn hands unto his language, and
beyond the ſtrength of a woman, like man, reſiſt this violence. The Captain and the
Souldiers would quickly have diſpatched him, had they believed him to be a man,
but thinking him to be a woman <hi>Druide,</hi> their reſpect unto that ſex, and the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
they bore unto her habit, made them take it into their conſideration. All the
reſt of the women, ſeeing this attempt of the <hi>Druide,</hi> after her example, did their
endeavours to ſave <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and perhaps this feeble defence, had held them long in
play, had not the Captain being grown into choller, made a ſign unto the Souldiers,
that without any conſideration of theſe women, they ſhould uſe force, and carry
her away. As <hi>Celadon</hi> was holding the arms of this man ſo as he could not ſtir, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea</hi>
and <hi>Diana</hi> were on both ſides of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and held her by the arms; but the
Souldiers who had received the ſign from their Commander, puſhing them both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
roughly away, they conſtrained theſe Shepherdeſſes to let their hold go, and
with ſuch violence that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> fell to the ground. Who crying out, and the <hi>Druide</hi>
turning about her head, ſeeing her ſo unworthily uſed, ſhe grew as furious as any
raging <hi>Lyon,</hi> and letting him go whom ſhe held, and ran upon him who did the
affront with ſuch violence, and gave him ſuch a blow upon the face, as ſhe conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him to let <hi>Dorinde</hi> go, who was already pulled out of the door, and after he
had reeled two or three paces, he fell amongſt the horſes feet, which trampled him
ſo, as he was not able to do more harm unto this fair company: the Captain in the
mean time being out of the <hi>Druids</hi> hands, and ſeeing they had carried <hi>Dorinde</hi> out
of the place, he went out alſo, to ſee her carried away according to his deſign:
but when he was out, he ſaw his companions on foot, and running after her in the
fields: for fear made her ſo ſwift, as ſhe ſeemed to have wings at her heels. At the
firſt, he laughed, for he confidently believed ſhe would be taken again. But whilſt
he was looking and laughing at this chaſe, for ſo may the flight of <hi>Dorinde</hi> be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
they ſaw appear ſix Cavaliers, who being very well mounted and armed, came
riding the ſame way. At the firſt, they rid in file, as Travellers uſe in a Journey;
but when they ſaw ſo many men running after one woman, they drew up together,
and galloped to oppoſe the violence which they thought would be done unto her.
Yet they could not come in ſo ſoon, but <hi>Dorinde</hi> was firſt taken; and becauſe ſhe
had no other defence, they ſaw her fall down upon her knees, hold up her hands,
and make lamentable prayers and ſupplications to them. The Souldiers, on the
other ſide, without any compaſſion, took her, and would have carried her away:
when theſe Cavaliers came up unto them, they out of pity, though they knew not
<hi>Dorinde,</hi> oppoſed this violence; but one of them upon a ſudden caſting his eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, did know her: Oh ye crew of villains (ſaid he unto the Souldiers) and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to bear arms, ſince you imploy them ſo ill; ceaſe wronging her whom ye
all ought to honour and ſerve, or elſe by Heaven (ſaid he, and drew his ſword) I
will chaſtiſe you according to your merits. Sir, (anſwered one of them) King <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debaut</hi>
commanded us to do what we have done, and none ought or can oppoſe his
will. Upon this, not caring for the menace of the Cavalier, and ſeeing him ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
accompanied, alſo his Captain and company coming to his relief, he
continued on his way: at which the Cavalier was ſo incenſed, that he gave him ſuch
a blow upon the ſhoulder, that for all his Coat of Male, it gave him a deep wound,
and being a little diſtant from <hi>Dorinde,</hi> he rid upon him with his horſe, and trod
him to the ground. In the mean time, the reſt of the Cavaliers advanced againſt the
Captain, and his Souldiers, who without any expoſtulations, did aſſault them very
furiouſly. The Cavaliers being better armed, and better mounted, and having more
courage, though they were interior in number, yet gave them ſuch a hot ſalute that
the combat did not laſt above a quarter of an hour: for the Captain being killed, the
reſt were quickly routed, and fled ſome one way, and ſome another, as faſt as ever their
horſes could carry them. This victory was the ſooner gotten, by reaſon that moſt
of one party was on foot, and were running after their horſes, which were broken
looſe in the fields. But of theſe ſix Cavaliers, two of them were killed, and one ſo
wounded that he could hardly ſit his horſe.</p>

                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:53527:180"/>
                        <hi>Dorinde</hi> ſeeing this unlook'd for relief, although ſhe thought ſhe knew the voice
of him who ſpoke, yet not being ſure, becauſe his head-piece covered his face, ſhe
retired as faſt as ſhe could in a trembling and panting pace unto her companions,
though not ſo much affrighted as when ſhe was firſt ſeized upon: But when ſhe was
told of the end of the combate, for ſhe was gotten into the cabbin, and that one of
the Cavaliers who defended her was much wounded, ſhe went out of the cabin with
watry eyes and cheeks to receive him and help him all that poſſibly ſhe could: And
becauſe his three companions took off his helmet to give him Ayr, as ſoon as ſhe caſt
her eye upon him, ſhe knew him to be <hi>Bellimartes;</hi> at which ſhe was ſo ſurprized,
that ſhe knew not whether ſhe dream'd or waked: But whilſt the three Cavaliers
were laying him upon the Bed, and one of them ſtayed with him, the other two pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
off their helmets, and kneeled down before her, ſhewing all ſigns of humble
obedience; ſhe all the while was ſo ſurprized at the ſight of them, that ſhe could
not utter a word; for the one was <hi>Merindor,</hi> and the other <hi>Periander.</hi> Oh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!
(cryed ſhe out at the laſt, when ſhe could ſpeak) Oh heavens! Is it poſſible
I ſhould be thus much obliged unto three men, who have made me hate all men liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for their ſakes? <hi>Merindor</hi> then began firſt to ſpeak: Oh <hi>Dorinde</hi> (ſaid he unto
her) do not by your disfavours leſſen that contentment which heaven has given us,
in rendring you a teſtimony that we do love you more then you would be loved by
us. After this, <hi>Periander</hi> continued, Heaven (fair <hi>Dorinde</hi>) has made choice of us,
to render you this little ſervice; and believe, that the choice could not be made of
any others, who have vowed ſo much affection as we: Receive, we moſt humbly
beſeech you, the willingneſs we have to expoſe our lives in repulſing that violence
which was offered unto you. I do proteſt, ſaid <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and turned his
head towards her, I ſhall leave this world the moſt contented man that is in it,
ſince I have loſt my life in your ſervice; and if you will have me think my death more
welcome then ever was my life, fair <hi>Dorinde,</hi> Do but only ſay, Go in peace <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dorinde</hi> turning her eyes upon <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and ſeeing a mortal paleneſs in his
face, ſhe only embraced <hi>Merindor</hi> and <hi>Periander,</hi> and not having leiſure to ſpeak
unto them, ſhe ran unto <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> who expreſſed ſuch ſigns of perfect content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as every one obſerved an alteration in his eyes and countenance; but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when ſhe took his hand, and ſaid unto him; If heaven hath decreed that you
muſt end your days in this relief which your Valour has given me, be aſſured <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes,</hi>
that it ſhall never be forgotten; and if it be the pleaſure of the Gods, as I
ſhall pray it may, to prolong your life unto my contentment, be confident that I
will never be ungrateful unto <hi>Bellimartes.</hi> Madam (ſaid he, and forced himſelf to
ſpeak) to give you my life, which is ſo much your due, deſerves no recompence: but
I beſeech you accept alſo of my ſoul, which I do moſt religiouſly devote unto you,
and will never take it out of the fair hands of <hi>Dorinde:</hi> Upon this he would have kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her hand, but he wanted ſtrength; for he grew pale and cold, and immediately
died in the arms of that Cavalier who held him in the bed, and whoſe tears and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
made all beholders pity him.</p>
                     <p>This laſt action of <hi>Bellimartes</hi> did ſo mollifie the heart of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the fault which he had committed againſt her, and reviving the memory of that
affection which by ſo many addreſſes he had expreſſed unto her, ſhe could not chuſe
but accompany his death with tears of compaſſion and amity; an office which ſhe
continued long in performing, and had continued longer, if the company, moved
unto pity, had not removed her by force from the Corps; ſo ſeeing her ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to leave him, Adieu <hi>Bellimartes</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto his corps) if thou didſt think
it a happineſs to have my love, go contented into the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, &amp; be aſſured, that
thou art happier in thy death then in thy life. Theſe expreſſions were accompanied
with tears, to teſtifie they were real, and that he had gotten her love in dying, more
then he could have obtained by living.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt all theſe things thus paſſed, a great number of Shepherds in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Vilages came running with Pike-ſtaves, and ſuch Arms as they uſed in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſome brought Bows and Arrows, ſuch as they uſed at their general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
in the Forreſt of <hi>Iſoures,</hi> and other meetings: ſo as in a little time there was a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53527:181"/>
great Army about this little Cabin: Their aſtoniſhment was not a little when they
heard of the violence which was offered unto that fair ſtranger by the firſt company,
and when they heard of the relief which the laſt brought her ſo opportunely; and
their wonder was more yet, when they ſaw thoſe marks which the Cavaliers left of
their courage and valour. <hi>Merindor</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> ſeeing <hi>Dorinde</hi> in the hands of
the <hi>Druide</hi> and Shepherdeſſes, they thought it fit to leave her a little to dry up her
tears, whilſt in the mean time they went to pay that office unto their dead compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which the ſurvivors were obliged unto; and the more, becauſe <hi>Periander</hi> had
loſt a coſin german, and <hi>Merindor</hi> a brother, whom they exceedingly loved. Leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore the other Cavalier with the corps of <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> they went out of the
cabin, accompanied with many Shepherds, and went afterwards amongſt the dead
to look for their kinred: They found them both cloſe by one another; the one was
run through with a Javelin which pierced his heart, and <hi>Merindor</hi>'s brother lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his horſe with a wound given by a ſword through his breaſt; but as a note of
their valour, four dead enemies did lie about theſe two, who held their ſwords ſtill
in their hands, with viſages which ſeemed to threaten as well dead as alive.</p>
                     <p>The griefs and lamentation of <hi>Merindor</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> were indeed very great,
and had been greater, if ſome <hi>Druides</hi> had not at the ſame time come thither; and
this great number of people were ſent by their authority to appeaſe the tumult, as
upon ſuch occaſions they uſed to do. Theſe <hi>Druides</hi> underſtanding the juſt and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
defence which thoſe Cavaliers had made in relieving this ſtranger; after that
they had highly commended them, and in the name of the Country given them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thanks, they endeavoured by all manner of ways to comfort them, and therefore
they deſired them to leave their immoderate grief, and alſo leave the care of their
friends interment unto them; which after many entreaties they permitted, but not
without embracing and kiſſing their dead kinred ſeveral times, and bidding them their
laſt farewel.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Druides</hi> being advertized that there was yet one of their companions dead in
the next cabin? they went and brought him thither, and there waſhed their Corps in
the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> afterwards interred them in the place where the combate was; and
laſtly, they raiſed up monuments of Earth upon their graves, and decked them with
all the rural Art that is imaginable. This Funeral ceremony was performed with ſo
much honour and order, that <hi>Merindor, Periander,</hi> and the Cavalier who was
friend unto <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> had reaſon in ſome degree to leſſen their mourning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dorinde</hi> during all the time of this ceremony, never ſtirred out of the cabin, becauſe
ſhe had not yet recollected her ſelf, nor was rid of her fears; The Shepherdeſſes
<hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> with the diſguiſed <hi>Druide,</hi> did keep <hi>Florice, Cercinea,</hi>
and <hi>Palinice</hi> company; all whom could not ſufficiently wonder at this unaccuſtomed
accident: And when <hi>Periander</hi> and <hi>Merindor</hi> returned to give an account of that
charitable office which they had performed, they, ſaw a Shepherd coming, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be in very great haſte; when he was a little nearer, he was known to be <hi>Hylas:
Periander</hi> no ſooner heard him named, but he cryed out; Oh God, ſaid he, is it
<hi>Hylas</hi> of the Iſle of <hi>Camargues,</hi> the beſt humored man alive, and the moſt jolly
companion? The very ſame, anſwered one of the <hi>Druides</hi> that came with them,
he has ſojourned in this Country ſeveral moneths; and he found every day ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as I do not think he will ever leave it. <hi>Periander</hi> then turning towards <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
Brother (ſaid he) I beſeech you go you unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and tell her, if ſhe ask
for me, that you left me with <hi>Hylas,</hi> I am confident ſhe will be very glad to hear it,
for I muſt needs go and meet and embrace him as one of my beſt friends: Upon this,
he went a great pace towards <hi>Hylas,</hi> who ſeeing him coming, did not know him, as
well becauſe of his Arms, as becauſe he little expected to find him in that place:
<hi>Periander</hi> held out his Arms, and embraced him, he not knowing that theſe careſſes
came from <hi>Periander.</hi> But when he ſaid unto him, Is it poſſible <hi>Hylas</hi> that you ſhould
be turned a Shepherd of Forreſts, and quite forget your good friends? His voice
made him know that face which he had forgotten, and therefore he took him about
the neck and kiſſed him, and was ſo tranſported with joy, that he ſeemed to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
out of himſelf. Then <hi>Periander</hi> ſaid unto him, ſee <hi>Hylas</hi> whether I have not
good reaſon to complain againſt your memory, that does not only forget me when
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53527:181"/>
I am abſent but alſo when I am preſent; but I am glad to ſee you, and to teſtifie
how really I love you, I am come to ſee you, accompanied with one whom you
love the beſt of any in the world. <hi>Periander</hi> (anſwered <hi>Hylas</hi>) I pray diſtinguiſh
what kind of one you ſpeak? It is a man or a woman? For if it be a man, none can
be more welcom unto me then your ſelf, ſince there is none I love better then I do
<hi>Periander;</hi> and if it be a woman, then, if it be ſhe I love beſt, you have met with
<hi>Stella,</hi> for it is ſhe unto whom I have devoted my ſelf. What? replied <hi>Periander,</hi>
have you forgotten <hi>Dorinde? Dorinde</hi> anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> I perceive my good friend,
that you have forgotten the cuſtom of <hi>Hylas;</hi> you muſt know, that her name has
hardly room in my memory: for ſince I have ſeen ſo many <hi>Creyſides,</hi> ſo many <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donthes,</hi>
ſo many <hi>Laonices,</hi> ſo many <hi>Philliſes,</hi> ſo many <hi>Alexiſes,</hi> and above all one
<hi>Stella,</hi> who dazles my eyes, I tell you the luſter of ſo many new lights, will not let
me ſee, the obſcurities of your City of <hi>Lyons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I perceive (ſaid <hi>Periander,</hi> and ſmiled) that you are ſtill the ſame <hi>Hylas,</hi> upon the
banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> that you were wont to be upon thoſe of <hi>Arar.</hi> The very ſame
(ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) but yet, if <hi>Dorinde</hi> be here, I ſhall be glad to ſee her, that I may know
whether my mouth was not in thoſe dayes out of taſte: If you deſire to ſee her, ſaid
<hi>Periander,</hi> you may go into that Cabin, and find her ſtill frighted, at an accident
which hapned: What accident? ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> it is, anſwered <hi>Periander,</hi> that but for
<hi>Bellimartes, Merindor,</hi> and my ſelf, ſome of King <hi>Gondebauts</hi> Souldiers would have
carried her away: but we finding her juſt in the very nick of time, we made them
quit their enterprize; but alas the poor <hi>Bellimartes</hi> is dead, with <hi>Merindor</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and I have loſt a Coſen germane. How? replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> have you thus hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
King <hi>Gondebaut</hi>'s men? If ſo, I beſeech you, carry me to <hi>Dorinde,</hi> for I muſt of
neceſſity advertiſe her of ſome things which I have heard, and which cauſed me to
come hither in ſuch haſte.</p>
                     <p>They were then cloſe by the Cabin, ſo as <hi>Hylas</hi> upon this entred, who ſeeing all
the Shepherdeſſes about the ſtranger, did judge her to be <hi>Dorinde;</hi> but faigning not
to know her: where is this new Shepherdeſs, ſaid he, who at her firſt coming has
ſtained the purity of our banks with bloody Sacrifices? <hi>Dorinde</hi> then knowing <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
roſe up to ſalute him, being very glad to meet him in that place, where ſhe
thought ſhe ſhould need all manner of aſſiſtance; and going towards him, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<hi>Hylas;</hi> ſaid ſhe, that my face ſhould be ſo changed, as your eyes ſhould not
know her now, whom your heart did formerly know ſo well? I believe, anſwered
<hi>Hylas,</hi> that if my heart were here, it might anſwer the queſtions which you ask, but
ſince it is not, I think there are few here who can tell what to ſay unto them. How?
ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> your heart not here? Who is the thief that ſtole it? As for any male
thieves, replied he, I know how to keep it well enough from them; but I muſt
confeſſe my bad influences has ſubmitted me unto ſome certain Female thieves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom I cannot poſſibly defend my ſelf: and the worſt is, they are of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that the firſt thing they ſeize upon is the heart, ſo as I can very ſeldom keep
this little piece of houſhold ſtuffe in my houſe. I believe, ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that when
theſe Femal thieves do ſteal it from you, it is not long before you can furniſh your
ſelf with another: You are miſtaken (ſaid <hi>Florice</hi> and interrupted) for thoſe who
do ſteal it, do find it ſuch a bad piece of ſtuff, that they preſently reſtore it back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at the next meeting: you are miſtaken your ſelf, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and you had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
have ſaid, that becauſe it is impoſſible two hearts ſhould dwell together, without
the ſtronger driving out the weaker, thoſe who do ſteal my heart, are conſtrained to
let theirs come unto me, and become mine, and ſtay with me until ſome other thief
do ſteal it from me to give me her own; and therefore <hi>Dorinde,</hi> if you have any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
for your heart, which you ſent unto me, when you ſtole mine, ask it of <hi>Florice;</hi>
and you <hi>Florice,</hi> ask yours of <hi>Cryſeide</hi> when you ſee her next: and let <hi>Cryſeide</hi> ask
hers of <hi>Madonthe;</hi> and if <hi>Madonthe</hi> will have that back, which I had of hers, let
her look out <hi>Laonice:</hi> and whoſoever has any thing to do with <hi>Laonices,</hi> they will
find it in <hi>Phillis:</hi> and you <hi>Phillis,</hi> if you deſire to have yours again to beſtow upon
any Shepherd, bid the Fair <hi>Druide</hi> return it unto you; for as for hers which I had,
it is now in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Stella,</hi> who in a happy exchange, did moſt courteouſly
give me hers, which I will keep as long as it pleaſeth me; but <hi>Dorinde,</hi> ſaid <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:53527:182"/>
and interrupted, I beſeech you let us diſcourſe upon theſe hearts another time
when we have more leiſure: <hi>Hylas</hi> comes to advertiſe you, that you are not ſafe in
this place, and therefore it is requiſite you hear what he ſays: you do very well, ſaid
<hi>Hylas,</hi> to put me in memory of it; for this new Shepherdeſs, does ſo put me in
mind of what is paſt, that I forget the preſent. Let me tell you therefore that not
long ſince, as I lay cloſe in a buſh expecting a Shepherdeſs whom I loved, and was
to walk that way with her Flock, I ſaw four men on horſ-back, terribly affrighted,
and in great diſorder; and one of them had a great cut upon his hand, which bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extreamly, conſtrained them to alight very near the place where I was; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left one to watch whether any followed, the other held the horſes, and the
third tore his handkerchief, gathered a little ground-moſſe, and applied it unto the
wound to ſtop the blood; in the mean time I heard one of them ſay, that if they
made a little more haſte, they ſhould meet with the reſt of their company from whom
they were parted; &amp; then they would return, and be revenged, by bringing away that
woman whom King <hi>Gondebaut</hi> ſo much deſired to have. As ſoon as they were gone,
I met with ſome Shepherds, who told me partly what had hapned in this place, unto
which I came purpoſely to tell you, that unleſs you have a mind to fall into their
hands, you muſt remove from this place. Oh ye Gods! (cryed out <hi>Dorinde</hi> with
tears in her eyes) will not fortune let me remain at reſt, even in theſe ſolitary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
Madam, ſaid <hi>Periander,</hi> when we came away from <hi>Lyons,</hi> we heard that you
were purſued by many of King <hi>Gondebauts</hi> guard; and therefore if you will take my
advice, you ſhall ſeek out ſome place of ſtrength for your ſecurity: as long as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindor</hi>
and I do live, we will defend you againſt all the world; but we being but
three, with this Cavalier that is friend unto <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> our lives may be taken away
by a multitude, and you injured, which is worſe then the loſſe of us. <hi>Licydas</hi> upon
this, who was come unto this place upon the noiſe, a little before <hi>Hylas.</hi> Madam,
ſaid he, we will all of us ſerve you, againſt all that ſhall offer you any injury; but
give me leave to tell you, that to avoid a mis-fortune, it were good you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
unto <hi>Marſelles,</hi> where your merits would meet with much honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
from all: the great Nymph <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and <hi>Galathea,</hi> will bid you welcom, and
defend you againſt all violence.</p>
                     <p>Every one did much approve of this advice; And becauſe <hi>Dorinde</hi> was unwilling
to put her ſelf into the hands of theſe Cavaliers by her ſelf alone, <hi>Florice, Cercinea,
Palinice,</hi> and <hi>Celidea,</hi> offered themſelves to accompany her, provided ſome Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
would go with them, becauſe they would not return alone. <hi>Hylas, Lycidas,
Thamires, Calidon</hi> and <hi>Corilas,</hi> did preſent themſelves very freely: and therefore
without more delay, after theſe ſtrangers had bid adieu unto <hi>Alexis, Diana, Aſtrea,</hi>
and <hi>Phillis,</hi> and the reſt of the Shepherdeſſes, they ſet forward: the three Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,
mounted and armed as when they came firſt, kept at a ſmall diſtance from the
company, in a poſture to defend them, if any came to aſſault them: and the reſt of
the Shepherds, helped the Shepherdeſſes to walk, whilſt <hi>Thamires</hi> helped his dear
<hi>Celidea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now all the company parted; <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> to accompany <hi>Alexis,</hi>
went towards the houſe of <hi>Phocion,</hi> becauſe it grew very late; and by the way, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
the accident that had hapned unto this ſtranger: I aſſure you, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,
Dorinde</hi> is leſſe beholding unto thoſe that love her, then to thoſe that do not; why?
ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> becauſe, anſwered ſhe, thoſe that do not love her, do not deceive her,
and thoſe that do, betray her: why good Siſter (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) do you not think that
all men are deceivers? Certainly you are deceived if you think otherwiſe: for believe
it for an infallible truth, that falſhood and treachery will be in the world as long as
there is one man in it. <hi>Alexis,</hi> who though in the habit of a woman, yet could not
ſhake off thoſe reſentments of a man which nature had infuſed; is it poſſible diſcreet
and Fair Shepherdeſs, (ſaid ſhe) that you ſhould think as you ſpeak? Is it poſſible
Madam, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> that you ſhould live to this age, and be ignorant of the
truth of which we ſpeak? That men ſhould be ſo bad as you ſay they are, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi>
and yet I not know it, is not ſtrange: for my education amongſt <hi>Druids</hi> has been ſo
retired from all men, that we do hardly know them further then by name: but yet
I cannot imagine that the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> who is all goodneſs, would ever give unto
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53527:182"/>
our ſex ſuch a bad companion as you repreſent him. I can anſwer you no otherwiſe
(ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) but that it is a ſecret reſerved to himſelf: and if it be lawful for me to
tell you what I think, I believe it is to make us exerciſe the virtue of Patience. Oh
Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I am not of your opinion, and I believe very few are: <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
replied <hi>Diana,</hi> how were you ſatisfied with <hi>Celadon?</hi> for my part anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
I had no reaſon to be ill ſatisfied with him you name, no more then you were with
<hi>Philander:</hi> I muſt needs confeſs, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I had no reaſon to be diſ-ſatisfied in
him, but I believe if he had lived longer, I might have been, for he was a man: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi>
hearing <hi>Celadon</hi> named, began to bluſh, and not daring to look upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea,</hi>
ſhe caſt her eyes upon the ground; but when ſhe heard her ſay that ſhe had
no reaſon to be more diſ-ſatisfied with <hi>Celadon,</hi> then <hi>Diana</hi> was with <hi>Philander,</hi> ſhe
was very deſirous to know what occaſions of diſ-ſatisfaction <hi>Philander</hi> had ever gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
her, to the end ſhe might know by that, what it was which his Shepherdeſſe
complained of: and ſeeing that <hi>Diana,</hi> did not anſwer any further, ſhe began:
But diſcreet Shepherdeſs (ſaid ſhe unto her) oblige me ſo far, I beſeech you, as to
tell me freely, what diſ-ſatisfaction you received from that Shepherd of whom you
ſpeak. Madam, anſwered ſhe, the diſcourſe would be too long and tedious for
your ears, and for me to relate. You may if you pleaſe, replied <hi>Celadon,</hi> epitomize
it in ſo ſhort a method, as will not be a trouble unto either. <hi>Phillis</hi> upon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
for her: Madam, ſaid ſhe, I beſeech you, pardon her from that whole dayes
work, which I aſſure you would weary her more then you imagine: I ſhould moſt
willingly ſatisfie your curioſity, and tell you what diſ-ſatisfaction <hi>Diana</hi> received from
that Shepherd; but that I know the bad fortune of <hi>Philander,</hi> made ſuch a wound in
the ſoul of <hi>Diana,</hi> as cannot be touched with never ſo delicate a hand, but it is ſo
ſenſible as will grieve her: but Siſter, ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Diana,</hi> pray tell me, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
have you againſt <hi>Lycidas?</hi> I ſay, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> that he is not yet dead
nor married, and that perhaps before either of theſe come to paſs, ſuch things may
fall out, as may give you occaſion to rank him in the Catalogue of men. Oh Siſter,
ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> who do you foretel ſuch things as cannot chuſe but infinitely diſpleaſe
me? and of which there is no appearance? But I ſee, a pallate out of taſte, makes all
viands ſeem bitter. Siſter, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> I know your meaning; but conſider, that
he is a man, and conſequently a deceiver: and when <hi>Merindor</hi> deceived <hi>Dorinde,</hi>
there was no appearance, nor no likelyhood he ſhould do ſo: and yet you ſee he
did. You muſt know, that deceipts, are not deceipts, unleſs they deceive the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of thoſe againſt whom they are done, and therefore they muſt be done ſo,
as there may be no appearance or thought of them before hand. For my part, ſaid
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who has no intereſt in theſe things you ſpeak of, I ought to be believed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
either of you, and therefore hearken unto my opinion: I do believe, that men
are not ſuch deceivers as many do think them, nor ſo faithful, as many have opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
they are. Good Servant (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) explain this riddle; Miſtris, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea,</hi>
my meaning is, that ſome men are deceivers, and ſome are not; all ought
not to be meaſured by one and the ſame ell; and that the virtues and vices of ſome,
ought not to be the honour, or diſ-honour of others: and therefore, thoſe who
have cauſe to complain againſt the infidelity of men, ought not to ſay poſitively
that they are all deceivers: nor thoſe who have full aſſurance of the fidelity
of ſome particular man, muſt not think, but that another may be unfaithfull.</p>
                     <p>Their Diſcourſe had laſted longer, had they not heard the voice of a Shepherd
ſinging, whom they preſently knew to be <hi>Sylvander:</hi> and coming a little neerer
the hedge where he ſate, they heard him repeat ſome verſes, which intimated that
he was not changed: <hi>Diana</hi> who was the firſt that heard him, would have drawn off
the company from hearing any further: but for all that, they would needs hear him
on: and then they heard him break out into theſe expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>Miſerable <hi>Sylvander</hi> (ſaid he with a deep ſigh) why doſt thou drone on this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
life, and has ſuch, and ſo much reaſon to die? Is it out of hopes of any better
Fortune? Ah fond man, is it not full time to undeceive thy ſelf, at leaſt, if thou haſt
any conſideration, any feeling, or any ſenſibility of thy unfortunate life? Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneſt
now to enter into the fifth luſter, ſince the miſerable day of thy birth; and
in ſo many nights, ſo many weeks, ſo many moneths, and ſo many years, canſt thou
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53527:183"/>
name one minute that was not remarkable for ſome misfortune or other? I cannot
indeed call that hour diſaſtrous in which I firſt ſaw <hi>Diana,</hi> ſince in her I ſaw all the
excellencies and perfection that Nature can give unto mortals: but was not that the
time that Fortune took a greater Empire over me then ever ſhe had before? For if
ſhe had any power over me before, it was only over my poor ſheep; and the little
ſtock which I had, but my ſoul was free, and exempt from blows and changes: But
oh ye Gods! ſince I ſaw this fair, this divinely fair <hi>Diana,</hi> my ſoul is a ſlave, and
from being inſenſible, is grown ſo weak and ſo ſubmiſs, that the leaſt Will of this
Shepherdeſs is a Law unto me, her commands are Oracles, and the leaſt twinkle of
her, commands ſo abſolute, that I would rather chuſe the worſt death, then diſobey
the leaſt ſhaddow of her Will: and is not this the very height of miſery, that all
my cares, all my ſervices, all my endeavours, and all my extream paſſions ſhould be
ſo many offences, and ſo many injuries unto her? If the Univerſe, and all that is
compriſed in it, be ruled and governed by reaſon, what reaſon is there, that I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no deſigne but to do her ſervice with all manner of affection and fidelity, that
ſhe ſhould make no return but hatred and ſcorn? Then making a ſtop, and ſtaying
mute a while, he began again: But oh ye Gods! I do underſtand this ſecret, or at
the leaſt I think I do; It is to puniſh me becauſe I have loved this divine <hi>Diana</hi> too
much, and have preferred my affection unto her, before that which I owed unto
you. But if it be ſo, give me leave with all reverence to expoſtulate a little with
you; why did you not make her with leſs perfection? For being as ſhe is, it were
a ſin to love her leſs then I do: But well (ſaid he with a profound ſigh) do your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and if you think good, double and redouble your puniſhment, for I cannot leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
or diminiſh one jot.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt <hi>Sylvander</hi> was talking thus to himſelf, <hi>Diana</hi> had got a good diſtance off,
and <hi>Phillis</hi> having no mind to leave her alone, did ſhow her unto <hi>Alexis</hi> and
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and whiſpered them in their ears, that if they intended to ſtay any longer, ſhe
would go and ſtay with her; but the <hi>Druide</hi> and her companion ſeeing it was
late, they thought it would be to no purpoſe to ſtay any longer in that place,
where they could not receive any better ſatisfaction of this Shepherds innocency then
they had; and therefore ſtealing off unperceived, they went as faſt as they could to
overtake <hi>Diana,</hi> unto whom they told all that they could in diſcharge of <hi>Sylvander.</hi>
But ſhe, ſeeming as if ſhe cared not, ſhe anſwered in ſuch a kind of neglective man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as if he were not <hi>Sylvander</hi> they talked of, or as if ſhe was not <hi>Diana</hi> whom
they talked to.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> admiring the ſtrength of <hi>Dianas</hi> ſpirit, knowing very well by experience
how hard a thing it is to reſiſt a domineering paſſion; I muſt confeſs, fair Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes
(ſaid ſhe) That I could never have met with any women ſuch abſolute Miſtiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of themſelves, nor men ſuch Lovers, as I ſee there are about the banks of <hi>Lignon.</hi>
Why do you ſay this? ſaid <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Becauſe ſervant (anſwered <hi>Alexis</hi>) hearing the
diſcourſe of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and the anguiſh he endures, it muſt be acknowledged that
he does love infinitely who can endure it. And with what coldneſs <hi>Diana</hi> does ſlight
it, I muſt needs confeſs and ſay, that in her alone, paſſion does ceaſe to be paſſion,
and become ſeeming reaſon. Madam, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> I beſeech you pardon me,
if I tell you, That you are miſtaken in both the judgements which you have given:
For as to that which relates unto me, believe it to be a very eaſie matter to carry it
as I do, having no intereſt at all in the buſineſs, as you think I have: And as to that
which relates unto the Shepherd, be aſſured, That not only about the Banks of
<hi>Lignon,</hi> but every place where the name of Love is known, men do ſtudy more to
diſguiſe and diſſemble their affections, then to render them real and great: They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
puft up bladders, which ſeem to be ſomthing that's big, whilſt they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but empty wind, and the leaſt prick of a pin diſcovers their empty imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Sage Shepherdeſs, replied the <hi>Druide,</hi> I do believe that you have more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
then I in the humours of thoſe you ſpeak of; but give me leave to tell you,
that <hi>Sylvander</hi> does love. I do believe it Madam, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> but it is <hi>Madon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the.</hi>
I do believe (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) that <hi>Sylvander</hi> does love, and that he does love none
but <hi>Diana.</hi> Then certainly (replied ſhe) <hi>Madonthe</hi> has changed her name, and
calls her ſelf <hi>Diana;</hi> and if you will not believe me, I will refer you unto <hi>Laonice.</hi>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:53527:183"/>
You will find ſaid (ſaid the <hi>Druide</hi>) in the end, that there is ſome ſecret miſtery in
the report of <hi>Laonice:</hi> for if it were ſo, that <hi>Sylvander</hi> did love <hi>Madonthe,</hi> why
ſhould he ſeem to love you? What benefit will accrue unto him by diſguiſing it?
To blind the eyes, anſwered ſhe, of the jealous <hi>Therſander:</hi> this might be ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Alexis,</hi> in the time of <hi>Therſander,</hi> and when <hi>Madonthe</hi> was here: but now
they are gone, to what purpoſe ſhould he ſo do? Oh Madam, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> did you
but know the humours of men, eſpecially of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> you would not make ſuch
a wonder at it: you muſt know that there is not a man under the cope of Heaven,
who deſires more to give a good opinion of himſelf then he; and this is the reaſon
that having made a ſhew of loving me formerly, he is now aſhamed his falſhood
ſhould be diſcovered: all his paſſionate expreſſions and behaviour which you ſee,
and think they proceed from affection, are but tricks and gloſſes which he uſes, out
of ſhame to be thought a diſſembler, and a man of no faith.</p>
                     <p>If he were aſhamed, as you object, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that ſhame would produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effects: for if he loved <hi>Madonthe,</hi> he would with all ſpeed flye from thoſe
places where his diſſimulation would be known; and doubtleſs would follow her
whom he loved: for I have heard that he has no relations in this country to ſtay him
in it, or invite him unto it more then any other place; for he is a man meerly of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and has nothing but what he gets by his induſtry, which he may do any where
elſe, as well as about the River <hi>Lignon:</hi> alſo, ſince you ſpeak of <hi>Sylvander</hi>'s humour,
I muſt tell you, that in this ſhort time I have known him, and obſerved his diſcourſe,
I find him to be a Shepherd of ſo free a Spirit, and of ſo pure and genuine wit, as I
cannot believe any ſuch abominable vice to be in him, as diſſimulation is; and indeed
inſtance me one action of all his life which argues him of that humour: I have heard
by a general report of all the Country, that he is a very Wiſe, and Virtuous Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd:
and is it probable that one ſingle man ſhould deceive ſo many eyes which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his actions? Aſſure your ſelf <hi>Diana</hi> that you are miſtaken in your judgement.
'Tis true Madam, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and interrupted, that perhaps I was: but now I am
not, and if one could foreſee the future, I never will be in my judgment of <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
unleſs my reſolution do change very much: <hi>Phillis</hi> who till then ſtood ſilent to
hear the reaſons of her companion, ſeeing now that ſhe replied not; ſhe began to
ſpeak; Siſter, (ſaid ſhe unto her, for ſo ſhe called her) I have no intereſt in the
buſineſs in queſtion, farther then in relation to you, and I aſſure my ſelf no more
has any here: and therefore you ought to receive what we ſay, not as coming from
perſons who are well wiſhers of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> but as from your good friends, who had
rather be deceived themſelves, then be any Inſtruments that others ſhould deceive
you. When you have this belief in us, as truly you ought to have, you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
think that when we ſpeak any thing of this Shepherd, it is not to divert you
from any good deſign you may have, nor to your prejudice to advantage <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
ſince he is meerly indifferent unto us; but on the contrary, you know we love
you, and would if it were poſſible deliver you from an opinion which doubtleſs, (ſet
as good a face upon it as you will) will bring you nothing but diſcontent: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Siſter, that every one is blind in their own caſe, and often, that which they moſt
would have, is worſt for them. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I never made the leaſt queſtion
or doubt of your affection to me, nor of that ſage <hi>Druids,</hi> ſince ſhe was pleaſed to
ſay that ſhe loved me, but muſt needs give credit unto the words of one whom I
think ſo juſt; I receive this favour which you are pleaſed to confer upon me, with
abundance of reſpect and thanks; aſſuring you, that both in this and every thing
elſe, I will always prefer your judgment before my own in all things: but I beſeech
you give me leave to tell you withall, that thoſe who are not concerned in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
farther then reſentment and compaſſion cauſeth, commonly they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
nor look into the matter ſo neerly, as thoſe who muſt bear all the burthen:
and to their advice and their counſels, although they do not proceed from any ill will,
but perhaps from much affection, yet may they be miſtaken and be deficient in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things; becauſe the judgment which they give, cannot be good and ſolid, unleſs
it be grounded upon moſt certain knowledg: and therefore we do commonly ſay,
that every one knows beſt where his ſhooe pinches him, or on which ſide the pain
is moſt troubleſome. But Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> things that are dubious, and cannot
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53527:184"/>
be well made out, me thinks ſhould be decided by plurality of voices: for my part,
this has been always my rule, that were I ſee all are of opinion that ſuch a thing is
of a green colour, which ſeems red unto me, I do infallibly believe, that my eye is
deceived, or elſe I ſhould think the thing to be of the ſame colour which all others
do: you have an opinion that <hi>Sylvander</hi> loves <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and we all ſay that there is
no ſuch thing, nor any probability of it; why therefore ſhould not you conform
your opinion unto ours? But Siſter, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> I am not alone; <hi>Laonice</hi> who
has ſeen the truth, does ſecond me; <hi>Laonice,</hi> ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> is ſubtile enough to ſay it,
with a deſign of putting you to abundance of pain and trouble. What profit, ſaid
<hi>Diana,</hi> will accrue unto her by that? The profit, replied <hi>Astrea,</hi> which ſuch reap
who are delighted in ſowing ſeditious, it is their paſtime and pleaſure; and hers may
be to ſee how you will carry it out, and perhaps to diſcover, whether it be true that
<hi>Sylvander</hi> does love you, or you him: good Siſter, do not give more credit unto
that ſubtile woman, then you do unto your deareſt friends: the judgment of all
thoſe who do know <hi>Sylvander,</hi> will be againſt you; the whole courſe of that Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
life has been ſuch, as his very enemies cannot lay the leaſt reproach to his
charge: Joyn all theſe together, and add thereunto the reaſons which we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
unto you, and afterwards ſee, whether it be likely, or have any ſhadow of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood,
that the ſingle teſtimony of <hi>Laonice</hi> can be true and credible. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
(ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>) I have talked with <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and he does ſo peremptorily deny all
that <hi>Laonice</hi> ſays, that if <hi>Laonice</hi> ſay truly, he is the moſt deteſtable Shepherd in the
world. Yet every one does know (added <hi>Alexis</hi>) that <hi>Sylvander</hi> is a man who
ſears the Gods, and is not ignorant of what is a ſin againſt them; if he be not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
then he knows how great a ſin perjury is: and if he do fear the Gods, he
would never commit it; and therefore I conclude that my judgment was good, when
at the firſt I affirmed that <hi>Sylvander</hi> does love you, and that he loves none elſe but
you. Madam, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and interrupted, not being able to endure the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this diſcourſe, neither <hi>Sylvander</hi> nor I, do deſerve you ſhould take ſo much
pains in talking of us, eſpecially upon a ſubject which concerns us ſo little: for as for
him, I believe all his demonſtrations of good will unto me, are only conſequents of
that wager which is betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and him: and as for me, I aſſure you that I did
never receive them but under the notion of that diſſimulation, ſo as the buſineſs is of
ſo ſmall a weight, and we are both ſo little intereſted in it, that it is not worth talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any further. Oh Madam, cryed out <hi>Phillis,</hi> I proteſt, ſhe diſſembles, and
ſpeaks very far from her thoughts; pardon me Siſter, ſaid ſhe and turned towards
<hi>Phillis,</hi> if I ſpeak the truth, for I cannot endure this diſſimulation. Nay, nay, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bluſh, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> nor lay your hand upon your face to cover it, leſt we ſhould
ſee: you know I ſpeak nothing but truth, and that you do really love <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
alſo that <hi>Sylvander</hi> loves you, I am ſure you are not ignorant of it: <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea,</hi>
began to laugh at the manner of <hi>Phillis</hi> in her expreſſions; and <hi>Diana</hi> her ſelf
could not forbear, although ſhe endeavoured to hide it; and therefore recollecting
her ſelf, ſhe anſwered thus; I muſt confeſs Siſter, that I did bluſh to hear you ſpeak
thus, eſpecially before this great <hi>Druide,</hi> what opinion do you think ſhe will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of me, who has not had the honour to be known unto her till of late? But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(ſaid ſhe, and turned towards <hi>Alexis</hi>) do not believe what this Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe
doth ſay; for all is but in jeſt, and ſhe her ſelf does not think as ſhe ſpeaks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> would have anſwered, and ſo would <hi>Phillis,</hi> but they were ſo near <hi>Aſtreas</hi>
houſe, that they were conſtrained to change diſcourſe, leſt <hi>Phocion</hi> ſhould hear,
whom they ſaw at the door, and who conducted them in, where ſupper was ready
upon the table.</p>
                     <p>During all the time of the repaſt, nothing was diſcourſed upon but the accident of
the day; a paſſage ſo unaccuſtomed in that Country, that <hi>Phocion</hi> ſaid, in all his
time he never heard of the like, unleſſe that of <hi>Philander,</hi> when a ſtranger offered
to wrong <hi>Diana.</hi> Alas, alas! (ſaid ſhe) that indeed was a day the moſt diſaſterous
that <hi>Lignon</hi> had ſeen of a long time; for ſince the death of him and <hi>Philidas,</hi> I am
ſure that my contentment has been but a little. I aſſure you, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> fortune

I loſt a Father and Mother, and am able to ſay and ſay truly, that my eyes were
never dry ſince, as oft as I remembred that fatal mis-fortune. And I, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi>
may ſay as much, and almoſt about the ſame time, at leaſt if reports make a true
calculation. But theſe ſad remembrances are the moſt cruel enemies we have; and
therefore for my part, knowing them to be ſo, I ſhun them as much as poſſibly I
can: Oh Miſtris, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> It is an eaſie matter for you to expel ſuch ſad remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
of things which grieve you, for you have a good Father who loves you, and
helps you out with ſupplies of comforts; but were you an orphan, deprived of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother as I am, I believe you would more deeply reſent the remembrance
of ſuch fatal loſſes: but however, I have moſt juſt reaſon to be thankful unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which after ſo great a loſs has not left me without ſome ſupport, in giving me a
ſecond Father, unto whom I am obliged in double bonds of gratitude; but for all
that, believe it Miſtris, it is a moſt ſad conſtraint that ſeparates a child from Father
and Mother. Upon this <hi>Phocion</hi> began to ſpeak; It is moſt certain children (ſaid
he) for ſo my age permits me to call you, that fortune has the ſame power in all
places alike; and that ſhe is pleaſed to make her power known as well in Villages, as
in great Monarchies. But it is true alſo, that as high and lofty Towers are more
expoſed to the tearing tempeſts and bluſtering winds, then the humble Cottages
wherein we live, ſo alſo we do more ſeldom ſee any of theſe bloody conſequences
of fortune amongſt us: they are much more frequent in great Empires, and proud
Republiques, which the more reſt and quiet they have, the fuller they are of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and inquietudes, and of greater turbulencies then our poor Villages are capable
of: ſo as what we eſteem a ſtorm, is with them a calm. This was the main reaſon
why thoſe from whom we are deſcended, did chuſe this kind of life, as the moſt
happy which mortals can make choiſe of. But for all that, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> I do
hear as many complaints and griefs amongſt you, as amongſt the greateſt Potents
upon earth. So children, anſwered <hi>Phocion,</hi> do uſe to cry for the loſſe of an apple,
as if it were the loſſe of a great Empire: For my part (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> and interrupted)
I do not think ſorrows are greater, for having the greater cauſes of them; but that
is leaſt which is leaſt reſented. Moſt true, replied <hi>Phocion,</hi> it is ſo in regard unto the
troubled ſoul, but not ſo, if it be reſented, and meaſured according to the right
rules of reaſon; for then every thing will be reſented and eſteemed as it is: and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
when the paſſion is ceaſed, we do laugh at that, at which we cryed before;
but all our diſcourſe (ſaid <hi>Phocion,</hi> ſeeing them ready to riſe from the Table) does
teach us this, that there is no place under the cope of Heaven which is entirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the blows of fortune, and that we ought alwayes to ſtand upon our
guards againſt them, that when they come to aſſault us, we may not only reſiſt
them, but alſo without taking the ſhadow for the ſubſtance, which is commonly the
greater, we may meaſure them according to reaſon, and not with any partial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments
of thoſe blows which we receive, nor with too many tears which ſeldom
do any good, but with prudence, reaſon, moderation and patience.</p>
                     <p>Upon this they aroſe from the Table; and after ſome other ſuch Diſcourſe, bed-time
being come, the <hi>Druide,</hi> and the three Shepherdeſſes, retired themſelves to
their chamber:</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Dorinde</hi> and her companions, with thoſe that conducted
them, went unto <hi>Marſelles,</hi> and endeavoured to beguil the length of the way, and
the perplexities of the ſad <hi>Dorinde,</hi> with various and pleaſant diſcourſe. But <hi>Hylas,</hi>
who led her by the arm, and was not much uſed to give way unto any melancholy
dumps, not being able to endure her ſilence (for when others talked, ſhe was mute)
I pray good long ſince Miſtris (ſaid he unto her) how long muſt this ſimple ſilence
laſt? My long ſince Servant (ſaid ſhe, and ſmiled) I beſeech you pardon me, for I
am in a very naughty humour, and cannot help it. Theſe dumpiſh humours (repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

ſuch and ſo many various actions has befallen me, that you cannot hear them but be
delighted: I will promiſe not to make you any ſadder then you are, and commonly
it is more delightful to hear the adventures of others, then to tell their own. No.
ſaid <hi>Thamires,</hi> and began to ſpeak, it is more expedient that this fair Stranger do
relate unto us the cauſe of her coming into this Country, then for <hi>Hylas</hi> to relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us his conſtant inconſtancies, which every one here does know. Oh good <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires</hi>
(ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) indeed you have great reaſon to twit me with my inconſtancies:
Pray tell me when ever any of them did ſo much hurt as your obſtinate humour cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
conſtancy has done? I do not blame you nor your humour (ſaid <hi>Thamires</hi>) nor
do I commend them, but leave it to the judgement of thoſe that will take the pains
to conſider them; I only ask you, wherein did my obſtinate humour called conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
do you any harm? It is not to me alone (replied <hi>Hylas</hi>) that it is obnoxious, but
unto all thoſe that are about the Banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and to all the whole Country of
Forreſts, all whom do reſent the injury you have done them, in ſpoyling the beauty
of this wiſe woman (pointing at <hi>Celidea</hi>) who was one of the greateſt ornaments of
the Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Shepherd (ſaid <hi>Celidea,</hi> and interrupted him) I do think my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
happy in that which you think a loſs; for by parting with a thing of a poor
trivial value, I have in exchange the greateſt tranquility of Spirit, and as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
of mind, as can poſſibly be deſired. We do not talk of the tranquility
of your mind, wiſe Shepherdeſs, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> nor of your contentments, but of that
happineſs which we have loſt by the obſtinacie of <hi>Thamires;</hi> and if ſuch a chance had
hapned unto <hi>Hylas,</hi> perhaps you ſhould become as fair as ever you was. Is not <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde</hi>
fairer then ſhe was when firſt I began to love her? Look upon <hi>Florice, Cerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,
Palinice;</hi> and did you ſee <hi>Cryſeide,</hi> you would ſay that all thoſe whom I love,
are hugely beholding to me; for I leave them all fairer then I found them: and not
like thoſe blaſters of Beauty (for ſo may all your <hi>Thamyreſes,</hi> your <hi>Tyrciſes,</hi> your
<hi>Sylvanders,</hi> and ſuch like be called) who never leave any one of thoſe they love, till
they have either made them ugly, or brought them to their graves, as two of you
have done, and you ſhall ſee what will become of <hi>Diana,</hi> before the wilful <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and ſhe part; you ſee ſhe is now young, and very fair; and I dare venture the
affection which I have unto <hi>Stella,</hi> that before he quit her, either he or ſhe are in
their graves; then what will become of thoſe fair eyes, and a hundred alluring fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
Well, well, God keep you from ſuch ſervants, as will never let thoſe they love
alone till they be dead; nay, even in their very graves they will be troubling them.
Pray ſee I beſeech you, if any that ever I ſerved were uſed ſo indiſcreetly: No, no,
when I leave them, I leave them in ſuch a condition, as others are contented to love
them after me. Do not think <hi>Hylas</hi> (anſwered <hi>Thamires</hi> ſoberly) that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
which we do ſo religiouſly obſerve, and which you do ſo much inveigh againſt,
is either an humour, or any obſtinacy, but only an earneſt deſire not to fail in thoſe
duties which we owe both unto our ſelves and unto thoſe we love; Unto our ſelves,
becauſe alteration of opinion is to condemn that which we once approved of, and
there is nothing more ſhameful, nor which ſhews more defects in a man then that;
For if it be underſtanding which prefers us before the reſt of animals, are not thoſe
who want this underſtanding no better then beaſts without reaſon? But of all vices,
Inconſtancy does moſt diſcover and argue that defect; then <hi>Hylas,</hi> you muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
confeſs, that none can commit a greater offence, then by ſhewing themſelves
wavering and inconſtant: For the Will which never conſents unto any thing but
what the Judgement tells him is good, chuſing another object, does undeniably ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
that his judgement was deceived either the firſt or the ſecond time: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though there were no other reaſon but our own particular reputation, we ought
never to conſent unto inconſtancy, which renders us moſt worthy of all ſcorn and
contempt. But further, it a moſt unpardonable offence againſt the perſon whom
we do love; For <hi>Hylas,</hi> does any change but when they think they change for the
better? And therefore is it not an injury unto her whom we loved, to leave her for
another, ſince we do as good as ſay that the laſt is the better? <hi>Hylas</hi> not being able
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53527:185"/>
to endure that <hi>Thamires</hi> ſhould go any further with this diſcourſe without interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
he went nearer him, and looked him in the face, and ſeeming deſirous to look
under his clothes, Shepherd (ſaid he unto him) let me ſee, if under the habit of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,
Sylvander</hi> be not diſguiſed, for me-thinks I hear him ſpeak in his tone. Ah
<hi>Hylas,</hi> anſwered <hi>Thamires,</hi> your having that opinion, is a ſigne you think my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be good; for there is nothing which comes from ſo excellent a wit, which
ought not to be eſteemed ſo. You are very much miſtaken good <hi>Thamires,</hi> replied
<hi>Hylas,</hi> for hearing your arguments ſo ſhallow and ill-grounded, I thought them to
be his, or he himſelf which uttered them, and not <hi>Thamires,</hi> who is held for a very
prudent and wiſe Shepherd; and to make good what I ſay, I will ſhew you how
falſe your reaſons are.</p>
                     <p>You affirm that one ought to continue in his obſtinacy of loving one that they
once loved, in two conſiderations: The one in reſpect of himſelf; and the other in
reſpect of her whom he loves. Ah <hi>Thamires!</hi> It is an eaſie matter to you who are
antiquated; for your clothes are not only made after the old mode, but your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are as old, and cut out according to the old Gauliſh garb: Good friend, is
there any thing in a man more deſpiſable then ſillineſs and indiſcretion? And is it not
the height of indiſcretion and ſillineſs, to know what is happineſs, and to court and
follow that which will make him miſerable? I beſeech you fair and diſcreet Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes
be judges, and tell me whether you would not think that husbandman a very
fool, that has divers times found by experience ſuch a piece of ground is not fit for
corn, and will ſtill continue ſowing it with the ſame ſeed, and only out of a fooliſh
fear, leſt it ſhould be ſaid that he had no judgement at the firſt. Ah my good friend
<hi>Thamires,</hi> is it any thing but gain and profit that gets reputation in theſe days? And
indeed, if one ſhould enquire of the quality and capacity of any one, be it either as
a ſervant, or any other ways, Did you ever hear the queſtion asked ſuch a one,
whether he be conſtant or inconſtant? No, no <hi>Thamires,</hi> but only whether he can
manage well his buſineſs, whether he be rich, whether he have good flocks, and
ſuch things as can encreaſe and keep them, not by an obſtinate reſolution never to
part with them, but by ſelling and changing them as oft as occaſion ſhall require.
Suppoſe friend, you were upon the Sea, you would quickly be ſhipwrack'd if you
kept your Sayl conſtant to one wind; no, no, wiſe men will turn their ſayl to all
winds. The very ſame it is in the affairs of the world, and it is ſoverain wiſdom to
change according to occaſions. And as to your aſſertion, that changing does of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
againſt the perſon whom one did love; good <hi>Thamires,</hi> what do you think of
me? Or, whom do you think I am? Is there not ſome perſons who make bread, and
others who eat it? Do not ſome make clothes, and others wear them? Why ſhould
I not give them the ſame counſel that I would take my ſelf? I mean, that as I change
them for others, ſo let them change me for whom they like better, when they have
a mind unto it: But in as much as I think it is impoſſible that thoſe whom I once lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſhould ever meet with a better, they muſt even content themſelves as well as
they can, and conſider, that of all things in the world, ſome are deſtined unto hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
and others unto miſery. Amongſt horſes, ſome are for the plow, and ſome
are for the ſaddle; amongſt dogs, ſome lie in Ladies laps, and others lick the drip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
pan in the kitchin; and ſo amongſt men, ſome to be ſerved, and others to
ſerve: 'Tis true, their fate is hard, but will they complain of <hi>Hylas</hi> for it? No, it
is not in me to command him who ordained them that cruel deſtiny; but if they
will be complaining, it muſt be for being born under ſuch an unlucky conſtellation:
and yet I muſt tell you, that this very offence which you preſuppoſe, is nothing but
imagination: For when a Muſician changes notes, does he change them becauſe he
thought thoſe he left to be worſe then thoſe he took? No, no Shepherd, but it was
to make his Muſique better, and more delightful, which otherwiſe would be dull
and tedious. If a Painter change colours, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay ſomtimes the very piece it ſelf, is it
becauſe he deſpiſed the firſt colour? No, but on the contrary, becauſe he would
more enliven it, and ſhadow the firſt colour ſo, that he ſets it off with greater luſter
then at the firſt: So <hi>Thamires,</hi> when we do leave a Shepherdeſs whom we did love,
and take another, it is not as you think, becauſe we eſteem her more then her we
left, but only to follow the rules and dictates of Nature, which reacheth us, that it
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53527:186"/>
is nothing but variety which renders the univerſe delightful. Look upon every thing,
even from the loweſt to the higheſt, and you will find, that nature has engraved
this inſtinct and this Law, in ſuch characters as cannot be defaced. Tell me <hi>Thami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
when you lye in your bed, do you never turn from one ſide to another? If
you do, you are inconſtant, and ſhews want of judgement, in chuſing the worſe
ſide at the firſt: when you walk, or dance; why do you change legs, but rather
hop upon the firſt you began with, if you will be punctual to your firſt beginnings?
When you ſpeak, why do you not make uſe ſtill of the ſame word? Why do Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
finger more ſtrings then one? And why do they vary into ſo many ſeveral tunes?
I ſee Shepherd that you laugh at what I ſay: but believe it, I have greater reaſon to
laugh at you, when you ſay, that one is inconſtant in loving ſeveral Shepherdeſſes, or
that one offends her whom he leaves.</p>
                     <p>I muſt needs confeſs, ſaid <hi>Thamires,</hi> that I do laugh at the arguments which you
uſe to maintain your fickle humour: I believe there is none in the company but does
the like, and perhaps <hi>Hylas</hi> himſelf alſo, if not in his face, yet in his heart: for it is
a very hard matter to forbear upon ſuch a ſubject: and I wiſh <hi>Sylvander</hi> were here
to anſwer (as it is neceſſary) unto your Sophiſtry: I am glad to hear, replied <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
that you call for help; it is a ſign you think your ſelf overcome: but never be
aſhamed of it, for though <hi>Sylvander</hi> himſelf were here, whom you accompt your
Oracle, yet I am confident he would confeſſe my victory, and himſelf ſubmit unto
it: Oh <hi>Hylas!</hi> (ſaid <hi>Thamires</hi>) you do miſtake the reaſon why I deſired <hi>Sylvanders</hi>
company; it is not becauſe I want any arguments to anſwer your aſſertions, for it is
an eaſie matter unto any that will take the pains: but it is becauſe that Shepherd is
able by his ſplendent fancies, and excellent eloquence, to give this fair company bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contentment, then is my dull genius: and yet in his abſence, ſince he who is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
unto truth, is culpable of a lye; I will briefly anſwer you, but it ſhall be upon a
condition, that you give me leave to laugh at what you have aſſerted: in the firſt
place, I confeſs <hi>Hylas,</hi> that Husbandman to be very indiſcreet; who having found
by tryal that his ground is not proper for one ſeed, will not ſow it with another, and
change his ſeed: but <hi>Hylas,</hi> this does not prove what you aſſert; for love ought
not to precede the knowledg of the party loved. The Husbandman had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
at the firſt of the quality of his Land, ſo as he ought not to change his ſeed till
he has found it by experience and knowledg; and therefore all thoſe conſequent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which you uſed, to change the ſail according to the wind, and that it is
prudence to know how to comply with occaſions, we do agree with you, that it is
indeed high wiſdom to be guided by, and according to the weather; and the reaſon
is, becauſe we cannot command the wind and the weather as we will: ſo that <hi>Hylas,</hi>
you muſt know, that in things which have dependency upon our ſelves, and which
are in our own power, it is a ſhame to change; but on the contrary, in thoſe things
which depend upon the power of another, it is high prudence to know how, and
when to turn and change according to occaſion. Now Love, which does depend
upon the will, there is no queſtion, but it is in our power, ſince God did never give
us any thing which is more abſolutely ours, then this will; which has no matter of
chance or fortune in it, as there is in the Sea, or in the Winds. But truly your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Muſitians in changing Notes, and Painters in colours, is a very ſubtile ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
indeed: but good <hi>Hylas,</hi> do you not know, that their firſt deſigns are to
arrive at the end of their works? The Muſitian he deſigns to make good Muſique,
and the Painter to illuſtrate his work; and by changing Notes, and uſing ſeveral
colours, they both arrive at their firſt deſigned end: moſt right (ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and
interrupted) and even ſo I doe never change, but with a deſign to arrive at the end
of my deſires. But, replied <hi>Thamires,</hi> Love will not allow of that, whoſe perfection
does ſo much conſiſt in unity, as it can never be perfect until it attain unto that one
which it aymes at: and hence it is that our <hi>Druids</hi> ſay, two perſons that do love,
become one and the ſame; which is eaſily comprehended, ſince both parties have
one and the ſame will, and ſo conſequently are one and the ſame perſon. As for
your arguments of inconſtancy drawn from turning my ſelf in my bed, inferring it to
proceed from want of judgement in not chuſing the beſt ſide at the firſt; you muſt
know <hi>Hylas,</hi> that the body, which is heavy and ſubject to wearineſſe, by its own
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53527:186"/>
weight, muſt eaſe it ſelf by turning, that both ſides may bear the weight alike: but
the ſoul, which is all ſpirit, is not ſubject unto ſuch inconveniences, and therefore
ought not to change: but good <hi>Hylas,</hi> give me leave to laugh a little before I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
your argument of walking and ſpeaking; ſaying, that thoſe who walk, if they
will be conſtant, muſt never go but upon one leg, and hop; or when they ſpeak, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
uſe but one word: I believe <hi>Hylas,</hi> if nature had called you to councel, when ſhe
appointed to every thing their motions, perhaps you had invented ſome other way
for men to walk, and had made hopping ſerve the turn; but ſince you were not,
you cannot call them inconſtant, who walk as nature ordained them, ſince they can
do no otherwiſe: and as for matter of ſpeaking, know <hi>Hylas,</hi> that ſpeaking was
given unto men, to make thoſe who hear them, underſtand the ſecret conceptions
of their ſouls: now do but invent one word, that can make to be underſtood all
that the mind conceives; and then I will ſay, we were inconſtant if we uſed any
words but that alone: do you ſee therefore how ſhallow all your reaſons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are? Certainly you muſt needs confeſſe, that they are grounded upon ſand,
which is as looſe, and fleeting, as your inconſtant humour is. But are you not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
pleaſant, in ſaying, that thoſe whom you quit for others, ought not to
lay the blame upon you, but upon their conſtellation and their deſtiny? It is moſt
true indeed, that they have reaſon to complain againſt their malignant influence, for
I think it a very great miſ-fortune unto them that are troubled with your addreſſes;
but are not you extreamly to blame in being the inſtrument of this malignant influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Tell me, I beſeech you, is not the gallows upon which a malefactor is han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
a horror unto every one, and ſcorned? Ah my friend, what are you unto thoſe
poor women that are deſtined unto your inconſtancies, but the gallows where they
receive their puniſhments?</p>
                     <p>At this all the company laughed a long while, and <hi>Hylas</hi> alſo, though it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
himſelf; and when he began to reply, he was prevented by <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> who
having met with <hi>Doris,</hi> did ſo hang upon her, that ſhe could not be rid of him;
at the firſt he ran unto her, and kneeled before her; he would have kiſſed her feet,
and with all humble reverence touched the hem of her garment: but ſeeing ſhe went
ſtill on, he would not go out of thoſe limits, unto which he was by a kind of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
confined; he was ſo bold as to ſtay her by her gown, and would have taken
her by her arm, which cauſed her to cry out: and <hi>Palemon</hi> being not far off, ran in
to help her; but do what <hi>Palemon</hi> could, <hi>Adraſtes</hi> would not let his hold go: when
he pulled one hand off, <hi>Adraſtes</hi> took hold with the other: and <hi>Adraſtes</hi> being a
big ſtrong man, <hi>Palemon</hi> would hardly have maſtered him, but for the coming of
this company, who advancing towards them, the Shepherds took hold of <hi>Adraſtes,</hi>
and gave <hi>Doris</hi> time to eſcape out of his hands. The ſtate and miſerable condition of
this poor Shepherd, moved <hi>Dorinde</hi> to pity him: and the beauty of <hi>Doris</hi>
made her very deſirous to know how the diſſention did ariſe: <hi>Palemon</hi> as a very
civil and courteous Shepherd, ſaid unto her, be pleaſed to know, fair ſtranger (for
ſo he thought her by her habit) that this Shepherd and I were both in love with this
Shepherdeſs, &amp; ſhe being adjudged unto me, he received the ſentence ſo ſadly, that he
fell mad, and loſt the uſe of reaſon. A thouſand pities, ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> for he ſeems
to be a Shepherd of excellent qualities: were he in the Town where I was born, I
believe, there might be found a remedy for him; for I have ſeen one cured of the
ſame diſeaſe; and ſo may he, eſpecially if it be not long ſince the miſ-fortune did
befal him. It was not above two months ſince (ſaid <hi>Palemon</hi>) and I am ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
ſorry for him, that I would do any thing which might be conducing to his
cure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doubtleſs (ſaid <hi>Dorinde</hi>) this will; I have had the experience of it, and
the remedy is very eaſie, is there not a Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in this Country? And
is there not another near unto it, dedicated unto the Goddeſſe <hi>Minerva?</hi> There is
many of them, anſwered <hi>Thamires,</hi> which they ſay, the Romans built; but, as for
us, we do never frequent them; becauſe our <hi>Druids</hi> teach us, that the Majeſty of
the Great <hi>Tautates</hi> is ſo incomprehenſible, that the whole Univerſe is only a Temple
worthy of his grandeur, which he himſelf did build; for ſuch as are built by the
impotent hands of men, are too mean for ſuch a Divinity: and this is the reaſon
why all our Sacrifices are offered in Sacred Groves, and under no other roof, but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53527:187"/>
the glorious Arch of Heaven. But that people whom I mentioned, had Sacrificers
which ſerved in Temples, and I think that I have ſeen ſuch a one in the great City
of <hi>Marſelles:</hi> for the Founder did not only give it his own name, but alſo planted
his Religion there, and I remember very well, there is alſo another dedicated unto
<hi>Minerva,</hi> which as I think joyns unto that of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> If ſo, ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and
that you deſire the cure of this poor Shepherd, carry him thither, and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his cure: for there needs no more then to drive a nail which hath touched
his Pemples into the wall of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Temple, which is on that ſide towards the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Minerva.</hi> If that be all (ſaid <hi>Palemon</hi>) I ſwear that to morrow I will neither
eat nor drink until I have driven one ſo far, as it ſhall hardly be pulled out, but by
breaking the wall. It is not you, replied <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that ought to do that ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but it muſt be the principal perſon of the place. If ſo, (ſaid <hi>Palemon</hi>) I will
fall upon my knees before <hi>Amaſis,</hi> I will beſeech her to do that charitable Act, and
I will make a vow, that if this poor Shepherd recover, I will not deny the firſt thing
that ſhall be asked of me, be it made by whom it will. And becauſe <hi>Adraſtes</hi> ſtill
followed the company, and the place which he uſed to haunt very near, <hi>Palemon</hi>
entreated <hi>Doris,</hi> that ſhe would either by prayers, or any other way, to make him
follow them unto <hi>Marſelles,</hi> whither he underſtood all this good company was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Doris,</hi> to pleaſe him, though much againſt the grain of her mind, went to that
poor Shepherd when ſhe ſaw him ready to leave them. <hi>Adraſtes</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto
him) will you not go with me unto my houſe? He went nearer to her, and after
he had looked well upon her, he anſwered, to my houſe do you ſay, <hi>Adraſtes</hi> and
<hi>Doris?</hi> Yes, replied <hi>Doris,</hi> will not <hi>Adraſtes</hi> go with <hi>Doris?</hi> To which he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not a word but <hi>Doris:</hi> and turning himſelf about, offered to go away. <hi>Doris</hi>
then calling him by his name, and he turning towards her, ſhe offered her hand and
ſaid unto him; come, come, <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> do not you love <hi>Doris?</hi> He looked ſeriouſly
upon her, and ſaid not a word; and it would have pitied any one, to ſee how
tears trickled from his eyes, though he ſmiled. <hi>Doris</hi> then made him a ſecond offer
of her hand; what <hi>Adraſtes</hi> (ſaid ſhe) do you not know <hi>Doris?</hi> Then he anſwered,
<hi>Doris;</hi> yes, ſaid ſhe, I am <hi>Doris,</hi> who entreats <hi>Adraſtes</hi> to go with her unto <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles.</hi>
Then going to her, and taking her under the arm, he ſaid, <hi>Marſelles, Doris,
Adraſtes, Palemon,</hi> and never left ſaying ſo all the way long: but ſometimes did
weep, and ſometimes at the very ſame inſtant laugh, and would never anſwer unto
any queſtion, but only the laſt word of it.</p>
                     <p>They had already paſſed over the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> and left the houſe of <hi>Adamas</hi> on
the right hand, when they began to diſcover <hi>Marſelles;</hi> and becauſe <hi>Hylas</hi> was
very ſorry that he could not know the cauſe of <hi>Dorindes</hi> coming into Forreſts; it is
a hard caſe (ſaid he) that ſome fooliſh accident or other does always prevent me
in my deſires; what fooliſh accident do you complain of, ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> which has
prevented you in your deſires? Two things, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> I do complain of,
and they are very different; the one is, that <hi>Thamires</hi> and I have talked ſo long: &amp; the
other is, that <hi>Adrastes</hi> hath made us loſe that time which I deſired ſhould be ſpent in
hearing what has hapned unto you ſince laſt I ſaw you. If that be al, anſwered <hi>Dorin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
to content you, we ſhal remedy it when you pleaſe: theſe promiſes are eaſily made,
ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but often fail in performance; hold me for a perſon very uncivil, ſaid <hi>Dorin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
if I do not give you ſatisfaction in a thing which I may with ſo much eaſe perform;
I believe you to be civil enough, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> but I cannot tell whether your leiſure
and your will can permit it: as for matter of will, anſwered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> it ſhall not ſtick
upon that; and as for leiſure, I believe, that at night when we have nothing elſe to
do, we may have as good an opportunity as can be deſired. But pray, why have
you not as great a deſire to know the adventures of <hi>Florice,</hi> of <hi>Palinice,</hi> and <hi>Cerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi>
as well as mine? Is it becauſe you already know them? There is a hidden miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in that, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> and the truth is, I do not know them; but I do very
much wonder, now I think on it, that I ſhould never have that deſire; then turning
towards them, but good (in the dayes of old) Miſtriſſes, tell me, why you did not pay
that tribute which was due unto my curioſity and deſire? We do anſwer, ſaid <hi>Florice,</hi>
that neither you nor we had any will thereunto; but yet there is a reaſon which is
better, and which proceeds from a cauſe more high; for Heaven did forbid us:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53527:187"/>
How, how? ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> have you ſuch familiar converſation with Heaven? I do
not wonder now I ſhould ſo retire my ſelf from you, ſince you are ſo celeſtial: you
muſt not now be loved, but adored as heavenly beauties. <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cercinea,</hi> you
now ſpeak like unto your ſelf, who being one of thoſe <hi>Gallo-Ligurians,</hi> which retain
nothing of the ancient <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Religion, but the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ry name, having received the
<hi>Graecian</hi> fables for truths: but we, who adore nothing but one only <hi>Tautates,</hi> we
do not deſire to be adored. Oh <hi>Cercinea</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) I perceive your celeſtial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with Heaven; and your intimate familiarity with Angels, has made you
ſo divine, that now there is no coming near you: you do not talk now like <hi>Cercinea,</hi>
but like a Sarronide, an Eubages, a Propheteſs, a celeſtial <hi>Druide.</hi> God keep me
from loving you, ſince you are learned; for when I begin to talk unto you of my
affection, in lieu of anſwering, you will reprove me for not ſpeaking well: and God
knows how extreamly aſhamed ſhould I be to receive correction at this age. Then
turning towards <hi>Florice,</hi> but pray tell me in good earneſt (ſaid he) how comes it to
paſſe I ſhould never know the cauſe of your coming into this Country? Becauſe (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Florice</hi>) we would not tell it unto any, being ſo enjoyned by the Oracle,
which did forbid us to ſpeak of it, until a thing come to paſs which is not yet hapned.
Now I do ſee (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that heaven is better to me then I deſerve, ſince I am not
afflicted with any deſires of a thing that would have been long before the effect
would be obtained. But, ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> why might not I have ſatisfied this deſire,
for I do know all their adventures, almoſt as well as themſelves, and heaven has not
forbidden me to tell them? Were we not ſo neer the place unto which we go, ſaid
<hi>Lycidas,</hi> I ſhould humbly entreat that you would be pleaſed to take ſo much pains;
for I believe there is not a ſtranger upon the Banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> who hath ſo long
concealed the cauſe of their journey, as theſe three fair ones have: It ſeems ſaid
<hi>Hylas,</hi> that they have extreamly offended the Gods. Why? ſaid <hi>Cercinea.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(anſwered <hi>Hylas</hi>) the greateſt puniſhment that heaven can lay upon a woman, is
to be ſilent. If it be ſo (anſwered ſhe) heaven has been very favourable to us, in
giving us occaſion to ſhew our ſelves more then women.</p>
                     <p>Such diſcourſe as this beguiled the length of the way; and when they were come
to the gates of <hi>Marſelles, Periander, Merindor,</hi> and their companions asked <hi>Dorinde</hi>
if ſhe intended to do her obeyſance unto <hi>Amaſis</hi> that ſame night; and where ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to lodge if ſhe did not. To whom <hi>Dorinde</hi> anſwered, that it was very late,
and that all the company was too weary to go ſo high as the Caſtle, which ſtood upon
the top of a ſteep hill; but yet ſhe knew not where to lodge elſe-where, having
no acquaintance in the place: <hi>Lycidas</hi> upon this be-thinking himſelf; I beſeech you
(ſaid he) give me leave to go before you into the Town, and if he whom I hope to
find in it be there, I am confident your reception will not be bad. <hi>Dorinde</hi> thanked
him; and ſitting down under a ſhade neer the High-way, ſhe told him, that ſhe and
the company would expect his return in that place. Upon this <hi>Lycidas</hi> with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Corilas,</hi> went into the Town, and went as faſt as they could unto the houſe
of <hi>Clindor,</hi> the dear friend of <hi>Alcippes,</hi> the father of <hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>Lycidas,</hi> This
<hi>Clindor</hi> has ſtill in memory the affection which he bore unto their father, and ſince
the death of <hi>Alcippes</hi> and <hi>Celadon,</hi> all his good will was placed upon <hi>Lycidas,</hi> as all
that was left unto him of his dear friend; and therefore as ſoon as ever he ſaw him,
he held out his arms of love to embrace him, and ſhewed as much entire affection, as
if he had been his own ſon. Father, ſaid <hi>Lycidas</hi> unto him, for ſo he called him;
if I have been backward in rendring that duty which I owe unto you, I beſeech you
lay the blame upon the rural woods, which will hardly permit their inhabitants to
frequent great Cities, without offence unto the Laws of their ſolitary lives. Son,
ſaid <hi>Clindor,</hi> I do both excuſe and envie you: I excuſe you, becauſe <hi>Alcippes</hi> did all
his life moſt religiouſly obſerve the vow of his anceſtors: and I do envie the happy
lives you lead, when I conſider the turbulency and inquietude of ours: But Son,
continued he, and embraced him, you are very heartily welcome, and your companion
alſo; aſſuring your ſelf, that I cannot receive any greater contentment, then to ſee
the ſon of my dear friend <hi>Alcippes</hi> well and with me. This aſſurance Sir, ſaid <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas,</hi>
made me ſo bold as to offer your houſe to a great number of my friends who
accompanied me hither, though I did not know whether it would be thought too
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53527:188"/>
great a trouble: Son, ſaid <hi>Clindor</hi> with a ſmiling countenance, thoſe who do come
unto my houſe, eſpecially under ſo good a conductor as <hi>Lycidas,</hi> ſhall have as much
power in it as my ſelf; the trouble that will be, will be only unto them, but much
honour and contentment unto me: and then hearing who thoſe were whom he
brought with him; I am very ſorry ſaid he, that I had no ſooner notice: but ſince
they have ſurprized me, I hope t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>y will excuſe the inconveniences of my houſe, and
the they are moſt heartily welcome: Then calling for his ſon, <hi>Leontidas</hi> (ſaid he,
for that was his name) go along with your brother, offer this houſe unto thoſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to whom he will conduct you, and tell them, that if my age would permit me,
I would have waited upon them my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Lycidas</hi> with <hi>Leontidas</hi> went unto the company which expected him, who
after many complements of civility, <hi>Leontidas</hi> took <hi>Dorinde</hi> by one arm, and <hi>Hylas</hi>
took her by the other; when they came to the gates, the guards asked them who
they were, and from whence they came? The three Cavaliers told them their names,
and ſatisfied their demands; and <hi>Leontidas</hi> added, that they were going to the houſe
of <hi>Clindor.</hi> The guards then cryed them mercy, and asked pardon for their ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
becauſe it was but according to their duty and commands received from their
ſuperiour Officers. Thus they entred, and were conducted unto the houſe of <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
who received them with ſo kind a countenance, and treated them ſo nobly, as
every one admired he ſhould have ſet his houſe in ſuch excellent order as they
found it.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the ſad <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who after he had left <hi>Dorinde</hi> and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
was retired into the thickeſt woods, where he could leaſt be ſeen, and there
paſt away the reſt of the day with his own melancholy and mortal thoughts, till at
night he came to the place where <hi>Diana, Alexis, Aſtrea,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> found him reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
He did ſo avoid the ſight of every one, that he knew not what had hapned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Dorinde;</hi> for as ſoon as he ſaw any, he ſhunned them like a ſavage perſon. His
ſad melancholy retained him in this place until it was night; but when he ſaw the
canopy of heaven ſpangled with gliſtering ſtars, and thought that none was abroad,
he went out; not with any deſigne of diverting himſelf, but only to reſent his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
more apprehenſively, and that his ſorrows might the ſooner do that which his
hand durſt not againſt his life, leſt heaven ſhould be offended if he gave himſelf a
violent death.</p>
                     <p>This thought did inſenſibly conduct him unto the place where <hi>Phillis</hi> delivered the
cruel meſſage from <hi>Diana</hi> unto him: Oh moſt fatal place (ſaid he) and moſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for the higheſt piece of injuſtice that ever was committed upon the Banks of
<hi>Lignon:</hi> Oh thou moſt abominable and and odious piece of ground! I do wonder
Heaven does not cauſe the earth to open, and ſwallow thee in her deep Abyſs, and
never ſuffer thee to be ſooting for any innocent Shepherd to tread upon again.</p>
                     <p>Then folding his arms one within another, he continued; But if heaven will needs
purſue me with a perpetual hatred, as it hath done ever ſince that curſed day on
which I was born, why does it not execute and compleat its cruel deſtinies upon me?
Should I wiſh all places where I have reſented the unjuſt malignity of its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be Abyſſes; Alas, then all places where-ever I did ſet my foot, muſt be
ſwallowed up into the profundity of the earth. Then coming to the place where
he fell into a ſwoon, he ſtopped ſhort, and looked long ſilently upon it; at laſt he
began again, 'Twas here (ſaid he) where my diſaſterous cogitations did muſter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to overwhelm me; but how comes it to paſs I did endure them and not die?
And is not heaven aſhamed to ſee it ſelf ſurmounted by the conſtancy of a mortal?
It is not more ſtrange, to ſee how obſtinate the Deſtinies are in rendring me miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then it is to ſee the inſenſibility of my ſoul, in ſupporting their blows. But upon
good conſideration I needs muſt ſay, that heaven will either try what power it has in
tormenting, or what courage I have in ſuffering. But faireſt <hi>Diana,</hi> muſt you needs
be the inſtrument of ſo many cruelties? Can your beauty ever conſent unto the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of him that adores you? What excuſe can you alledge for your ſelf? You are
either the partner in this fault, or at leaſt the cauſe and the original; for it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
I ſhould love any but <hi>Diana,</hi> as it is for <hi>Diana</hi> to live, and not be the faireſt
in the whole world; and as long as I live, the moſt loved Shepherdeſs upon earth.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53527:188"/>
But alas, alas, you look for no excuſe where you cannot repent of the fault: or to
ſay better, where repentance would be a thouſand times greater ſatisfaction, then
the wrong.</p>
                     <p>Then ſtanding a while ſilent, and the moon ſhining very clear, he went looking
and ſtaring upon every thing about him, like a man that was diſtracted, and hardly
knew what it was that he did look upon: at laſt, the cruel diſcourſe of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and the
opinion which <hi>Diana</hi> had of his change, coming into his mind, he could not chuſe
but cry out: Oh God! Oh Heavens! Is it poſſible that the judgment of <hi>Diana,</hi>
which is ſo sound and quick in all other things, ſhould to my miſery, be thus miſtaken?
Can ſhe think <hi>Madonthe</hi> has any power to divert me from her, and her ſervice?
Could that Wiſe, Prudent, and Solid Shepherdeſs believe, that thoſe eyes which have
her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can look upon any other eyes but hers? Have I; Oh Faireſt Shepherdeſs, by
any of my actions, given any teſtimony that I become a <hi>Hylas</hi> or an <hi>Adraſtes?</hi> For
before I commit ſuch a ſin, I muſt needs be either one, or both; and I could not be
ſo inconſtant unleſs I were a fool, or a mad man.</p>
                     <p>This thought entertained him a long time, and would not let him depart from that
place, he thought to have found that contentment which he had loft: but on the
contrary, he met ſtill with freſh cauſes of grief; for wandering inſenſibly from one
thought to another, he began to think upon the ſweet beginnings of his affection,
and with what diſcretion <hi>Diana</hi> received the firſt buds of his love, under the notion
of a wager; with what kindneſs ſhe ſuffered that plant to take root, and how pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
ſhe ſaw it grow up to that grandeur which now is arrived at. And as conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants
of this thought, he ſet before his eyes the pleaſant jars of <hi>Phillis,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
anſwers of his Shepherdeſs; and briefly, all thoſe reaſons which he had to
hope, that his affection would thrive, and grow fruitfull. Then did he bethink
himſelf of that Bracelet of hair, which was intended for <hi>Phillis,</hi> and which he had
obtained of <hi>Diana,</hi> as an extraordinary favour. He guided his hand to the place
where he was wont to wear it, thinking to have the contentment of a kiſs from it:
but not finding it, he looked upon the other arm: but not finding it on either, he
was ſurprized with ſo much grief, as not being able to endure the blow of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter,
he fell to the ground, and ſo lay a long time without either motion or ſpeech;
but at laſt he revived, and concluded that now all hope was gone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sylvander</hi> had no ſooner ceaſed his complaints, but (as he thought) he heard
ſome coming towards him; and to know who they were, and alſo out of fear to be
ſeen, leſt by that means he ſhould be interrupted in his ſolitary thoughts, he kept
ſtill cloſe, and ſilent; then did he plainly hear ſome coming and talking very loud,
but not ſo as he could underſtand them at that diſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſtill keeping ſilence,
and they drawing neerer, he perceived by the help of the Moon, that they were
two men talking together: and when they were cloſe by the place where <hi>Sylvander</hi>
ſtood, they ſtopt a little; then did he hear one of them begin to ſing, and the effect
of his ſong was, <hi>That he had more love, then ſhe had cruelty.</hi> He had no ſooner done,
but the other began; and the ſubſtance of his ſong was, <hi>That he ought to love her for
no other end but to love her.</hi> Ah Brother, (ſaid the firſt, and interrupted the other)
you are in the right; for whoſoever does love for any other end but loving only, he
does abuſe the name of love, and moſt unworthily pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ane that pure and Sacred
Divinity. But give me leave to tell you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in what you alledged before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the torments which you and I do ſuffer, you have as little reaſon, as I have
much, to ſay, that there is no torment in the world that is equal unto mine. Brother,
(anſwered the other with a deep ſigh) that love which every one doth bear unto
himſelf, is the cauſe of that judgment: for when you ſee me ſuffer any pain, do
you not reſent it more then any ſtranger would? Doubtleſs I do (anſwered the firſt)
Then <hi>Alcander,</hi> replied the other, the ſame reaſon which makes you reſent my pain
more then another, does make you reſent your own more then mine: for as it is
natural to love a brother more then a ſtranger, ſo it is as natural to love ones ſelf
more then any elſe: it is love which gives the weight unto all things which fall under
opinion. I do not know <hi>Amilcar</hi> (ſaid he) how you intend this? It is true that
I am partly in the ſame belief, and partly not; I mean, that it is love which doth
cauſe reſentment of ſorrows and joyes, and that it is by it, and its ell, we do mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53527:189"/>
the greatneſs or the littleneſs of all things: but that every one does love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more then ſome others: Indeed brother, I muſt confeſs, that if this be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of nature, then nature has failed in me: for I do proteſt and vow, that I do
love <hi>Circinca,</hi> a thouſand times better then I do my ſelf; and it is an eaſie matter to
make this evident, ſince I do find in my ſelf towards her, all the effects which a
moſt extream love can produce: for firſt, I had rather any evil ſhould fall upon my
ſelf, then the leaſt upon her: and I deſire her contentment infinitely above my own;
there is nothing, be it never ſo full of difficulty, but I would attempt it, if there was
any hopes it would conduce thereunto: If any thing that pleaſed me, diſpleaſed her,
believe it, <hi>Amilcar,</hi> I had rather dye then receive it: and if theſe be not infallible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
that I do love another better then my ſelf, I know not what are. Brother,
replied <hi>Amilcar,</hi> I do reſent the very ſame effects of affection unto <hi>Palinice,</hi> which
you do unto <hi>Circinea:</hi> but oh <hi>Alcander,</hi> you are much miſtaken if you do conclude
thereby, that you do love <hi>Circinea</hi> better then your ſelf, or that I do love <hi>Palinice,</hi>
more then I do my ſelf. For if we will but ingeniouſly confeſs, it is the love of our
ſelves that makes us love them: and as the miſer does expoſe his life for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Gold which he loves; ſo do we Sacrifice our ſelves to the pleaſure of
thoſe fair ones whom we adore: Fie, fie Brother, replied <hi>Alcander,</hi> will you offer
ſuch a wrong unto our loves, as to compare them unto a miſers love of Gold? Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
your ſelf brother (ſaid <hi>Amilcar</hi> ſoberly) there is no difference betwixt them,
only the love that we do give unto theſe fair ones, is for a thing of greater value and
merit, and therefore it is more noble and reaſonable: but the very truth is, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of all loves, is ſelf love: does not the miſers care to preſerve his dearly beloved
Gold, proceed from the love of himſelf, and not his Gold? Doubtleſs it does; for
what cares the gold into whoſe hands it fals, ſince whereſoever it is, it is ſtill Gold
as well as in his hands. Then let us apply this reaſon unto our ſelves, and you will
find that it is the love which you hear unto your ſelf, which makes you have all thoſe
cares of <hi>Circinea,</hi> and all thoſe earneſt deſires of her contentment: would you wiſh
her ſo much happineſſe, and endeavour to procure it unto her, upon condition ſhe
ſhould extreamly love <hi>Clorian,</hi> and devote her ſelf wholly unto him, without ever
caring for you? But did ſhe love <hi>Clorian,</hi> replied <hi>Alcander,</hi> ſhe would not be ſo
happy as you ſuppoſe her. But ſuppoſe ſhe ſhould be as happy (ſaid <hi>Amiliar</hi>)
would you wiſh her the enjoyment of all thoſe contentments with <hi>Clorian?</hi> I ſee
you will not anſwer, nor have you any reaſon; but I will anſwer for you: it is moſt
certain, that you and I had rather ſee the grim face of death, then to ſee your <hi>Circi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi>
happy with <hi>Clorian;</hi> and I to ſee my <hi>Palinice,</hi> the happy wife of <hi>Sileines:</hi> and
therefore let us both ingeniouſly confeſſe, that all the happineſſe which we do wiſh
unto them, is but like the love of a Miſer to his Gold; that is, for our own
particular intereſt: though the exceſſe of our paſſions makes us think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, theſe ſtrangers continued on their walk, and for a while were ſilent.
<hi>Sylvander</hi> who heard them, and thought them to be perſons of merit and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
had a good mind to be talking with them, had it not been for the ſcurvy
humour, into which the jealouſie of <hi>Diana</hi> had put him: but conſidering this vexing
humour, he thought it better to be as he was, then interrupt them: and therefore,
he deſigned to go away: but as he was going, he ſaw theſe ſtrangers turn back, as
men that knew not which way to go; but having found that walk, would paſſe away
the reſt of the night in it. His fears to be ſeen, cauſed him to keep cloſe till they
were paſt, and afterwards to fall into the thick of the Wood. But whether he made
ſome noiſe, as he couched down, or whether the Moon ſhined clearer then it did
when they paſſed by before, I know not: but <hi>Alcander</hi> ſpied him, and ſhewed him
to his brother, who ſtepping nearer, certainly (ſaid he) it is a Shepherd who is a
ſleep. <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who ſeeing himſelf diſcovered, and who thought that they would
not go away before they made him ſpeak; he thought alſo that it was better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them: and therefore, he anſwered, if I do ſleep, then it may be ſaid, that a
man may ſleep and not reſt; for the miſerable condition wherein I am, will not
let me enjoy any: do not think <hi>Amilcar</hi> (continued he, and roſe up) that it is any
love which I bear unto my ſelf, makes me judge my miſery unequalled; for ſhould
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53527:189"/>
I judge by paſſion upon that which relates unto me, it would be rather by hatred
then love, ſince I am able to ſay, and ſay truly, that I never wiſhed any ſo much
harm as I do unto my ſelf. And though the miſery which I endure, be as much as
any mortal man can endure, yet am I ſo much my own enemy, that my hatred can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſatisfied, unleſs by wiſhing my miſeries multiplied above the number of all the
leaves in this Wood. I muſt confeſs, ſaid <hi>Amilcar,</hi> that if your condition be as bad
as you ſpeak it, all ſorrows muſt ſubmit unto yours. Oh <hi>Amilcar,</hi> ſaid <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
it is but too true, and did you but know my wounds, you would confeſs it alſo; but
becauſe it would be ſome kind of comfort to tell it, I will not give my ſelf ſo much
contentment. It ſeems (ſaid <hi>Alcander</hi>) that the greatneſs of your miſery hath dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you into deſpair, and you know deſpair argues but little knowledge, and little
courage: I muſt confeſs, ſaid the Shepherd, that my miſery is changed into deſpair,
but I do deny that deſpair, is alwaies from want of knowledge or courage; for were
it not a ſtrange ignorance to have ſuch extream misfortunes as I have, and not to
know them? And would it not argue a great defect of courage, and reſentment, to
ſtand in ſuch fear of death, as to wiſh, living in ſuch miſery? This may paſs amongſt
petty and trivial miſchances and miſeries, ſuch as are common and ordinary; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſuch as are grown to that height, as there is no remedy, nor no cure, it is a
folly, a madneſs, an argument of a poor low courage, to endure the ſhame which
cannot be avoided by any way but by being no more, However replied <hi>Alcander,</hi>
it is an argument of a faint and poor courage, to want a heart that will endure the
blows of an enemy. Moſt true, replied the Shepherd, but there is no reaſon to
hope for a thing which there is no hopes to obtain, and thereupon I ſay it is, that my
miſery is deſperate; not that I do conclude thereby, that I will run a ſword into my
breaſt to kill my ſelf, or throw my ſelf head long down a precipice: ſuch an act would
argue a defect in courage; nay worſe, it is a great impiety and ſin committed againſt
the great <hi>Tautates;</hi> for man being the workmanſhip of his hands, it were a moſt
horrid ſin to deſtroy what he hath made; He, as the Potter with his pot, may do
what he will with us: and we were made to be as he will have us, and not to diſpoſe
of our ſelves according to our own will; if it be his pleaſure we ſhould endure pain
and abundance of miſery, we muſt endure, and not endeavour to croſs his will by
any ſudden death: but I begin to reſent ſome mittigation of my ſadneſs by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
which I have had, and therefore, becauſe I will not do my miſeries ſo much
wrong, I do conjure you <hi>Amilcar,</hi> by your love unto <hi>Palinice,</hi> and you <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
by yours unto <hi>Circinea,</hi> that you let me go and retire my ſelf into the moſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
parts of this wood; and in requital I will tell you (that if you ſeek for thoſe
two fair Shepherdeſſes) where you may find them; and that is, where I have often
ſeen them upon the banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> in the company of the fair <hi>Diana, Astrea,</hi> and
their companions: upon this, he ſaluted them, and went into the Wood as faſt as he
could, leſt he ſhould be followed by theſe ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>They on the other ſide raviſhed to hear ſuch diſcourſe come from a Shepherd,
they were ſo aſtoniſhed, as they could not ſtir a foot after him; But having held their
eyes a while upon the place where he entred into the Wood; <hi>Alcander</hi> broke ſilence
firſt: Brother, ſaid he, did you ever hear ſuch a ſhepherd? His habit indeed, ſaid <hi>Amilcar</hi>
does ſpeak him Shepherd, but not his tongue: for my part ſaid <hi>Alcander,</hi> I think him to
be the good Genius of <hi>Lignon</hi> who preſented himſelf unto us in that habit, to ſhew us,
that there are ſome who are in greater miſery then we are. Perhaps, replied <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi>
I ſhould have been of the ſame opinion, if we had been in any Country but
Forreſts, where I have heard there are ſo many diſcreet and well accompliſhed
Shepherds, as the encounter ſeems not ſo ſtrange unto me. If he be a Shepherd,
continued <hi>Alcander,</hi> and the reſt like him, it muſt needs be confeſſed that Cities
have reaſon to envie theſe Woods and ſolitary places; but ſaid he, and pointed at
a paper which lay in the place where they firſt found <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I do ſee a thing like
a letter, and perhaps the Moon will give us light to read it. <hi>Amilcar</hi> upon this took
up a paper which <hi>Sylvander</hi> accidentally dropt, in which were writ a copie of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
importing, <hi>That ſhe, ſhe only is worthy of her ſelf.</hi> It is certain, ſaid <hi>Alcander,</hi>
that he is a Shepherd, and not the Genius of this place; but it muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that theſe Woods are extreamly happy in having ſuch gueſts.</p>

                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:53527:190"/>
But <hi>Alexis</hi> in the mean time who lay according to her cuſtome in <hi>Aſtreas</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> alſo lay, ſhe was up as early as the Sun, and taking
the clothes of the fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſhe dreſt her ſelf as ſoon, and with as little noiſe as
poſſibly ſhe could: Then ſhe opened the windows, and ſet a chair cloſe by the bed,
that ſhe might the better contemplate thoſe Beauties which ſhe adored. <hi>Aſtreas</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was half turned towards her bed-fellows, and the weather being very hot, part of
her breaſt was open, and her right arm hung careleſly naked over <hi>Diana. Alexis</hi>
having a while contemplated, Alas (ſaid ſhe in a low voice, leſt ſhe ſhould be heard)
Ah <hi>Alexis!</hi> why art not thou metamorphoſed into <hi>Diana,</hi> or <hi>Diana</hi> into <hi>Alexis?</hi>
But miſerable wretch that thou art, why ſuch a wiſh, ſince <hi>Celadon</hi> then is to have
no ſhare in it? For oh <hi>Alexis!</hi> what greater favours canſt thou receive then thou
haſt: but all will not do thee any good, becauſe thou doſt not call <hi>Celadon</hi> to take
a ſhare, which it ſeems thou doſt envy him. But ſtill it cannot be envy, for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis,</hi>
canſt thou have any felicity with him, or any happineſs without her? No,
no, certainly thou canſt not: but yet his preſence is both terrible, and deſirable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me? deſirable, in that without <hi>Celadon</hi> I cannot have any perfect happineſs; and
terrible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that he would make me loſe all my hopes: when I do re-enter into my
ſelf, I do find that I am a miſcellanie of <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Celadon:</hi> and as <hi>Celadon</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to recover that happineſs which is ravi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

loſe that which I poſſeſſe. I am then both <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Celadon</hi> mingled together:
but now I know who I am; how ſhould we do to find out a way to content <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and to ſatisfie <hi>Alexis?</hi> Oh there is the work, there is all the difficulty: this is
a place ſo ſlippery, that the leaſt treading awry, is to fall into the horrid abyſſe of
deſpair. But why ſhould we think that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> wiſhes ill unto that faithfull <hi>Celadon,</hi>
ſince every time ſhe ſpeaks of him, ſhe ſeems to lament the loſſe of him? But on
the other ſide, why ſhould we not fear that ſhe does wiſh him ill, ſince having
commanded him not to ſee her till ſhe command, ſhe does not command him, though
ſhee ſee him every hour?</p>
                     <p>This laſt conſideration touched ſo to the quick, that tears dropt from his eyes,
and ſuch ſighs ſeconded thoſe tears, that <hi>Phillis</hi> waked at the wind of them, who
ſeeing it light day, after ſhe had ſaluted <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſhe roſe out of bed in her ſmock,
and went to dreſſe her ſelf by the <hi>Druide. Diana</hi> all this while ſlept ſo ſoundly, as the
noiſe which her bed-fellow made in riſing did not awake her; but had ſlept on, if
<hi>Phillis</hi> had not called her ſluggard ſeveral times: and ſpeaking very loud, it ſeems
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> was in a dream, and waked upon it; for turning towards <hi>Alexis,</hi> Ah <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi>
(ſaid ſhe with a deep ſigh) and ſaying no more, ſhe fell aſleep again. <hi>Diana</hi>
and <hi>Phillis,</hi> hearing her name <hi>Celadon,</hi> they were very attentive to hear what ſhe
would ſay farther: <hi>Alexis,</hi> though ſurpriſed at the hearing of himſelf named, yet
he ſet as good a face upon the matter as he could poſſible; and laying his finger up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his mouth, ſpeak low, (ſaid ſhe) that we may hear what ſhe will ſay of that
Shepherd: but though they were all ſilent a long while, and very attentive, yet ſhe
ſpoke no more; but perceiving that <hi>Diana</hi> kiſſed her, ſhe waked, in an opinion that
it was <hi>Alexis:</hi> Miſtris, ſaid ſhe, you are very early, and her eyes being yet not well
open, ſhe kiſſed her again in that belief: but when ſhe ſaw it was <hi>Diana,</hi> ah Siſter,
ſaid ſhe, you have deceived me, for I took you for my dear Miſtris, Servant, ſaid
the <hi>Druide</hi> then, I am not ſo far off, but you may eaſily repair that miſtake if you
pleaſe: then leaning towards her, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> kiſſed her, with as much affection as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſhe could expreſs. Well, well, (ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> who was dreſſing her ſelf, and who
ſaw how diſdainfully ſhe had repulſed <hi>Diana</hi>) you reject the kiſſes of thoſe lips, which
ſome other perhaps would ſooner chuſe then yours. Certainly, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> they are
out of their wits who makes ſo bad a choiſe. You may ſay what you pleaſe, replied
<hi>Phillis,</hi> but I believe there are ſome that are of my opinion, and that is <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
whom I believe you do not think to be out of his wits, unleſs it be in one thing;
what is that? ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> in loving too much, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> for in that indeed
he is in the exceſſe. What Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> all in one ſong? Will you ſpeak of
nothing but <hi>Sylvander, Sylvander</hi> ſtill? Are you not weary with naming him ſo oft?
Siſter, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> reſolve upon one thing; that I will never let you reſt, until you
be reconciled unto him, and he in your favour as formerly he was wont to be: and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53527:190"/>
I believe it is the part of all your friends to do the like: for if you ſhould loſe that
kind Shepherd, I do not think <hi>Lignon</hi> will ever have his like: good Siſter (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>)
what you do think of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> is not he above him? <hi>Lycidas,</hi> (replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> after
her accuſtomed jollity) is good for nothing but for me; and I ſhould be very ſorry
any ſhould envy me: but <hi>Sylvander</hi> is ſuch a one, as not only you and we, who are
ordinarily with him, but alſo all this Country, nay perhaps all the <hi>Gaules,</hi> have an
intereſt in him. Good Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhall I be payed out of the publique ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
for having a care of him, in whom ſo many have a ſhare? You ought (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Phillis</hi>) ſince you have all the power; and if he miſcarry, every one will
blame you; and though he be all yours, yet ought you not to envy, that every
one ſhould receive contentment from that which you have. I am ſo far from any
envy, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> that if he be mine, I will give him unto you with all my
heart; and with a promiſe never to ask him again. Oh moſt cruel woman, (cryed
out <hi>Phillis</hi>) the Gods will puniſh you for this ingratitude, and as they uſually do,
in the ſame manner that you offend. And remember this that I now foretel you,
with as much truth as if it came from the mouth of an Oracle. Good Siſter, replied
<hi>Diana,</hi> what is it that you do tell me? that the Gods will puniſh me for that which
I intend to do? Is it a ſin to give you that which is mine? Though I had not given
him unto you, yet ſtill he had been yours; for all that I had, was long ſince ſo. Fie,
fie, <hi>Diana,</hi> replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> theſe cruelties that are covered with a cloak of kindneſſe,
are not unknown to the Gods: you cannot ſo gild them over, but they will find
them to be counterfet ſtuf, and conſider that I ſhall ſee you weep for it; and when
that time comes, I will laugh at you, for not believing me when I was in the right.
Indeed Siſter, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> very ſeriouſly, you are extreamly unkind; you
ſhould rather provide for me good ſtore of handkerchiefs before hand, to dry up
the tears which I ſhall ſhed.</p>
                     <p>Thus theſe two Shepherdeſſes diſcourſed whilſt they were dreſſing themſelves;
and in the mean time <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> were talking, ſomtimes giving aſſurances
of their mutual good will, and otherwhiles kiſſing each other; ſomtimes as women,
and otherwhiles as lovers: and therefore <hi>Diana</hi> ſeeing <hi>Aſtrea</hi> made no offers of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
out of bed, ſhe turned to <hi>Phillis,</hi> and ſaid unto her, me thinks Siſter that though
you have been ſomthing out of charity with me this morning, yet we may go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and look to our flocks, and return again before this ſluggard riſe out of bed.
Do not think, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> that my anger is ſo great as to make me fail in that
reſpect and affection which I do ow unto her that was my Miſtris, and ever ſhall be
ſo as long as I live. And you Siſter ſluggard, ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Astrea,</hi> ſince we will
not command you any things that are either impoſſible or grievous, I pray let us
find you in the ſame place at our return, where we leave you at our going away,
and in the mean time, that you may have no excuſe for your abſence, we will take
care of your flock: ſo bidding them good morrow, they went out of the chamber,
and went talking upon ſeveral ſubjects: and <hi>Diana</hi> being in a little better opinion of
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> then ſhe was, ſhe began to be in her good humour again.</p>
                     <p>Being then going out of <hi>Aſtreas</hi> houſe, <hi>Phillis</hi> who was ſilent a while, did make
a ſtop upon a ſudden; and looking upon <hi>Diana,</hi> Siſter, ſaid ſhe unto her, dare I tell
you, what I am thinking upon? Why do you make it a queſtion? anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> you
know our familiarity does not allow us to conceal the leaſt motion of our ſouls from
each other: I was thinking, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> upon the extream and ſudden amity betwixt
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis;</hi> and what ſhould be the cauſe of it? I have known <hi>Aſtrea</hi> long,
but I never ſaw her ſo apt and forward to contract amity upon a puſh, with a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and leave her old, for new affections: and yet ſhe no ſooner ſaw this <hi>Druide,</hi>
but ſhe loved her extreamly, and in loving her does a little ſlight the company of
<hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> who were wont to be ſo dear unto her. To which <hi>Diana</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
I have had the ſame conceptions, Siſter, ſaid ſhe; but then conſidering that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strea</hi>
did extreamly love <hi>Celadon,</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> having ſo great a reſemblance of him,
ſhe was quickly moved to love her, as fancying her to be her dearly beloved Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd;
you know ſhe never loved any but only him: as this being her firſt and only
affection, it is no wonder ſhe ſhould keep it alive in this woman; well (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>)
this reaſon may paſs, as relating unto <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but what do you alledge as in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53527:191"/>
to the <hi>Druide,</hi> who at the very firſt ſight, was ſo wholly devoted unto a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs,
that ſhe forgets and forſakes her very Father and kindred, to be with this
Shepherdeſs, and to wear her clothes; and ſeems as if ſhe had quite forgot both <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes</hi>
and all her companions. Unto this, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> no anſwer can be made, but
that as <hi>Alexis</hi> has the face of <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſo alſo ſhe has his heart: and for my part, I
believe ſhe has, when I do ſee her Idolize, after the ſame manner that Shepherds uſe.
I aſſure you, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> you phraſe it right, in ſaying that ſhe does Idolize
her, as if ſhe were a Shepherd: have you obſerved her actions and behaviour when
ſhe is with her? I aſſure you Siſter, that were ſhe trimmed up in mans clothes, I
would ſay, here is a Shepherd. Siſter, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> you know that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> has rare
attracts to move love, and having an affection unto this woman, ſhe renders her
all the teſtimonies of her good will that ſhe can, we ought not to think it ſtrange
that her natural perfections ſhould become inchantments; we have found it our
ſelves by experience, and I dare ſwear that never any loved better, then we loved
<hi>Aſtrea;</hi> and I do believe that I cannot love any more then her. But (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>)
what ſhall we ſay of <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Leonide,</hi> who have left her here upon ſo ſlight a
cauſe, and ſeem as if they had forgotten her? When <hi>Adamas</hi> went, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi>
we know ſhe was not well; and when <hi>Leonide</hi> left her, ſhe went away in haſte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Nymph <hi>Amaſis</hi> did ſend for her, ſo as ſhe had not leiſure to conduct her
unto the houſe of <hi>Adamas:</hi> and why, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> did ſhe not carry her with her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Marſell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s,</hi> where her Father was? I cannot well anſwer you unto that point,
ſaid <hi>Diana:</hi> but I do believe that <hi>Adamas</hi> would not have her, ſhe being a <hi>Druide,</hi>
go amongſt great companies, but deſired rather ſhe ſhould paſſe the time away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, and recover of that ſickneſſe which ſo long tormented her, which was
the reaſon of her coming from <hi>Carnutes,</hi> whither as I hear ſay ſhe is preſently to
return.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Diana</hi> anſwered unto all the objections in the diſcourſe of <hi>Phillis,</hi> as ſhe
did in real ſincerity think of <hi>Alexis;</hi> and uſed ſuch good arguments to clear her
doubts, that ſhe quite removed them. Afterwards, they walked unto the Wood,
where they thought to find no Shepherds ſtirring, becauſe it was very early; but
when they came into a long walk, they ſaw at the other end a Shepherd and a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe,
but they could not know whom they were, by reaſon of the diſtance of
the place, and ſhade of trees. Theſe two Shepherdeſſes deſiring no other company
but themſelves, their deſign was to hide themſelves in the Wood, until the other
couple was walked paſt them, and then to continue on their own intended walk; and
therefore finding a thick Buſh by the walk ſide, they ſat themſelves down in it with
a reſerve of ſilence till they were paſt; and therefore they heard them coming when
they were at a good diſtance off, and becauſe they were ſomthing loud in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
they knew by their voices the one of them to be <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Yonder is (ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> in a whiſper) the good friend of <hi>Sylvander:</hi> and rather
mine (anſwered <hi>Diana</hi>) for ſhe has acquainted me with that which of all things in
the world was moſt neceſſary for me to know. Well Siſter, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> I hope
to ſee the day when you will ſee your errour, and then you will take me under the
notion of your good friend: <hi>Diana</hi> durſt not anſwer, leſt they ſhould be heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

you are the moſt ſpiteful woman in the world: <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Sylvander</hi> are not
to be blamed, for they were obliged unto all they did, and not by their own choice,
but by the will of the Gods. <hi>Tirces,</hi> anſwered ſhe, do you not know that thoſe who
have been beaten with a rod, and cannot be revenged upon them that beat them,
yet they receive ſome contentment, in throwing the rod into the fire and burning
it? <hi>Tircis,</hi> by fortune, ſtopped juſt at the place where the two Shepherdeſſes were
hid in a Buſh: and admiring at the wickedneſs of <hi>Laonice;</hi> what (ſaid he unto her)
do you infer from that? I infer, replied <hi>Laonice,</hi> that though I cannot be revenged
of the Gods, from whom I have received this injuſtice, yet I will be revenged upon
the rod wherewith they have beaten me, which is upon yonder Miſtris Minks <hi>Phillis.</hi>
and Miſtris Orator <hi>Sylvander:</hi> What? do you think I have ſojourned ſo long upon

ſince the day, that judgment was pronounced, by which I loſt all my hopes of you,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53527:191"/>
I have been pretily well revenged upon <hi>Phillis;</hi> for I ſowed ſuch ſeeds of ſedition
betwixt her and <hi>Licidas,</hi> as have brought forth the fruits of many a diſquiet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> are you not afraid left the Gods ſhould command the earth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and ſwallow you up alive? All's one for that, replied ſhe, and ſmiled, there
is nothing ſo ſweet as revenge: And as for the Gods, they do not meddle in ſuch
matters as theſe. 'Tis true, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> unleſs to puniſh them. Come, come, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Laonice,</hi> The Gods have reſerved the heavens for themſelves, and have left the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Tircis</hi> went back two or three paces, and folding his arms, ſtood looking upon her
with admiration, and ſpoke not a word. At laſt, he asked her what ſhe had done
unto <hi>Sylvander?</hi> What have I done? anſwered ſhe; why I have given him ſuch a
blow, that a Chirurgion will hardly ſalve up his ſore; for I ſee, as good a face as
<hi>Diana</hi> ſets upon it, the pain of it does reach his heart. But, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> what do
you tell me of pains of heart, or of <hi>Diana?</hi> I ask you what you have done unto
<hi>Sylvander?</hi> You are very inquiſitive, replied <hi>Laonice,</hi> and to ſatisfie you this is
enough, That I am ſo well ſatisfied in my revenge, that I will not now ſtay a minute
longer in this Country where I have received theſe two contentments: The one is,
the jealouſie of <hi>Lycidas</hi> againſt <hi>Phillis;</hi> and the other, of <hi>Diana</hi> againſt <hi>Sylvander.</hi>
But replied <hi>Tircis,</hi> How can <hi>Diana</hi> be jealous of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> if ſhe do not care for
him; and if <hi>Sylvander</hi> did never look upon any in the way of Love? Oh <hi>Tircis,</hi>
replied <hi>Laonice,</hi> if their love or their hatred would have been advantagious unto
you, as they are unto me, you would have obſerved them better then you have.
You think (ſaid <hi>Tircis</hi>) that all their diſcourſes of Love did proceed from affection:
But do you not know them to be only in jeſt, and cauſed by a wager betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi>
and him? Ah Shepherd, ſaid <hi>Laonice</hi> and ſmiled, I perceive that you are one of
thoſe that believe all that is reported. But my good friend <hi>Tircis,</hi> if you had loved
me, as well as he loves her, aſſure your ſelf he had never been my Judge; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, <hi>Diana</hi> loves him as well, as <hi>Phillis</hi> her <hi>Lycidas,</hi> nay better, until I did her
the good office of putting her into a little doubt. Content your ſelf with this I have
told you, and that I tell you no more, though I could very much, leſt you ſhould
know how to remedie it. The perſons who are able to verifie the contrary, are all
abſent, and will not return of a long time to tell them the truth: But truſt me, I
have not omitted any circumſtance that might conduce unto my full revenge, either
in the manner, or in the time, or in the perſons that I have alledged. <hi>Tircis</hi> did
let her talk on a long time, and did ſuffer her to vomit up all her malice, to the end
he might gather ſomthing that might be a remedy againſt it: But ſeeing that ſhe
would not out with any thing more, he loſt all patience. Go, go you damned witch,
ſaid he unto her in a fury, you fiend of hell, ſent hither upon earth to torment hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes;
thou doſt not retain any thing of a woman but only thy habit, and thy
name; having under that ſhape the ſpirit of a Divel: Hence, hence thou horrid
Hag, get thee out of this happy Country, where ſuch malignant monſters muſt not
inhabite: Let thy venomous and impure heart know, that though thou mayeſt eſcape
the juſtice of men, yet thou canſt not of the Gods, whom I moſt heartily beſeech
to deliver me out of thy wretched hands, and from all thy wicked, malicious, and
damned devices.</p>
                     <p>Upon this he turned from her, and went a great pace, the ſame way he came, and
left <hi>Laonice</hi> ſo aſtoniſhed at his reproofs, which her guilty conſcience told her were
true, that ſhe all confuſion, ſtood a while immoveable, looking after him, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not a word; at laſt, when he was gone out of ſight, ſhe went the other way
into the thick of the wood, and would not ſhew her ſelf unto any in the Country, but
went away unto the place from whence ſhe came, being able to ſay, that ſhe left none
behind her that was ſorry for her departure.</p>

and looked at <hi>Phillis;</hi> who after three or four times biting her lips, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her head, ſhe clapped both her hands upon <hi>Dianas,</hi> Siſter, ſaid ſhe unto her,
do you ſee how true all your jealouſies and ſuſpitions are? What do you now
think of the poor Shepherds innocency? Where is all that confidence and belief
which you had of this malicious woman? I muſt confeſs (ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and roſe up)
that without any wrong unto her I may ſay, never was wickedneſs and ſubtilty equal
unto her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. But Siſter, (continued ſhe, and entring into the walk) could any ever
imagine this woman ſhould ever take ſuch great and long pains to be revenged upon
poor innocents? For truly <hi>Sylvander</hi> and you are both innocent of her diſpleaſure,
ſince you were choſen unto that office which you did her, by lot and hazard. But
ſuppoſe that you were culpable; what have <hi>Lycidas</hi> and I done, that could give her
ſo great offence? Did you not hear her ſay, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that rather then want
her revenge upon one enemy, ſhe would ruine a hundred friends? Good God, ſaid
<hi>Diana,</hi> keep us from any ſuch friends. Now <hi>Diana,</hi> replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> learn from hence,
that all which is ſaid, is not always true, though never ſo probable: Moſt true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Diana,</hi> for who could avoid believing this piece of wickedneſſe? Conſider,
I beſeech you, how cunningly ſhe made her relation, and upon what likely proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
ſhe grounded it? How ſubtilely did ſhe take her time when <hi>Madonthe</hi> went
away, and <hi>Sylvander</hi> accompanied her? So as every circumſtance was a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what ſhe had related: Oh Siſter, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> thoſe that live with ſuch
turbulent ſpirits as theſe, had need be well adviſed, I muſt confeſſe, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> that
I was deceived; but the falſhood was ſo contrived as I was not to blame, but on the
contrary, had been blamable if I had not been deceived by it; for I did thereby
make it appear that my pure and innocent ſoul was free from any ſuch wickedneſſe,
ſo as I could not imagine any ſuch thoughts could enter into any other. But <hi>Diana</hi>
(ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi>) what ſhall we do to poor <hi>Sylvander,</hi> whoſe ſorrows may be his death,
and who perhaps is looking for ſome way to finiſh his diſaſterous life? I ſhould be
very ſorry, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> that <hi>Sylvander</hi> ſhould receive any harm, for I plainly
ſee he is not culpable, and the firſt time that I ſee him, that ſame hand which gave
the wound, ſhall cure it.</p>
                     <p>I pray God, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that deſpair do not drive him into ſome deſperate
courſe: No, no, ſaid <hi>Diana, Sylvander</hi> is not in any ſuch danger; deſpair will not
eaſily work upon ſuch a ſpirit as his. Yet let me tell you, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of ſuch a cold conſtitution, as his, when griefs ſeiſes upon them, are apt for
ſtrange reſolutions. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> as ſtrong conſtitutions when a Fever ſeiſes
upon them, have fits more violent then thoſe that are weak, ſo alſo can they reſiſt
them better, and endure them longer. It is the ſame with ſuch ſtrong ſpirits as that
of <hi>Sylvander;</hi> it is certain, they are more ſenſible of pain, but then they are more
able to endure and reſiſt it: However Siſter, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> let not this confidence
make him endure any longer pain: I am confident, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> that we ſhall ſee
him ſometime this day, and then, he ſhall not depart without a good remedy, if he
be in any ſuch neceſſity of it, as you think he is. But in the interim I conceive it beſt
to take our way towards <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> and acquaint them with the mornings
adventures. Upon this they made their courſe towards the houſe of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> whom
they found ſtill in bed.</p>
                     <p>For as ſoon as theſe two companions were gone out of the chamber, in lieu of
dreſſing her ſelf, ſhe was talking with <hi>Alexis,</hi> and ſhewing her ſuch abundance of
good will, that the diſguiſed <hi>Druide</hi> was hardly able to reſiſt ſo many expreſſions of
favour; and the truth is, never was any lover ſo near delights without a taſte, as <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi>
was under the guiſe of a woman, which he durſt not throw off. This conſtraint
went ſo againſt the grain of this diſguiſed <hi>Druide,</hi> that ſhe bluſhed ſeveral times,
which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> perceiving; Miſtris, ſaid ſhe, I am afraid, that you are not well; for
I have obſerved your colour to change ſeveral times, I beſeech you, uſe no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
for you cannot be in any place of the world, where you have more power
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53527:192"/>
then in this houſe. Servant, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> I value not the pain, as I do the
favour which you do me, in obſerving the colour in my face: 'Tis true indeed, I am
not well, but it does not much trouble me, for it is only a dreg of my laſt great ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which I am often troubled with, but it will be paſt immediately, and I am
ſorry that you took any notice of it. Ah Miſtris, replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you ſuffer no pain
which is little unto me, and you do me wrong in concealing it from me, ſince I
might as your ſervant have ſought out for ſome remedy. Servant, replied the <hi>Druide,</hi>
I perceive that you do love <hi>Alexis,</hi> more then ſhe deſerves, but never trouble your
ſelf at her pain, for my body is not in ſo much diſorder as my mind. Your mind,
ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I beſeech you Miſtris, what is it that can be a trouble to it? Does not
all things comply even to your very wiſhes? Have you not a Father that loves and
cheriſhes you above all his children? Are you not ſupplied with every thing your
heart can deſire? Moreover, are you not eſteemed and honoured by all that ſee you?
What then is it that can poſſibly trouble your mind? You have forgot one thing,
ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> which would be a greater contentment unto me then all the world,
and which I deſire to poſſeſſe before it, which is, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> will love <hi>Alexis:</hi> Oh
God, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and embraced and kiſſed <hi>Alexis,</hi> it is a ſin impardonable,
if Miſtris you do not think I love you: Yes, yes, Miſtris, I do love you, and love you
ſo, that I wiſh Heaven may never love me if I do not, and puniſh me with eternal
torments, when I have the leaſt thought of any ceaſing to love and honour you.
Do not ſay that you do love me, anſwered the <hi>Druide,</hi> but that you do love <hi>Alexis.</hi>
I do not underſtand (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) what you mean by that; but I am ſure that if I do
love <hi>Alexis,</hi> it is not the name; for if you had any other, my love to you will be
ſtill the ſame; and if you will know what it is that I do love, it is your perſon, your
ſpirit, and your merit. Suppoſe I were not a <hi>Druide,</hi> replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> would you
love me then? I would to God. anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that without any prejudice to
your ſelf, you were for my contentments ſake a Shepherdeſs of <hi>Lignon,</hi> for then
I ſhould hope that the equallity which would be betwixt us, would more invite you
to accept of my affection. Suppoſe alſo, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that I were a Shepherd, would
you ſtill continue the ſame good will unto me? Unto that (replied <hi>Aſtrea</hi> very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly)
I will anſwer very freely, that it is abſolutely impoſſible for me to love you
any otherwiſe then I doe. And truly it would not well become me to love a man ſo
well as I do you; and though it were permitted me, yet I think that I could not;
it is enough that I did love one, and therefore will love no more men. <hi>Alexis</hi> was
ſorry her curioſity had gone ſo far; but ſince the Ice was broke, ſhe would ſtep a
little farther. I knew ſervant (ſaid ſhe unto her) that it was only <hi>Alexis</hi> whom
you loved, and not her perſon; for otherwiſe, if the Gods ſhould make me become
a Shepherd, why ſhould you then ceaſe to love me? If the Gods ſhould do ſo, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I ſhould have an occaſion to complain againſt them for depriving
me of all the happineſs that I hoped ever to receive: and from that time, I would
bid adieu unto all delights and contentment. But why ſhould you not ſtill love me,
ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſince my body would be ſtill my body, and my mind and ſoul, ſtill the
ſame? Alas Miſtris, anſwered the Shepherdeſs, what would you have me ſay? This
is all I am able to ſay, that it ſhall never be ſaid, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did love two Shepherds.
I beſeech you, dear Miſtris. no more of this diſcourſe; for though I know that ſuch a
change cannot be, yet the very imagination of ſuch a thing does freeze my blood to
Ice; and indeed ſhe did begin to look very pale in the face: Which <hi>Alexis</hi> ſeeing,
and thinking it not good to drive the nail to the head, ſhe ſaid thus unto her: Well
ſervant, ſaid ſhe, I will not talk any longer upon this ſubject, upon condition you
will tell me, what you dreamed this morning when you waked: with all my heart,
anſwered <hi>Astrea,</hi> if I can but remember it: but Miſtris, continued ſhe, why do you
deſire it? Becauſe, anſwered the <hi>Druide,</hi> as you were betwixt ſleep and waking, I
heard you ſay, as you turned towards me, in a pitifully complaining voice, ah <hi>Celadon:</hi>
Miſtris, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> by that word you put me in memory of part of my dream,
which otherwiſe I ſhould have forgotten; I dream't that I was in a grove ſo thick
with trees, bryers, and ruſhes, that I tore all my clothes; and the obſcurity of the
place did hinder me from ſeeing which way I ſhould paſſe; at laſt after much ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and long labour in vain to get out of this place, me thought I ſaw one, whom I
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53527:193"/>
did not know by reaſon of the darkneſs; coming towards me, and ſaid, holding her
hand before her face, that if I would follow her, ſhe would help me out of that
thorny Labyrinth wherein I was: After I was helped out, me thought I thanked
her for her aſſiſtance, and went following her; and followed her, until both of us
were ſo wildered, that neither of us could get out of the Wood: At laſt me-thought
that ſome one coming betwixt my guide and me to part us, ſhe graſped my hand ſo
cloſe, and I clung ſo cloſe unto her, that the other was forced to uſe all the ſtrength
he had to part us; and at laſt, he pulled off the hand of her that guided me. At
the ſame time me-thought I ſaw a little light, and therefore deſiring to look upon
the hand which remained in mine, I found it to be a heart which panted, until he who
had ſevered me from my guide, returned with a great knife in his hand, and do what
I could, did give the heart ſuch a blow, that it made me all bloody: The horrour of
this did make me throw it away upon the ground; which I had no ſooner done, but
I ſaw that the heart was turned into <hi>Celadon;</hi> which put me into ſuch a fright, that it
cauſed me to cry out as you heard me, and then I waked.</p>
                     <p>This dream, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> does certainly ſignifie ſomthing; for though moſt of
them be falſe, and only impreſſions of things precedent, which we have either ſeen
or heard; and ſomtimes are only vapours ariſing from a ſurcharged ſtomack or elſe
from the complexion, and according to the good or bad conſtitution of the Body:
yet this has none of thoſe qualities which dreams uſe to have; for they are full of
non-ſenſe, and have neither head nor feet: but this is a compoſed ſtory, and holds a
correſpondency in all parts, alſo it was in the morning, when vapours from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
could work no effects: ſo as if you pleaſe, I can give you the interpretation
of it. I ſhould think my ſelf much obliged (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) if you would be pleaſed to
take the pains.</p>
                     <p>This Wood ſo full of thorns and obſcurity (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) wherein you were, and
out of which you were ſo out of all hopes to get out, is the troubles and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
wherein you are; ſhe who appeared and offered her ſelf as a guide through this
labyrinth, repreſents my ſelf; He which would ſever us, is, that I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to return unto <hi>Carnutes</hi> by <hi>Adamas;</hi> we muſt both reſiſt as much as we can,
at the laſt they will part us, but I ſhall leave my heart with you, which you ſhall take
in lieu of <hi>Celadons;</hi> and in the knowledge of this you ſhall live more contentedly
then ever you did.</p>
                     <p>Ah Miſtris (ſaid <hi>Astrea</hi>) I like well the interpretation of my dream, but for that
ſad ſeparation; and that indeed I cannot ſuffer, nor me thinks ſhould you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Does it
not grieve you to part from ſuch a ſervant as loves you with ſo much paſſionate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as ſhe thinks the time of parting to be the time of her death? As ſhe utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
theſe words, tears trickled down her fair checks; and becauſe <hi>Alexis</hi> looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, and ſpake not, ſhe continued: Ah Miſtris, Miſtris, will you not afford me
one word of comfort? Is it poſſible you ſhould ever conſent unto any ſeparation?
Judge you, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> whether I conſent unto it or no, ſince your dream tells
me, that I am to leave my heart with you; and do you think I would not be where
it is? Oh Miſtris, replied the Shepherdeſs, this is not enough to give me ſatisfaction;
but ſwear unto me you will not, by that thing which will moſt inviolably oblige you
unto it. Then it ſhall be (replied <hi>Alexis</hi>) by the affection which I do bear unto the
fair <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> Be it by what it will (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) ſo it be by an oath inviolable. Swear
unto me, deareſt Miſtris, that you will never forſake me, and in retaliation, I will
ſwear unto you by the ſoul of that perſon whom I loved moſt, and by my affection
unto you, and alſo by all that is ſacred, that neither any oppoſition of parents, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of eſtate, or any other reſpect whatſoever that can be imagined, ſhall
ever be able to ſeparate me from my deareſt Miſtris, whom I do embrace (ſaid ſhe,
and took her in her arms) and will never let her go out of my arms, until ſhe has made
this oath. <hi>Alexis</hi> then embracing her alſo, Servant (ſaid ſhe) I do ſwear unto you
by the affection which I bear unto you, which is all I have; I ſwear unto you by <hi>Ife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas,
Bellinus, Tharamis,</hi> the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> and I ſwear by your ſelf <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whom I pray heaven I may never be happy, That neither the authority of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor the obedience I owe unto my Superiours, nor any thing under the cope of
heaven, ſhall ever ſeparate me from fair <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Upon this kiſſing each other, to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53527:193"/>
the extream contentment of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and incredible ſatisfaction of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> they parted
nor, till they heard one open the door of the chamber: and then, leſt they ſhould be
ſeen, <hi>Alexis</hi> ſate down in her ſeat, and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> continued in bed. Then <hi>Diana</hi> and
<hi>Phillis</hi> entred; and <hi>Phillis</hi> in a joyful manner cryed victory, victory, we have got
the victory: here is this incenſed woman (pointing at <hi>Diana</hi>) here ſhe is, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
all ſhe ſaid, and all ſhe did was wrong: Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> ſoft and fair; you go
a little too faſt and far: for I do not confeſſe that I was in the wrong, but indeed I
ſay that I was deceived, and the opinion which I had of that Shepherd was falſe:
but that I did it in believing what was told me, I am ſo far from confeſſing, that I
think I had done ill, if I had done otherwiſe. But I beſeech you Siſters (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>)
exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd your words, that this fair <hi>Druide</hi> and I may rejoyce with you: Ah ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> as deep in bed yet as when we left you? Had we two been in bed
ſtill as you are, we had never underſtood what we do, which you deſire to know:
may I not ſee him to day that I Love beſt if I do tell you. Then tell it to me, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis;</hi>
yes to you I will, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> becauſe you were the cauſe of our riſing ſo ſoon,
and conſequently of the encounter which we met withall, and which only could
drive that angry Shepherdeſs out of that opinion which ſhe entertained; had we
miſſed this occaſion, we had never recovered it, becauſe ſhe who hatched and brought
forth all theſe traiterous deviſes, went away as ſoon as ever ſhe had (unknown to
her ſelf) done this good office unto <hi>Sylvander.</hi> Hereupon ſhe related the whole
diſcourſe betwixt <hi>Laonice</hi> and <hi>Tircis,</hi> and forgot not a ſillable of thoſe things which
<hi>Laonice</hi> ſpoke, either againſt her, or againſt poor <hi>Sylvander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is now, ſaid ſhe, that cholerick <hi>Diana</hi> convinced; ſhe that would not give
credit unto any but <hi>Laonice;</hi> who thought that ſhe only could ſpeak the truth, and
that poor ſilly we were all lyers: I thank God, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for conducting both
you and <hi>Diana</hi> ſo opportunely to hear her, and all her trechery; for had you been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated,
I verily believe <hi>Diana</hi> would not have believed your reports: nay, though
ſhe her ſelf had heard it without a witneſs, it would have been a long time before
ſhe would have confeſſed her knowledge. 'Tis true, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> and I thank
the goodneſſe of Heaven that has ſo happily directed me to the only means that
could clear all my doubts. From hence may be obſerved (ſaid the <hi>Druide</hi>) that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
is never left without a helper, ſince the poor and innocent <hi>Sylvander</hi> has
found it when his hopes were moſt remote. And ſee, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> how good Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is, and how ſomtimes to our conſolation it cauſeth future things to be foretold
by perſons who ſpeak them in jeſt, I my ſelf have found this to be ſo in this accident;
for when I was honoured in the habit of my Miſtris; I told <hi>Sylvander</hi> that within
three dayes he ſhould ſee an end of the pain wherein he was, I ſpoke it only to keep
him alive by infuſing this hope, and not that I thought it would come to paſſe: yet
you ſee, I foretold the event as truly as if I had received it from the mouth of a God.
To make your predictions true, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> it is very requiſite and full time you riſe
out of your bed, that we may go unto the place where <hi>Sylvander</hi> uſes to be, unleſs
you will carry your bed with you into the wood, where we will go and deſire that
Shepherd to bring you your ſmock. Neither you nor he need to take that pains,
anſwered <hi>Astrea,</hi> pray go you unto him, and bring him hither into this chamber,
where he never yet was whilſt I was in my bed: Is it poſſible? ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> no I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, ſaid <hi>Astrea,</hi> neither he nor any other Shepherd, and of this I dare take an
oath. Never ſwear, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> unleſſe you be moſt certainly aſſured: I believe
you do think ſo, but perhaps you may be deceived, and what do you know but that
there may at this time be one concealed and hid? You are pleaſed to jear me; replied
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but believe it Miſtris, we do keep a more reſerved diſtance with the Shepherds
of <hi>Lignon,</hi> then you do think we do. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> the time was when
I durſt have taken ſuch an oath as that, which if I had, you know I had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn.
However, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> if you will pleaſe to give me a little leiſure, I will dreſſe
my ſelf to ſave <hi>Sylvander</hi> a labour of coming hither.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, <hi>Alexis</hi> roſe up and fetched her own cloaths unto her dear Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs,
Servant, ſaid ſhe, I would have you take my cloaths; be you my Miſtris and
call me ſervant; and when I take them, then I will be the Miſtris, and you the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
What will people ſay, anſwered <hi>Astrea,</hi> when they hear me call you ſo? They
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53527:194"/>
will ſay, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> that it were ſtrange if you ſhould call me otherwiſe, I being
in the habit of a Shepherdeſſe, and you in a <hi>Druides,</hi> and ſo of me, if I ſhould call
you by any other name then Miſtris: for my part, ſaid <hi>Astrea,</hi> I had rather fail, by
obeying you, then not to do as you command; and to ſhew my obedience: Servant,
ſaid ſhe, if you do not help me to put on this Gown, I aſſure you I am ſo ignorant,
that I know not where to begin. <hi>Alexis</hi> then took <hi>Aſtrea</hi> by one hand, did put
that into one arm of the Gown; and then getting upon the bed, did put her other
arm into the ſleeve of the Gown, and with ſo much contentment, or rather rapture,
that ſhe knew not what ſhe did: for this new <hi>Druide</hi> did ſo confidently believe her
to be a woman, that ſhe did not hide any thing from her. At the laſt, ſhe was dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
and becauſe it was ſomthing late, they left the houſe, and went all together to
bid <hi>Phocion</hi> good morrow, who ſeeing them diſguiſed in this manner, did at the firſt,
miſtake them; but afterwards taking better notice of them, he was extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
at it. But theſe fair Shepherdeſſes had ſuch a deſire to put <hi>Sylvander</hi> out of
his pain, that without entertaining any motions of dinner from <hi>Phocion,</hi> they all
took their leaves of him, and went unto the place where they hoped to meet <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sylvander,</hi> after he had got into the wood to avoid the company of <hi>Alcander</hi>
and his Brother, went walking and wandering up and down all the night, until it
was break of day; and he by fortune found himſelf upon the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> where
reſting himſelf, ſleep ſo ſeiſed upon his eyes, that the Sun was a good height, when
ſome dogs of the neighbouring Towns running at wolves, did awake him. Before
his mind was thus tormented with theſe turbulent perplexities, if he had heard the
barking of a dog, he would have been the firſt of all the Shepherds in running to
preſerve either his own or his friends flocks: but now, he ſtirred no more then if he
had no intereſt in any flocks; which ſhews that the ſtronger paſſion makes the ſoul
contemn the weaker. By fortune at the ſame time an Officer who uſed to wait at
the Oracle of <hi>Mount-Verdune,</hi> and who knew <hi>Sylvander,</hi> paſſing by him, and ſeeing
him not ſtir at the courſe of the dogs, he did much wonder at it; and had an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that he was not well, becauſe it was not his cuſtom to ſit ſtill upon ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
But coming to him, and ſeeing no ſigns of any ſickneſſe in his face, becauſe he
diſſembled the anguiſh of his looks and mind, when he ſaw him approach: how now
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſaid he unto him, who would have thought you ſo backward in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the common enemy to our flocks? I know not of what enemies you ſpeak,
anſwered <hi>Sylvander</hi> ſoberly, for there are ſo many ſorts of them, that he who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to purſue them all, has work enough; truly, ſaid the Officer, I know that
the Gods do intend ſome great and miſerable miſ-fortune towards us; and there is
not any more certain ſign of a Countries ruine, then when <hi>Tautates</hi> takes from it
great and eminent perſons, by whoſe counſels and valour it was preſerved: and
when the reſt are careleſſe of its welfare and defence. And why, ſaid <hi>Sylvander,</hi> do
you ſpeak theſe words? Becauſe, anſwered the Officer, all the victimes which we
Sacrifice, are found ſo defective, that they do aſtoniſh all the Sacrificers; ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
never hapned in my dayes; I ſay miſ-fortunes, becauſe it is a preſage of
the worſt miſ-fortunes that can befal us: and now, at this time, I ſee that <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
who was wont to be the moſt careful man in all the Country, in the preſervation of
his eſtate and flock, is now grown careleſs, and ſeems as if the publique loſs did no
more concern him, then if he had no ſhare in it. You ought not, replied <hi>Sylvander</hi>
then, to conclude of an augure from my actions: for firſt, Heaven would not have
them take notice of a perſon ſo miſerable as I am: and next, I am worth ſo little, that
it ought not to be conſiderable. The Officer then anſwered; there is an exceſs, as
well in too much deſpiſing, as in too much eſteeming ones ſelf: and ſomtimes as much
vanity and pride in the one as the other; as the Philoſopher told him who to ſhew
how much he deſpiſed rich and coſtly habits, did wear an old rotten cloak full of
holes; take heed, ſaid the Philoſopher, that your pride do not appear through the

of your ſelf then you deſerve, you be not chargeable with the ſame fault: all
that knows <hi>Sylvander,</hi> knows alſo his merit, and his capacity, and what eſteem he is
in this Country; and therefore to ſpeak againſt the opinion of every one, is either,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53527:194"/>
that he would declare himſelf his own enemy, or elſe would give occaſion to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended

on his way, leaving <hi>Sylvander</hi> in ſome ſort aſhamed of the eſteem which he had
of him.</p>
                     <p>This thought ſtayed him a while in that place; at laſt returning unto that which
moſt touched him to the quick: and conſidering the inevitable accident which was
faln upon him that was ſo innocent, he thought that Heaven was certainly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

conſideration of himſelf; to the end that ſubmitting himſelf unto him from whom
all true conſolations can come, he might receive that remedy which he ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

and holding up his hand to Heaven, he implored aide: and at the ſame time reſolved

                     <p>When the ſad Shepherd received this cruel anſwer, he ſtood as immoveable, but
not ſo inſenſible as a rock; for ſuch was his reſentment, that after he had folded his
arms, he fell down, and for a very long time gave no ſign of life, unleſs by the
tears that flowed from his eyes: ſo that the <hi>Vacies</hi> and <hi>Eubages</hi> there preſent, were
exceedingly moved to compaſſion; but he anſwered them all with ſilence, turning
his eyes only upon him that ſpoke, but in ſuch a pitiful manner, that he forced tears
from the eyes of all the company. At laſt, a good part of the day being paſt, he
went from <hi>Mount-Verdune</hi> without ſpeaking a word, and ſo retired himſelf into
the great wood next the long walk, not with any other deſign but to be in that
place, where <hi>Phillis</hi> delivered that cruel meſſage unto him, thinking that the ſight
of this place would augment his grief, and ſo much the ſooner end his miſerable life,
in which he hoped for no manner of content.</p>
                     <p>But by fortune, <hi>Alexis, Astrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> came thither at the ſame
time, to paſſe away the heat of the day, according to their cuſtom. <hi>Phillis</hi> was
the firſt who ſpied the Shepherd, and ſhewed him preſently unto her companions:
ſhe would have called unto him, but <hi>Diana</hi> did prevent her, ſaying, I would not
have him think that I have been jealous, for ſuch a ſpirit as his would draw no ſmall
conſequences from ſuch a thought. What then, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> would you have us
do? We muſt and ſo muſt you, have compaſſion upon his pain. True, anſwered
the Shepherdeſs, but you muſt alſo have compaſſion upon me; and me thinks it is
not a matter of ſuch ſmal concernment unto me, but it deſerves very great conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
upon this, ſhe turned towards <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> who were a little retired,
and propounded unto them the difficulty which ſhe found in the buſineſs. It is a
hard caſe, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that one ſhould take ſo much pains to conceal truth. What
truth Madam, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> do you ſpeak of? You would not have <hi>Sylvander</hi>
know that you love him, anſwered <hi>Alexis;</hi> and to hide this truth from him, you
are pumping for ſome tricks and artifices to delude him: is it not much better to
live freely with him, as you ſee this fair Shepherdeſs and I do? Madam, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi>
you and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> are both of one ſex, and therefore allowed. But, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> what
do you think then of <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Lycidas?</hi> I do think Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> that if <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde</hi>
my Mother would approve of <hi>Sylvanders</hi> marriage and mine, as <hi>Artemis</hi> does
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53527:195"/>
of that between <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Lycidas,</hi> perhaps then I ſhould make no difficulty to do
as <hi>Phillis</hi> does: but knowing that this a thing impoſſible, why ſhould I make my
good will appear unto this Shepherd? It would not perhaps avail him any thing at
all, but perhaps bring much harm unto me; for I know that I will never chuſe a
Husband without <hi>Belindes</hi> conſent, and I am moſt confident that ſhe will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto a marriage betwixt <hi>Sylvander</hi> and me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> then began to ſpeak; I do not know, ſaid ſhe, of what mind and humour
<hi>Belinde</hi> is, having never ſeen her; but I do find <hi>Sylvander</hi> to be a man ſo very well
qualified, as I cannot think but if <hi>Belinde</hi> knew him, ſhe would approve of this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance.
For a man is to be preferred before eſtate, I mean ſuch a man as <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
whoſe qualities are ſo highly eſtimable, as ſuch another is not to be found in all <hi>Gaul.</hi>
Oh Madam, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> virtue now a dayes does get but little credit, if it be not
ſet off with riches: beſides this, my Parents will never conſent that I ſhould give my
ſelf unto a perſon that is unknown: one whoſe fate is ſo diſaſterous, that he himſelf
does not know who was either his Father, or his Mother, or his Country. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> is very conſiderable; but as we conclude that a Roſe
grows upon a Roſe-tree, ſo may we the ſame of <hi>Sylvander;</hi> ſeeing him ſo full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
perfections, who can doubt but that he is deſcended from Excellent and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Parents? Theſe conjectures, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> are very good; but it belongs not
unto me, neither to urge them any farther, nor to deny them: but for my part, I
will lay all the fault upon <hi>Phillis.</hi> Upon me, replied ſhe, I beſeech you wherein am
I culpable? Was is not you, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſmiled, which did him all the harm in
telling him? This is an excellent good reaſon indeed, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> it was I
that did him all the harm in telling him: pray who did all the harm in putting me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and giving me a commiſſion for it, nay preſſing me unto it? I ſee, anſwered
<hi>Diana,</hi> that it is an eaſie matter to give a commiſſion, but a very hard matter to give
prudence and diſcretion to execute it. And good my Lady Embaſſador, who gave
you any inſtructions, to run and tell <hi>Sylvander</hi> every word which paſſion did ſhake
from my tongue? You whoſe paſſions were calm, and judgment free and ſound, why
did you not ſtay a little, and give me leave to conſider in cool blood, till the heat of
paſſion was over? Had it not been time enough now to have delivered him ſuch a
meſſage as might have coſt him his life? But you were ſo haſty, and all upon the
ſpur, to tell him that which ſhould have been ſeriouſly pondered, and conſidered
upon with grave and ſerious deliberation, and after you had been many times pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
entreated, deſired ſolicited, nay preſſed unto: I beſeech you tell me, Suppoſe
<hi>Sylvander</hi> had dyed upon it; did you think it would have pleaſed me? Nay, could
you think I would not have hated you all the dayes of my life? Oh with what pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and ſolidity theſe offices are to be performed? For could you imagine that
you would not be culpable of all the inconveniences that ſhould enſue upon it? And
were not you worthy to bear all the blame? <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> could not chuſe but
laugh to hear <hi>Phillis</hi> thus charged, and to ſee that ſhe could not anſwer unto it, and
therefore they condemned her to do whatſoever <hi>Diana</hi> deſired of her. I do aſſure
you, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> a very fine Sentence; which yet, in reſpect of my Judges, I will
obey; but unto what puniſhment, I beſeech you, muſt I be condemned? Not ſo
great as your crime, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> I will only, that when you ſee <hi>Sylvander</hi>
next, you ſhall aſſure him, that all which you told unto him was only out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>allary,
and that I did never know any thing concerning it: ſo that he may think all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from your mouth, and that when I do ſpeak next unto him, I may treat him as
I was wont to do, before the trechery of <hi>Laonice.</hi> I do aſſure you Siſter, ſaid <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
I did alwayes think you to be very ſubtle, but never ſo ſubtle as I find you now.
No, no, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> this is no ſubtilty, but prudence; for <hi>Diana</hi> has reaſon to deſire
it, and though you had not committed the fault whereof you are convicted, yet you
ought to do as ſhe ſays. Madam, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> I ſhould be more willing to do
it, were I not obliged unto it; for I am of ſuch an humour, that I had rather give
twenty gifts, then pay one debt.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt they were thus talking, <hi>Sylvander</hi> all ſorrow, and hanging down his head,
came through the wood, till he was juſt upon the place where theſe Shepherdeſſes
were: and by fortune ſo near, that when he ſaw them, and would have turned
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53527:195"/>
back, <hi>Phillis</hi> in obedience to the command upon her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did ſpeak unto him; <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Sylvander,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him, do you remember the time when you put me out
of all patience againſt <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and made it your delight to make him jealous? And
becauſe he anſwered not, ſhe continued; If you do remember, let it be a warning to
you for the future, not to offend a woman, for it will not be long before ſhe be
revenged: and if you will not believe it, let me ſerve you for an example. I do not
know (anſwered <hi>Sylvander</hi> very dejectedly) what you mean: I do mean, replied
<hi>Phillis,</hi> that all the ſtories which I told you concerning <hi>Diana,</hi> and her anger, were
things only invented by my ſelf, to be revenged of you for making <hi>Lycidas</hi> jealous of
me, when he obſerved the familiarity which was then betwixt you and me. How
(ſaid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) <hi>Diana</hi> not know any thing of all that which you told unto me?
Not at all, I aſſure you, anſwered <hi>Phillis. Diana</hi> hearing her ſelf named, and
faigning to be ignorant what the matter was, ſhe went unto them, and addreſſing
her ſelf unto the Shepherd, I heard you name me, (ſaid ſhe unto him) I beſeech
you, what ſhare have I in your diſcourſe? I am ſo confounded (ſaid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) to
hear and to ſee what I do, as I do think my ſelf to be in a dream. <hi>Phillis</hi> then
breaking out into a loud laughter, Siſter, (ſaid ſhe unto her) you muſt know from
me, what this Shepherd does know but in part; upon this, ſhe began to relate the
jealouſie of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> the pains ſhe put upon him, and how <hi>Sylvander</hi> behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
towards her. To be brief, ſaid ſhe, I thought that if I were not revenged, I
ſhould never enjoy any contentment in my life. I knew how <hi>Sylvander</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> and never acquainted you with it: I thought this to be a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
for my revenge; and indeed, ask him how he likes it, and whether he will
take ſo much pains again to vex me any more. But I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> what
ſhare have I in all this buſineſs? You have had what ſhare I pleaſed, anſwered <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis:</hi>
For I made you ſpeak, even what I would, Truly Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I am very
much obliged to you, for making me to ſpeak when I never thought upon you. I
beſeech you Siſter, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> to pardon me, for I muſt needs be revenged. Oh
Heavens! (cryed out <hi>Sylvander,</hi> recoyling a pace or two, and folding his arms
one within another) Oh ye Gods, is it poſſible that <hi>Diana</hi> ſhould have no hand or
knowledg of that meſſage which you told me from her? No, replied <hi>Phillis;</hi> ſhe
knows not one ſillable of it; and that you may ſee I ſay truly, here <hi>Sylvander,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſhe, and gave him the bracelet which ſhe took from him, take this again,
for I am contented with thoſe tears which my theft did coſt you. <hi>Sylvander</hi> kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down upon the ground, he took it and kiſſed it a hundred times: and <hi>Diana</hi> the
better to colour her ſeeming ignorance: Siſter (ſaid ſhe unto her) what is that which
you give him? and what theft do you ſpeak of? Content your ſelf, anſwered <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
that ſince you had no hand in the taking it away, there is no reaſon you ſhould
have any in the reſtitution. <hi>Sylvander</hi> was ſo extreamly joyed in receiving the dear
bracelet, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rgetting all his ſad thoughts, his countenance began to change upon
a ſudden: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> turning unto <hi>Phillis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> I cannot tell, oh my enemy, ſaid he unto her,
whether I ſhould complain againſt you, for the harm you have done me in ſtealing a
thing which I eſteemed ſo infinitely dear; or whether I ſhould think my ſelf obliged
unto you for the favour you have done me in reſtoring it: For I cannot ſay which
is the greater, the diſpleaſure I received, or the contentment which now I have.
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> then began to ſpeak; Truly <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I cannot chuſe but admire at
the cunning piece of revenge which you have taken upon this Shepherd; and I muſt
confeſs, that I never thought you had a ſpirit ſo reſolved upon any ill. Good Siſter,
ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> why ſhould I not prevent this Shepherd from putting any future diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures
upon me? Do you not conſider that impunity gives boldneſs to commit
new offences? <hi>Alexis</hi> who admired the wit of this Shepherdeſs, as well in diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the buſineſs, as inventing the way of it ſo ſuddenly, ſhe concluded that the wit
of any man could not poſſibly be ſo quick at invention, nor ſo ſlie in diſsimulation
as the wit of this woman: and from thence drawing conſequences which ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her to be unqueſtionable. Alas, alas! (ſaid ſhe in her ſelf) unto what a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fate is that lover deſtined, who falls into ſuch hands: but Miſtris, ſaid <hi>Sylvander</hi>
in the mean time, and addreſſed himſelf unto <hi>Diana,</hi> will not you be pleaſed to help
me in taking revenge, ſince ſhe was very near ridding you of the moſt faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53527:196"/>
that ever lived? Shepherd, anſwered ſhe, if you will be adviſed by me, you
ſhall not have any longer thoughts upon revenge, but rather to make her a friend,
ſince you ſee how well ſhe can remember offences: if her memory be as good at
courteſies, as it is at offences, anſwered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſhe may remember that it was I
who compoſed all differences betwixt <hi>Lycidas</hi> and her: and you alſo may remember
that I have done the like for you, anſwered <hi>Phillis:</hi> pray conſider that I could have
kept you a long time in this torment; whereas I contented my ſelf only with two or
three dayes: and you are beholding unto me for no leſs then your life. 'Tis true,
(anſwered <hi>Sylvander</hi> faintly) for I cannot term that a life which I ſhould have lived:
but cruel enemy, did you but conſider what miſeries you have cauſed upon me, I
cannot think you would have thought upon any revenge, but rather have pitied the
poor unfortunate <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who had no hopes of any contentment, but in his
grave. Shepherd, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> you may believe, that for all my revenge, I
ſhould have been very ſorry that any ill accident ſhould have hapned unto you,
eſpecially upon my occaſion. Alas, oh my enemy, replied <hi>Sylvander</hi> ſadly, you are
the occaſion of my greateſt miſery, which is of ſuch a nature that no remedy can
cure. Certainly your miſery muſt be very great, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> if it be beyond
all cure; and yet I will condemn <hi>Phillis</hi> to contribute all her endeavours towards it,
as thinking her obliged thereunto; and not only ſhe, but all us, nay all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
who certainly are all very much concerned in the diſpleaſures of ſo kind a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.
<hi>Phillis</hi> then interrupting <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who would have anſwered unto theſe
obliging expreſſions of <hi>Diana.</hi> No, no Shepherd, ſaid ſhe, hold your peace; all you
can ſay will do more hurt then good unto your diſeaſe: but <hi>Diana,</hi> ſince you think
me obliged to cure the miſeries of this Shepherd, be they of what quality they will,
I will promiſe to cure them, provided alwayes, that you, on your part, will contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
your endeavours alſo. <hi>Diana</hi> ſmiled, and anſwered; you muſt be a very good
Phyſitian, if you cure ſuch deſperate diſeaſes. Let it ſatisfie you, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that
I will do it, ſo he will tell me his diſeaſe. My diſeaſe (anſwered the Shepherd with
tears in his eyes) is incurable by any thing but death. Without your death, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Phillis,</hi> I will cure you, if you have but the courage to tell your diſeaſe, and
<hi>Diana</hi> a will to apply the remedy. When you ſee the greatneſs of it, (replied the
Shepherd) you will be out of all hopes. Is it poſſible (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi>) that ſuch a man
as <hi>Sylvander</hi> ſhould have leſs courage then ſuch a woman as <hi>Phillis?</hi> The courage
which ſhe has, anſwered he, proceeds from her ignorance of that which I do but
know to well. Let the proof, bear witneſſe, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> only tell me your diſeaſe,
for both the Phyſitian, and the Phyſick are ready, Alas, alas! cryed he out, there
is no reſiſting Heaven. This morning being plunged in the abyſſe of ſorrows, which
your diſſimulation cauſed, I went to conſult with the Oracle at <hi>Mount-Verdune,</hi>

heart did ſent into her eyes, which <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> obſerved very well; but ſhe

No, no, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> it is clearly in favour of <hi>Sylvander</hi> if <hi>Diana</hi> will. Either I do

your ſelf the happieſt Shepherd of all <hi>Lignon:</hi> and hearken how the Gods have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
unto you all manner of contentment by this Oracle. As for the firſt verſe,
which tells you that your preſent pain ſhall quickly ceaſe, there needs no better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
then the event which you have already found. As to the ſecond
which ſeems ſuch a fatal ſaying unto you, it is delivered in an ambigious manner, as
moſt Oracles are; the ambiguity reſts in this word, <hi>Marry,</hi> which has a double
ſence, and may be taken two wayes: firſt, we uſually ſay, that a husband does marry
his wife: and ſecondly, we ſay that the <hi>Druide</hi> does marry the husband and the wife;
and it is in this laſt ſence it is to be underſtood, that <hi>Paris</hi> muſt marry <hi>Diana:</hi> he
ſhall become a <hi>Druide</hi> like unto his Father <hi>Adamas,</hi> and it ſhall be he who ſhall marry
you together. But (ſaid <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and ſighed) I muſt not expect the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of my deſires, but in <hi>Sylvander</hi>'s death. Ah thou ignorant Shepherd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

                        </hi> have you not told us a hundred times, that he does dye in himſelf, who

muſt not expect the accompliſhment of your deſires but by the death of <hi>Sylvander;</hi>
that is, by loving <hi>Diana</hi> ſo, as thou ſhalt dye in thy ſelf and become her: <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and

there wants nothing to make good her promiſe, but adding her will. <hi>Diana,</hi> who
perhaps was as well pleaſed with this interpretation, as <hi>Sylvander</hi> could be, though
ſhe made it leſſe appear: do you not ſee (ſaid ſhe) that I am not concerned at all in
the buſineſſe? Nay, nay, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> never deny it, for it is plain that the Oracle

you will? Unleſs you will give the Gods the lie, and unleſs you break your Oath,
you muſt make good all that the Oracle would have you; which is, that you do not
only let <hi>Sylvander</hi> love you, but alſo that you love him, ſo as he may live in you,
and you in him. Ah Siſter! (ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and turned a little the other way) no, no,
ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and took her by the arm, let me hear no more of your ah Siſters, there
is no middle way to be taken; you muſt either be perjured, or do as I ſay; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
there is no recovery of this Shepherd. Siſter (ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> with a becoming bluſh,

and holding down her eyes) what would you have me do? I would have you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Oath, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> which you have ſworn, and promiſed: what did
I promiſe (ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſmiled) you did ſwear, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> to do all that
was neceſſary, to make this Oracle advantagious unto <hi>Sylvander.</hi> 'Tis true, ſaid
<hi>Diana,</hi> and what ought I now to do? You muſt, as I told you before (replied <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>)
love <hi>Sylvander</hi> in ſuch a manner, that he may live in you, and you in him. That
(anſwered ſhe) is above my Oath. No, ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> for amity conſiſts in nothing but
the will: <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you muſt needs give your conſent; Well,
ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> after much importunity, ſince you command me, I will: this will, ſaid
<hi>Phillis,</hi> muſt be a little better explained; and ſay, that I will love <hi>Sylvander</hi> ſo, that
hereafter as he lives in me, I will live in him. Oh Heavens! ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> is not that
too much? Yes, ſaid <hi>Sylvander,</hi> too much for my merit; not for his merit of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> nor to ſatisfie the Oracle. Well, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I will do all that
<hi>Alexis, Aſtrea,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> would have me; but if it be a fault, let it be yours, and
upon the counſel which you give me; ſo be it, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> but furthermore, I do
ordain, that for aſſurance of your words, <hi>Sylvander</hi> by your conſent, do kiſs your
hand, with a proteſtation never to depart from your obedience. <hi>Sylvander</hi> fell down
upon his knees, raviſhed with too much joy, and was ſo ſurpriſed at this unexpected
happineſs, that taking <hi>Dianas</hi> hand and kiſſing it, it was a long time before he could
ſpeak one ſillable; and looked as if his eyes were dazled with too much light: this
inexceſſive joy did almoſt take away from him the uſe of reaſon; but his ſilence and
his raptures had more eloquence in them then he had, and better-ſpoke the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of his affection then his tongue could: and had it not been for <hi>Alexis</hi> and the
Shepherdeſſes who helped him up, he had continued long in this amorous extaſie,
not knowing ſo much as what he did. <hi>Diana</hi> her ſelf was no leſs moved, though ſhe
ſet a better gloſs upon it: but <hi>Phillis,</hi> who obſerved all this; and helped him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover:
come <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſaid ſhee unto him, muſt I be ſtill your enemy? Do you
ſee how fully I can revenge thoſe wrongs that are done unto me? The Shepherd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little returned to himſelf, I muſt needs confeſs <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſaid he unto her, that
you are the ſweeteſt enemy that ever was; and confeſſe alſo, ſaid ſhe, that I have as
much power as the greateſt Gods: for wherein is their power more ſeen, then in the
good and bad fortune which they give? And have not I, when it pleaſed me, made
you the moſt miſerable, and then when it pleaſed me, the moſt happy man upon
earth? What is it that fortune can do more then I? Good fortune and bad fortune,
happineſſe and miſery, have their dependency upon my will. I muſt confeſs, oh
puiſſant Shepherdeſs, ſaid <hi>Sylvander,</hi> that if your power do extend it ſelf over others

deny but that <hi>Sylvander</hi> ought to adore me. If it were permitted amongſt us (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Shepherd and ſmiled) to adore many Gods, <hi>Phillis</hi> ſhould certainly be an
adored Deity unto me: but ſince it is not lawful, and that we muſt acknowledg but
one God, I hope I ſhall be excuſed, if I do not render that devoir. I am very well
contented (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> then) that you do adore but one Deity in Heaven, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon earth: ſo I ſhall, replied the Shepherd, <hi>Tautates</hi> in Heaven, and <hi>Diana</hi>
upon Earth. Oh moſt ungrateful wretch, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> are you not more beholding
unto me, then to <hi>Diana?</hi> Is not all the contentments you receive from my hand?
I ſhould be moſt ungrateful indeed, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> if I did not acknowledg what
is due unto you; but I ſhould be much more ungrateful, did I equal my obligations
I ow unto <hi>Diana,</hi> with thoſe I ow unto you: for thoſe I do ow unto you, are but
conſequents of my love to her; and thoſe which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ow unto her, are no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
nor upon any conſideration but love it ſelf, without any relation to you.
And therefore <hi>Phillis,</hi> undeceive your ſelf in this: all the benefits which you have
done me, I take as coming from her; for otherwiſe I would not eſteem them bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.
I perceive, replied <hi>Phliis,</hi> and ſmiled, that all my labour in obliging you is
but loſt, ſince all my benefits are ſet upon the ſcore of that Shepherdeſs. What
would you have me do? ſaid <hi>Sylvander;</hi> for ſuch is my affection unto <hi>Diana,</hi>
that I give Heaven no thanks for the life it hath given me, unleſſe I may
ſerve and adore this Divine <hi>Diana,</hi> unto whom all humane hearts ought to
render homage.</p>

                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:53527:197"/>
Thus did <hi>Diana</hi> let <hi>Sylvander</hi> know that ſhe loved him; and ever ſince this day
ſhe was not ſhie, nor made any difficulty to live with him, as <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was wont to do
with <hi>Celadon,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> with <hi>Lycidas:</hi> ſo as <hi>Sylvander</hi> has ſince oftentimes ſaid,
that he had never been happy, if he had not been firſt miſerable.</p>
                     <p>The joy and contentment which might be ſeen in the eyes and actions of <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
was ſuch, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> did extreamly admire at it: and the changing
of his complexion and countenance in ſo ſhort a time, was an infallible argument un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them of his real affection. As for the diſguiſed <hi>Druide,</hi> ſhe meaſured the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of <hi>Sylvanders</hi> joy by her own, which ſhe ſhould have received if under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and not of <hi>Alexis, Astrea</hi> had been ſo kind as ſhe was unto her.
But when <hi>Sylvander</hi> obſerved the change of habits between <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> I
muſt confeſs, ſaid he with wonder, that <hi>Phillis</hi> has ſo infatuated my underſtanding,
as till now I never found my miſtake. Oh <hi>Sylvander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> aſſure your ſelf
that a woman can deceive a man a hundred wayes when ſhe has a mind unto it, and
therefore it concerns you to keep my friendſhip very carefully. All the company
did fall to laughing, and they walked along the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> till they came to the
place where <hi>Celadon</hi> did caſt himſelf into the water; which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſeeing, let us flye,
ſaid ſhe, let us flye away from this fatal place, from which me-thinks nothing can
come but diſaſters.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Druide</hi> knew very well that it was the place where ſhe received thoſe cruel
commands, which conſtrained her to turn her ſelf from <hi>Celadon</hi> into <hi>Alexis:</hi> and it
was impoſſible for her, not to give knowledge of ſome reſentment. But not being
able to imagine that this Shepherdeſs ſhould call the place fatal for that cauſe: and
why my dear Servant (ſaid ſhe unto her) do you term this place of <hi>Lignon</hi> fatal?
<hi>Astrea</hi> did not anſwer, but looked upon her, changed colour, and could not chuſe
but ſigh. Which <hi>Diana</hi> perceiving, Madam (ſaid ſhe unto her) <hi>Aſtrea</hi> has good
cauſe to call this place fatall, becauſe ſhe was very near being drowned there: for
ſhe fell into the River, and but for ſome happy help which came in opportunely,
this Country had for ever loſt the faireſt Shepherdeſs that ever lived in it. I pray
tell me (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi>) how chanced that accident? <hi>Phillis,</hi> who was unwilling <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi>
ſhould take any notice of <hi>Aſtreas</hi> diſquiet; Mis-fortunes (ſaid ſhe) and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters
are not to be talked on in a time ſo full of joy as this: but yet, they ſay, ſaid
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> that the memory of paſt miſeries does bring contentment, and are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:
yes, replied <hi>Astrea,</hi> when the miſeries which are related, do not make miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
again: but that for which I give the phraſe of fatal unto this place, does never
come into my memory without infinite grief: and ſee <hi>Sylvander</hi> whether I have not
good reaſon for it; for when I fell from that fatal place into the water, poor <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
deſiring to help me, was drown'd: and ſome curſed reporter carrying the falſe
news of my death unto my Father and my Mother, they both dyed preſently after,
ſo as I had no ſooner bewailed the one, but tears began to overſwel my eyes for the
other. <hi>Aſtreas</hi> eyes could no longer refrain from tears, and certainly they had
flowed into a torrent, had they not heard a Shepherd ſinging, which diverted <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strea,</hi>
and cauſed all the company to look that way: As ſoon as <hi>Diana</hi> had turned
her ſelf, I am, ſaid ſhe, very much miſtaken, if yonder Shepherd whom we ſee, and
the company which is with him, are not coming hither to look for me: what moves
you unto that thought? ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> I will tell you (anſwered ſhe) but let us hear
what he ſings; and they being very near, alſo he ſinging very loud, they heard him
ſing, <hi>That whereſoever he came, he found the repreſentation of him and his Miſtris.</hi>
I am not miſtaken, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> as ſoon as the Shepherd had ſung that verſe, for the
Gods have choſen me to Judge a difference which is amongſt them; yeſterday they
deſired me to undertake the office, and I promiſed them to meet them here at this
place this hour; happy I am that we light ſo opportunely both of the place and the
time, for I ſwear unto you that I had quite forgot it. By that, Miſtris (ſaid <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>)
you may draw aſſurance that it is the will of the Gods you ſhould take that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
upon you, ſince they have ſo opportunely conducted you.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, the ſtrangers were ſo near, that <hi>Diana</hi> out of civility went to ſalute
them; a little after, <hi>Alexis, Aſtrea,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> did the ſame: you may ſee, ſaid
<hi>Diana,</hi> that I am a perſon of my word, and have brought all this good Company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:53527:198"/>
with me, not only out of curioſity to know the cauſe of your coming to me, but to
help me in the judgement which I am to give unto you. We are much aſhamed, fair
and diſcreet Shepherdeſs, replied <hi>Delphire,</hi> that we have made you ſtay ſo long;
and we do find our obligations doubled, ſince we have greater hopes that our cauſe
will receive a more equitable judgment, by the aſſiſtance of your company of which
do not doubt, for all our reſt and tranquility depends upon what you ſhall pleaſe
to ordain amongſt us. But, oh juſt Judge, ſaid <hi>Thomantes,</hi> and interrupted, what
ſhall be done unto thoſe that are condemned, and will not obſerve the Sentence
which you ſhall doom? This queſtion is not moved without reaſon; for I have ſeen
this fair one (pointing at <hi>Delphire</hi>) ſo negligent in the obſervance of thoſe Laws,
which all other humans hold inviolable, as I have good cauſe to fear ſhe will not
obſerve what you ſhall ordain, if it be againſt her mind. Oh <hi>Thomantes!</hi> (ſaid <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire</hi>)
this reproach is inſupportable; and were I not in hopes that ere long our
juſt Judge will revenge all the wrongs which I have received from you, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Juſtice upon this injury in particular. You are ſo accuſtomed (replied <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes</hi>)
to complain without a cauſe, as I do not think it ſtrange you ſhould now
do the like; nor think it a leſſe wonder to hear me ſpeak ſo openly and freely, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all my life behaved my ſelf towards you, under the Laws of ſuch a grand reſpect,
that any complaints were not permitted me in my greateſt pain: but now we are
here before our Judge, and it is fit ſhe ſhould know both your cruelties, and my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that ſhe may the better give judgment upon them. I will not enter or hold
any Diſcourſe with you (ſaid <hi>Delphire</hi>) but will only hint unto our Judge to obſerve
from your language, that it is the higheſt injuſtice to blind Juſtice. Only beſeech
her not to loſe any more time in hearing you, but imploy it upon that which ſhe is
ordained unto by the Gods.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Thomantes</hi> were talking thus, <hi>Diana</hi> ſeated her ſelf upon the
ground, and <hi>Alexis, Aſtrea, Phillis,</hi> and the reſt of the Shepherdeſſes, ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſuch places where they might beſt hear this difference argued: <hi>Filintes,</hi> and
<hi>Aſphales,</hi> with <hi>Sylvander,</hi> did the ſame: Now (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) fair Shepherdeſſe, and
you courteous Shepherd, if you deſire any thing from me, let me underſtand your
demands and difference; and in beſt order thereunto, it is very fit you make choiſe
of one which knows all the paſſages betwixt you, to relate them unto us, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
both parties to ſpeak for themſelves. Fair and Wiſe Shepherdeſſe, ſaid <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phale</hi>
then, we are four Shepherds and two Shepherdeſſes that are intereſted in the
judgment which you are to give, and therefore if you think it good, <hi>Androgenes,</hi>

of <hi>Doriſſea, Androgenes,</hi> and my ſelf: I conceive, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> that
for brevities ſake, it is better that the Shepherdeſſes make the firſt relation, and not
the Shepherds, who know too well to anſwer their reaſons: and therefore <hi>Doriſſea,</hi>
I do appoint you unto the office, not only to relate what concerns <hi>Delphire,</hi> but alſo
what concerns your ſelf, not queſtioning but ſo direct a Shepherdeſſe will give us
true information. Hereupon <hi>Doriſſea,</hi> after a low reverence, took her place, and
after a little time of conſideration, ſhe began thus.</p>

love.</p>
                     <p>Be pleaſed to know then, fair and Wiſe Shepherdeſſe, that <hi>Thomantes</hi> being the
only ſon of his Parents, was brought up with abundance of tender care, by the Wiſe
Shepherdeſs <hi>Ericanthe</hi> his Mother, and by <hi>Eleaman</hi> his Father: ſo tender was their
care over him, that they would never ſuffer him to be out of their preſence, as
thinking that as ſoon as they loſt the ſight of him, he was loſt for ever. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Eleaman</hi> and <hi>Ericanthe</hi> were the wealthieſt in all our Town, as well in the great
abundance of flocks and paſtures, as in the great number of Shepherds and Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes,
unto whoſe charge he committed the care of them, the young <hi>Thomantes</hi>
was brought up in all the qualities and exerciſes fit for a Shepherd of his rank, in
which for his age, he did ſo profit himſelf, that none in all our coaſts could equal
him. Being got out of the hands of his Nurſe, an ancient and Wiſe Paſtor was ſet
over him as his Governour; not that he was thereby excluded from the company of
thoſe women, who waited upon his Mother; for on the contrary he was amongſt
them till the age of ten or twelve years, ſo beloved and careſſed by all, as well were
they that could love him moſt, for beſides his being very amiable, and had all the
good qualities that one of his age could have, he was looked upon as the darling and
delight of the Paſtor <hi>Eleaman,</hi> and of the ſage <hi>Ericanthe</hi> their Miſtris. But as it
commonly happens at that age, rather by inſtinct then by election, to love one above
another, the young <hi>Thomantes</hi> no ſooner ſaw ten years of age, but he ſhewed a
great inclination to love <hi>Delphire,</hi> who was then brought up with <hi>Ericanthe,</hi> and
and not above eight or nine years old at that time. Their innocent age, and their
deſign without deſign, not being yet inſtructed in the art of diſſimulation, every
one took notice of the particular affection of <hi>Thomantes</hi> unto <hi>Delphire;</hi> whereof
<hi>Ericanthe</hi> was very glad, as well becauſe that Shepherdeſſe was indeed very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
and worthy of love and ſervice; as becauſe many do think that there is nothing
does more awake and enliven youth, nor rouſe it up unto noble deſigns, then love:
doing in this the office of Steel, which makes a flint to ſparkle, that is of it ſelf cold,
and without light. One may eaſily imagine what kind of infantine affection this was,
which they bore one to the other, for I am confident none can think it above mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of play for pins, or making preſents of cheries, and telling old tales, that their
Nurſes taught them in the Univerſity of the Nurſerie: but ſo it was, that theſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
beginnings did ſomtimes produce great effects, and love was pleaſed to raiſe by
degrees theſe childiſh inclinations unto great affections: the Shepherd when he was
arrived at his fourteenth year, was able to call himſelf old Lover, it being now five
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53527:199"/>
or ſix yeares ſince he began the profeſſion; and yet all this while he was not ſo good
a proficient as to know that it was love: but afterwards, both of them growing

confirming by their wills what they had done before by hazard, or at leaſt by a

                     <p>The firſt time he took the boldneſs was the day of his birth, which <hi>Ericanthe</hi> in
thanks to the Gods did every year celebrate upon the day that he was born.</p>
                     <p>Not far from the ſourſe of our delightful <hi>Lignon, Bleaman</hi> and <hi>Ericanthe</hi> had a
houſe, which nature had imbelliſhed with all the ornaments that could make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful;
it was ſeated upon a Hill, whoſe proſpect, though a little limited, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſome petty Mountains; yet it was ſo pleaſant, as thoſe that would take a land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip
of delight, might make that their pattern for a ſcituation. <hi>Lignon</hi> ran below it
with its lovely meanders, as far as the ſight could extend; mead<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ws made a moſt
agreable object to the eye: all one ſide of the Hill was covered with a ſhade of trees
quartered in walks, where one might walk and defie the ſcortching heat of the day,
till they came to the River <hi>Lignon:</hi> flowers at all times, and of all colours, do grow
in great abundance; Nightingals making choiſe of it for their conſtant habitation, do
people it in ſuch ſort, and warble it in their anſwers of each other, like a world of
Muſitians, as if they had forſaken all other places of the Country, to come and chant
it there; to be brief, the place was the delight of all the neighbouring Towns, and
commonly had a great concourſe of people in it, eſpecially upon dayes of ſolemnity,
as this birth day of <hi>Thomantes</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems Heaven would let this young Shepherd know, that he had not been
born, but only to live in the ſervice of this fair one; for though he had opportunity
enough to ſpeak unto her, and to let her underſtand his affection, yet he ſtayed till
the day of his birth before he would declare it by word, as if he had ſaid, that the
day whereon ſhe received him for her ſervant, ſhould be the firſt day that he did
rightly begin to live. It fortun'd ſo, that a little before, an Uncle unto <hi>Delphire</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which cauſed her, according to cuſtom, to be in a mourning habit. <hi>Delphire</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an excellent grace in decking and dreſſing her ſelf more handſomly then any of
the young Shepherdeſſes in the Town, ſhe appeared ſo fair and handſom in that
habit of ſorrow, as there was no eye which looked upon her without raviſhment
and admiration, as well at her beauty as her ſweet civilities: and <hi>Thomantes</hi> was not
ſo much an admirer as an adorer, but indeed both; and took ſuch delight in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
her actions, as his eyes had no other objects: he could not ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with commending her; ſomtimes he doted upon her complexion; ſomtimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſymetry and features of her face; ſomtimes upon the vivacity of her eyes;
ſomtimes the coral of her lip; ſomtimes upon the ivory of her teeth; otherwhiles,
he was wholly taken up, with her ſtature, garb, and mind: otherwiles with the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
and whiteneſſe of her hand: otherwhiles in the advantage ſhe had above all her
Companions in her dreſſe: ſo as he concluded that there was nothing under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
ſo fair, nor ſo lovely as <hi>Delphire.</hi> You make me a relation of hiſtory ſo new,
(anſwered ſhe and ſmiled) and ſo incredible, that for my part, I can give no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
unto it. I do know very well (replied he) from whence this incredulity comes;
it is becauſe you cannot ſee your ſelf: for if Heaven had done you that favour, I do
not think you ſuch an enemy to truth, as to ſay I am not in the right. I have ſeen
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53527:199"/>
my ſelf ſeveral times in fountains of water, replied ſhe, and in ſeverall glaſſes: but I
could never find what you out of flattery are pleaſed to tell me. Oh <hi>Delphire,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he, how imperfect are thoſe repreſentations, and what infinite wrong they
do unto your beauty? Do you think thoſe dead and ſenſleſſe things are able to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
you? You I ſay, who are the very life and joy of all thoſe that have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſee you: if you have a mind to ſee your ſelf as you are, be pleaſed to take a
living mirrour of my preſenting unto you; and I aſſure myſelf, that if you will
daign to caſt your eye upon it, you will there find in your ſelf more beauties then
any tongue can tell: what is that, ſaid the Shepherdeſs, which you call a living mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?
My heart, anſwered he. Oh <hi>Thomantes</hi> (ſaid ſhe) how falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
are all ſuch mirrours? For as one cannot ſee in them what one would,
but onely what thoſe deluding mirrours pleaſe to repreſent; ſo there is no
aſſurance or credit to be given to their repreſentations, becauſe they are only
ſuch as the paſſion of the ſoul does bid them. I do believe (anſwered he) that the
heart does repreſent nothing but what is in the ſoul, and therefore you may ſee in
mine, <hi>Delphire</hi> in her perfect beauty, becauſe you are ſo imprinted in my ſoul, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more perfectly repreſented. <hi>Thomantes</hi> (ſaid ſhe) what a lyer you
are, and how you jear me, and would laugh at me, if I had ſo little wit as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you? There is nothing ſo ſhameful to a perſon of honour, anſwered he, as to
be ſurpriſed in a lie: you need not fear that ſhame (replied ſhe) for you know that
none can look into your heart to convince you. Actions (anſwered he) are they
that open the doors of a heart; and you ſee that all mine do teſtifie unto you, how
<hi>Thomantes</hi> does love <hi>Delphire,</hi> and that he does never look with the eyes of love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other beauty but hers; and I do make this declaration unto you upon my birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
to teſtifie that I believe Heaven gave me life only to imploy it in loving and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
you; which I do vow to do, with ſo much affection and fidelity, that I am
forced to call my ſelf your moſt devoted ſervant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thomantes</hi> added unto theſe many other expreſſions, which (for brevities ſake)
I omit, and which <hi>Delphire</hi> did not interrupt; becauſe, though ſhe had a quick wit,
and ſound judgment, yet was ſhe ſo ſurpriſed, that ſhe could not anſwer: for the
reſpect which ſhe bore unto him as the Son of <hi>Ericanthe,</hi> the good will which ſhe
already had unto him as <hi>Thomantes,</hi> the virtues and affections which ſhe found in
him, and her fears to fail in her duty, did hold her in a ſuſpenſe of reſolution, and
therefore <hi>Thomantes,</hi> after a while of ſilence in expectation of her anſwer, and when
he ſaw ſhe remained ſtill mute, he continued thus: I perceive, faireſt <hi>Delphire,</hi> that
your ſilence does menace me; and that thoſe hopes which the ſweetneſſe of your
eye does promiſe me, are not very certain: but on the contrary the augure which I
might take from that black habit which you wear, does but too truly portend my
ruine. Upon this, he changed colour, and his words did die in his mouth; and
though he did offer ſeveral times to fall again into his diſcourſe, yet he was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
at her returning no anſwer, that he could not ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Delphire</hi> then, to eaſe him from any longer pain, ſhe ſaid unto him: The words
<hi>Thomantes</hi> which I heard you utter, are very like unto thoſe which moſt Shepherds
do commonly uſe unto Shepherdeſſes; and I will believe they were ſpoken more out
of cuſtom, then with any deſign: yet the reſpect which I do ow unto you, and the
honour which you do me in diſcourſing with me, does oblige me to eſteem them, as
coming from ſo kind a Shepherd, whom I will alwayes eſteem and honour as I ought,
and as he deſerves: and becauſe ſhe would not have this diſcourſe continue any
longer, or go any further at this time, ſhe went away unto her Companions.</p>
                     <p>Be, oh ſage Shepherdeſſe, pleaſed to know, that a long time before, <hi>Filintes</hi>
who is that Shepherd whom you ſee next unto <hi>Delphire,</hi> and who is a near kinſman
unto <hi>Thomantes,</hi> was become a ſervant unto that ſame Shepherdeſs, and being old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then he, he had alſo more boldneſs to declare himſelf ſo. But ſome urgent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
conſtraining him to leave our Town, and to take a long voyage; it ſeems Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
would favour the deſign of <hi>Thomantes,</hi> in taking from him this rival, who was
no ſmal mote in his eye.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Filintes</hi> then departed, full of love and full of ſorrow, and about twelve or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
months after, returned with the ſame love he carried away, unleſs perhaps en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53527:200"/>
and grown bigger as his body was. But at his departure he had an opinion
that he had ſome advantage of <hi>Thomantes,</hi> yet found at his return, what a mortal
enemy abſence is unto Love: for he found the deſign of his rival ſo thriven, and his
own ſo blaſted, as any but himſelf, would have loſt all hopes. Yet his generous
courage would not ſhrink at any difficulties, and therefore reſolved a ſecond defeat:
at his return then, he renewed his addreſſes; added new ſupplications to his old
prayers; and ſeconded his old ſervices with new ones. Briefly, he was ſo aſſiduous,
and did ſo importune her, that though he could not win any thing upon the reſolved
mind of <hi>Delphire,</hi> yet he raiſed moſt extream ſuſpitions and ſtrong jealouſies in the
ſoul of <hi>Thomantes.</hi> For though <hi>Delphire</hi> did prefer <hi>Thomantes,</hi> yet the true love of
that Shepherd, would not let him be in reſt, knowing very well, that love works
wonders, and does miracles. And from hence did proceed ſo many diſquiets,
and ſo many torments, which theſe two Shepherds have cauſed unto each
other.</p>
                     <p>And yet, although their loves were very great, and the violence of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
did daily increaſe; yet for all this, the friendſhip and amity that was betwixt
them did not alter: a quality which was highly eſtimable in <hi>Filintes,</hi> who was leaſt
loved; and whoſe humour was naturally ſplenetique: and yet who could ſubmit
himſelf unto the laws of reaſon. The advantage of <hi>Thomantes</hi> was great, having the
authority of <hi>Eleaman,</hi> and principally of <hi>Ericanthe,</hi> to back him: and yet the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of <hi>Filintes</hi> was not a little, having a ſiſter, brought up alſo with <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthe,</hi>
who had a very great prevalency with <hi>Delphire:</hi> and indeed, it was unto
her, to whom <hi>Filintes</hi> did commonly make his complaints. At laſt it fell out, that
this Shepherd, after he had obſerved upon ſeveral occaſions how this Shepherdeſſe
preferred <hi>Thomantes</hi> before him, and after he had made all the complaints he could,
ſeeing that he received nothing but freſh teſtimonies of his being not loved, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of all hope and patience, he reſolved to make a retreat, and draw off from
a ſiege which would diſgrace him if continued. So ſeeking for an opportunity of
ſpeaking to her; at laſt finding her in a place where none could hear, he gave her this
language: You know <hi>Delphire</hi> how I have loved you; and I ſay you know it, for your
excellent and pregnant wit cannot chuſe but clearly ſee it in all my actions, ever
ſince you can remember me: you know alſo, that coldneſſe, nor your diſdains, nor
my too long abſence, could ever divert my affection, nor in the leaſt degree diminiſh
it. But now being preſſed, or rather oppreſſed by thoſe ſcorns and injuries which I
daily receive from you, I come to tell you, that finding them inſupportable, I muſt
quit the name of ſervant unto <hi>Delphire,</hi> and that which neither any time nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
nor your rigours could do, your ſcorn, which is inſupportable to my ſpirit,
does move me unto a juſt ſpleen. <hi>Delphire</hi> without the leaſt diſquiet, and almoſt
glad of this his reſolution, did anſwer him extream careleſly; I never thought, nor
deſired, <hi>Filintes,</hi> that you had any mind unto that Title which now you quit; and it
is a thing ſo very indifferent unto me, that if you think there is any one amongſt my
Companions, that deſerves it, I ſhall adviſe you to love and ſerve her.</p>
                     <p>This cold anſwer, and the careleſſe manner of giving it, did ſtill more offend the
courage of <hi>Filintes,</hi> and this was the reaſon why he went away with a lowring brow,
which ſufficiently ſhewed his ill ſatisfaction. But ſpleen, being a paſſion which
blinds the judgement, he thought that no way was better to be revenged upon <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire,</hi>
then to divert the affection of <hi>Thomantes</hi> from her. And as ſome do hope to
accompliſh all they deſire, and imagine all things ſeaſible will come to paſs, ſo he
had a conceipt, that he could perſwade him to withdraw. In order to this deſign
he went unto him; and after he had taken him aſide, Brother, (ſaid he unto him,
for ſo <hi>Eleaman</hi> would have them call each other, though they were only Coſens) I
come to entreat a favour from you, you ought not to deny me, becauſe I ask it out of
the abundance of my affection, and becauſe it is as much to your advantage as mine.
Brother, anſwered <hi>Thomantes,</hi> you may well think that any thing which will give you
contentment, I will certainly do with as good a will as you can deſire it. Then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
me, ſaid <hi>Filintes,</hi> that you will do it; for unleſs you be obliged by your promiſe,
you will at the firſt ſtart back, and make ſome difficulty. I will not promiſe any
thing, replied <hi>Thomantes,</hi> till I know what it is; and you need not fear that any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53527:200"/>
can make me ſtart from doing all I can to give you contentment. A long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
being betwixt them hereupon; at laſt, <hi>Filintes,</hi> ſeeing he could not oblige him
by his promiſe, he reſolved to tell him what the buſineſſe was; Brother, ſaid he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, I deſire you, as the greateſt obligation you can put upon me, that you
would quit <hi>Delphire,</hi> or at leaſt ſeem as if you did for a time; pride has huffed her
into ſo much inſolence, as if ſhe continue a little longer, ſhe will render her ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable;
ſhe thinks all men in the world were made only for her: does ſhe not
pretend that all thoſe reſpects and devoirs, which you and I out of our free wills do
render unto her, are due by obligation? And does ſhe not demand them as a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
to draw all thoſe ſhe ſees, after our example, into her poſſeſſion? She try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umps,
and is become all ſcorn, both towards you and towards me: yet would I
gladly know upon what ground ſhe does it. But Brother, aſſure your ſelf, the more
ſhe ſees we withdraw from her, the neerer ſhe will draw to us; it is good to love,
but not to be ſlaves: I have heard ſay, that women do alwayes make much of men,
till they be aſſured they love them; but then they treat them no better then ſlaves:
come, come, Brother, oblige me ſo far as to retire, as I am reſolved to do; and you
ſhall ſee her with all her ſcorn, and indifferency, brought a loop lower. <hi>Thomantes</hi>
in a ſmiling manner, Brother, ſaid he unto him, I am ſorry you ſhould ask me a thing
which is impoſſible. For I do deſire as much as I do my own life, to give you all
full contentment; but aſſure your ſelf <hi>Filintes,</hi> that let <hi>Delphire</hi> treat me which way
ſhe pleaſeth, I can do no other but endure it without murmur: I have no power to
withdraw my ſelf from that ſervitude in which ſhe holds me: and for my part, I do
think, all that ſee her, are in reaſon obliged to ſerve and adore her: for judging
others by my ſelf, I think it to be a great deffect in judgment, not to end their dayes
in ſuch a ſweet ſervitude. Fie, fie, <hi>Thomantes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Filintes,</hi> are you not aſhamed of
ſuch an unworthy reſolution? Good Brother; anſwered <hi>Thomantes,</hi> the ſtone is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
thrown, there is no recalling it, I am ſo reſolved upon it, that if I ſhould find in my
ſelf the leaſt will to the contrary, I ſhould die with ſhame: but <hi>Filintes,</hi> ſaid he,
pray tell me, what is your deſign? To live, ſaid he, like a man of ſpirit and courage,
and not a ſlave: I can endure any thing but ſcorn; but that, I muſt confeſs, is intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
unto me. Perhaps, ſaid <hi>Thomantes,</hi> when I am more wiſe, I ſhall take up the
ſame reſolution; but as I am, there is no hopes of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus ended the diſcours betwixt theſe two Shepherds; but the event will make
you laugh: <hi>Filintes,</hi> ſeeing he could not divert <hi>Thomantes</hi> from his reſolution, as if
he had quite forgot all that he had ſaid unto him, or unto <hi>Delphire,</hi> he ran as faſt as
ever he could unto her, and beſeeched her with all manner of prayers and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to forget and forgive all that he had ſaid; and then he addreſſed himſelf unto
his Siſter to intercide for him and make his peace: <hi>Delphire</hi> could not chuſe but
ſmile; well, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Filintes</hi> I am contented; upon condition that you will
not believe, you have obliged me more by your return, then by your going
away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Delphire</hi> had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but <hi>Thomantes</hi> entred, who ſeeing this reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and hearing what <hi>Filintes</hi> ſaid, was ſo amazed that he asked <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintes,</hi>
whether what he ſaw was not a dream: no, no, ſaid <hi>Filintes,</hi> it is real; but
imagine that I do as ſlaves uſe, who endeavour to break their chains but cannot. But
when <hi>Thomantes</hi> did relate unto <hi>Delphire</hi> in private, the requeſt which <hi>Filintes</hi> made
unto him, you may imagine whether that Shepherdeſſe was not raviſhed at two ſuch
ſuddain, and ſuch different motions.</p>
                     <p>During the time that theſe two Shepherds lived thus, I returned from the banks
of <hi>Argent,</hi> a little <hi>Rivolet,</hi> which runs into the great River of <hi>Loire:</hi> and at the
ſame time <hi>Aſphales,</hi> (the Shepherd whom you ſee with <hi>Filintes,</hi> and his younger
Brother) took up an humour of courting me, rather I believe, becauſe it ſhould
not be ſaid, that he was the only one in all our Town who did not love, then for any
other end. Now <hi>Aſphales</hi> being almoſt alwayes in the company of his Brother <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintes,</hi>
as his friend, or perhaps as well wiſher unto <hi>Delphire;</hi> we were almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
together. I obſerved that <hi>Aſphales</hi> was long before he could bring himſelf to
any certainty, and knew not upon which of my Companions he ſhould beſtow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
imitating a Bee which flyes upon ſeveral flowers before ſhe fixes upon any: for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53527:201"/>
ſomtimes he would be for <hi>Delphire,</hi> another time upon <hi>Filiſe,</hi> one while upon <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trea,</hi>
and another upon me: But at laſt, after he had turned and returned, ſomtimes
to one, and ſomtimes to another, he fixed upon me, or at leaſt ſeemed ſo.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſs, that if I had been in a mind to entertain any, <hi>Aſphales</hi> had not
been diſagreeable to me; for though he be preſent, yet I muſt needs ſay, that it was
hard to meet with a Shepherd of more taking qualities then he was owner of; agile
in all manner of exerciſes, handſome in his habit, quick and nimble in his diſcourſe,
kind towards Shepherdeſſes, civil towards Shepherds, affable with his familiars, and
ſo complaiſant towards all, as it was impoſſible to be weary of his company: and
withal (interrupted he) one that of all the company <hi>Doriſſea</hi> loves leaſt. <hi>Doriſſea</hi>
(anſwered ſhe and ſmiled) is not reſolved to love all that are amiable. Then conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
her diſcourſe; Now this Shepherd (ſaid ſhe) though I told him freely my
mind, and that he ought not to ſpend his time about a buſineſs from which he could
expect no contentment, yet he ſtill continued obſtinate, and hoped, that time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
which overcomes all things, might in the end melt my reſolution, and alter my
Will; He neglected no opportunities of teſtifying his extream affection unto me:
and becauſe I was at all hours in <hi>Ericanthes</hi> houſe, out of my amity to <hi>Delphire,</hi> he
was at all hours alſo talking to me: for being Nephew unto the ſage Paſtor <hi>Eleaman,</hi>
he never ſtirred out of the houſe, but was continually there, in as much freedom as
in his own; ſo as I had been deaf, if I had not heard him ſay an hundred times in a day
that he loved me; and that he deſired no greater happineſs in the world, then that
I would love him: his conſtant continuance of this, made me think that indeed he
did love me: And this opinion obtained ſo much from him againſt my reſolution, to
permit his continuance; but ſtill after ſuch a reſerved manner, as he could not be
contented with it: He ſaid, that this permitting him to love me, did as good as ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
nothing, and would never oblige me to love him again: I told him, that this
was all I could permit; only that he ſhould keep his affection to me ſo ſecret, and
eſpecially this permiſſion which I gave him, that if any came to know it, I would hold
it for revoked: That he ſhould never deſire any thing from me, which might in the
leaſt manner offend my honour; and above all, that I ſhould not be troubled with
any letters from him; and many other ſuch like articles, unto which he conſented,
knowing, (as I think) that the refuſal of them would rather prejudice then advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
him. But of all theſe, none went ſo much againſt the grain as the laſt, which
exempted me from receiving any letters; for (ſaid he) if it ſhould be my misfortune
to be at a diſtance from you, how ſhould I know how to let you know how I do, or
you me? Very well, anſwered I; for ſuppoſe I ſhould receive your letters, can you
hope or think that would ſend you mine? So that as to that point, the Letters
which I receive will not avail you any thing, and as for hearing from you, truly I am
ſo little inquiſitive, that the labour would be but loſt in ſending them to me.</p>
                     <p>But replied he, do you not value the contentment that I ſhould receive in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
correſpondency with you in this manner? and in rendring you an accompt of
my life? I ſhall know all this, ſaid I, at your return. But in the mean time, ſaid he;
in the mean time, anſwered I, I will be contented to know you love me ſtill, as you
have promiſed: for have you not told me that your life ſhould be alwayes ſuch as I
pleaſed? What then, replied he, muſt I never hope that you will write unto me?
No, ſaid I, and more then that, never hope that I will receive any Letters from you.
This ſeverity, replied he, is too great, and I proteſt, ſaid he, half angry, that do
what you can, I will ſend you ſome Letters: and I proteſt, ſaid I, that I will never
look in them.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why he was ſo earneſt in this, was becauſe he knew that ere long he
was to be abſent from me: for his Father was to ſend him upon ſome important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
into the Province of the Romans. And indeed within a few dayes after, he
came unto me the ſaddeſt foul that ever was ſeen, and looked like a priſoner going to
be hanged. <hi>Doriſſea,</hi> (ſaid he unto me, as ſoon as he could ſpeak unheard by any) ah
<hi>Doriſſea!</hi> this is the laſt day I have to live, unleſſe you have ſome pity upon <hi>Aſphales:</hi>
I ſeeing his face ſo changed, and his colour quite gone, I muſt confeſſe, I had ſome
apprehenſions of ſome harm he would do himſelf, and was ſo kind as to reſent his
ſadneſs: but when I asked him, why he ſpoke ſo? and underſtood that it was only
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53527:201"/>
the journey which he was to take, I could not chuſe but ſmile. Do you laugh,
ſaid he, at that which my heart weeps? Oh moſt cruel woman! if Heaven do not
revenge me upon you, I ſhall not think it juſt. I do not laugh at your journey, ſaid
I unto him, for ſince it diſpleaſeth you, it ſhall not be pleaſing unto me; but I
laugh at the diſpute which we had ſome few dayes ſince, becauſe it ſeems you fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
your departure: could I hope, anſwered he, that you would never be pleaſed
at any thing which diſpleaſeth me, I ſhould depart the moſt happy man, that ever
was conſtrained to be abſent from her whom he adores. If you underſtand my
words aright (ſaid I) you may go with aſſurance that what diſpleaſeth you, ſhall
not be pleaſing unto me; and how, ſaid he, would you have me underſtand them?
My meaning is, replied I, that whatſoever diſpleaſeth you, ſo I have no intereſt in it,
but only for the love of you, ſhall never pleaſe me. Then, continued he, becauſe you
have no intereſt in my departure, and becauſe it diſpleaſeth me, you are alſo ſorry
for it: would you <hi>Aſphales,</hi> ſaid I unto him, and ſmiled, that I ſhould conclude as
you do? I cannot tell what I would have, anſwered he dejectedly, unleſs it be
death, ſince you will not ſuffer me to write unto you in my abſence.</p>
                     <p>At the leaſt I am ſure, replied I, that I will not receive any of your Letters. Are
you ſtill in that obſtinate humour? (ſaid he half angry) and making a ſign unto
him by nodding my head, that it was ſo. Then I ſwear, ſaid he, by the affection
which I bear unto you, that you ſhall receive them in ſpite of your teeth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I aſſured him, no, we laid a wager of it, which he ſaid he was ſure to win.</p>
                     <p>Our diſcourſe had continued long upon this ſubject, and had continued longer, if
his Father, who intended he ſhould depart the next morning betimes, had not ſent
two or three times for him: he went then to his Father, from whom he received all
inſtructions neceſſary for his voyage: and when he was ready to depart, he called
to him an old Shepherd, who had ſerved him from his infancy: the Shepherds name
was <hi>Alindre,</hi> a diſcreet and ſubtle man, and one who loved <hi>Aſphales</hi> exceedingly:
<hi>Aſphales</hi> took him into his chamber, and the door being ſhut, he acquainted him
with his affection unto me, with his ſorrows to depart from me, and the extream
contentment it would be to write unto me; and becauſe it was a buſineſs which he
deſired ſhould be kept ſecret, he had made choiſe of him amongſt all the reſt of his
friends, to do him the office of delivering his Letters. <hi>Alindre</hi> who deſired nothing
more then to pleaſe <hi>Aſphale</hi> in all things, did tell him that in this and all other
his commands, neither his affection nor fidelity ſhould fail: <hi>Aſphale</hi> upon this
embracing him; dear friend, ſaid he unto him, I ever had that belief in you; and
therefore, as the thing, which of all the world is moſt dear unto me; I put this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your hands, conjuring you to find a way as ſoon as I am gone, that ſhe may ſee
this letter: and be ſure, you uſe all your ingenuity and care in the delivery of it.
The difficulty (anſwered <hi>Alindre</hi>) will not be great; for being ſo familiar with <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman</hi>
as I am, I can watch my time when ſhe goes to ſee <hi>Delphire,</hi> whom they ſay
ſhe loves extreamly, and ten to one but once in a day I ſhall find a fit opportunity
to give it unto her: Oh friend (ſaid <hi>Aſphales</hi>) do you think ſhe will receive it ſo?
No, no, friend, I would have her take it and read it, before ſhe knows that it comes
from me, otherwiſe ſhe is of ſo croſſe a humour, that ſhe will not take it; for ſhe
has proteſted and ſworn that ſhe would not: and becauſe I do infinitely deſire to
ſhew her that my affection has more induſtry and ingenuity to arrive at my deſires,
then ſhe has cruelty to hinder me; I do conjure you, my dear friend <hi>Alindres,</hi> to uſe
all the wit and ingenuity you have in this buſineſs; I know you have wit enough,
and I know you love me, ſo as if you will but make it your ſtudied buſineſſe, ſhe is not
able to defend her ſelf againſt your ſtratagems.</p>
                     <p>To be brief, fair Shepherdeſs, <hi>Alindres</hi> took upon him the charge of two Letters,
and promiſed that ſince it was a buſineſs which he deſired with ſo much paſſion, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
either one or both of them ſhould be read by that cruel hearted woman.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſphales</hi> departed with this aſſurance; and <hi>Alindres</hi> in the interim more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to keep his promiſe then perhaps <hi>Aſphales</hi> was; after he had long conſulted
with himſelf upon the matter, he reſolved upon this ſlight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eritrea,</hi> who was a very wiſe and diſcreet Shepherdeſs, and in ſome ſort my kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
did make it her particular profeſſion to love me above all others in the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53527:202"/>
Town; <hi>Alindres</hi> who knew very well what good wil this woman bore unto me, and
that though ſhe had a very good wit, yet ſhe never imployed it in ſuch trifles as are
commonly uſed upon ſuch occaſions, he caſt his eye upon her, and deſigned to make
her give me the firſt Letter; and the rather, becauſe he had a great familiarity with
her long before. He went to ſee her therefore, ſeveral times, and talked with her
upon every thing, but only that ſubject which chiefly brought him to her houſe: at
laſt, he turned and winded his anſwers and queſtions ſo, that he made her ſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
and ask of <hi>Aſphales:</hi> Ah me (ſaid he, and ſeemed as if he had forgot to tell
her ſomthing) my memory it ſeems is admirable good, for I came hither purpoſely
upon a buſineſſe which I had quite forgotten, if you had not put me into remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of it by naming <hi>Aſphales.</hi> Then ſhe preſſing him to tel her what it was, he
began to whiſper as if it were a buſineſſe of confidence and truſt, and ſaid thus unto
her; you know <hi>Eritrea</hi> that I am a ſervant unto <hi>Aſphales,</hi> and ſhould be very ſorry
either to do or ſay any thing that might diſpleaſe him: but in this which I would have
you to know, I think I do not any thing againſt his ſervice; nay on the contrary, I
am confident that when his Spirit is free from that paſſion which now poſſeſſes him,
he will thank me as for the beſt piece of ſervice I could do him: and therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, and conjure you to keep it extreamly ſecret, until he be grown wiſer
then now he is. And <hi>Eritrea</hi> having promiſed, and ſworn that ſhe would, I believe
(continued the ſubtle <hi>Alindres</hi>) you are not ignorant of the extream affection which
he bears unto <hi>Doriſea,</hi> for it is ſo apparent, that any who have eyes may ſee it. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritrea</hi>
upon this ſhrugged her ſhoulders, and ſeemed to be very ſorry for it; and
then he, continued, God only knows what Lectures I have read unto him about it,
and how often I have hinted unto him the inconveniences and ſorrows that would
enſue upon it, as wel in relation to <hi>Doriſſea,</hi> whom if he love as he ſayes he does, he
ought to have ſome care of her honour and reputation; as alſo in relation to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
it would be unto <hi>Doriſſeas</hi> kindred, in which <hi>Aſphales</hi> own Father wil have a
ſhare in reſpect of the ancient amity that has been betwixt their two Families: but
all theſe arguments and remonſtrances were light, and ſerved to no uſe but to make
him more cloſe and retired from me ever ſince, then from any other: and I to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
him ſeem to take no notice of it, but keeps my ſelf out of his way as much as
poſſibly I can. Now at his departure, he was not contented to ſpeak his mind unto
<hi>Doriſſea,</hi> for I know he was with her two hours together, before he went; but alſo
hath writ Letters unto her, and left them in the hands of a Shepherd whom I know
very wel, who promiſed to give them unto her; but this careleſs and ill adviſed
Shepherd, in lieu of performing his promiſe. I mean giving them unto <hi>Doriſſea,</hi> or
burning them, or at the leaſt keeping them ſecret, he left them looſly lying upon
his table; and yeſterday as I went to ſee him, upon buſineſs which I had with him,
I ſaw them lying upon the back of his chimney, where trivial Letters uſe to be
thrown, and God knows who ſaw them as well as I: Now knowing what affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you had unto <hi>Doriſſea,</hi> what relation of kindred there was betwixt you, I
thought good to acquaint you, to the end you might uſe ſome means to get them
out of his hands and burn them: for I am confident the diſcretion wherewith they
were writ was no more then that wherewith they were kept: and I believe that if
they could be ſeen, there would be ſomething found which concerns the reputation
of this wiſe woman who is in no fault.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eritrea</hi> who hearkned very attentively unto this Shepherd, who was more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
then her ſelf: Oh <hi>Alindres,</hi> (ſaid ſhe and ſhoak him by the hand) I am exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
obliged unto you for your care of <hi>Doriſſea:</hi> ſhe is indeed the beſt friend I have,
and I dare ſwear ſhe is innocent in this buſineſs: but all this is nothing unleſs you
tell me more, and help me to get theſe Letters out of that Shepherds hands; The
Shepherd, ſaid he, you know very well, his name is <hi>Atis,</hi> he who has the whole
management of <hi>Aſphales</hi> affairs; but I dare not venture to take them: for if ever
this lover ſhould come to know it, he would never pardon the theft. Then pauſing
a while, he continued: yet I have a Son who has wit enough, and may do it if he
will; for being but a boy, leſs notice will be taken of him then of me; and though
he ſhould be ſeen when he takes them, they would not ſuſpect it out of any deſign:
and if you will, I will ſet him a work: <hi>Eritrea</hi> who longed extreamly to have it done,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53527:202"/>
Oh good <hi>Alindres,</hi> ſaid ſhe, let it be done withal expepedition, leſt ſome ſhould be
before you; and I aſſure you <hi>Doriſſea</hi> and I will not be ungrateful: How, ſaid the
crafty <hi>Alindres,</hi> I beſeech you <hi>Eritrea,</hi> let not me be ſo much as named in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
for if <hi>Aſphales</hi> ſhould ever come to know it, he would never look upon me
again with a good eye: Wel, replied ſhe, I wil not tel her, but wil ſatisfie the debt
my ſelf. <hi>Alindres</hi> who had already inſtructed his Son in the buſineſs, who though
young, yet was his Fathers own Son in ſubtilty; he ſent for him immediately, and in
the preſence of <hi>Eritrea</hi> asked him, whether he had ſo much courage as to take the
Letters which lay in the chimney of <hi>Atis,</hi> ſo ſlily as none ſhould perceive him. Yes,
ſaid he, or any thing you command me: go then, ſaid the Father, and if you be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the fact, be ſure you do not ſay that I commanded you. Upon this the boy
offered to go, but <hi>Eritrea</hi> called him back, to promiſe him ſomething in caſe he
brought them, purpoſely to encourage him the more; but he anſwered, no <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trea,</hi>
I had rather die then play the theft upon any conſideration then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of my Father: then he ſeemed to go about his buſineſſe; but his Father ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him one of the Letters before; it was not long before he returned, but
yet meaſured his time juſt according to the diſtance of places: Father (ſaid he, and
gave him the Letter) if there had been a dozen more I could have brought them al,
but I found only this: and what is become of the other? ſaid the Father, I know
not, anſwered the boy, perhaps ſome took it away: tel me truly, ſaid the Father,
did you not want courage to take it? If you wil pardon me, ſaid the boy, I wil tel
you truly; and when the promiſe was made, when I came firſt into the chamber,
ſaid he, I found none in it, but as ſoon as I had taken one Letter, I put it in my hat,
and was reaching at the other, one came into the room, took it from me, and threw
it into the fire. <hi>Eritrea</hi> then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to excuſe him, It is no matter my little friend, ſaid ſhe,
ſince it is burned, I am as well contented as if you had brought it. Oh Shepherd,
ſaid ſhe, I am infinitely joyed the buſineſs has thriven thus well, and that none has
ſeen theſe Letters. And becauſe <hi>Alindres</hi> ſaw ſhe was impatient til ſhe was alone,
he bad her adieu, gave her the Letter, and conjured ſilence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alindres</hi> was no ſooner out of her houſe, but ſhe came to mine; as fortune was,
the houſe was ful of ſtrangers, who came to ſee my Father, and therefore ſhe knew
not how to give me this Letter, nor acquaint me with the good office which ſhe had
done for me; but I obſerved that ſomthing did diſquiet her mind, though could
not imagine what it was: at laſt, I went to her, and took my opportunity to ask
her if ſhe had any news to tell me? I am infinitely deſirous, ſaid ſhe, to talk
with you, and it concerns you, that it be as ſoon as conveniently you can. You may
well think (ſage Shepherdeſſe) that this was enough to ſwell me with curioſity.
I rid my ſelf therefore as ſoon as I could conveniently from all the Company, and
carried her into a cloſet; and I had no ſooner ſhut the door, but ſhe ſaid unto me,
ah my dear Coſen, how careful have I been to recover this paper, out of a place
where it could not be any advantage to you; upon this, ſhe gave me the Letter, and
ſaid unto me, here dear Coſen, read it, and when you have done, I will tell you the
whole ſtory. I who had never ſeen the hand of <hi>Aſphales,</hi> could not know the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
nor ever had the leaſt thought of the wager which I had laid with him; and
to tell you truly, I never believed that this young Spirit would ever have thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: I opened it therefore, not imagining what it was, and found in it theſe words.</p>

I am not able to expreſſe (oh Fair and Wiſe Shepherdeſſe) my amazement at
the reading of this Letter, which by mentioning the Wager, made me know from
whence it came. Believe it, my aſtoniſhment was extream, and I believe <hi>Eritreas</hi> was
no leſſe, when imbracing her I cryed out, oh my Coſen! what have you done? He
who gave this Letter unto you was too ſubtle and crafty for us: How? How? (ſaid
ſhe and went back a pace) what ſubtilty and craft do you mean? for I proteſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
I never took more care nor pains in my life, then in getting them out of the
hands of thoſe who had them; and then not giving me leiſure to ſpeak: nay, nay,
ſaid ſhe, I am in very good earneſt; aſſure your ſelf there was need of craft and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
to get it out of the place where it was; and continuing her Diſcourſe, ſhe told
all the whole ſtory of what ſhe had done, ſo freely and innocently, that I could not
chuſe but laugh heartily: at which ſhe began to be half angry, thinking I did her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of wrong in not believing her; and becauſe I knew that it was out of her
good will unto me, Coſen (ſaid I unto her) I am much obliged unto you for the
pains which you have taken: but aſſure your ſelf, that if I have offended you, <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phales</hi>
ought to make you ſatisfaction: for you have helped him to win a Wager
which he had laid with me; and then I told her the whole paſſage, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made her underſtand the ſubtilty of <hi>Alindres;</hi> at which ſhe was ſo ſurpriſed, that
the poor woman could not ſufficiently admire the treachery.</p>
                     <p>I have told you theſe things, Fair and Wiſe Shepherdeſſe, to let you underſtand
how <hi>Aſphales, Thomantes,</hi> and <hi>Filintes,</hi> behaved themſelves towards <hi>Delphire</hi> and
me; and upon what grounds we might pretend that they ought not to engage
themſelves any where elſe, and yet, be pleaſed to hear what hapned afterwards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thomantes,</hi> had ingratiated himſelf ſo far into my Companions favour, that his
rival had good reaſon to think him better looked then upon himſelf Yet <hi>Delphire,</hi>
who could not any way approve of theſe ſplenatique paſſions in <hi>Filintes,</hi> ſhe would
ſomtimes be jeſting and laughing with him. During which time, the ſixth day of the
month came on; a day as you know, dedicated to the gathering of the Miſleto:
and by fortune thoſe that went to ſeek it in our Sacred Groves, did find it in that
part which was neareſt our Town: this was the reaſon, that not only we, but all our
neighbours came to rejoyce with us, and to congratulate our good fortune: for into
what place ſoever Heaven ſent this Sacred Miſleto, it brought with it alwayes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of proſperity.</p>
                     <p>Every one therefore prepared themſelves, according to the cuſtom, to honour
the day; and to perform thoſe exerciſes which were intended; as running, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
throwing the bar, and ſhooting: the young Shepherds ſpruced up themſelves
in all their gaiety and gallantry: <hi>Filintes</hi> deſiring to be very fine, he begged a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of <hi>Delphire,</hi> which ſhe denied with the beſt excuſes ſhe could find: but he, who
was bold enough, and thought that the greateſt pleaſure in love was, as in hunting,
to take what one purſues by force, he put his hand about the Shepherdeſſes neck,
and took out of her head a flower made of ſilk, which the Siſter of that Shepherd
had pinned there. <hi>Delphire,</hi> who thought it better to let him take it thus before all
the company, then in private, after two or three times asking: well, ſaid ſhe, what
the ſiſter gave me, the Brother takes from me, but <hi>Filintes</hi> went away unto his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
to get it faſtned to his hat; it chanced that <hi>Thomantes</hi> was there; who knowing
the flower, and thinking that <hi>Delphire</hi> had beſtowed it upon him with her free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
he fell into ſuch a jealouſie, that a fever ſeiſed upon him, and that in ſo violent
a degree, that it conſtrained him to keep his bed.</p>
                     <p>This ſudden ſickneſſe ſet the ſage Shepherdeſſe <hi>Ericanthe</hi> off the humour of any
rejoycing, ſo as the bravery of <hi>Filintes</hi> was ſpoiled for this time: for <hi>Eleaman</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the whole authority of the Town, deferred the ſolemnity: and becauſe <hi>Erican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi>
was deſirous that we ſhould go and viſit <hi>Thomantes,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Delphire,</hi> ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me to go with her: and when we came to his chamber door, we heard him talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very loud: ſo as being told that he was all alone by himſelf, we went as ſoftly as
we could to hear what he ſaid; and being very near, we heard him make extream
complaints, as if he had received ſome ſtrange injury, offered unto the fidelity of his
Love; and perhaps he had continued longer in his lamentations, if <hi>Delphire</hi> had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> (purpoſely as I think) made a noiſe; being unwilling I ſhould hear any more:
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53527:203"/>
but ſhe kept a great buſtle at the door, and as if it had been againſt her will, oh what
a noiſe do I make (ſaid ſhe) It is no matter, ſaid I, ſeeming to take no notice of it;
upon this, opening the door, we entred into the chamber, We found him indeed,
in a very bad condition: for beſides the violence of his fever, which much perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, we ſaw his face all tears, which his jealous fancy had fetched from his heart.
This ſight, though he wiped his eyes as well as he could, might very well move my
companion: for I proteſt it moved me to much pity, not knowing what the matter
was, yet doubting that it was againſt her that he complained; ſo as looking upon
her, my very eyes invited her to give the Shepherd ſome comfort. And ſhe with
abundance of modeſty and diſcretion, went to his bed-ſide: Alas <hi>Thomantes!</hi> (ſaid
ſhe unto him) how long muſt our ſorrows laſt, in grieving at your ſickneſs? The
Shepherd then raiſing himſelf up, as deſirous to thank us for the favour which we
did him in the viſit. I am but too well in being ſick, anſwered he, ſince ſuch fair
Shepherdeſſes daign to have a care of me. But <hi>Thomantes</hi> (ſaid I unto him) if your
ſickneſs continue, you will cauſe ſmall joy for the Sacred Miſleto. Such an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Shepherd as <hi>Thomantes,</hi> anſwered he, can never hinder the joyes of ſo many
fair Shepherdeſſes, eſpecially ſuch as are ſo free, in their favours, as they care not if
all the the world do ſee them. <hi>Delphire</hi> till now never thought that the complaints
and ſickneſſe of this Shepherd proceeded from the flower which <hi>Filintes</hi> took from
her, and was very glad that ſhe had found it out, to the end ſhe might undeceive
him: but not being willing that I ſhould underſtand any thing of this difference, ſhe
ſeemed as if ſhe did not apprehend it, but turned her Diſcourſe into expreſſions of
<hi>Ericanthes</hi> ſorrows for his ſickneſs, and how much all the houſe was troubled at it:
and afterwards told him, how every one were preparing themſelves for the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and paſtimes of the day, and wanted aſſiſtants: briefly ſhe told him all that ſhe
could to cheer him up, and to undeceive him in the opinion which he was in that ſhe
favoured <hi>Filintes</hi> more then him; yet ſo cautiouſly, that I could not judge that ſhe
had any intereſt in thoſe favours ſhe ſpoke of. And becauſe I was not ignorant that
this Shepherd did love her, and knew how Lovers loved privacy, I walked up and,
down the chamber, looking upon every thing in it, and ſeemed very buſie in my
own thoughts, and all purpoſely to give them the better opportunities of private
talk. <hi>Delphire,</hi> who was very deſirous to undeceive him, and to loſe no time, leſt
any ſhould come in to interrupt, ſhe bowed her ſelf nearer him: Is it poſſible <hi>Thoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
(ſaid ſhe unto him in a low voice, and with a ſmiling eye) that you ſhould be
jealous? Is it poſſible <hi>Delphire</hi> (anſwered he) that you ſhould be ſo kind unto <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintes</hi>
as you are? and that I loving you as I do, ſhould not be as much in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
as he? Upon this, the Shepherdeſs could not hold from laughing: Oh Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
Shepherdeſſe, ſaid he, do you laugh at my miſery? What hopes can I have
ever to be happy? Truly (ſaid ſhe) I do laugh at a thing which you your ſelf would
laugh at with me, if you knew the truth: How? replied he, do you think I can
laugh to ſee one whom I would have to love me, love another? and that I ſhould
ſee <hi>Filintes</hi> with my own eyes trimm'd up in your favours, and not die with deſpair?
Oh <hi>Delphire,</hi> if you think ſo of me, you do more offend me by that thought then by
the favour which you have given him: for in your favouring of him more then me,
you do only intimate that I ſhould yeild unto him in happineſs; but by this thought
you do as good as tell me that you have an ill opinion of my love, which is an offence
ſo unjuſt, as is not to be endured, <hi>Thomantes, Thomantes,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him, never
let it trouble you, but ſet your heart at reſt, and be aſſured that in this I have not
offended either againſt you, or your love unto me: that which you call a Favour, was
a theft, a violent robbery, againſt which I could not defend my ſelf; ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
witneſſes are of it, that I need not inſiſt upon any farther clearing of my ſelf; for
my chamber was full of Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes; from whom, if you will not
believe me, you may know the truth.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince it is thus, as moſt truly it is, have I not good reaſon to laugh: No,
no, <hi>Thomantes,</hi> as long as you behave your ſelf towards me as you do, I ſhall have
more regard of your ſatisfaction then you imagine: and if this were a place fit to
chide in, I ſhould chide you for having ſo bad an opinion of that good will which I
bore unto you: but ſince I believe your diſpleaſure proceeded only from your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53527:204"/>
I will take it as an argument of that amity which you have promiſed unto me.
Oh Heavens (ſaid the Shepherd and kiſſed her hand) how near are extream con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments
in love, and extream diſcontents, unto one another? This Declaration
reſtores that life, which my opinion would have raviſhed from me. But deareſt
<hi>Delphire,</hi> may I without offence beg one favour from you, whith would compleat
my happineſſe? Tell me what it is, anſwered the Shepherdeſs, and if it be a thing
which depends upon me, you ſhall ſee how much I deſire your ſatisfaction. I moſt
heartily beſeech you, ſaid he, nay I conjure you, even by your ſelf, which is the
deareſt thing in the world unto me, that you would get back this flower, for I am
not able to ſee it in the hands of this raviſher, without a moſt ſtrange alteration, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you <hi>Thomantes,</hi> anſwered ſhe, that as well for your ſatisfaction as my own, I
will do all I can, and you ſhall know it.</p>
                     <p>She left him with this aſſurance, for many Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes came in
and hindred them from farther Diſcourſe. This viſit had a better operation upon
this Lover, then all the Phyſick which ſhould have been given unto him: for the
next morning, he left his ſickneſs in his bed, and found himſelf in perfect health.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Delphire</hi> not forgetting the Shepherds requeſt, ſhe no ſooner ſaw <hi>Filintes,</hi> but
ſhe uſed her beſt rethorique to procure the flower, pretending that ſhe would keep
it for her ſake who gave it: <hi>Filintes,</hi> who did not repent of the robbery which he
had committed, Do you think <hi>Delphire</hi> (ſaid he) that I value this which I have got
by lawful war, no more, then to part from it without a ranſom; what ranſom ſaid
ſhe, do you require? Some of thoſe knots, anſwered he, or thoſe ribands which
you wear. I have none to give you, anſwered ſhe; nor I any to reſtore, anſwered
he, but am very ſorry that I rob'd you of no more: what more, ſaid ſhe, would you
have taken? Your heart, anſwered he: as for that piece of thievery, anſwered ſhe,
I ſhould never have required reſtitution; but the flower which you have is much
better, and I wonder you ſhould have any ſatisfaction in retaining any thing againſt
ones will. What? (ſaid <hi>Filintes</hi>) is it againſt your will that I wear it? Me thinks,
anſwered ſhe, my deſires of having it again ſhould intimate as much; Then he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me to lend him a pair of Siſſers; which I did, not knowing what he would do
with them; and then he took off his hat, and cut the flower in a hundred pieces,
and threw them into the fire: then (ſaid he unto me) Here take your Siſſers, and I
thank you, for they have helped to revenge me againſt the diſpleaſure which was
conceived againſt me: then he roſe up in an angry mood, and it was a long time
before he would ſpeak unto her; but it was excellent ſport to ſee them together:
for he could not forbear from being where ſhe was, and often twit her in a ſplena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
way, ſtill addreſſing his ſpeech to a third perſon; and <hi>Delphire</hi> paid him back
again in the ſame coyn, with ſo much delight to all that heard them; that whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they two were together, every one flocked unto them to hear the quirks which
they put upon each other.</p>
                     <p>This divorce laſted until the day when the Miſleto was to be gathered: and that
day he came unto her very early, <hi>Delphire</hi> (ſaid he unto her) is the heat of your
choler now paſt? My choler, anſwered ſhe, never began againſt you, but perhaps
you mean your own. It may be ſo, replied he and ſmiled, for ſince I have nothing
but what is yours, my anger is yours. If you mean it ſo, ſaid <hi>Delphire,</hi> I fear you
do miſ-reckon your ſelf, for I know not who can make any thing mine, unleſſe I
will. <hi>Delphire,</hi> replied he, there are ſome things which we have by force: Is it not
commonly ſaid, ſuch a one has a fever; ſuch a one has the hatred of every one;
and ſuch a one has abundance of miſery, and yet I am confident they would not
have them: would you have me, replied <hi>Delphire,</hi> to have your anger in that way?
Not only my anger, ſaid he, but alſo my ſoul, my heart, my affection, and my all:
but <hi>Filintes,</hi> anſwered <hi>Delphire,</hi> take heed you do not draw a concluſion from hence,
which will put you into your ſplenatique mood again. What can you alledge, ſaid
he, which can give me any ſuch occaſion? God defend me, replied the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe
from the thought of it; but if you will give me leave, I will tell you, that ſuch
things as are forced upon one, do alſo make one ſtrive with all their power to be rid
of them; ſo as if that which I have of yours be of this quality, conſider with your
ſelf what concluſion may be drawn from thence. Oh moſt cruel and diſdainful
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53527:204"/>
Shepherdeſs, ſaid he, can you vent nothing but arguments of your ſcorn and ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of me? I was in hopes this morning to have obtained a favour from you,
that I might have flouriſhed in it under the notion of your Shepherd, but now I find
my hopes are all blaſted, and that you ſcorn and ſlight me more then ever. You
are miſtaken Shepherd, ſaid <hi>Delphire,</hi> I never ſcorned any thing that had relation
unto you; no, I do honour both you and your family: but I was forced to anſwer
unto your aſſertions which you uſed unto me. I ſhall quickly know, replied he, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you ſpeak truth; for if you do not ſcorn, I ſhould be known this day as your
Shepherd; pray give me that knot which is upon your head, in teſtimony of your
good will. I am afraid, ſaid ſhe, leſt you ſhould cut it in pieces, as you did the flower
which you took from me. Perhaps it might run the ſame fortune (ſaid he) if you
would take it away from me. You need not doubt, replied ſhe, but if you ſhould
raviſh it from me, as you did the flower, I ſhould do the ſame. What would you
think, replied <hi>Filintes,</hi> if I ſhould not let you reſt all this day, until I have that knot?
Upon this, he put forth his hand to take it; but the Shepherdeſs being aware of him,
recoyled, and went unto <hi>Ericanthe;</hi> but ſtill he followed her, and importun'd her
for this knot. No, no, <hi>Filintes,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Delphire</hi>) you ſhall not have it, unleſs <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthe</hi>
command me. I will not receive it, replied he, upon <hi>Ericanthes</hi> command:
no, no, ungrateful <hi>Delphire,</hi> deceive not your ſelf, I deſire no favours from you,
but ſuch as proceed from your free and good will: I would have them to be gifts of
Love, and not tributes of obedience; upon this, he went away in a fretting fume.
And fortune was ſo averſe unto him all that day, as he received no contentment
from any thing he took in hand.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>Thomantes,</hi> continuing his courtſhip of this Shepherdeſs,
without the leaſt complaint or murmure; every action about this proud Beauty,
made <hi>Filintes</hi> jealous, who ſeeing him ſo patient, and judging of things according to
his own humour, he could not imagine any one ſhould endure the cruelties of her
whom he loved with ſo much ſilence, unleſs he was tyed unto it by ſome great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
ſo as he concluded very advantagiouſly for his rival. This opinion did tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him ſo extreamly, that one day when he was almoſt out of his wits, he went
unto the Shepherdeſs; and though it was long ſince he had ſpoke unto her, yet at
the very firſt ſight he accoſted her with this language: reſolve with your ſelf to ſee
one of theſe three things come preſently to paſſe. For either I muſt change, or
you muſt change, or I muſt die. The Shepherdeſs returned him this faint anſwer: for
me to change, is a thing impoſſible; that you ſhould die, would grieve me; and
for you to change, is of leſs importance unto me, and depends wholly upon your
own will. Oh Heavens (cryed he out) is all this cruelty to be endured? and yet
I muſt love this inſenſible woman. Upon this, he pulled his hat over his eyes, and
went away, more tranſported with choller then ever he was: But as his Spirit was
quickly hot, ſo it was quickly cool for when he was in his greateſt fury, if <hi>Delphire</hi> did
but ſpeak one word unto him, he was appeaſed, and ſeemed as if he had no memory
of thoſe offences and wrongs at which he was angry.</p>
                     <p>All things thus far went well with <hi>Thomantes,</hi> ſo as he might well think himſelf
one of the happieſt Shepherds about <hi>Lignon;</hi> and I believe <hi>Aſphales</hi> might have ſaid
as much, had he not been abſent, for he could not have ſeen any Shepherd ſo much
in my favour as himſelf: but ſince that jealouſies, and by conſequence inquietudes
have ſo ravelled their ſouls, as I believe they enjoy but a little reſt, and we but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more: Thus, Wiſe Shepherdeſs, this is the cauſe which has brought us hither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, according to the anſwer of the Oracle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſphales,</hi> as I told you, before was abſent; and <hi>Thomantes</hi> was conſtrained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
by the ſame deſtiny to be abſent from <hi>Delphire,</hi> and alſo to go into the ſame
Province of the Romans, where <hi>Aſphales</hi> was already. Perhaps I ſhould be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
in relating all the Diſcourſe of this Shepherd, and all his laments a little before
his departure: but ſo it was, that he gave unto this Shepherdeſs of poſſible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of a conſtant, and laſting affection; his expreſſions came from him with ſuch
an emphaſis, as if his heart had been in his tongue, and thoſe that would not believe
them, had been as incredulous, as that falſe Shepherd who uttered them was perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and who afterwards was quite wafted away with inconſtancy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:53527:205"/>
He departed with the prayers and ſorrows of all that he left behind him. And
becauſe <hi>Eleaman</hi> the Wiſe Paſtor would needs out of his affection ſee him take horſe,
and was not ignorant of the good will which his Son bore unto this Shepherdeſſe,
when he ſaw him a little gone, he turned towards her, and in a jeſting manner ſaid,
he is gone, and none of theſe fair Maids lament him: and becauſe as he ſpoke thoſe
words, he had his eyes upon <hi>Delphire,</hi> ſhe ſmiled; which was obſerved by many,
and afterwards when <hi>Filintes</hi> returned, for he accompanied <hi>Thomantes</hi> a little way,
and was told of this: Oh moſt cruel, hard-harted, and inſenſible woman, ſaid he,
can Heaven ſuffer ſo much injuſtice? Does all the ſervices which <hi>Thomantes</hi> has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
unto you, merit no more then to laugh at him when he goes away, and when
he goes away with ſo much ſorrow to part from you? But the beſt conceipt was, he
was really offended at the injury which he thought ſhe had done unto his rival.
And to ſee the humour of this young Shepherd: as long as <hi>Thomantes</hi> was abſent,
there was not a day wherein he did not put <hi>Delphire</hi> in memory of him. And at any
time when he did her any trivial ſervice; I wiſh, ſaid he, that this were put upon the
ſcore of <hi>Thomantes.</hi> But that which is hardly credible, is, when <hi>Thomantes</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<hi>Filintes</hi> vexed himſelf, and fainted at every ſillable which <hi>Delphire</hi> uttered:
but when he was abſent, he took all well, and was as patient, as if nothing could
move him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thomantes</hi> who was abſent, and longed to hear how <hi>Delphire</hi> did, was preſently
acquainted how <hi>Filintes</hi> was changed in his humour. This news began to gripe him
a little at the heart: and as fortune would have it, he and <hi>Aſphales</hi> meeting in a
ſtrange Country, they contracted (as it is uſual) a more intimate familiarity then
ever they had before: ſo as always one of them was receiving news how ſquares
went at home. As ill luck was, thoſe who writ unto <hi>Aſphales</hi> did ſend him ſomtimes
ſuch news concerning <hi>Delphire,</hi> as they fancied: and thoſe who gave intelligence
unto <hi>Thomantes,</hi> did write of me according to their opinions, not knowing what
great familiarity there was betwixt them. They who took all for truths, and did
believe what was written. Unto <hi>Aſphales</hi> was written, that <hi>Filintes</hi> had ſo gained
the heart of <hi>Delphire,</hi> as now there was no room for <hi>Thomantes.</hi> And unto <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes</hi>
they ſent word, that ſince his departure, <hi>Androgenes</hi> was ſo in love with me,
as that I had no eyes but to look upon him; ſo as theſe two poor Shepherds, when
perhaps they had moſt cauſe to be contented, they thought they had moſt cauſe to
complain againſt us. They counſelled and conſulted together; and I am ſure not
without ſomtimes talking of our changing humours. In concluſion, both of them
having haſted, or rather hudled up their buſineſs, that they might the ſooner look
homeward, we heard of their return: <hi>Ericanthe</hi> expected her Son with ſuch impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency,
that ſhe went as far as the Town of <hi>Boen</hi> to meet him: <hi>Delphire</hi> that day
was not well, and therefore intended not to ſtir out of her chamber. <hi>Filintes</hi> not
being able to endure that <hi>Thomantes</hi> ſhould receive ſuch a diſpleaſure, he came to
pray and beſeech her by all means, that ſhe would keep <hi>Ericanthe</hi> company upon
this occaſion, which he aſſured her would be very well taken, and that for his part
he would take it for a very particular obligation; and was ſo very importunate in his
deſires, and ſupplications, as at laſt, he obtained that which none elſe could: But
when <hi>Thomantes</hi> heard from <hi>Delphire</hi> her ſelf, that the favour which he received
was by the interceſſion of <hi>Filintes,</hi> he grew extreamly jealous at it: and upon this
reaſon, he ſet himſelf ever ſince to obſerve and watch the actions of <hi>Filintes</hi> and
<hi>Delphire</hi> more narrowly. And ſo much the rather, becauſe his rival was grown ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
familiar with all the Shepherdeſſes, which ſtung <hi>Thomantes</hi> to the heart; for he
could not imagine that this familiarity could proceed from any thing but Love, and
not out of habitude: yet at the firſt he ſeemed to take no notice, but diſſembled his
paſſion as diſcreetly as poſſibly he could.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſphales</hi> alſo, whoſe head was full of that news which was written unto <hi>Thoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
concerning the affection between <hi>Androgenes</hi> and me, he alſo made a fair ſhew,
and ſet himſelf to be a ſpy over our actions, out of which he drew no conſequences
to my advantage. I know not how it came to paſs: but I being at that time in <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthes</hi>
chamber, where there was a great number of Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes,
<hi>Androgenes</hi> deſired to talk with me, as it is uſual at ſuch aſſemblies, for every one to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53527:205"/>
addreſs themſelves unto ſuch as they have familiarity withall, rather then unto ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
but becauſe I took notice that <hi>Aſphales</hi> obſerved us, being unwilling to give
him any occaſion of diſcontent, I turned another way, and would not ſpeak unto
him; and ſee how one is ſomtimes deceived in their deſign: this action being obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by <hi>Aſphales,</hi> it made him ſuſpect all that he ſaw not, and think that all was
true which had been written concerning <hi>Androgenes</hi> and me: and the worſt was;
<hi>Androgenes</hi> obſerving how I declined ſpeaking unto him in conſideration of <hi>Aſpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
he never ſought for any opportunity of ſpeaking unto me during all that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
but there being a great Looking-glaſſe upon the table, which was fixed to the
wall, this diſcreet Shepherd did caſt his eyes into it; and as fortune was, I looked
into it at the ſame time: <hi>Androgenes</hi> ſhrugged his ſhoulders, as if he complained of
my behaviour to him, and I not utterly to diſoblige him, did wink upon him with
one eye, which perhaps was ſome contentment to him: but I proteſt, it was only
out of deſire to hide the odd humour of <hi>Aſphales:</hi> but as ill ſuck would have it; he
took notice of all theſe ſigns, and ſuppoſing thereby that there was ſome cloſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency
betwixt us, he was ſo netled, that he went out of the houſe, and was not
ſeen all night.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you will think it ſtrange, diſcreet Shepherdeſs, that <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phales,</hi>
who at their departures had ſuch ſmall ſhares in our good will, ſhould at
their returns pretend ſo abſolutely unto them: but you muſt know, that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
our affections during their abſence, more then whilſt they were continually
with us; for when they were amongſt us, and ſerved us, we ſuppoſed they did it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſaw no greater beauties then our ſelves: but when we heard that after
they had ſeen the world, and in it many beauties ſuperior unto ours, and yet kept
themſelves conſtant unto us, we eſteemed their affections at a higher rate, ſo as by
our Letters to them, they knew that their abſence obtained that which their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
had denied them.</p>
                     <p>This was the reaſon that the leaſt favour which we ſhewed unto others, ſeeming
unto them a taking away their dues, they could not endure we ſhould ſo much as
look upon any but them. If we chanced to caſt the leaſt glance of an eye upon any
one, then theſe Shepherds; or rather theſe Tyrants, were ready to flye in our faces,
and would oblige us to ſuch a conſtraint as was intollerable: but becauſe <hi>Delphire</hi>
and I did not like to be baniſhed from all the world, we continued our converſation,
not only with <hi>Filintes</hi> and <hi>Androgenes,</hi> but alſo with any others that addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto us; the number of which was not ſmall; and behaved our ſelves towards
them as was fitting, leſt we ſhould give occaſion unto any of ſpeaking ill of us; which
they did take ſo ill, that after they had called a counſel amongſt them two, as if they
were to govern and direct us, they reſolved to put a face of coldneſs, and afterwards
to ſeem as if they loved ſome others. But not knowing whom to chuſe for ſuch a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
they would only ſeem to ſtand as Neuters and be indifferent; and for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
they came at laſt unto down right incivility, for ſo may their behaviours
unto us be termed, ſince they did not only leave off addreſſes and courting us as they
were wont; but when they met us at any time in <hi>Ericanthes</hi> chamber, or any where
elſe, they would not ſo much as look upon us. If at any time we found them in a
place where it was impoſſible for them to turn away their eyes from us, it was with
ſo much ſcorn, and they rendred their ſalutes in ſuch a diſdainful manner, as was
not civil.</p>
                     <p>This ſtrange way of behaviour and proceeding, cauſed every one to take notice
of it, and almoſt all that heard of it, did tax them with inconſtancy and levity: but
they on the contrary, maintained that they were the ſame they were always wont to
be, that they had not changed, but loved us and honoured us, as much as ever they
did; that it was buſineſs which they were conſtrained to follow, concerning the
eſtate which belonged to their family, which did divert them, and hinder them from
imploying all their time in thoſe trivial ſervices which they were wont to render. <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire</hi>
and I muſt confeſs, oh ſage <hi>Diana,</hi> that after we had ſeveral times talked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(for our fortunes were the ſame, and required the ſame remedies) we reſolved,
to take all manner of excuſes from theſe two wavering minds, by retiring our ſelves
from all thoſe who might give them the leaſt umbrage; and to do it the more
handſomly, we took this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:53527:206"/>
                        <hi>Eleaman</hi> and <hi>Ericanthe</hi> took great delight in ſeeing Comedies acted by thoſe in
their own houſe: and <hi>Delphire,</hi> as ſhe that had the beſt wit, had commonly one of
the beſt parts: It hapned that <hi>Delphire</hi> in the play was to tell a Shepherd that he
was never to hope for any thing in her affection: by chance ſhe ſpied <hi>Filintes</hi> very
near the Theater harkning and admiring her action; and conceiving him to be the
greateſt cauſe of jealouſie in <hi>Thomantes,</hi> when ſhe was to ſpeak unto the Shepherd
in the Comedy, ſhe turned her ſelf directly to <hi>Filintes,</hi> and as if he had hore a part in
the play, and ſaid thus unto him; I do ſwear unto thee Shepherd, that I can and will
ſooner die a hundred deaths, then love thee: ceaſe all thy hopes, trouble me no
more with thy love, for Shepherd I do hate thee.</p>
                     <p>The face of <hi>Delphire</hi> being turned towards <hi>Filintes,</hi> and her eyes and geſtures ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
unto him, was a cauſe, that not only the poor Shepherd knew her meaning,
but alſo <hi>Thomantes,</hi> and almoſt all the Spectators, which cauſed all eyes to be caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, who durſt not before all that company let his anger appear.</p>
                     <p>A few dayes after, when we were upon the banks of the Chriſtal River of <hi>Lignon,</hi>
and as we were paſſing away the time upon the Sands by the River ſide; <hi>Aſphales,
Androgenes,</hi> and many other Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, were all about me: and
I writ upon the Sand, I LOVE: <hi>Androgenes</hi> looking over my ſhoulder, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what I had writ upon the Sand, is it I (ſaid he, and ſmiled) for whom you writ
that word? Yes, anſwered I, and I obſerved that <hi>Aſphales</hi> blushed when I ſpoke
that word: but do you underſtand, continued I, what it ſignifies? I do underſtand
the word, anſwered he, perhaps not the meaning of the writer, anſwered I, for I
mean that the Love which I bear unto you, is like the writing which you ſee, (and
trod upon it with my foot) and which you ſhall never ſee again. <hi>Aſphales,</hi> and all
that heard me, fell into ſuch extream laughter, which perhaps ſurpriſed <hi>Androgenes,</hi>
as much as what I ſaid unto him.</p>
                     <p>One would think, ſage Shepherdeſſes, that theſe two actions of <hi>Delphire</hi> and me,
ſhould have contented theſe two ſtubborn Lovers, if at the leaſt, this term Lovers, be
not too good for them; but on the contrary, they ſtill continued their high humours,
and whenſoever they came into company, they preſently began to ſing their inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
ſongs againſt us, upbraiding us with inconſtancy.</p>
                     <p>Now, ſage Shepherdeſs, we both of us reſolved to have no more to do with them,
but become as very ſtrangers, as if we had never ſeen them; &amp; to the end none ſhould
think we caſt them off by reaſon of any new affections, we retired our ſelves at the
ſame time from all manner of converſation, not upon a ſudden, leſt it ſhould be
thought ſtrange: but ſee, fair and Wiſe Shepherdeſs, how thoſe who upbraided us
with inconſtancy, are inconſtant themſelves; we had not lived above two months in
this cold reſtraint, but as if our Ice, by a contrary operation had re-kindled fire in
their ſouls, they come and caſt themſelves at our feet with all manner of ſubmiſſion
and prayers; but I know not whether I ſhould ſay, with the ſame importunities they
uſed before. <hi>Filintes,</hi> and <hi>Androgenes,</hi> were the firſt who oppoſed them at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
ſaying, that their inconſtancy was too great and groſs, ever to be entertained
or endured; and that if ſuch Weather-cock minds were not puniſhed by ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
corrections, there would be no faith or loyalty amongſt Shepherds. We whoſe
humours were well enough diſpoſed never to entertain them again, did eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto the opinion of <hi>Filintes,</hi> and <hi>Androgenes.</hi> And in this reſolution, as oft as
<hi>Aſphales</hi> and <hi>Thomantes</hi> came to us, we laid their inconſtancy before them; and they
on the contrary, to ſhew that no cauſe is ſo bad but will find ſome maintainers, they
uſed all the arguments and reaſons they could, to juſtifie themſelves, affirming that
they were not inconſtant, and asked what inconſtancy was, and within what terms
and limits it was confined, when it was made a rule, or rather a Law, and then main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that they did never break that Law. This diſpute went ſo far, that in the end,
being wearied with their importunate prayers, we all reſolved together to addreſſe
our ſelf unto the Oracle for a deciſion of the controverſie; by whoſe anſwer we
were ſent unto you, fair and Wiſe Shepherdeſs; from whom we wait for a juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to deliver us all from burthens, that are too heavy to be endured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doriſſea</hi> thus ended her Diſcourſe, and after an humble reverence, ſhe returned
unto her place, to vvait for vvhat the Shepherdeſs <hi>Diana</hi> vvould ordain; vvho after
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53527:206"/>
ſhe had asked the opinion of <hi>Alexis, Aſtrea, Phillis, Sylvander,</hi> and ſome others, ſhe
ordained, that <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>Aſphales</hi> ſhould deliver their reaſons, by vvhich they

                                 <p>WE do ſee, and know very vvell, oh moſt juſt Judge! that it vvas upon great
reaſon you ordained <hi>Aſphales</hi> and me to deliver unto you thoſe reaſons by
which we may clear our innocency, and wipe off thoſe aſperſions, which the malice of
our accuſers had caſt upon us; for otherwiſe it is impoſſible any humane underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth, which is now put into doubt: the
artifice of thoſe who have done the wrong is great, and they have ſo gilded over
rotten reaſons with flouriſhing arguments of eloquence, as it is a very hard matter
to ſee the ſimple and pure face of truth, but by the oppoſitions and anſwers of thoſe
that are oppreſſed.</p>
                                 <p>We do ſee, and know alſo very well, that we who have hitherto made it our whole
buſineſs, profeſſion, and ſtudy, to love well, and not to ſpeak well, are by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of thoſe whom we have ſerved, driven to defend our ſelves by words. It is a
very hard matter for us to ſpeak well, that which we have ſo perfectly and ſo religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
obſerved; in as much as none ought to meddle in that miſtery and trade
which they have not learned, and of which they have not made profeſſion: and,
oh our juſt Judge, is it not very hard, that we who have made it our whole profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to love well, and not to ſpeak well, ſhould now be driven to that which is not our
profeſſion, and to uſe words to verifie our actions, to which we referred all our elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and rethorique. This conſideration makes us extreamly doubt the iſſue of
this enterpriſe, knowing very well, that we have to do with perſons, who quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto us, have more ſtudied to ſpeak well without loving, then love well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpeaking: now all the arms which we are to uſe, are only words, which being
their own, and in which they are exerciſed and skilful, moſt certainly they know
better how to uſe them then we; and therefore have a very great advantage of us,
unleſs our juſt Judge by her prudence, and ſoundneſs of judgment, do balance the
ſincerity of our naked reaſons, againſt the gilded gloſſes, and well ſpeaking of our
adverſaries: and upon this confidence, we take the boldneſs to preſent our reaſons
plainly unto you, and as briefly as poſſibly we can.</p>
                                 <p>But when all is well conſidered, what kind of accuſations, (oh my friend <hi>Aſpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>)
are thoſe which they charge upon us? Had they blamed us for loving too much;
had they accuſed us of being tranſported with too much violent affection: had they
ſaid that, we go beyond the limits of Love; had they complained that the exceſſe of
our paſſion makes us troubleſome, or inſupportable in our continual addreſſes, theſe
accuſations, might perhaps have had ſome ſhadow of likelyhood; and we ſhould
have found a hard task to diſcharge our ſelves of ſuch objections. But that they
ſhould accuſe us that we ſhould not Love thoſe whom none can look upon, without
adoration! Is not this, to mock us, and thoſe (if I may ſay ſo) that hear them?
Can they ſay <hi>Aſphales</hi> does not love, whoſe affection ſurmounted ſo long an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?
If abſence be called the Death of Love, what ſhould one ſay of that Love
which is not dead after ſo long an abſence, but that certainly it is immortal? Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
then is the love of <hi>Aſphales</hi> unto <hi>Doriſſea;</hi> Immortal is that of <hi>Thomantes</hi> unto
the fair <hi>Delphire,</hi> who have not only reſiſted abſence, but alſo the rigours of that
fair one, which perhaps had been inſupportable unto any other: length of time,
which they ſay ruins and rots the moſt laſting thing, never ſhook his conſtancy; no
nor any monſters of difficulties which he met with, nay even impoſſibilities, were not
able to ſtop him in his deſigned courſe: Oh Gods! who does not know that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes</hi>
hath loved the fair <hi>Delphire</hi> even in her Cradle? at an age when ſhe was not
capable (if I may ſay ſo) of knowing either to love, or cauſe love? And can it be
imagined that <hi>Thomantes</hi> ſhould now fall off, and not love her, when her eyes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
all that they daign to look upon, and caſt their rayes on? Who can have ſeen
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53527:207"/>
this <hi>Thomantes</hi> overcome all the rigours and ſcorns of <hi>Delphire;</hi> abide the length of
time; ſurmount all difficulties, and believe that the ſame <hi>Thomantes</hi> ſhould not
love her, when this fair Monſter of Beauty ſeemed pliable to his will and deſires?
Truly theſe accuſations are as far from any common ſence, as they are from reaſon
and truth; and there is no other anſwer to be given unto them, but this, that there
is no diſputing againſt thoſe that will deny principles: and no more ought I againſt
thoſe perſons who make theſe oppoſitions, who yet do fill Heaven and Earth with
their complaints againſt us, and will by force have us confeſs that we do not love
them.</p>
                                 <p>They will needs take upon them to know what we do, better then we our ſelves:
Love is an act of the will; and is there any ſo clear ſighted, as can ſee my will better
then my ſelf? But as humane nature is more apt to believe the bad then the good, ſo
ſhould we but once tell <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Doriſſea,</hi> that we do not love them, oh how
preſently would they believe us? But if we ſhould tell them, and tell them again, a
thouſand and a thouſand times that we do infinitely love them, they would preſently
ſay it was not true. Why ſhould you not believe us in the one as well as in the other?
But we (and it is no ſmall argument of that love which you deny to be in us) if you
once tell us that you do love us, we preſently believe it, and never make the leaſt
doubt of the truth; and from whence proceeds this eaſie faith and belief? Even from
love; from love I ſay, which makes us believe, that truth as well as all other virtues is
in the perſon loved, ſo conſequently in you. But theſe fair ones would never confeſs
that we loved them, but alwayes denied it, and now they tax us with inconſtancy.
This laſt injury (my dear <hi>Aſphales</hi>) is an argument for us, for from their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
muſt be concluded, that we do love them now; for they confeſs that we did not
love them heretofore, and by ſaying that we are inconſtant, they ſay, that we do
love now: in this ſence, fair Shepherdeſſes, we ſhould agree with you, were it not
that Love (who forced this truth from your own mouths againſt your wills) will not
let us confeſs, that we did not love you before: but on the contrary, we do ſay, and
maintain, that we did love you, and do love you, and ever ſhall love you: and that
never was affection more perfect then the affection of <hi>Aſphales</hi> and <hi>Thomantes.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Now the main argument they have againſt our affection, is, that our actions have
not given ſufficient teſtimonies, that we love them: Conſider, (oh moſt juſt Judge)
conſider I beſeech you, upon what a ſandy foundation this charge is built, and how
quickly it will fall to the ground: when our actions and behaviours to them were all
fire, and full of impatiencies, then they charged us that we did not love them; when we
ſaw this way would not prevail, nor perſwade them to believe the truth of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we had recourſe unto the contrary: we put on a garb of coldneſs, and became
all patience; but they forgetting the judgment they had before given, do now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
us of want of love more ſharply then before. What ſhould we do, if to our
miſ-fortune two contraries do work the ſame effect upon their unjuſt ſouls: if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heat nor cold will teſtifie our Love, what can we do? Yet theſe conſiderations,
or rather contradictions, do put us unto abundance of pains: not that they who do
ſee and weigh every thing with a ſound judgment, can ever enter into any doubt of
us: but ſince there are more of thoſe who are inclined to judge ill of others, then of
thoſe who hold an even ſcale of judgment, it muſt enſue, that the greater part of men
will blame us: and which is worſt of all, or which is indeed inſupportable, theſe fair
ones may nouriſh a ſtiniſter opinion of us in their ſouls, although we never courted
any thing with more deſires, then to perſwade them of the contrary: and therefore
though we know very well that we ought in all other things to yeild unto them; yet
in this, we are conſtrained to contradict them, and bring the matter unto the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of another; which we would not have to be taken as any defect of love or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
but rather for exceſs, and height of affection, which tranſports us beyond all
rules of duty. In this exceſſe, we have ſeveral times deſired, that ſince they do
charge us with inconſtancy, they would firſt agree that heretofore we did love them,
and afterwards that they would preſcribe unto us thoſe limits in which a Lover ought
to keep himſelf within compaſs of this conſtancy, to the end one may judge, as by a
ſtraight rule, whether the line be right, and come no neerer one ſide then another;
and ſo, oh our juſt Judge, it may appear whether we be inconſtant or no. The Gods
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53527:207"/>
are they who have ſent us unto you; and the Gods are they will inſpire you with a
ſpirit of right judgment. But in the mean time we do require and conjure the God
of Love, to take away all incredulity out of the ſouls of theſe fair ones, which makes
them condemn our actions, which truly if they were different from what they were
wont to be, it was not out of any alteration of will, but urgent affairs which was
the cauſe, and which hindred us from paying the tribute of thoſe trivial ſervices we
were wont to render, and in which we could not imploy our time without much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
unto our eſtates. Has not all ſeaſons their proper actions; does not nature
teach us, that flowers are proper for the ſpring, and fruits for ſummer; if trees
ſhould bloom all the year, they would bloom in vain; and why ſhould not the ſame
be ſaid of us? If we ſhould be alwayes bearing thoſe little flowers, which are proper
and natural at the beginning of Love, we ſhould not produce ſo much fruit in the
ſummer of Love, but ſhould in a manner derogate from the Law of Nature. But
perhaps, that which induceth them to this opinion, is the more familiar converſation
which we have with others, then we were wont to have; and that this converſation
proceeds from ſome Love we bear unto thoſe we are familiar with all: truly if a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ought to be a ſalvage perſon, and without communication, I muſt confeſs, they
have reaſon; but ſince the name of Lover does not ſignifie any Wilde Man, or
Wolf, or Tyger, or Barbarian, we ſee no reaſon or ground they have for their
opinions.</p>
                                 <p>All theſe doubts, and all theſe judgements which they have conceived of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
muſt receive a deciſion from you, ſage Shepherdeſs; we mean thoſe doubts
and judgments which they have in diſ-advantage of our affection: for of all other
things whereof they blame and accuſe us, as we are <hi>Aſphales</hi> and <hi>Thomantes,</hi> we
dare not ſo much as whiſper the leaſt complaint againſt them; but will with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and reſpect ſuffer what they pleaſe: but when they accuſe us as we are Lovers,
then we are forced to open our mouths, not to accuſe or complain againſt them, but
to ſigh, as thoſe do whom exceſſive pain torments above their ſtrength: otherwiſe
we could ſay; that when they charge us with inconſtancy, they themſelves are the
cauſe of our change, and ſhould ſeek out for ſome reaſons to excuſe it: and ſhould
urge that ſo many ſervices paid and received, did not deſerve, that <hi>Filintes,</hi> during
the abſence of <hi>Thomantes,</hi> ſhould be entertained in his place; nor <hi>Androgenes</hi> in the
room of <hi>Aſphales:</hi> that the favours which both thoſe received during our abſence,
would afford us ample matter and cauſe to accuſe them: that the news which was
writ unto us from all ſides, was enough to make us believe it. And becauſe they
ſay that a woman neither can nor ought to hinder any from loving them; ſo it be
with all requiſite diſcretion, reſpect and honour: we ask your judgment, oh our
moſt juſt Judge, upon theſe four queſtions; firſt, whether ſhe who permits many to
love and ſerve her, do keep her ſelf within compaſs of the Laws of Conſtancy? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
if this plurality of Lovers be allowed unto women, whether may it not be as
well allowed unto men? Thirdly, whether the Laws of Conſtancy do ordain that a
Lover ſhould flye the ſight of all other Shepherdeſſes? And laſtly, what are the
terms and limits of this Conſtancy, ſo much talked of by all, and ſo little known unto
any: and all this, to the end that theſe fair Shepherdeſſes may know whether or no
we be true and faithful Lovers, and not be offended, if our affections cannot endure
ſuch injuries ſhould be offered unto them. In all theſe things, oh moſt juſt Judge, we
deſire and expect your judgement.</p>

words he argues, not with reaſons, but with diſ-reaſons, if I may coyn the word.

love) I could with the ſame fluency of tongue make a long oppoſition of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
yet I will not, as well becauſe that were to abuſe the patience of our Judg,
and all that hear me; as becauſe all their arguments are grounded upon ſuch ſimple
foundations, and gloſſed over with ſuch thin covers, as the falſity of them are eaſily
ſeen: and truly ſeen ſo clearly, that I ſhould not think them worth an anſwer, were
it not in obedience unto the command of our juſt Judge.</p>
                                 <p>To begin then, What do you mean <hi>Thomantes,</hi> by all this talk of your affection?
You who ſayes you are accuſtomed to Love without ſpeaking, as we are to ſpeaking
without love? What do you mean, I ſay, ſince you do confeſs that if <hi>Doriſſea</hi> and I do
but ſay once that we love you, you will believe us for ever? Ah Shepherd, ſince we
have been ſo accuſtomed to ſpeaking, what do you complain of? Why are you
not both ſatisfied? To what purpoſe did you make addreſſes to the Oracle, and
trouble this Aſſembly with ſo many words, ſince we have been ſo accuſtomed to
ſpeaking it? But, oh juſt Judge, I perceive the ſtrength and ſubtilty of his argument;
he dares not directly ſay, that we are accuſtomed to ſpeaking it; but only, that we
are accuſtomed, as much to ſay that we love, and yet do not love, as they are to love,
and yet not ſpeaking it; and becauſe that they have not been accuſtomed to love, it
conſequently follows that neither have we been accuſtomed to ſpeaking it: and in
this ſence they are in the right; for it is very hard to ſpeak of a thing which they do
not know, witneſs all the diſcourſe of <hi>Thomantes,</hi> in which there are not more words
then contradictions. But to give them ſome ſatisfaction, let us confeſſe that they
cannot ſpeak well upon this ſubject, becauſe if they loved heretofore, as they ſay
they did, they loved without ſpeaking it, and that now they do not love, they are
yet conſtrained to ſpeak: well, we will allow this; and now <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>Aſpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
are you contented? You may be, at leaſt ſince you are allowed what you ask;
but what's all this to our difference? Nothing at all; nor is it any proof that they do
love us: for it might perhaps be available, if men, I mean men of their age, did guide
themſelves by reaſon, then one might infer from hence ſomthing of what they ſay:
but for them, who do all things at hazard, out of humours, and nothing according to
the right rules of reaſon, what can one infer from hence, but that then their humour
was ſuch and now is quite different? But, ſay they, why ſhould they then take ſo
much paines? To which we anſwer, who can find the reaſon of that which has no
reaſon? I ſay, it was either out of obſtinacy, or to deceive, or out of ambition of the
name of a Lover without any effects, or out of ſome worſe, or more pernitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.
What reaſon can be expected from perſons that are unreaſonable? But (ſay
they) we do know, that we do love: is there any that knows our own wills and
minds better then our ſelves? Oh moſt, juſt Judge, there is no queſtion but others
may know them better; can any judge aright whoſe Spirits are prepoſſeſſed with
paſſion? What likelyhood is there that theſe Shepherds can give any ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon a thing that concerns themſelves. But we who are without paſſion, and
are unconcerned in any thing which concerns them, we judge ſoundly. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
cannot thoſe that ſee <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> better judge of his madneſs then himſelf? And to
ſhew that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                                    </gap> the very ſame things, in one minute? O Gods! (cry they out) that
humane nature ſhould be apter to believe the bad ſooner then the good: certainly
they mean, the natures of men, and particularly of <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>Aſphales:</hi> as for
our parts, we neither believe nor unbelieve, but what is fit ſo to be; and to ſhew
that it is ſo, we do confeſſe unto you, that if you tell us you do not love us, we do
believe it; for commonly every one believes what they deſire. Moreover we do
know by experience, that you cannot love: when you tell us that you do love us, we
do not believe it, becauſe we know all men are lyers, which is a miſtery in Love which
we are ignorant in, and cannot do it. But all your actions do belie your words. And
when you tell us any thing to your own advantage, we give no credit thereunto, for
we know that you uſe to flatter your ſelves: when it is to your diſadvantage, we do
believe it, knowing very well that then it is true: and therefore you may ſee that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53527:208"/>
our belief is grounded upon reaſon, and that which you ſay of u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                                    </gap> is untrue.</p>
                                 <p>But, oh juſt Judge, here is a fine piece of oſtentation: the Love, ſay they, which
is in us, does make us believe, that you ſpeak true: and <hi>Thomantes,</hi> if you believe
ſo, why are you not aſſured that I do not love <hi>Filintes,</hi> nor <hi>Doriſſea, Androgenes,</hi>
ſince we have ſo often told you ſo? But to relate all their contradictions would be
too tedious; I will briefly anſwer unto thoſe objections which have weight in them;
it muſt needs be (ſaid they) that if we did not love you heretofore, and now you call
us inconſtant, you do as much as ſay, that we do love you: Shepherds, without ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our thoughts, either of love or hatred, we called you inconſtants; as much to ſay
that you had changed your lives; and in that your inconſtancy is indubitable: and
that which we do charge you withal, you do not deny before all this Aſſembly, ſo as
we are not obliged to prove a thing which is not put in doubt; and you never needed
to excuſe the change with that ſhallow argument which you alledged, that having
uſed all actions of fire, and finding we did not believe them to be ſparks of Love, you
had recourſe unto actions of Ice; for beſides that this argument is moſt ridiculous,
there is no neceſſity of alledging it, ſince you do know very well in your own ſouls,
that all theſe flames and fires whereof you ſpeak, are meerly imaginary, and only to
gloſs over your Diſcourſe. And it is no wonder at all that we ſhould not believe
them, ſince they are but only flouriſhes, and ſeeming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if you did love us. And is
there any doubt of it, ſince for all your Ice and cold fits, you have made addreſſes,
and courted others before our faces. Is not the voice of the people, the voice of
God? Would you have us give our own eyes, and our own ears, the lye, and not
believe when every one ſayes it, and when we ſee it by your actions? We never
courted any (ſay they) but only out of a deſire to perſwade them: ah Shepherd,
you have confeſſed the truth without a rack; it is very true Shepherd, you did never
court any, but to perſwade us that you did love us; but it was to perſwade only, and
not to love us: Alas we knew this ambition in you long ſince, and if we did not, yet
now we do; and it is better to be late wiſe then never.</p>
                                 <p>But what a moſt delicate excuſe they have to cover their changing? If our actions
and behaviours (ſay they) were different from what they were wont to be, it was
becauſe multitude of buſineſs and urgent occaſions did divert us: Then <hi>Thomantes,</hi>
if you any time came unto me, it ſeems it was only becauſe you had nothing elſe to
do, and know not how to trifle away your time any where elſe: oh how much am I
beholding to you? Am I not infinitely indebted, and can never come off without ſome
great recompence? But, moſt juſt Judge, I beſeech you look upon theſe Fathers of
great families, who have the whole charge of all the eſtate and houſe upon their
ſhoulders? How? their houſe? Nay of all the communaltie, or rather of the
whole Republique of the <hi>Gaules:</hi> oh Heavens! how great are their imployments?
And what a ſin it were againſt the publique good to diſturb them, or make them
loſe one minute of time? Indeed, you Fathers of families without children, and Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
without any buſineſs, we do agree with you, that you could not imploy the
time which you ſpent in thoſe trivial courtſhips, as you call them ſince thoſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nits
were ſo pretious, and uſeful to the publique, better then you did; but did you
not imploy that time with us which you ſpent in the particular converſations, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities
which you had with other Shepherdeſſes? Why did you come to us when
you had nothing elſe to do? Why ſhould we receive you when all other company
excluded you? For had it not been ſo, we ſhould never have ſeen you. If you be ſo
full of buſineſs, let Love alone: for Love is a Deity ſo great, that it is an injury unto
him to offer that time unto him which remains after the ſervice of the other Gods:
he requires the firſt offerings and the beſt of things, and if any remain, then offer
unto the other Dieties: do you think he will be contented with the refuſe and dregs
of devotion? And out of this Diſcourſe you may gather <hi>Thomantes,</hi> that it is true,
as to others, every ſeaſon has its proper actions, but not to Love; for in Loves Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
Trees do Bloom and bear fruit all at once. Do you not ſee, that Love makes
the young, as wiſe as the old; and old ones as very fools as the young? You may ſee
that there is no diſtinction of ages with him, but all of an age; did you never obſerve
that the moſt tender Flowers of Love, are moſt ſweet fruits? For what are hopes but
flowers, and hopes excel all other contentments, which one can have out of Loves
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53527:209"/>
Garden. Oh <hi>Thomantes!</hi> ignorant in Love <hi>Thomantes;</hi> know that the Fruits of
Love are Flowers, and his Flowers, Fruits: for there is alwayes contentment in
hopes, and hopes are renewed by contentments; and therefore it is that the Orange-tree

                                 <p>You ſee moſt juſt Judge, how little theſe prtended Lovers do know what Love
is; and they have good reaſon to deſire you would let them underſtand what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
is; for being ſo ignorant in Love, it is no wonder they ſhould be alſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in it; andyet, as ignorant as they are, they will maintain that they forſooth,
have obſerved all the Laws of Conſtancy to a tittle, though if they be conſtant, it is
by chance and hazard, not out of any reſolution or deſign. But if they were conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before the ſevere Throne of Love, and were asked who gave them permiſſion to
call themſelves Lovers, and aſſume unto themſelves a title ſo honourable, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the leaſt duties of a right Lover, what could they expect but a moſt ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for uſurping a name ſo much above their merit?</p>
                                 <p>Now as it is ordinary for thoſe that are guilty of any vice, to deſire that all others
may be of the ſame die, to the end they themſelves may not be upbraided, they
propound four doubts, ayming by the firſt, to tax us; by the ſecond to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and by the two laſt, to be inſtructed in what they are very ignorant. We
ſhould return them ſuch an anſwer, as they deſerve, were it not unto you, our Judg,
that they addreſs their queries, and in which we beſeech you, to inform them; not out
of any hopes to amend them for the future, but to let every one ſee, how far they are
out of the right way. And in as much as a great blunder is made about ſome letters
which were written unto them, we beſeech you, oh our Judge, to command that
thoſe Letters may be produced; for by their own confeſſion they were written only
upon common fame, and not as known truths: what then? muſt every thing, that
is taken up in the ſtreets be believed as true? Oh <hi>Thomantes!</hi> if ſuch reports may paſs
for truths, I could tell you ſtrange tales of your new affections, unto ſeveral other
Shepherdeſſes; but being only common fame, I let them paſs without belief; and
was not this example ſufficient for you to do the like. And whereas you ſay that
one ought to think nothing but virtue to be in the perſon loved; can I think that you
do love me, ſince you do thus upbraid me with levity and inconſtancy?</p>
                                 <p>Thus moſt juſt Judge, you have heard the Requeſts which theſe two Shepherds
have made unto you: and to the end it may not be ſaid, that there was ever upon
the banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> any Shepherds ſo ignorant in Love as theſe; we do add our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
alſo, that they may be forbidden to uſurp unto themſelves the honourable
name of Lover, of which they are ſo much unworthy; and for a puniſhment of their
crimes which they have committed againſt us, that they may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have the names of <hi>Doriſſea</hi> or <hi>Delphire</hi> in their memories: and that contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with having ſo long abuſed us, they may hereafter make their addreſſes ſome

they were as much intereſted in the buſineſs as any. <hi>Diana</hi> then ſitting down

                                 <p>JF the greater Lovers be the worſt ſpeakers, as that fair Shepherdeſs aſſures us
they are, then think it not ſtrange, moſt Wiſe Judge, if according to that maxime,
<hi>Filintes</hi> ſay but little of his love unto <hi>Delphire,</hi> nor of <hi>Androgentes</hi> unto <hi>Doriſſea;</hi> let
not defect of language redound unto our diſadvantage, ſince from the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
you hear, that we have loved <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Doriſſea</hi> with ſo much affection
and fidelity, as that they never found any failer in us, nor any remarkable fault.
For my part, I began to love <hi>Delphire</hi> before <hi>Thomantes</hi> had any eyes to look upon
her: and <hi>Androgenes</hi> ſerved <hi>Doriſſea,</hi> when <hi>Aſphales</hi> by his inconſtancy ſhewed
himſelf weary of that glorious ſervice. This firſt affection like to the eldeſt ſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the greateſt portion: and this laſt of <hi>Androgenes,</hi> as a ſurvivor and a worthy
ſucceſſor deſerves the eſtate; and though one of us was the firſt, and the other the
laſt, yet both of us have ever ſince we began lived in ſuch great obſervance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
that we have patiently born all thoſe favours, which before our eyes were done
unto theſe two inconſtant weather-cocks. I muſt needs confeſs that ſpleen has ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
made me conceive ſome impreſſions of anger, and made me murmure againſt
thoſe hard rigours, which that fair one made me ſuffer: but let her ſelf ſay if ſhe can,
whether in my greateſt fury, I expreſſed any action which was not all love? As ſoon
as ever ſhe caſt her eye upon me, I returned immediately unto my duty; and what
can this ſignifie, but that my affection was ſtronger then her rigour? And <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
ſeeing <hi>Doriſſea</hi> prefer <hi>Aſphales</hi> before him, he continued ſtill with ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
and fidelity, as is a moſt ſtrong argument that nothing could divert him from
this love and faithful ſervice. They ſay that the dropping of water by continuance
of time will wear the hardeſt marble, and will not a moſt conſtantly continued ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
have as great an influence upon the marble of an inſenſible heart? Muſt we be
they who muſt continually ſerve without any recompence? Muſt we ſow the ground,
and reap no Corn? Will love be ungrateful only unto us? And can they be nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly
unto us alone who have ſerved with moſt fidelity? Judge, what reaſon or
what Juſtice is in this? <hi>Androgenes</hi> and I have oftentimes comforted our ſelves with
thought, when without reaſon we ſaw theſe two Weather-cocks obtain recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in lieu of thoſe puniſhments which they deſerved, that we muſt think to fight
and ſtrive before we muſt look to overcome, and groan a long time under pain and
travel before we tryumph: but now we muſt confeſs that two things do extreamly
aſtoniſh us; the one is to ſee theſe two inconſtants, tryumph before they travelled:
and the other is, that we cannot overcome the rigour of theſe cruel ones, after ſo
much travail, and ſo long a combate: and nothing does ſtrike us into ſo much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as the pretenſions (not to ſay preſumptions) that <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>Aſphales</hi>
have to hope, nay ask as their dues, to be loved by theſe two fair ones; for if ever
love had any cauſe to revenge the wrongs which are done unto him, it is againſt
them they ought to let drive all the arrows of his juſtice, and make them exemplary
unto all ſuch as abuſe the name of Lovers. I am aſtoniſhed <hi>Thomantes,</hi> that after
you had ſo many favours from <hi>Delphire,</hi> the leaſt of which was enough to fix the
heart of <hi>Mercury;</hi> that yet, as if they had never been done unto you, you ſhould
be full of miſtruſts, full of reproches, and never ſatisfied: I cannot chuſe but admire
<hi>Aſphales,</hi> that when you went away, you went and was not loved; and that when
you returned, you ſhould be in full poſſeſſion of <hi>Doriſſeas</hi> favour: was it not ſtrange,
that meeting her eyes, and <hi>Androgenes</hi> in a glaſs, you ſhould forget ſo many favours
received, which could not be merited by you, nor any perſon in the world? But the
greateſt wonder of all is, that after you both had committed ſuch high crimes, crimes
which in Love are impardonable, you ſhould ſtill dare to ask and pretend unto the
ſame favours, and the ſame graces which you had ſo ungratefully diſdained. I am
even raviſhed with admiration to ſee you diſpute with them, and queſtion who is in
the wrong; but the wonder of all wonders is, that you durſt be ſo impudently bold
as to enquire of the Oracle, and to ſee with what confidence you preſent your ſelves
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53527:210"/>
before a Judge to demand juſtice. For if juſtice be done unto you, what leſſe can
you expect, then to be baniſhed from all places within the Dominions of Love; or
rather condemned unto all puniſhments that ungrateful wretches do deſerve. Theſe,
oh juſt Judge, are the faithful Lovers, who after they were even loadned with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and graces, did not only ungratefully fall off from thoſe ſervices, in which
they ought to have continued until death; but have even ſcorned thoſe whom they
ought to have adored; nay more, they came unto that height of ingratitude as to
ſcandal them, and contrive infamous Libels and Songs againſt them: can you ever
think that theſe fair ones will ever endure to look upon you again without bluſhes! O
ye good Gods, in what an age do we live? Muſt thoſe that ſin and wrong inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
not only eſcape puniſhments, but pretend unto recompences, and rewards?
Fie, fie, unfaithful Lovers; leave it unto <hi>Androgenes</hi> and <hi>Filintes,</hi> to ask for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
and rewards, for it is only we, that by the Laws of Love deſerve them: and
we do proteſt here before all this Company, that if <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>Aſphales</hi> be not
puniſhed for their ingratitudes and infidelities; and if on the contrary <hi>Filintes</hi> and
<hi>Androgenes</hi> do not receive recompence and wages for their affection and fidelity,
then there is no hope that within the Dominions of Love, any wrong or crime will
ever be puniſhed, or any benefit or virtue rewarded, ſince theſe higheſt degrees of
ſinners do paſſe unpuniſhed: and we without recompence or reward.</p>

                                 <p>LOve, as all things in the univerſe are, is preſerved and perfected by motion and
contrariety: and in as much as this motion cannot work upon things that are
in themſelves ſolide and ſtable without ſome exterior Agent, the motion and
agitation which can preſerve and perfect Love, which is of it ſelf firm and ſtable, and
requires another mover, and it is often times moved by jealouſie; the daughter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of Love: but a baſtard, not legitimate, and yet almoſt inſeperable. We do ſee
alſo that it is from jealouſie all theſe trivial quarrels and petty diſſentions do ariſe;
which by the ſages are called Renewings of Love: but yet it is to be underſtood, it
ought to be the Mother, but no long the Nurſe: for if ſhe ſuffer them to ſuck of
her milk too long in lieu of trivial quarrels, and petty diſſentions, they will be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into great divorces, and dangerous hatreds, which in the end will moſt undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
ſmother Love.</p>
                                 <p>Now this difference before us, betwixt <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Doriſſea</hi> on the one part;
<hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>Aſphales</hi> on another; and <hi>Filintes</hi> and <hi>Androgenes</hi> on another part,
does demonſtrate theſe ſeveral ſorts of diſſentions and divorces. For betwixt <hi>Filin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
and <hi>Delphire,</hi> appears only thoſe petty and indeed amorous diſſentions, from
which Loves takes a pleaſing and acceptable ſtrength and increaſe. Betwixt <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes</hi>
and <hi>Aſphales,</hi> towards <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Doriſſea,</hi> appears nothing but theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unions
and diſſentions, too long nouriſhed by the milk of an obſtinate jealouſie, by
which, if Love be not quite ſmothered, yet it is in the agonies of death, and gaſpes
for breath: On the contrary, one may ſee in <hi>Androgenes</hi> a patient ſufferance, which
may be ſuſpected of a little Love, without his perſeverance, and continuing to love
her.</p>
                                 <p>Theſe things being long debated, and ſeriouſly conſidered by us, unto whom the
charge is committed by the voice of the Oracle, We do declare that <hi>Thomantes</hi> and
<hi>Aſphales</hi> have tranſgreſſed againſt the Laws of Love, and againſt that duty which
they owed unto the name of Lovers, in nouriſhing ſo long theſe diſſentions by their
inconſiderate jealouſies. That <hi>Filintes</hi> and <hi>Androgenes</hi> on the contrary, have in all
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53527:210"/>
their actions ſhewed a moſt exact obſervance of all thoſe duties requiſite in real Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
And in as much as impunity of crimes, and good actions unrewarded, are
cauſes of ruine in all Eſtates and Republiques; We do ordain, by virtue of the power
which is given unto us, that all thoſe ſervices which unto this day <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phales</hi>
have rendred under the notion of Lovers and Servants, unto <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſea,</hi>
and that all the pains and inquietudes, which they have ſuffered in loving
them, be taken as nul, and as if they had never been; not pretending unto any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
or gratification for the future. And on the contrary, we do ordain, that
the ſervices which <hi>Filintis</hi> and <hi>Androgenes</hi> have rendred unto <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Doriſſea,</hi>
and all the pains, patience, and inquietudes, which they have ſuffered in loving and
courting them, ſhall remain in force and validity, and ſerve them for the future, as
of right they ought. Yet notwithſtanding, ſince repentance does almoſt by force
exact a pardon, We do ordain, that if <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>Aſphales,</hi> do really repent of
their crimes, and would love and ſerve <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Doriſſea</hi> a new, they ſhall be
obliged to receive and entertain them as new Servants and Lovers, who from this
day forward do begin to ſerve them, and to ſhew their merits. And as to the four
queries, which were put by <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>Aſphales,</hi> we do ſay by way of anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the firſt, That a Shepherdeſs may without any offence unto conſtancy, ſuffer and
permit, but not ſeek nor deſire, to be ſerved and courted by many. Unto the ſecond.
That this plurality of ſervants not ſought to nor deſired, but ſuffered only, does not
allow a Lover to have many Miſtriſſes, unleſs (which is not likely) they be ſuch as
are only ſuffered, and not deſired nor courted. Unto the third, That both the
he and the ſhe Lover, ought to live amongſt all, but unto one only; imitating in this
fair fruit upon a tree, which is looked upon and admired by many, but taſted only
by one mouth. As to the laſt, that he does go beyond the limits of conſtancy, that
does any thing which may offend the perſon loved.</p>
                                 <p>And to the end that for the future, ſuch an ignominious ignorance amongſt
Shepherds, may not be upon the banks of the River <hi>Lignon.</hi> We do will and ordain,
that the aforeſaid queſtions and reſolutions be written by <hi>Sylvander,</hi> under the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Laws of Love, to the end they may be ſeen in the Temple of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe
