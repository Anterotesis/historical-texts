            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>BEcause it looks too naked to fall immediately from Title-page to Page the First, the Reader, in lieu of Fig-leaves, or a Screen to come betwixt, is presented with a short <hi>Advertisement</hi> concerning the Nature, Powers, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of <hi>Burlesque Verse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Remarks</hi> thereupon, which the late Learned and Ingenious Sir <hi>Thomas Pope-Blount</hi> has collected from the Opinions of several Men, signifie little more than that it is not to be meddled with for fear of doing Mischief: And so it is shamefully discouraged and Brow-beaten by the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> because indeed they themselves are afraid of it.</p>
            <p>Should we suppose the Chief of our dead <hi>English Poets</hi> holding a <hi>Sessions</hi> with those who are now living, I cannot imagine where they would place the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Hudibras:</hi> To set him at the
<pb facs="tcp:50271:3"/>
Upper End of the Table, above the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Epick</hi> and <hi>Heroick,</hi> would be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; and no less so, to place him at the Bottom. In my Opinion he ought to be set, like <hi>Apemantus</hi> in the Play, at a Side-board by himself. <hi>Burlesque</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Privileges of that surly <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,</hi> no wonder if it is treated like him, but scurvily. But for the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why do not Men of the profoundest Literature and deepest Science fall foul on <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> for his ridiculing and shewing the <hi>Vanity of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;</hi> or on <hi>Solomon</hi> himself, for his Divine Book of the <hi>Ecclesiastes?</hi> But not to go too far that way, I would rather here speak of the Laws of <hi>Burlesque,</hi> (if I knew any it had:) It stands indeed upon Four Feet; but its Liberties and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are unbounded; and those Four Feet are, I think, by no means oblig'd to be but Eight Syllables; for in place of the Last, it is a part of its Excellency some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:50271:3"/>
to have Two, Three, or Four Syllables (like so many Claws) crowded into the Time of One Foot. The Duple and Triple <hi>Rhyme,</hi> in some other <hi>Poetry</hi> much bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, are Beauties in this: And <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesque</hi> esteems it no Fault, for <hi>Rymes</hi> sake, to borrow from any Language what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
            <p>Its Nature is to Ridicule, Flatter, Huff, and Banter, by turns; to Scratch and Claw now, and anon to Grin and Bite like a <hi>Satyr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ignorant of the true Reason why it is call'd <hi>Doggerel;</hi> but I know a witty young Gentlewoman, who has a small Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that way, and she calls her own <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesque, Bitcherel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is wonderful to traverse its Arbitrary Power, how it proceeds without regard to <hi>Periods, Colons,</hi> or <hi>Comma's:</hi> How some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it will change <hi>Accents</hi> for the sake of <hi>Rhyme,</hi> and, according to the most vulgar and careless Pronunciation, leave
<pb facs="tcp:50271:4"/>
out what <hi>Consonants</hi> it pleases. It will end the Verse with a <hi>Preposition,</hi> and make <hi>Interjections</hi> at its own <hi>Libitum.</hi> It often uses <hi>Grammar</hi> so ill, that it will baulk <hi>Orthography</hi> it self, rather than not assert its own Prerogative. All the <hi>Tropes, Figures,</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> in <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick</hi> bend beneath it. The <hi>Synaelepha</hi> and <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> like two Executioners, are continually waiting upon its Absolute Will and Pleasure. Refining and Polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which gives Beauty to other <hi>Poetry,</hi> spoils this: As if the <hi>Printer</hi> should leave out the Flat Nose, Goggle Eyes, Hump Back, and Distorted Limbs, and call it <hi>The Picture of Aesop.</hi> It will break a Word in Two, and gather up the latter Part of it a good while after, when one would think it was quite lost. Sometimes it goes on with a long Bead-row of <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syllables</hi> together, and esteems it no Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish; at another time, one single Word, or two at most, shall compose the whole
<pb facs="tcp:50271:4"/>
Line. Endless it would indeed be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count its various Qualifications and wild Vagaries, or to say how many different Things it is like.</p>
            <p>As true <hi>Heroick</hi> may be compar'd to a Beautiful Well-dress'd Lady, who, when she pays her Visit, lets down her Train at length, and advances with an even and graceful Motion; so <hi>Burlesque</hi> may be likened to her wanton Chamber-maid, with her Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats tuck'd up, in her Masque and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, who walks, runs, stumbles, stops, looks about, and laughs, and perhaps all in less than a Minute.</p>
            <p>Among many other Comparisons, (which are Odious) one of the worst Things <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesque</hi> may be likened to, is Mr. <hi>Bays's</hi> fierce <hi>Heroe</hi> in the <hi>Rehearsal;</hi> who frights his Mistriss, snubbs up Kings, baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles Armies, and does what he will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to Numbers, Good Manners, or Iustice: And yet after all, this frightful Thing does no more harm, when set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:50271:5"/>
proper Subjects, than Dogs that kill Vermin.</p>
            <p>If the Author of <hi>Hudibras</hi> had a right or took liberty to ridicule particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Perswasions, as he thought them faulty, sure another Man must needs have the same Privilege to expose those who are apparently mischievous to Society, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to good Establish'd Government. Though I doubt whether ever any Man will arise with so transcendent a <hi>Genius</hi> and happy Talent for this purpose, as Mr. <hi>Butler;</hi> and great Pity it was, as well as Shame, that in one respect he was suffer'd to fall so low at the last.</p>
            <p>If our <hi>Author</hi> be mistaken in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts about <hi>Burlesque,</hi> he presumes his Errors are of no dangerous Consequence; and for that Reason, is little concern'd about them. Therefore, without detaining the <hi>Reader</hi> any longer, he is desir'd to fall to the following <hi>Pages,</hi> and make the best of them.</p>
