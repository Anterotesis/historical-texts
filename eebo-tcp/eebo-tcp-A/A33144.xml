            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Duke of Devonshire, Marquiss of Hartington, Baron of Hardwick, Lord Lieutenant of the County of Darby, Lord High Steward of his Majesties House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, One of his Majesties Most Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Privy-Council, and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.</head>

            <p>THE succeeding Peice, tho' it be my first attempt in Poetry, never gave me the usual Pain, and Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice of a Young Beginner: For I knew my Reputation was as safe under the Protection
<pb facs="tcp:48541:3"/>
of so Great a Name, as my Person under your fuccessful Conduct at the time of His Majesties happy Landing to secure (what Hav'n, and Nature both oblige us to Defend) our Lives, and Liberties,</p>
            <p>Then might be seen the Trust, which ev'n Almighty Providence repos'd in you, when to your watchful Care it recommended the endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd Person of the Apparent Heir to her Late Majesties Crown, and Virtues: to such a Care as made the Thoughts of Danger Vanish. For when the Nation was Allarm'd with Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Massacres, She by your Sword was, like the <hi>Forbidden Fruit,</hi> defended, while her Faithless and unthinking Foes were driven from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48541:3"/>And tho' this Glorious Undertaking was attended with an Undaunted Courage, yet it succeeded in a Bloodless Feild; and if to save Mankind be more a God-like Virtue, than to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, Then sure the Lawrels you have so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd are more Durable, than were they dy'd in Crimson.</p>
            <p>Here I must restrain my forward Fancy, that will attempt those Truths it ne're can finish: But 'tis the Fate of Greatness, to have her Picture Common, and undertook by every Dawber, from which number I dare not exempt my self: But if I have any merit, 'tis that I have too well studied your Graces Perfections, to think my Genius capable of their Portraicture,
<pb facs="tcp:48541:4"/>
while the greatest Justice I can do them is in my si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Admiration.</p>
            <p>The same reason, I confess, ought to have deterr'd me from my following Presumption; But That's a Crime, which I can ne're repent of, since at the same time it gives me an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of declaring that Respect, and sincerity, wherewith I really am</p>
