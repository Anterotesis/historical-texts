         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Eyes upon her in moſt ſolemn manner (to beget in the reſt of the Officers (who were ready to laugh) an apprehenſion of ſome ſerious thing) fell both of them to weeping; the Witch looking in their Faces, and ſeeing them weep, fell to weeping likewiſe; and began to tell them what acquaintance ſhe had with God by Revelation, and how ſuch a Day, ſuch an Hour, after ſuch a manner ſhe had a Revelation, which ſhe was to reveal on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them; and that was, That the glorious time of ſetting up Chriſts Kingdom was near at hand, and that Anti-chriſt muſt be ſpeedily thrown down, and that they were the Inſtruments that were by God ordained to throw him down, and how they were about that great work, and that if they would proſper in it, they muſt firſt remove the KING out of the way, which they muſt do firſt by proceeding to Try him, and then to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, and then to Depoſe him, but not to put him to Death: This Relation I had from one that was ſtrongly of the Armies party, but related this ſhamefull ſtory with much indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Lillonian</hi> was taught at this time with Bribes to Print his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which was much according to the opinion of his Siſter Witch.</p>
            <p>Some of the Soberer and more Religious of the Officers being much ſtartled at theſe Revelations, but not at all ſatisfied, repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſome of the moſt Religious and able <hi>Independents</hi> to know their opinion of theſe things, and to defire advice what to do; they replyed (I am informed <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> in particular) that ſince they had gone ſo far, they muſt now carry it on, though with the Blood of thoſe that ſtood in their way, for if they now made a ſtop, farewel their Cauſe for ever: This was good in <hi>Politicks,</hi> but bad in Divinity: It was a true <hi>Politick Aphoriſm</hi> of <hi>Machiavells,</hi> but falſe Doctrine in the Divinity Schools; however they made uſe of this Doctrine to proceed in their deſigns, for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Independent Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time <hi>John Lilburn</hi> and his party, who ſate at <hi>White-hall</hi> to draw up their deſires, had brought their buſineſs to ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, which was, as I conceive, inſerted in the Paper called, <hi>The Agreement of the People,</hi> the ſum whereof, was no other then this, to Throw down <hi>KING , Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons, as then eſtabliſhed,</hi> to Throw down the <hi>Lawes, Inns of Court, Courts of Judicature, Church Government,</hi> as alſo the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> and <hi>Function of the Clergie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:168929:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>This Agreement being debated at the General Council, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> (whoſe deſign was to ſet up another Government, and was then about it) oppoſed this Agreement, becauſe it oppoſed his deſign; for though he ſate in Councel with the General Officers, yet he conſulted altogether with the Popiſh Faction, to ſet up a Government according to the Government of <hi>Spain, (viz.)</hi> by a Councel of State, and a High Court of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The General Councel of War was hereby divided about this Agreement of the people, and ſo equally divided, that onely one Voice carryed it, or two at the moſt in the Negative, which gave ocaaſion to Col. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wſon</hi> to ſay, <hi>How can we call this the Agreement of the People, when we our ſelves are divided about it? Cromwel</hi> being now to ſhoot the greateſt Gulf, having now the Work to do, which he had been all this while by force and policy making way unto; he ſaw but two main rubs in the way, which he durſt not meddle with in a boyſterous <hi>way,</hi> and thoſe were the Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Kingdom, vvho preached vehemently againſt the Treaſonable practiſes of the Army. The other whom he durſt not at this time meddle with, were thoſe down-right dealers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Levellers: What he could not do by Flattery, he did by Threats; but could not in the leaſt terrifie the Presbyterians, <hi>who</hi> declared againſt his vvicked and open Rebellion, deteſting thoſe illegal proceedings of the Army, in offering violence to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and going about to overthrow the King.</p>
