         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S a Man, or Christian, out of pure love to Mankind, I chuse
rather to cast my self at Your Lordships Feet, and come under Your greatest
Censure for this high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, than to omit so necessary a Duty and
Discovery as the substance of this discourse Imports; Therefore dare not
conceale the least inconvenience that may befall the Publique, but take bolness
to present my thoughts that Your non-apprehending the Prejudices hindring
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, nor clearely your own Capassities to remove them, and may be want
of oportunity to consult about these lesser things (though very great in
themselves (the practise whereof throughly promoted, might make the greater
more easie) compared with our weighty and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent affairs, may in some measure
be an accidentall cause that Improvements of our Lands go on no better,
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though materially the cause is in our own sloth, Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and ill
Husbandry. And though I dare not present this rude Treatise unto Your Honors,
to crave so high Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, yet I shall adventure these many most humble
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of some Prejudices to Improvements that remain founded by a
Law; And of some other Obstacles, as firmly rooted by Corruption, that without
your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors Power, and Wisdoms help therein; the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <pb facs="tcp:54116:4"/>
here tendred will be in great measure hindred.</p>
            <p>To the removall whereof, if Your Honors shall see cause to give
incouragement, either by an Addition of such Lawes as shall appear unto you
wanting, or Repealing such as hinder, I shall not question but mens spirits
will be raised to such Experimenting of the principles of Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, as that
wee may see this Common-wealth soon rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to her utmost fruitfullness and
greatest glory.</p>
            <p>The particulars here are too many here to discourse at large; I
shall therefore take boldness to present some few with some brief reasons to
evince the same; and they are very great discouragements to the Ingenuous and
Active Prosecution of the Improvements of the Nation.</p>
            <p>The first Prejudice is, That if a Tenant be at never so great
paines or cost for the improvement of his Land, he doth thereby but occasion a
greater Rack upon himself, or else invests his Land-Lord into his cost and
labour <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> or at best lies at his Land-Lords mercy for requitall;
which occasions a neglect of all good Husbandry; to his own, the Land, the
Land-Lord, and the Common-wealths suffering. Now this I humbly conceive may be
removed, if there were a Law Inacted, by which every Land-Lord should be
obliged, either to give him reasonable allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for his clear Improvement, or
else suffer him or his to enjoy it so much longer as till he hath had a
proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable requitall: As in <hi>Flanders</hi> and else where, in hiring
Leases upon Improvement, if the Farmer Improve it to such a Rate above the
present value, the Land-Lord gives either so many years purchase for it, or
allowes him a part of it, or confirms more time; of which the Tenant being
secured, he would Act Ingenuity with violence as upon his own, and draw forth
the Earth to yeeld her utmost fruitfullness, which once being wrought unto
perfection, will easily be maintained and kept up at the height of <pb facs="tcp:54116:4"/>
fruitfullness, which will be the Common-wealths great advantage: Some Tenants
have Advanced Land from Twenty pounds to Forty pounds <hi>per an,</hi> and
depending upon the Land-Lords favour have been wip'd of all; and many Farmers
by this uncertainty have been impoverished and left under great disgrace, which
might as well have been advanced.</p>
            <p>The second Prejudice is against that great Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by
floating Lands, which exposeth the Improver to sute of Law for Turning a
Watercourse, by Millers or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which are minded to molest the Improvement,
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Improvement be ten fold greaer than the Prejudice can be, and the
Advantage be far more publique than the others pretended loss can be, yet few
dare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon the work, for fear of being sued or molested.</p>
            <p>Many great Improvements have been, and are to this day hindred and
ly dead because the Miller cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with at any rate; some I know,
whose Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might be Ten-fold and more, the Millers Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice little,
if any at all, because your exact husbands so clear all their boggy, low parts,
and some time by their large draines break through many springs and issuing
wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they carry a better stream unto the Miller than he had before,
and his Improvement shall be able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a great part of the Country with
Hay and Grass, where was before but little, and may be the Millars mill may be
worth five or six pound <hi>per an.</hi> few worth ten, that usually stand upon
these waters, and let him be damnified what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he can, it is in no
proportion to the Common wealths loss to such an Improvement.</p>
            <p>The third Prejudice is, where all mens Land lie inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed in
Common Fields or Meddowes; The Ingenuous are disabled to the Improving theirs,
because others will not, neither sometimes can the Improvement be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 
<pb facs="tcp:54116:5"/> any, unless upon all joyntly, or else upon an unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potable Charge
or Burthen. As also the not cutting straight such watercourses, of such brookes
and gutters that are exceeding crooked, which some that would cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of others interests that will not, abundance of the best land in this Nation is
hereby lost, and wonderfull Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements hindered, the waters raised, the
lands flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, sheep rotted, and cattell spoyled, all by this neglect.</p>
            <p>The remedies to all the three aforesaid Prejudices, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the greatest advantage to the Common-wealth, and then command them either unto
a loving Conjunction in the Exchange and Improvement, or else disabling any one
to hinder another that is desirous of it, giving such recompence for any
dammage he shall make, as shall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged reasonable by indifferent men, or
competent Judges.</p>
            <p>A Fourth is Unlimited Commons, or Commoning without stint, upon
any Heath, Moor, Forrest, or other Common; This is a great Prejudice to many
poor men, both Cottiers and Land-Holders, who have not of their own to stock
their Commons, and so lose all, that have least need, and for whom those
Commons were chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: And also a great hindrance to all; for being
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, every man laies on at random, and as many as they can get, and
so Overstock the same, that ordinarily they pine and starve their Goods
therein; and once in four or five yeares you shall observe such a Rot of Sheep,
that all that the Oppressor hath gained by eating out his poor Neighbours all
the other years, is swept away in one, and so, little advantage redoundeth to
any: So that many thousand Acres of Land are as it were useless, which were all
men limited according to their Proportion of Land or Dwellings to which the
Common is due, the poor that could not stock theirs, might set them, and reap
some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit <pb facs="tcp:54116:5"/> by them: And were they easily stinted, their
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons might be as good as their own Severals to every man that hath an
interest.</p>
            <p>A Fifth Prejudice is, A Law wanting to compell all men to kill
their Wonts or Moales; the good Husband doth, and the slothfull man neglects
it, and thereby raiseth such a Magazine or Nursery, that they cannot be
destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as fast as one destroies them, the other nurseth a fresh spply
to fill the Country: the Prejudice is greater than can be reported.</p>
            <p>The sixt Prejudice is the not compelling men to plant Wood where
they do cut down, then to set again a treble proportion or more to what they do
destroy, especially now so much of the gallant Wood of the Nation is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to sale: We forget that it is a mighty pillar in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding this poor
Island, and how honorable a custom it is in other Nations, that look what
Timber they cut down, they must plant five or ten times as much in stead
thereof: And that all men might be compelled to plow their coar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, old mossy,
rushy, bankie pasture Lands, being now fittest for it and will be bettered by
it, and suffers for want of it, and the Country needs it, and none prejudiced:
and for the best land every man left to his own liberty.</p>
            <p>A Seventh Prejudice is the want of a through searching of the
Bowels of the Earth, a business more fit to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the Honourable
Representation of the whole Common-wealth, than by any particular man; Whence
are all our Mines of Lead, Tinne, Iron, Coales, and Silver Mines in
<hi>Wales,</hi> were they not once hid, and as uncertain as we are now certain
of them? and what should hinder but that in many places else the like may be
discovered? as suppose Coal in <hi>Northampton, Buckingham,</hi> and <hi>Oxf.
Sh.</hi> what a great benefit to those Countries would it be? Nay, if some
sorts of Stone could bee but found out in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb facs="tcp:54116:6"/> parts, what
might it arise unto? Nay, say that either Marl, Chalk, or Lime, or some other
fat Earth could be found in some other parts where they are wanting, how much
would it inrich those parts? And who can say but Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may as well be found
in other places as in <hi>Wales</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts? I am sure that no man
knowes but he that hath searched it, and the hundred thousand part of this
Nation hath never yet been tryed.</p>
            <p>The Eighth Prejudice may be the many Watermills, which destroy
abundance of gallant Land, by pounding up the water to that height, even to the
very top of the ground, and above the naturall height, that it lyeth swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and soaking, and spewing, that it runneth very much land to a Bogg, or to mire,
or else to Flagg and Rush, or Mareblab, which otherwise was as gallant land
naturally as could be, I am confident many a thousand a year are thus
destroyed, some mills worth above 10 or 12. pound <hi>per an.</hi> destroy
lands worth 20. 30. or 40. <hi>per. an.</hi> I know it of my own knowledge, I
had some few yeares since a Mill Dam in my land which destroyed one half of a
gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant meaddow, meanes was used that it was removed, and that very land is
returned to his perfect pureness again.</p>
            <p>I prescribe not the utter destruction of all, of some I do, and
others to have their water brought to a lower gage, and where they are wanting,
Wind-mills erected, as in all the Fen Country are no other, or else
incouragement given to some that I am confident are able to discover a
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat way for grinding all sorts of Corn by the strength of horse and man
as feasible as malt is. I am able to give some assistance my self to this work,
but shall far prefer others thereto, A Gentleman that hath waded so deeply
therein as hath discovered publiquely his modell at <hi>Lambeth</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth
great incouragement.</p>
            <p>And the last though not the least is the raign of many <pb facs="tcp:54116:6"/> abominable Lusts, as Sloth and Idleness, with their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Drunkenness, Gaming, Licentious Liberty. Were not the greatest and best, and
all men made to be usefull to the body? why continue many men as members cut
off from it, as if they were made to consume it, are neither usefull in their
bodies, minds, or purses to the common good? how comes City and Country to be
filled with Drones and Rogues, our highwaies with hackers, and all places with
sloth and wickedness? I say no more but pray some quickning Act to the
execution of our Lawes against these worse than heathenish Abhominations.</p>
            <p>All which, with many more great annnoyances and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusances
(though some may think every man will be ready to remove, but we being under
such a drowsie Age, that though each particular shall be advantaged as well as
the whole body, yet it will not be indeavored as far as I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to see into
mens minds or practices) are no way possibly removeable, but by Your Honours
either compelling them by acting Ingenuity themselves, or else so incouraging
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are desirons thereof, that None may Prejudice Improvements, by
denying any liberty for carrying on the Work, receiving reasonable satisfaction
for the Dammage. To which if your Honours please to add but one thing more, to
give your best incouragements to all ingenious honest-hearts, some such there
are that have more within them than they can express, and many such you need,
and the Common-wealth more, whom while you are carefull to countenance, from
Hucksters and Impostors, God will either keep you or inable you to discover,
but if any one can make A clear discovery of any new Invention for the advance
of Lands, Trade or Merchandize, If your Honours please to confirm it to him for
a season, to reinburse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a little, it being unconceivable what some
Ingenuous men run themselves out herein, I cannot see the least Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice 
<pb facs="tcp:54116:7"/> to any, but a great incouragement to all, nor can I have the least
glance homeward, though plain dealing be a jewell, I finding my poor plain
principles will never reach the honour of an intire discovery, if I can either
draw any thing to life out of the deep judgements or opinion of the more
learned, and have out any thing to a profitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment from my own
practice, and hereby gain oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to cast it as a Freewill Offering into
the Common Wealths Treasury, as the best and all I have to give, is my utmost
Emulation. All which humble Proposals, though Unbeseeming me to present, yet a

               </gap>lar additionall waies of Improvement I promised to discover,
present them all unto thee if God shall please to assist it to the
Compleatment; wherein I shall a little by way of Reparation in some parts
underbuild, and some lean to, or less necessary, quite pull down of the old
work, and yet not deface it neither, although by my hands it will never be
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, onely may be wholsome and keep warm in Winter: I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
forbear to mention here any of the particulars therein handled, but refer thee
to the Book it self; yet shall let them know (besides some illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations upon
some of the former passages) I shall clear my promise in all particulars as to
the Land Improvement, &amp; give in as clear as a discovery of the Tooles as I
can in their severall figures. And by way of Addition, or as second part, I
shall hold forth how thou maiest make great, and may be greater Improvements
than have as yet been usually made in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> upon thy Lands divers
other waies.</p>
            <p>As First, in the Mystery of <hi>Planting</hi> all sorts of fruits,
with the speediest raising them to perfection.</p>
            <p>Secondly I shall endeavour the facilitating the great weight and
burthen of the Plough, and give you the description of some formes most
suitable unto ease and speed, and hope thereby to take off a considerable
strength and charge from the Husbandmans daily toil.</p>
            <p>

Hemp and Flax, Rape and Cole-seed, Oad, Hops, Saffron, Licorish, and some other

            <p>Fourthly, I shall endeavour to discover by what meanes we may
possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble raise the benefit of the Clover grasse. <hi>St. Foine La-lucerne</hi>
to the nearest president to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> for worth
and quality, as our English climate and best husbandly experience will
admit.</p>
            <p>And Lastly, shall take boldness, with my good friend M.
<hi>Samuell Hartlips</hi> leave, to paraphrase a little upon most of those
deficiencies in husbandry which his friend charges us withall, of which we have
more than a good many, and not so few as he speakes of, and reduce so many of
them that I have not spoke to already in my first Edition, unto Practicall
husbandry that fall under any of my experiences (which though they bee but
coarse and mean, yet have been gained hardly, by many toilsome tedious
Iourneyes, and very great and large expences) and for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light and
help to the clear understanding of the Mystery of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement (for so I call
it, and so it will be found when thou commest to the reall practise of it, and
may be more mysterious then thy princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, customes, and experience will
reach unto) I would direct thee a little to consider, what hath been written in
this kind by former gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Instruments worthy of perpetuall honour. Mr.
<hi>Markham</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently for his time, so did Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> in
his Husbandry; Mr. <hi>Tusser</hi> rimes out his experiences to good purpose,
and in all their bookes thou maist find out many things worth thy observation.
Sir <hi>Francis Bacons</hi> Naturall History is worthy high esteem, it is full
of rarities and true Philosophy. Sir <hi>Hugh Plats Adams</hi> art revived is
of good report, I never yet could gain the sight of it, though Mr <hi>Gabrell
Plats</hi> discovery of hidden Treasure is very ingenuous, and could'st thou
but fathom his corn-setting Engine, and clear it to thine own and others
apprehensions, it would be of excellent use without question: but for the
Country Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Translated out of French, with some two or three other little
books, I can find but little Edification or Addition to our own English
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, what other men can find out of them I know not, but leave to thee
to discover, but for the rest they have been a great and clear light to our
Horizon: yet among some of them, one is worthy reprehension, which is their
large observations of season, signes and planets, forgetting God the maker of
them and blesser of all things, as if Seeds, Herbs and Plants were to be sowen
in the Moon or Planets, which should they be observed <pb facs="tcp:54116:8"/> they had
need produce a double profit, because not half of any would be sow'd or
planted: These times have let in so much light as will discover the vanity
hereof. But I must not forget Mr <hi>Samuell Hartlips</hi> peeces lately put
forth as discoveries made to him of great advancements o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries have
made unto themselves thereby, both which in some particulars are naturall, and
suitable, and experimentall in this Nation, and of great advantage, and merit
high esteem from all, and in other particulars I know not but why most of them
also may be so applied and experimented too, as to raise a good, commendable,
and profitable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage if they fall into the hands of ingennous husbandry. I
have therefore endeavoured to make my thoughts as legible as I can concerning
them, as well as all other the aforesaid, though not to so good purpose as I
should, yet to provoke the more Ingenuous to correct them to their own
advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, although I shall render my self subject to various opinions, and
though doggs bark I pass not, if the Ingenuous Reader will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn before
hearing; my design shall not be to contend against former mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, New
discoveries will admit some of them; but I shall perswade all men to a thorough
triall of what they fiud most probably advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto them: And what by my
self shall be here held forth are most of them experimented to thy hand at my
proper cost and charge without the assistance of any other purse or person,
&amp; so visible that thy own eyes shall be thy Iudges, and the rest shall be
so clearly held forth by irrefragable demonstration and evident conviction of
the places where, and the persons by whom, as thou needest not scruple; it is
time, the world is full of conceits and phantasies, nor can my self challenge
immunity there from; yea reason it self hath neer beguiled me till Experience
hath conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the question: And there is a naughty generation of men that
have brought an ill report upon Ingenuity through their pretences of great
abilities in Enginreeship, and great experience of raising and drawiug water,
floating lands, oyling corn, advising strange compositions for Seed and Land,
pretending great advantages by Chimistry, yet have or could not bring forth the
fruit of their great undertakings, some through want of meanes to accomplish
their work, not wisely forecastiug at first what it would cost; others indigent
in their principles, having seen or done something, therefore thought they
could doe all things; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers through a base spirit of deceit, and may be
some for want of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to try the issue: all which have brought a scandall
upon Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Though I verily beleeve much may be done by many of the
afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <pb facs="tcp:54116:9"/> meanes, and more will be discovered by unthought of
waies, many men having so good inventions and very able to advise great things
for the Common-wealth advantage, yet may not be able of themselves to bring
forth the same to publique experience; such may and do deserve some publique
incouragement. A base privacy of Spirit hath so tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us that few can
vouchsafe publique service any publique honour, nor publique Instruments a
publique recompence: Yet still look thou out to duty, charge not Ingenuity as
an innovation, but act vigorously in thy station; good husbandry is as the
sinnews and marrow that holds toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the joynts of common good; all
workmanship without Invention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves it self into the workmans belly; for
though a new world hath been of late discovered, yet there is not an occupation
or trade of finding them, nor are our English people very active in searching
after them; Study Improvements, which though they may not be said to be either
Father or Mother to Plenty, yet it is the Midwife that facilitates the birth.
See what shiftings people make for livelihood, how many severall callings doe
men make, and yet unmake the main: The exereising these projections accompanied
with a blessing (if I may so call them without offence) will open a way to the
relief of thousands. The Common-wealth is low, and misery and penury will
follow if we do not rouze the sluggard, and post after Industry, pursue all
advantages of Improvement whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: It is a great argument to quicken me to
the more speedy publication of this third Edition, &amp; the rest of the new
additions to it; &amp; though I here hold forth most of my own experiences,
&amp; may be said to be a Trumpeter of my own praise, yet if thou wilt but
consider, First, that many of these particulars have been wrought as particular
Rules or instructions to private friends as my own experiences, &amp; to alter
them will make so great an alteration in the whole, as my present occasions wil
not suffer. And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because I find so great abuse by some mens high
affirmations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but conjectures, as hath brought Ingenuity under the
scandal of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects &amp; new devises, which men will scorn to deem them so
when they are made experiments. And thirdly, because the subject, though poor
&amp; plain to be discoursed, and great proof made thereof to good perfection,
yet when thou commest to the thorough practise thereof, thou shalt find it so
ambiguous, as not withstanding, all my allusions to my own experience will be
little enough, and then thou wilt excuse me. And could the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour have been
thus supplied, it is great odds whether this Peece had rendered it self unto
the hazzard of acceptance or disgrace in so rude <pb facs="tcp:54116:9"/> a manner; I
should have added much more, but that the Epistle might have swelled into a
volume, and therefore chose rather to divide what I had to have spoke to the
particular rankes of men whom it most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes, and so have distributed to
each a portion as I conceived most sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to work their spirits into a
flexibleeness of practise and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which if they set unto
experimenting, I hope they will raise such fruit thereby, as to witness to, or
be Credentialls of my Frontispeece.</p>
            <p>Although I indeavour so mainly to work my Improvements out of the
Belly of the Earth, yet am I neither of the Diggers mind, nor shall I imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
their practice, for though the poor are or ought to have advantage upon the
Commons, yet I question whether they as a society gathered together from all
parts of the Nation could claim a right to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Common: And for
their prastice, if there be not thousands of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more capable of
Improvement than theirs, and that by many easier waies, and to far greater
advantages, I will lay down the Bucklers: Nor shal I countenance the Level
principles of Parity or Equality, which they seem to urge from the begining,
till I see the heads of Families and Tribes, Iudges and Governors, Lords and
Princes of whole Countries, blotted out of the first or succeeding generation;
unless they bring us to the new <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or bring it down to us,
when we shall not need to trouble our selves about greater or lesser, or any
distinction of person, places, or estates, any more, but this Parity is all I
endeavour, to make the poor rich, and the rich richer, and all to live of the
labour of their own hands. And thus clearly demonstrating what I have
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, I hold my self disobliged in all my promises, except in this which
will be fitter to be presented in a Volume of it self, after some good proof
given to the world of thy industry in improving thy lauds, viz. Some speciall
directions when thy Lands are improved, how to use them or stock them to the
best advantage of the Common-wealth and thy profit, and therein shall indeavour
these five or six particulars, First to hold forth the best way or meanes of
breeding or rearing all sorts of cattle, sheep, beasts, or Horse. Secondly, to
shew the way of Cow-keeping, Dayrying, or raising most Cheese aud Butter. And
thirdly the waies of Grazing and feeding all sorts of Cattell; All which are
three staple Advantages of the Nation, and will hold hands with Tillage,
Corning, Trade, and Merchandize; and shall add, Fourthly how to raise a great
advantage out of Goates and Conneys, for your har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der stocking Lands, and some
two or three more particulars, that thou <pb facs="tcp:54116:10"/> maiest not be wanting in
the usage of thy land as well as in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it, and it shall strive
excedingly to dismystery them all; and in the fift and last place shall
proportion all with the most suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I can to those severall lands by
which they may advance the highest profit and greatest increase, and all as
largely and plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, as I am able. </p>

            <p>1 Because of the gooness and welcomness of a Calm after a Storm,
no less will be a setled Peace after so great a War, and a little breathing
will recover strength and spirits.</p>
            <p>2 Because you need not fear want of good Imployment afterward:
This piece will open many doores for that, and I am confident Activity and
Ingenuity will much inlarge our Quarters, and make this Nation
<hi>Rehoboth,</hi> and with good husbandry indeed would more comfortably
maintain hundreds of thousands more than are allready born, and I hope you will

            <p>3 And lastly, because your selves are interested and possessed of
many lands, and those such too as will admit of great <hi>Improvement</hi> with
wise management, and some of them as great as by this discourse is here
proposed, and though you may conceive your late lands designed for your pay
were highly surveied, and to all advantages to raise them, yet those advantages
of Improvement were not to be considered, nor indeed could be discovered by
them which understood them not; nor was any of them purchased at any other rate
than the present va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to be then set and let to present Tenants; which Lands
are as full of vast Improvements as any lands in <hi>England:</hi> for all
which causes I need press no more, but in the honour I bear to a Souldiers
name, which God himself hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by stiling himself a Man of War,
although I take no pleasure in War, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise <pb facs="tcp:54116:11"/> than in submission
to Gods will, and the accomplishment thereof, which is not to be resisted or
repined at for the satisfaction of our inclination to ease, peace, or rest;
upon this account or any other, I beseech you (so long as necessities command
you to it) to preserve alway a good Conscience within; for although hopes of
Victory without may carry man through great hardships, yet your peace with God
reaches up to heaven, and cannot be scaled with Ladders, nor undermined with
batteries, being founded upon a Rock, nor starved with famine, a good
Conscience being a continuall Feast. Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his holy War gives
this description of a good souldier, That he that is most couragious in War, is
quiet and painfull in Peace, and comfortably betakes himself to his calling:
The wiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the sword hath not made his Spirit unwieldy for his private
Calling. And I having this opportunity to distribute this mean peece unto the
World, thought good to offer a Portion amongst you the Honourable Souldiery, as
for Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how you may turn Improvers too, also humbly to desire your
assistance in the work so far as in you lieth, to remove some grievances and
Impediments of the Common-wealths advantage, largely discovered in the other
Epistles, which brevity causes me to omit, and so no more but humbly pray you
study how to serve your present generation in extolling Gods glory,
endeavouring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-good, and in the interim abandon privacy of spirit.
Remember Christs Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, view the promised Land, and rejoyce to think of

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O you of all others I might spare thit paines, you the very
practitioners, you that trade in Husbandry, of some of you I have high things
to report, both for your industry and activity; and though I am confident all
men are thirsty enough after profit and increase, yet few studiously
industrious in this design; though some esteem it matter of greatest moment,
yet you will not all be found patronizers hereof; there is such a scandall and
prejudice among many of you against new projections, that I shall beseech you
to take a loving ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition in two or three particulars, The first is an
Epidemicall disease (and little less are the succeeding) and it is a great
mischief to your selves and the Common-wealth, and that is such an immoderate
plowing your land; some plow far more than they can Til or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, and others
all they have in common, though never so much, others plowing so oft and low,
that they draw out the marrow of it, and these are the great Improverishers of
your gallant old pasture, though fit enough to plow, &amp; might be best
advanced thereby with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but into both these extremes men are so apt
to run so fast, that I desire to stop their course a little, and shall make
bold to tell them, that when half or one third part of so much land as many of
you Till, shall with that very soyl, and half the labour and seed saved, yeeld
you as much corn as all that great quantity scramblingly husbanded, that then
you are ill husbands; which you wil confess if that you wil but grant me that
which no man wil deny, that one Acre purely husbandryed (and what need any be
otherwise, or any break up more than he is able well to compass) will be as
good as two or three in many mens ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, but in some of your
whole-sale husbandmen that plow all before them, four or five A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres will not
ballance one purely husbanded, then judge so much land preserved from
impoverishment, so much seed and cost preserved, and yet as great increase,
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the opposite actors be not enemies to themselves, families and
Common-wealth. The second abuse is want of good tillage, wee lose our hopes
excedingly by this; and herein we must both have respect to season, land, and
corn; for good seasons at all times cannot be expected, yet of two evills chuse
the least. I am confident better sometimes lose the land, than land, seed, and
all your labour, as many do that outslip the season: but for prevention, begin
earlier; I am confident though it may admit of some inconveniencies some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
yet at other times it is out of question, but generally both Summer and Winter
seed-time carries it away, sure it hath these advantages, that if it prosper
not, you may sow it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or if the latter part of seed time at Michaelmas
time prove wet, you are well, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sowed before, or the latter part of
seed-time in the Spring prove dry, as most oft it doth, you have prevented
that, and what is the great danger of growing proud in Winter, that is to mee a
vertue, and if in the Spring, it is easily taken down also; and if thou fearest
weeds, I am of opinion that the stronger and thicker any corn is, it preserves
it self the best from weeds; but there is a Medium in all things, too thick
sowing may be as bad, but this ever observe, that the earlier thou sowest, the
thinner thou maiest sow thy winter corn, and summer too, if the season be good,
and land dry and sound: And secondly, to your land you must have respect too,
Land in good tilth, in good heart and sound, in a good sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, will out-cast
its very marrow, through the Lords blessing expect fruit enough: Men much wrong
their corn in not giving their Lands sufficient workmanship, I am not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise 
<pb facs="tcp:54116:14"/> in the number of Plowing nor Harrowing, but just so much and no
more than preserves the Land from weedes, and best brings the land into such a
composition that your land mould well. I shall not justify the old Proverb,
here, No balkes no corn, I say not balkes, all corn, even cleanly plowing is
most commendable and most profitable; to some grain more til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, to some less
is required, yet to none no less than may both cover well and yield good
bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome and rooting to the Corn. And thirdly for your Corn, some graines
require more tillage, others less; some will better beat a drier season, some a
wetter; some grain more subject to one weed than to another, some grain wil do
best with two summers, and others with one: In all which consider and advise
thy self as much as thou canst of the nature of them all, and make out what
experiences thou canst thy self, and somewhat incline to the most ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
usage and custome of thy Country. In some cases a good custome is instructive;
but I'll be brief here, that I may be a little larger elsewhere following. The
fourth and last abuse is a calumniating and depraving every new Invention; of
this most culpable are your mouldy old leavened husbandmen, who themselves and
their forefathers have been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to such a course of husbandry as they
will practise, and no other, their resolution is so fixed, no issues or events
whatsoever shall change them, if their neighbour hath as much corn of one Acre
as they of two upon the same land, or if another plow the same land for
strength and nature, with two horses and one man, as well as he, and have as
good corn, as he hath been used with four horse and two men, yet so he will
continue: Or if an Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be discovered to him and all his neighbours,
hee'l oppose it and degrade it; What for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth saith he, who taught you more
wit than your forefathers, would they have neglected so great advantage if
there had been any? they kept good hospitality, and made shift to breed up many
children, &amp;c. and I know not what simple chaff to blind themselves; this
proud un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachable spirit an ingenious man abhorrs, which banes and poysons the
very plenty of our Nation. These prejudices both upon your minds and practises
which boult you out from wealth and glory, my dear friends and fellow
husbandmen, I pray you lay aside, and doe but in charity walk with me a little
through this discourse, and I shall hope to satisfy that there is no other end
but common good proposed, The poor, thy posterity, and all Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest advantage
here intended by him that is as studious of thine, the Common wealths

 more excellent, the more ancient, and nearer it comes to God, the first being
 of all things, which as all things nearest the Center move more strongly, so
 all Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency appeares most evidently, the nearer (if I may speak with
 reverence) to that great Majesty, the great Husbandman, God himself. First in
 his making the world, hee made all Creatures, and all Plants, Fruits, Trees,
 Herbs, and all bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Seed, for the food of Man and Beast; He also made those
 more excellent and glorious Creatures, as the Light, the Day, and Night, the
 Firmament, the Earth, and Seas, the Sun, Moon, and Starrs, all to be
 serviceable, and ministers unto the Creatures relief, and all the Creatures
 subservient to Man, and Man to Husbandize the fruits of the Earth, and dress,
 and keep them for the use of the whole Creation.</p>
                  <p>So God was the Originall, and first Husbandman, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of
 all Husbandry, and first projector of that great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, to bring that old
 Masse and Chaos of confusion unto so vast an Improvement, as all the world
 admires and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists from. And having given man such a Patern both for 
 <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54116:16"/> precept and president for his incouragement, he makes him
 Lord of all untill the fall; And after that God intending the preservation of
 what he made, notwithstanding the great curse upon <hi>Adam,</hi> Eve, and
 Serpent, the Earth not going free, but a curse of Barrennesse cast upon it
 also, yet <hi>Adam</hi> is sent forth to till the Earth, and improve it, <hi>In

                  </p>

 Scripture,<note place="margin">Prov. 12. 20.</note> where all experience holds it
 so clear, is but to prove a principle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain-said; I'll say no more. But for
 the usefulnesse of it, it's no lesse than the maintenance of our Lives,
 Estates, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and world, and the Improvement, or Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
 of the fruits and profits of the Earth by Ingenuity, is little less than an
 addition of a new world; for what is gained hereby either above the naturall
 fruitfulnesse of the Earth, or else by reducement of that which is destroyed,
 or impoverished from his naturall fruitfulness, to greater fertil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is a
 clear augmentation or Addition to the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>All other callings proceeding hence, the Earth being the very
 womb that beares all, and the Mother that must nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and maintain all. The
 Merchant is a gallant servant <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54116:16"/> to the State, he fetches it
 from farre, and tis a gallant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richment to this Nation; but he purchaseth it
 from others, who could make good profit of it, if he buy it not, raiseth it not
 out of nothing, but parts with good Silver, or Gold, or some good commodity for
 it, and is a great Common-Wealths advantage.</p>
                  <p>But this Merchant of Husbandry, he raiseth it out of the
 Earth, which otherwise would yeeld little, unless this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity fetch it out,
 possibly never discovered to be there. And what parts he with? or at what rates
 purchaseth he it at? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven onely with the wages of the labouring man, whom he
 is bound both by the Law of God, Nature, and the Land, to maintain, who may be
 were he not maintained in work would cost as much to be maintained idly. Oh!

                  <p>1 In Man himself it was occasionally, who by his sin procured
 a curse upon the Land, even Barrennesse <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54116:17"/> it self, which by
 the sweat of his browes must be reduced, if he will eat bread, and so now
 is.</p>
                  <p>2 In man naturally, which is the main and capitall cause of
 all,<note place="margin">1 Cause of Barrenness is ignorance oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioning
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</note> and is in him as I conceive the Cause of Causes, which is
 Ignorance, occasioning the prejudice men bear against Improvement, especially
 that which is not of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising, as all men naturally hate the true
 light of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it discovers their darkness, and is contrary to their
 light, which is that of Nature and Reason onely, the great enemies of Gospell
 Light. So that parallel hereunto in some measure, is the hatred that many bear
 to any new Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous discovery of that which is not under their ken or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
 practise, unlesse they can make it their own contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ariseth from
 old <hi>Adams</hi> proud nature so rooted in ours, that wherein we cannot
 ascribe unto our selves the praise, we had rather lose the profit, and so
 presently decry the same, Saying, This is no other but a principle of some
 young Brainsick, or of one that would Monopolize more to his ten, twenty, or
 thirty yeares study and experience, than our fathers and fore-fathers attained
 in all their practices; or else some giddy head that will say more in half an
 hours discourse, than he will make good proof of in an Age; or else it is an
 experiment that will cost more than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits thereof will countervail; or
 else the Improvement is so great that they cannot possibly credit such
 Impossibilities, with innumerable more such passages; never putting forth their
 Mindes, Hands, or Purses, to never so great and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable an advantage,<note place="margin">Prov. 4. 15.</note> like the Sluggard, who will not plow,<note place="margin">Prov. 36. 13.</note> but saith, <hi>A Lion is in the way.</hi> And
 so, by feeding upon these or such like Prejudices, they suffocate their own
 unspeakable advantage, which they might accomplish with setting on the work,
 and exercising a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in waiting for a through triall. Although Ile
 say it should be our rejoycing when any discovery is made, (chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God)
 &amp; then of that which shall concern the publique good, be the instrument
 what he will, and not ingaged therein for meer advantage only, as too many have
 done, holding forth specious Pretences of great wonders, and the 
 <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54116:17"/> condition hath ever been great gain to the discoverer, and
 more than the worth of the discovery many times hath been; yet if the naked end
 be the Publick good, be the discovery what it will, or the Discoverer conceived
 neither of so deep a head, nor of so long experience, as others have been, yea,
 though thou conceive it a Project so chargeable, that will not answer the cost
 bestowed, or an advance so great as is not credible, yet consider if he utter
 Reason, Art, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, and especially where he offereth experience for the
 proof thereof, have thou patience to consider thereof, if thou wilt not make
 triall of it, his is the paines, and if to any, it is thy Gaines, he hath but
 his labour for his travell.</p>
                  <p>The second Hindrance as in respect of the owner, or occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
 thereof,<note place="margin">2. Cause is Improvidence and a slavish
custome.</note> is Idleness, Improvidence, and a slavish Custome of some old
 form, or way of Husbandry, exercised therein ever since they were born, which
 begets so much the ill Husbandry of these dayes, never affecting Ingenuity in
 any particulars of their Husbandry, which is contrary to the mind and will of
 God in making us, and the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were made, Good husbandry
 commanded, and so experimented by God himself, and charged on us therein, and
 so commended by <hi>Solomon</hi> the wisest of men, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and
 Activity, to the putting out the utmost of our spirits, in subordination to our
 spirituall calling, in our particular callings to serve our generations, and
 improve our Principles for the common good, which two aforesaid causes if they
 be not removed, will never admit of the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of the subsequent causes.</p>
                  <p>A third particular cause in man of the Earths unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
 is want of severe punishment of Idleness,<note place="margin">3. Cause is want of
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Idleness, and want of Stock to set the poor on work.</note> the
 Mother, and Drunkenness, the Daughter, or the putting in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such
 good and wholsome Lawes as both God and man have provided therein; As also not
 raising stocks in all Countries, as a Magazine or treasury of work, and labour,
 for those that want it; And those other Lawes for punishing of Rogues and
 Vagrants, that wander the Country, and compelling and constraining youth, and
 idle people, to some callings, All which would both put them on to more
 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, <pb n="8" facs="tcp:54116:18"/> and the Gentry, and Yeomanry of the Nation
 would be much induced to Invention, and expatiating themselves in charge and
 treasure, to maintain them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by these horrid sinnes of Idleness, Lust, and
 Laciviousness would be checked, and those Drones, and Caterpillars, the bane of
 a Christian State, and shame of a Christian Nation, would not so swarm amongst
 us. It is a crying sin of our Nation,<note place="margin">A Crying sin,</note> I
 pray God charge it not upon us, lest as we have already smarted for it, we
 smart not now at last to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. So that were but these Improvements put into
 Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, their great plea would be silenced <hi>(viz) VVill you set us on
 work? we will work if you'll provide it? &amp;c.</hi> (and out of all question)
 the capacities of the Nation herein, are farr more than here be labouring men
 to act them: and so as they conceive, they justifie their Abomination, both by
 necessity and authority.</p>
                  <p>As for Drunkenness the Daughter,<note place="margin">Drunkenness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> which so aboundeth every where, that I
 verily believe, and fear not to make it forth, by reason, and experience, that
 were it the Daughter, with Idleness the Mother, suppressed in this Nation, wee
 need never to fear want or penury. I know divers Towns in this land, where you
 shall have two or three poor Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, wickedly, and wastfully, devour more
 Mault, than all the Freeholders, Labourers, and Inhabitants besides. And judge
 you, Labouring Countrie people for the most part brew their own Beer also,
 neither is there any passage, or Road-way through the Townes where these
 private houses of resort are, and yet these to vent so much Beer or Ale, is
 wonderfull! How much then is consumed in great Passages, common Roads, great
 Towns, Markets, or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wastfully and wickedly, if so much be in Corners
 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and not thought of? so that were there a suppression hereof, how would
 Idleness be abashed? men would scarce stand idle in open wayes, or passages,
 for shame, wife and children enjoy their Fathers, and Husbands at home, if
 do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little, yet not consuming that they have got already, and the Markets
 more full, and plentifull of corn so miserably wasted; And therefore as I
 highly commend these Lawes <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54116:18"/> we have already, and praise God
 for them, so I humbly pray a quickning of their execution, wherein our
 Worthies, had they not so heavy pressures upon their shoulders, as are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
 to break their backs, (I am sure they have broke the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits already of
 divers, whose loss we have cause to lament with watery eyes) they might humbly
 be implored for some Inlivening, Quickning, Lawes, with such strict penalties
 an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the execution of them, as the Discoverer or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector might not
 onely be rewarded, but commended and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from disgrace and calumny.</p>
                  <p>The second generall cause of Barrenness is in the Earth
 itself,<note place="margin">A generall cause of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness.</note> and the
 principall causes of her Barrenness are very many, some are obvious to the
 Judgement, and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all,<note place="margin">Tilling.</note> as
 tilling Land till it bear no corn.</p>
                  <p>And mowing Ground till it Graze no more, or yeeld no grass;
 all which are easily to be remedied if men would learn moderation.</p>
                  <p>But my design lyes not so much in Reproving, as Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
 and discovering that there are many causes which lie more obscure, and are
 either not discerned at all, or else not adjudged any cause of Barrenness, or
 hinderance of the Earth her fertility, and so not at all endeavoured to be
 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and they are in some Lands; extreme Coldness of nature; having a
 moist springing water lying near, or just un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the surface or superficies of
 the Earth, which doth either eat away or devour the Sap, Fruit, and Strength of
 the said Lands, or else breed and increase the Rush, and Flagg, which groweth
 in the room of Grass, and eateth away the same.</p>
                  <p>Another cause is Rockiness, Stoniness, and Gravelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">Rockiness.</note> all which many times lie so near the surface of
 the Land, that they devour much of the Earth, and so make that little left so
 weak, that it can scarce bring forth any fruit.</p>
                  <p>Another cause is lying Mountainous,<note place="margin">Mountainous.</note> sometimes so near the Sea, that the Vapors and
 Fogs, that come from thence, anoy the same. Also lying far from the Sun and in
 shady parts occasioneth Barrenness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54116:19"/>Another cause of Barrenness is the
 unsuitable, unnaturall laying down of Land to Graze,<note place="margin">Improvidence laying down all Lands.</note> a cause scarce imagined
 so to be; or the present ill lying of Land, that hath layen long, and was
 ancient Inclosure, al which are infinitely more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the fertility
 thereof than can be imagined, till contrary experience hath discovered it:
 (<hi>viz</hi>) For that Land that is sandy,<note place="margin">How to lay down
warm Land.</note> warm, or gravelly, that to be laid on high Ridge or Furrow is
 directly contrary to the naturall fruitfulness of that Land; And that which is
 of a cold, moist, spewing or weeping nature, for that to be laid down flat or
 levell,<note place="margin">How cold Land.</note> is to the ruin and destruction
 of that also, and is an extreme on the other hand.</p>
                  <p>The latter sort requireth high ridged Lands, and clear open
 Furrowes; and the first sort the contrary: and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all lands whatsoever
 to be laid down in good heart and strength.</p>
                  <p>Also another cause is the standing of the winter water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
 the land,<note place="margin">Standing water in winter.</note> or the rain of
 Heaven; I say not the running over lands, so that it may be laid dry at
 pleasure, but the standing, soaking water breeds the Rush and fowleness, and
 likewise gnawes out the heart and strength of it, like the worm at the stomack,
 and devoureth the strength of it, as experience will shew in mady parts of the
 Land, where great Balkes betwixt Lands, Hades, Meares, or Divisions betwixt
 Land and Land are left, and one Furlong butting, or Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landing, upon other
 Furlogns, makes such a stoppage of the free passage of the water, that a great
 part of that land lyeth as it were drowned a great part of the year, that it
 over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not that backing many times till near Midsummer, when other sound
 Lands have yeelded a full half yeares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and so for half a year yeelds
 little or no profit at all.</p>
                  <p>Another great prejudice is the Mole-hills,<note place="margin">Mole hils.</note> and the Ant-hills, although I shall not directly
 argue hence Barrenness naturally, yet accidentally they much barrennize it,
 therefore I shall demonstrate the evil of both; for the Mole-hills that
 destroyes some part of the Land, by the severall casting up of much mould upon
 the Grass, all which are hinderanees very great to the increase of the owner.
 But for the Ant-hils, <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54116:19"/> if my opinion fail not excedingly,
 they are grand ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Grazier, and Husbandmans advantage, they
 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy more than men observe, I do beleeve that in some great Pastures in
 <hi>England,</hi> there is one fourth part of the clear fruit of that Land lost
 by the multiplicity of them, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better in other pastures by the
 Molehills: for although some are of opinion that the Ant-hills are little or no
 pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, they are much mistaken, and they will clearly bee convinced
 thereof, if they will but either seriously consider the quantity of grass that
 groweth upon them, or else con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the rareness of Cattle feeding upon them,
 and then also consider the quantity of Ground, and good Ground, they cover,
 will easily appear the great prejudice by them. And that the sand and gravell
 washed from the Mole-hill, is a great cause of rotting Sheep I absolutely
 affirm.</p>
                  <p>But thereto some may object, they make more ground.</p>
                  <p>I Answer,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> they do, such as it is;
 destroy a lesser good quantity of Land,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> and add
 possibly a double bad: but let them consider that this Addition is a great
 Substraction; for if you weigh what I said before, they bear little, or no
 grass, a little wild Time, and speary harsh grass, that Cattell eat not but a
 little thereof in case of hunger; And I am sure they cover a great deal of good
 land. Doe but really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it upon experience made upon one Acre, and thou
 shalt find that one Acre plain or bancked shall do as much ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as an Acre
 and near an half shall do that is so hilly; And again, if you do not flatter
 your selves in your own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you will find that while the Land was
 plain, if you consider the fruit it then yeelded, and the Cattle it then
 maintained, you will find there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what it then kept,
 and what it now maintaines, for in my experience I find that old resty Land,
 much overrun with these hills, much degenerates, and doth not, nor hath of late
 yeares kept the former usuall Stock it kept before it grew so hilly, and so
 old, by near or about one fourth part, which I am sure is as much or more
 advantage, or clear profit, the Grazier, Breeder, or Tenant need expect; and
 although some will not acknowledge their experience here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54116:20"/> yet many I am sure they find it by losing proof, besides the danger
 of casting their Cattle and Sheep betwixt the Hills, which oft destroyes
 them.</p>
                  <p>Another cause of Barrenness is Bogginess or Mieriness,<note place="margin">Bogginess.</note> which turns all Lands, both bad, good, and
 better, into such a state of Barrenness &amp; unfruitfulness, that it in some
 parts almost destroyes the Land, and in other parts it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroyes it,
 and in some places makes it worse than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in stead of yeelding some fruit, it
 not onely yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth none, but corrupts and prejudiceth other Lands on which it
 borders, and it self most dangerous to mischieve the Goods or Chattell that do
 pasture upon the same, and so may be accidentally many degrees worse than
 nothing.</p>
                  <p>Another cause of Barrenness is the Overflowing,<note place="margin">Constant res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on that Land.</note> and constant
 abiding or resting of the waters of the Sea, Fenns, Rivers, standing Lakes or
 Pools, for be it fresh or salt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if it lye constantly upon it, it
 assuredly destroyeth it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although some more, some less, according to the
 deepness, and barrenness of the water which covers it, &amp; the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of
 the ground on which it lyeth, so is the fruitfulness more or less perspicuous.
 Some pretend strange causes which my plainess fathomes not, nor much affects
 our Country Farmers now.</p>
                  <p>Yet one more I must not pass by, &amp; that is such New
 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions for the Improving of Land discovered by some young Husband-man at
 experiences as I conceive the use wherof will rather destroy Land, and wast a
 mans profits therupon, than advance: &amp; some such I have lately found in a
 little book called <hi>New Inventions for the Improving lands, Printed for</hi>
 J. S. <hi>and sold at the sign of the Ball on Adling hill,</hi> 1646. By which
 I fearing some willing to lay out themselvs in Husbandry experience should be
 beguiled by his so great overtures of Advantage, I shall onely speak to two or
 three particulars, and leave the rest to thy leisure to consider of.</p>
                  <p>First, As to his manuring Plough, manuring Wagon, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring
 Stone, Corroding Harrow, or Corroding Rakes, which he pretends as Improvements,
 so far as my shallow Principles will compass, are likely to prove
 Impoverishers, <pb n="13" facs="tcp:54116:20"/> because while a man stands to dress his
 Land with fine mould, in which is a little strength, his Land decayes for want
 of good soyl or ranck muck, which he may sooner lay on, &amp; work into his
 Land by the old way, than he may his fine earth by his new devised mysticall
 Instruments, not one of them discovered neither; but puzzle thy self thou mayst
 about the thoughts thereof, and though thou givest twice as much for the book
 as it is worth, for so thou must, thou art but where thou wast at first: And
 for his Seed-Barr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w, could he but
 hold that forth to set Corn as he pretends, it might be of some good use,
 because certainly setting Corn, could it be done with speed, and at a certain
 depth, and well cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, would be worth discovering; but of this I have as
 little hope and as low an esteem as of his other aforesaid Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
 because he holds it out to contain one Tunnell onely for his Seed, which did it
 contain a hundred, would more likely prove; for in setting one seed at once, no
 Engine can come near the hand-setting as I conceive; And this I charge as a
 great prejudice, and may be as a barrenning the land, while men stand looking
 for great things, they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their ordinary and old way of Hushandry, far
 better.</p>
                  <p>Another cause of Barrenness which this Gentleman puts as a
 meanes of Improvement is the setting up or banking into a mans land the Rain
 water, or cold Spring water, and then trampling in dung by carting and cattell,
 as he saith, will raise and increase mire and dirt; and so it will, I must
 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, but what that mireand dirt is worth, I know not: the dung would be
 excellent good of it self, but what it will be in this course of husbandry, I
 not only much question, but affirm, that in all my experience, that treading,
 poching, and holing land in winter, was an exceeding great hinderance to Corn
 or Grass that Spring; nay some Land I have known so poched by Cattels treading,
 though fothered upon the same, both in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> and
 many other parts, that it hath not recovered of divers years: And what strength
 or vertue cold spring-water or rain-water hath to fatten any land, I know not,
 but wonder then how we have any barren land in <hi>England.</hi> And to make
 good his Assertion, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales <pb n="14" facs="tcp:54116:21"/> to them that float Land
 by Rivers, whose practice clean confutes his opinion, who study to drain their
 Land as fast as float it; and the best and most skilfull of them will drown
 none at all, unless for a day or two, but drain as fast, and draw off as fast
 as they bring it on: And to prove his Tenent, he affirms how advantageous it
 will be in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the flouds by his inbankments to secure the Fens from
 drowning, which is as likely as to keep the Sea from flowing after ebbing; for
 he that will make banks to keep in Land-flouds, may as well make a hedge to
 keep in the Cuckow; and whereas he pretends hereby to raise new Springs, that
 may be; sure I am he will raise new Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and what good use they are of,
 I am yet to learn. And for Barren Land which he seemes so well skilled in the
 Improvement, which he desires to purchase, I will help him to enough, if he
 will either be pleased to return a mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d answer if my plainess have offended him, or else practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
 make good what he hath affirmed; for that a man doth do, is far more credible
 than that he affirmes he can do. Many other causes of offences might be spoken
 unto, but they are referred to a more proper Opportunity, wherein they may
 receive a more suitable capacity of removall, and will be dropped into the
 discourse at large, as occasion most seasonably is administred. And so I
 proceed to the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the said Barrenness. But before I descend to the
 particulars, consider the severall sorts of Lands that will admit of
 Improvement, <hi>Which I consider under two Generall Heads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1 Head.</note> all inclosed, Severall
 Land, whether Meadow or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Head.</note> Common Lands,
 whether Arable or Grazing. First, Severall inclosed Lands I divide into three
 sorts, or else will rank them under three Heads.</p>
                  <p>1 First shall be our worst sort of Lands of what nature soever
 they be, from the value of one shilling <hi>per</hi> Acre, to Ten shillings;
 The Improvement whereof will fall under most of the six particular Pieces, it
 being capable of most and greatest <hi>Improvement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54116:21"/>2 Secondly, is our middle sorts of Lands,
 from the value of Ten shillings <hi>per</hi> Acre, unto Twenty, which falls
 natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the third Piece or way of Improvement, yet is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable oft
 times to fall under some or most of the other Pieces also.</p>
                  <p>3 Third shall be our richest Land, from Twenty shillings
 <hi>per</hi> Acre, to forty, and from forty to three or four Pounds an Acre;
 some of this sort will admit of very little or no Improvement, having all
 Naturall, and Artificiall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments already made upon it, but some others of
 this richer sort will admit of a very considerable Improvement, and is
 principally discovered under the sixt Piece. Neither can I say that all Lands
 without exception of the two former sorts may be Improved: For possibly, and
 out of question very much is Improved already, and others may lie so void of
 any capacity of Improvement, that either there may be none at all, or else none
 that will raise such Improvements, as will well and sufficiently requite the
 charge and cost bestowed; but comparatively not much of this in
 <hi>England.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Only improve upon great
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And my design is principally to hold onely forth poss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
 of Improving at a far inferiour charge to the cost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, and the
 Improvement made from such materialls, as generally are lost, or little or no
 whit practised in most parts of the Land.</p>
                  <p>The second Generall are our common Lands, whether errable,
 constantly unde Tillage, such as are our common fields, all the fieldon or
 field Land throughout the Nation, of which there may be three sorts also, Bad,
 Better, Best of all, and all and every part thereof may be very much and
 manifoldly advanced, under some or all of the aforesaid Pieces; or else whether
 it be Commons or Commune of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures upon those great and vast Commons, called
 Heaths, Forrests, Moores, Marshes, Meades, or whatsoever of them, Those also
 may admit of a very great Advancement, and these Lands will fall familiarly
 under every Piece, according to their severall values, and capacities, but most
 especially under the third and fourth Piece, treating of Tillage, and
 Inclosure. And then I shall proceed to shew you the nature <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54116:22"/>
 of each sorts of Lands whereby the Remedies will be most facile and easie in
 the application. And so I have ended the first Generall.</p>

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>The Cure followes now more largely.</head>
                     <p>ALl sorts of Lands, of what nature or quality soever they
be, under what Climate soever, of what constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or condition soever, of
what face or character soever they be (unless it be such as Naturally
participates of so much fatness, which Artificially it may be raised unto) wil
admit of a very large Improvement. Yet the fattest Land was, hath been, or may
be bettered by good husbandry.</p>
                     <p>And such are the Lands that lye near or bordering upon any
River,<note place="margin">Under great Rivers will be the best Land.</note> or
small Brooks, your little Rivers, and Rivulets, admitting of greater falls and
descents than your bigger Rivers do, which run more dull &amp; slow, more dead
and levell, whereby little Opportunity will be gained of bringing but little
Land to so great advance by them, but where the greater Rivers can be gained
over any Lands, there will the Improvement be the greatest, and the Lands made
the richest,<note place="margin">And under lesser the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantities and
  greatest Improvement.</note> the greater Rivers being usually the
fruit-fullest, having more Land-floods fall into them; But under your lesser
Brooks may your greatest quantities of Land be gained, and your water most
easily and with small charge be brought over greater parcels than upon greater
Rivers.</p>
                     <p>1 For the discovering of such Lands as lie under this
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, you must seriously consider the Situation of your Lands; If your
Lands be a little hilly, and your Brooks run more swiftly, more Lands may be
brought under them: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so if your Lands lye more shelving or descending towards
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54116:23"/> the River, or any low descent whatever, that your water
may fall off as fast as it cometh on, the quicker and easier will your Land be
Improved, especially if your Land be sound, light, or gravelly: This is a most
gallant opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let your Lands be what they will, or of what nature
soever, if it lie descending, the advance will be great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if you have
either a constant stream, or Landflood.</p>
                     <p>And here let me (good Reader) advertise thee of one Piece of
husbandry, most highly commended of most men; And truly so it is very
commendable, and excellent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd either with those that use none, or else
neglect this where it may be done, which is this,</p>
                     <p>Many Gentlemen have assaid to water their Lands, by setting
the Water in Pooles,<note place="margin">Setting water on Pooles or Lakes not so
  excellent.</note> Ponds, or Lakes upon them, and continuing it standing, and
soaking many daies and weeks together; yea some practise it although their
lands have layen descending; and then draw their Sluces, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their
stoppages, and drain away all their water again; to which way of flowing, I
incourage all men rather than neglect all, and honour them therein; yet if they
please to make experiment of the succeeding way of floating, they will easily
let this fall; The excellency whereof consists in the speedy taking away the
Water, as soon as it is brought on; And onely suffer it to run over, and so
with all speed run off into some drayning Trench again: The Method whereof
shall at large be handled, by which, such a concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Advantage will be
discovered, that men will wonder how they were so easily deceived. Wherein I
shall be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what larger, because able men much differ both in their opinions
of both waies of watering, as also in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working the same.</p>
                     <p>My advise shall he, never cover thy Land with a standing
Water,<note place="margin">In what Cases to cover land by Water.</note> unless
for a day or two, or else in case thy Land should be so Levell that it hath no
descent at all, then better set the Water upon it, than neglect it, so thou be
sure to drain it after one or two days standing, and then bring it on again,
&amp; take it off again, as aforesaid, yet it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ever to produce
the like effect, as it shall according to <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54116:23"/> the subsequent
directions; Because it neither receives the full fruit, or fatness of the water
so fully and kindly, nor is grazable and feedable so soon, nor yet so richly as
in the other kind of working.</p>
                     <p>2. After thou hast considered the Situation of thy Lands, as
aforesaid, then search, and find out the lowest part of thy Lands, and there
having found such a Levell or descent, as will lay all thy Lands dry again, as
thou shalt have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to float them, which drain must be wrought So deep,
as that thou maist go under that corrupt feeding, or sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy moisture, that
breeds and feeds the Rush, Flag, and Mareblab, or else causes thy Land to turn
Spewing, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, or boggy, which two Advantages, if thou hadst dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and found upon thy Land (which little Land in <hi>England,</hi> but hath one or
both of them) come to the third Direction, and,</p>
                     <p>3. Therein consider seriously the nature of thy Land,<note place="margin">Land sad and moist worst to Improve by watering.</note> which if
it be cold, and of a sad Nature, moyst and spew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lie very Levell, It
will require then a very good Land-flood, or a constant River to overflow it,
and other barren hungry Water will do very little good thereof.</p>
                     <p>But, if either thy Land be Gravell,<note place="margin">Land
  found, dry, and warm the best.</note> or of a sound, warm, sandy, or mixed
nature, and any whit descending, then any Running stream will have a gallant
Operation, The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, lighter, and sounder is the Land, the greater is the
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. These particulars discovered, out of question thou hast a
wonderfull advantage before thee, especially if thou hast any great length and
quantity of Land along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or by a great Road-way side, or else hast
any good Land-floods from great Towns or Cities, make as much of these
Advantages, and prize them as thy Lands, for though hereby thou canst make thy
Lands no more, yet thou mayst make them so much better, as thou canst
desire.</p>
                     <p>Suppose some man of great credit should say, Sir, you have
two hundred Acres in such a place, what if I should lay you a hundred more in
the midst of them? he would wonder at it; yet because of the credit of him that
spake it, he doth not wholly disdain it, and if it could be done, he 
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54116:24"/> deserved thanks for it; but he doth do it really, though
not in kind, that advanceth or Improves the Land but one third part, that makes
Two Acres as good as Three, much more he that makes One as good as Three, or
Five, or Ten, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this watering business be done shall clearly appear;
&amp; so I descend to the working out the same. I had forgot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother sort of
Land which is your Boggy Quagmiry Land,<note place="margin">Boggy Lands good for
  wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> no less capable of a mighty Improvement if it fall under the
opportunity of floating, and ly any whit descending.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Herein a little consider of the way of both fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy
 Land to thy Water, &amp; thy Water to thy Land, with the truest, naturallest,
 &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest Seasons for bringing it on, and taking it off, and thou shalt
 see an admired issue.</p>
                  <p>And being resolved that thou hast an opportunity upon thy
 Lands to make this Improvement out, Plot out thy Land into such a Modell or
 Platform as thou maist be sure that all thy Land thou designest to this
 Improvement, may not fail therin, I mean that all thy Lands thou resolvest to
 float may be under the true Levell of thy Water; And that this may be, I shall
 here discover to thee how to carry thy Water upon the Levell, that thou shalt
 lose no ground, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carry it so dead, that thou canst not kindly work it,
 &amp; this precisely observed, may be in stead of many Persian Wheels so highly
 commended by Mr <hi>Gabriel Plats,</hi> which Wheel is also commendable, &amp;
 may be very usefull, where either no good falls can be gained, nor other wales
 the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot be raised to higher parts of ground you desire to water; The
 description of which Persian Wheel I hope to give thee before this discourse be
 ended, And also intend <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54116:24"/> in my Additions; if not where I
 describe &amp; figure out the Persian Wheel, to discover a far better Engine,
 that shal with less strength raise a greater quantity of water for any use.</p>
                  <p>And now for the Method or way of working thy Water upon thy
 Land without this Wheel, which will require a double stream, one to drive it,
 and another to be raised, &amp; without the charge of all other appurtenances
 to the said Wheel belonging, as Dams, Sluces, &amp;c. and the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of
 the same for preservation of this charge, and for the moee easy working the
 Improvement.</p>
                  <p>Take a most exact Survey of thy Water, not by thy Eye onely,
 but by, and with a true exact Water Levell, which is an instrument though plain
 and easy, yet rarely made nor used among us, which shall be largely described
 among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tools in the tenth Chapter;<note place="margin">How to begin the
first piece of watering.</note> then either begin at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver end, or neather
 end of thy Land, which thou pleasest, if at the over end, where the water first
 entreth into thy Land. And by thy Levell discover and plot out where thy water
 will go along thy Land, as thou goest downeward, that so thou maiest lose no
 Land, that will easily be brought under thy water; Then cut out thy Master
 Trench or Water-course if thou pleasest to such a bigness as may contain all
 thy Land-floud, especially to bring it within thy Land, and so bring down thy
 whole Water-course together: But the most certainest way is, as soon as thou
 hast brought thy Water within thy Land, upon the superficies of it, then carry
 it along in a foot broad Trench or lesser all along thy Levell, which Water
 will be a great help, and a second and truer Levell than the other, and in thy
 working of it thou shalt find all little enough too prevent too dead a Levell,
 &amp; yet lose no Ground neither: If thy Levell be too dead, the lesser stream
 will follow thee, so that a convenient descent must be minded also to give the
 water a fair and plausible passage or current all along. And if thou discover
 in his lesser Trench, any mistake or failing, then thou mayest with more ease
 and less charge amend the same easily by going higher upon thy Land, or lower
 towards the water, &amp; stop up the same again (for thy Trench need be no
 deeper than <pb n="22" facs="tcp:54116:25"/> the thickness of thy over Turff) and cut out a
 new, and so thou mayst most certainly demonstrate where thy main work shall go
 without hazard, which will be a great. certainty, and little loss.</p>
                  <p>This done, thou mayest cut out thy water-course, and be sure
 it be large enough to contain the whole Water thou needest or intendest, and so
 thou have longitude or length of ground, the Trench must be the broader, not
 the deeper, for a shallow Trench is best for this work. And when thou hast
 brought it so far into thy land, as thou hast any land to work upon, thou mayst
 a little narrow thy Course as thou seest the quantity of thy land, or water
 requires, &amp; so far as thou wouldest have thy course float over all at once,
 thou must cut thy trench narrower &amp; narrower, all along to the neather end,
 that so without stops and staies it may flow all along at once, the Trench
 being narrower and narrower, that Water that comes within the Trench when it is
 wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der must needs be thrust out when the narrower cannot contain it; for here
 is the true excellency of this sort of Trenches; and thus should all thy
 floating Trenches bee made in every work.</p>
                  <p>As soon as thou hast brought thy water upon thy Land, and
 turned it over, or upon it, then as aforesaid, be sure thou take it off as
 speedy as possibly, and so fail not to cut out thy work, so as unless thy Land
 bee very sound, and thy Land-floud very Rich, thou must take it off the sooner
 by a deep drayning Trench, therefore I prescribe thee no certain breadth
 betwixt floating and drayning Trenches, but if thy Land is sounder and Dryer,
 or lieth more Descending,<note place="margin">How to make the drayning
Trench.</note> thou mayest let it run the broader, and as the Land is Moyst,
 Sad, Rushey and Levell, let it run the lesser breadth or compass; And for thy
 drayning Trench it must bee made so deep that it goe to the bottom of the cold
 spewing moyst water, that feeds the Flagg and Rush; for the wideness of it, use
 thine own liberty, but bee sure to make it so wide as thou mayest goe to the
 bottom of it, which must bee so low as any moysture lyeth, which moysture
 usually lyeth under the over <pb n="23" facs="tcp:54116:25"/> and second swarth of the
 Earth, in some Gravell or Sand, or else, where some greater Stones are mixt
 with clay, under which thou must go half one Spades graft deep at lest: Yea
 suppose this corruption that feeds and nourisheth the Rush or Flagg should lie
 a yard or four foot deep, to the bottom of it thou must go, if ever thou wilt
 drain it to purpose, or make the utmost advantage of either float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or
 draining, without which thy water cannot have its kindly Operation: for though
 the water fatten naturally, yet still this Coldness and Moisture lies gnawing
 within, and not being taken clean away, it eats out what the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fattens.
 And this also I must desire thee seriously to observe, that as soon as thy
 Water hath spent it self, and the Earth or Grass hath exhausted and drawn out
 of the Water her strength and richness, then how long soever it runs longer and
 further, it prejudiceth and corrupts it by breeding the Rushes in abundance:
 The water running trickling among the Grass, and upon the Earth,<note place="margin">Shewes how the water is fruitfull.</note> leaving her Thickness,
 Soyl or Filth, which I call Richness, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Grass, and upon the Earth, and
 it self runneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into the drayning Trench, and troubles thee no more, and
 so the Goodness of the Water is as it were Ridled, Screened, and Strained out
 into the Land, and the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness slideth away from thee, which can never be
 done, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so speedily, nor so purely, by standing on Lakes or Pooles,
 besides the loss of the Grazing, which may be near as good in Winter as in
 Summer, upon a good Land-flood or rich Waters.</p>

 <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54116:27"/> a little Brook with a Land-flood, issuing out of a Common
 Field, was brought over it, the Land levelled, and made fit and even to receive
 it, for it was very Irregular, and of great high Ridges and Furrowes before
 (after the manner of that Country) and after two yeares working, thirty
 shillings an Acre would have been given for it, (I my self offered it, and some
 of that Land also was my own, but it was refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) being wrought just by the
 aforesaid Directions. I have made the like Improvement my self upon Lands of
 the same nature, to as great advancement as is here spoken off, too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to
 discourse. M. <hi>Plat</hi> also in his book, produceth a president of
 Lands,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Plats</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident.</note> Improved by
 Water, with the charge of three hundred shillings, to be worth three hundred

                  <p>As for Boggy Land also,<note place="margin">President of Boggy

 danger; And indeed it bore nothing but Cattayle's; And by this course I
 recovered it to perfect soundness, and made it worth betwixt thirty and forty
 shillings <hi>per</hi> Acre, and so dare undertake the like where ever, lying
 under the aforesaid Capacities. Many more presidents of this nature are visible
 in many parts of this Nation, Some as great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements as these, Some lesse,
 and yet very great; And all done without any other Cost or Expence of charge,
 in any other materialls than Poor mens labours: Which to me is a second
 argument of Incouragement, to promote all works of this nature under these
 Capacities. One thing more I pray thee observe, that though it be the common
 practice of most men in drayning their Land to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shallow Trenches of
 about one foot deep, aud lay their Mould on heapes, that so they may spoil put
 little ground, both which I must necessarily reprove as ill Husbandry: For
 though I am all for Floating,<note place="margin">To much Trenching is
madness</note> and Drayning, which will necessarily occasion many Trenches, yet
 I am an Enemy to <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54116:27"/> this ordinary and usuall way of
 Trenching; first for so many Trenches, I conceive no need in these works, nor
 upon any Land whatsoever, but something more of them, more sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably in the

 square, and as broad as can be taken up, which I exceedingly prize for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
 uses, and preserve. The one called a Flowing of Floating Trench, wherin I carry
 my water: which usually after I have brought my water where I intend to work
 it, I carry it in a Trench seldome above one foot deep,<note place="margin">Manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Trench.</note> or a foot and half,
 &amp; many times not above eight, or nine inches deep: that so it being made
 Artificially, (<hi>viz,</hi>) so Level &amp; taper, &amp; Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and
 Narrower, as aforesaid, the further it goes, that it may so cast out the water,
 that it may flow over the same for a furlongs length al at once, which is the
 Excellency of it; And then another drayning Trench running parallel with this,
 or Two if the Land lye very flat, and of such a depth as it may not onely
 receive all the water that Floweth over the Land clearly, but that it may also
 drain away the cold Moysture and Bogginess that offends the Land, by breeding
 either Rush or Bogg, and of such a latitude, or breadth, from my floating
 Trench, as thy water is of strength to Improve, without Prejudicing of it, by
 breeding Rush, Flag or filth, as aforesaid; And as I make not many Trenches, so
 I shall fil up all others that are not serviceable to these, and so have 
 <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54116:28"/> done many a one, that others have made to Drain their Land
 withall, and with this One or Two Draines cast out, in the lowest part of my
 Land, layed dry more Land than a hundred of these common Trenches would, for a
 thousand Trenches made above the Corruption that feeds the Boggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">A shallow Trench doth certain hurt and uncertain good.</note> or
 Rushes, never Draynes, or takes away the cause, that the effect cannot possibly
 cease. As for heaping the Earth, and moyling the ground, that I also conceive
 may be prevented by maintaining one Horse and Cart, and sometimes a couple of
 Wheel-Barrowes,<note place="margin">How to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heaping Earth, and in evening
the ground.</note> or a double Wheel-Barrow with two Wheeles, made big enough
 for two men to wield, or a little Cart made with two little Wheeles, and
 another lesser than them by half, to bear it at a constant pitch to fill, which
 may be so made, that either with two men or a horse you may carry away a great
 weight with much speed, and shift it horse and man at pleasure, which shall be
 described at large in the shaddow of it in the Tenth Chapter of Trenching
 tooles, and into them I cast my Mould, as I digg or cut out my Trench, and so
 carry it away when I first digg it, either into some old Trench or hollow
 place, and there lay it, and then take my Turf, which I took up in all my other
 Trenches, and cover over that Earth, and there will be as good Soard that year,
 if it be laid before <hi>February</hi> enter, as in many parts of the Field
 beside; And so shall save both the labour of removing my heaps afterward, and
 the spoyling of so much Land as they would cover. And for the better carrying
 on this Improvement by Water, if thy Lands be either Hilly or Banky, or lye
 high Ridge or Furrowes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which thy water will never work kindly, take a
 Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on or two for the more easie Levelling of the same (how to levell or

 <pb n="29" facs="tcp:54116:28"/> of <hi>September</hi> first to plough thy land, which I
 advise to cast as most men do a Fallow, and then in the beginning of
 <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> be sure to give it a second plowing, just overthwart all
 the Lands, and so cut the Turf, that the Soard may have all the Winters frost
 to wrox, and moulder it, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>March</hi> thou mayst plow again,
 and so cast it or raise it,<note place="margin">Plowing to Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,</note> as thy
 Land requireth, to bring it most even, and levell, and if one more plowing will
 not do it, then thou must do more, and Harrow it also, to draw down high

 so high that the Plough and Harrow will not bring them down, thou must get some
 Labourers, with their Spades,<note place="margin">Spade to help Levelling.</note>
 and take down those places, and cast them into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. A Labourer with a
 Spade upon this wrought Land will do aboundance in a day; but be most Exact and
 curious in Levelling thy Land, it brings more Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages than thou art aware
 of, or I have time to shew: And then about the middest of <hi>April,</hi> sow
 thy Lands with such seeds as are more suitable to the nature, and richness of
 it, but sow it not too thick by any meant, nor too thin neither, but the
 thinner is thy Corn, the stronger it will be, and the more grass will grow
 among, which will help thee more in the Soarding of it, than hinder thee in the
 Crop of it, which Crop may pay a considerable summe towards this Charges; But
 it thou desire a more speedy Soarding of it, and hast no respect to the present
 profit nor charge,<note place="margin">The speediest Soarding of Land.</note> in
 respect of a suddain dispatch of it, then as before, so soon as Grass begins to
 stand at a stay, and growes but a little, plow thy Land a thin broad furrow,
 exceeding exact, and true, or rather flay it, or take off thy Skin or Turf with
 a very broad whinged or rushed share, as broad a Furrow as thy Plough will
 carry; and as soon as thou hast plowed it, cut it all at such length, as thy
 Turf may hold taking up, and heap thy Turf speedily upon the next Land, and
 then plow thy Land again and cast it down, and if it lye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high; cast
 it twice, and then two men with their Spades will levell any uneven Hill or
 Ridge most easily, and thou mayst either with the Plough or Spade, or both, 
 <pb n="30" facs="tcp:54116:29"/> immediately bring it flat, and pursue the work with all
 vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, the Turf being taken up, speed thy levelling with Plough and Spade,
 that so thou maiest be suddenly ready to lay down thy Turf again, and then take
 this Turf, by all meanes before the Grass be killed, or lose the colour, or
 deaded, and lay it down as thou plowedst it up, every Joynt meeting and closing
 as even as thou canst possibly, and expect how much soever thou canst make
 plain, and Levell before <hi>February,</hi> thou mayest reap great fruit, or a
 good Crop of Grass that Summer, especially if thou hast Water to float it
 withall, and when thou hast done One Land, then thou maiest remove thy
 Furrowes, or Turf, to that thou hast levelled, and work that Land accordingly
 as the other, and then Turf it also, and so goe forward throughout thy Field
 one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Some others have levelled all by the Spade,<note place="margin">Levelling Land by the Spade.</note> and by that means they have,
 or may more certainly mix their hungry Land, and fat Land more equally, and lay
 it down all alike hereby, which course also I very well approve, and if a man
 have very good Tooles, and Irons made on purpose, one to cut out his Turf, and
 another to take it up square, and even, as big as it will possibly hold to take
 up, or a man can easily raise with his naturall strength, which Tooles are
 hereafter to be discoursed in the Tenth Chapter, he may very near dispatch as
 much, as otherwise is directed, if the Land be very uneven. I have had a man
 hath taken up Turf all day long near two foot square, if not above, and heaped
 the same,<note place="margin">A president what one man hath done at Turffing and
Levelling Land.</note> and three other men have followed, and levelled, and he
 hath also laid and planted down the same as fast as they could levell it: You
 cannot possibly beleeve how fast work will goe forward, with true Artificiall
 Tooles made exact to every purpose, and how much delight men will have to work
 with them. And if thou wilt be curiously Exact indeed, thou maiest after a
 Shower, or after thy Land is once soaked, or throughly wet thorough, get two or
 three broad Beaters made of a Plank betwixt two or three Inches thick, fourteen
 or fifteen Inches <pb n="31" facs="tcp:54116:29"/> long, and about nine Inches broad, with
 a good strong Stail put into, or near the middest of it, with which beat over
 all thy Land; one lusty Labourer will goe over a great deal of Land, and it
 will lay it curiously and even, and very delightfull to the eye, aud suitable
 to the Water working.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Herein is to be handled Drayning, or taking away Superfluous
 and Venomous Water, which lyeth in the Earth, and much occasioneth Bogginess,
 Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Rushes, Flags, and other filth, and is indeed the chief cause of
 Barrenness in any Land of this nature. Something I have already spoken as to
 Bogginess, that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under a Capacity to be floated with Water, either Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
 or Land-floods; in the Reducement whereof, you must precisely apply your self
 to al Parts of the former Chapter, for bringing your Water upon your Land, and
 working it also, and taking it off again; Especially that your Dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Trench
 or Trenches (for possibly in this sort of Land more may be required, according
 to the nature of the lying of your Land, if Uneven, and full of Dales, and
 Vallies) be made one Spades graft or pitch below the matter of the Bog, I mean
 the Spring, for so it is; which must be clearly Drayned, which I cannot too oft
 remind you of; But now I onely speak to those Lands which are from under such a
 Capacity of floating with Water; And are onely such as are covered with
 constant Water, and Lakes, or else the Boggy, Miry Lands, it self, and have no
 River, or Land-flood to be brought over them, and the remedies being equally 
 <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54116:30"/> applicatory to both for the most part, I will propose
 gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall remedies. I say that Drayning is an excellent and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est meanes
 for their Reducement; and for the depth of such Draynes I cannot possibly
 bound, because I have not time, and opportunity, to take in all circumstances,
 therefore in generall thus.</p>
                  <p>Be sure thy Draines be such,<note place="margin">How to make thy
Drayn to drain a Bog to purpose.</note> and so deep, and so deep, as thou hast
 a descent in the end thereof to take away all thy water from thy Drayn to the
 very bottom, or else it is to no use at all; for suppose thou make thy Drain as
 high as an house, and canst not take thy water from it, thy work is lost; for
 look how low soever is thy lowest levell in thy Drain, thou mayst drain thy
 water so low, and not one haires breadth lower will it drain thy ground than
 theu hast a fall or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to take it cleanly from thy Drain; therefore be
 especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally carefull herein, and then if thou canst get a low descent from
 thence, carry thy Drain upon thy Levell untill thou art assuredly got under
 that moysture, mirinesse, or water, that either offends thy Bog, or covers thy
 Land; and goe one Spades graft deeper by all meanes, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, and then
 thou needest not tye thy self precisely to a dead Levell, but as thy ground
 riseth, or as the moysture ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth higher, so mayst thou rise also, so that thou
 keep one Spades graft as aforesaid under it;<note place="margin">Where water
lyeth in Rushy Land.</note> and that thou mayst not fall herein, observe that
 in Cold Rushy Land this moysture or cold hungry water is found beneath the
 first and second swarth of thy Land; and then oft-times thou commest
 imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately unto a little Gravill, or Stoniness, in which this water is, and
 sometimes below this in a hungry gravell, and many times this Gravell or
 Stoniness lyeth lower as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid; but in Boggy Land it usually lyeth deeper
 than in Rushy, but to the bottom where the spewing Spring lyeth thou must goe,
 and one spades depth or graft beneath, how deep soever it be, if thou wilt
 drain thy Land to purpose. I am forced to use Repetions of some things,
 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the suitableness of the things, to which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; as also
 because of the slowness of peoples Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of them, as appeares by the
 non-practise of them, the <pb n="34" facs="tcp:54116:31"/> which were ever you see drayning
 and trenching you shal rarely find few or none of them wrought to the
 bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
                  <p>And for the matter or Bogg-maker that is most easily
 discovered,<note place="margin">The matter that feeds the Bog, where that
lyeth.</note> for sometimes it lyeth within two foot of the top of the ground,
 and sometimes and very usually within three or four foot, yet also some lye far
 deeper, six, eight, or nine foot, and all these are feazable to be wrought, and
 the Bog to be discovered, but not untill thou come past the black Earth, or
 Turf, which usually is two or three foot thick, unto another sort of Earth, and
 sometimes to old Wood; and Trees, I mean the proportion and form there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but
 the nature is turned as soft, and tender as the earth it self, which have layen
 there no man knowes how long, and then to a white Earth many times,<note place="margin">Every Bog hath most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a living Spring within it.</note>
 like Lime as the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and white-Tawer, takes out their Lime-pits, and then
 to a Gravell, or Sand, where the water lyeth, and then one Spades depth clearly
 under this which is indeed nothing else but a spring that would fain burst
 forth at some certain place, which if it did clearly break out, and run quick
 and lively as other Springs do, thy Bog would dy, but being held down by the
 power and weight of the Earth, that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the Spring which boyles and
 workes up into the Earth, and as it were blowes it up, and filleth the Earth
 with Wind, as I may call it, and makes it swell and rise like a Puf-ball, as
 seldom or never you shall find any Bogg, but it lyeth higher and rising from
 the adjacent Land to it, so that I beleeve could you possibly light of the very
 place where the Spring naturally lyeth, you need but open that very place to
 your Quick-spring, and give it a clear vent, and certainly your Bog would
 decay, by reason whereof it hath so corrupted and swoln the Earth, as a Dropsie
 doth the Body, for if you observe the Mould, it is very light, and hollow, and
 three foot square thereof is not above the weight of one sollid foot of
 naturall Earth, Clay, or Land, whereby I conceive that how much soever this
 Mould is forced from the naturall weight, or hardness of solid Earth, or Clay,
 so much it is corrupted, swoln, or increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <pb n="35" facs="tcp:54116:31"/> and blown
 up, and so much it must be taken down, or let forth, before ever it be reduced;
 I therefore prescribe this direction, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Go to the bottom of the Bog,<note place="margin">Shewing how
every Drayn must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the lowest levell.</note> and there make a Trench in the sound ground, or else
 in some old Ditch, so low as thou verily conceivest thy self assuredly under
 the Levell of the Spring or spewing water, and then carry up thy Trench into
 thy Bog straight through the middle of it, one foot under that Spring or
 spewing water upon thy Levell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it rise higher, as many times the water
 or Spring riseth as the Land riseth, and sometimes lyeth very levell unto the
 very head of thy Bog, unto which thou must carry thy Drain, or within two or
 three yards of the very head of it, and then strike another Trench overthwart
 the very head both wayes, from that middle Trench, as far as thy Bog go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
 all along to the very end of it, still continuing one foot at least under the
 same, and possibly this may work a strange change in the ground, of it self,
 without any more Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,</p>
                  <p>But for these common and many Trenches,<note place="margin">Shallow Trench repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</note> oft times crooked too, that
 men usually make in their Boggy grounds, some one foot, some Two, never having
 respect to the cause or matter that maketh the Bog, to take that way, I say
 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with them as a great piece of Folly, lost labour and spoyl; which I
 desire as well to preserve the Reader from, as to put him upon any profitable
 Experiment: for truly they do far more hurt than good, destroy with their
 Trench and Earth cast out, half their Land, danger their Cattell, and when the
 Trench is old it stoppeth more than it taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, &amp; when it is new, as
 to the destroying the Bog it doth just nothing, onely take away a little water,
 which falles from the heavens, and weakens the Bog nothing at all, and to the
 end it pretends is of no use, for the cause thereof lyeth beneath and under the
 bottom of all their workes, and so remaines as fruitfull to the Bog as before,
 and more secure from reducement than if nothing was done at all upon it.<note place="margin">The most sure way to destroy a Bog.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or thus thou mayst work it some what a more certain 
 <pb n="93" facs="tcp:54116:32"/> way but more chargable, (<hi>viz.</hi>) After thou hast
 brought a Trench to the bottom of the Bog, then cut a good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall Trench
 about thy Bog, I mean according to the form of thy Bog, whether round, square,
 or long, or three or four yards within thy Boggy ground, for so far I do
 ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleeve it will Drayn that which thou leavest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy Trench at
 the depth aforesaid, that is underneath the spring water round; And when thou
 hast so done, make one work or two just overthwart it, upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
 all under the matter of the Bog, as is aforesaid, and in one yeares patience
 through Gods blessing, expect thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Issue; and if it be in such a place
 as will occasion great danger to thy Cattell, then having wrought thy Works,

 occasion stoppages of the water, and filling up of Trenches, and loss of

 Faggots, Willow, Alder, Elm, or Thorn, and lay in the bottom of thy works, and
 then take thy Turf thou tookest up in the top of thy Trench,<note place="margin">How to make Draynes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to any sheep or b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 green Soard downwards, and then fill up thy works levell again, untill thou
 come to the bottom or neather end of thy work, where thy Trench is so shallow,
 that it will not indanger thy Cattell; or rather take great Pibble stones or
 Flint stones, and so fill up the bottom of thy Trench about fifteen Inches

 Lands, thou mayst apply them <pb n="37" facs="tcp:54116:32"/> and save me much labour,
 being the main meanes of Fen Drayning. As for Sluces, Flood-gates, Waires, and
 Dams, are but secundary meanes, and being the proper work of an Engineer or
 good Carpenter, I shall say no more for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sake: But if thou canst by any
 meanes make thy self ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bringing any constant Stream or powerfull
 Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flood and Water, and constantly Flow over the same, as in the former
 Chapter, that will reduce it to a greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,<note place="margin">Floring

 Bog of all, as I have before declared by Experience.</p>
                  <p>As I conceive, the Bogs in many parts of the Nation were
 occasioned thus: wherever is a Bog,<note place="margin">The probable occasion or
first cause of Bogginess.</note> I am confident was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a Spring, which
 Spring running and venting it self, kept the Land round about it sound and dry,
 as where most clear Springs are at this day; but the said Spring stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up,
 either with leaves, or Cattels treading, or wood falling upon the same, or
 other filth (for I beleeve many, or most parts of this Land was very woody in
 former Ages) the Spring was stopped that it could not clearly vent, and so
 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Living water, would not be suppressed, or buried, but swels and boyles
 up into Bogginess, and so vents it self by little and little in a greater
 Compass of Land, because it cannot break forth clear together in a lesser,
 because of the pressure and weight of the Earth upon it, and this is the most
 naturall cause thereof that I can gather; And my Reason is this, In many Bogs
 (I will not say in all) I have found great Pieces, or Boughes, or Bodies of
 Trees lying in the bottom of the Bog, Four or Five foot deep, in the full
 proportion of a Tree or Bough, as it fell in, but when you come to take it up,
 you may cut it with your Spade just as as you do your Earth, and it goes to
 Earth, but how this should come so low, and lye so deep, and so familiarly in
 Lands of this nature, and not as frequently upon sound Lands, I cannot conceive
 otherwise than as aforesaid.</p>

 Engine Work, a good Engineer is a gallant and most usefull Instrument in a

 usefulness of them, little lesse necessary than our very wel-being; but those

 nothing but Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Experiments, that I fear the plainess of them will be no

                  <p>3. I answer thirdly, that many have made some Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

 given; And so may as well spoil all, as he that takes all or most of the
 Ingredients in a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and applies it to the Disease prescribed, but
 either he misseth in the Composition, or else in the Application; or else if he
 be right in all, he may fail for want of patience to wait the issue, but casts
 all away as worth nothing, and claps in with another Receit, and so is able to
 give no positive reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution what the effect thereof might be. Therefore I say

 the Nation, and left to Idle Practitioners, and Slothfull impatient Slubberers,
 who have not onely done it by the halfes, but stifled many a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant plotted
 Opportunity of a far greater Advance than it hath produced; And so possibly in
 many parts of the Nation there may be great Reparations of these Ruins, and a
 certain Reducement to high Advantage; As also some Addition possibly to their

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</note> is a way
 appliable to every other sort of Land whatever, which lye under that
 Opportunity, or Capacity, which is cutting straight the water-courses of little
 Brooks and Streames that run many times in spirall lines, and sometimes
 circularly, as they would make the figure 8. and so lose as much more excellent
 Land as need be, nay in some places twice or thrice as much; besides these
 Angles, Triangles, and almost Squares, and Circles, much endangering Cattell,
 by goaring, rushing, and thrusting them in, and also makes such stoppages, and
 oppositions to the water, that hinders the Current of it, and occasioneth it to
 lye soaking on the Land, that it either breedeth Rush, Flag, or Mareblab; Also
 the aforesaid directions is a great means of laying sound much Land overcome by
 Bogginess, the water lying so upon it, that it drowneth or stifleth a great
 part of the fruitfulness of it, yea, suffocateth and choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth others also
 bordering upon it, no small prejudice to <pb n="43" facs="tcp:54116:35"/> the Nation in
 generall, and to many Town-ships and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in particular. A straight
 water-course cut a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble depth, in a thousand parts of this Nation,
 would be more advantagious than we are aware of, or I will task my self here to

 many more much amended, that are almost destroyed; but a Law is wanting herein
 for present, which I hope will be supplied if it may appear Advancement to the
 Publick; for to Private Interests it is not possible to be the least prejudice,
 when every man hath benefit, and each man may also have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall allowance,

 are such as are kept up,<note place="margin">Some Mils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy more than they

 lye under their Mill-head; such Mills as are of little worth, or are by
 constant great charges maintained, I advise to be pulled down; the advance of
 the Land, when the water is let run his course, and not impounded, will be of
 far greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue many times: But in case the Mills should be so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
 and profitable too, and far more than the Lands they spoil, I shall then
 advise, that under thy Mill-dam, so many yards wide from it as may prevent
 breaking through,<note place="margin">To prevent corrupting land by a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam as
much as may be.</note> thou make a very deep Trench all along so far as thy
 lands are putrified, and thereinto receive all the issuing spew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water, and
 thereby stop or cut off the feeding of it upon thy meadow, and carry it away
 into thy back-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <pb n="44" facs="tcp:54116:36"/> or false course, by as deep a Trench,
 cut through the most low and convenient part of thy Meads: But put case thou
 shouldst have no convenient fall on that side thy Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, then thou must make
 some course, or plant some trough under thy Mill-dam, and so carry it under
 into some lower course that may preserve it from soaking thy meadows, or
 pastures under it, and by this meanes thou maiest in a good measure reduce thy
 Land to good soundness, and probably wholly cure it, and preserve thy Mill
 also. As for that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of hindering the grinding of corn, it is very
 frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, for</p>
                  <p>First, there are in many parts so many Mills, as hinder one
 another, and are scarce able to live one by another.</p>
                  <p>2. There are, or may be Wind-mills erected in most parts, that
 may supply that want, and are less chargable than Water-mills: And for that
 some say the wind is uncertain, I say it is so certain, that I am confident few
 or none need want grinding if they can get corn; for I my self live in a
 Country where are no other but Wind-mills, and have scarce in a twelvemonth
 known any want of grinding. But should it be so, one may be supplied by
 Horse-mills; one good horse will grind wheat easily, and two good horses will
 grind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good dry corn, and are not at that charge for repairs, as both
 Wind-mills and Water-mills are.</p>
                  <p>3. I say it is possible to devise a Mill, with truth of
 work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, and some other advantages, that two men may grind any good corn
 whatsoever, and that as much in an hour as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny usuall Water-mill in the
 Country; and to this work I shall commend one Mr. <hi>Dimock,</hi> a very
 ingenious Gentleman, and one who hath discovered so much to the World already,
 as may give sufficient testimony of the truth of his abilities in this

and easily would; Nor the taking off the downfalls, as our Fen men call them,

is it the taking off all Land-falls, Land-floods, or great waters from off
those Lands; No nor the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all these in a customary and usuall way that
doth or will deserve to be called a perfect Drayning.</p>
                     <p>But it is as I formerly said about recovering Boggy-Lands, a

                     <p>And the taking away this is perfect Drayning; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I say the other Draynings are not the best nor perfect, yet I neither
discommend the other, nor discourage from them where they are made already, or

we have brought it to it's best perfection, that is, not onely to recover it
from drowning to bearing sedge or reedy flaggy grass, which is the first fruits
of Draining, and from which the rude ignorant Fen-man desires no appeal, nor is
it to recover it to bear morish foul strong grass in Summer, and Drowned in
Winter, nor yet to lye dry both Winter and Summer upon the Surface of the
Earth, and wet and Boggy at the spades or Plough-share point,<note place="margin">How to know when Land is firmly Drayned.</note> nay though it will
through a dry season or heat of Summer bear the Plough, and much of it may be

at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting the Improvement of them, that are very able there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, &amp; I am
confident would have recovered them, yet part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because of their ignorance of
the lying of them, conceiving them to be some great Lake, Pan, or Meer, as are
some in <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, Cheshire,</hi> or <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> that lyeth so
low that hath no fall or out-let can be made to drain out the Waters of them,
and partly through the scandall and offence that is taken and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, by
rude, customary, and most an end unrightfull Commoners, against the Drayning of
them; as also concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to be nothing els but some great Bog or Quagmire
lying so flat as is not Draynable.</p>
                     <p>3. Because my self was once before I knew them in some
measure thus deceived, but especially because the report of the Country people
was as one man, that the undertakers Dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had no whit at all advantaged
them, but that their Fen Lawes and Commission of sewers, and the works they
made through that authority, and by the directions and meanes they used, had
brought the Fens into as good a posture as all he undertakers works, (the which
my self was hardly <pb n="49" facs="tcp:54116:38"/> drawn to believe) endeavouring hereby
to suggest the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of ever accomplishing a perfect Drayning, so that
many not knowing that the fall is considerable in it self, and very great into
the Sea by reason of the Ebbing of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will thereby give opportunity
unto a most compleat Dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, that by this information I may quicken all
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Spirits to the helping on the work so advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Common
good, and yet so fecible, I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the Fens of <hi>England</hi> to
lie in some proportionable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to those great Rivers and gallant Meadows
adjoyning to them in many eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and
less descending Countries, onely with these two observations.</p>
                     <p>1. That these Fens are nearer the Sea, the Center of the
waters, and so we must conceive the fall or descent to be the lesser; for as
our lesser Brooks run quicker than our great Streams, and the bigger the stream
and nearer the Sea any great River runneth, the slower by far the water
descendeth, and flatter the Land lyeth, so the Fens being a far vaster and
greater compass lye more flatter, and the Rivers run the slower.</p>
                     <p>2. Because these Fen-Lands being far greater, and many times
more broader than our greatest Meadowes, therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covered with water,
and lying more levell, will not Drain so fast, and so can not hold comparison
in each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, yet a more suitable Modell to describe them by, to those
that know them not, I cannot Frame.</p>
                     <p>So that the Fen-Lands so called are as I may say, great
Meadows covered over with water in the time of a great Land-flood; for as upon
great raines the Rivers or Water-courses in the uplands are not able to contain
the Floods,<note place="margin">The just Form or Modell of the Fen-lands.</note>
neither are the Fen Rivers Sewers or water-courses able to take away those
Floods that come out of the higher Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or uplands aforesaid. And as the
small brooks first o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow, because of the disproportion betwixt those narrow
watercourses, and the floods that run in them, and are unflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, when or
before the great Rivers begin to rise, and the Flood of the great Rivers
continue longer than the lesser, <pb n="50" facs="tcp:54116:39"/> so the Fen Rivers or
Water-courses being much lesser, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their great Floods than the
little brooks are, they can not contain their own water Floods, with the Rivers
and Floods of the upland Countries too; but are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced over the banks into
that great Flat or Levell of Fen-land and Meadow on both sides their
Water-courses, and being there dispersed many miles into a great breadth and
length, &amp; being ever and anon relieved with fresh Land-Floods, most part of
Winter long continue, neither having a great fall nor large
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>omthy Water-courses into the Sea,
nor other artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Receptacles to receive them, cannot so truly nor
sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly run off again, but had they Water-courses proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable either in
Number or Greatness, to other great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, they would most of them drain
themselves, and return to as perfect Meadow and Pasture as any in
<hi>England,</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Land-floods and Rivers that lye on the same
side of the Country the Fens lye on, from the highest part of the up-lands, run
into and through the Fens to the Sea, as their constant course, &amp; if the
Spring be kindly and moderatly dry, the Fen-water runneth and dryeth away
apace, and many times in <hi>February</hi> or the entrance of <hi>March,</hi>
especially when the winds sit fair, that is, to drive the waters Sea-ward, they
are grazeable with great cattell, and many times with Sheep too, and some part
of them are all Winter dry and never drowned, and many of those keep as much
stock of cattell, especially of sheep, all Winter, as ever I saw any Common or
pasture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hay. And to conclude this description whereby you may not
onely frame out a Model of the Fens, but discover the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibility, if not the
only way of Drayning them, which ushe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in my second particular, which

Mountaines and Rockiness betwixt the place you desire to drain, and the Sea, or
River into which you must draw your drain, that it may make the work so
chargeable, as the profits thereof will not counterpoise.</p>
                     <p>2. Also there may be such a Vein of Earth, as is so Moorish,
or exceeding Sandy, upon which you must be forced to plant your Sluces, or
Water-gates, as besides the extraordinary charge of Workmanship, may much
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the continuance of the Work, and so with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary charge, and
great hazard, may render the fruits therof below the expences. These things are
possible, yet not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Second Hindrance may be in the People,</hi> The
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, and they may, and do much hinder it in reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Work it

that would indeavour it. But the greatest hindrance is their unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to

of it. A little season lost, may lose the cost and works of a whole Summer, and
whilest neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors are contesting about the quality of their Levies, and
disputing every mans Right to pay, and gathering up their moneys, the Works may
run further backward in a week, than they were brought forward in a month. I

this; these works creep forward, but run <pb n="52" facs="tcp:54116:40"/> post backward.
Again, the combination of labourers and Poor people may very much prejudice,

as I desire not to discourage any Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirits; so neither do I desire to
fawn upon the most ablest Artist, but do hereby affirm, that the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,
or Artist in this Work, may exceedingly Eclipse the Common Good, and through a
corrupt selfish Spirit may monopolize to his private advantage particular mens
Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and in and under pretence of doing a Common Good, may utterly ruin
thousand souls. Corrupt self, or Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self will endeavour this; but
an Ingenious Spirit scorns perfidiousness; yet many an Undertaker may in these
respects be an hindrance to the prosperity of Fen-drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he be upon a
publick Work, for private I meddle not withall.</p>
                     <p>1. If that he lay not out a good Foundation, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly spoils it, or at least bungles out a half work, and leaves the Cream
behind him, and it destroyes it self at last.</p>
                     <p>2. If that men shall pick and cull their Lands, drayn those
that are more fecible, and leave out those that are more difficult, I say he is
an enemy to the Common good; And this is a Maxim I shall declare, Drain the
worst, and the best will drain it self; and sometimes the lowest Lands may, if
thoroughly drained, prove the best Lands, and be the speediest and easiest way
to drain the whole.</p>
                     <p>3. If that men drain those Lands wherein they are like to
have an interest, throughly, and those the Commoners have, more overly; or
imbank, or secure the one from land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floods, and not the other; or if he make
not such a through <pb n="53" facs="tcp:54116:40"/> drain of all as may go to the bottom,
and lay it sound at root, I am sure he will not attain the End, the best fruit
and advantage the Lands will yeeld; which that it may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, I shall

then</p>
                     <p>3. Whether all Water-courses that are made for drains must
not widen, biggen, and strengthen proportionable both to the Land-floods that
come out of the upper Countries, as also proportionable to the waters, or
downfalls that come from Heaven, and fall upon the said Lands? And so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

whether in drayning the Fens from their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall waters and moisture, or
in preserving them from the Land-floods that come from the high Lands? If the
great difficulty be to preserve them from the Land-floods <pb n="54" facs="tcp:54116:41"/>
of other Lands, as to me seems probable; then whether it would not be more
really advantagious to a perfect drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to take off the Land-floods at or
before their entrance into the Fens, and so carry them along the Fen-side,

take in the last undertaking, who <hi>una voce</hi> cry out that the
Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers secured their own by banks, and preserved them from the
Land-floods, and drowned all the Commoners side as much as ever, and that by
every considerable Flood? And if this be granted, then I dare conclude the Fen
will drain it self with a small course, and with greater speed, and more
certainty, as well as more substantially; And so I shall onely move this
further, and so refrain.</p>
                     <p>6. Whether if any of the aforesaid particulars be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
then must not of necessity all the Out-lets or Mouths of all the Master-work,
and Sluces, and Water-gates, be wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made proportionable to your higher
courses, lest that the water receive a check thereby, either to force your
Sluces or give a recoil to the waters into the Fen again, I mean proportionable
as well in greatness of the fall, as to the bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I shall onely now desire to know whether when the
Master-drains are made substantially deep, it will not be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o most advantage to divide the
lands into lesser divisions by small draines, than to cast them out into
greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions? yet I shall not prescribe so small as some do, but into
the most convenientest divisions may be for the compleat draining.</p>
                     <p>And as to Sluces, Water-gates, Locks, &amp;c. I shall say
little, because they are under the command of Rule, and Truth of Workmanship;
and a good experienced Millwright or Engineer is well able to regulate them to
as much Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for close shutting, and suitable opening, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming 
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54116:41"/> of the Tide, or out-going of the Floods, as the
variousness of opportunities will require, which I forbear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they
cannot easily be described without figures.</p>
                     <p>And as to the severall Tooles to be used in the working of
these Water-courses, they are common, and most of them in common use upon the
Fens, except a good water-levell, which I have at large described in the tenth
Chapter, which is most essentially necessary for the casting or laying out of
all the Works therof, and a Trenching Plough to cut out the first Works, and
the Turfing Spade, all largely described in the next Chapter.</p>
                     <p>I shall onely speak a word or two to the Improvement of some
particular parcels of Fen-lands which in themselves are drainable, and without
the least dependauce upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral draining, although I will not say but
such Land would more easily be drained in the generall, than it will be done of
it self; yet seriously pondering all things in one even bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, there may be
little difference, and that upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; if it be done as a member of
the General,<note place="margin">Some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

  though the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall be not.</note> then it must contribute to the generall
charge, and share in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall breaches or miscarriage, and in all
paaticulars stand and fall therewith; Also then it is subject to the same
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, as the generall is, of prejudice, by reason of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that
may arise betwixt the Owners, Proprietors, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, Undertakers, or
whosoever, which may be very many, and so great, as may tend to the ruin of the
whole, which without dependance thereupon it will not be. And I am confident,
some very considerable parcels of Lands lie so convenient, and so fecible unto
the Work, that they may be done most easily; and others lye more difficultly,
and will be done more chargeably; All which I shall hold forth under these two
descriptions.</p>
                     <p>1. Are all Lands that lye somewhat higher of
themselves,<note place="margin">All such-Lands are most fecibl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

drowned (unless it be by some extraordinary Inundation) of themselves, these
are most easily recovered of themselves, at a little more charge than any
common Lands are inclosed, and that by one good substantiall Dike, well turfed
(or sodded, as the Fen-men call it) on the outside <pb n="56" facs="tcp:54116:42"/> round
about the same, and well rammed and beaten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it need neither be very
broad nor high, the height and weight of the water offending will discover that
unto you, nor indeed cost any more than the charge of a good quick Dike, which
every good Husband bestowes upon a new division; and I dare say there are many
thousands of Acres of Lands in many parts of the Fens of this nature.</p>
                     <p>2. The Second is the more difficult, and yet very fecible
also, and that is certain Creeks or corners of Land
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>unning into the up-lands, and upon
the out-skirs of the Fens, and many out-borders that are onely anoyed with
their own, and the swellfng of the naturall Fen-waters, and are cleer from any
Land-floods, or up-land waters running through them, and have one or two sides
firm, and the securing of one or two sides more will secure the whole. These
are easily drainable without dependance upon the draining of the whole Fen, and
that by a more substantiall imbanking than the former, to secure it self from
the great waters of all other Fens, and then there will onely rest to resolve
how to drain it self; to which I shall onely say, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well provided
against the waters of bordering Fens, find out the lowest part of all thy
Lands, and thither draw a good substantial Master-drain through all thy Lands,
and there plant a water-Engine, which may either be wrought by the wind, or by
the strength of horse, yea possibly by the strength of two or three men; which
if the compass of thy Land be not great, and thy water small, may be but a very
inconsiderable charge. And thy Engines may also be divers; as an Engine or
Windmill may with a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-wheel, planted in thy Water-course, or Master-drain,
or very near unto it, which water-wheel must be made to that height as may be
sure to take out the bottom of the water, and deliver it at the middle of the
wheel, which wheel may be contrived into such a form,<note place="margin">Water

as that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, as I may call them, or Peals, or Scoops, as others call
them, will cast up, and cast out the water to a considerable height, as a man
doth with a hand-scoop, pail, or kit cast water out of a ditch, which Engine
shall at large here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after <pb n="57" facs="tcp:54116:42"/> both be described, and the form
of it delineated, or else by a good chain-pump, or bucket-work, both which may
be made into a Wind-mil-Engine, or else with an Engine made with a perpetual
Screw; all which for that height as is requirable to the draining of such a
Work, wil lay a good compass of Land dry in a few daies, and if time prevent
not, shall most of them be described at large.</p>
                     <p>3. But a Third is most difficult, which I yet conceive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
fecible, and may be recovered also to a great advantage: And that is such a
parcel of Land that lieth also at a skirt,<note place="margin">These more
  difficult, and yet fecible.</note> or out-side of the Fen, although it may have
some Land-flood running through it, or near it; which Land-flood, if it be
possible either to divert it on the one hand or the other, of the Land you
desire to drain, or else if it be be a small Floud, within the compass and
power of an Engine, may also be drainable, and by the aforesaid direction of
inbank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Land, to secure the Land-flouds from comming on at at all, which
with a reasonable Bank, and a fair open passage to convey the Land-flouds
clenly away, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the fear therof; And then a fair Master-drain down
through the lowest ground, or neer the middle of the Fen you desire to drain,
which must be made so deep, as that it may substantially draw all cold corrupt
water into it self: I prescribe no depth, because I cannot give to all sorts of
Fen-lands (no nor to any other by measure) a suitable and necessary proportion
so far from off the place where it is to be made, and this drain to be
continued to that place where you have most conveniencie to land your wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and there planting one of the aforesaid Engines, I shall leave every of them to
each mans own affection. I know they will every one do the Work, and that a
very inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable charge, to the profits and advantages to be received and
reaped hereby. I shall say no more in this case, because I much more desire the
general Work, which will make all these particulars to come on the easier, The
draining of the whole Fens; yet considering the rubs that lie in the way of the

                  <div n="4" type="section">
                     <head>Now to proceed to the Fourth generall Head of this
discourse, to set forth the best way of Improvement of the aforesaid
Lands.</head>
                     <p>I shall say the less, because through my whole discourse it
is my main Scope, and so shall confine my self onely to some of those
particulars more peculiar to these Lands, though being substantially drained,
they are capable of the impress of any Husbandry whatsoever; I shall therfore
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Fen-lands into three sorts. First, The sound dry Land, seldom, or
never drowned. The Second shall be your constant drowned Lands in times of
great Flouds. And the Third shall be your lowest Land of all, that lieth
constantly so wet and cold, that it is turned into a very Moor or Bog.</p>
                     <p>1. Your dry Lands, I for the present account them the very
best, and most capable of raising the greatest present profit, I shall
therefore (because it is fruitfull of it self to grass, and will yeeld advance
enough thereby, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there will be enough for many years of the
other two sorts remain to husbandrize, and toss and tumble up and down)
perswade to lay it all for pasturage, until your other Lands be perfectly
recovered and improved; but this may prove undoubtedly excellent Hemp-land,
Oad-land, &amp; may be, Mather-land, and most excellent, yea rather too good
for Cole and Rape-seed, because there will be other wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, enough for
that.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54116:43"/>2. To the second sort, only drowned by
up-land flouds, &amp; so lie dry when the floud is gone, I say, if this be not
lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened with coldness, or steeped so w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> constant corrupt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that it
is turned into a moorishness, but yet remaines perfect Land, and clear Soard,
this very Land may prove your best Land in a little time, and therefore I shall
onely for the reducing hereof, advise to a moderate plowing of it; and for the
reducing of it to perfect soundness, advise to raise it every plowing, dividing
each ground into lands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three yards over, or thereabout, which will take
two casts of seed, and in five or six tilths will rise up to so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient a
height, as will lay it sound and dry, and increase your Land also; yet however
you must not endeavour the laying any Land any higher than your drains will be
sure to draw your furrows: But in case the Level of your water will not admit
you to raise up your Lands to so good a height, then you were best make your
Lands somewhat les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and then the fewer plowings will lay them round and
sound: but be carefull not to make your last furrow alwais in one place, but in
each plowing shift one furrow, or more, sometimes one way, and somtimes
another, and this wil preserve the furrow from overmuch barrenness.</p>
                     <p>This Land may be suitable and very excellent for Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed,
and coming to its perfect soundness for most of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid opportunities,
but exceeding rich for all sorts of Grain, out of question, onely I shall
earnestly perswade not to plow too oft, nor impoverish it too much at first,
for hereby most men undo their Lands. I conceive it best not to plow any of
these Lands no longer than it is brought into a perfect Tilth, or one year
after, three years may do best, though four years may do well, and you will
find a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant sweet Turf succeed, and soard thick suddenly and sweetly, and
your succeeding profits, all things consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may reach your very benefit of
corning to a very neer scantling. I have heard very many object that matchless
prejudice by so tedious and thin Soarding, and have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they have tried
it by experience, and find plowing wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully destructive; And if you should
demand how many years they plowed it, they must needs answer, some 5, some 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54116:44"/> 6, some 7, some 8, and some 10, and others more; and if
you again ask them how they laid it down, they must say for the general, they
cast them down, and left an open Ridge to grass; and if you should again demand
upon what stubbles or eadish did you lay down your Land for grass, some say
upon the Peas stubble, or Barley, and here &amp; there one upon the Oats, which
is better than either of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but none say upon Wheat or Rie, which I
as highly commend, and for the first yeares Soarding goes beyond them all; they
neither bestowed any soil upon it first, nor so much as a few hay-seeds at
laying down, and yet they will tell you a story of I know not what experiences
they have made, when alas they never knew that an Experiment must hold in all
its parts, and relate to times, seasons, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well as fruit and crop,
and so bring an ill report upon the best husbandry, and stifle their own
greatest gain. But of this no more, because in other parts of the Book it is
more largely discussed, yet bear with me if repeated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is the
discovery of the husbanding of a new World, as a man may call it.</p>
                     <p>I proceed to the Third sort,<note place="margin">A new World
  may best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of new Husbandry</note> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is your lowest land of all, and
lieth deep and long drowned, that it is even turned to very Turf or Bog, and
very little useful, onely two or three months in summer it is commonable; but
whether profitable or no, I scarce know, nor (being a stranger both in those
parts, &amp; to those Lands) will I be peremptorily confident in any thing, as
will not hold proportion and use with other Lands; I shall therefore only
question whether in comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon
these Lands they do not oft stiflle their cattell in the morishest places;
&amp; whether they rot them not, or choke them not, through many uncurable
diseases by reason of the unwholsomness of their pasturage. This I dare affirm,
I have seen many poor thin cattel, which have brought <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean
ill favoured kine into my mind, and such truly as I have not so familiarly seen
upon heathy barren Commons, ten Acres whereof is not worth one of these, and
yet thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands are prejudiced against the draining of them; but to the Land it
self, being recovered and laid dry, it will require more time to recover it
self than the other better Lands, &amp; <pb n="61" facs="tcp:54116:44"/> require more cost
and husbandry to bring it to Fertility; and though all the preceding directions
are, or may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable here unto it in their propor Seasons, yet some other
work may be more naturall as a ground-work to other Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, and that
chiefly upon your hassocky morish rough Land, the which being left to grass, I
cannot conceive it worth in its present state not above 3 or 4<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. <hi>per</hi>
Acre, and some under, and yet that very same Land, by paines and patience may
recover to be very good Land immediately. I shall therefore advise that this
Land be turved, or as some call it,<note place="margin">Denshi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

denshired, that is, all the hassocks cut up, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turf parted up, and
all laid upon little heaps till throughly dry, and then burned to ashes, and if
it be all stringy, rooty, and very combustible matter, then the thicker you
pare it up the better; for although I differ from many of the West-Country
Husbands about this denshiring their thin turved Lands, that are pure from
roots, twitch, or moss, conceiving (that though it bring their Land into sudden
Tillage, and to yeeld out it's Spirit the first year) it weakens the Land
much,<note place="margin">Denshiring lands reproved in the West.</note> there
being no addition to it but a few bushels of ashes to an Acre, in stead of good
Turf or Soard, that in a Summers working will be easily brought to Tillage, and
(as I believe) ads more by far to the fatting of the Land than those ashes do;
and I am sure, when any one layeth down his lands to grass, upon this
Husbandry, the Soard comes pale and wan, and very lean and low, and never
riseth to a good Crop, and whosoever seriously observes the same, shal find
that very issue; yet to Lands of this nature I as highly extoll it,<note place="margin">Burning Land extolled in the North.</note> and to all such foul
Lands, where is depth of soil enough, and all so combustible as nothing else
will work it unto Tillage. In the midst of <hi>May,</hi> or any time in the
very beginning of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when the Land is thorough dry, is best, and the
earliest also, that you may have as much of the Summer as you can, to the
working of your other Tillages, which being burned in a dry season, proceed to
plowing and ridging up your Lands, and dividing them into such proportions as
your drains will bear, as is directed in the aforesaid last particular, &amp;
this will then be fit to take the impress of any seed; much of this will bear
Cole-seed, or any grain, which I leave to the <pb n="92" facs="tcp:54116:45"/> discretion
of the Country Experiences, onely pray you study laying all sound and warm;
plow not too long, and lay it down to grass either upon the Oat-stubble, which
will soard exceeding well the second year, if not the first, or upon wheat or
Rie, the Land harrowed and laid very smooth; this will soard excedingly the
first year, as in other places of the Book. I have at large discoursed. And as
your Land recovers sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, you will by your improving your own experiences,
have more Talents added to these, you have more opportunities to raise

                        </gap> advantages out of them.</p>
                     <p>Now to the conclusion of this Chapter,<note place="margin">Lands drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Sea.</note> I shall onely add a word or two
of Sea-drowned Lands, and it shall be very little, because as to the
improvements of them whatever hath been before spoken and applied to other
Lands, may be to these, which being once recovered, are very sound dry Land
many of them, and the rest may be reduced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by good divisions and
draines, as in all other Marsh-Lands.</p>
                     <p>All the mystery of this is in the recovery of them, which to
discourse at large, would be more tedious than profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because as to the
materials for imbanking or bounding the Sea, whether Stone, Chalk, Wood, or
Earth, little can be said, because all must be referred to the conveniency and
necessity of the place upon which they are requirable, onely there must be
great regard had to the force of the Sea that lies upon them, and the strength
and violence of the winds to which it lyeth most obnoxious; for I am perswaded
it is not so oft the Sea it self that makes the breach, as the strength of the
winds that forceth it over the banks; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I prescribe the severall
Locks or Water-gates necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for letting out the Heavens water, nor the
bigness or strength of them, that being proper to the place upon which they are
to be erected, there to be discoursed and described, and the common Engineers
are very customarily used therto; As to some good ingenious painfull Artist,
little can be added, so that there remaines only that I advise to these two or
three general directions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> That you be very carefully observant of the
power and way of the Seas working; for although it is possible much 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54116:45"/> Lands may be gained from the Sea, yet it is not possible
at all times to keep the same when it is gained; therefore where-ever you see
the Sea get or recover upon any Land, be wary there, rather study to stop the
Sea there on the borders, and to divert the force of it another way, which will
sometime more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive a check than at other times and places; but if
that be not stayable, I should advise not to be too busy there, but where the
Sea loseth, and Land increaseth, there is a more probable opportunity, and
there I should rather pitch down my staff. There is store of these Lands to be
recovered, so that I would not perswade any to streighten themselves with
hazards and inconveniences, when there is such a wide opportunity for the
ingenious to improve both parts and purses on the borders of these Nations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be very carefull of placing your out-fals
and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-gates in so convenient parts as may both be best for the firm
draining of your Lands, and for the firm founding of your Sluces and
Water-gates, both in relation to the Earth you plant them on, and the force or
strength of the water that lieth against them, or accidentally through some
fierce storm that may come upon them; this hath been the overthrow of some
gallant works, and particular rules here cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed but through so
much tediousness as will tire thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which I must forbear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Be above measure studious about thy
Imbank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that a foundation be so firmly laid to the bottom with such
materialls as will hold out the triall; therefore in every new work some triall
would be made of all materials, and therein thou must be steered by those the
very place affords, whether Stone, Chalk, Wood, or Earth, or all, and the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent experience upon the place will be a better Tutor than I can possibly,
for I much question whether the carriage of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these far, will answer the
cost or hazards run therein. Be sure your foundation be broad, well ramm'd
together, and so raised with solid matter and workmanship a good height above
the highest Tides, and curiously turved or sodded on the Sea-side; the better
is your Turf the firmer is your work; for if that it once begin to hole, or
break, look to the main, it is in danger, and ever be sure your new works be
made the <pb n="94" facs="tcp:54116:46"/> highest, because an overflowing upon an old work
is not so dangerous as upon the new, that it quickly and easily
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> Be sure of ingenious and laborious workmen;
an idle slubberer will both deceive the work and Master, study not so much
cheap wages, as to have your work well done for good wages; carefull ingenious
Overseers of the Labourers is an unvalued furtherance to the work, some men
have an excellent <hi>Genius</hi> that way, will awe men more with their wise
industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oversight, and skill in mens frame of Spirits, and wise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
each man to his place and work, that al of them shal be as members of the body,
co-adjutors to the whole, one take it from another, so as no work be done twice
over, nor one mans labour bear out another mans sloth, but each be helpfull to
another,<note place="margin">A Good Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer worth Gold.</note> so as to advance
the main. I tell you this is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and a man rightly qualified for this
work is worth gold, and very rarely to be found. I have seen some Bayliffs
intrusted herein, stand telling a story, while all his workmen have stood
looking him in the face, admiring him for his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, and this hath pleased
him as well as their working; many have an easie way of hindering work, but few
of further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and he is a rare man that can sort all his works so into
each workmans hand, as that it goes on to purpose; confusion is through
ignorance and sloth; a good method, or plat-form to advance each mans labour to
the best furtherance of a work, is difficult, requires great ingenuity, and
laborious study, I find it most difficult, though I have had as large
experience of it as most Englishmen, yet cannot accomplish it, but many times
ran into confusion, through mens rudeness, and my want of each particular
experience in each work, the which I instance as a Rock for others, to beware,
and prize and value a good Overseer, whose countenance and conversation is such
with workmen, as will not onely awe and force them, but his wise and loving
demeanor will compel them to their utmost faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; a work in its geares
will thrive exceedingly. And so I have done at present with this particular,
till I have gained some more, and new experiences; and with this Chapter.</p>

 simple, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out severall motions, or divisions, made onely for ease,
 lightness, and quickness, not for Admiration or Confusion.</p>
                  <p>The first is a good Line about thirty two yards long, made of
 the best Water-wrought Hemp, and as big again as Whipcord,<note place="margin">A
good Line.</note> upon a good Reel to wind it upon; I prescribe this length
 because of drawing all Workes as near unto a strait Line as possible may be;
 which length is of use in measuring your Work by the Pearch or Rod as you
 desire also, and no more of this.</p>
                  <p>The second is a Water Levell about five foot long, the longer
 the better,<note place="margin">A Water-Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.</note> but that it will be the

 removing, that it is not worth prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing.</p>
                  <p>Others have used them of seven or eight foot long, to be
 placed on two or three legs, as the Surveyor placeth the plain Table, the

 to come up in two Cups (above the wood) planted in the Levell, and sights

 five foot and an half long, made of the best young seasoned Oak that can be
 got; my Levell, or the Barrell of it, is but four foot and an half, or five
 foot long, which Barrell in the midst of it, is planted into the top of my
 Staff thus; Just upon the midst of my Barrell is a pair of Iron joynts
 curiously wrought into the very middest of my Barrell, on the neather side of
 it, and at the very over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of my Staff, and so much of the one part of my
 Staff, and just half the length of my Barrell taken away with a moulding or
 rabating plain, untill both joyned together with these joynts make one compleat
 Staff straight and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, onely about a quarter of an Inch taper upward,
 from the bottom to the top; that it may not be too top-heavy, and the Sights
 are to be fixed unto both ends of the Levell Barrell, that they stand firm and
 hold water, and yet are very little or no annoyance, either to Sight or

 Pike in the bottom of the Staff, and a step to set the foot, or force it into
 the ground where there is no occasion to use <pb n="67" facs="tcp:54116:47"/> it; And in

 it up again,<note place="margin">Who are the makers of it.</note> and walk as

 Gun-smiths will make the Wooden-work also with direction, but properly it
 belongeth to the Joyner.</p>
                  <p>The next is the Trenching-Plough, or Coulter; whose speciall
 use is to cut out the Trench on both sides with great expedition,<note place="margin">The Trenching Plough.</note> which is thus made; Take a Piece of

 run upon the ground, and just above the neck must be an Iron, or little Coulter
 about the strength of a Butchers Knife, planted in the Stayl, where the Stayl
 must be plated with Iron, curiously let into the Wood on both sides, through
 which, as also the Wood, the tange of the Coulter must come, with a Cotter-hole

                  <p>Whose use is, when that thou hast cast out thy Trench, and set
 thy Line, thou mayst with this run along thy Line, and cut out one side of thy

 and cut it out also; but if thou studiest more exactness, then in the foot of

 the foot may bear it self a little upon the Wheel, which will occasion it to
 run more pleasantly; but the Wheel must also be curiously planted into the foot
 with Plates, and upon an Iron Axel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, wherwith thou mayst cut out a Pearch
 whilst some will be cutting out two yards, and more true and certain; and so
 also mayst thou use it speedily to cut out thy Tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great use, which thou must preserve most choicely, for
 therewith thou mayest cover thy bare places of Earth, or any low places that
 thou wouldest raise up to a Levell, and mayst have as good Grass upon it within
 half a year, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than upon the other Lands; For the taking up of which Turf
 thou must make a Spade on purpose, with a bit look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up twice so much as our
 ordinary Spades do,<note place="margin">Turving Spade.</note> with a curious thin
 shoo looking up also; whose bit must be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well steeled, and more
 broader at the point, or neather end of the bit, than at the over end, of about
 half an inch, and not above by no meanes; which will take up the Turf, all at
 one thickness, just at the naturall height a man useth it, as he stands to
 shovell Earth before him. This Spade is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable usefull to cleanse the
 bottom of Trenches, for which use it were very necessary to have another an
 inch and half narrower than the former, for lesser and narrower Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
 which Spades (the broadest sort of them) are more speedy, and more easie for
 Banking and Levelling high places and great Ant-hills, by far, than other
 Common Spades are.</p>
                  <p>The next Tool that is to be shadowed to thee is the Trenching
 Spade,<note place="margin">The Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spade.</note> which you may make
 betwixt Four and Five Inches broad, and if you make Two, which is better, One
 may be Four Inches, and the other may be Six Inches wide, whose Tree must be
 made more compass and looking up, by far, than your usuall Spades are, yea
 somewhat more compass than your Turving Spade is, though but a very little, so
 that it may carry a Trench Levell before you, being forced by your strength of
 Arm, guided from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bottom of your Belly, as you use the Shovell in any
 thing you cleanse; which Spade shoo must be made with two sides, or Langets, up
 from the end of the bit, like as if you would plant two broad Knife Blades to
 look upwards with their points upon a common Spade, from <pb facs="tcp:54116:48"/>

 they must be made a little stronger, yet they need not be above two inches
 broad at the very bit, and as thin as the strength of the work will bear,
 little thicker than a strong Knife, and so Narrower and Narrower upwards,
 untill it come to half an inch, and about Five Inches long, which must be made
 very exact, and true, smooth and sharp, otherwise it it will not work forth his
 Coar, and Furrow clearly, and easily, but will be above a mans naturall
 strength; but if it be rightly made, any

                     </gap>an may easily work forth a Trench
 at one time, and very fast, almost as fast as a man can thrust a Shovell under
 a little Sand or Dung before him. Some have assayed to make this Trenching
 Spade rudely and in other formes, which I will not stand here to disprove,
 because their own Experience hath laid down the use of them, but this I am
 certain of in my own knowledge is wonderfull usefull, and herewith one man may
 do more in such work as this (which to make greater Trenches is but to make
 more work to no purpose) and that more formally and Artificially, than six men
 can do with their own naturall and usuall Tooles, and they shall moyl and spoyl
 less ground by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which Tool so cutteth out his Furrow and Coar,
 that you may within a week or two, or when you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished your desire,
 lay it down again, and no whit prejudice the least Grass, and none shall be the
 wiser for it, or Discover within two or three dayes whether such a thing was
 yea or no, and so will prevent the least spoyl.</p>
                  <p>There is another Tool or two as usefull in these works,<note place="margin">The paring Spade.</note> and no less necessary, and this is the
 Paring Spade, or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Iron, whose bit may be made all of Iron, being a
 strong Iron Plate with a good strong Socket, to put a straight tough Stale or
 Helve into, it must be made just straight every way, the Bit must be made
 twenty Inches long, the two sides and neather end all well steeled, the neather
 part of the bit a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bellied or square, and the sides a little hollow or

 Improve his Lands by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasturing, and Enclosing of it, whereby he may raise
 more profit in Sheep, Wools, Cattell, and far more Corn also if he please upon
 every Acre.</p>
                  <p>For the discovering a little these self deceivers to
 themselves, I shall speak a word or two more large to each Extreme.</p>
                  <p>The first Extreme is partly through so deep an Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of
 Tillage and plowing in Common, although it be to his perpetuall slavery and
 drudgery all his dayes, he will not leave it, and especially through a
 prejudice he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against Enclosure through some mens depopulation and
 oppression, and destruction of Tillage, that he will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove hereof upon
 any Tearmes, but oppose with all the might and main he can; what saith he,
 Enclose, depopulate, destroy the poor? no, our fathers lived well upon their
 land without Enclosure, kept good hospitality, many servants, and bred up many
 children, and abhominated the thoughts thereof, and so will wee prevent it if
 we can; wee will toyl and moyl all our dayes, and breed up our children to keep
 sheep, horse or beast, kick up their heeles upon a bank, flit our horses, and
 breed them up to take our inheritance of Thirty, Forty, or Fifty pounds by the
 year, with which few can scarce bring both ends together by the yeares end, as
 dayly experience shewes, they not once considering the fruit of Idleness, not
 the great Improvement of this honest equall Enclosure, nor their childrens ruin
 for want of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Trade, or good breeding, the least whereof is better, or
 may be better to them than all their lands. Witness <pb n="74" facs="tcp:54116:51"/>
 thousands in England that prefer their children better with a little good
 breediug, with little portion, than they can or usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do with all their
 inheritance.</p>
                  <p>The second extreme is as like the former as can be, and is so
 prejudiciall to the Common-Wealth, and destructive to good husbandry, and it
 ariseth out of base private hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of sloth and self-will, and want of a wise
 Spirit of discerning in Improvements, and because he seeth some men have abused
 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Pasture-Land by over
 plowing, and took out the Spirit and life thereof, that it will not come to it
 self of many yeares (which is an ill piece of providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) therefore he
 will not plow any old Pasture Land at all, upon any tearmes, or for any time,
 no though his Land be so decayed and impoverished, that that Land which would
 have maintained much cattell, will not now maintain so much by one third part
 or a quartern, as it did after the first through soarding: and by reason either
 of the wet and cold year, or the overpowring of the moss or Anthills, or some
 other trash, it puts not that proof into Cattell, nor scarce half, as it did at
 the first Soarding; nay though it calls loud for plowing, and will be much
 bettered, and the Rent doubled, yet he will not have it plowed come what will;
 What saith he, destroy my old Pasture, my sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walkes, and beggar my Land? all
 the world shall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to that, you may as soon perswade him not to
 eat good wholesome food, because some men overcharged their stom acks by
 excesse herein; because here and there an indiscreet man did wrong his Land by
 excessive plowing, he will not use it at all, not moderately, though he may
 Mend or better it thereby; No saith he, I can raise a constant profit by my
 Wool and lamb, my fat beef and mutton, at an easie quiet way unto my self and
 family without much vexing or turmoyling, (which is a gallant way of living,
 and I shall exceedingly advise and commend it too, until the Land de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
 and calls out for plowing, or the Common-wealth calls out for corning, and will
 yeeld far better advance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by) he takes more content in a Sheep-heard and
 his dogg, and in his own will and ease, than in greater advantage; and 
 <pb n="75" facs="tcp:54116:51"/> as the other Extreme will hinder all Improvements he can
 by way of Enclosure under pretence of overthrowing Tillage (though a man may
 till as much &amp; get far more Corn in Pasture than in Common if he will) so
 will this out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as vain and
 senseless pretences hinder all Corning in pasture, lest he should prejudice his
 Land for grazing, although he may moderate corning, and better his Land to
 grazing also; so have I erected a Sea-mark upon both these Rocks, that all men
 may take heed of dashing themselves thereon, the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous I am sure will
 never come near them. But for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the first extreme maintayned by
 that generation of strange men that oppose Enclosure, yet see every day the
 Rents of those Lands Improved, some doubled, some more, some less, and the Land
 certainly advanced by it, one Acre made worth three or four, and after a while
 will bear more Corn without soyl for three or four year, than divers Acres as
 it was before in Common, that onely say Enclosure may as easily be made without
 depopulation as with it; and to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Extreme.</p>
                  <p>I am not ashamed maintain, as a reproof to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, that
 many ten thousand Acres of Land in <hi>England,</hi> may yeeld a double profit
 divers yeares, by plowing, and afterwards yeeld as much rent as ever before,
 and possibly much more; Nay, I'll say, observe my Directions punctually; and
 I'll make good the old Rent the very first year, after Plowing, and begin to
 enter upon it as soon as the Crop is reaped off, and begin my year with Winter
 too, which is accounted the worst advantage to the Tenant, and so for Seven,
 Ten, or Twenty, upon many sorts of Lands in <hi>England</hi> of the aforesaid
 Value; But to stop the mouthes of such Madcaps in each Extreme, and make good
 my Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I will begin and try whether I can hold out Enclosure without
 any Depopulation, or the lest prejudice, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a full answer to
 the rest.</p>
                  <p>And secondly that your Arable or Common Field Lands,<note place="margin">Enclosure held forth without Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation.</note> or common
 Heathes, Moores or Forrests may be highly Advanced; that is out of question I
 suppose, denyed scarce by any, that have had seven years Experience of the 
 <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54116:52"/> Disproportion betwixt the profits of one Lordship in
 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the next adjoyning to it Inclosed; The one worth three hundred
 pounds in Common, the other near a thousand in Pasture.</p>
                  <p>Now here lyeth the Trick indeed to make this Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and
 neither Prejudice Poor, nor Minister, Labourer nor Farmer, Tenant nor Landlord,
 One or Other, that hath any proper Right of interest therein, and not
 Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate.</p>
                  <p>For the holding forth of which, I will Demonstrate such a
 Method, or way of Enclosure (without Depopulation) as all men in particular
 shall have a Proportionable Advance thereby, and the Common Wealth a double or
 Treble, and Tillage advanced also, and so the one Extreme prevented, and no man
 hindred, all which shall admit of no other Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience than this,

                  <p>For the Enclosure of your common field, Arable Land, I lay

                  <p>All which having some Interests more or less, shall be
 se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously considered of.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I begin with the last, the Poor Cottier, or<note place="margin">Cottier provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for.</note> day Labourer, and to provide for
 him, because he hath ever been oppressed if any, and last or least provided
 for, And look what right or Interest he hath in Common, I'll first allot out
 his proportion into severall with the better, rather than with the worse, a
 Proportion out of every mans Inheritauce, and <pb n="78" facs="tcp:54116:53"/> so much, or
 so many Cattell as he may keep in Common, he shall keep in Pasture, or rather
 more, at as easie a rate as they pay for it in Common, for their lives that now
 live upon it, and ever after at an under Value; and so I cannot possibly
 conceive that he hath any cause to be offended.</p>
                  <p>And for the Labourer, you shall see how I shall provide for
 him too before I have done,<note place="margin">Labourer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for.</note>
 besides the allotment of his Proportion, as to the Cottier, or to what Right
 soever he hath of due or Custome.</p>
                  <p>Then for the Minister in the next place, because he hath
 seemed to be the Opposer of it,<note place="margin">Minister pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for.</note> most usually: And truly so he had good reason, as the state of
 things formerly stood with him: (For though I believe that Tithes are neither
 consonant to a <hi>Gospell Minister,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tithes not Gospell
wayes maintenance.</note> (the List of which dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me not, nor I
 intend not to enter in) nor yet Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to a sweet Compliance with his
 people) Yet I also say, that should a Minister either have accepted the peoples
 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of our ordinary <hi>English</hi> Parishes for his pay, Or have
 stood to the Courtesie of the Lord, or Freeholder, what he shonld have had upon
 the Inclosure; I fear, for the one it would have been too little for a
 Ministers Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and for the other, he might go barefoot, and his Family
 a begging, for what the Common people would Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to his Subsistence,</p>
                  <p>And therefore would have him to have his Proportion next, and
 a very substantiall Livelihood allotted out of the Lands inclosed, untill the
 State shall settle a more better or more suitable way of Maintenance for him;
 If there be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Competent number of people for him to preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or
 Competency of Land to raise it from in every Parish, or else two or more
 Parishes that joyn conveniently to be laid together, (And according to what his
 Right or Proportion) (if he have it in way of Tithing) to be inclosed, or cast
 into pasture for him by himself, with as much Conveniency for his dwelling as
 may be.</p>
                  <p>And where either Inclosure cannot be agreed upon, or made (as
 possibly in some parts it may not Consist with all mens advantages) I conceive
 there may be an agreement <pb n="79" facs="tcp:54116:53"/> made for the allotment of the
 Ministers proportion, to be cast into Pasture, so that were his Tenth Enclosed,
 it would be so gallant a maintenance for him and, contentfull to all Parties,
 that it would remove all troubles, or occasion of Confusion, and Increase Love
 and Unity, which Tithings have ever occasioned Divisions and Contentions: Which
 either he may imploy his Wife and Family upon part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for necessary
 Maintenance, And set (with much more ease) the rest to free his Family from
 Care and trouble: And so receive his pay every half year without the least
 Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction. I would have him to have such a large Allotment and Proportion,
 as might inable him to be Capable of Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, of <hi>which he is to be a

                  <p>And as for the great depopulation in the Nation that hath
 devoured poor &amp; Tenant,<note place="margin">Depopulation reproved.</note>
 overthrow Corning and good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, and in some parts Minister and all, and
 yet persist by keeping their Land from Tillage when it wants it; when Country,
 the Landlords profit, the Markets, the Labourer, Poor, and Land it self and all
 calls for it, is no less than grand oppression.</p>
                  <p>As also for other places where no maintainance is assigned for

 things should be mended, is infinitely beyond my Sphere; how Ministers should
 be raised, maintenance and all Interest preserved, I know not; only I shall

                     </note> I question not the Free-holders offence,
 for he having his proportion I know it will be doubled and more to his
 advantage.</p>
                  <p>And for the Tenant let him also share in some Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
 either let him injoy it at an easie rate, that look whatsoever Bargain he hath
 in common by the year, he <pb n="80" facs="tcp:54116:54"/> may have a better upon the

 enjoyes the worst, upon the first Inclosure, so he may have the best also,
 having a good T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rm of time therein,
 and then I hope he will not wrangle neither; for I am sure he need neither Moyl
 nor Cark as he did before, but manage his business with more ease, sweet
 content, and advance of profit.</p>
                  <p>And for the Land-Lord, or Lord, I shall not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak his
 favour,<note place="margin">Lord of the Soyl or Landlord,</note> or Approbation,
 for he will beleeve me without Demonstration, that there will be a visible and
 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable advance fall upon him, onely crave his patience, that he'll not
 be offended, that I seem (and but seem so to do) to project to give away his
 Right as to the Poor, which in Common is their own, whether by Right Custome,
 (for I speak of no other in this place but such as have right of Common) and so
 they may require so much by Law; but to encourage them, and to remove offence
 and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall I advise it. And when all these particulars concerned in their
 severall Rights are satisfied, we shall do well; and yet the great Block and
 Prejudice is yet to be removed, which is, the destruction of Corn, and Tillage,
 which I promised to clear, which followes here.</p>
                  <p>First I indeavour before Enclosure, that either by
 ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments so firm and surely made,<note place="margin">How Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shall
not prejudice the increase of Corn or food.</note> by all parties concerned in
 it, as they may fall under Law to be recovered; Or else by a particular State
 Law enacted to this end, so to ingage all men in this new Inclosure to allot,
 or cast out one third part or thereabout at least of all their Lands constantly
 for Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, or what more at any time they please; One third part for
 Meadow,<note place="margin">Four argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove the advantage by Enclosure,
and that more Corn may be raised being Inclosed than Common.</note> And another
 third part for Pasture, or feeding Land, which third part for Tillage if my
 conceptions fail not, First with the help of all that Soyl that the Hay of the
 other third part will raise in maintaining all the Cattell in Winter, that they
 Pastured in summer upon the other third part, which I conceive may be as many
 more; and also.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by that advantage there will be sometime Plowing on
 Pasture, and resting Another, whereby fresh <pb n="81" facs="tcp:54116:54"/> Land and
 Reitey for some years will bear more Corn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Manure, than it did before
 with it, and indeed also after some yeares of resting may stand in need of
 Plowing, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssibly may advance the Land by it, as I am sure they will all
 our Wood-land, coarser Lands whatsoever, that are either sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Moss,
 or Rush, or Ant-hills, whatever it, will do to better.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, well knowing (that without question) one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of
 well Manured and Husbandryed Land, will yeeld more fruit than two or three
 otherwise; A principle undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, consider the vast advantage there will be by
 Husbandring a little well, I say, it is clear some one Acre manured, plowed and
 hus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>andred in season, and unto that
 height of Richness the Land and seed sowed doth require, may and doth usually
 bear as much Corn as two or three ill husbandred as aforesaid. Then ballance
 the Business, and weigh but the advantage. One Acre beareth the fruit of
 three,<note place="margin">One Acre brings forth as much Corn as three.</note>
 the two Acres are preserved to graze, the seed and all other charges of two
 Acres is preserved to help the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; The Husbandry, and Plowing, and sowing
 of two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres is also saved. Oh consider it, and neither be such Enemies to the
 State, nor of your selves and Common-wealth, so great Abusers of Ingenuity and
 Good Husbandry, so great Tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; When men have their Lands enclosed, and at
 their own command, I fear not but most men will covet to Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry every Acre
 so well, as it may yeeld forth the utmost fruit it is possibly able to produce,
 having the rest at their own Command also, to imploy to another Advantage.
 Which done half the Land in <hi>England</hi> thus managed would yeeld more than
 all that now is under Tillage. This Poor Piece by the by observed, and
 practised, would make good the Improvement promised, consider it well and be
 convinced, or reply.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if you consider that all your Common Fields were
 never under Tillage neither, As great part S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ades and Hade wayes, and a great part Meadow, and much and many
 Balkes between each Land, and many High wayes, and some <pb n="82" facs="tcp:54116:55"/>
 commune of Pastures and Leayes left for keeping Beasts or Sheep upon, all which
 will contain one third part, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if not near half in some places,
 not under Tillage but wast Lands, Certainly I conclude there may be as much
 Corn go by Ingenuity upon this lesser quantity of Ground, and much more being
 inclosed, than upon it all in Common; And that there cannot be any destruction
 of Tillage upon all the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Wasts and
 Grazed parts which ever lay to Grass, and no Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage was upon them, so that I
 must clearly conceive, were one third p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt upon all Enclosure allotted out or covenanted to be kept
 constantly in Tillage, though I advise not to keep the same third part alway in
 Tillage, but sometimes one part, and sometimes another, all making up one just
 third part, would raise as much Corn as all did in Common.</p>
                  <p>And lastly Enclosure cannot destroy Tillage the Staff of the
 Country, because it ever yeelds most profit, nor will, nor need all be
 converted to Pasturage: <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were born and planted
 together, and ordained to live together, and if there were any danger of one
 destroying the other, Tillage is likelyer to destroy Pasturage, because
 <hi>Cain</hi> slew <hi>Abel;</hi> but without a fear the Ploughman and the
 Sheepheard may do best together in a Common-wealth.</p>

                  <p>Also consider the Chiltern Countries, and you shall find, that
 were it al Inclosed men would Plow little or no whit less than now they do,
 because nothing else nor no way else would yeeld the like advance.</p>
                  <p>Consider <hi>Hartfordshirex, Esse, Kent, Surry, Sussex,
 Barkshire, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Somersetshire,</hi> and all the rest, All
 which <pb n="84" facs="tcp:54116:56"/> not onely raise Corn for themselves, but to supply
 that great City that Spends as much as all those Countreyes, and far more: And
 yet no parts of <hi>England</hi> set at greater Rates or makes greater
 Advantages by Grazing, and yet the greatest part thereof upon Tillage, and
 Corning. And what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try not almost though Inclosed, yeelds the greatest
 profit by the Abundance of Corn produced; But if all that I have said be not
 enough, I have enough I am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sure before I have done.</p>
                  <p>As for your Heathes, Moores, and Forrest Lands, I shall onely
 speak thus much, That vast and Incredulous are their Capacities of Improvement
 in generall, referring the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular wayes of Improvement of every sort, and
 differing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Land, as they fall in the fourth or sixt Piece of
 Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement to avoid prolixity, because the very same Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
 Compositions, and Directions, are suitably and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally appliable to these
 Lands, as to those to which they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I onely say that all Interests in these
 Commons,<note place="margin">Onely Right in Commons, not Vsurpers I speak
to.</note> or Rights of Common Pasture, upon any of these Lands, may without
 Prejudice to any particular Interest, be advantaged, and much Improvement made
 to the Publique; I speak not to inright the Usurpers of right wrongfully
 maintained, or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors of any other mens Rights, I desire that Right might
 onely run in its proper Chanell.</p>
                  <p>First in generall by the same Method of Enclosing, held forth
 in this third generall Piece of Improvement, touching Common Field-Lands, if
 thereto, before Enclosure you do but add the Method or Drought of first casting
 out your Lands,<note place="margin">At the first Enclosing of any Common, how to
cast out Land to the greatest Advance.</note> and plotting them into such Plots
 and Formes, so that where there is or may be a Capacity of bringing thy Land
 under any good Stream or Land-flood, be sure to cast it for Meadowing, having
 drawn one Master Level floating course throughout they whole Plot of Enclosure,
 which may also serve as thy first division; and to carry thy water along also
 to flow thy Meadowing thou shalt make all under it fit, that thou mayst not
 lose that Opportunity now at first, (which after divisions made cannot be had)
 of so great an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54116:56"/> at so small a Rate, now at
 thy first contrivance thou mayst cast it under, and then cast out all thy
 Lauds, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the most suitableness of them, all to such Improvements they
 lye under, and then to the Conveniencies of each mans Right and Interest, and
 the greatest Advancement upon these Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures will be two.</p>
                  <p>The first giving all Ingenuous men a Capacity to Plow,<note place="margin">Tow Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of this Enclosure.</note> and Till what they
 please thereof, which will raise a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or treble Advantage, as to Grazing,
 and a Tenfold grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Advance as to Common of Pasture (which to some is worth
 nothing at all, because of their remoteness, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but little, because of
 some great Oppressor, nearely and neatly seated upon the Commons, that drives
 others from it) and to none what it may be, as by right, when he may use all
 his Parts, Purse, and Experiences of Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry at his own pleasure by
 improving it; And it is and never was otherwise seen, that men would ever joyn
 together in one body, to use their utmost to improve any of these Lands to the
 best Advantage; for though Common of Pasture is mens own Inheritance, and every
 man not knowing his Lot,<note place="margin">Cavils against Improvement in
Common.</note> or Portion, how rarely will they ever joyn or agree therein?
 although they are all perswaded of a probable great Advancement, yet one sayes,
 I shall not have so great an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it as my neighbour; and another he
 believes it will be good for present, but it will not last; and an another
 sayes, he hath no reason to bear so great a proportion of Charge, though he
 have as much Land, yet he's not capable of so great an Improvement; and another
 saith, I could be well content to help on any publique work, if others would,
 but for me to bestow cost and improve my Land, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for others that
 will bestow none to eat and bite up my cost, much discourageth him, and indeed
 there is some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for his backwardness; and a thousand Excuses and Cavils
 there must be, which though a wise man may easily answer, yet never convince
 their Judgements, for it hath ever been so since their dayes, and their
 Fore-fathers were as wise as they, and they cannot be satisfied, let it alone
 and wee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 it yeelds, and there is an end of their Improvement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:54116:57"/>And here I'll give you a President, which
 though it might as to the nature of it, have come in more seasonably in the
 discourse about common Field Land, yet here it is very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall also, both as
 to the end I bring it for, and for the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a Capacity of a vast
 Improvement, both upon it self, and upon all other Lands of that nature.</p>
                  <p>There are many hundred if not thousands of Acres of Lands near

 if you observe them above half the year ly full of water, if not under water,
 and I believe it is worth about five shillings an Acre, I am sure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of
 it is not worth three shillings, and some not worth two shillings an Acre,
 which if my Judgement fail not, may easily be drained, and laid so sound and
 whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, which were but that done as it should be, or but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the
 second Piece of Improvement, and the directions given in the seventh Chapter,
 treating of draining, I dare uphold one Acre would be as good as divers now are
 in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of it, but then should you also by the benefit of that Brook,
 and all these gallant rich Land floods that issue from the Hills on one hand,
 and from the Vale especially on the other hand, take the advantage and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
 of them also, and according to the first Piece Improve it by Floating, which
 may very Feazibly be done according to the direction of the fourth, fifth, and
 sixth Chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may be Improved to its utmost. I verily believe it
 would not onely make good the utmost extent of my Improvement promised, but
 will afford Hay sufficient to supply all those Barr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 come unto so great an Improvement paying the cost and charges, if the design
 had taken after they had seen it wrought unto their hands: but there are a
 thousand, and ten thousand Acres up and down the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, some yeelds more, and
 others less hopes of vast Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and all great enough if men would put
 them upon tryall, and great and vast quantities of Land in many Forrests,
 Common Fields, and other Heaths, Wasts, Moores, and other Commons, subject to
 the greatest Improvements at little charge, which will never be done till men
 know their own.</p>

 severall,<note place="margin">2 Advantage of this Enclosure.</note> it would so
 quicken and incline his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that he would be greedy in searching out all

 Marl, Muck, Soyl, Marl, Lime, Earth, Chalk, and Mud, &amp;c. With many other
 wayes, (all which men will infinitely more pursue when they know their own,
 than while it lyes at random; And a Monarch of one Acre will advance more

 will more naturally fall into the next Piece and there shall be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

 Tilled) may be gained, which raiseth Straw, Stover, and Fodder, abundantly for
 raising Soyl, Dung, or Manure: As old, and the onely infallible, and undeniable
 meanes to advance any Land whatsoever. I shall digress a little because all men

 surely were there either Soyl to be had at <hi>London</hi> for Mony, as indeed
 there is enough to be had without; nay in many parts men may have Mony to carry
 it away, else were there a River to Barge it up and down, men would Improve it

 Experiences, Take Mr. <hi>Tusser</hi> speaking in his Husbandry of the great
 Advantages betwixt Enclosure and the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion Countries, and betwixt

                  <p>Consider well many Solid demonstrations of truth in these

 husbandry or the best way of Improvements of Lands, but ever advised &amp;

 especially the good of your Posterity, indeavour &amp; prosecute such an
 Enclosure that is not nor can appear to be any particular soules hindrance. Tis
 true I have met with one or two small Pieces, as M. <hi>Spriggs,</hi> and
 another whose name I remember not, that write against depopulating Inclosure,
 with whom I freely joyn and approve, such as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer oppressive times by the
 will and power of some cruell Lord either through his greatness or purchased
 favour a Court, or in the Common Courts of <hi>England,</hi> by his purse &amp;
 power could do any thing, inclose, depopulate, destroy, ruine all Tillage, and
 convert all to pasture withont any other Improvement at all, lay Levell many
 honest families to the ground, dispeople a whole parish, and send many soules a
 gooding, a cursed horrible oppression, which for my part I would it were
 Fellony by the Law, which I think really is no better, which hath brought men
 to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that because men did depopulate by Enclosure, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is
 now impossible to enclose without Depopulation, but against Enclosure it self,
 meerly to convert it from a generall promiscuous Common age, to a division or
 di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of every ones share and Interest therin to his own particular
 possession, use, and occupation, to manage hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, <pb n="94" facs="tcp:54116:61"/> and
 Improve as he shall like best, both for manner, time and charge, I never yet
 did see or read any to avouch the same, but should be very willing to meet with
 such an Antagonist, for whom I am prepared, and will if God please to give
 opportunity in mild and loving way endeavour to convince him of his rash
 mistake: but should any man take offence at Enclosure as of it self, as I
 verily believe none doth, yet at such a way or Method of Enclosure as is here
 held forth and discovered, that provides as much for the raising and increase
 of Corn and all Grain, as for supply of Pasture and Meadow, and provides for
 all Interests their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Advantages, I hope very Doggs themselves
 will not move a Tongue.</p>
                  <p>And as for old writers, so for new and late ones they all with
 one consent encourage to Enclosure &amp; Improvements, some affirming that the
 great benefit of the Sheep their Wool that Staple Commodity of <hi>England</hi>
 doth Imploy more people by far on every Acre than by Corning,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Hartlip</hi> his legacy page 56.</note> which may

 great Advancement to no prejudice at all, &amp; is a member of one of the fix
 Pieces of greatest Advancement promised. Although the best sort of Land of all
 will yeeld the greatest profit, yet not without some seeming little Prejudice
 to it, and also this will best continue and hold his beauty, and strength, and
 Improve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Grazing rather than lose, which the worser sort will not. And of
 this best sort of Lands with the Improvement to be made thereon very
 Considerable, I shall also speak under the sixt and last Piece of all: And
 shall now set forth how the Plowing of all such Lands, according to the Design
 proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, which shall be a supply or filling up, and running over of the
 measure of plenty of Corn in case Inclosure should decrease it (which I am
 confident upon the consideration of the aforesaid Reasons thou canst not
 Imagine) and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that Extreme also. In which Projection I shall tell
 thee, that if thou wilt follow the Rules prescribed, thou shalt double the
 prizes of thy Lands for the present time of Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and after lay it down
 better for Grazing than thou too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest it to plow, onely consider that of this
 second sort, there be three natures.</p>

Gravelly.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The first natured Land advanceth it self most be Tillage, yet
 raiseth Corn in abundance also, but the two other lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter natured Lands
 advanceth not so much in it self,<note place="margin">The middle sort of Clay
strong Land advanceth it self by Tillage.</note> as in that wonderfull increase
 of Corn it yeeldeth to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth; I verily beleeve that Lands of these
 latter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are as fruitfull and kind for Corn (especially if they be
 resty) and for four yeares may produce as much increase to the Strike or Market
 as that Land that is as Rich again, or twice as Rich, for as to the Corning
 Land it may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly sometime be too good, as alwaies too bad, I had far
 ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make choice of a middle sound warm Land, than of the richest and
 fattest that is,<note place="margin">The warm lighter Land advanceth most in Corn

 Corn than the other, and yet this also may be bettered with wisdom used in the
 Plowing for Grazing also.</p>
                  <p>First therefore consider the nature of this first sort of
 Land, and the way of Husbandring it, to inable it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the promised
 Improvement; And so I begin with that which is of a pure Clay, or of a little
 mixed nature either with Sand or Gravell, and yet is of a cold temper, and so
 is neither so wholsome for Cattels lodging, nor so fruitfull for their
 Pasturing;<note place="margin">How to bank Ant-hills most speedily.</note> Which
 sort of Land is many times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with Ant-hills, which are best destroyed
 this way, being opened, the Soard taken up, and the Coar taken out, and
 scattered before the Plough, will make all the Land Plow the better and also
 lye better, and the Mould wil help a little all the parts of the Land they are
 spread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And Rushes and Moss in abundance, may many times so over-run the
 Land, which are so thick and noysome, that they not onely hinder the Earths
 naturall fruitfulness, but the Rushes are so thick and high in many Pastures,
 that the Sheep many times make them for their Refuge, to preserve themselves
 from the heat, that oft-times they are sheltered so long by them untill they be
 lost by the Manes,<note place="margin">The best way to destroy Rush or cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in any Pasture</note> Maggots, or Vermine; A great prejudice to the Grazier, or

 the Lands, which will no way more certainly and <pb n="99" facs="tcp:54116:63"/>
 Advantagiously be removed but by Plowing these Lands, which course although by
 many men it be thought an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverishing of the Land, yet I absolutely deny the
 same, and affirm both from mine own Experience, and the Practise of those that
 have made tryall thereof, that it shall most wonderfully advance the same for
 present, and future; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Plowing indeed weakens Land; Extremes on either hand
 are dangerous and destructive; Food and Bread su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staineth Nature, but Gluttony

 Drunkenness drownes it; And as over Tilling and forcing out the heart is worst,
 so I say, not then to Plow when the Land is run to moss, and to these
 corruptions, is no less bad: And being done with wisdom and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is far
 more advantag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 And this my self have offered familiarly for Lands of this nature, worth and
 quality, to give a Plowing or double Rent for the same according to his
 naturall worth for three or four yeares, but not above, as hath been conceived
 the Land hath been able to bear;<note place="margin">Advance for Plowing, and the

 may be possibly; For the time of Plowing the Lands may yeeld double Rent, some
 more, some Rent and half Rent, and some one third part more than old Rent; All
 which I conceive is a great Advantage, with another secret Advantage interwoven
 with it, as an Adddition to the State, which is the raising of a great quantity
 of Corn to the use of the Common-wealth, The setting of many Poor on work, The
 raising Straw, which wintering Cattell with, may raise such abundance of good

 most Lands, except it be upon that which is a harsh binding churlish nature,
 which wil also admit of a good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, though not so good, especially

 go not under the true and naturall Soyl of the Earth, neither plow it too

                  <p>And when you come to sowing your Lands, you must get very
 strong weighty Harrowes (if you would do it indeed, and not slubber it over as

 I also as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry Over-Plowing, or the Plowing of Lands as most do; some
 Plow as long as it will bear any corn, and others as long as it will bear good
 Corn; And others they Plow on any fashion, lay their Lands, as though they were
 over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running them, both to Corn and Graze, and when they lay it down, some lay
 down sound warm dry Land very high, ridge and furrow, and small Land too, very
 prejudiciall to their Land and themselves too, and are justly reproveable;
 others lay down strong cold Land flat, unopen'd, some part Plowed, some
 unplowed, full of balkes, holes and hils; as if they would secure or ingross
 all the coldness and Venom of all the water and hunger that is either naturally
 upon it,<note place="margin">Reasons why but three or four yeares are prescribed

 upon it, or passeth by it; they matter not after what manner they leave it, nor
 after what Grain; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prescribe onely three or four yeares to Plow
 unto this sort of Land, and to raise it every year, not less, because the Rush,
 Filth, and Earth will not be rotted, nor well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, nor the nature of
 the Land changed with fewer <pb n="105" facs="tcp:54116:66"/> Tilths, nor the Lands well
 brought to a good height, round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and driness in lesser time; for if it be
 cold Laud, all that can possibly be done will not lay it high and dry e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
 nor the Mould wrought to her perfect tenderness and true Mixture, whereby it
 may yeeld more fruitfulness; but if the Land be very rich of nature, and not
 well wrought, nor the Rush perfectly destroyed, nor the Lands brought up to a
 convenient height and roundness, then one year more may do well, which year
 shall yeeld the best crop outof all question, but will draw a little more from
 the strength of the Land,<note place="margin">Last Crop may yeeld most Corn, but
worst for the Land.</note> than any of the other yeares did; and if the Land be
 in strength, it may very little prejudice it, and therefore this I leave to
 every mans pleasure, upon this consideration, and could wish that all men would
 so Plow, as mainly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Advance and Betterment of their Land,
 especially Pasture Land, and no otherwise; For you were as good lose some of
 your inheritance (as you do) in my opinion, Or as good lose the Land which is
 but the Carcas, as the strength and vertue which is the Heart and Life of it,
 for therein is the Common Advantage, when the Earth yeelds most increase, or
 fruit, and a little parcell yeelds abundance of fruit.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and lastly, I advise to lay down all Lands of this
 nature upon Wheat,<note place="margin">To lay down Land upon the Wheat, or Rie
Stubble is best, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of it.</note> Mes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly thicken and improve the Soarding, and if my Principles fail not,
 will raise as good a Soard in the first year, as after any Summer Corn
 whatsoever will in two, and must do well for these Reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, because it hath one half year more to Soard in, then
 after the Lenton Tylth, and so is somewhat Soarded before Oates, Barley or
 Pease are sown.</p>
                  <p>Secondly because winter Corn groweth thin, long, and a
 stronger Straw, and gives more liberty to the grass to grow, and spread the
 thicker, and the Soard will also be very rich and fruitfull; I likewise advise
 to sow this Land, as early <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>as
 possibly you can, even as soon as your other Crop is ended, the sooner the
 better, unless the Condition of the Country very much oppose it, how ever the
 Earlier it is <pb n="106" facs="tcp:54116:67"/> sowed, the better is the Crop like to prove
 in my opinion; because these Graines of Wheat or Rie,<note place="margin">The way
of Sowing Land to be left after to Grass</note> &amp;c. require the land to be
 in better Tillage than this can be: Therefore help it what you can possibly, by
 seasonable and early sowing, that it may have as much Summer as may be, and by
 all means Harrow in your Corn after it is Plowed; For this is more certain to
 produce a good Crop, And secondly leaves the Ground even smooth to Graze; yet
 forget not that your Land be left High, and Round, the Colder in nature the
 Highe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and Rounder as aforesaid,
 &amp; each Furrow be Scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up as cleanly as you can possibly; These simple
 particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars really Observed, and Practised, will bring the Land to that
 condition that I shall make good what I formerly promised, and to this
 particular I shall say no more for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, onely this may be applied to any
 of this second sort of Land, be it of what Mixture, or Composition soever, that
 is Banky, Mossy, Cold and Rushy, and will have a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable effect
 promised; But if possibly you could run over a good part of this Land with Dung
 after you have plowed it,<note place="margin">Dung laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the new fresh Turf,
works won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> before you sow your last Crop, or so much as you could,
 it would produce a double advantage of the cost bestowed towards the Soarding
 of it. And if after you have Reaped your last Crop, you could then run it over
 again, with any quantity of Muck, or Compast, it might so nourish your Land,
 and that for many years after, possibly it might be near as good again upon the
 old Soarding, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for you would wonder how much good one Load of
 Manure doth upon the Land so Tender,<note place="margin">When one Load of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

 three Load will do on old Soard, or old Pasture so Rough and Filthy; nothing
 will make you to beleeve this, but your own experience. Let me prevail herein
 (good Reader) to make a tryall, it will be to thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, be not an Enemy to

 insuing Discourse, may hold out some Improvement to be made out of the same. As
 for your best Land of all, That by Husbandry, Drayning, Separating, cleering,
 Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Soyling or some sort of husbandry or other was brought to this
 perfection, it was not in this condition na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally nor originally from the
 beginning, much whereof may be now clear from Rushes, Mossiness, Sow Thistle,
 Nettles, Weeds, and Hemlocks and all other pelf, and onely bring forth pure
 Grass, both thick and rich; this possibly may admit of little Improvement upon
 it self, but unto the Owner and Common-wealth this may yeeld above double
 profit for some yeares by moderate Plowing, and afterward return so soon to his
 naturall fruitfulness, as that it shall yeeld his old Grazing Rent the first
 year, and so continue; But this Land being of all other the most subject to
 Abuse, <pb n="108" facs="tcp:54116:68"/> and greater prejudice than any other Land
 whatsoever; And I am confident unless the Presidented directions contained in
 the fourteenth and fifteenth Chapter, be most punctually observed, it may
 suffer loss, therefore I must provoke no man to take the pursuance of them
 here, unless any who is of such a publique spirit, as rather desires the
 Publique than his own private Advancement; And for some other men when they
 find so great profit come in upon them by this or any other means, they out of
 a thirsty desire of gain will Over-do, Over-plow, and so destroy their Land for
 it is not Plowing simply as aforesaid; that impoverisheth Land, but too oft
 Plowing, and look you where you will generally throughout this Nation, and you
 will find where any good Pasture is destroyed hereby,<note place="margin">Destruction of the best Land is by over-plowing.</note> they have
 Plowed Six, Seven, and some Nine, Ten, and some Twelve Crops together, which I
 approve so well, as I say it is a Losing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme; And I wish it were Felony so
 to abuse a mans Self; Lands, Posterity, and Common-Wealth; Also which Lands may
 be so many yeares before they come to a perfect Soard again, as may lose as
 much in abatement of Rent before it come up to the old Rent, as they got in the
 advance Rent by Plowing. And yet if I affirm, that Mowing Land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
 Limitaion, is as impoverishing unto it, as Plowing Land with Moderation,<note place="margin">Mowing Land a great Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verishing.</note> especially Upland
 Pasture, I should not much mistake; I am a greater E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emy to the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Limit than to the other with
 Moderaion, and yet tthe one is cryed down by all, and the other by few or none;
 Therefore my advise shall be, to Plow thy Land three, four, or five Crops, if
 thy affections stand that way, and lookest at greatest profit,<note place="margin">Moderate Plowing better than unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mowing.</note> Sowing it
 first with Hemp, Oad, Coal, or Rape-seed, Madder; Licorish, or Sow such rich
 Commodity that will so well pay for it, or something else that better agrees
 with the rankness of so gallant Land, which for divers of the first years will
 be so rank, that Corn will fall Flat, and Dwindle, or Rot, and neither be
 kindly in quality, nor rise to the strike in quantity, as it will upon those
 Lands after divers Crops taken, or upon leaner Land, and then after with Corn
 the last yeares; And if thou <pb n="109" facs="tcp:54116:68"/> wilt but lay it down round,
 &amp; even, upon the Wheat, Rye, or Meslin Stubble Sowed in his proper Season,
 observing some other few Directions, handled more at large in the aforesayd
 Chapters, thou shalt not need to fear thy Lands Impoverishing or abating Rent;
 It will produce so gallant and sweet a Turf, as will feed as well, and faster
 than it did before, if not better: For my own part, I do affirm, That had I the
 managing it whilst under Tillage, I would make good the same upon good
 Security; But as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, use your own liberty, he that Plows not such
 Land at all that yeelds its utmost strength and fruit in Grazing, which admits
 of no Corruption or Degeneration, doth wel: Because the Nation will afford
 other Land enough,<note place="margin">Plowing left indifferent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Richest
Lands.</note> that stands in more need of this Husbandry to supply the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
 Corn; And also because many men hold it a great Disparagement to Plow up such
 gallant Pasture; from whom I do very little or nothing dissent in Judgement,
 yet he that (if by Plowing) can Advance the Publique and himself also, I dare
 not say but he doth better, yet neither much amiss; Every man herein may please
 his own affection, where the Common-wealth is not eminently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced.</p>
                  <p>But for other wayes of Improvement of the Richest sort of
 Land, I know little more worth Divulging, for either the Cost and Charge
 expended will not produce an answerable present Advantage, or else the
 continuance and certainty of future hopes may prove doubtfull; Which
 uncertainties I affect not, onely take this remembrance with thee, that if thy
 Pasture be very Vast and Large,<note place="margin">Divisions of Land
advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.</note> Lesser Divisions will set the dearer and better, and every
 mans money for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, when greater are bargains for few men, and those
 for great ones also that will make their own Advantage, yet use moderation
 herein also, A large Pasture is comely, and a little Pingle Inconvenient,
 Extremes are neither for Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit nor Profit, but for Destruction;<note place="margin">Small Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reproved.</note> A Pasture about one hundred or
 sixscore Acres, or a hundred and fifty Acres is very commendable where they lye
 remote and at good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from great Market-Towns, or where Pasturing is
 ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <pb n="110" facs="tcp:54116:69"/> plentifull, but if either Pasture-Land be scarce,
 or border upon Common Fields, or Heaths, or Forrests, or if they lye near or
 adjoynining to any good Market, or great City, lesser divisions wil farre
 out-vy with greater in their price &amp; advantage, the people lying under such
 necessities of Pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, some to help to relieve their Common, and others to
 relieve the necessities of their own neighbouring Families; But in thy
 Divisions be sure to make them alwaies in the lowest parts of thy Lands, that
 so thy Ditches may serve in stead of Draines or Conveyances of Water, or taking
 away the Coldness that offends thy Land; every mans own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will
 patronize this Position.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, when any of these Rich Lands shall Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
 into Mossiness, Rushes, Coldness, or Over-grow with Weeds, Nettles, Hemlocks,
 Sow-Thistles, &amp;c, then thy Land wil need good Husbandry, and wil admit of
 Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for Hemlocks, Nettles, Docks, Chick-weeds, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common
 Weeds, these are as much occasioned with Fatness and too much Richness, as from
 any other cause; And when from this cause, no cure like Plowing, for that
 brings profit with the Cure,<note place="margin">Plowing the onely Cure of
VVeeds.</note> and advance in the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement; there is much Land of this
 Fatness; Some there is in divess parts of this Nation, as about Hay-Stacks, or
 Sheep-Pens, or places of Shade, or in the Warmest parts of many Pastures, which
 Sheep and Cattell chuse alway for their Lieare, and very much about the heads
 of Conney-Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; All which according to former Direction (in Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old
 Resty Land) will Reduce this to Moderation in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much Rankness; And
 especially if it be Plowed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what oftner than the other sorts of Lands, it
 will bear near as many more Crops without prejudice, and no other means
 whatsover will so Surely, Feacibly, and Profitably, work this Effect in my
 Experience, <hi>viz.</hi> To destroy the Weeds, and reduce it to perfect
 Grazing.</p>
                  <p>And as your Land degenerates to Mossiness,<note place="margin">Plowing the only Cure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Mossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Rush &amp;

 either Gravelly, Light, Warm, and Sandy, or else Mixed,<note place="margin">VVhat

 full as good as it was before Plowing; I have known a Winter Stubble after the

 usually was worth any Winter upon the old Soard, &amp; yet hath not bin

 as the said Lands have bin worth almost the whole year. The Eadish hath bin 
 <pb n="112" facs="tcp:54116:70"/> so fruitfull, and my self have had the like Profits and
 Advantages, and have had a Wheat Stubble of my own being the third Crop, that
 will make good what I have Affirmed, and the very first year of Grazing full as
 good, if not better, than it was upon the old Turf before Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>They that cannot manage this Objection further,<note place="margin">Object.</note> yet confess and say, 'tis true for two or three of
 the first years it may possibly hold fruitfull, but it shall fall after seven,
 eight, or ten, or more years, after that it shall be worse than ever.</p>
                  <p>To this I can say little more than what I have said before,
 unless you can produce me some Experiment,<note place="margin">Ans.</note>
 wherein my directions have been observed, and your Prejudice succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
 otherwise you say nothing; which Experiment when you have found, I shall not
 question but to discover your mistake, either you are mistaken in the nature of
 the Land, or else in the manner or way of Husbandry and Plowing, or else in the
 Method I propose in the laying of it down to Graze, or else the Stubble you lay
 it down upon, in all w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if you pursue me not, expect it not, all being
 faciable, and any man may more certainly, and as I conceive more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully,

 and thy Advantage sake; I know other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures which indeed were Plowed nine or

 condemn; yet this President answers this Objection, it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now upon the

                  <p>Another Objection may be raised,<note place="margin">Object.</note> which is this, your new Plowed Lands are more

 and laid down upon the Winter Corn Stubble, &amp;c. you either found little

                  <p>And if to this thou wouldest but add the sowing of Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,

 gallantly would this good Land nourish them? what a benefit might the fruit of
 these Trees yeeld either in Perry or Sider, to be transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into other parts,

 fecible and might be done with great profit to all, and prejudice to none. I am
 ashamed to speak so much in these so easie and wel-known wayes of Husbandry,
 but that there is so much neglect thereof, as if men minded more their own and
 Publique Confusion, and Ruin, than Profit and Advancement; Some will cast Banks
 and Ditches for separation, and plant no Quick at all in them, and so destroy
 as much ground as if they Quick-set it, and spoyl the ground to no advantage;
 and others will Quick-set and never Fence it, Weed, nor Mould it, and so it
 either perisheth at first,<note place="margin">Not preserving Quick-sets when

 barren, not worth any thing; or else suffer it to be bitten, or eaten with

 but a little Patience, and Addition of a little more cost and paines, there
 would not be one foot of ground more lost, but a double or treble Advantage
 raised upon it in few yeares, and ever after, with no other Husbandry
 continued, but ever bring in double profit for the charge bestowed, As in the
 cutting, plashing, scouring of the Hedges, which payes his cost bestowed, and
 sometimes double and treble, and if it be a Hedge curiously preserved, and cut

 use, the Rush as fruitfull, and the Land as cold as formerly in comparison.
 Therefore I shall advise far less Trenching, and yet produce more soundness; I
 say then, as I have often said, seek out the lowest part of thy Land, and there
 make either a large Trench or good Ditch, or be it but the old one well scoured
 up (if there be one) to such a Depth as may carry away that water or Corruption
 that feeds the Rush, or Flag, from every other upper Trench thou shalt see
 cause to make, and so ascend to any part of thy Land where these offences are,
 carrying with thee one Master Trench to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all thy less Draines, along
 with thee, and there make a Drain (yea all thy Draines and Trenches) so deep
 (for I prescribe no certain depth) as to that Cold spewing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that lyeth at

                  <p>It is impossible without going to the bottome to do any good;
 Our own experience shews it, and so the depth may be two Spades gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 must go, and then one Trench shall do as much good as twenty, alwaies curiously
 observing that thy Trenches <pb n="118" facs="tcp:54116:73"/> run in the lowest part of thy
 Ground, and through the Coldest and most quealiest parts of thy Lands, and for
 the manner of making the same, and further Direction therin, I shall refer thee
 back unto the second Piece, the seventh Chapter, where I have spoken something
 to most of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Passages.</p>

 remediless, for this insuing direction will not fail, and will bring profit
 with it to pay for curing also, which is a moderate Plowing, Ridging all thy
 Balks, raising and Landing all thy Flats, gaining them as high as possibly thou
 canst, Plow all, and leave none, and do this three yeares together, and observe

 demonstration by Opinion when experience may so easily resolve the question.
 For Curing of them, I shall onely direct the old Piece of banking them, but in
 a more unusuall way, and somwhat more speedily than formerly;<note place="margin">How to bank Ant Hills most speedily.</note> yet make a banking
 Iron or Spade, made very thin or smooth on purpose, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more compass or

 worketh smooth &amp; clean will further this doubly, and then begin with the
 crown or top of thy Hills, and so divide thy over Turf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to five or six parts,
 and take down the coat or over turf to <pb n="121" facs="tcp:54116:74"/> the very bottom of
 it, the Turf being cut as thinne as possibly thou canst, so thou be sure to go
 under the Roots of the Grass, else it will not Soard so thick nor speedily, and
 so turn it down round about the Coar, which taken out, and cast about thy Land
 so deep, that when thy Turf is turned down,<note place="margin">Why to lay them
lower than the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Earth.</note> even just as thou tookest it up,
 even so lay it down every Turf in its place, that the whole compass of the Hill
 may be rather lower than the Surface of the Ground, and but a very little
 neither, yet lower it must be, because else the Ant will return more readily
 again: And secondly, because then it will receive more naturally the Water, or
 Moysture, which will occasion a more speedy Soarding, and prevent the Pismires
 return, for the Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture will not be endured by the old Inhabitants; And this
 done in the proper season, which is in the end of <hi>November, December,
 Ianuary,</hi> and beginning of <hi>February,</hi> which seasons if thou fail as
 good neglect them wholly; for thy Earth will neither have benefit of the Frost
 to mould it, whereby it will be spread with ease, and have some of the Winters
 rain to settle it into the Ground, nor the Turf have fitting time to sodder and
 work together before the dry weather comes to parch it; and loosen it again,
 and so maist lose a great part of that Summers profit which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise thou
 maist receive; And if thy Land be clean and and free from Moss, Rush, and other
 pelf, this will be a sufficient cure as to reducing the Hilliness to Plainess,
 and thy Land to an exceeding good Improvement; and so here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have no more to
 say, unless thy Land be over-run with the aforesaid filth; but what is the
 Burden of my Song, and is the onely and sure Cure of most of the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that
 occasioneth Barrenness, which is prescribed as a soveraign Remedy
 (<hi>viz.</hi>) Plowing according to former directions destroyes them all,
 &amp; brings meat in the mouth with it, takes away the Fins, and the Mous-ear,
 the wild Time; and Shar-grass, if used with Moderation, and so I have done with
 this.</p>
                  <p>As for the Sow-Thistle,<note place="margin">Sow-thistle a great

 certain symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of good Land, as usually they are; so are Nettles, Hemlocks,
 Mallowe, &amp;c.) and yet I had rather they were all destroyed than remain upon
 my Lands (but because they are of less offence, aud we have greater Prejudices
 than these, I'll let them pass) but for the Sow-thistle, it is of so great
 offence that it destroyes all the Grass it covers, which is many times a foot
 round, and also so easie to be destroyed, that I shall put the Grazier or
 Farmer upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charge or trouble,<note place="margin">Easiest way to
destroy the Sow-thistle</note> but onely take a little Paddle-staff, as a
 walking-staff, and give each one a chop at the Root as he passeth by them,
 which will be rather a Recreation to an active man than a burthen, and thus
 every day a few as they grow in bigness, will in few dayes destroy them all; Or
 else a Shepherd, or Keeper of the ground, as he walks among his Cattell may
 easily keep them under, as he goes about his daily business; But since I have
 found out a more certain way which will destroy them at once spudding up, which
 being done as soon as the Thistle begins to spread, but they must be done as it
 were up, by, or under the Root, which lyeth very overly, and if it be not cut
 at first chop, it may at next by the Root: I had the last year a Field of an
 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Acres so thick over-runne, that some Acres were as thick that one man
 could not do above half an Acre in a day, I caused them to be spudded up by the
 Root, which was done at two chops with my Spade, I was not only freed of them
 the last Summer wholly, but my whole ground is cleansed of them for this year,
 and so I hope for ever. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the charge thereof was near twenty
 shillings, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. A more certain way I know not.</p>
                  <p>For Goose Tansey or Hoar Tansey like Weed,<note place="margin">Goose Tansey</note> I must needs make Proclamation, That he that

 no more but this, Never Plow your Land too long, nor out of heart or strength
 by no means, for this occasioneth it to grow more thick and fruitfully; 
 <pb n="123" facs="tcp:54116:75"/> and also load your Land hard with Cattell in the Spring,
 and when it doth grow high and strong, Mow it down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of Midsummer
 Moon, or in the dryest and hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test time of the Summer, but the earlier the
 better, and other means I can prescribe none other, but in all your Plowings

 it wil be thought to be Prejudice by many to destroy it, especially upon
 Commons where they reserve it for Fuell <pb n="124" facs="tcp:54116:76"/> on purpose, and
 is a very great help to poor for Firing; yet whether in those very places it be
 so good as an Acre of Grass I question, but there are other parts where it is
 little worth, &amp; some places not worth getting, yet it is the ruin and
 destruction of all the Grass it groweth over, for whose sakes I have spoke thus

 Goss-Ling-Heath, or any thing else whatsoever occasioneth Unfruitfulness, and
 work an Improvement above what is Expected. This way of destroying Broom, Goss,
 Brak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <pb n="126" facs="tcp:54116:77"/> or any such filth, would be of great esteem,
 had it been held out of it self under specious pretences of rare discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as
 some can do, but I am confident it is an unfailing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and will certainly
 destroy the pelf as it inriches the Lands, and though many devices may be found
 out, or strong conceits raised to do the same, yet at present I know none so
 certain nor so profitable.</p>
                  <p>There is another opportunity of Improving almost any sort of
 Sound Land, of which I gave a touch in the last Chapter, Treating of the way of
 Improving the best sort of Lands, of which it is most capable,</p>
                  <p>That is,<note place="margin">Planting Fruit-trees in hedges is
good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</note> by Planting all sorts of Fruit-Trees in all your
 Divisions, and Hedg-rowes, where they shall not Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice one foot of Land,
 and where they may grow as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously as in an Orchard, if you will but
 wisely manage them.</p>
                  <p>The Cost or Charge of this Improvement is as easie as any that
 can be made, if you will cast it into a Method:</p>
                  <p>That is, when you make any Partition in your Lands, which I
 know you will not without a Quick-set Hedge, in which in every twenty yards you
 may Plant a Crab-Tree stock as well as a Thorn, onely in setting of it be
 carefull of Moulding it plentifully with the best Mould you can get,<note place="margin">Chief
piece in Planting all fruits.</note> For that is the main Piece in Planting as
 I conceiee: To lay a good Foundation in every thing, prepares for a good
 Superstruction; So that if the Root be Nourished from the Earth, the Root will
 feed both Bough and Branch more plentifully: Therefore though thy Land be
 naturally Barren, yet make that place all round about thy Stock a good compass,
 as good as thou canst, with good mellow Mould,<note place="margin">Best Earth
discovered.</note> and that which smelleth well in Digging is Fruitfull,
 containing the juyce of Vegetables already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
                  <p>The Tender Mellow Earth is between the two Extremes of Clay
 and Sand, and must needs be best: And thus having Planted thy Stock in good
 Earth, thy work is half done, if thou do but now and then renew the same, that
 is, almost at it were, take up thy Tree again, or else get well under 
 <pb n="127" facs="tcp:54116:77"/> the Roots, and so apply fresh Mould to them while they
 are Young and Tender: And this will cause it to Thrive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out measure, and
 put forth a gallant Smooth Bark, which it ever a Sign of a Thriving Tree: So
 that be but a little carefull in the choosing thy Graft; both for it self and
 the Fruit of it, and then after Grafting have but patience in preserving of it
 a few years, and here is all the Cost Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>The Improvement may be wonderfull, if men would but Plant
 their Grounds as in many Countries they do; as in <hi>Worcestershire,
 Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Glostershire,</hi> and great part of the Country of
 <hi>Kent,</hi> they use<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Every Hedge-row is full of Fruit, and some men
 plant, whole Fields over, every thirty yards asunder, whereby they reap a
 Couple of Harvests,<note place="margin">How to reap two Harvests.</note> One of
 Grass or Hay, and another of Fruits.</p>
                  <p>O that I might but be a Remembrancer to this poor Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of
 the many opportunities of Honour, Wealth, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is Capable of, and
 that I could but perswade its Natives to take hold thereof, and deliver the
 Earth of those advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages it is so big withall: Judge the rest by this One
 Poor Piece; Were all men but industrious herein, how might the very fruit that
 might be raised in this Nation almost relieve it in such a year of Scarcity as
 this is like to be? If it would not be bread to the Poor, as it might be in
 some measure, I am sure it would be Drink, and how much Barley would that
 preserve to Bread-Corn that is now turned to Mault? Yea, had this very year
 been but kindly, and a Plentifull Fruit-year, what a great help would it have
 been to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland?</hi> And might not <hi>England,</hi> had it been but
 generally as Ingenuous as some Members of it are, we might have had twice as
 much Fruit as now we have.</p>
                  <p>But certainly we are afraid lest Plenty should be our Ruin, or
 else all men that Study so much to get Estates at second hand, Each from other,
 would rather strive to gain it at first hand Out of the Earth, the True mother,
 in whose Bowells is more Wealth than ever will be drawn forth, and enough to
 satisfie (whether theirs is or no I know not) I am sure all Ingenuous men
 desire it, that so they may be as <pb n="128" facs="tcp:54116:78"/> the Midwife to deliver
 the Earth of it Throws, it will send forth enough, if thou wilt but lay an Egge
 in the Sand of the Earth, 'twill bring it forth: Help the Birth, be the
 Man-Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife (who is never in use but in greatest need) Need and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery is
 likely to be greater than is expected; Yea, I fear than hath been of many
 yeares; If God work not above man, And man work not now with God, by all
 Prudentiall means whatsoever. And so much, and no more be said of Planting
 Fruit-trees at present, untill I have gained more Time therefore, and
 Experience therein.</p>
                  <p>And now I resolve to speak no more of any more wayes of
 Improvement here; but onely One word of Preserving that We have already, and
 'tis but onely to Direct a word or two how to keep Corn from Blasting, and Seed
 from Vermine.</p>
                  <p>For Blasting is one of a Kingdomes Curses,<note place="margin">An unfailing way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Corn from Blasting.</note> And
 therfore to Prescribe naturall, absolute, unfailing Remedies in all Places and
 at all Times, is beyond my skill, yet one Unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Remedy there is, also the
 Removall of this, so it is the Removall of all Causes or Occasions of
 Barrenness what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, And that is sinne, the Root that brings forth all: First
 brought forth the Curse, and ever since the fruit thereof: The onely Cure
 thereof is our Lord Jesus set upon the Pole, he must damn the Curse for us, and
 in us, and we by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to him, and our Application of himself to us,
 Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over him, and humbling our Soules before him; Hereby must we be made
 Sensible of the Removall hereof, by which, and by no other meanes it is
 Removable.</p>
                  <p>But the naturall Helps as usually are Applied, are the Soaking
 or Steeping Corn in thick fat water, or Lime-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Urine or Brine, and the
 Mixing-Lime or Ashes with the Corn while Wet and Moyst, that so it may receive
 part of Smithon-Meal, finest of the Ashes or Lime upon it self, and Cloath it
 self with it, so as it may fall cloathed all over to the Earth, and so be
 covered therewith: This hath been Highly Commended of late as a great
 Preservation of the Purity of the Corn,<note place="margin">The most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
naturall help.</note> and in some-parts of the Chiltern Country, now put into
 great use, so that instead of their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall <pb n="129" facs="tcp:54116:78"/> way of
 changing their seed, which hath been an Old received Principle of great
 advantage,<note place="margin">A good help to preserve Corn pure.</note>(and I
 verily believe is very good Husbandry) now they betake themselves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: Yet
 however, I would not Dehort but perswade m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n to the other also; Especially those that use to fetch
 their Seed out of Chiltern into other Parts or Countries of the Fiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, who
 have found great Advantage by their Constant Change of Seed.</p>
                  <p>And this is a very good meanes for the preserving of the Corn
 from Fowl,<note place="margin">To preserve Corn from Fowls and Vermine.</note> or
 Vermine also, which Usually devour one part thereof before it can be covered,
 the Lime or Ashes sticking to the Corn, offends them so, that they will avoyd
 it, and though I say it inricheth not the Corn, or Land, no more than what that
 Substance of Lime or Ashes is, that cleaves unto it; Yet so much it doth, and
 is help, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Help to the bettering of it; Yet not such a Help as
 some men cry it up to be, as if it were as good as a Manuring, or Soyling,
 which usually men bestow upon their Land for Wheat; So as I would have no man
 Under-value the least Opportunity of Advantage any way; So I would not have any
 man deceive his Land, or himself, for herein conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Poor and
 Common-Weale are beguiled also.</p>
                  <p>There is one Poor Simple Piece of my own Experience I dare not
 but Communicate, for the Preserving Early, or Late Sowed Corn, or for
 preserving it when it begins to Corn in the Ear, from Crowes, Rookes, or Jack
 Dawes, and this was yet never failable to me since I found it: 'Tis no
 more,<note place="margin">An unfailing Prevention of Crows Rooks, or Daws from
Corn.</note> but Kill a Crow or two with thy Gun if thou canst possibly upon
 the place, where this Vermine haunteth, is not, Kill one any where else, or if
 thou canst not get a Crow do but take any black Feathers of Crow, Raven,
 Turkey, Pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, or any other Fowl, but let them be as black as possibly they
 can: And them take into thy Field where they Annoy thee, and in the most
 Obvious, Plain, and Perspicuous pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, make a great hole of two foot over,
 and about twenty Inches deep, which Hole must be stuck round about the Edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
 with the longest feathers, and some of the shortest laid in 
 <pb n="130" facs="tcp:54116:79"/> the Bottom of the Hole, with some part of the Carkas if
 thou have a Crow, and that Turf that you dig out of the Hole, or else that
 Earth being laid round upon a heap, you may stick round with Feathers also; The
 Feathers of one Crow will dress two or three of these Holes, and about half a
 dozen or eight of these Holes, will serve for a Field of ten or twelve Acres;
 Which being done, and made on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Ground, observe the Creatures,
 whether they will fall in that Field or no, all the while those Feathers remain
 fresh, which may be will be a month, unless great store of Rain, or Weather
 beat them much, and then they must be Rennewed once again, if thou seest need:
 And if they Annoy that place, or once fall thereabouts, I am much Deceived; I
 know they will not, you shall see as soon as ever you have made but one Hole,
 and they take notice of it, how great offence they take, if One Crow but
 discover it, there is work enough for him to call his Fellows to behold the
 Wonder, he'll ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the Crows thereabouts to behold the same, which they
 will View with such admiration,<note place="margin">The Reason of the Crows
offence taken.</note> as will make you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Creatures astonishment. The
 Reason is, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, no more but an Affrightment, or Astonishment, by a
 New and unexpected Object, or else from that Antipathie they bear, or some
 misgiving, or fear of being Intrapped themselves, that possesseth them, that
 they dare not come near the same; Neither Gun-powder which many use to dress a
 Crow withall, nor constant Shooting of them, or Killing of them, shall not have
 the like effect; It cleares all the Field of every one to thy hearts
 desire.</p>
                  <p>I promised to give a more Full Description of the
 Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-Wheel, or Water-Wheel to raise Water out the Stream that Drives
 it.</p>
                  <p>And for the more Clear understanding of the Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
 it, Imagine thou stoodest just before the Face of the Wheel, as it is Plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 Water Drives it; but this is of a very Plain Wheel, and as I conceive a better
 and more Exact one may be Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>1. The height of the Wheel may be betwixt fifteen foot 
 <pb n="131" facs="tcp:54116:79"/> to thirty foot, or more if thou pleasest, according to
 the strength of thy Water,<note place="margin">The fuller Description of the
Persian VVheel.</note> &amp; the height thou desirest to raise it, made just
 like an ordinary Under-shoot Mill-Wheel.</p>
                  <p>2. The breadth of the Sole or Ring of the Wheel may be also
 according to thy pleasure, from fifteen Inches to thirty Inches broad, Ladleled
 as other Water-Wheeles are.</p>
                  <p>3. The Buckets or Kans to take up thy Water, if thy Wheel be
 about fifteen foot high, may be Six in number, or Eight if thou please.</p>
                  <p>4. The Buckets to such a Wheel, just so long as the Wheel is
 broad: The Bucket is made with four boards nayled to a bottom-board: Two sides
 run upon a strait Line, which are those planted to the Ring of the wheel, and
 to the Ladle-board, and the other two run towards an Angle-taper, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
 from twelve Inches in the But or bottom, to six Inches at the mouth one way;
 and from eight at the bottome to four Inches at the mouth the other way; the
 mouth is open alway.</p>
                  <p>5. The Buckets fill themselves in the bottom as the Wheel
 goes, and so lose some of the Water in comming up, &amp; when they come almost
 to the Top, a Trough about three or four foot long it Planted, as it were in
 the Ring of the Wheel near the Spoakes of it, and takes the rest of the Water
 as it delivers it out at the Top, which may be about half the Buckets first
 take up, out of which Cistern thou mayst ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Pumps or Trenches lead thy
 Water, for Watering a House or Land as thou pleasest, up to that Levell; It
 matters not how slow thy Wheel goes, nor for any greater fall or height of Dam
 than will drive thy Wheel, which may be about two foot; It is of very speciall
 use; So hast thou as Plain a Description as I can give thee, untill thou have
 the Figure or Form Delineated, which will give more light to the Discovery of
 it, which shall among other Tooles be Deciphered, with a further Addition of

                  <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> so are all Extremes
 whatsoever, that is, to Plow it after Liming so long as is either any spirit
 left in the Lime, or heart in the Land, or it will bear any sort of Corn or
 Grain, it will ruin it for Posterity; But if that after Liming, men would but
 study Moderation in their Tillage, anid not (because the Land yeelds such
 abundance of Corn) Plow or Till it so long as it will carry Corn, no nor so
 long as it will carry good Corn; But if men would after good Liming, take
 three, four, or five Crops, and then lay down their Lands to Graze, it would
 not be the least preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; or if upon the laying of it down, men would but
 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently Manure it, or else upon the last Crop you intend to Sow, Dung it
 well before Sowing, and lay it down upon the Rye, or Wheat Stubble, it would
 produce a sweet Turf, and I am confident prove excellent Pasture, as good again
 as it was before; but if after it is layd down you would Manure it once again,
 a little Manure now will produce more fruit than as much more upon the old
 Soard, it would be warrished for ever; Many men have had ten Crops of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
 Corn after one substantiall Liming,<note place="margin">Presidents for

 eight pence an Acre, some Land worth a little more, but more Land less worth,
 and some upon Land not worth above one or two shillings an Acre, have got many
 gallant Crops upon a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as aforesaid; some men have had and received so
 much profit upon their Lands upon once Liming, as hath payd the purchase of
 their Lands: I my self had great Advance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, yet I lived twenty miles
 from Lime, and fetched it so far by Wagon to lay upon my Lands, and so not
 capable to make like Advantage as other Borderers.<note place="margin">The Land
most naturall for Lime.</note> The Land naturall and suitable for Lime, is your
 light and sandy Land, and mixed sound Earth, so also is your Gravell, but not
 so good, and your wet and cold Gravell is the worst, except your cold hungry
 Clay, which is worst of all, but all mixed Lands whatever are very good.</p>
                  <p>As for your Lime it is not of a hot burning nature as most 
 <pb n="135" facs="tcp:54116:81"/> men conceive, and do strongly believe, and many have
 wrote;<note place="margin">The nature of Lime quite contrary to the common
opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> 'tis true it is of a wasting, burning, and consuming nature,
 before or in the slacking or melting of it; and may be possibly in the meal or
 spirit of it; but in the use of it, and working it into and with the Land and
 Earth, and in the production of the fruit, it seems &amp; appeares to be
 Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and most sadning of Land of any Soyl whatsoever, and that for these
 Reasons.</p>
                  <p>1. Because of it self it is a heavy and weighty substance, and
 sinkes deep, and loseth it self sooner than any Soyl whatsoever; if you be not
 very carefull in the keeping of it up, and rasing of it, you will lose it
 before you are aware of it or can suspect it.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it so alters your lightest Ry Land, that though it
 be naturally Sandy and Gravelly, that it never before would bear any thing but
 Ry or Oates, yet by one good Liming it will be reduced to bear as good Lammas
 or Red straw Wheat, with Barley and Pease, as your strong clay Land.</p>
                  <p>3. Were it of so hot a nature, then it would have the best
 operation upon your coldest &amp; wettest spewing Land, upon which it hath
 none, and all Experience shews the contrary.</p>
                  <p>As I remember,<note place="margin">How much wil Lime an

 Acre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may also over-Lime it, as well as under-Lime it; Also a mixture
 of Lime, Manure, and Soyl together, is very excellent, especially for a few
 Crops, and so lay down to Graze I conceive is best; but by any means Till not
 long, for I say it is possible the Land may yeeld Corn being so exceedingly in
 Tillage, and so well wrought, as long almost as any Earth is left in it. I have
 seen many parts Tilled so long as there hath been little lest but small Stones,
 Flints and Pebles; A <hi>mad Cmstome,</hi> fly from it, your Lime will sink
 downwards exceedingly, use all means possible to keep it as much aloft as you
 can, else you lose it, and the benefit of it, and remember it, whatever you
 forget, and then you may plow and work your Land, as you do with any other
 Soyl.</p>

 like Lead, without any Composition of Sand or Gravel; &amp; some others of it

 Gray are very Excellent, and so also is the Red no less; And whereas

 that the Smith casts forth of his fire, as the corruption of his Iron, Fire,

 converted it to Tillage, little or nothing was made of it; And to Graze it was

 than I Mudded the other; And one Land I neither Mucked, Mudded, Foulded, or
 Marled, nor laid any cost upon it at all, yet Plowed them all alike, &amp;
 brought them into good Tillage, and Sowed them as I remember with Wheat,<note place="margin">One no cost at all.</note> and Rye mixed; &amp; for the first
 year, I reaped very good Corn upon my Cart-mucked Land, and Fold-Mucked the
 best of all, the best upon my Mudded Land the next, and upon my Marled Land
 reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good, not so good as the aforesaid sorts yeelded (because Marl
 yeelds not forth his utmost strength the first year) And upon that I laid
 nothing, I reaped nothing, not so much as Straw, although I gave it the same
 seed, and the same Tillage as the aforesaid Lands. Whereby you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
 the goodness of the Land, which is bad enough indeed when it will bear no Corn
 at all, for very little Land in <hi>England</hi> that is old and Resty, and in

                  <p>The next year I Sowed Barley upon all sorts of these
 Lands,<note place="margin">A double Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</note> and upon my Marled Land

 with Oates, and reaped no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing again that year also; Then afterward I Marled
 that which before I had Mucked, and that which had not Soyl laid upon it, &amp;
 brought forth nothing the two years before, which brought forth as gallant Corn

 Peremptory, and although many men are of opinion that it can have little

 Plowing of it up and Raising of it, as high as thy Land will bear it, &amp;
 then a good Drain or master Furrow, if it will serve; if not, a deeper Drayning
 Trench will, for Wet, and too much Cold, and Moysture offends all Corn and

 cast up on Hils &amp; Shelves in many Meadows and other places in them is Fruit
 and Vertue, and I question not but the Application of them, either to Corn or

                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:54116:85"/>For in all Soyles and sorts of Earth
 there is a Combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Incombustible Nature, each Wrestling with other,

 be swallowed up again in one.</p>
                  <p>But there is another sort of Sand, and this is the richest of
 all, and that is your Sand upon the Sea Costs, and in the Creeks thereof,<note place="margin">Pest Sand of all.</note> which is very rich, yet in some parts it

 in many, and most parts of the Nation the use of it is neglected, &amp; I dare
 not have so uncharitable an opinion of my Nation, that they would neglect so
 great and facile an Advantage; In <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> upon those Coasts it is
 very rich, and upon the Coasts of <hi>Cornwall</hi> also, and upon all the

 there is in most Sea Sands, and is as likely also to be in this, unless or

 opinion of it, but that it is of excellent fruitfulness, and so all
 <hi>Wales</hi>-ward borders, so rich, as that they carry it many miles on
 Horse-back unto their Lands, and make such vast Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, as to raising
 Corn and Grass also, as is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous: Now, were it on the Northern, Eastern,
 or We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Coasts, as rich as it is upon the Southern Coast, as it may be for
 any contrary experience I have had, I could not believe the people to be so
 Dronish as they are in some parts thereof, but that they would Drain out that
 Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to their Lands, as would cost but little or nothing but their
 Labour; However, I must absolutely say, there must needs be great heart and
 fruitfulness in these Sands also, because the Richness of the Sands is from the
 fat or filth the Sea doth gather in by all Land-floods and Streames that bring
 it from the Lands,<note place="margin">What causeth so much rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Sea

 the Fish and other creatures, and thousands of other matters that putrifie in
 the Sea, all which the waters Casts to Shore, and purgeth forth of it self, and
 leaves in the Sands thereof, while it self is clear and pure.</p>
                  <p>And now being discoursing thereof, give me leave to let you
 know the vertue and excellency the Sea may yeeld,<note place="margin">The Seas

 Inriching of the Land, as from Fish of any sort, which is so fruitfull for the

 with us, it yeelding more Advantage for Food to the relief of mans nature than
 unto the Earth; I'll say no more, unless any Capacity fall in the dead of

 they feed better, and Eatter, and with less meat, than when they are abroad
 with all their Grass they spoil; Which I did more than three quarters believe,

 forty, fifty, some sixty, some eighty Load, and some more of Excellent Manure

 Cow-dung, and Horse-Dung, such old ordinary Soyl; I intend to say little; in
 regard the Common use thereof, which hath extracted the vertue and excellency
 to the Common-wealths great advantage, onely thus much I shall say by way of
 advise and reproof from my own Experience.</p>
                  <p>1. By way of advic Prize them according to their worth: The
 Sheeps <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ung is best, and a little
 hereof is of more <pb n="149" facs="tcp:54116:88"/> strength and heart than the others are,
 but whether it arise from the rich, and pure nature of the Dung, or from the
 warmth of the Sheeps bodies, I know not, but I conceive from both, because it
 warmes the Land &amp; makes it comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; And therfore in regard of the
 worth and excellency of Sheeps dung, and in regard of the great want of soyl,
 i'll dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course a little more at large of a very good way to raise ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
 great quantities of soyl,<note place="margin">How with great ease to raise rich
dung.</note> and that very good and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, by the help of one good flock
 of Sheep, and that in the winter too, when soulding is more neglected and of
 le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>er use: though I proposed it in
 the first Edition, yet because I set not forth the way of raising it, I fear
 occasions the neglect of it. It is but to make a good large Seep-house for the
 hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of thy Sheep in Winter, the comfort it will be unto thy Sheep, will be
 double worth thy house charge, which may be Sheep-cribbed round about and in
 the middle too, to fother them in the nights, herein once a week, or twice
 according as thou desirest the quantity of muck to rise, or according to the
 goodness of it thou expectest, bring in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Loades of Sands either out of
 the streets or wayes, or from a sand-pit or mine once or twiee a week, and lay
 it three or four inches thick, this renew every week or more and let them sit
 on it two or three or four nights or more, and keep this with renewing as oft
 as thou pleasest, and what with their heat and warmth of their bodies and the
 fatness of their dung and urine, they will so corrupt or putrify the Sand, that
 it will turn to excellent rich soyl, and go very far upon thy Land, and be far
 more serviceable than thou canst conceive; This of great use in
 <hi>Flanders</hi> and other parts of the World. And for your Horse Dung that is
 held to be too hot,<note place="margin">Horse Dungs Excellency.</note> but I
 never sensibly discern any inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therein, especially where it is
 feared, let it be but well Wroxed or Rotten, and I conceive it is one of the
 best com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post of Land, and I am sure, if it be Soyl of Horses, or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
 where is much Corn given, it is more hearty and rich by far, than that where
 Horses live of Hay onely; And for Cow-Dung tis as wel known by all, both in
 nature and use, that I'll save further trouble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:54116:89"/>2. But by way of reproof of one Piece of
 Husbandry in the applying these three sorts of Dung to Land, I say, Men are
 mistaken in that they indeavour not all possible Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in laying their
 Dung upon their Land, when once they begin,<note place="margin">A great mistake
in letting soyl be uncovered.</note> and in spreading of it as soon as laid on,
 and Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it into the Land as soon as spread, for if my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fail
 not, they lose a great part of the Fruit, Sap, and Vertue therof, that carry it
 forth into their Land about <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer,</hi> or in that heat of Summer, and
 spread it all over their Land, and so let it lye open to the Air and drying
 Winds, and parching Sun, and Showres, which comming hastily help to wash it off
 their Land, and thus lyeth for a month or six weeks before they Plough it into
 their Lands, all over the Field or County, and many places more, which besides
 the Raynes washing away, consider but the Winds drying, and the Sun and
 Pearching, and Scorching of it, &amp; Exhaling, and Drawing away the Spirit of
 it, &amp; then tell me the Excellency of this Husbandry; to me it seems not
 ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, Ile submit to better Judgements, they that are of a contrary
 opinion, I desire them to shew me Reason, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me better; And til I know
 better I desire to be excused.</p>
                  <p>And for their Sheeps Dung, as soon as ever one Land is
 foulded, let the Soyl be covered immediately, let the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or weather be
 what it will: Also in the Manuring your Green-Soard or Grass Land, do little in
 the Summer, but either in the latter end of it, after <hi>September,</hi> or
 else all Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long is the proper season, when it may have rain to beat it
 into the ground, or Frost to wrot it and dissolve it; And though sudden showers
 will wash some away,<note place="margin">How to lose none of the least benefit in

 otherwise would carry away; And this course some Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Husbands hold in
 all their Lands, What Rain or Land-floods fall in their overgrounds,<note place="margin">Some

 they carry into the next below that, and float there, then what falls in that,
 with the rest of that which is a floating there they carry into the 
 <pb n="151" facs="tcp:54116:89"/> next, &amp; so into the lowest, &amp; so will not lose so
 much as the advantage of a common Ditch that carries the least Land-flood with
 it, but this falls in occasionally here, &amp; therfore no more hereof.</p>

 one of my main designs, a Piece so little practised, which before I have fully
 ended, you will wonder it should have been so much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected being so

                  <p>Therefore when thou hast designed a Piece or Plot of ground
 thereto, which should be dry, sound, and pretty hearty, thou needest not much
 matter what nature of Land it be; so that thou canst but get two Spade-graft,
 or one and an half of good Earth, before thou either come to the strong Clay or
 Land, yea though it have some Gravell, or Stones, be it but well mixed with
 good Earth; it may do well, yea best of all, because of hollowness and
 lightness of it, though it should be very boggy Land, yet if it have any
 richness <pb n="155" facs="tcp:54116:91"/> of nature or heart in it, thou shalt find a
 marveilous suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness therein, to make a very good Improvement this way, yet
 the most natural Land hereto in the Experiences I have made or seen, is your

 to raise Wood for thy use, &amp; increase, and the Countries service, it
 matters not into what form thou cast it into; how ever seeing the first is as

 being planted about a Mannor House; or dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place, for warmth in Winter,

                  <p>Therefore having cast thy Land into any of the plots
 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid except the Circular, which I conceive of least suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of all
 to this work, then suppose it be ten, twenty, or thirty Acres, I suppose less,
 if thou cast it into a Square or Triangle, or Ovall way, then having found the
 midle of it, thou mayst if thou please, cast out a Circular round Plot or
 Ovall, containing either a ninth part, or a seaventeenth part, or but a fifth
 part; and that Incompass in with a little Ditch, well quieksetted with thorn,
 and here and there an Ash, Oak, Elm, or Witchazell, reserving a Grass-plot to
 walk round about, of fifteen or eighteen Foot wide, and <pb n="156" facs="tcp:54116:92"/>
 then equally divide the rest into so many parts as thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest severall

 them, containing fifteen or eighteen Foot wideness, which will serve as a
 Cart-way, or Passage, to fetch out thy Wood at every fall, as well as for walks
 for thy recreation, because in this manner of Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou canst not Cart

 so divied all by Ditches which make thy Divisions, thou may if thou pleasest to
 cast thy Banks outward,<note place="margin">Planting Strawberyes, is
excellent</note> and set thy Hedge inward, Plant the Banks with Strawberies,
 which will delight themselves herein, &amp; grow fruitfully, either on the Sun
 or shady sides. Now when thou hast plotted out thy ground, prepare for
 Planting, and first inquire, and search about the Country for Set-gatherers,
 such as will bring them every two days fresh, for the fresh ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering &amp;
 sudden setting of them in their places, is of more Advantage to the furtherance
 of the growth, than thou Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginest.</p>
                  <p>Secondly prepare such Servants here as will not deceive
 thee;<note place="margin">How to get thy se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 Rough, and Brushy, all being unproveable sets, receive them not, but give them
 such wages as they may afford to get such as are fruitfull and proveable, and
 if possible get them from off as hard Land, as thou Plantest them upon, however
 be sure they be thriving smooth Rooted, or smooth Barked sets, of what sort
 soever they be, &amp; as straight as possibly thou canst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the severall sorts of Wood quickest in rising and
 growing,<note place="margin">The quickest growing wood.</note> generally are your
 soft Woods; as Poplar, Willows, Asp, Sicamores, Maples, Witchazell, &amp;c.
 your Ash is a gallant thriving Wood also, and indeed for quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and profit
 too, it is the best in my opinion, some good Oak set will do very well, and Elm
 also towards your outsides; but if thou resolvest to be a Planter to purpose,
 then thou must be a sower of all Seeds of the severall Woods aforesaid, or
 setter of many Sciens, and a Breeder up of Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 <pb n="157" facs="tcp:54116:92"/> fashion, Sets would prove very scarce, which now for

 in most part of the Nation may be had for two shillings, or two shillings six
 pence a thousand, some more some less according to the goodness and bigness of
 them, and dearness of the Country for workmens wages, &amp; indeed the lesser
 the sets the more certain of growing, but the bigger they are,<note place="margin">What Sets are best.</note> the fatter, and sooner they rise to
 their growth, only some of them may fail.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, having prepared thy Sets, then set to Planting of
 them, which I advise after this manner. All thy Borders made, or but cast out,
 thy Sets must be all Planted in the same way as thou wouldst Plant,<note place="margin">How to plant thy Sets.</note> or as usually men do Plant a Thorn
 hedge: First cast up by a Line a little Ditch about two foot and half, or three
 Foot broad, just so deep and but a little deeper than thou canst take up good
 mould, and so as all Labourers begin their turning Turfdo thou, and then lay up
 a little mould,<note place="margin">How to make thy Dike to Plant thy Sets
in.</note> and there lay thy first Row of Sets, some say three Sets in each
 Foot, but I conceive if thy Sets be good two may do very well, then cover
 them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, raise another Border about nine Inches above that,
 thy Mould or Bank layed well ashore, or sloaping, and there plant another Row:
 and cover them well also, as men do their second Row of Quick-sets.</p>
                  <p>Therdly,<note place="margin">How to plant thy Quick, and mould
them also.</note> cast up another Dike against that like a double Dike, so as
 both may meet together upon the Top, and lye close together, and then plant two
 Rows more of Quick as was directed on the other side, and if thou hast any
 quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of space, betwixt thy two upper Rows of Quick, thou maist plant one
 Row upon the Top, or two, if thou seest cause, if thou hast room to spare; And
 so thou must go on throughout thy whole Plantation, a Dike and a Land or Bank,
 and again another Dike and a Land, and so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. And be sure however thou
 do, to plant all thy Sets in the over-most best Mould or Earth, that thy Sets
 may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther root in stiffe-binding Clay: nor hungry Sand, and fear not, leave
 no Land undigged or unwrought, nor plant none in Green-soard by no meanes.

                  </p>
                  <p>This way of Planting will certainly be so thick,<note place="margin">Object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> that they cannot prosper one by another, or
 else it is Impossible the Earth should yeeld Fruit, Heart, or Sap, to so thick

                  <p>Your Spring-woods, in some parts of them grow as thick,<note place="margin">Ans. 1.</note> especially where your old Roots grow so thick, as
 you can scarce set one foot betwixt them, and every Root may send forth twenty
 or forty Spineyes, and yet all nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished from the Earth, &amp; these Stools
 they grow upon also.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer that Experience hath also made it good as

 Planted a foot or more asunder, and yet came not near this, nor is neither half
 so much in quantity; Nor yet the other thinner Plantation, although little or
 never the whit the bigger, or taller than this, which is so thick Planted, nor
 never worth so much by the Acre of many more years growth, as this at the
 Eleventh year.</p>
                  <p>And for the effecting of this Design, thou must take in two or
 three more particulars, one is a strict Observation of the Season in Planting;
 And then secondly your Demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure towards it after Planted.</p>
                  <p>First, The Seasons are as soon as the Leafe is faln, the

 <hi>November,</hi> and so thou mayst continue three <pb n="160" facs="tcp:54116:95"/>

                     </gap>t the next if possibly, or next after; And shouldst thou be
 occasioned by any hindrance, to keep thy sets longer Unset, be thou sure thou
 get their Roots into the ground, well covered with good Mould until<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thou canst set them, and be not drawn
 away to the contrary by any Workmans perswasion whatsoever, for though the
 lying out of Mould of Unset, do not kill them, yet will it so backen them that
 thou mayst lose a full half years growth in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thy Ground thus planted, thou must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in
 the Weeding of it,<note place="margin">Weeding most necessary.</note> for I know
 no greater cause of this so great Advance than this; The keeping of the Ground
 clean from Weeds, and as mellow and open as possibly, which will cause the
 Roots to shoot exceedingly, and the Plant to grow abundantly, thou must for the
 first &amp; second year prize it, and dress it almost as a Garden; And
 there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be sure thou preserve it from any Beast, Horse, or Sheep biting it,
 in the least measure; should Cattell break in they would destroy one yeares
 growth in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>As for Boggy Land, much of it that is perfectly Drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to
 the bottom,<note place="margin">Boggy-Land will bring forth a Plantation of
Wood.</note> that is little worth will nourish a Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Wood to good
 Advantage, especially your Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and Willow, and Alder, your Ash will grow
 well also; But therein you must observe to make your Dikes and Draines so deep
 that you may lay it compleatly dry, you must goe under all your Bog, to the
 cold spewing-Spring &amp; near a foot below that, &amp; then what you plant
 upon the Bogs or Lands you may expect a wonderfull issue: 'Tis very common in
 four or five years that the Willow rises to gallant Hurdle-wood, &amp; in five
 or six yeares, to Abundance of Fire-wood, and small Pole for Hops, and other
 Uses. One Acre of new Planted Willow upon some Land not <pb n="161" facs="tcp:54116:95"/>
 worth two shillings an Acre, may in Seven years be worth near about five pound,
 in some parts an Acre; and in some parts of this Nation more. And I verily
 beleeve were all the Bog-Lands in <hi>England</hi> thus planted, and Husbandred
 well, after these Directions, might raise Woood enough to maintain a great part
 of this Nation in Firing; and for other sorts of Wood, the well Ordering &amp;
 Nourishing it, although in Lands so bad, would produce a wonderfull profit far
 more than I will speak of.</p>
                  <p>And I suppose,<note place="margin">What one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of Willow
Planted on Boggy Lands may be worth.</note> he is no ill Husband that can raise
 a bog to a double advance, considering some of them are worse than nothing; But
 when they are so exceeding Coarse and barren you cannot expect such
 Fruitfulness ordvance; as from that Land that is of a fatter or better nature;
 For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all plants and Woods will do much better, on better Land than on
 coarser; and in case thou shouldst bestow Soyl or Manure on thy Land before
 thou Plant it, it would be both Labour and Cost exceeding well bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and
 conduce much to the nourishing of a young Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

 or Coppices,<note place="margin">How to thick Woods that grow too thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Which fully observed, may doubly improve the same, &amp; such a way
 is here projected as is little used in any Woods where I ever yet came, and as
 unlikely also to any thing I have yet spoken unto, which is no more but this,
 at every Fall where thy Wood groweth thin, take a goood straight Pole or
 sampler growing of Ash or Willow, at the usuall growth of the Wood, and Plash
 it down to the Ground, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four or five Inches above the top of the Ground;
 not cutting it wholly off, and cut off the head of it, and put the over end of
 the Pole after the head cut off, a little into the Ground, which thou mayst do,
 by bending it in the midst like a Bow and so thrust it in, and so fasten it
 down, once or twice from the middle of it, and upwards, close to the Ground
 with a Hook or two, and out thence where any branch would put forth standing,
 will put forth lying, and more and more grow up to Plants and Poles, as the
 o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="162" facs="tcp:54116:96"/> Spring doth, and so you may, though it be
 uncapable of Sets, or Planting with the Root, lay over all your Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant places,
 and thicken your Woods where ever they are wanting.</p>
                  <p>And let me beg of thee thy credence here, it is most
 cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,<note place="margin">A president of a wood thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> I speak out
 of my own Experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, one of the gallantest Woods I know in <hi>England,</hi>
 it is constantly used at every fall in some place or other of it; the Wood is
 eighteen fals, every fall eighteen years growth; their very Faggots made at
 length of the Wood (besides all their Pole-woods) all their brush being
 faggoted into the Faggot, were this year sold for one pound three shillings
 four pence a hundred, &amp; forty Faggots make a Load; it is worth about twenty
 five pounds an Acre every fall Study warmth all that possibly thou canst, for
 any Plants are helped much in mounting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft thereby; therfore as I conceive
 they prosper worse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your cold Clay, which nourisheth the Tree little, and
 hath no quickness nor life to quicken the growth therof; but by toughness and
 coldness of the Earth the Sap is shut in, and cannot get in to spread so
 frankly as it should, and so instead of thriving of the Tree, the moss
 prospereth more fruitfully than the Tree.</p>
                  <p>Your Elm Plants may be gotten of young sprouts grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth
 of the Roots of the old Elm, many thousands,<note place="margin">Elm
plants.</note> which being slipped and set, will grow very fruitfully.</p>
                  <p>Your Sicamore is a very quick growing and thriving Wood,<note place="margin">Sicamore plants.</note> especially if it be planted upon some
 warm, sound, and rich Land, they will thrive wonderfully, and rise to gallane
 shade, excellent to make Walks &amp; Shaddow-bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, useful for in ward
 building, where better is wanting, &amp; for firing where wood grows
 scarce.</p>
                  <p>As for Sets of this nature, if you go to any place where
 Sicamors grow, and there in the beginning of the Spring you shall sind the
 Seeds chitted up and down as thick as possible; which gather up, and set them
 presently, and you shall have your increase at large, being planted curiously
 from any the least prejudice of biting, breaking, or shaking the said Trees
 after planting; according to the first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>

                  <p>And if the <hi>Romans</hi> ordained that Consuls should have
 the Charge of Woods, that Timber might not be wanting for Shipping, and
 Buildings, and publick Works, I hope our States will judge it a <hi>unum
 necessarium</hi> among us. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> at this day appoints an Officer for
 the Woods, who sees to planting yearly, as well as cutting down; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
 we may be left more naked &amp; convicted of our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in this grand
 neglect of so great a publique &amp; perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good as is the advance of
 Timber, I shall herby inform you, that there is scarce the worst Land we have,
 but will bear as good Oak as the best Land in <hi>England.</hi> I have read, it
 was a generall Custome amongst the <hi>Ancients</hi> that when they found any
 so barren Earth as would not graze, they presently plowed it, and sowed it with
 Acorns, Ashkeyes, &amp;c. and all other sorts of Wood-seed. We should grow
 wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than our Fathers, and we may easily outstrip their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences; but
 herin of all things else are we beneath them, they the planters, we the
 destroyers.</p>
                  <p>I shall therefore pray we may set upon this so good a 
 <pb n="164" facs="tcp:54116:97"/> Work, every man do a little. I shall therefore affirm,
 that we can scarce tell how to imploy one acre of ground to more and greater
 advantage than to the sowing of it with Wood-seeds a bed,<note place="margin">Land as well imployed by planting wood, as any way.</note> or two
 in a Garden of each would be a sufficient Nursery to plant many acres; some to
 be drawn forth one year, some another as the Plants grow in bigness, so they
 will require to be drawn forth to give the other more room; I dare say that
 should every Gentleman of a good Estate, but maintain one or two acres as
 Nurseries of all sorts of Wood, he might be furnished to plant every year a
 thousand Trees, and so as he drew his plants, repair his nurcery again, and
 need not have one hedg-row un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted with good Wood and Timber.</p>
                  <p>And for further inconragement herin, I shall further say, that
 Trees well planted, and carefully preserved, will grow to good perfection in
 one age, especially if the ground be open and loose, and not too binding. Many
 men in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> have set a Tree, and lived to see it come to such a
 growth, as hath been worth above twenty shillings, near thirty; but I have been
 credibly informed by a gallant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Knight, who reported of his
 knowledge, that a Gentleman in the Low-Countries, or <hi>Germany,</hi> planted
 one hundred ashes,<note place="margin">A president of 50. years growth of
Ash.</note> and at the end of fifty years resolved to sell them, and did, the
 price for which he sold them was five hundred pound; and he that can improve so
 much Land better, I shall desire earnestly to be his Scholler. The same Knight
 also affirmed that he knew another Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant there, that planted so much wood
 in his own Life, that he would not take <hi>50000l.</hi> for. Then how much
 Wood may be planted in this Nation, &amp; the Lands not less worth than now
 they are. I know some Lands not worth above 6s or 8s. an Acre, that hath
 yeelded in wood above 50s. an Acre <hi>per annum:</hi> And if this Government
 should compel all men to plant five times as much as they destroy, they compel
 them to their own great advantage &amp; honor, witness my aforesaid English
 Northamptonshire President. Now to those common &amp; most usefulll Woods among
 us a word or two, &amp; first of the Oak, that non-decaying timber</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:54116:97"/>It is somewhat slow of growing, by reason
 of the weight substantialness,<note place="margin">Oak plants.</note> and worth
 therof, yet will in the way of ingenious husbandry quit his cost &amp; charge
 bestowed; you may either plant it from the Set, or Acorn; from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn I
 advise because then you may chuse your seed from a likely thriving Tree, which
 sowed in a Nursery, or on Beds of purpose, no disparagement to your Gardens, or
 Orchard Nurceries, to have a Nurcery of all sorts of Woods planted among them.
 I know a gallant Gentleman in <hi>Kent,</hi> most ingenious for publique
 improvements, as wel in waies of Husbandry, as publique services, who
 main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a constant Nurcery of all sorts of Wood-plants from the Kernel,
 among his Nurcery of Orchard Fruits, and is so stocked with all sorts of Sets,
 not onely to supply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but may furnish a great part of the Country also
 it is Colonel <hi>Blunt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A president for Nurseries of
Wood.</note> living within a mile of <hi>Greenwich,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honourable
 in his name, but in the effects and fruits of all his actions.</p>
                  <p>I conceive it is indifferent, when you sow or set your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn,
 your ground prepared and in good tillage; but why not at or in
 <hi>October,</hi> as soon as they be ripe, or in the Spring early; but be sure
 the Acorn be full ripe, and the best time to remove them, or transplant, may be
 in the end of <hi>Nove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> or <hi>December,</hi> into your fields where
 you do intend they shall grow, being planted a good depth in as good double
 field mold; which done, you must be as carefull of biting, shaking, or breaking
 of them as you are of the Nurcery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they be so rootened and stifned so
 strong that they will endure a beast rubbing upon them, which had need be
 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove seven years; and if you intend them for Timber, cut not off the heads by
 no means, but chuse strait and smooth thriving barqued Sets as you can, and
 support them from shaking with the wind for two or three years at least, until
 they be most firmly rooted, so will they run up strait and tall, and prove
 gallant large Timber;<note place="margin">How to plant for Timber.</note> and in
 the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them, be very carefull of bruising them also, for if you
 bruise the top or head of any part, better cut it off; but if you intend them
 for lop or shade, or for bearing <pb n="166" facs="tcp:54116:98"/> mast, then cut off the
 heads of them, they will spread the better, inlarge their boughs and branches
 further, and yet make good Timber too, &amp; very good, though not so long, yet
 may possibly be as profitable as the other. The Oak agreeth well with any
 Lands, good or bad, Clay, Gravell, Sand or mixed Land, warm or cold, dry or
 moist, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the naturall growth of it in all Countries; but for
 artificial planting, I should advise to a middle mixed Land,<note place="margin">Open loose land the best for any wood.</note> yea though it be but
 barren, it thrives excellently upon as barren Lands as any are in
 <hi>England;</hi> the coldest, stiffest Clay is worst for all sorts of Woods,
 your open loose Lands is best for any Woods, or Fruits, and the Oak takes not
 pleasure in your richest soils of all but I question not the wel prospering of
 it there two, &amp; may be the cause why so little of it is found upon your
 richest Lands, may be, because the Land may, or is put to a more profitable
 use; for this I must needs acknowledge, that in many parts where Land is rich
 and dear, or lyeth near great Towns, and letteth at great prizes, the wood
 being in danger of stifling and spoiling by Wood-stealers, the Land may turn to
 greater profit; yet however, where Land is good, I should advise to some wood,
 though planted here &amp; there a tree in hedg-rows, &amp; where they may not
 prejudice the grass, or shade the ground, it wil be not onely an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
 in good measure of the Land, by adding to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com the fruit thereof, as well
 as of the grass, but an honor &amp; delight unto your self and Posterity. The
 Oak-mast ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth fat fast flesh, and long lasting Bacon, and will feed Deer,
 Sheep and Poultry exceeding well and profitably. I have read of one Oak in
 <hi>Westphalia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An Oak above 40 yards in Timber. Another
ten yards thicknes.</note> from the foot to the nearest bough, one hundred
 &amp; thirty foot, and twelve foot thick, and of another ten yards thick, which
 may possibly be; but I am sure profit and honour sufficient will attend an
 ingenious plantation of any sorts of Wood.</p>
                  <p>This is most renowned for Shipping, or any the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and
 most enduring works or buildings, or for the most curious Wainscot, or indeed
 for any use whatever. I shall be brief in all the rest, because that much that
 I have said in <pb n="167" facs="tcp:54116:98"/> the planting of this may be applied to the
 rest; the Barque is of as great worth, as of need and use.</p>
                  <p>The Beech is also a mast-tree,<note place="margin">Beech wood
the use and fruit.</note> and very usefull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, both in the Body,
 Branches and fruit thereof. The Body is very good Timber for the Joyners use,
 and for the Husbandman for Axol-trees, and for much Building, and the bough for
 Firing, and the Fruit for feeding Hogs and Deer, and I know not whether for
 Poultry or Sheep, but it makes meat sweet and delicate light of digestion, but
 not so long lasting as Peas or Acorns. It delights most in your warm Land, it
 growes well upon gravelly Land, and Lands very stony; and in the Chiltern
 Countries, and sandy ground, and balks not the barrennest Land, likes well, and
 better the hill and mountains than the plain; The Barque thereof is usefull for
 the floats of fishing-nets, and pantofels for Winter, and if you spoyl them of
 their Barque, they die. This wood grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth somewhat quicker than the Oak, and
 is more inclined to some Countries than to others, especially your wood-land
 parts.</p>
                  <p>The Elm groweth easily;<note place="margin">The Elm
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> it is all heart if it be fallen in his season, which is when
 the sap is fully and clearly down in the root betwixt <hi>November</hi> and
 <hi>February;</hi> it takes great delight in ditch-banks, and dry places; they
 will grow thickest of any wood whatever, and prosper, and as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the
 most advantagious planting them is in hedg-rows, or in little Plumbs of
 themselves. As for the Elm-seed, I can say but little, because I never made
 experience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, onely it is affirmed that there is a male and a female of
 the Elm, and that the male Elm beareth seeed, and not the female; which if it
 do, then the seed when it is ripe may be sowed as other seeds are upon a bed by
 themselves: and fine mould sifted and cast upon them; and if they be dry, they
 as other seeds must be watered, and so sowed in little rows, that a little
 trench be betwixt row and row, that they may not root one into and upon
 another, but so as that they may be taken up again with more ease, to remove
 and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant where you please.</p>
                  <p>You may get Sets of the very roots which sprout forth of 
 <pb n="168" facs="tcp:54116:99"/> it, and set them, and they wil grow; and very many
 affirm, that any Elm, or a very chip: when the sap is firm &amp; proud, will
 grow unto a Set.</p>
                  <p>But this I had from a Gentleman of credit as a speedy &amp;
 unfailing to raise Elm-sets or Plants;<note place="margin">How to raise
Elm-plants.</note> W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is, dig round about a well-grown Elm a foot or more
 from the body, unto many, or most of the Master-roots, and cleanse away all the
 earth, and then cut the root almost quite through with an ax, and so serve most
 of the roots, and if you cut some full through, you may, and forth of both
 those ends of the root you cut or divide in sunder, will come forth gallant
 sprouts, or plants, which you must take off with a little part of the root, or
 a little chip thereof, and plant it, and it will assuredly grow to a good
 Tree.</p>
                  <p>The use and worth of the Elm is little inferiour to the
 former; it is of absolute and singular use, especially for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-works; good
 for building, where it may ly constantly dry,<note place="margin">The use of the
Elm.</note> or constantly wet, but sometimes dry, and sometimes wet, it will
 not long endure: It makes excellent plank, and good board, the best wood in
 <hi>England</hi> for Wheelwrights Nathes or Hubs for wheels, and good for felly
 timber also.</p>
                  <p>In your second plantation, or removall, set them in very good
 order, and be carefull of preserving them as a garden from shaking with wind or
 cattel, or from biting or rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing by all means.</p>
                  <p>Some write, that in your second removall you may do best to
 tie some knots of some of the string, or twist them like a garland, and then
 set them and tread the mold down about the roots first annointed with Bullocks
 dung; but my self having made thereof no experience, cannot press it; all I say
 is, a small matter wil make out the experierce, which I encourage to. The Elm
 groweth to great worth, hinders little ground, delights in sound warm Land,
 dry, sandy, gravelly, or mixed Lands, but it must have good store of mold by
 all means; it doth not delight in cold moist clays, nor spewing weeping Land.
 One Acrs length with 1. or 2. rows of Elms upon a ditch bank at their full
 growth may be worth 20. or 30l. it runneth up generally to the greatest 
 <pb n="169" facs="tcp:54116:99"/> height and length of any Wood in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ash is also a gallaut quick-thriving Wood,<note place="margin">The descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ash.</note> but it takes not so much
 pleasure in a hard, barren mountainous Land as the Oak or Beech do. It will
 grow in good Land, and in Land of any nature or temperature almost, whats ever;
 it will thrive reasonable well upon a Boggy ground, so the same be deep
 Trenched to the bottom, and laid dry and sound. It delights it self in dry
 sound Land, and will grow very fast if it like the Land; faster than any of the
 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forsaid Woods; witness the Dutch Precedent I brought before, speaking of the
 excellent and great advantage Wood might yeeld in my discourse about the Oak,
 which I here forebear.</p>
                  <p>The use of the Ash is most manifold; good for Building,<note place="margin">The use of the Ash.</note> and for any work where it may lie dry;
 most prime for Coopers Hoops, &amp; Rimms for Sives, and Wheels, as Oak is
 also; and excellent for the Wheelwright, Ploughwright, and the Husbanman; far
 tougher than any of the woods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid and very rich and profitable, and the
 best Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, fittest for Ladies Chambers, will burn exceeding well and
 sweet, though green; but all this excellency unless for firing is quirkly
 spoyled, If you fall it forth of season, it will be worst of any Wood bare the
 mistaking of the season;<note place="margin">Season for the Ash its
selling.</note> the Worm will take it speedily, &amp; make it the most
 unserviceable of any wood whatever. The onely season is from <hi>November</hi>
 untill the end of <hi>Ianuary;</hi> for if the sap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin never so little to
 arise, forbear falling Ash. It spreads his root very large, and so is most
 offensive to your Corn land; because it both draws away the hert from the land,
 and offends the plough by his roots.</p>
                  <p>You may sow the Ash Keyes, which are the onely seed, in beds
 by themselves, and they will grow amain; two or three good beds will store a
 Country; draw then as they biggon; and at last draw all away, or else they will
 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy your Nurcery: plant them in <hi>Ianuary</hi> or <hi>December,</hi>
 mould them very well and carefully preserve them; cut not off the the top if
 you would have it to grow in length; it being a pithy wood, it wil somwhat
 endanger it; but it <pb n="170" facs="tcp:54116:100"/> may prosper well, though cut a
 little off the top, &amp; spread bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and be very usefull both for Timber,
 Lop, and firing: I have heard of a poor woman that had two or three ash-trees
 in her Garden hedge, and a strong wind came and blew the Ash Keyes all over the
 Garden,<note place="margin">A president of Ash his growth and advantage.</note>
 that at the Spring, her Garden was turned from that to a hopefull plantation of
 Ashes as green as a leek above the ground, the woman was at a great debat, to
 loose her Garden she was loth, and to destroy so hopefull a crop she was
 unwilling: at last she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to let them grow, and now her garden is turned
 into a nurcery, and she is turned a planter, and hath ever since maintained it
 to that use, and made many times more profit than she did before.</p>
                  <p>The slips from the roots are not so good sets as the sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
 or sprout from the Key,<note place="margin">The best sets &amp;c.</note> that is

 Their removing must be in the depth of winter,<note place="margin">The best time

 boughs, but no more of this.</p>

 common mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner uses, as to make Oxe yoakes, and somewhat usefull for the

 nothing else: <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastrus</hi> writes of it, that it will grow in

                  <p>The willow though <hi>Homer</hi> calls it an unfruitfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
 Tree,<note place="margin">The Willow.</note> yet I shall ingage much in the
 praise of it; it is the quickest of all wood for growing, and riseth more in
 one year than many doe in three: And for profit, I must questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether any
 can or may come neer it; it comes off with less charge than any, and hath a
 prehemency in lightness and toughness, and is very serviceable for spades and
 Gun stocks, and manifold uses more, to be kept dry it will scarce ever decry;
 It delights in low ground wet and shady, yea the most watery the more suitable,
 and yet will grow upon a dry bank, and in the Champion also: It is very good
 for firing also. It is to be planted of young sets cut off of any bough, about
 two foot and a half long, or somewhat shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, set or thrust into the soft
 earth or soft ground, almost any bog, being cast up in great lands, and on each
 side there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a Trench so deep as to go a little below the bottom of the bog,
 and these set a foot and a half a sunder in strait lines or else two foot
 asunder; the sets being thrust into the earth within eight or nine inches of
 the top; and this to be done in <hi>February</hi> and beginning of
 <hi>March,</hi> and in three or four years it will come, if it prosper as it
 should, to make win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings or hurdle wood, in a year or two more to make
 hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles, and great sets to bee planted at seven or eight foot length, to be
 set for Trees about eight or nine foot distance by river sides or little
 brooks, or more, if you would not have your ground shaded, which must bee
 secured by stakes or thorn, or some other means for two years, from rubbing or
 shaking with wind or cattell; it is conceived, that those planted moyst thrive
 fastest, but those upon a dry land indureth the longest: bee sure to cut your
 sets a little <pb n="172" facs="tcp:54116:101"/> aslope at the heather end, and set the
 biggest end down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and close the earth pretty close to it when it is set,
 and cut off all twiggs that come out of any part of the set. They may be cut as

 information; Therfore I have acquainted thee where thou mayst discover Truth in
 all: And if I have taken any thing up by bare information, it may fail in some
 circumstances, but I hope and do in good measure know it doth not, nor shall
 not fail, in the substance thereof; and if I shall here but make good or
 clearly hold out a double Improvement, it will be worth acceptance, (to me it

 Wayes, Rules, dnd Means for their accomplishments: &amp; that also at so

            <head>THE SECOND PART OF Englands Improvement.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow I shall proceed to the Second part of my Discourse according
to my promse, and shall therein endeavour the most clear and can did
discoveries of six more Peeces of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most
advantagious for the Improvement of Land of all sorts, and under all capacities
have yet ever been discovered, some whereof, and very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I yet never read
one word of, nor so far as I can find out, or hear, have yet ever been
published, unless you please to take that for a Discovery which is by a
Subintelligitur, as I conceive Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> that superlative Improver
(and <pb n="175" facs="tcp:54116:102"/> some such others) to whom can they make good but
one quarter of what they affirm, they neither can want Money, Clothes, nor
Scholars, I know some of the succeeding par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are the deep mysteries he
will impart for composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; how he came by many of them too, but that
they are many of them of his own experience, or to that advance he speaks of, I
affirm the contrary; and much fear the news he tels us too good to be true.</p>
            <p>The man I know, and have conversed with him, and have known him
some late years, and while his Books were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and conveyed into Noble, and
Gentlemens hands, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by himself, and his own Agents, I could bear
it, and suffer wiser than my self to be fooled, because I was not wise enough
as to beware of him, but now they come to be sold in the Stationer shops, and
spread abroad the Country to deceive, and beguile the Nation, I cannot
forbear.</p>
            <p>He tels us his discoveries are
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>methodically distributed, and so
they are, just as if you should put a man to his choic, whether if a man would
give another as willingly two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds as one, and would give him the
two hundred pounds first too, whether he would chuse the one hundred pounds. So
after he hath first told us of a certainty to raise two thousond pounds <hi>per
annum,</hi> with less than two hundred pounds stock, which I wonder who will
refuse, and close with another of his offers, which is, with five hundred
pounds stock, to raise a thousand pounds <hi>per annum?</hi> which of the two
is more probable, yet less desireable than the former, but both of them to be
effected with money. Yet me-thinks I could hearken to his fourth particular,
which is to discover a way without charge, whereby an industrious man, of a
reasonable capacity and fortune, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or dishonour, may contrive
to himself five hundred pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> Himself exceedingly wants
such a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, or else wants the reasonable capacity he speaks of; for sure
the fortune he speaks of he cannot want, being a man of so vast a mind, large
understanding, and great experienee, unless his experiences have eaten away the
rest, which to me <pb n="176" facs="tcp:54116:103"/> seems unprobable unless they be to be
found visible. These things are gallant in contemplation, but more sadly
experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, which you will hardly find by sea or land, nor any other place
but in Mr. <hi>Speeds</hi> chamber, I beleeve.</p>
            <p>He tels us by his fourth <hi>Item,</hi> that with less than fifty
pounds stock visible a man may advance a thousand pounds <hi>per annum;</hi>
but I fear either the invisible must be ten thousand pounds, or else his
thousand pound will drop short by nine hundred and eighty; and if you grant him
credence, or that there were a possibility in him ever to affect it, why should
any man so much abuse himself as to make use of his following <hi>Item,</hi>
which is two hundred pounds stock in three yeares to raise four hundred pounds,
and in three more double the four hundred pounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The which he
affirms but in probability, and yet the other upon certainty; but that of
probability may be, and is most evidently experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, &amp; was by may
thousands before Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> was born; but why any man should lay out
two hundred pounds, when with fifty pounds he may raise a hundred and sixty
times as much therewith. I wonder far greater than those he holds forth in
points of Husbandry as to advance land two hundred fold, from five shillings to
fifty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> &amp;c. and many more,<note place="margin">His
  book is but to draw thee to his chamber to tel thy fortune there.</note> in all
which I shall say no more, but refer thee to his Book and his personall
Discoveries; for I must and will lay him down the Gantlet: For there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to advance ths Common-wealth, if not to choak it; for many times when men are
brought extreme low, either by sickness or penury, and restored, as this
Common-wealth is, suddenly to plenty, or a good stomach, surfe it and undoe
themselves suddenlier with plenty, than by a sparer dyet, or a more moderate
condition; and so I fear may this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they embrace so high discoveries
too hastily; yet embrace them I pray, but with sobriety: and remember him also
that ran mad upon the beholding of his great Treasure; for such variety of
<hi>Extraordinaries</hi> may make men wild, and run from one to another, not
knowing where to close or stay, and the gazing after these Princely Incomes, if
they look after it till effected, may make them <pb n="177" facs="tcp:54116:103"/> look
their eyes out also; but enough hereof.</p>
            <p>Yet let me lament the sad condition of our Times, and I fear the
neglect of our Government too; for to very many members thereof, if not to all,
he hath given his Bookes, whose fault with humble submission it is, that so
great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries should still be clouded, and yet not put in practice, and
the Common-wealth thus bleeding, while either by a Patent, or rather, and that
I am sure for the value of one or two dayes pay at most of a common Clerk in
some Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would effect it; for truly the man is very conscionable, and
desires not a full condition, but chuseth a very mean one, and wil accept of
too little in all conscience for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries.</p>
            <p>I know to whom hee made many of them, and would have done all the
rest for less than twenty shillings, if the mans patience would have received
them, but most like he not being able to bear them neglected the embracing of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>And whether I have, and shall speak forth any of the things he
mean, I will not be peremptory, but beleeve I haue, and shall most of them if
opportunity last, but shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endeavour to hold them forth in that
Luciferous, yet watery lustre, lest it blind my Reader, but truly and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to discover them, their nature and use, with that reall and feacible advantage
may be made thereof, which will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie a sober spirit; and if by chance I
make a discovery of what is concealed, much good may it doe the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
for I shall reap the fruit of my design, <hi>An opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to discover
publique Advantages.</hi> And whosoever desires cordially to be informed of Mr.
<hi>Speed</hi> may from Mr. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Hartlib,</hi> dwelling against
<hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> who can give fuller and larger description both of the
man and his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, having expressed him self so far a Gentleman of such
charity towards him, as he hath maintained him divers monoths together while he
was inventing some of these his discoveries as I was informed from a very

 shall speak little to what other publique spirits have discovered, but enlarge
 a little from later experience in relation to our English Lands and
 Husbandry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are so many sorts of Claver, as would fill a

 <hi>Clusius, Trifolliummajus tertium,</hi> which bares the great red
 Honysuckle, whose leaf and branches far exceeds our naturall Meadow Claver; it
 bears a very small seed as Mustard seed,<note place="margin">Right seed is the
best peece in the whole work.</note> not so round but longer like a Bean; the
 best is of a greenish yellow colour, some a little reddish, but the black I
 fear will not doe well. The <pb n="179" facs="tcp:54116:104"/> choice whereof is the onely
 peece in the whole work.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Dutch, Holland,</hi> or <hi>Low Country</hi> Seed, or
 from the lower parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> is very much of it very hazardous
 that comes over hither, but being well chose there, the tans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of it by
 sea is no considerable prejudice unto it, but much that is sold in the
 Seed-mens shops in <hi>London</hi> was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupted by the <hi>Dutch</hi>
 before it came thence, or else parched by over-drying, or else by the
 Shop-keepers, either mingling old and new, or keeping it another year and then
 selling it for new: I my self within this four year sowed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Acres with
 seed bought in <hi>London,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Claver sowed but none came
up.</note> which cost me about two shilllings a pound and lost it all; I am not
 able to say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one seed came up at all. And I have heard that the
 <hi>Dutch</hi> out of an evill spirit, lest we should find the same benefit
 they have, have kiln-dryed it. Therfore my advice is, to send over a knowing
 man that hath had experience of it, &amp; knows the right coloured seed to buy,
 and search all the Countrey and buy the best and choicest Seed he can possibly
 buy for Silver, and take care of the bringing of it over too; and as for the
 sale of it, if you bring over more than you shall use, you need not, nor shall
 not want customers to take it off of hand; for I had rather give a double price
 for such, than run the hazard of common Merchants experience.</p>
                  <p>But if you desire me to speak my mind from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence my
 self hath made,<note place="margin">The best is of our own grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> I do
 affirm that our own Seed, that is, Seed of our own Claver, after the first
 sowing of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Seed, called the great Claver, is the best, and
 most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Seed to grow, and so successively from time to time, if you can
 ripen it kindly, get it dry, and preserve it. And this will bring me to my
 second particular.</p>
                  <p>Which is how to get good Seed, or recover it out of
 our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> own Crop to sow again, if you could get it kindly out of
 the husk, which to us as yet is a mystery, and we cannot doe it artificially
 and feacibly as they do in <hi>Flaunders.</hi> The best means we do use is to
 thrash it out of the straw; and then chave it or clense it from the straw, as
 you do corn, and then polt it, or faulter it as some call it, that is, beat it
 over again in the husk, and then get out as much of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse 
 <pb n="180" facs="tcp:54116:105"/> by chaving of it with a narrow toothed Rake as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
 you can get;<note place="margin">I have heard of one that got above 2 bush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
out of an Acre.</note> which done, if you would bestow sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it in a hot
 dry season, and then rubbing of it, will get very much of it, for this is all
 the means that hitherto I have ever heard of in <hi>England,</hi> but I am
 confident that it may be very feacibly got forth of the husk, being very
 throughly dryed in the Sun, upon a Corn-mill, Oatmeal, or Mault-mill, and
 shelled as they do Oats, by a skilfull Miller, and no seed hurt as they will
 Oats, and not break the kernel, having his Mill-stones exceeding levell hung,
 neither too sharp nor too dull,<note place="margin">A new way of getting out the
Clover forth of the husk.</note> and very curiously set that it cut not the
 seed, nor yet leave too much seed behind; which if it prove, as I am confident
 it will, it will be a very great advuntage to the Nation. This upon the very
 writing hereof came into my mind, which I am very confident of the performance
 of the work, and resolve to make the experience therof, if God bless my Crop of
 Glaver this summer. So far as I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto seen or heard, our own seed
 sowed in the husk, hath proved the best, thicker and certainer than that sowed
 of the pure seed it self, and so shall fall into the third particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                  <p>The best way of sowing of it, &amp; I do verily beleeve, that
 if the husk be but once cut and shivered a little that the Seed may but
 scatter, that it may be best to sow it with the husk or chaff because it
 supplys the filling of the hand better than any thing I can find out will doe,
 with these two Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>1 That you be sure to find out a fit proportion of husk and
 seed together to sow an Acre, &amp; that I cannot prescribe, unless I knew how
 clean you could make it; your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will discover that perfectly.</p>
                  <p>2 That you be sure ever and anon to stir up the bottom of your
 Hopper, or Seed-lop, because the Seed will sink downward, and keep your seed
 and chaff alwaies in an even mixture and composition, lest you sow that part
 thicker in the bottom than that that lay overmost; but should you fail of
 purifying the seed from the chaff for private vse it may do best of all, if the
 hop bowl or husk be but cut and <pb n="181" facs="tcp:54116:105"/> shattered as aforesaid:
 but if you sow that Dutch seed, as that you must of necessity till you get into
 stock of seed of your own, then the best way of sowing it must be by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of
 it with Ashes of wood, or coal coarsly sifted or with saw-dust, or good sand or
 fine mould, or any thing else that wil help to fill the hand, &amp; wil spread
 wel forth of the hand, but I like not wel the taking it up betwixt the fingers
 &amp; the thumb; or the two fore fingers and the thumb, because they cannot
 scatter the seed so broad nor so even as they can out of their ful hand. And
 this I must press as one of the most weightiest things in this Husbandry; to
 have a most especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care of the even sowing of it, your care herein must be
 far more than in sowing Corn for these Reasons.</p>
                  <p>1 Because the Corn with much harrowing (which this will not
 abide) though uneven sowed will be drawn into wants and uneven places, and much
 regulated by the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                  <p>2 Because your Corn is of a heavier and fuller, and weightier
 substance, and will spread well of it self, but this is so small and little in
 bulk, sowes a land that it cannot be discerned how it spreads, and whether even
 or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the wind, though very small, hath powe over this,
 and not over the other, and how ever you must chuse a calm time as possibly you
 can, many times early in the morning,<note place="margin">Best time to sow
Claver.</note> or late at even are your calmest times. You may sow it upon any
 Land you intend to graze upon, any bare places in a Meadow or highwaies troden
 and poched, and it will soard them; but the usuall way is thus advised, when
 you have fitted your land by Tillage and good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, then sow your Barley
 or Oats, and Harrow them in, and after your Claver upon the same Land, and
 covered once with a small Harrow or Bush, but sow not the Corn thick as you
 usually did, but if you will lose this Crop, you may sow it of it self.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, because if your Corn should miscarry, it is but
 for one year; but this for many: and as you sow once you must often reap, and
 will never cover or soard kindly, if <pb n="182" facs="tcp:54116:106"/> evenness be not
 effected, to the compleating of which you must have a sober staied Seedsman,
 that carries his hand high; takes his steps even, and delivers his seed out of
 his hand at one equall and constant breadth and wideness. It is my constant cry
 to my own Husbandmen to take heed of Ploough-balking, and Harrow balking, but
 now I say in a more especiall manner, take heed of Seed-balking. The best
 season for it is in the beginning of <hi>Aprill,</hi> or in the end of
 <hi>March</hi> rather, if it be likely to be a dry season; late sowing may do
 in a fruitfull season, but yearly is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth particular is how to preserve it,
 and mow it, and make it most usefull for Seed and service, I have heard much
 talk of three Crops, and truly if it be not reserved forseed, I am confident in
 a fruitfull year it will well bear it, nay may be more; for thongh I love not
 fauning, neither affect I smothering the Thuth nor to eclipse any new
 dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, I therefore say that if the Seed be good, and the Land either good
 naturall, or artificially made good by Husbandry it may very well bear three
 Crops, two to cut, and one to graze, and the first Crop may by mid-<hi>May</hi>
 be ready to cut; for this I say, and most will find it, though they otherwise
 speak high, that this grass will be best alway to be cut green, and before the
 stalk begin to grow too big, and begin to dye and wither, unless it be for
 seed: Thefrore, as experience will teach, it will be excellent good to cut it
 green and young, and give it cattle or horse in the house; for if you cut it to
 keep, it will go so near together, as it wil doe but little service dry, yet
 being cut young it will be very good and sweet, and either feed or give milk
 abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; and then after the first cut, let it grow for seed, and herein you
 must be carfull that it grow till it be full ripe, for it will not be very apt
 to shed. And if it grow to seed,<note place="margin">To know when tis full
ripe.</note> I cannot conceive of what use those stalks which are so hard and
 dry can be of, unless it be for Firing in a dear Country, so that the seed must
 be the advance of that Crop onely; and so it may well enough, and you may have
 a good after pasture, and may grase it untill <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and then
 pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preserve <pb n="183" facs="tcp:54116:106"/> it; but if you would know when your Seed is
 ripe, observe these two particulars.</p>
                  <p>First observe the husk, and when the Seed first appears in it,
 then about one month after it may be ripe.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, try the seed after it begins to turn the
 co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the stalk begins to dye and turn brown, it begins to ripen, and
 being turned to a yellowish colour, in a dry time mow it, and preserve it till
 it be perfectly dry any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way, and then about the middest of
 <hi>March</hi> thrash it and cleanse it from the straw as much as you can, and
 then foulter and beat the husk again being exceeding well dryed in the Sun
 after the first thrashing;<note place="margin">When and how to get one the
seed.</note> and then get out what seed you can, and after try what a Mill will
 do at the rest, as aforesaid more at large; but I will give way to a better
 Discovery. I need not prescribe a time either in <hi>Iuly</hi> or
 <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> as best to cut for seed, because some years and lands will
 ripen it sooner than other will; therefore have respect to thy seed and straw
 according to former directions; but when thou art got into good seed, thou
 maist graze it upon thy land, and then be sure not to let it grow too rank and
 high; for if the stalk grow big, cattell will balk it and stain it more, and it
 will not eat up so kindly at first, nor grase so even afterward,<note place="margin">Yeelds much Milk, and feeds fat Beef</note> but exceeding much
 Milk it will yeeld, and feed very well, but to affirm as some have done, and do
 confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently unto this day, that it will grow upon the barrennest ground as is
 on <hi>Windsor</hi> Forrest I dare not;<note place="margin">A great mistake about
Claver.</note> I have known that there it hath failed; and I am confident must,
 without exceeding great cost and husbandry, yet that very Land well Manured and
 Tilled, Dunged, Limed, Marled, or Chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or otherwise made fat and warm,
 will bring forth good Glover: and other rich commodities, as they do in
 <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> upon so coarse Lands bestow good cost, and that will do:
 The nature of the Land is good, bnt the spirit of it is too low to raise it of
 it self. And this is all is held forth in the discourse of the <hi>Brabant</hi>
 Husbandry, exceeding bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Lands, but well Dunged and Tilled, and then
 Clave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; not that it is the barren Land, but the good and costly Husbandry;
 onely the oldness of the Land, and restiness <pb n="184" facs="tcp:54116:107"/> thereof
 yeelds more spirit to the Grain or Claver by far than the Tillable Land
 constantly plowed,<note place="margin">Old land better for Claver than
tillable.</note> and being of the same fatness and barrenness, and no better;
 yet I verily affirm that Tillable Land well husbanded, and layd down with
 Claver, will do very well also. The quantity of seed to sow an Acre,<note place="margin">How
much seed sowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>han Acre.</note> as
 I conceive, will be a Gallon, or 9 or 10 pound, though some are of opinion less
 will serve turn. And so I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to my last particular, which is,</p>
                  <p>5 To set forth the Lands most suitable for Claver, with the
 annuall Profit that comes thereby.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, as above, I say your old Land, be it coarse or
 rich, as it is, or hath been disused from Tillage long, is best for Corn; so
 also is it the best and certain Land to Claver; and when you have corned your
 Land as much as you intend, then to alter it to Claver is the properest
 sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>1 As to the nature of the Land, as I conceive your dry, warm
 Land,<note place="margin">The lands most proper for the Clover</note> naturally
 good, betwixt ten and twenty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings an acre, or your poorer dry Land,
 betwixt one shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ten shillings an acre, well manured or soyled, and
 brought into perfect Tillage; and to speak properly and plainest, any Land that
 will bear good Corn, wil bear good Claver.</p>
                  <p>2 Your earthy, well mixed Land, of a middle temper, will do
 with good Husbandry as aforesaid, as well as the former.</p>
                  <p>And lastly your naturall cold Land, well Husbandryed, laid up
 very dry and warm, and brought into good Tillage, every Land laid high, as the
 nature and coldness of the Land requires, and every furlong drained, and the
 furrows cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by the Plough at last, wil bring almost any Lands into a
 very good condition for Claver, and the better husbandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the better for this
 use also.</p>
                  <p>This I shall lay down for a generall Rule,<note place="margin">A
generall rule in Clavering.</note> that whatever Land is neither to rank or fat
 for any sort of Corne what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, is not too good to Claver, and you shall
 alway find it best Husbandry, and best pofit upon your best Land, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as
 aforesaid, you recover the barren Lands up to a good <pb n="185" facs="tcp:54116:107"/> and
 rich condition, which is also the far better Husbandry than to lie pelting and
 moyling upon poor mean Land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatned by some soyls or other, therefore I
 advise every man to plow up no more than he can exceeding well overcome by his
 purse and husbandry, and let the rest lie till he have brought up his other,
 and then as he hath raised one part take up another, and lay down that to
 grase, either with Clover or otherwise: And let him that flatters himself to
 raise goed Clover upon barren heathy Land otherwise than as aforesaid, pull
 down his Plumes after two or thee years experience, unless he devise a new way
 of Husbandry.</p>
                  <p>And as to the annuall Profit that may accrew thereby,<note place="margin">The Annuall profit of Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Grass.</note> I shall little differ
 from the <hi>Flaunders</hi> Husbandry, but shall affirm that one acre after the
 Corn is cut the very next year if it be well Husbandryed, and kind thick
 Claver, may be worth twenty Marks, or twelve pound, and so down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as it
 degenerates weaker, less worth. In <hi>Brabant</hi> they speak of keeping four
 Cowes Winter and Summer, some cut and laid up for fodder, others cut and eaten
 green; but I have credibly heard of some in <hi>England,</hi> that upon about
 one Acre have kept four Coach horses, and more al Summer long, but if it keep
 but two Cowes, it is advantage enough upon such Lands as never kept one: But I
 conceive best for us, untill we be come into a stock of Seed, to mow the first
 Crop in the midst or end of <hi>May,</hi> and lay that up for hay, although it
 will go very near together, yet if it grow not too strong, it will be exceeding
 good and rich, and feed any thing, and reserve the next for Seed: And if we can
 bring it up to perfect seed, and it will but yeeld four bushels upon an acre,
 it will amount to more than I speak of by far, every bushel being wooth three
 or four pound a bushel; and then the after math, or eadish that year may put up
 three midling Runts upon an acre, and feed them up: all which layd together
 will make up an Improvement sufficient,<note place="margin">Clover

clovering.</note> and yet this propety it hath also; that after the three or
 four first years of Clovering, it will so frame the earth, that it will be very
 fit to Corn agaen, which will be a very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: First to corn your
 Land, which usuall yeelds a far <pb n="186" facs="tcp:54116:108"/> better profit than
 grasing, and sometimes a double profit, and sometimes more, near a treble
 profit, and then to Clover it again, which will afford a treble, fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fold yea 10 or 12 fold Advance, if not
 more. And so if you consider one Acre of land with the Claver and Husbandry
 thereof, may stand you the first year in twenty five shilling, the three other
 years not above ten shillings, the Land being worth no more, which may produce
 you yearly, easily five, six, or eight pound <hi>per annum per</hi> Acre; nay
 some will affirm ten, or twelve pound or more; then most of my Improvements
 promised are made good, as in my Frontspiece is he'd forth under this first

 Foyne a French Grass, of which I mnst use plain dealing, and not put my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

 for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer discourse I promised to bring down to our practice some Out-landish
 Experiments which were hinted at and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto Mr. <hi>Hartlib</hi> by
 Letter to be a great deficiencie to us in our Improvements the non-practice
 thereof; so I must, and will hold forth no more than I can make proof of to the
 face of the world. Therefore my self having not made a full Experiment thereof,
 onely I have sowed of it this year, shall give the relation of the manner of
 the Husbandry thereof, and the fruit you may rationally expect, and the Lands
 upon which it is to be sowen, and so leave it and you to your own experience
 and Gods blessing.</p>
                  <p>I shall not trouble you with the description of it as an
 Herbalist, because as in this, so in no other is it my design to search out the
 nature of any Herb or Plant in it self, but <pb n="187" facs="tcp:54116:108"/> as it is
 most profitable or usefull for my main design, <hi>The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of
 Land</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. Eoyn is a French Grass much sowed there,<note place="margin">The descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of St. Foyn.</note> upon their barren, dry, hasky
 Lands, and sometimes in our Gardens hath a kind of it been much sowed, called
 the French Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suckel; it is of one excellent property yeeldeth abundance of
 Milk, and upon that account may be very advantagious to many parts of the
 Nation: it groweth best as it is said, upon the barrennest lands, hilly and
 mountainous, which I am induced to beleeve upon this score, because it is
 rendred to be worth but nine or ten shillings an Acre, which some would not
 think worth experimenting, but if so, and it will grow upon our worst land, I
 am sure there is thousand thousands of Acres in <hi>England,</hi> not worth one
 shilling an Acre, and if that being sowen upon such land it will with one
 sowing advance it to that worth, and so continue for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers years, it is very
 well worth our imitation and practice; it will raise betwixt a load and a half,
 and two load of an Acre: Besides it is rendred to have another excellent
 quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is not to barrennize Land, but to better or fatten it, and
 after seven years growing it so roots large and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, somwhat like Licorish,
 that the Plowing up of them, is a very good soyl, and much fattens the Land for
 Corn: it is excellent for soarding Land the first year a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. It
 hath been sowed in divers parts of <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
 Park in <hi>Kent,</hi> &amp;c. where it thrived very well upon chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie dry
 banks.</p>
                  <p>The seed is first to be had out of <hi>France,</hi> where it
 is sold for about three pence or a groat a pound, but here it was sold very
 dear at nine pence; ten pence, or twelve pence a pound this yrar. It is most
 like a Parsnip seed, only a little browner in colour, and somewhat rounder and
 fuller made like an Oyster, it is very light, and so many pounds go to a
 strike, and it must be sowed far more in quantity than you doe the Claver seed,
 because it is so great a seed; for ever the smaller the seed the further it
 goeth: I conceive for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very pound of Claver you sow, you had need sow two of
 this, if not more; but I leave it to your own experience, <pb n="188" facs="tcp:54116:109"/> you will easily find a fitting proportion upon the first tryall; but
 the thicker the closer it grows, and stocks the ground the better, and
 destroyes other seed or weeds.</p>
                  <p>The manner of sowing it may be with Oats or Barly &amp; so
 much as grows up with the Barley may be cut with it,<note place="margin">The
manner of sowing it.</note> and then preserved, or else if it be very
 fruitfull, it may be moed in the latter end of the year, and then preserve it
 for mowing for six or seven years after; for by that time it will have lost the
 spirit of it and be overcome by our English grasses; and then be fitter to plow
 for Corn again.</p>
                  <p>But if men will be at charge, the best way commended to me is
 this, to prepare your Lands and make them fine, as when you sow barley, and
 then plow in these seeds as the great Gardeners do their Pease, yet not
 altogether at so great a distance; but yet let them make their ranges near a
 foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance one betwixt another, and the grass will flourish like Pease
 especially if they draw the plow throngh them once, or twice that summer to
 destroy all the weeds; but whereas he speaks of using the great Claver thus
 also, I am somewhat jealous he is mistaken herein, because the thicker it grows
 and the closer, with one continued thickness, the better either to mow or
 grase, The experimenting I leave to thee.</p>
                  <p>There is also the La-lucern,<note place="margin">La
lucern.</note> another French Grass, which is excellent Fodder, and is rather
 preferred before the St. Foine, and it is as advantagious to dry and barren
 lands, and hath been lately discovered there, and is now of great credit
 amongst them, but for my own particular experience, I can say little and
 therefore say thus much, only to provoke the Ingenious both unto the search,
 experimenting, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to publick view, not one man being sufficient
 for the experimenting all discoveries that may be made here, and elsewhere, I
 am confident every Age, nay every day will bring forth something or other worth
 our embracements.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Discovers the severall Abuses of the
 Plough.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I proceed in this discourse, I will lay down these two
 or three Maxims or Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                  <p>First, that whatever moveth upon the Land, or that worketh in
 the Land, and carrieth the least earth or weight with it, must needs move or
 work easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. A wheel the lesser ground it stands upon, the easier it turns,
 and the lesser the wheel the easier still; so the Plough, the more earth or
 weight it carries with it, the more strength must be required. The naturall
 furrow it must carry, but the lesser compass both in heigth and length it bears
 upon the Plough, the easier the Plough must go.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the more naturally any thing moves, the more easily,
 and the more Artificially, the more difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the sharper or thinner is any tool, the easier it
 pierceth, and the less strength is required; so contrary, the thicker or duller
 any tool is, the more strength must work it; and;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:54116:110"/>Fourthly, that which is the plainest and
 truest to the Rule, and admits of least multiplication of work, must needs be
 easiest.</p>
                  <p>All my endeavours shall onely be the application of all these
 to the Plough, and that as naturally as I can by truth of Workmanship, to
 discover the Plough and Plough-Irons to the most exactness, which will be all
 the ease that I can give it, or any man yet ever did or could: If any other
 shall endeavour to discover by Engine or otherwise, to supply the strength of
 horse and man to draw the Plough, I know an easie Plough will go more easie,
 and shall therin rejoyce.</p>
                  <p>And because I find so many different names given to the
 members of the Plough according to the Country phrazes, &amp; few of one
 Country understands another Countries terms, I shall confine my self to one
 name to each member all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long my discourse, for the better understanding of
 the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>As for the Plough-sheath, Wrest, Beam, Share, and Coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
 they retain these names clearly in most parts and so I shal continue them.</p>
                  <p>But for Plough-handles, some call them Stilts, and some Hales,
 and some Staves I shall confine my self to the name of Handles.</p>
                  <p>For the Plough-head, some call them the Plough-throck, some
 the Plough-chip, &amp;c. I shall retain the term of Plough-head.</p>
                  <p>And the Shield-board, some call Breast-board, or Earth-board,
 or Furrow-board, I shall retaine the Shield board.</p>
                  <p>And for the Coumb, or Whing of the Share, which is that which
 goeth upward upon the Shield-board, I shall term the Coumb.</p>
                  <p>And for the Tush or Phin of the Share, which is that that
 cutteth out the bottom of the Furrow as the Fish doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the water, I
 shall call it the Phin of the Share, &amp; so I shall avoyd multiplication of
 tearms, and a littl shorten and clear my discourse, and so proceed.</p>
                  <p>As for the giving an addition of ease unto an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 
 <pb n="191" facs="tcp:54116:110"/> way of plowing, and the taking away of some of the
 strength which is so great a burthen to the Husbandmans, is of very vast
 concernment, and will take up a very large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course the effecting whereof I
 shall endeavour under these following heads.</p>
                  <p>1 To discover the severall abuses or hindrances to the
 welll-going of the plough, with some remedies thereto.</p>
                  <p>2 To give you the descriptions, with the Figures of several
 sorts of ploghs now in use.</p>
                  <p>3 To demonstrate wherein the chief ease of the plough
 consists, with the easiest growing plough and the advantage gained thereby.</p>
                  <p>4 To discover to what sorts of Land and seasons of plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
 each plough is most suitable, with a double plough yet unknown, and a plough
 that shall both plow and harrow at once.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Abuses</hi> or hindrances to be removed are many,
 wherein I shall speak to particular abuses only.</p>
                  <p>And first I shall speak to particular abuses only
 pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to the ploughs easie going in the
 Blacksmith,<note place="margin">Plough irons made very true.</note> or he that
 makes the Irons for the plovgh, I not being of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as many are, that
 the Irons should be made to the plough, but that the plough be made to the
 irons; I therefore shall be bold to say, that if Plough Irons be not made
 exceeding true in all points, according to the Land you have to plow, and
 wrought fair and smooth, a plough-wright or plow maker shall not, nor cannot
 work true to a false foundation and if it be not wrought true, it shall hardly
 go true, unless after much wearing, being wrought into work, it may plow;
 reasonable well at last, and by that time the plough may be worn out, but never
 with that ease, nor continuance as it would by truth of Workmanship: Another
 abuse in him is the not steeling his plough-irons well, and making them
 ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding sharp and well pointed.</p>
                  <p>The second abuse is in the plough-maker, who works ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
 to certain coarse Rules he hath learned by trade, knows not how to hold a
 plough himself, nor to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <pb n="192" facs="tcp:54116:111"/> to the nature of
 the Land according to the alteration of it, nor scarce is able to discern the
 falsity of the Smiths work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship; and is not able to apply himself to all
 sorts of Lands, or those severall sorts of Tilths the Husbandman gives, he
 shall never make a Plough to go with ease by his rules, unless he chop upon it
 by chance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third abuse may be in the Plough-holder,
 and if he have not abilities to order his Plough, to fix and alter his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
 and his Plough too, according to the severall natures of Lands he ploweth, and
 according to the manner of his Plowing, and keep his Irons in a true and keen
 posture; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he is to cast down his Land, sometime to raise up, and
 sometime to plow up hill and down, sometime even levell Grounds, in all which
 if he have not some good experience, though both Smith and Plough wrights do
 their parts, yet because the Plough-holder cannot be made aswell as the Plough,
 many good Ploughs are utterly spoyled in the usage or abusage</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> May be in the Lands, when the Lands as some
 almost at any time, or with any Ploughs are not workable; or when Land is
 over-wet or over-dry: now all Ploughs are not to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Lands, nor at all
 times but men must be so knowing, as to have their severall Ploughs for each
 sort of Land and seasons, otherwise they will moyle horse, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, and Ploughs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the discovering some remedies or cures against these
 abuses,<note place="margin">The remedies of the ploughs abuses.</note> and first
 as to the Smith, his Truth of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship lieth chief in these three materials
 of the Plough, I the Share, 2 the Coulter, 3 the Shield or Breast-plate (as
 some call them) Shivers: All which they being made true, and according to the
 naturall cast of the surrow, that so the earth stick not upon the Plough, but
 the Irons wear bright and clean, it is a good sign of the truth of Workmanship
 on his part. I shall onely prescribe these particulars for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of
 the Share; if it be a Share made with a pan to put upon a wooden head, then I
 do advise the pan be made pretty deep, and somewhat deeper than our ordinary
 Shares are made, but not too large or wide a pan in bredth, and the 
 <pb n="193" facs="tcp:54116:111"/> phin made broad, descending or whelmiug to the right
 hand; it hath these two advantages; first the deeper the pan is, the thicker
 and stronger may the head be put on, and the longer it will last.</p>
                  <p>2 The Tush or Phin of the Share will whelm the more being set
 down to the work which is the Levell or bottom of the head, or rather a little
 lower,<note place="margin">A description of the plain share.</note> which will
 give great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to it of clearing the earth at the throat, or first
 en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon the nose of the Shield-board with more ease, for if it stick
 there, it will be gone all along the Plough at once: A Share made most hanging
 from the very nose of the Breast-board, and not flat as most are; the figure
 whereof could I describe it like the side of a hill into a level meddow, would
 give a perfect demonstration of it, which I shall endeavour as near as I can;
 it should be pitched or set upon the Plough-head somewhat hanging also on the
 right hand, and the Plough-head pitched hanging also: As for the breadth of it,
 I leave that to each mans experience as his land requires; if upon a stony
 land, or twichy woody Land, it must be nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, and the more flinty the
 narrower; but if it be upon a gravelly it may increase in bredth, and so it may
 upon a clay, and more upon a mixed earth, and more upon a pure earth of sand,
 and most of all upon the Lay-turf, however upon all I would have it cut up very
 cleanly the full bredth of the Furrow thou carriest with thee, and not rend and
 tear it up with the breadth of the Plough, which increaseth the weight and
 strength; and most Ploughs are guilty of this inconvenience, especially where
 they goe with their narrow long pointed shares.</p>
                  <p>But now if you demaund whether it be best to have the Coumb or
 Wing fixed to the Share, or put into the Share with a hole through and Riveted
 below, or whether to have none at all, but onely a shiver or plate upon the
 Breast or Shield-board, placed curiously upon the Share, exceeding tite, and as
 closely filled and wrought to the Sharepan as may be.</p>
                  <p>I answer, first, that could you have the Coumb or Wing so
 fixed, welded, or wrought solidly to the Share, with its <pb n="194" facs="tcp:54116:112"/>
 true whelming, hollow, cross winding, compass, just answr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cast or turn
 of the Furrow, which cannot be descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by a Figure: this being wrought fair
 and smooth, and as broad as possible you can get it, wil be the best. And this
 is reasonable well done in many parts of <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> in some parts
 of <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> and <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other
 parts, onely the Wing or Coumb is not broad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nongh; but the best pattern for
 this is upon the Bastard-Dutch Ploughs, who work them so broad, as they cover
 all the nose of the Breast-board, eight or nine inches broad, and twelve or
 thirteen inches high, and give the truest compass of any: I have seen of this
 fashion in <hi>Holland</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> and many there are of
 them upon the Marshes and Sea-coast of <hi>Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi>
 and <hi>Essex,</hi> where the Dutch plough is much used, but the true Dutch
 share is otherwise so costly, and made especially for boggy <hi>soft</hi> land,
 very troublesome and curious to be wrought, and more curious to be kept, and by
 our Countrey men the nicety of it will not be endured, nor indeed will it work
 in most part of our Country Lands, and therefore I forbear further incoragement
 thereto, than to this small branch thereof. The weelding compass of the
 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umb.</p>
                  <p>But as to the fixing or weelding on the Coumb, I stand
 indifferent, because I think there is another way as good and easie, however
 let the Share without the Coumb be made as aforesaid, and then with a Shiner or
 Breast-plate curiously wrought a little hollowish at the nose, and so
 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing along, being placed so close to the Share, that grass straw, roots,
 or weeds get not betwixt it and the Share to choak it in the Breast; for then
 it is utterly spoyled of its case: the Shiner will do best to be continued all
 along the Breast-board one solid plate compassed and cross winding from the
 middle; the over end forward looking one way towards the Land, and the over end
 backward towards the furrow; and so must all your shield or breast boards be
 hewen or sawen, and compassed with fire, and wrought fair or smooth afterward.
 This shiner if wrought fair, as high as the earth works upon the plough, and
 have his true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass <pb n="195" facs="tcp:54116:112"/> with the Breast board, may also
 be of excellent ease to the plough; for after it hath gone, and is scoured
 bright, the earth will slip off, and pass away with much ease, and will carry
 no earth at all, which is to the great ease of the plough; and both these are
 better than a Coumb put through the Share-pan, and so come up along the nose of
 the Shield-board, and there nayled to strengthen the neck of the plough, or
 else put up into the plough-beam to strengthen it either; yet this I also
 prefer before those that have neither this, nor the aforesaid helps. And as for
 other fashioned Shares, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made to the single wheeled plough, or to the
 double wheeled plough, whether with a pan, or without a pan, it matters not, so
 that at the first entrance of the earth it be rightly compassed, and cast for
 the cleanly running over the furrow, and the Share point made very small, sharp
 and well steeled, be it long or short.</p>
                  <p>2 As to the Coulter, his truth of Workmanship lyeth in this,
 whether it be Dutch or English Coulter,<note place="margin">The Coulter how best
made</note> that it be well steeled and wrought sharp and thin on the edge; the
 point al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so looking forward, if English, and the edge alway placed just
 forward, neither carving, or turning towards the Land, for that will alway be
 apt to draw the plough too wide, nor yet into the furrow, for that will be
 alway apt to work it to go too narrow, but just straight forward by a straight
 line to the pitch of the plough; but if a Dutch Coulter,<note place="margin">The
Dutch Coulter.</note> then the wheel to be very well steeled, and about ten
 inches high, and to go as true as possible; for the false cutting of the wheel
 will make you work at a great uncertainty, which Coulter is not usefull neither
 upon stony, gravelly, flinty, broomy, gossy, or rooty ground, but upon pure
 turf, or pure mould, on which it goeth very easie.</p>
                  <p>The midst of the wheel had need be an inch thick because of
 wearing, and so wrought thinner and thinner towards the edge round, untill it
 come to be as thin as a knife if it were possible; but because this Coulter is
 with many of high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem, and of some advantage, and yet not much known, I
 will give you the figure of it, as also of the best sort of English, for its
 compass, and a sharp thin well tempered edge, that <pb n="196" facs="tcp:54116:113"/> tends
 most to the ease of our English Coulter, and it shall be where I give the
 description of the Ploughs I intend to shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow forth.</p>
                  <p>And as the Plough-holder or Ploughman may much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the
 easie going of the Plough, so one rightly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied may in great measure
 advantage it, although the Plough be made never so exact and true; and
 therefore I give these two or three generall Rules to the Plough-holder, which
 are naturall to any sort of ploughs whatever, although there are some different
 rules appertenant to some particular Ploughs, as the double wheeled plough, and
 the Turnwrest <hi>Kentish</hi> ploughs, which would be too tedious to
 discourse, but these I leave to the plough-mans practice being easily found out
 by two or three dayes experience.</p>
                  <p>The first generall Rule shall be that the plough-man be able
 to judge and determine within himself the truth both of the plough-wright, and
 the Smiths workmanship, and in case he find an errour therein at first to mend
 it, which is far easier done than after the plough or irons be wrought into a
 greater error; yea that it is possible it may not be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, having his plough and all his Accutrements
 compleated, then to the triall of it,<note place="margin">The best way for the
tryall of a new plough.</note> and therein be sure to make the first tryall of
 your plough vpon land workable, and regular lands, not upon lands above measure
 hard rooty, rushy, twichy, or any way unfeacible, because upon such lands a
 true demonstration of the goodness and truth of the plough cannot be
 discovered, nor any Rule can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
                  <p>2 Because such lands will more easily and suddenly wrench,
 writh, or put a new plough out of its work before it be wrough into its work. A
 rough new plough being somewhat like an unbroken horse, which may easily be
 spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the hand of a violent mad-cap Rider, but if the horse be kindly
 used, and taken of his untamedness by degrees, by ease, kindness and patience,
 he is made a horse for ever; so after that in ordinary land, your patient
 discreet plough-man have well scoured your plough, brought it to a true 
 <pb n="197" facs="tcp:54116:113"/> furrow both for breadth and depth, and set your Irons as
 it will goe it self with the very bearing of the hand to keep it steady, then
 you may afterward be bold to put it to any service, or any lands whatsoever the
 strength of it will abide, and it may be serviceable for many years.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly let him be sure having once got his plough into a
 perfect furrow, his plough avoiding all the earth as it takes it on at Breast,
 and carrying a fair clean furrow along with it, and turning its furrow
 cleaverly also from it, then let him not neglect a day, but iron his plough
 with slips or clouts in all the wearing places, smooth and even, and strengthen
 the neck of it with an iron bolt,<note place="margin">Plough well clouted, and
irons sharp &amp; smooth kept.</note> from the bottom of the head through the
 beam, and there strongly drawn up and cottered fast, if he have none before,
 that the Head may not draw the least, for after a plough is drawn in the Neck
 or Breast, it is probably wholly spoyled; and then alway be carefull in keeping
 your Irons sharp, and clean wrought, your Coulter edge thin ground, and Share
 phin as sharp as may be, and very small point upon your share, all well steeled
 and tempered, your plough shall go with great ease and truth.</p>
                  <p>But lastly, the plough-man must have a little regard to his
 Teem or Draught, and to the well geering or ordering them, if he will take all
 advantages he may or ought for ease, and therefore must alway make his Horse or
 Ox as sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as may be, not some high and some low, but of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality as
 even as may bee, much might bee spoken herein by way of reprehension and advice
 too but I must forbear, onely advise that if your horses be unequall for
 height, then place the highest formost, and so your higher next, and your
 lowest last; many reasons may be given therefore; however make your Horses and
 Oxen as equallas you can possibly,<note place="margin">Size your Horses or Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
equal.</note> if they be unsizeable, your highest draw up your lowest, and your
 lowest draw down the highest therfore endeavonring all you can that all draw by
 a streight line is best, and preserves the full strength of your Teem or
 Draught for your plough, which otherwise you lose a very confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part
 thereof, and let your Gears or Harness be strong and easie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:54116:114"/>Secondly be as carefull as in sizing
 them for their height, so also in matching them for their spirit as near as you
 can. A horse of a dull sluggish spirit, and heavy, is fittest for slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish
 service such as your heavy loads, or weighty draughts, fitter for carting than
 plowing; your quick lively spirited Horses will be best for your plough, and
 the dull horses will be best to be placed together at what service soever, and
 then they will not deceive their fellows, which many times is the spoyl of many
 a good horse; your false deceitfull Horse that will draw but at his own
 pleasure, and fail you and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows at a stand or dead lift, as we say, is
 exceeding unservice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and must be avoyded as much as is possible: Yet if he
 be quick sprited, and full of metall, he may do best at plough and harrowing,
 and being sized with his fellows is usefullest in that service of any other
 whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he must be able to judge of his Land, and the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
 of plowing, and to sort his severall ploughs to each al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, otherwise he
 shall not be able to plow all his Lands, nor indeed any at some seasons; and
 because of this I shall say more hereafter,<note place="margin">A good cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a good Plough-man.</note> I shall dismiss my plough-man with this
 exhortment, be as willing to learn as thou hast need, and abandon those poor
 silly shifts men make to preserve themselves ignorant and unserviceable, as
 they have been plough-men all their dayes and are not now to learn, and men may
 as well be too precise, and better ploughs cannot be made than their Country
 affords, and could better have been devised they would long since: With
 hundreds more so childish, as are not worth an Answer, but these exceedingly
 stifle and choak Invention, and will do my Readers Imitation of these rude
 Discoveries.</p>

 the description of the severall Ploughes in use, and shew you the defects in
 some, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages others have, and what Addition I can give both from
 my own Observations, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, to make up as compleat an easie Plough as
 my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will make out.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall therefore confine my discourse to three or four sorts
 of ploughs.</p>
                  <p>First the Wheel-plough, I mean the double wheeled plough.</p>
                  <p>2. The single wheeled plough, and the foot plough.</p>
                  <p>3. The simple plain plough, without wheel or foot.</p>
                  <p>4. The Dutch Bastard, or plain Dutch plough.</p>
                  <p>Many other sorts there are, as some alter in their heads, some
 in their Beams, some in their Stilts, &amp;c. and most in their Shares, and all
 almost according to the Country of which they are, of al which it were too
 endless to discourse but I onely name these, because I conceive all these
 usefull in some sort of Land or other, and a good husband had need be stored
 with two or three sorts of them at all times, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he that hath severall
 sorts of Lands, of all which I shall say but little, yet a word of each; but I
 shall reserve the main of my discourse for those very particular branches of
 the plough that shall make out that I shall give ease ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                  <p>And first, as for the double wheeled plough commonly 
 <pb n="200" facs="tcp:54116:115"/> called the Wheel-ploug, and is of most constant use in
 <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> and many up-Countries; and is very usefull upon all
 flinty, stony, or hard gravell, or any other hard Land whatsoever after it
 comes to be beyond its natural temper, is an excellent good form, &amp; a very
 usefull plow, and very necessary that al great Corn-masters have one of these
 for strength, that so he may not force his other plows which are made on
 purpose for lands in a Tillable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, &amp; so are made more light &amp;
 portable than these will bear to be, but these will go and work well with a
 great strength, when other ploughs will not to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and because much
 addition of ease cannot be given to this plough, which I shall not advise to
 but in the cases aforesaid, when and where other ploughs cannot work, these
 Lands being under an extreme. And as to such extremes, nor none else will any
 ordinary Rule hold, that I may not work against the stream, lest I swim alone;
 I will only give you a short description with the draught or figure therof, and
 as any addition may be given to the plough in any of its members, it shall not
 be restrained from an application to this as wel as to any other.</p>
                  <p>This is usualy drawn with Horses, or Oxen geered dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble two a
 breast and indeed so they draw the strongest but tread the Land the more, but
 why they may not be put single in wet seasons, or in dangerous times, I know
 not.</p>
                  <p>This Wheel-plough is made of a strong clest Ash-beam, about
 six foot long,<note place="margin">Plough-beam.</note> and is contrary to all
 other beams in the Compass of it the crook or compass wherof looketh upwards,
 and the Land-handle thereof is placed at the great or neather end of the beam,
 as other ploughs are for it is usually made with one handle,<note place="margin">Wheel plows described.</note> and the plow-staff is instead of the
 Furrow-handle, and is very long an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the length of the handle, the
 length wherof I much approve, and could wish it were observed in every plough
 whatsoever, it tending much to the easie and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain holding of the
 plough.</p>
                  <p>The Sheath is made of the toughest, youngest Ash, and 
 <pb n="201" facs="tcp:54116:115"/> perfect &amp; dry that can be got,<note place="margin">Plough-sheath</note> and set with a very good mortess very much
 forward, joynted exceeding true and close into the beam, and driven up so
 exceeding hard, with a bragget behind it to hold it from declining, that it
 stands and will to its work in the strongest land whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>The Head is pitched as strongly at the neather end of the
 Sheath and Stilt as can be,<note place="margin">Plough head.</note> and pinned
 through both, and the Share is pitched upon the Head at a very deep pitch and
 somewhat hanging, that so the plough may goe much a shore, because the holder
 usually goes two furrows off the plough wider on the near side the plough: And
 as it is pitched deep, near a full yard pitch, so it is also very broad, being
 near half a yard, and that I conceive arises from the former Reason, because of
 the mans going so far wide of his plough. Their Shares are made exceeding
 narrow, and very strong, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to a very exceeding long small point,
 very well stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and sometimes they add a Tush or Phin, but they make it
 very narrow also, and so it must needs be, the hardness, and stoniness of the
 land not admitting of it: And the Coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stands a little above the
 Share-point, and not before it, but rather behind it.</p>
                  <p>As for the Wheels that bear it,<note place="margin">Plough-wheels</note> being eighteen or twenty inches high, are
 made of about six spokes of wood or iron, fastened into a little short Hub or
 Nath, and a bark hoop or iron binding round about them: they run upon an iron
 Spindle about two foot long: which runs round in a Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster which the iron
 spindle beareth, and it is three or four inches thick, and lieth betwixt the
 wheels about fifteen or sixteen inches in length or more, and at least eighteen
 or twenty inches in height, standing up to bear the plough-beam, &amp; upon the
 same Boulster goes up an Iron pin eight or nine inches above the Beam, and to
 gage it for its true depth; to the middle of which Boulster is fastened a short
 chain backward with a strong iron Coller almost like a round Ring which
 encompasseth the Beam, and is moveable, and to be put forward or backward, to
 make the plough goe deeper or shallower, as occasion is, and is held in its
 place with an Iron Hammer; the helve or shaft all of solid Iron, <pb facs="tcp:54116:116"/>
 
                     <figure/> 
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:54116:116"/> and that is to be taken in or
 out of the beam at pleasure, to let it down or take it up as cause requires:
 and when the plough turns out of work at Lands end, it must have some cord or
 strong whit-leather thong to come up from the boulster, to keep the beam from
 slipping off being empty. And so you have a short verball description of the
 Wheel-plough as it is used in most parts of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Wheel-plough requires a great strength; and the greater
 because of the great length they are made of, which carrieth such a long and
 heavy weight of earth upon it, that it adds exceedinly to the burthen of it,
 which may be easily removed in some measure, by contracting the plough into a
 shorter, and somewhat narrower compass, and taking off as much of the weight
 and load both of Wood and Iron, as the strength of the work will bear upon
 which it is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; yet it being a very useful plough upon some lands
 &amp; at some seasons. The Figure expect with the other ploughs.</p>
                  <p>There is another double Wheeled-plough, &amp; it is called the
 Turn wrest plough,<note place="margin">The Turn-wrest plough.</note> which of all
 ploughs that ever I saw, surpasseth for weight and clumsiness: it is the most
 of use in <hi>Keut, Picardy</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> and is called the
 <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> plough with us.</p>
                  <p>The beam may be made of any wood for the bigness of it, but
 Ash is best: but the two handles are made of one forked peece of any wood, and
 the beam tenanted into the Stlit below the Fork, and so it runs down into the
 plough-head, and is there tenanted and pinned into the head; and as for the
 Sheath, that is a good strong peece of dry Ash tenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the beam,
 directly down right, but looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the neather end, and fixed into
 the Head somewhat as other ploughs are, but the Sheath far bigger downwards:
 the plough-head is pitched at a very great depth, or else at random for depth,
 being carried with two Wheeles as the former, but nothing like so neat nor
 easie; and for bredth, it is pitched just under the Beam upon a straight line,
 and so it ought to be, as you shall see anon. As for any Shield or
 breast-board, it hath none at all on either side the plough, 
 <pb n="204" facs="tcp:54116:117"/> as all other have, but a little peece of wood set along
 the Sheath forward, about five inches broad, closing upon the Share just as if
 you would cut a Die in the midst from corner to corner, and place the flat side
 to the Sheath, and the edge forward, which is their breast-board. The Share is
 put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the plough-head with a pan half round upward, and flat downward, and
 is, or ought to be tushed a little on both sides, as our ordinary ploughs are,
 and so runs out to a sharp point.</p>
                  <p>They have one Wrest or two, some one and no more, but
 sometimes two, which I should conceive alwaies and at all times best; and this
 Wrest is to be put upon pins, one in the Sheath, standing just under the Breast
 board, and the other unto a longer pin or round staff fixed into the bottom of
 the handle, as wide as the furrow, and this Wrest is no other but as a round
 stick about two foot long, or rather a half rovnd one, with two holes in it to
 put the aforesaid pins into; and at every Lands end this Wrest must be turned
 on the other side; so if they have two must they both be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also, and one
 placed two or three inches higher than the other, and the highest is to be
 placed broader by an inch and half, or two inches, and sometimes three inches
 than the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermost to cast the furrow cleanly over.</p>
                  <p>And for the Coulter, that is also moveable in the Coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
 hole, it being made very wide, at every Lands end, to which purpose they have a
 strong ground Oak-plant, about an inch and half over, that is very tough, and
 with that they will, having two pins placed upon the top of the Beam, one an
 equall distance from another, and both equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Coulter, wrest
 or writh the Coulter from one side to another, and there hold it till they come
 to the lands end, and there turn both Wrest and Coulter.</p>
                  <p>And thus you have a rude description of the Turnwrest or
 Kentish plough, and the Figure you should have, would it advantage my Reader
 half so much as it would cost the cutting; but they are so common in
 <hi>Kent</hi> all the Countrey over, and that so near <hi>London,</hi> that I
 had rather when thou hast a mind invite thee thither to see the thing it self 
 <pb n="205" facs="tcp:54116:117"/> which will give thee better satisfaction than all the
 Figures can dot.</p>
                  <p>Yet thus much learn from hence, that the Land that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so
 upon the side of a hill, as there is no plowing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and downward, may
 very well be plowed with this plough, and best of all, and it is especially
 usefull hereto; or it you have any flat levell peece, where you would not have
 one furrow discovered, this will do it also; the formost Horse or Ox alway
 going in the furrow, and the nearest alway upon the Land, and alway double; and
 I am consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it may be cast into a neater form, and made to very good
 advantage; the weightiness and ugliness of it I hate, but the Turnwrest conceit
 I like, which my occasions have not permitted me to experiment, of which I
 shall say no more at present, but that the Turnwrests to cast the furrow is
 very good and usefull for the two sorts of ground above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
                  <p>I shall now come to the one wheeled Plough,<note place="margin">The single wheel plough.</note> and of that I shall give you also
 somewhat a large accompt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is an excellent good one, and you may use
 it upon almost any sort of Lands, which the Figure and descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the
 same, which shallbe drawn into that shape and form that will admit of more
 lightness and nimbleness than any of the former.</p>
                  <p>You may see the use and fashion of it too at Collonell
 <hi>Blunts</hi> near <hi>Greenwitch</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> a Gentleman of great
 e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem and honour in his Country, who hath made very many of them.</p>
                  <p>The main Plough-beam is very short, about five foot long, made
 of very good wood, but small and light as may be, to which is another false
 Beam added below the Coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hole, under the other and fixed to it by a
 staple, drove up into the true Beam, with a capping upon the false beam end, or
 some other way, the form whereof is not much materiall, which false beame is
 that by which the plough is drawn, and gives opportunity by a Standard put into
 the end of it, bored full of holes; and passing through <pb n="206" facs="tcp:54116:118"/>
 the Master-beam, to let the plough up and down to any gage of depth or
 shallowness whatsoever, and indeed that beam is the guide of it.</p>
                  <p>The Sheath is pitched very forward from the beam into the mold
 of the Share whose Share-mold, as I may call it, is made as long as the Head
 should have been, &amp; is of the same use as the plough-head is of, &amp; is
 made of two smal slips, not so heavy as the Head would be, &amp; there being no
 head at all, the Land-handle is put into the Share-mould with an iron pin, and
 so is the plough-sheath also, and there fixed fast with an iron pin, and the
 Share forward made like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theher Share; and then just before the Breast-plate
 is a hole made through the Share, and there is rivetted, or else with an iron
 hook put into a long iron slipe, which is made an inch, or inch and half broad,
 and so comes up to the beam just before the nose of the Shield board, and so
 runs through it, and is cottered upon the top of the Beam lying upon the Shield
 board, and the Shield board is compassed a little hollow in the very breast,
 and so from before the middle, begins to whelm and wind towards the furrow, and
 so winds more and more to the very end, and this Breast-board is placed close
 upon the Share, which is made with a long point, and broad or narrow phin, as
 the land re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; and sometimes, and any time any ordinary <hi>Pan de</hi>
 Share may bee used, and placed upon a Head as other ploughs are; either with a
 narrow point for gravell or stoniness, or with a broader Phin, and long sharp
 point, for mixed, sandy earthy Land, as well as that fashioned Share, and be of
 the same use as I conceive.</p>
                  <p>The Pitch of these Ploughs are about, or above two foot in
 depth, and about eight or nine inches in wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: This alway carefully
 observe that the uprighter you pitch your plough to goe the narrower, and the
 more hanging, the broader. As for the depth, I conceive it is not much
 materiall, because it is born up from the false beam till it come to a true
 working pitch; and in the false beam is planted an Iron Axeltree, about one
 inch or a little more in bigness, and about one foot long nine or ten inches 
 <pb n="207" facs="tcp:54116:118"/> before the end of the false beam, and put in square into
 the beam, that it may stick fast; and at the other end of the Axeltree runs a
 wheel upon it, about eighteen or twenty Inches, or may be a little higher, or
 lower, as you please, which guides the plough from that false beam, that it
 can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sting or draw into the ground, &amp; so is drawn at the end of that
 false beam, either with Horse or Oxen, with Cock or Clevies, as you have
 occasion or do desire; but because this plough cannot be fully discovered by
 the most familiar dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but will require the Figure also I will here give
 ye it, as near to the life as possibles.</p>
                  <p>That which is the Standard, fastned in the lower beam, and
 runs through the over, to gage the plough, is made near two foot high, and in
 the over end is made two holes to put the Horse-raine throngh, to come from the
 Horse head to the very plough handles, to guide him to and fro, and under them
 divers removing holes, and one or two in the beam equall to those in the
 Standard, and an Iron pin put through them both. This plough neatly made, and
 very small hath been drawn with one horse, and held by one man, and plowed one
 Acre a day at sowing time in a moyst season; and as Collonell <hi>Blunt</hi>
 hath related to me, he hath with six good horses six men, and six ploughs,
 plowed six Acres a day at sowing rime, in light well wrought Land.</p>
                  <p>The Figure expect with his fellows.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Shall discover some generall faults that may be
 incident to all sorts of Ploughs, and give you the description of the Dutch and
 Norfolk Ploughs.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shal now proceed in this place, though not so Methodically
 as I should, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the usuall faults of many ploughs of all sorts, and
 most ploughs in <hi>England</hi> are tainted with some of them.</p>
                  <p>1 When they are made too big both of Wood and Iron, that is
 bigger than the work requires, they are the heavier to be drawn, carry the more
 weight with them, and require the more strength to draw them. A husbandman must
 have his severall ploughs if he will carry on his work comfortably.</p>
                  <p>2 Fault may be in the roughness and ill compassendness of the
 Share, as aforesaid; and when a plough is made too thick in the very breast; of
 this fault are many ploughs in some parts, and though it help well in the
 sudden cast of the furrow, and wil carry a great furrow with it, yet it goes
 very sore; of this fault are the plough in <hi>Holland</hi> in
 <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnshire,</hi> which otherwise have a gallant cast of the Shield board
 as I ever saw, which I have before at large descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
                  <p>3 Is the shortness of the handles, by which a man cannot
 command his plough with that ease and truth as he might do if his handle had
 length and compass: A short upwright handle exceedingly dislike, a man having
 very little power to command the same, &amp; when the plough is not truly held
 it never goes easie.</p>
                  <p>4 The straitness of the Breast-board neither made nor drawn
 compass and croswinding for the cast of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <pb n="209" facs="tcp:54116:119"/> a
 very great fault to the Ploughs ease.</p>
                  <p>5 The placing the Wrest even with the Breast-board, and as
 long as it, or near as long, nay I have in some parts seen it longer. It is as
 great a hindrance to the easie and true going of the plough as any I know, and
 yet by very few discerned or reproved; I say, &amp; had I time I would give
 rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons enough to clear it, that a good broad Wrest; and five, six, or seven
 inches shorter than the Shield-board, is best, which being at the further end
 set even, or a little under the breast-board, and at the neather end where it
 is pinned, either to land, handle, or otherwise it be set two inches nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
 and under the Shield-board, is both easie to the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and to the cattle, and
 a main advantage to the turn and strike of the furrow, and especially the
 plough being made no broader behind than a just furrow breadth.</p>
                  <p>6 And lastly the dulness of Irons, and either not clouting at
 all, or else uneven rough clouting and plating your ploughs, is a considerable
 hindrance both to the ease and lasting of
 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ste plough.</p>
                  <p>And these, or any of them all are generalls, and will hold,
 let them be upon what plough they will, or upon what Lands they wil, or in what
 seasons soever, and are greathin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances of the good of plough and Plowing: And
 there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what fashioned ploughs soever you make; take heed of these Rocks,
 and for what seasons soever you make them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd them all, and then if thou
 wilt follow thine own Country fashion doe, and God bless thee with it. I say
 not that these are all the faults, for there are many more, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
 treated of also aforegoing, but these are such as may be prevented in any
 common sort of ploughs whatever, &amp; most of them In al sorts, &amp; wil put
 such an advantage to the ploughs ease, as with observing the foregoing
 directions also will be woth thy imitation.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> are very good ploughs
 in many parts of the Country, &amp; upon the sandy parts two horses &amp; one
 man will plow at ordinary seasons, and almost any land of that sandy nature,
 two Acres of a day, &amp; many times one man with two horses hath plowed three
 Acres in one <pb n="210" facs="tcp:54116:120"/> day: They seldom go with above two horses,
 and may with one horse, and one man; and if they plow any strong land, that
 they are forced to put in three or four, they set them double, and have but one
 man to plough and drive: Their ploughs are very small and light, and little
 compassed, all which are great advantages, but the greatest is the Land, which
 is a pure sand for the most part, and very easie work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing land; yet though this
 be the easiest, yet we have in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred places of this Nation very sandy
 light land, &amp; very earthy mouldy land, a light mixed chissely land, and
 abundance of Errable Land in very good Tilth, where men usually go to plow with
 four horses or four oxen &amp; a horse, and seldom less, but many times more
 (which might as wel if not better be done with two) unless at seed time, now
 and then two oxen and a horse, or three horses and two men, which is a
 wonderfull charge to the poor Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the extremity of which charge were
 it but removed, would be sufficient of it self to make him thrive and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
 I shall conclude this discourse with a relation I had fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a <hi>Norfolk</hi>
 Gentlman of very good worth and credit in that Country. Upon the Marsh-lands
 bordering upon the Sea-coast, a Gentleman set an hundred Acres to a man to
 plow, he covenanted with him to find him horse, and ploughs, &amp; irons and
 meat for the horses, and he was to find onely all mans labour, and he allowed
 him eight horses for the work, and for the mans labour that he was onely to
 find to plow this land: the man covenanted to plow this Marsh-land, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is a
 mixed earth, &amp; we have many thousand Acres as easie plowing in
 <hi>England,</hi> almost in al Countris for 5<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. an Acre, &amp; performed it;
 he plowed his 8 acres a day, he found but 3 men to the work, he went to plow
 with two Teems, two horses and one man to one plough, and two horses and one
 man together in the morning, &amp; one man to shift them at noon, and meat and
 gear them, and then he brought in two Teem in the afternoon, two horses in a
 Teem with the same men, and so plowed, as aforesaid, his eight acres: I saw the
 ground thus plowed, &amp; the poor man got his three shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and four pence
 for his men and himself, that is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence <pb n="211" facs="tcp:54116:120"/> a day a
 man,<note place="margin">A president of land plowed for 5 s. an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre plough and
horses found.</note> which is good wages in <hi>Norfolk.</hi> It is a wonder
 that we should be so slothfull, when some are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious.</p>
                  <p>As for the Dutch plough I have also considered, which
 exceedingly differs from our severall fashioned Ploughs, therefore I shall not
 give you the large description thereof, because as it is the pure Dutch plough,
 it is only applyable to Fen ond Marsh-land, where there is neither stone, nor
 root nor hard place, and the chiefest advantage it hath to east and expedition
 is in the breadth and sharpness of the share which is made about a foot and a
 half broad, some more; and sharp in the point; and as thin in the phin as a
 knife, and wrought most curious: a good share being worth above twenty
 shillings, which casts up a very grear broad Furrow, very clean, and easie as
 is possible, out of which I have contracted as much there-from, in the
 descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Share as I can possibly allow to our uncertain changeable
 Land, to advance the ease which many times alters the temper and strength twice
 or thrice in one land.</p>
                  <p>And then for the Coulter,<note place="margin">The dutch coulter
is appliable to any pure clean land.</note> that is also especially applya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
 to the aforesaid Land, but may be used upon any fair, pure, lay, turf, being
 old pasture. And thus I have given you the description &amp; leave it to thy
 imitation; a good one will cost a mark or fifteen shillings; onely say you can
 hardly have a Smith in the country to work well upon it, and far worse upon the
 share; but as to the bastard Dutch, which is somewhat nearer appliable to our
 Lands, I have taken from it as much as it will afford me both in the cast of
 the Shield-board, which is very good, as also in all the other parts of it, and
 do apply it to the plough hereafter descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; and shall ingeniously
 acknowledge I have some branch from every of these roots, and from the
 <hi>Norfolk</hi> plough, and one wheeled plough also, from all which I find,
 that the shorter and lesser any plough is made,<note place="margin">The onely
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for making the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest going plough.</note> having its true pitch,
 with its true cast on the Shield-board, and short Wrest, and sharp irons, the
 far easier. Of all which having so seriously considered, made and tryed them
 almost every <pb n="212" facs="tcp:54116:121"/> one upon severall sorts of Land, and
 experimented them to the full with my own hands to my great expence, shall
 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend unto my third General head for easing the plough.</p>

 the Plough consists, with the easiest going Plough, and the advantages gained

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not with the least disparagement to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them
 (giving them their due praise and honor) draw forth a description of the most
 easie-going Plough I can, &amp; contract it to the least charge is possible;
 having all these helps and lights; and to add nothing thereto were a shame to
 an ingenious man.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore take a short beam, deeper one way than
 another,<note place="margin">The descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the plain plough.</note> of a
 tough and dry young Ash, betwixt five foot, and six foot long, rising in the
 Coulter-hole, and strong there, but thence declining both wayes for strength,
 and so growing smaller, wrought round and smooth, my Sheath most exactly fitted
 into the beam, and pitched pretty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and driven up so close with a
 little lace or bragget put behind the Sheath into the beam and Sheath, just
 but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at both ends when the Sheath is driven up, which shall stand as a
 Buttress to support it, and may be as serviceable as an Iron dog as many use;
 my nearer Handle put upon a Tennant through the same, and drawn close with two
 or three wooden pins, and then both sheath and handle ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted exceeding
 close into the head, being about two foot long, not standing upright nor level,
 but beam-handle and sheath hanging from a perpendicular point one fifth or 
 <pb n="213" facs="tcp:54116:121"/> sixth part to the Land on the nearer hand; my
 Furrow-handle with two good round staves planted on my Land-handle, as wide in
 the ends as a man can hold them, being very long and wel compassed and fairly
 wrought; my share formerly described pitched true upon my head, and drawn up
 with an iron bolt through head and pan into my beam, and cottered up, my share
 standing rather more hanging than the head doth, so close and true, as that
 water cannot pierce betwixt them either with a Coumb weelded on, rightly
 compassed, laid into my sheild-board, placed as high as the earth works up, and
 as smooth as may be, to the end my breast not being too thick at the nose, nor
 widening too suddenly, and as soon as the earth comes to the middle my
 Shield-board to widen, whelm, or compass, as if it would lie upon the furrow,
 and so to widen and whelm more and more unto the very end; or else a shiner
 planted upon my share, most close wrought, compassed and nayled to the
 sheild-board in the form before prescribed.</p>
                  <p>My Wrest a large hand breadth,<note place="margin">The benefit
of a broad and short Wrest.</note> planted under my sheild-board bottom, and
 narrower than it, and rather yet nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower to the sheild-board end, so that it
 retain the just and full breadth of my furrow and no broader, it both goes
 easier, and helps the cast of the furrow: I desire it be well plated too, but
 shorter by five or six inches than my sheild-board, and by two inches than my
 Plough-head; my whole Plough boarded up so close as no earth may get into it,
 and plated very well and smooth in every wearing place what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soevor: As for the
 pitch both in breadth and depth, that must be resolved both from the height you
 make your Plough, if high in the chest, your pitch must be the deeper about
 eleven or twelve inches, or about ten or eleven and a half; if to go single you
 must pitch it broader, if to go dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble narrower: Every common Plough-wright
 can help you here, &amp; also understand what is here dirrcted; my irons kept
 both hard and sharp in points and Phin, and this plough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once well
 scoured and clean, if it go not with as much ease as nature doth admit, or Art
 hath hitherto discovered, I will acknowledgemy mistake; but what strength may 
 <pb n="214" facs="tcp:54116:122"/> draw it I shall not determine, I have told you what hath
 &amp; doth draw the other ploughs before described, and could you shew me all
 the Lands, and all the temperatures at all seasons of those Lands, I could
 easily demonstrate that, but to me it is s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fficient if that I have both rationally and
 expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimently discovered to thee the best plough &amp; easiest that I know or
 have read of in the world, as I have cordially don, and given thee the product
 of my experience, and from each removed the inconvenience, and drawn out the
 quintessence as I am able. If this plough be preserved from any earth cleaving
 at all to it, bee as little in compass as any, have the advantages of sharp
 irons, and perfect true Workmanship, as that it need no Wheel which is a
 weight, and requires strength, and is of no use but to guide the Pitch, and
 this Pitch be made so true of it self as it will goe without it, and the Wrest
 cut shorter which gives much ease, and makes the plough go more certain, and
 the furrow turn better, and all these are as an addition to it; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and
 know less strength will draw it; to which if you please you may add the Dutch
 Coulter, it going some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what easier, and is best for the pure turf without
 stones, but the other being kept as sharp is more certain, and not subject to
 be cast out of the ground, and will do exceeding well in wrought tillable land,
 if you keepe it a little before the share, that it may cut first, and one
 thought wider also but never within the share: 'Tis true in irreguler extreme
 land either for stones, roots, or hardness, I am at a loss, and for that end
 advise to the double-wheeled plough, which though it will be no otherwise
 advantaged to ease than as it is well and compleatly made, yet it is for
 strength &amp; to supply extremities and cases of necessity without rule.</p>
                  <p>But thus much I will say, that take or make me such a plough,
 aforesaid described, upon any of the aforsaid lands, where the easiest and best
 ploughs are used (which I could wish had bin before now discovered which would
 have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me this labour (and make tryall of it, and as the land is lighter
 and easier so make the plough lighter and lesser, and if it go not easier by a
 considerable part, my judgement <pb n="215" facs="tcp:54116:122"/> fails me;<note place="margin">What ease and advantage this plough and the directions will
afford.</note> I am sure these particulars considered, and solidly put in
 practice throughout this Nation, may very well save one third part of the
 charge and toyle of Horse and man; nay in some parts I am confident neare one
 halfe, and if to the best plough it will give but the least addition, it is
 satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction enough to me; but I very well know, it wil save one horse in
 four, and I believe one in three, as most Countries use, and one man in two.
 All that I have said is but to the pitch, and making the body of the plough. I
 say againe, if any contend for wheel or foot, he need but give his plough a
 little deeper pitch, and he may adde either thereunto, as wel as to any other,
 and please himself. The description of it shal follow in the end of the 33
 Chapter.</p>
                  <p>And if you object, what shal guide the plough for depth, and
 keep it from stinging in clay ground, and how may you let it up and down as the
 nature of your land requires.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, that having both in your plough, and
 plough-irons brought your plough to a true and perfect pitch, it wil require
 but litle help herein, yet hereby you may much answer your desire in two
 particulars.</p>
                  <p>1 In your hindmost gears you may at your chain that is put
 upon your plough-cock, or clevies, which ought to be made short linked on
 purpose to take up or let down as you see occasion.</p>
                  <p>2 Your hindmost, or Fil-horse at the back-band, which may be
 to take up or let down, you may ease your self at plearsue; and so I descend to
 the last General head.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the description whereof I shall in generall say, that when
 lands come to that extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of hardness as the plough is forced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its
 gage or pitch of Truth, and that nothing but force will overcome it, then we
 must be content to lay by our hopes of ease and all our ploughs whatsoever that
 were made upon that account; for it is concluded that all good Husbands will
 take their seasons, which seasons are chiefly for all their Summers crops, in
 Winter when the Land is moyst &amp; workable,<note place="margin">The season of
plowing for summer corn</note> from <hi>November</hi> untill <hi>March,</hi>
 and for all Winter crops the foundation of that work is to be laid in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
 as in the end of <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Ianuary</hi> to fallow as wee call
 it,<note place="margin">The season for plowing for winter corn.</note> al our
 strong coarse lay Turf, when wee may work it wel and clear it up to the bottom,
 which being once wel ploughed in a right season, it will work reasonable well
 in the hardest season the next plowing, and so very well the next, and so
 throughout, when it is compleatly plowed at the first; which first opportunity
 if it be overpassed by too much business or sloth or otherwise makes all the
 rest of our Tilths uncomfortable; every common Husbandman knows these
 things.</p>
                  <p>And for this Tilth, or season of plowing, and these sorts of
 Lands especially being very rough, hilly or banky, your Wheeled-ploughs will
 not work, but will be cast out by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <pb n="217" facs="tcp:54116:123"/> hill: for this
 use I shall advise you to the plain plough made a little stronger than
 ordinary, with a true pitch both for breadth and depth, and because both wheel
 and foot too will cast it out at every hill, and some men cannot hold a plough
 without either; and possibly thy land may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Land, that is, some
 clay, and some sand, and some mould,<note place="margin">A foot descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as
will go in hilla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> each of which will alter the going of the
 plough, therefore in this case let an iron foot be made, with a sharp edge like
 a Coulter forward to the bottom of the shank, &amp; the foot made flattish, and
 very thin at both edges, and a little stronger in the middle, rising like a
 Place fish, and no thicker, and that will cut your hils before your Coulter,
 and keep it out of the ground too from stinging or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the clayes;
 but yet a good Plough-holder with a good Plough, will cast this away also in
 the roughest lands, and meerly with this hinder chain, &amp; backband of his
 hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most horse take it up at pleasure, and even play with it too in the
 strongest workable work, when another shall moyl himself like a Beast, as we
 say.</p>
                  <p>But to hasten, when by a drought you are out of work, then I
 say as afore, that with strength your wheeled-plough will doe exceeding well,
 and none like it, your double wheeled one I mean, and your single wheeled
 ploughs too being exceeding strongly made, will tear up any reasonable ground,
 but in regard the wheel goes but upon an Axeltree, and that is fixed but in one
 end, in the false beam end also, it cannot be so strong as the other by far,
 therefore I advise every good Husband to one of these, the body of whose plough
 may be made to the same advantages heretofore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
                  <p>As for the casting down a land,<note place="margin">A plow to
cast down land.</note> or plowing any flat land, almost any plough wil doe
 well, and so your broad-breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ploughs will turn over a great furrow, though
 your Shield-board have little compass; but as to the setting up a Land, or
 ridging it, as most call it. I would have a narrow brested plough,<note place="margin">A plow to set up land.</note> with an exceeding whelming compassed
 Shield-board, increasing both in the breast by small degrees, and in the
 compass of the Shield-board with a very broad <pb n="218" facs="tcp:54116:124"/> and short
 Wrest, which adds one or two degrees of cast or compass to the Shield board;
 for in this work you will most apparently see the ease and advantage
 thereof</p>
                  <p>The Coulter having first done his office by going before,<note place="margin">The particular use of many of the members of the wel regulated
plough.</note> and dividing out the furrow.</p>
                  <p>The Share his, in cutting it up clear, and raising it from the
 solid Land.</p>
                  <p>The breast of the Shield-board takes it and gives it a cast
 and turn, that it is ready to fall.</p>
                  <p>The Wrest keeps its furrows breadth (for the horses easie
 going) and not suffer the furrow to drop short of its true place, but least it
 should stand an edge.</p>
                  <p>The Heel, or hinder end of the Shield-board comes, being
 longer than the Wrest, and standing as it were overlooking to see what it will
 leave, and like a Ladies tryal, gives the Furrow a sweep, or a good check, and
 bids it lye there in its proper place and not stand upon the edge.</p>
                  <p>And thus each member having done his office, one taking it
 from another regularly must needs admit of the greatest ease. A Saddle-tree is
 made of many peeces, and some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass one way and some another but all to the
 true compass and easiness of the horse-back, so a plough it might be made of
 fewer parts and lesser compass, but that sewer will not give the true compass
 or cast of it, and deliver his furrow upon the best advantage.</p>
                  <p>As for your ordinary seasons of plowing your Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in
 good Tillage,<note place="margin">How to plow as it may yeild most mould.</note>
 any well ordered, and truly compassed plough will do, you may help your self
 sufficiently in the making of your irons, if you would have the edge of your
 lying furrow lye up higher, which will yeeld most mould, then set your
 Share-phin the shallower, and set your plough the broader, and hold it the more
 ashore, the Plough-man going upon the Land, and it will lay it with a sharp
 edge, which is a gallant posture for almost any Land, especially for the lay
 Turf beyond compare.</p>
                  <p>But if you would have you land lie most even and flat,<note place="margin">How to plow as your lay your land most level.</note> then set the
 Phin of your Share deeper, or holding, as some call it, &amp; set your plough
 the narrower, &amp; the holder alway <pb n="219" facs="tcp:54116:124"/> alway going in the
 furrow, and the Shield-board end will so humble it, as you may lay it upon a
 levell; this is best for land of which you will make a fallow, or cut and burn
 the Turf, or for land you intend to lay flat to grase. If the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row should be
 all at once turned at the very breast, then it would go just as if you would
 put a Mold to root with her breech forward; which plough I have seen, but how
 the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row would lie I know not, nor well what strength to draw it; but then
 there need neither be use of the hinder part of the Shield-board, nor Wrest
 neither; or if you would have it cast all in the Shield-board as some do that
 make no Wrest at all, then it will either not clear up the furrow well, set the
 furrow upon an edge, or else the hinder end of the sheild board, must whelm
 beyond all president or rule; or if you would have it made so thin in the
 breast as to cut through like a knife, and turn nothing till it come to the
 midst of the Shield-board and end of the Wrest and Shield-board, then there it
 gives too sudden a check too, and causeth the earth to choak and mouther upon
 the Breast board, that it will not slip away with ease; so that as I said
 before a medium in all, each member doing its particular office, preserves the
 health and comfort of the body.</p>
                  <p>These things (and many more which might be ncessary, I will
 forbear to speak to) are accounted niceties among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the knowledge whereof
 hath cost me much, and therefore am able to affirm that the very mystery of
 Ploughmanship lyeth upon the knowledge and practice of them, and so I proceed
 to the double plough, and the description thereof.</p>

 carrying two Fuorows at once, and both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to a Furrow one ordinary

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He double plough shall be as plain as may be, it shall
 consist of one long Beam of an ordinary length, and another short one, little
 above half the length of the other. The first plough may be made up compleat in
 all the members thereof according to the last preceding description of the
 plain plough except the handles which may be very short, only so long as may
 receive the Beam with the Land-handle, and place the Shield-board on the furrow
 side, which may be done without any but a round staff from the Beam to the
 Shield-board; which handles excepted, it is one compleat plough in all
 particulars. The hinder end of the Beam is to be left a little stronger,
 because of fastening the other beam firmly thereunto; and then I proceed to the
 making of the hindermost Plough, which must be made in all the members and
 branches like the other, except the beam cutt off about three inches before the
 Coulter-hole, and the handles of this at length and strength as an ordinary
 strong plough is made, just according to the pattern of the plain plough.</p>
                  <p>Which being done, and the handles upon the last plough, you
 must set to the placing of it in his place which I disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thus, the first
 plough standing in its working posture, the other plough with is the handles to
 it to be affixed on the <pb n="221" facs="tcp:54116:125"/> nearer side, or left-hand, one
 furrow breadth wider than the other, just in the very same posture both for
 depth and breadth as the other doth, and so held off: from the first ploughs
 beam by alining, or filling of wood just that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as may continue it
 firm and fast to a just furrow, and there drawn close and firm to that
 Master-beam with two small iron boults,<note place="margin">How to set the double
plough together.</note> and a broad float or two of wood, all which may be so
 keyed and cramped up, that it may be as one solid beam, and so move as the
 first moves, either for height or depth, which it must needs do, and this I
 conceive may be best used with a plough-foot to guide the depth of it, unless
 you place a wheel to that foremost beam, but not in a false beam, because I
 have not experience of applying this doubleness to those deep pitched ploughs,
 but in the end of that beam you may have as good a mortess as your beam will
 bear, which is the mortess for the foot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may place a square
 good strong piece of tough Ash, or rather of iron, into which you may have your
 iron Axel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree with its square end sitted into three or four severall holes of
 it, by which means you may set your plough at a working gage, and there
 continue it, and alter it as you see cause; which plough thus marshalled, you
 may well plow upon ordinary errable land that is in good tillage a double
 proportion, and also upon fair clean lay Turf, and this you may manage with two
 men and four good horses, but not either upon stony land, or rough land, the
 description and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course wherof I give not in as of any great advantage above
 the other plain plough, but for variety sake, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok others to the
 amendment and perfecting of this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; yet I for present see not, but it
 may be of excellent use &amp; expedition upon many lands in <hi>England;</hi>
 and to say much more is needless, in regard of what hath been before spoken and
 experience of a good ploughman will order it at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p>And so I shall onely discover one other plough that will both
 plow and harrow of it self at one and the same time,<note place="margin">The

 casting about with my self the advantages and disadvantages also, 
 <pb n="222" facs="tcp:54116:126"/> and finding not how it will so well suit with our common
 wayes of Husbandry as to be a general advantage, I shall say the less, only
 tell you the manner of it, It is a common light Plough as all theirs are, and
 as little and light a Harrow, which may contain three little Buls, &amp; about
 five Tines in a bull, which is made light also, and fixed to the plough at the
 one end of the beam, so that as the plough turns this turns also, and as the
 plough turns one furrow, the harrow harrows it over, reaching two more furrows,
 and so by the over-reaching it strikes two or three times in one place, which
 is sufficient for the covering any corn whatsoever shal be sowen upon
 <hi>Norfolk</hi> lands; but finding these two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices against it,
 <hi>viz,</hi> either this land must be sowed as the land is plowed, &amp; so it
 will take up a mans time sowing an Acre, when otherwise a man will sow nine or
 ten Acres in one day, or else it must be sowed before plowing, and then it must
 be plowed in, and harrowed upon the top of it, which falls not under my
 experience, having known much land <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 is; and may be done, may thy own experience be the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner of the matter,
 but after the writing hereof having communicated thus much to a Gentleman of
 art and worth, do find that another addition may be made thereto, which is how
 to drop the corn, corn by corn proportionably to that quantity I desire to sow
 upon an Acre,<note place="margin">Plough har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, seedsman, and all in one

 not to give you plough, and harrow, and seedsman all at once, and all to work
 with two horses and one man upon some lands, and with three horses upon all of
 this nature, &amp; al to be done almost within the same compass of time that
 you are upon the plowing of it, it shall not require one hour in the day more;
 w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if I shal accomplish, you shall save near three parts of your seed also,
 and a considerable peece of labour too and not fail to have a better crop
 through the blessing of him that waters all, than ordinary wise. All which I
 hope to have brought into substantiall experience upon my own 
 <pb n="223" facs="tcp:54116:126"/> lands by the next edition, and then expect the faithfull
 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication thereof. One word more which would have come in more seasonable
 about the description of the plain plough, and that is how to make a plough
 that may last ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years ten or twelve, or fifteen years, yea I heard a
 work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affirm he would make one should last twenty years: As for the manner
 of the plow it is sufficiently spoken to alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, all lyeth in two things: one
 thing is the wood it is to be made of, and the other is the workmanship of
 it.</p>
                  <p>The wood, especiall of the Sheath and plough-head, which is
 the materiall fundamentall peece in the Plough,<note place="margin">The lasting
plough that may endure many yeares,</note> must be made of heart of Oak, which
 to me at first seemed strange, but upon a full debate of the matter I find that
 if it be young tough Oak, &amp; wrought so exact true in the joynts as may be,
 &amp; kept so close boarded up as that water cannot get into any of them, and
 laid alway dry, and so kept, but while in working, and every part of it well
 clouted &amp; plated with iron, and drawn close in the throat from a hole in
 the Share, through the Head &amp; part of the Breast-board with a through iron
 pin which is to be wrought somewhat bigger under the head, that so it may
 somewhat strain the share to a more perfect closure, and stronger sticking to
 the head and wel cottered up through the beam, being bored with a long shanked
 Auger through al: And al the rest of the wood to be young white tough Ash, and
 wrought compleat and true in every joynt, &amp; laid up when out of use, both
 out of wind &amp; weather, &amp; out of question a good plough may well serve a
 mans uncertain life: and so having as I hope, in some good measure supplied
 that deficiency in Husbandry Mr. <hi>Hartlips</hi> Legacy chargeth us withall
 in the fifth page of his Book, and so proceed to the next peece of

 places growth of it self, in, and about villages and towns, and is of a very
 great use, and considering the easie charge of the raising of it, and the
 badness of the land upon which it will grow is of incomparable advantage.</p>
                  <p>For first it will grow of very indifferent land, not worth

 that Husbandry without any other addition, unless you draw a bush over it, or a
 role, either of which is sufficient to cover it after you have sowed it, the
 difficultest peece in the managing hereof is the very sowing of it, that is,
 that it may be sowed even; for the seed being so very small, will require both
 skill and an even hand to scatter it; some sow it by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it with one finger
 and the thumb, others with the two fore-fingers and the thumb, but neither of
 these do I affect the best way, because they cannot spread it so well as they
 may with their whole hand, I therefore prescribe a mixture with Ashes, Lime,
 fine earth or some such thing as will best suit with the weight of the seed;
 for could you find out that, that agreed both in weight and bigness, then out
 of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion none to that to sow it withall.</p>
                  <p>A gallon of this seed will sow an Acre,<note place="margin">How
much soweth au acre</note> which had need to every quart of seed have two
 gallous of some of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and it must be often stirred together lest
 that the seed sink to the bottom, and sow that part thicker than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
 and then cast it out at arms end at as good and even compass as you can
 possibly.</p>
                  <p>This seed thus sowed may grow up among the Corn, and yet be no
 prejudice, because it groweth not fast the first Summer; but after the Corn is
 cut it must be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>And the next Summer you shall receive through Gods blessing a
 comfortable crop; you must be exceedingly curious of the ripening of it, if yon
 let it grow too long, your seed will fall out, if not long enough, your seed
 will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, nor your stalk neither; and therefore observe both the
 turning of the seed,<note place="margin">When ripe.</note> and the ripenining of
 the stalk; for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tel you which of either will admit of a dispensation,
 and as soon as ever you perceive it near up to perfect ripeness, you must down
 with it, that is, pull it as you do Flax up by the roots, and bind it in little
 hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

 little stilches or stitches, untill both seed and stalk be both dry, and then
 carried away carefully as that the seed be not lost, and laid up dry, and so
 keep as you see cause for a good <pb n="226" facs="tcp:54116:128"/> market; for it is to be
 sold for the Dyars use, who sometimes will give a very good price,<note place="margin">How to use it</note> but at all times sufficient profit, and go
 far to buy it, from forty shillings an Acre, to ten or twelve pound an Acre,
 some say more. And you may barn it up, and keep it and the seed together untill
 <hi>March</hi> and then you may get out this seed by lashing or whipping of it
 forth upon a board or door, which reserve for seed; the seed is of good value,
 sometimes worth twenty shillings a bushell, and sometime ten shillings a
 bashell, and sometimes more or less as markets rise and fall.</p>
                  <p>It coloureth the bright yellow and the Lemon colour; The stalk
 and root are both useful, and must go together to the Dyar.</p>

 pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, if it prove worth but forty shillings <hi>per</hi> Acre, the land
 being not worth above five shillings or six shillings &amp; eight pence as
 either of these will do exceeding well, the charges of sowing, and all things
 till you come to pulling it, is not above one shilling <hi>per</hi> Acre; the
 pulling, whipping and barning may come to four shillings more; the seed may be
 worth half a crown, so that all charges and rent of the land may amount unto
 less, but I will say fifteen shillings, then the Improvement will be fourfold
 if worth four pound ten shillings an Acre, fixsold, if worth six pound
 <hi>per</hi> acre, eight fold, and much more as some affirm to sixteenfold
 Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>This Land though it lie far from Towns, Cities, yea in your
 remotest Countries may be brought to this height of Improvement, and it begins
 much to spread and thrives ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well in <hi>Kent</hi> in many parts of it; the
 best place for to get the seed is in <hi>Kent</hi> clean down to
 <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Wy,</hi> where you may see both the land, the
 growth and discover the mystery therof. It is sold by weight so much a hundred,
 and so much a tun weight. It is my desire to make publique whatever comes under
 my experience, yet this hath been used this many years by many private
 Gentlemen in divers parts but not discovered for publique practice, but no
 marvell, for <pb n="227" facs="tcp:54116:128"/> that great business of planting Hops, that
 is one of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous peeces of our Nation, hath not any thing been wrote near
 this fourscore years that I can read of, and indeed then was wrote a large
 discourse thereof but I remember not his name, or else I should have here
 raised up his memorial, having done exceeding well thereon, but that all this
 time of so large experience, none should get upon his shoulders, and a little
 add to his beginnings, is the unthankfulness and shame of your great
 Hop-masters. I fear mens spirits are strangely private that have made excellent
 experiments, and yet will not communicate; surely me-thinks plenty and publique
 fulness should not be so much feared as rejoyced in. And so I hope in this I
 have in some measure supplyed my promise.</p>

 long, like little blackish tongues. The root is white and simple. It is a very
 choyce seed to grow and thrive well; it beareth a yellow flower, 
 <pb n="228" facs="tcp:54116:129"/> and requires very rich land, and very sound and warm, so
 that very warm earth, either a little gravellish or sandish will doe exceeding
 well, but the purer warmer solid earth is best: Land exceeding rich, and though
 it should be mixed with a little clay will do well,<note place="margin">The best
Land for Woad.</note> but it must be very warm. There is not much land fit for
 this design in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, especially your hardest Wood-land parts you
 have in many of your great, deep, rich pastures, many hils and hill sides good
 Woad-ground, when the bottom ground will doeno service but your chifest is your
 home-corse, or lesser ground lying near and bordering about the towns.</p>
                  <p>Your best and naturallest parts of <hi>England</hi> for Woad,
 are some part of <hi>Worcestershire,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pest known parts

 <hi>Rutland, Bedfordshire,</hi> and <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> and some other
 places here and there, all these parts have some admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Woad-land in
 them.</p>
                  <p>But when it is a quick commodity, as now it is dull, they will
 find as much more land as now they will, and then more indifferent, dry, sound,
 warm land will serve, but very dry and sound it must be, and worth about twenty
 shillings an Acre to grase at least, or else it will not bee worth the
 Woading.</p>
                  <p>And to plow to sow Woad it may be worth as much more as to
 grase,<note place="margin">What price men will give for good Woad-land.</note>
 yea somewhat more if it be extraordinary rich soyl, and trading good, but now
 as the seasons are, and trading stands, they will now make great orts of land,
 and not bid any money for that which in good trading times they would have gone
 fifty miles to have took at great rates.</p>
                  <p>And wheras some write that it undoeth the land, I answer as I
 judge in my own breast, that in regard it is so often cut and groweth so thick,
 and is so often weeding, that it must needs do so, as I beleeve al Corn doth
 draw forth some of the spirit therof, but no more than other Grain would if it
 could be so oft cut up to grow again.</p>
                  <p>But it is the confidence of many Woad-men that will maintain
 against any man that it betters the land and mends <pb n="229" facs="tcp:54116:129"/> it,
 but to that I cannot accord neither, but thus much I doe say, it prepares the
 Land exceedingly for corn,<note place="margin">Woad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well for
Corn,</note> and doth a bate of the strength and superrichness, or rankness
 thereof, which corn would not wel endure, for I maintain still that the richest
 Land is not best to corn, for though the one may ouer-burthen and be so
 rank,<note place="margin">The best Corn.</note> yet the other may bear as much to

                  <p>Very much may be spoke to this particular, but I must shorten
 and will as much as may be, and acquaint you with the use thereof. And herein I
 must do these three or four things.</p>
                  <p>1. Shew you how the Land must be prepared and sowed.</p>
                  <p>2. Shew you how it must be ordered, when the leaf must be cut,
 and how ordered after cutting.</p>
                  <p>3. And lastly, how it must be tempered and seasoned to make
 the best Woad for use and profit; but before I proceed I must inform my Reader
 that this commodity can not be played withall, as you may doe with Liquorish,
 and Saffron, &amp;c. to make experiments of a little parcell, but a man must of
 necessity set forth, and forward so much stock and Land, and seed, as may keep
 one Mill or two at work to make it into perfect Woad; It is the doing of a
 great quantity, and carrying on a great stock that makes this work, and will
 carry it on to profit and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: Some have as much underhand, and will work
 six or eight Mills. The charge of it is exceeding great in the mannagement of

 done, then cover it, and harrow it very well and fine, and pick of al the
 Clots, Turvees and stones, and lay in the hollow places of the ridge on heapes
 as is the usuall custom, but now I should rather (if there be no other reason
 than I conceive (chuse to take a little Cart with one horse, and as the boyes
 or children pick them up, cast them into the Cart, and carry, them into some
 flank or hollow place and lay them down to rot, or else mend some barren place,
 because they lose a good considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of Land and so of Oad too, which
 otherwise might be as good as the rest, and is now worth nothing; the Land that
 is lost is very considerable in regard it is so goood of it self, and the stock
 so good and rich that is sowed upon it, that all even ground had need be
 regained that possibly may be. And so I descend to the second particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                  <p>2. Which is to shew how it is to be husbandried, and when the
 leaf must be cut, and how used, and how oft, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>After the Land is sowed and it begins to come up, as soon as
 any weed appears it must be weedded, yea may be twice weeded or more if it
 require before it be ready to cut, but if it be speciall good, and come thick
 and cover the ground well,<note place="margin">What is costs an Acre
wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> it will ask the less weeding; to them that are exercised in
 this service, and have their work and work folks at command, they will have it
 weeded for eight pence an acre, and sometime less: as soon as the leaf is come
 to its full growth, which will be sometime sooner, sometime later, as the year
 is dryer or moister, more fruitfull or less, which when you perceive at the
 full ripeness set to cutting of it.</p>
                  <p>As soon as ever it is cut, you Mills being prepared, and great
 broad fleakes so many as may receive one Crop prepared, and planted upon
 galleries or stories made with poles, Fir, alder, or other wood whatsoever;
 your Mill is usually known, a large Wheel both in height, and bredth, and weigh
 doth the best, it is a double wheel, and the <pb n="231" facs="tcp:54116:130"/> Tooth or
 ribs that cut the Woad, are placed from one side of the Wheel to the other very
 thick, wrought sharp and keen at the Edge, and as soon as the Woad is cut and
 comes out of the field, it is to be put into the Mill, and ground one kilnfull
 after another as fast as may be; the joyce of the leaf must be preserved in it
 and not lost by any means,<note place="margin">The joyce of the Woad must by
care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> and when it is ground it is to be made in balls
 round, about the bigness of a ball without any composition at all, and then
 presently laid one by one upon the fleakes to dry, and as soon as dryed, which
 will be sooner or later as the season is, they are to be taken down, and laid
 together, and more put in their places; but because all Circumstances will be
 too tedious to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, &amp; the work is a common work and very many wel
 versed therein, I will rather advise my Reader to get a workman from the
 Woad-works which can carry it on artificially, then venture the experimenting
 of so great a work upon words and rules, and therefore I shall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
 brief,<note place="margin">Five or six Crops in one year of Woad.</note> and let
 you know that good Woad may yield in a very good year five or possibly six
 crops, yea ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily four and yet sometimes but three, but the Winter crop is
 of good worth, excellent for sheep, conceived good against the rot, or will
 recover a rotten sheep, and also it will maintain them well, and though at
 first they will not much affect it yet with a little patience in holding them
 thereto, they will take to it most perfectly and that with love,<note place="margin">Season for sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing VVoad.</note> and it will continue them in good
 heart, &amp; strength, till sowing time again. The time of sowing is in the
 mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and end of <hi>March.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus when you have cut all your crops one after another
 till the Autum or declining season will not ripen it again, and your mill is at
 leasure, then you must proceed to the third particular.</p>
                  <p>Which is to the ordering and seasoning of it, and working it
 up to use, which must be done the manner following, you must set your mils to
 work again, to grind it all over again, and then season it up, and so you may
 make it stronger and weaker as you see occasion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:54116:131"/>There is so much difference betwixt Woad
 and Woad, that the Buyers though so experimentall will hardly buy you any
 parcell untill they have experimented it in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring; And therefore for me to
 prescribe a Rule upon such uncertainties I hold it not safe: The Woad-man will
 make you up three or four sorts of Woad, according as he intends to friend a
 Customer.</p>
                  <p>A word or two more, as to the seasoning of Woad, and but very
 few, because the very first years tryall wil put you into sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
 experience. As the Woad yeelds many Crops, so each Crop is worse than other,
 the first Crop is best, and the second next, and the third much worse, and the
 fourth far worse than that, &amp; the fifth worst of all; if you get a fift but
 that is not usuall, four Crops is sufficient, &amp; sometime you must be
 content with three, &amp; as the first Crop is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (in a good kind year)
 ripe by the midd'st of <hi>Iune,</hi> so wil the second be usually ripe within
 one month after that, and so every month or thereabouts each Crop will be
 rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp; if the latter end of the year prove kind, then you may expect a
 Crop the more.</p>
                  <p>Now to know when the Woad is ripe,<note place="margin">When Woad
is ripe.</note> and to take it in the very season, is a fundamental peece,
 which is when the leaf is come to a full growth, and retaines it perfect color
 and lively greenness, then with all your might set so many hands to cutting of
 it, as that it begin not to fade or wax pale or wan before you have cut your
 crop, for then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be over-ripe, and the sap and marrow of it drinks
 in again and will not yeeld store of juyce, which is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of it and best
 of Woad.</p>
                  <p>The Woad-man seasons the two first Crops together, &amp; some
 season the third by it self, and the fourth by it self, and some put the three
 first Crops together, which makes the worser Woad, but the very virgin Woad is
 the first &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the better they desire to make it, the more intire
 they compound it, not confounding it with divers sorts.</p>
                  <p>The manner of seasoning is thus,<note place="margin">The best
Woad for use.</note> after every crop is cut, &amp; grinded, balled and dryed,
 as dry as can possibly, and laid <pb n="237" facs="tcp:54116:131"/> up in the ball every
 crop by it self, then you must take the first &amp; second Crops and grind them
 all over again toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or apart if you please, but they must be then wrought
 to dust as it were in the mill, &amp; ground very well the first &amp; second
 Crop, or so much as you will make of your best sort of Woad, and so laid upon a
 floor in a heat or couch, and then you must mix it with water, and turn it
 over,<note place="margin">The way of seasonidg Woad.</note> and so mix it again,
 and turn it over, and give it so much water as that it be all soaked throughly,
 however you may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soke &amp; drown it, and that is very prejudiciall to it,
 it must be turned in the couch every day once for three or four weeks together,
 and then every other day once for about a fortnight, and then twice a week till
 it be come to a right temper, at the first many men must be imployed carrying
 water as hard as they can till it be all of it wet &amp; well soak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that

 possibly abide your hand in it, but not to exceed that heat; &amp; how to know
 its seasons kindly, &amp; so wil in time come to perfect rich Woad you must
 observe that it will alter and change divers times, first it wil mould, hoar

 therof and grow toward a black colour, and then it will hoar or mould again,
 and change a little whitish, and after this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond change it will come to a
 perfect black, which the brighter &amp; clearer colour the better; This must be
 the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters work, and it will be good for cold weather, and when it is thus
 wrought &amp; comes to its colour, then you may lay it up, or heap it up, to
 lye for a sale, putting divers poles into each heap to the bottom to open it,
 &amp; keep it cool, &amp; you must be sure it take not heat again; and thus all

 could name divers things which some preserve as rich Treasure in their brains
 and will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, yet this I shall affirm, that this being a

 abate the market, Our dying trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supplyied herewith from beyond the

 and fitted to the dyars use, and so be a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to our selves within our

 especially, it imploying so many hands as will be to bring it to perfection: It
 is like to prove a staple com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and will turn land to as great an advance
 as any seed or root that it is capeable to receive, and need no more fear want
 of markets for the venting of it, than wee need for wooll that staple commodity
 of the Nation. And because the discovery thereof is a matter of so great
 Importance, I shall spend a little more time in the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the whole
 frame hereof.</p>
                  <p>And I shall proceed to the description of it.</p>
                  <p>There is bute on kind of Madder which is manured and 
 <pb n="236" facs="tcp:54116:133"/> set for use,<note place="margin">The descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
Madder.</note> but there is many things like thereto, as Goose-grass, soft
 Cliver, Ladies Bedshaw, Woodroof and Croswort, all which are like to Madder
 leaves, and are thought to be a wild kinds thereof; It hath long stalks or
 trayling branches dispersed upon the ground; rough and full of joynts, and
 every joint set with green rough leaves in manner of a Star. The flowers grow
 at top of the branches, of a faint yellow colour, after which comes the seed,
 round and green. The root creepeth far abroad within the upper crust of the
 Earth, intangling one root into another, and when it is green and fresh, the
 root is of a reddish colour, it is small and tender, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and runs in
 the ground just like an Ivy along a House or Tree. It is a commodity of much
 value Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees strove hard for it, and Patents were gained about it in the
 late Kings daies, and yet now in these times of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom who pursues it?</p>
                  <p>For the making out a good Plantation hereof, I must do these
 three or four things.</p>
                  <p>1. Shew you what it comes of, and how to plant it and preserve
 it.</p>
                  <p>2. How to get it and use it, to bring it to saleable
 Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>3. The benefit and advantage nationall and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
                  <p>Although it bear a seed, yet that seed comes not to perfection
 here, it is therefore to be planted of the sets that are to be gotten from the
 Madder it self, and they are be bought in many gardens in <hi>London,</hi> who
 keep up that Plantation for the advantage of selling their sets and roots
 Physically to the Apothecaries onely, all the skill is to distinguish of the
 goodness thereof: And for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery thereof,<note place="margin">The seasons
of drawing the sets.</note> first know the season of getting or rather drawing
 them, which is in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>Aprill,</hi> yea as soon as they are
 sprung forth of the ground two or three inches long, then you must be carefull
 you get sets roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Every set having some suckors or spinies of root going
 out from them, they must be slipped from the main <pb n="233" facs="tcp:54116:133"/> root,
 and these sets as soon as ever took up, put into some basket with a little
 mould, and posted to the place where they are to be set, the sooner the better;
 and then your ground being very rich it cannot be too rich for this
 commodity,<note place="margin">What ground is best, and how to prepare it.</note>
 however it must be a warm and very deep soil, and digged two or three spade
 graft depth, and two shovellings also, and raked and laid even and levell, and
 then by streight lines trode out into long beds about four foot broad from one
 end of your work into the other, and set about one foot asunder every way, and
 if it be a dry spring they must be kept with watering untill they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
 their fading wan condition; you may begin to dig your ground in the beginning,
 so all along Winter till the very day of setting, and then you must keep it
 with weeding and hoing till it have got the mastership of the weeds and then it
 being a weed of it self wil destroy all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>One rod of ground is worth seaven pence a rod dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">A rod of ground what worth setting.</note> or if very dry strong
 ground, eight pence, but six pence the best ground will require, and you may
 sow some early sallet Herbs, or Reddish, or Onions, or such things as will be

 unto it, and in your setting of them by a line,<note place="margin">At what

 case any dye you must plant new in the room of what decayes, for the time of
 the growing of it untill it come to perfection is three yeares, the first yeare
 you may take off some few sets here and there, but that is somewhat dangerous,
 but that year it must be kept with hoing a while also, and then the second year
 you may take up sets as fast as you will,<note place="margin">When to get sets of
our own planting.</note> and almost as many as you wil; leaving but as you do
 in the croping of an Oak one bough for the drawing up the sap out of the root
 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so thick and strong in the ground that nothing will decay it almost; if
 thou hast but a reasonable quantity, <pb n="238" facs="tcp:54116:134"/> then thou must get
 it for the use of the drugsters and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries, and the sets to plant again,
 and then in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of every root there will be one runner which hath
 little buds upon it, the which may be divided and cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fingers length,
 each so planted with one bud out of the ground set upright, which makes very
 excellent good sets, one runner will make many sets, but these sets can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be
 got up untill the Madder be taken away: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus preserved it untill it
 come to a good crop, if thou intendest it, and hast a quantity sufficient to
 set up a Madder Mill; having curiously dryed it as you do your hopps to a just
 &amp; perfect gage of drought; Thou must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide all materials to that
 purpose; the Mill I cannot well describe, and it is exceeding curious to be
 made aright, &amp; I do not hear of any one can do it, yet possibly there may
 be some Engineer or some Dutch man here that can do it; it being a common Mill
 in <hi>Holland</hi> and the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which is the only place for Madder
 that I hear of in the World. A rude discovery I could give, but I wil forbear
 least any one taking pattern by it should abuse himself more and me in some
 measure, yet here is the mystery of it; so to pare of the husk that it may be
 if possible (as the wheat is ground beflaked or flayed that it may go all one
 way, which sort they call the mull Madder and is little worth, not above nine
 or ten shillings a hundred, and then you must take out the second sort called
 the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber O, which is the middle rind, and is not worth so much as the third
 sort called the Crop madder, by one sixth part, and this crop Madder is the
 very heart and pitch of it inclining to the yellow, and this lesser in quantity
 but better in quality by far. Sometimes the best Madder is worth eight or nine
 pound a hundred, and the number O is worth but six pound six shillings 8 pence
 or eight pound two shillings fix pence, and sometimes, it is not worth above
 four pound or five pound a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, yea sometime it may come to three pound
 the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred possibly, because I would not abuse the Reader, I advise my
 Madder-Planter to send over for a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <pb n="239" facs="tcp:54116:134"/> thence, who
 can both describe the Engine, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of mixing &amp; sorting of it,
 which is the greatest mystery, and well worth your labour and pains it wil
 be.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Barn-Elms</hi> was once Madder sowen &amp; brought to

                  <p>Which is sufficient proof to me that we may raise &amp; make

                  <p>The profit I shall not determine, because it will be long
 before a thorough tryall can be made of it, but now as it is planted in Gardens
 unspeakable advantages are made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and should it hold that proportion

 Parliament of <hi>England</hi> against two Anusancies, or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
 commodities were likely to come into great use and esteem, and that was
 <hi>Newcastle</hi>-coal, in regard of their stench, &amp;c. and Hops in regard
 they would spoyl the tast of drink, and endanger the people, and for some other
 reasons I do not well remember, but petition they did to suppress them, and had
 the Parliament been no wiser than they, we had been in a measure pined, and in
 a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure starved, which is just answerable to the Principles of those
 men that now cry down all devices or ingenious discoveries, as projects, &amp;
 so this day therby stifle, &amp; choak Improvement; yet we see what nationall
 advantages they have since yeelded and no less will many of the other.</p>
                  <p>This Hop plantation would require a large discourse, but I
 shall contract my self to the briefest discovery therof I can possible, &amp;
 therefore shall under three or four Heads,</p>

                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:54116:135"/>I shall describe it thus, it comes up
 with severall sprouts like Sparrowgrass, runs up &amp; climbs on an thing it
 meets withall, bears long stalk., hairy, and rugged leaves, broad like the
 Vine, the flowers hang down by cushers, set as it were with scales yellowish,
 called in high Dutch <hi>Lupulus</hi> in Low Dutch <hi>Hopssem,</hi> and in
 English Hop. It is offensive upon this score, hot in the first degree, stuffs
 the head with the smell, therefore use it not too much, yet the leaves open
 &amp; clense.</p>
                  <p>1 The best land is your richest land, and in time you must
 gain therein, lest another reap the benefit of your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                  <p>It must be a deep mould, that which lyeth near the Rock, the
 Poles cannot be set deep enough to stand firm;<note place="margin">Best
Hop-land.</note> it would be a mixed earth that is compounded of sand and a
 little clay, but much solid earth; a strongish land laid dry and warm will bare
 the most weightiest Hops.</p>
                  <p>A barren, morish wet soyl, is not natural to the Hops
 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, but if this be laid very dry and made very rich with dung and soyl,
 it may do reasonable well.</p>
                  <p>It will be best to stand warm if may be, preserved from North
 &amp; East wind, rather by hils than trees,<note place="margin">How a hop-garden
should stand.</note> as near your house as may be, &amp; that Land you
 determine for your Hop-garden, lay as levell &amp; as square as ye can
 possible, and if it be rough and stiff, it will do well to be sowed with Hemp,
 Beans or Turnips before; but in what state soever it be, till it in the
 beginning of Winter with plough or spade, &amp; this not onely the year before,
 but every year so long as you use it, &amp; the more pains and cost you bestow,
 the more profit, and the nearer you resemble the <hi>Flemming</hi> in his
 hopping.</p>
                  <p>And for your Sets, those are your Roots taken from your old
 hils &amp; roots, go to a garden ordarly kept,<note place="margin">Best hop-sets,
and where to have them.</note> where the Hops are of a good kind, all yearly
 cut, and where the hils are raised very high, for there the roots will be
 grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, &amp; buy choice Sets; they may cost six pence a hundred, and
 sometimes have them for taking up, leaving things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and their hill well
 dressed.</p>
                  <p>You must chuse the biggest roots you can find, such as are
 three or four inches about, and the Set nine or ten inches, 
 <pb n="242" facs="tcp:54116:136"/> long, and have three joynts in a root.</p>
                  <p>Take heed of Wild-hops they are onely discerned by the fruit
 and stalks.</p>
                  <p>The unkindly Hop that likes not his ground,<note place="margin">Signs of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable hop</note> soyl or kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, comes up
 green, and small in stalk, thick and rough in leaves like nettles, much bitten
 with a black fly, but it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes not the Hop, but hurteth it somewhat, and
 so you have the first particular.</p>
                  <p>2 The manner of planting as soon as your roots are got, either
 set them speedily or lay them in some puddle, or bury them in earth: but leave
 them not in water above four and twenty hours.</p>
                  <p>Then begin to direct your hils with a line;<note place="margin">How to make the hop-hills.</note> tyed with knots or threads
 thereto, the due distance had need to be 8 foot betwixt, because then you make
 the fewer and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get hils the sun comes about them, the poles reach not one
 another, and so it may be plowed yearly, otherwise it must be digged some say
 seven foot, and others say six foot, as our late accustomed manner is, and I am
 confident there is most advantage by thin planting, but that I leave to each
 experience.</p>
                  <p>Your hole under the knot of your line had need be a foot
 square and deep, then if you can have the wind South or West it is best,<note place="margin">The very time to plant in</note>, if not, go on having made many
 holes, matter not the wind: be sure to take the moneth of April for the work,
 and take two or three of your roots; as a great old Gardiner affirms, which by
 this will yeeld green Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or whit buds, and will have small beards
 growing out, and joyn your sets together even in the tops and set them
 altogether bolt upright, and there hold them in their place till you have
 filled the hole with good mould, &amp; set low, but just as the tops may be
 level with the ground, and then after they must be covered two inches thick
 with fine mould; be carefull you set not that end downward which before grew
 upward, which you know by the bud growing upward, and let no part of the dead
 stalk remaine upon the uppermost joynt thereof,<note place="margin">The best
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of setting the sets.</note> then press down the earth hard to the
 roots; some will set them every one at a corner of the hole under the line
 which I rather encline to, because they have room <pb n="243" facs="tcp:54116:136"/> and
 stand round; but if you plant late, &amp; have green Springs upon them, then be
 careful of not covering the Spring; but to set more plants lest some should
 fail, and in a bigger hole, and round about the same set 8; some say ten or
 more, which is thought tedious, but I will make a tryal thereof, it being the
 latest experimented in our dayes; now at this time you need make no hills at
 all there as aforesaid. Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery must be preserved from scratting, the Goose
 especially.</p>
                  <p>Now for poling,<note place="margin">How to pole them, &amp;
which poles are best.</note> if your distance be 3 yards, or 8 foot, then 4
 poles are repuired, else three wil serve, but I encline to 6 or 7 foot
 distance, and 4 poles, and as many this year as any. Alder poles are very good,
 taper and rough, and sutable to the Hops desire, but you must take such as the
 Country will afford.</p>
                  <p>The time of cutting your poles is in <hi>December</hi> or
 <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and then dress them and pile them up dry; if you leave some
 twigs it will not do amiss.</p>
                  <p>For length, 15 foot is a good length,<note place="margin">Poles
length.</note> except your ground be very rich, or your hills exceeding
 heightned, or if they grow too thick, your poles need to be the longer. The Hop
 never stocketh kindly untill it reach higher than the pole, and returneth a
 yard or two; for whilst it is climbing,<note place="margin">The best sort of
poling.</note> the branches that grow out of the principal stalk grow little or
 nothing. Your poles be strong, 9 inches about the bottom they stand faster: 150
 poles make a load, which may be worth a little more than ordinary wood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a
 few wil supply the standing stock;<note place="margin">And spediest way.</note>
 in setting your poles lay all to each hill you intend to set, which speeds the
 work.</p>
                  <p>When your Hops appear,<note place="margin">And best
sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> as you discern where your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal root stands, then set to
 poling, having a orow of Iron to make entrance for the pole; but if you stay
 longer, then you will be more subject either by ramming or making holes to
 bruise the root, or else they will not so easily catch the pole without
 flying.</p>
                  <p>Your foot of the pole must be set a foot and half deep, and
 within 2 or three inches of the principal root; but if your land be rocky, then
 you must help your self by making your hill higher to strengthen your poles,
 for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you must stay the longer too lest you bury your Sciences. Your poles
 of <pb n="244" facs="tcp:54116:137"/> each hill lean them rather outward one from another,
 and then with a rammer ram them outward and not inward</p>
                  <p>If a pole should break you take away the broken pole &amp; ty
 the top of those hops to the top of a new pole, then wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with the sun a
 turn or two, set it in the hole; but if you can take a stake and ty it too
 without wresting the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it may do well to peece; but if broken at the
 neather end shove the pole in again;<note place="margin">How to draw broken
hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles.</note> and if your poles break in the pulling up, or will not be
 drawn by reason of drought or hardness, you may make a pair of pinsors of 4
 foot long, with an iron runing hook upon them, &amp; with a block laid under
 upon the top of the hil, &amp; so coleweigh up your pole; the mouth whereof
 made hollow. And for laying up your poles,<note place="margin">How to lay the
poles.</note> the usual way is to ty two &amp; two together in the top, being
 set in 6 opposite hils, &amp; so raise a little earth betwixt the hils as if
 they were but three hils, and lay some hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands upon the 3 hils under your
 hop-poles, and so draw your tops nearer together, or further off as you see
 cause.</p>
                  <p>When your hops are grown two foot high,<note place="margin">How
to turne the hops to the pole.</note> bind up with a rush or grass your binds
 to the poles, as doth not of it self, winding them as oft about the poles as
 you can, &amp; wind them according to the course of the sun, but not when the
 dew is upon them: your rushes lying in the sun wil toughe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>And now you must begin to make your hils,<note place="margin">One of the main things in the hop-yard is raising the hils.</note>
 and for that purpose get a strong ho, of a good broad bit, &amp; cut or ho up
 all the grass in the borders between your hils, &amp; therwith make your hils
 with a little of your mould with them, but not with strong weeds, &amp; the
 more your hils are raised, the better, the larger, &amp; stronger grows your
 root, &amp; bigger will be your fruit: and from this time you must be painful
 in your garden, and ever and anon till the time of gathering, in raising your
 hils, and clearing your ground from weeds.</p>
                  <p>In the first year suppress not one science, &amp; suffer them
 all to climb up the poles, &amp; should you bury the springs of any one of your
 roots it would dy, so that the more poles are required to nourish the
 spring.<note place="margin">At first sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press not one science.</note> But after
 the first year you must not suffer above two or three stalks to grow up to one
 pole, but pul down and bury all the rest. Yet you may let them grow four or
 five foot long, and then chuse out the <pb n="245" facs="tcp:54116:137"/> best for use. As
 soon as your pole is set, you may make a circle how broad your hil shal be,
 &amp; then hollow it that it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the moysture, &amp; not long after
 proceed to the building of your hils.</p>
                  <p>And where you began, or where your Hops are highest there
 begin again, and pare again, &amp; lay them to your Hops, but lay the
 out-circle highest to receive moysture; be alway paring up, and laying it to
 the heap, and with some mould untill the heap coms to be near a yard high, but
 the first year make it not too high, &amp; as you pass through your garden have
 a forked wand in your hand to help the hops that hang not right.</p>
                  <p>Now these hils must the next year be pulled down &amp;
 dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed again every year.<note place="margin">How to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your hils. When
to break off the top of the hop bind.</note> Some when their hop bind is 11 or
 12 foot break off the tops, which is better than they that have their poles so
 long as the hop runs: but if that your hop by the midst of <hi>Iuly</hi> attain
 not to the top of your pole, then break off the top of the same hop, for then
 the rest of the time wil nourish the branches which otherwise wil lose al, it
 being no adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage in running up, to the stock or increase of the hop.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the gathering of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about <hi>Margarets</hi>
 day hops blow,<note place="margin">When hops blow and bell, and are ripe.</note>
 and at <hi>Lammas</hi> they bell; but when your hops begin to change colour is

 suffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to shed; they are called Midsummer hops; let them not grow til the

 pullers amain, &amp; as many as you can taking a fair season; &amp; note, you
 were better to gather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too early tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too late.</p>
                  <p>Therfore for neatness sake,<note place="margin">How to pull your
hops.</note> pul down four hils standing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the midst of your garden,
 cut the roots pare the same plot level, throw water on it, tread it, sweep it,
 and make it far, wherein the hops must lie to be picked.</p>
                  <p>Then begin &amp; cut the stalks close by the tops of the hils,
 &amp; cut the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> asunder that grow one into another with a long sharp hook, &amp;
 with a fork take them down; you may make the fork &amp; hook, one apt
 instrument with which you may shove off al from the pole, &amp; carry it to the
 place. But I have seen of late they carry pole &amp; all to the place and pick
 them off the pole: strait fine poles is best for this way, but cut no more
 stalks tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you can carry away in the space of one hour aforehand; for 
 <pb n="246" facs="tcp:54116:138"/> either sun or rain will offend when they are off the
 pole you must all stand round the floor, and speedily strip them in bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets;
 for it is not hurtfull though some smaller leaves fall among them.</p>
                  <p>And clear your floor twice a day,<note place="margin">Neatness
about them is very good.</note> &amp; sweep it, &amp; if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be unlike
 to be fair, they may be carried into the house in blankets, but use no linnen,
 it will stain to purpose. And if you pull them upon poles, then lay them upon
 forked stakes, &amp; dispatch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be careful of wet, lest they shed their
 seed, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the marrow of them. When you have leisure take up your poles and
 pile them, &amp; carry out your straw, &amp; so depart your garden till
 <hi>March</hi> unless it be to bring in dung. And for the advancement of your
 Hop-garden, get dung into your garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; lay on some in winter for to
 comfort &amp; warm the roots, your hills pulled down, &amp; let your roots lye
 bare all winter season: your old dung is best, rather none than not rotten.</p>
                  <p>And in <hi>April</hi> help every hil with a handful or two of
 good earth when the hop is wound about the pole,<note place="margin">How to dress
&amp; pruin the roots in Winter.</note> but in <hi>March</hi> you will find
 unless it hath been tilled, all weeds; but if you have pulled down your hils,
 and layd your ground as it were level, it will serve to maintain your hils for
 ever; but if you have not pulled down your hils you should with your ho as it

 dressing your roots you must cut away al such as grew the year before within
 one inch of the same; &amp; every year after cut the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as close to the old

 by the colour also, the main root being red, the other white, but if this be
 not early done, then they wil not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; &amp; if your Sets be small,
 and placed in good ground, &amp; the hill well maintained, the new roots will

 it is planted, the dressing the hills, the alleys, the hoing them, the poling,

 Acre, &amp; pulling, &amp; drying, and bagging by the day.</p>
                  <p>And so I shall proceed to the drying of them,<note place="margin">How to dry hops.</note> which may be done upon any ordinary kiln,
 with any wood that is dry, but not too old; or else good sweet Rie straw will
 do wel, but char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal best of all.</p>
                  <p>They must be laid about 9 or 10 inches thick, and dried a good
 while on that fide, &amp; then turned upside down, &amp; dried as much on the
 other side. About 12 hours wil dry a kiln full, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> must be followed night

 quarter. And so I come to my third particular, to shew you the profits &amp;
 advantages that are to be gained therby. One acre of good hops may possibly be
 worth at a good market 40, 50, or 60 pound: An acre may bear 11 or 12 hundred
 weight,<note place="margin">The profits may be made of hops.</note> possibly some
 have done more, many ten, but grant but eight hundred, they are sometimes worth
 not above 1. l. 4. s. the hundred, and some other times they have been worth
 12, or 14. l. a hundred, and usually once in three years they bring money
 enough. It is an excellent commodity if cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously &amp; well husbandried. I

 take right it is a very great advantage for price; it hath its ebbings &amp;
 its flowings, as almost all things have, yet I would fain give encouragement to
 this Improvement also. I shall briefly give you the story of it; Good land that
 is of the value of 20. s. an Acre being well husbandryed, tilled &amp; fitted,
 or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser land being well manured, &amp; brought to perfect tillage wil serve
 the turn; but the better, the better for the work. The season is about
 <hi>Midsummer</hi> which it is to be set, that being the season they usually
 take up, or draw their sets or roots and old store, when they may be had, &amp;
 no time else. The land being brought into perfect Tillage the best way is to
 make a tool like a ho in operation, but as broad as six of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it may be 15
 or 18 Inches broad, &amp; with that they draw their land into ranges, open as
 it were a furrow, about 2 or 3 inches deep, &amp; there place their sets or
 roots of Saffron about 2 or 3 inches asunder (which roots are to be bought by
 the strike,<note place="margin">How to set Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron.</note> sometimes dearer,
 &amp; sometimes cheaper, and are very like an Onion, a little Onion about an
 inch and a half over) and as soon as they have made one furrow all along their
 land from one end to another, then they, after that is set, begin another, and
 draw that which they raise next to cover this, and so as they make their
 trench, so they cover the other; they keep one even depth as near as may be,
 which ranges or furrows are not above three or four inches distance, that so a
 hoe of two or three incnches may go betwixt them to draw up the weed,<note place="margin">Saffron as green as a leek all Winte.</note> which being set and
 covered, it may come up that summer, but it dies again, yet it lives al winter,
 &amp; grows green like Chives or small Leeks, and in the begining of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer it
 dieth wholly the blade of it as to appearance, that so one may come &amp; take

 and then will come up the flower without the leaf, and in <hi>September</hi>
 the flower of it appears like Crocus that is blew, and in the middle of it

 chives, that is the very Saffron &amp; no maore, which you may take betwixt
 your fingers and hold it, and cast away all the rest of the flower and reserve
 that onely, and so they pick it, and they must pick it every morning early, or
 else it returns back into the body of it, to the earth againe, untill next
 morning and so from one to another, for a months space will it bear Saffron,
 you must get as many pickers as may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it before it strike in again at
 the very nick in the morning.</p>
                  <p>It will grow to bear 2 crops and then it must be taken up,
 &amp; planted new again, and then it will yeeld good store of sets to spare,
 which cannot be had no other way, it must be taken up at Midsummer and then set
 as aforesaid. And when you have got your Saffron, then you must set a drying of
 it,<note place="margin">How to dry Saffron.</note> and thus you must do, make a
 kiln of clay, not half so big as a Bee hive, and very like it will be made with
 a few little sticks and clay, and serve excellent well, for this service, a
 little small fire of charcole will serve to dry it, and it must be carefully
 tended also.</p>
                  <p>Three pounds of wet Saffron wil make one of dry Saffron.</p>
                  <p>An Acre of Land may bear 14. or 15 l. of Saffron, if very
 good, but if but 7 or 8 l. it will do the work; And one Acre of it wil be
 mannaged with no great charge, I do not beleive it can come to 4 l. an Acre, it
 hath been sold from 20 s. a pound to 5 l. a pound. It is an excellent advantage
 and brings in at worst a saving bargain, but it may possibly be worth 30 or 40
 l. an Acre; but if it come but to 7 or 8 l. it loseth not, so I have given thee
 a brief story wherein I would have been more large but having lost my
 observations upon it which I took when I was upon the very Lands, and received
 full satisfaction in every particular and member, or branch thereof, but as yet
 it hath not fell under my own experience; therfore I give the heads as I

 Liquorish as wee call it, not yet wrote of by any that I could ever see, is far

                  <p>3. The profits and advantages of it.</p>
                  <p>The best Land to raise your Liquorish upon is your richest you
 can get or make,<note place="margin">The best land for Liquorish.</note> your
 warmest you can find out, the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and dryest that is possibly to be had,
 of a very deep soyl, you must dig and prepare your Land before you set, and it
 must be digged three spades depth, and two or three shovellings at the least,
 laid as hollow &amp; light as may be: you may have it digged out of naturall
 Land if it be very rich indeed, that it will feed an Ox in a summer,<note place="margin">The

 an acre &amp; this is the main charge of all for three year, there is no more
 unless it be a little hoing, which will off hand very fast, I believe it will
 not cost above 20 s. an acre more all three yeares both in setting and all the 
 <pb n="251" facs="tcp:54116:140"/> dressings of it, besides the sets and Land: The sets
 being doubly trebly worth your money; sets have been sold for 2 s. the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
 &amp; more, sometimes are not worth above 1 s. a hundred, but if your Land be
 not fresh old Land,<note place="margin">Price of sets</note> or extraordinary
 rich, &amp; as rich as your best gardens are, it must be made so with soyles
 &amp; warm Manures, horse-dung is excellent to be intrenched into the Earth, it
 both warms and lightens it, and makes it very fit for this service. About
 <hi>London</hi> is very seruiceable Lands for it, &amp; so is on any dry soyl
 whatever where it is rich enough &amp; deep. Holland in Lincolnshire must needs
 be very good,<note place="margin">The place where best lands lye for this
use.</note> many of the Marshes that are sandy and warm most excellent, that
 which bears this well, wil also bear your Madder-weed that rich com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity: I
 hear that Liquorish grows naturally at <hi>VVorsop</hi> in
 <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinghamshire</hi> and about <hi>Pomphret</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> so
 also I heare your sparrow-grass grows naturally at <hi>Moulton</hi> within a
 few miles of <hi>Spauldwin</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> and so I proceed to
 my third particular.</p>
                  <p>Which is the best experimented way of planting of it.</p>
                  <p>Having digged and prepared your Land, and a little raked and
 evened the same, you may proceed to the Planting of it, &amp; therein you must
 indeavour the procuring of the best sets you can, and from the best and largest
 sort of Liquorish. The best sets are your Crown sets or heads got from the very
 top of the root a little shived down; be carefull of this, of very sound
 Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for how soon soever you come to the water your Liquorish will check
 and run not one inch further,<note place="margin">How to set your Plants.</note>
 and having procured your sets your ground being cast into beds of 4 foot broad,
 all along your plantation, from one end to another by a long line, you may lay
 down a set at every foot along the line, which line may have knots or thirds at
 every foot, if you be so exact, and then a man come with a tool made a little
 flattish if you will, or roundish, of the breadth or bigness of a good pickfork
 stail, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half a yard long with a crutch at the over end, and sharp at the
 neather, and that thrust into the ground, it being made of wood or iron, but if
 flat an iron one will do best, and open the hole well, and put in the set and
 close a little mould to it, and so you may overrun an acre very quickly in the
 setting of it, and if it should prove a very dry time,<note place="margin">If
dry, water <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

 must water your sets wo or three daies at first, untill you see they have
 recoved their <pb n="225" facs="tcp:54116:141"/> withered and wanness, and then the first
 year you may Plant your garden with Onions, Reddishe, or any sallet herb or any
 thing that roots not downward, and I am confident it will be better too,
 because it will prevent some weeding, and for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond it must be hoed and
 kept from weeds too, and a little the third; but one thing be very curious off,
 in the taking up and sudden setting thy sets, as soon as took up set again, but
 if you fetch from far, then as soon as taken up, put a little mould and post
 them away by horse back,<note place="margin">Time of plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> and get
 them into the ground as soon as possibly, the delay of setting, spoiles many
 thousand sets. The seasons of planting is in the month of <hi>Feb.</hi> and
 <hi>March</hi> You may the secoud year take some sets from your own stock, but
 be very curious thereof, but the third year you may take what you please and in
 the taking of the Liquorish up, the best season for which is in
 <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> then there runs from every master
 root, a runner which runs along the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver part of the ground, which hath a
 little sprouts and roots or sciences,<note place="margin">The Runuer yeelds good
sets.</note> which will yeeld excellent sets, if they be cut 3 or four of them
 in every set, which may be about 4 or five inches long, which is also to be
 planted, and is as good as the crown set, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so if it be any thing a moist
 time, you may take slips from the leaf or branches and set them; and they some
 of them will grow, but they may be set betwixt the other to thicken, lest they
 should fail.</p>
                  <p>There is abundance of Spanish sets come over of late. One M.
 <hi>Walker</hi> sells of them at <hi>Winchester</hi> house in <hi>Southwark
 London,</hi> but how good they be I am able to say little, but hear various
 reports of them, and therefore I will forbear, they are bought cheaper than
 English sets can be, but if they bring forth a small Spanish Liquorish I shall
 not much affect them.</p>
                  <p>The third particular is the profit &amp; advantage may be made
 thereby which is very considerable, but it is also subject to the ebbings and
 flowings of the market. It must be taken up in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and must be sold as
 soon as taken up,<note place="margin">When taken up, and when sold.</note> lest
 it lose the weight which it must needs do, you may make of one Acre of
 indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Liquorish 50. or 60 l. and of excellent good, 80. 90. or 100l. it
 is not of so great use as some other commodities are,<note place="margin">The

 others will, neither will it indure the keeping for a good market because it

 And it is most especially usefull upon you Marsh-land, Fen land, or upon your
 new recor vered Sea-land, or any lands, very rank and fat, whether ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or
 pasture.</p>
                  <p>The best seed is the biggest, fairest seed that you can get,

 <hi>Holland</hi> is the Center of it, from thence comes your good seed
 usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>The season of sowing,<note place="margin">Time of sowing</note>
 is at, or about Midsummer, you must have your land plowed very well, and laid
 even and fine, whether upon the lay, turf, or areable, and both may do well,
 but your arable must be very rich, and fat, and having made yovr land fine,
 then you may sow it, and about a gallon of seed will sow an Acre,<note place="margin">How much seed sowed upon an Acre.</note> the which seed must bee
 mingled, as afore was directed about the Claver, with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that you may
 sow it even, and not upon heaps; the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven sowing of it is very difficult, it
 grows up exceedingly to great leaves, but the benefit is made out of the seed
 especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>The time to cut it, is when one half of the seed begins to
 look browne, you must reap it as you doe wheat,<note place="margin">When to cut
it.</note> and lay it upon little yelmes, or two or three handfuls together
 till it be dry, and that very dry too, about a fortnight will dry it, it must
 not be turned nor touched, if it were possible, <pb n="254" facs="tcp:54116:142"/> for fear
 of shedding the seed, that being the chief profit of it; about a fortnight the
 seed will be dry,<note place="margin">How to use it.</note> it must bee gathered
 in sheets, or rather a great ship sail-cloath, as big as four or six sheets,
 and carried into the Barn, erected on purpose, or to that place designed on
 purpose to thresh it that day; you must have sixteen or eighteen men at a floor
 four men will thresh abundance in a day. I have heard that four men have
 threshed thirty Coume in a day.</p>
                  <p>The seed is usually worth sixteen shillings a Coume that is
 four shillings a busnell, sometimes more, and sometimes less.</p>
                  <p>It will, if exceeding good, bear ten Coume upon an acre, or
 five quarter;<note place="margin">How much an Acre may bear</note> if it be but
 indifferent, and will not bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove seaven or eight Coume of an Acre. It will
 raise a good advance upon your lands.</p>
                  <p>It is a commodity you will not want sale of, the greater the
 parcell is, the better price you will have. It is used to make the Rape-oyl, as
 we call it. The Turnep seed will grow among it, and it will make good oyl also,
 you may sell a thousand pound together to one Chapman, it is best to bee
 planted by the water, or near it.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be too rank, it Eadish or Stubble will excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
 nourish Sheep in Winter.</p>
                  <p>It hath another excellent property, it will fit the land so
 for corning, for Wheat it may produce a crop as good, or better than it self,
 and for Barley after that.</p>
                  <p>The charge of the whole Crop, I conceive may come to be
 betwixt twenty and thirty shillings an Acre,<note place="margin">The charge of an
Acre.</note> and a good Crop may be worth four, five, six, seven, or eight
 pound an Acre, the least is a very good improvement, because it will doe
 excellent well, if well ordered, and a kind season upon land the very first
 year after recovery, when it will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, if it can be but plowed,
 when other things as corn or grain may be hazarded; and so have you this

 to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Low-Countries, and I know not whither, for thred
 and cloath of so many sorts, and fine linnen, and cordage? or rather, why
 should we not, if we be at want of Work-men to make out to that worth and
 goodnesse, fetch here and there a workman from thence, and so preserve, or
 rather raise the Trade wholly within our selves, had we but Law put in
 execution to constrain people to labour, and some way to perswade men to use
 their Lands to the best advantage to themselves and publike, what should we
 want? We have the Commodity grows ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding well among us; we see we have and

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> To that I shall answer,
 people wee have enough you will confesse it, and some that can worke well too
 where is the fault then? I being not a Tradesman can scarce tell you, but onely
 will desire an answer to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: and then it may be I shall resolve
 you: what hath made cloathing common among us? and made Worke-men at it too,
 but the very Trade of it, the experimenting of it to purpose, the carring it on
 with power and purse, that by this meanes, where ever it is planted, there
 needs no work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks, they are ready to come from all parts where work may be
 had, then that is supplyed. It is true, at the first setting up, people are
 raw, untaught, and not very willing to learne, and may be (as ever it was,) in
 all new inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or setting up new works, you may suffer some losse and
 spoyle; yet if this be backed with publike countenance, and authority; I feare
 not any suffering at all, but if you should, you are but in the condition of
 all honest, publike ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spirits.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, I shall answer, that nothing ever did, or will
 come to perfection without great experiences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant practises, and great
 scrutiny into the bowels of it, and that will draw forth the mystery, and that
 is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and glory of all Trade and Merchandise, and then why we should
 not make fine cloath, and almost any cloth of our Flax, and raise our Flax to a
 great betterment too, I know not; I could name many things in <hi>England</hi>
 now, are made as good with us, as few yeares since wee could not, but were made
 altogether a beyond seas, and we supplyed from thence; but grant wee raise not
 so pure a Flax, then buy your Flax from the East or Best Countries endeavour
 the Trade of making your finer cloath thence, and your courser from our own,
 untill our Flax come up to theirs in goodnesse, which I am confident will
 refine exceedingly, both in the growth and workmanship of it; however use all
 meanes as to preserve the Trade of cloathing Linning, so far as our owne native
 Hempe and Flax will: I have heard of most pure cloath some Gentlewomen have
 made of their own flax, and Hemp.</p>

 try by rubbing of it in your hand, if it crumble with rubbing, it is bad, but
 if it still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its substance and colour, it is good.</p>
                  <p>The best land for it, is your warme land, your sandy,<note place="margin">Best hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> or a little gravelly, so it be very rich

 the land is very rich, and very sandy and light; but their morish land, though

 enough for it, yea that very land they are forced to dung and soyl exceedingly

 yard band will hold, which is the legal measure; but for your simple or Summer
 Hempe, that is bound in lesser bundles, as much as may be grasped with both
 your hands; and when your Winter Hempe is pulled, you must stocke it up, or
 barne it, any way to keep it dry, and then in the season of the yeare, or when
 you please, thrash it, and get out the seed, and still preserve your Hempe till
 you set to the working of it, which instead of breaking and tawing of it as
 they doe in most parts, there they altogether pill it, and no more, and so sell
 it in the rough; but I leave all at liberty for that, whether to pill or dresse
 up by brake and Tewtaw.</p>
                  <p>As for the seed an Acre will beare,<note place="margin">What
seed is worth.</note> is two or three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it is there sold but
 usually about a mark a quarter, sometime ten shillings, and sometime less, this
 yeare it was sold for twenty shillings a quarter, if good great Hempe, then
 store of seed, else not, but in many and most parts of the Nation it is sold
 for about four shilling a bushel.</p>
                  <p>Your fimbled Hempe is not worth above halfe so much as your
 other, sometimes it is subject to weeds, to carlock and muckel-weed, which must
 be weeded, but the best way to destroy them, is to let you Hempe-land lie one
 yeare fallow, I onely speake of <hi>Holland,</hi> the cheapest place for it and
 the first fountain of it, but generally throughout the Nation, it is of far
 more worth and value.</p>
                  <p>The richer your land is,<note place="margin">The best land for
Hempe.</note> the thinner, the poorer, the thicker, you must sow. One Acre of
 good Hempe may bee worth five, six, seven or eight pound an Acre, &amp; sold as

 it may come to eight, nine, ten, or twelve pound, or more, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

 any good sound Land, be it in what Country sover it will, if the land be good,
 either earthy or mixed of sand or gravel; and old land, it is the best, that
 hath lyen long unplowed, it had need come up to the value of a mark, or near
 twenty shillings an Acre,<note place="margin">3. l. given for slax Land.</note>
 that is your kindest slax-land, but I know where they give three pound an Acre
 to sow flax upon, within a mile of <hi>London,</hi> and yet in most Counties of
 <hi>England,</hi> I know as good and kind land for that husbandry, as any
 o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at <hi>London,</hi> they have work-men dearer too, and yet can
 raise (though they give so dear) a very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profit out beside.</p>
                  <p>Again, any of your good Arrable, that is in good Heart and
 rich, that is perfect sound drie land, is perfect good flax land. Some parts of
 <hi>Essex,</hi> from <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Stratford,</hi> down along the way,
 by the Marsh side, a great part of up-land thereabouts, is good flax Land, so
 is there very much in <hi>Kent,</hi> all along on the other side the river by
 the marshes side, is good naturall land thereto; in very many parts, about
 <hi>Maidstone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where the best thred is made of
 <hi>England,</hi> is excellent good flax-land: so is there also in most
 Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as <hi>Warwick-shire, Worcestershire, Northampton,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. And that I may give the more incouragement here to
 spin,<note place="margin">The several persons that slax imployes.</note> I say,
 as heretofore, it is a commodity that will set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of persons upon an
 honest and profitable calling, from the first preparing the land, untill the
 fruit of your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours come in; one acre of good flaxe may maintain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
 persons to the compleating of it to perfect cloth: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how many Trades
 are supplyed hereby.</p>
                  <p>1. The Land must have the same husbandrie of plowing;
 harrowing and sowing, as lands have for corne, there's the husbandmans
 businesse, sometimes, yea many times weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too, then pulling, stitching and
 drying, then rippelling, and laying up and preserving the seed, then watering
 it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the ground, or in the water, then drying it up, and housing it,
 and kilne-drying it, then breaking and towtaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="261" facs="tcp:54116:145"/> it,
 then hetchelling and dressing it up; then spinning of it to yarne or thred,
 then weaving of it, and bleaching, then it returnes againe to the good
 house-wives use or Seamster, and then to the wearing and usage, and all these
 particular imployments be upon this poore businesse, halfe a dozen good
 callings and imployments this makes out, and therefore many persons it will
 imploy, and we both want cloth, and our poor work.</p>
                  <p>3. Now as to the carrying on this design,<note place="margin">How to raise the best flaxe.</note> and making the best of this
 improvement, I shall here give in the best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved way of planting of it, as
 is yet discoved; as for the Land, let it be good and well plowed, both strait
 and even, without balkes, and in due season, about the beginning of
 <hi>March,</hi> or the latter end of <hi>February.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for the seed, the true East Country seed, is far the
 best,<note place="margin">Best flax seed.</note> although it cost very dear, one
 bushel of it to sowe; is worth ten bushels of our owne Couetry seede; but the
 second crop of our own, of this Country seed, is very good, and the third
 indifferent, but then no more, but again to your best seed.</p>
                  <p>The quantity of it is about two bushels upon an Acre at least,
 some sow a pecke more; but I conceive two may bee enough, but of our seed it
 will require halfe a strike more then of the East Country seed, you may buy it
 in the Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens shops at <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> our Flax men in former dayes
 did not sow above half so much, or little more, but now their experience hath
 brought them to this pitch.</p>
                  <p>At my first knowledge of the East-country flax seede,<note place="margin">An experiment of both sorts of seed.</note> for the perfect
 discoverie of the goodnesse of it, I sowed one land, the ridge or middle of the
 Land with our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie seed, and both the furrowes with this Dutch or
 East-country seed, our seed was incompassed with this, as with a wall abought
 it, it so much over-grew it in height.</p>
                  <p>The season of sowing of it, if a warme season, in the latter
 end of <hi>March,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The season for sowing flax.</note> but
 in the warmer parts, as <hi>Essex,</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> I conceive mid
 <hi>March</hi> may doe well, but in colder parts, as down towards
 <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> and <hi>Worcester-shire,</hi> the beginning of
 <hi>April</hi> may be early enough, and if it <pb n="262" facs="tcp:54116:146"/> should
 come a very wet seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you must take care of weeding of it also, and in the
 ripening of it, you must be careful, that it grow not till it be over-ripe,
 lest the stalk should blacken or mildew, yet to his full ripeness you must let
 it grow, the which you may perceive both by the harle, and by the seed; some
 will ripen earlier, and some later, as you sow it earlier or later, but against
 it be ripe, be sure to have your pluckers to fall in hand with plucking of it,
 and then tie up every handfull, and then set them up upright, one against
 another, like a Tent, till they be perfectly drie, and then get it all into the
 ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne, or where you please to
 preserve it for use, it is indifferent whether you ripple it, or take off the
 boles of it, as soone as you bring it home, or when you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to use it.</p>
                  <p>As for your watering of it, whether in the water or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the
 Land,<note place="margin">The manner of watering of it.</note> that I shall not
 determine peremptorily, but thus much I say, that both may doe well, and he
 that gets store, will find use of both: because of the one, you make use as
 soone as your flax is pulled, and then you need not stand so curiously upon the
 drying of it, but after you have got your seed, you may water it, and the
 watering of it, opens, and breakes the harle the best; but then you must bee
 carefull of laying up your seede, that it heate not, nor mould, and that which
 you water then, may be a winters worke for your people untill the Spring come
 on, and then get it forth upon your grasse Land, and spread it thin, and turne
 it to preserve it from mildewing, and keepe it so untill you finde the harle
 bee ready and willing to part from the core, and then drye it up and get it in
 for use.</p>
                  <p>As for the drying of it, a kilne made on purpose is best, so
 that you be carefull of scorching of it, this will make greate riddance of the
 same, and to them that have greate store, sunne-drying will never doe the
 feate, though it may doe well for a small quantity, or the flax of a private
 Family.</p>
                  <p>As to the working of it, you must provide your Brakes and
 Tewrawes both, the one, and that is the <pb n="263" facs="tcp:54116:146"/> brake which
 bruises and toughens, the harl, and the Tewtaw that cut and divides out the
 coare, if you use the Tewtaw first, it may cut your well dryed flax to peeces,
 yet both do best, yet the brake first.</p>
                  <p>These things are common and known to many in most Countries
 but not to all, and least to those that have lands most capable thereof.</p>
                  <p>It will cost the Workmanship of it,<note place="margin">The
charge of the flax from the beginning till it come to the Market.</note>
 betwixt three and four pound an Acre to bring it up to sale, it lyeth much
 up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the workmans hand, and therefore far more to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by how much
 the more it raiseth imployment, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people to live thereby.</p>
                  <p>Where wages is great, it comes off the hardest; yet where it
 is carried on to purpose, people flock hard that want work, and because of
 constancie, will worke at easie tearms, else how could they possibly do good of
 it at <hi>London,</hi> or near about it, where they work at double rates, but
 there have I seen the best flax I ever saw.</p>
                  <p>4. Lastly, the benefit that may be made hereby, an Acre of
 good flax, may be worth upon the ground, if it be the first East-Country seed,
 seven or eight, yea, possibly ten or twelve pound, yea far more, the charge
 whereof beside the seed, untill it be ripe, may not be above ten shillings an
 acre, which if you work up to be fit to sell in the Market, it may come up to
 fifteen, or sixteen, or near twenty pound in the market, but to bring it so
 high, as thirty pound, as in <hi>Flanders,</hi> I dare not say.</p>
                  <p>But an acre of our Country seed, will hardly come up to above
 three pound or four pound an Acre; unlesse very good indeed, to which if it
 amount unto, and no more upon the Land, it will make a good advancement of the
 Land, which may be, Land, and Seed, and all charges, may come to about fifteene
 or sixteene shillings an Acre, the seed being not worth above two shillings a
 strike.</p>
                  <p>I shall say thus much more, that I verily believe wee are not
 come up to that perfection, wee may attain unto in this mystery, because I have
 heard of some Gentlewomen that <pb n="264" facs="tcp:54116:147"/> have out of their owne
 Flax and Hempe drawne out a thred exceeding pure, as pure and fine againe as
 our ordinary Traders therein doe, and have made as much more cloath of a pound
 of both, and that both strong, and more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, then the strongest and
 best Outlandish Hollands;<note place="margin">The flax and Hempe-trade not come
to perfection.</note> and I am confident, if this mystery doe but receive
 incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from Authority, and it made more tending to publike good, the
 maintenance of the poore in worke, and sequestring the Trade so farre to our
 owne proper Natives, as may be a sufficient Magazine of work for them. I am
 sure we have land suitable enough to bear it, and to afford suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient profit,
 and will be a considerable advance unto the lands throughout the Nation.</p>
                  <p>And so I hope I have supplyed in some measure, more of our
 deficiencies that really are, and are said to be in our <hi>English</hi>
 Husbandry.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd for making good the Improvement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, I shall shew
 these two or three things. 1. That abundance of Land is planted in many parts
 of this Nation, and thus improved. 2. That there is land, and very much, in all
 other parts that may be improved. 3: The fruits especially, by which they come
 to such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
                  <p>1. That there is such land alreadey improved,<note place="margin">What parts prove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements.</note> none dare deny; to that
 height as is affirmed, many will question: I therefore doe in briefe affirme
 for my president, that, <hi>VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire,</hi> part of
 <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> and part of <hi>Herefordshire</hi> will speake out
 this truth, some men having their Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both of Apples, Pears, and
 Cheries, and so ordered that they hinder no more the growth of grasse then the
 compasse of a tree that grows upon it, nay, some question whether with their
 shadinesse in Summer, and warmnesse in Winter, they better not the land farre
 more, and their very growing <pb n="266" facs="tcp:54116:148"/> upon it doth not inrich it,
 they having usually the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest grasse, and many times the greatest swath and
 bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and will keep more cattell too. And certainly where they are formerly
 planted, and grow not too thicke, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see reason to the contrary; as for
 the land, I know very much, if not most of it, was worth, not above tenne
 shillings, some lesse, or thirteen shillings foure pence an Acre at the first,
 now the grasse of most of them thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly planted, and draw as they grow
 in bignesse (that so they may never grow to touch one another by a good space,
 when they come to the best age, for when they come to decay, plant new ones in
 their roome, and downe with them to the very grouud (I say the grasse of such
 Orchards or Pastures is worth thirty shillings, some forty shillings, some
 fifty shillings, and some more, and the fruit that groweth upon the Trees
 planted therein, may yeeld some three pound, some five pound, yea, some will
 come up to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight pound an Acre.</p>
                  <p>But come you up to <hi>Kent, Essex, Surry, Middlesex,</hi> and
 part of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> where naturally the land was worse then in those
 parts by farre; I dare affirme there are many Orchards planted there upon land,
 that was not naturally and really worth above six shillings,<note place="margin">What Nurce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of young Trees may improve.</note> or eight
 shillings an Acre, when they began the work, and that some thousands of Acres
 too, and with some good soyle, and good husbandry, dividing, quicksetting, and
 laying dry and sound their land, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening some, and planting others with
 kernels of all sorts of fruits, and all sorts of woods, and sets, and trees,
 have brought many plots, some containing five or six acres, some to ten, or
 twelve, and some to twenty or thirty acres, in one plot, to that improvement
 that they have made twenty pound an acre, yea, if I should say forty or fifty
 pound, I should finde sufficient testimony to the truth hereof, and all this
 while but in preparation for a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation too, their young trees being not
 come yet to beare, nor to shade the land, and then they lay it downe to grasse;
 but say the land was worth twenty shillings an acre, and some is, and very much
 worth more, which is so much <pb n="267" facs="tcp:54116:148"/> better it will prosper, and
 so much lesse cost need bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, and yet by all, will be made good the
 improvement promised. These Orchards many of them are worth to grasse forty,
 fifty, or three pound <hi>per</hi> acre, and so set; their fruite will seldome
 yeeld them so little as double or treble the worth of their grasse, many times
 five or six fold, yea, possibly ten fold, and what is this towards the making
 good my improvement promised.</p>
                  <p>If this land was not worth above six or ten shillings an acre,
 as very much was not,<note place="margin">How land is improved to twentyfold by
Orcharding.</note> then it is fourfold doubled in the grazing, and if it treble
 in the fruit, then there is sixteenfold, and if it come up to sixfold in the
 fruit, then there is two and thirty fold. I will go no higher, but I might, and
 many doe and will, the cost bestowed, for the two, three, or four first yeares
 may be was three or foure pound an Acre, may be five pound, but then the Garden
 fruits which they raised upon them, the sets, the grafts, the trees, and fruite
 they raise upon it, may bee possibly worth as much more as it is worth, when it
 comes to be laid down to grasse, but then it costs no more then mowing their
 grasse, and gathering their fruit, and yet during the flourishing condition of
 this Orchard, it shall hold forth the improvement aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But some will say this may be true in some

 commodity, or attain to an excellent mystery in his Trade, do not all men study
 it, thirst after it, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it, and may gain it?</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>You will say our land is not so good, there is

may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove as well as that which is improved.</note> It is but very few ages,
 since these Countries have been so famous; every age hath exceedingly improved,
 and this very last age as it were almost doubled what former ages came to; and
 truly when you have made the same experience, you will finde your Land as good,
 and by good husbandry with a strong resolution to the same end, will bring
 forth the accomplishment of the same fruit;<note place="margin">Object.</note>
 and so I shall proceed to an answer of the second part of the objection, which
 is, there is little such land, or little fit land for this use in many Counties
 in <hi>England,</hi> which brings mee to my second particular,<note place="margin">Answer. 2.</note> which is to shew that there is land as well in
 all Countries,<note place="margin">The natured lands upon which the
chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festfruits doe grow.</note> and Counties, as those lands of <hi>Kent
 Essex, Surry,</hi> &amp;c. and very much in many, where is no improvement at
 all made thereon; and that I thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, by inquiring into the nature
 and qualifications of these lands, and these lands are many of them exceeding
 dry, sound, warme lands, some perfect sand, some gravelly, some of a very
 shallow mould, not above halfe a spades pitch before you come to hunger and
 barrennesse, some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding stony, some of them are upon a very rich soyle, as
 by the Marshes sides, some of them are upon a cold, spewing wet, clayey land,
 but made rich, and warme by soyle and husbandry, and some upon a perfect clay,
 cold and barren; and yet upon them all, you have exceeding great advances, as
 aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>And that there is some such natured lands in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
 and in some all these natured lands directly, no man will deny, and also meanes
 and soyles to inrich them, though not so much;<note place="margin">Answ.
3.</note> but yet I am sure many times more then is improved to so good an
 advantage and more may be made,<note place="margin">Lands of the same nature may
raise the same improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and gained to inrich them, if wee grow
 industrious. And now that I have proved there is such natured lands, what
 remaines to cleare the full demonstration, but that as great advancement may

                  <p>Why this remaines, that they are not under so warme a
 Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, as those Lands are, which is true, and this is all that can be said,
 to which I answer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:54116:149"/>1. <hi>Ans.</hi> That the climate is
 much to the drawing forth these fruits,<note place="margin">The climate but a
very smal hindrance.</note> and especially to the drawing them forth so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
 but yet not sufficient excuse to hinder the work, for then why should
 <hi>Glocester-shire, Worcester-shire,</hi> and <hi>Hereford-stire</hi> be so
 famous; I am confident they are as natural and as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full this way, as these
 Countries are, only I beleive they are not so quick for sale, nor so early
 ripe, may be by a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night of dayes, which is nothing.</p>
                  <p>And the climate is as cold in these Countries, as in almost
 any, except two or three of the Northern Countries, in which Countries are very
 much good fruits, and many good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards too, and why not more I know not, I
 doe confess Cherries grow upward, more rich, early, and more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, then
 in other parts, yet <hi>Worcester-shire</hi> comes near them, but what if they
 come not up so high? they may come up high enough, and wee see they will grow
 well, and to good profit in other parts, as well as here. But say there was not
 a cherry growing in any of those parts: I should not much matter, they being
 only for delight and pleasure, yet if good Peares for Perry and Aples for Syder
 would prosper well,<note place="margin">Sloth and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance the greatest
hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</note> which I am confident they would, if
 indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously experimented, which would be for the great supply of the poor,
 &amp; the whole Countrie for every Town &amp; House almost hath an Orchard
 bigger or lesser, that doe, and will bear both Apples and Peares of all sorts
 whatsoever, and all Countries have Lands naturall therefore, as well as these,
 where there is so great improvements made, and therefore I know neither nature
 nor reason against the same, nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but ignorance, sloth and
 prejudice, and so farre as I know, or I beleive any man else knows, there is
 Land e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in every Country suitable hereunto, however to make a very
 substantiall and gallant improvement, if not altogether so great as these. And
 as for the sale of them, or Perry, or Syder, we need not much trouble our
 selves, nor hinder our improvements thereby, untill our selves, our Neighbours
 and the poor about us are supplyed, and then, when wee have it to spare, to
 sell it; it may bee transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much by water, and many places by Cart to
 places of <pb n="270" facs="tcp:54116:150"/> vent, whereas some of it, &amp; that most
 excellently made, (these dayes will teach us (may be sold for Wine, &amp; in
 thousands of places now it is; &amp; serves as well as that, for men to fox
 their neses, befool themselves, and wast their patrimony: And so I hope I have
 sufficiently proved the capacity of advancement of many thousand acres of
 Lands, upon this account; yea the great advance might be, if you planted but
 all your barren &amp; empty hedges with good fruit Trees, and so I descend to
 my last particular which is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the speciall fruits I intended and they were these
 five: 1 the Vine, 2 the Plumb, 3 the Cherry, 4 the Pear, and 5 the Apple.</p>
                  <p>First, As to the Vine &amp; Plumb, I intended not them
 direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this account, as to the great adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage their plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would
 raise Lands unto, because they would be confined to lesser quantities of Land,
 but chiefly to shew the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges might be raised through their own
 plantations.</p>
                  <p>And for Vines in relation to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves,<note place="margin">That Wines may be made in England feasibly.</note> I did intend a
 large discourse, wherby to have presumed to have raised a publike experimenting
 of them to this effect, as thence to have raised good and usefull Wines which
 that it may feasibly be done (in this season of Wines dearth (I have these two
 grounds.</p>
                  <p>1 Because the South-west parts of <hi>England</hi> are within
 one degree South of the Northern parts of <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Bramont;</hi>
 yea the very Latitude of <hi>Paris</hi> it self is not two degrees South of us:
 but,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, and chiefly, because it hath been made already in
 many parts, as in divers places in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> &amp; many
 o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, as old Chronicles report, &amp; that frequently, &amp; may
 unquestionably be raised, in case we fail not in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
 Plantation, but hit that right; But for a weighty reason hereafter discovered,
 I shall say no more.</p>
                  <p>But for the three last, the Cherry, Pear &amp; Apple, I had
 abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly resolved to handle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at large in the whole mystery of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both
 in Setting, Planting, preserving, pressing, barrelling &amp; Merchandizing of
 them; to clear up the great advance Lands may be raised to by their
 Plantations; but that in this very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, whlist I was about the very work,
 Mr. <hi>Samuel Hartlib,</hi> 
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:54116:150"/> that publike spirit, sent
 me in this assurance, (with his desire that I would not publish it to the
 world) that an <hi>Oxford</hi> Gentleman, called <hi>Ra. Austen,</hi> an Artist
 both learned and experienced, had finished a Work fit for the Press, of
 approved experiments in Planting late Fruit, from better Rules than have
 hitherto yet been published, of which taking notice, I was most willing not
 onely to publish, but (to imbrace the tender, upon a double score.</p>
                  <p>First, my own, and secondly, the publike advantage.</p>
                  <p>1. My own advantage is great (being tyred out with journy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
 &amp; travels, to evidence my experiences the more candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the world (to
 be ceased from the writing thereof, by one better able to hold it forth, having
 made it his Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, both of study and recreation: A brief discourse
 wherof would have made a considerable Book.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, upon the publike advantage too, who her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are
 like to communicate in a more full and copious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Art and
 Mystery therof, from him that hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged singlely in this business rather
 than from my self, that could but confusedly, and not have been so large and
 full as he may bee: Besides, this pregoing piece of mine (though possibly of
 little worth) might have stifled a better &amp; larger in the birth upon a
 discouragement, lest the free sale therof migh in some measure; have been
 retarded hereby. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore durst not neglect to receive the motion with most
 reall and candid imbracings.</p>

                  <p>In the discourse whereof I should have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken distinctly as I
 could, and have laboured to have laid naked the Mystery of each of them with
 the best <pb n="272" facs="tcp:54116:151"/> and latest husbandring of them according to use
 and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of our now present art of Planting; but expecting it more large
 in all the members and branches, thereof from so lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and experienced a

 hope to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my promise, better by my silence, then in holding them
 forth under so brief, and confused discoveries, as I have done many other in my
 foregoing Discourse, and should for want of time been forced to have done
 these.</p>
                  <p>And so I shall conclude all, and my whole Discourse with a few
 words to my main scope and aime, which is to affirme and prove, that by these
 Plantations, Lands may come to a very great advance; yea, unto as great as the
 greatest that is affirmed in my Frontispiece; but yet never to that height, as
 some have fondly imagined, and doe affirm in word, and have done in Print, they
 can raise land to, many whereof are from severall sorts of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-commodities,
 as from some of these, and from the great million Pompion, which I least matter
 to own of all the rest, I being once so weak as to come to an agreement with
 Mr. <hi>Speed,</hi> who writes such high things, as reason cannot fathom, to
 discover his particulars to me, which he gave me in writing, some whereof were
 some of these Garden-commodities, and another the planting of Conies upon hard
 land, all which (except the Pompion) were as well knowne before to my selfe, as
 to him, but not, that from them to raise so great advantages, I never knew, nor
 shall: and some other things, he told me of, as laying up coals at
 <hi>Newark</hi> in a dear time, which I fear the Merchant hath found out that,
 and to keep them till they grow scarce, and ingross them, and hold them up to
 an exceeding price, but of the manner how this must be done, and some few other
 things, promising him not to reveal them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>I will say no more; for in regard I never phactised them, I
 have forgot them, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> shall

                     </gap> certainly now must 
 <pb n="273" facs="tcp:54116:151"/> needs have made more full experiences of them, it being
 near two year since I had first acquaintance with him: but the aforesaid being
 my own as well as his, and all mens as well as ours, I shall make bold to
 discover them to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment (for as to his I shall never attain) and that
 is to incourage their Plantations, because Lands may be highly advanced by
 them, and when thou hast the Art of planting dismysteried to thee at large, as
 will be very shortly, fall upon them.</p>
                  <p>And because Land of great quantities cannot be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to
 that height,<note place="margin">Charges and hazards in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening cuts the comb
of its greatest hopes.</note> as lesser parcels, which are within the power and
 purse of the Gardner, which with his constant paines, watching, toilings,
 hazards and adventures, he runs, he may make one hundred pound possibly out of
 some one Acre of Land, if his commodity prosper well, as some have done; but in
 the case of non prosperity, some are half undone again, as if it thrive not
 exceedingly in the growth, prosper not as well in the ripening, escape frost,
 and thieves, and meet not with a good market, what it will come to then I
 determine not, neither doth Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> consider of these things, and
 how then it would do, when thousand of Acres should come to be planted
 therewith I know not, I shal leave it to him to resolve, and onely take out
 Turneps, mainly intending my design, which will be sowed at small cost and
 charge, and grow upon indifferent Land, and bring forth great increase, and are
 of more generall use: and in case much Land be sown therewith, and they come to
 so great plenty, that the Markets will not carry them away, at such a
 proportionable rate, as the Gardner can afford them, then may they be disposed
 of, to the feeding of sheep and Cattel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they will doe, and to good
 advantage too,<note place="margin">How Turnep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> will help out the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment though Markets fail. How Turnep
makes bread in a dear year.</note> and in a dear year, to make bread thereof,
 half meal, half boyled Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nep, mixed and wrought together into dough, and
 kneaded and made into bread, will make a good and delightfull food, as hath
 been by many experimented already; yea, as Sir <hi>Richard Weston</hi> affirmed
 to my selfe, he did feed his swine with them, though all men hold the contrary,
 that Swine will not eat a Turnep, (so I say too) no more than a Scot will 
 <pb n="274" facs="tcp:54116:152"/> Swines-flesh, yet the boyling them at first, and giving
 them to his Hogs in good wash, and afterward all boyled, that at the end they
 came to eat them raw, &amp; would run after the Carts,<note place="margin">How
Hogs may be kept and fed with Turneps.</note> and pull them forth as they
 gathered them.</p>
                  <p>So that upon these accounts, and because I know it will bring
 Land to a good advance, as unto 8. pound, 10. pound, or possibly 12. pound
 <hi>per</hi> acre, I propose this espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; but for the fuller discovery
 hereof in the mysterie, I leave that to be more fully discussed in the Art of
 planting, and should that fail of seasonable comming forth, or of a full
 discovery, it is but about eight or ten quarts of seed sowed upon an acre of
 dry sound land, indifferent rich land, well plowed, digged and harrowed, as for
 corn, and then after sowed thin, and even with some composition with it; &amp;
 then slightly covered with a bush,<note place="margin">What Turnep seed sowes an
Acre, and how to order it throughout.</note> some sowed early, where the land
 will do, &amp; some late, when other crops are off; &amp; selling them, or
 spending them at a Market-pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
 they will bring forth the advantage promised, and so I have indeavoured to
 supply this deficiency in husbandry, also in some poor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the want of
 improving our garden-fruits, our Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as capable of improvement this
 way, and as high, as is by their Brabant husbandry, and so am come to my
 desired end at last, all which I commend to thy patience, and thy self, and it
 to the word of our Lord Christ his blessing.</p>
