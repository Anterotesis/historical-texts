            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A declaration touching a booke lately
printed &amp; entituled, The Profane ſcheſme of
the Brovvniſtes.</head>
            <p>CHriſtian reader, there vvas of late a booke publiſhed in
London vnder this title, <hi>The profane ſchiſme of the Brouniſtes;</hi>
Such a booke indeed vve ſent by one of vs to be printed there, but
in the publiſhing thereof great iniury hath bene done vnto vs,
&amp; chiefely three vvayes, by addition, by detraction &amp; by altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſame:</p>
            <p>For the firſt, beſides the addition of ſundry harſh vvordes &amp;
phraſes of <hi>hereſies, blaſphemies, diabolus, horrible crimes</hi> &amp; <hi>c.</hi> in
ſuch place vvhere they vvere not vſed by vs, vvhich yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the doctrine of the Brovvniſtes themſelves may iuſtly
be applyed vnto them; beſides the addition in the title of the
booke vvhich is doubly encreaſed by the publiſher thereof; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
the addition of the other titles of the ſeverall chapters vvith
a nevv table thereof added in ſtead of that vvhich vve had made;
beſides ſundry other ſuch additions, there be alſo added ſome
thinges directly contrary to our meaning &amp; ſuch as never came
into our heads, as namely thoſe vvordes in the end of the prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
<hi>as alſo to vvarne all ſuch as haue bene the occaſion of thoſe hereſies</hi> &amp;
<hi>ſchiſmes to conforme themſelues to the church of God, that theſe caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
may no more riſe out of them. And although vve be</hi> &amp; <hi>c.</hi> By tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
vvordes the reader might conceive as though vve affirmed
thoſe miniſters vvhich do refuſe ſubſcription &amp; conformity vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the prelacy &amp; ſuperſtitious ceremonies vſed in the church of
England, to have bene the occaſion of Brovvniſme &amp; guilty of
that ſchiſme &amp;c. But the truth is othervviſe, there vvere no
ſuch vvordes vvritten in the booke vvhich vve ſent to be printed,
but they are foyſted in &amp; obtruded vpon vs by ſome falſifyer
vvithout our knovvledge or conſent, Our iudgement is that
<pb facs="tcp:2643:3"/>
the tyranny of Lord BBs &amp; their impoſitions are a ſtumbling
block vnto many that are vveake vvhich do thereby take occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to fall from the church &amp; to runne into ſchiſme. VVe aſſure our
ſelves that if there vvere in the church of England ſuch a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the prelacy &amp; ceremonies as is deſired by the miniſters
there &amp; is alſo obteyned in other reformed churches, there
vvould not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſuch a defection vnto Brovvniſme as novv the
re is. VVe knovv indeed that the Brouniſtes do ioyne vvith the
prelates in vpbrayding the miniſters vvith this thing &amp; vvould
ſeeme to build their ſeparation vpon the teſtimony of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
as appeareth by this booke of <hi>Deleſcluſe,</hi> vvhere he labours
to conclude their ſeparation from certaine ſpeeches of <hi>Mr.
Brightman</hi> teſtifying againſt the corruptions of the church of
England, but hovv vniuſtly &amp; abſurdly he hath done the ſame
vve hope it vvil evidently appeare by this refutation follvving.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is in ſumme left out the greateſt part of the
booke vvhich vve ſent to be printed, yea in exact account there is
not a fourth part there of that is printed: In ſpeciall there is not
a third part of the preface printed vvherein our reaſons for the
maner of publishing that booke are conteyned; there is left out
a large anſvver vnto a narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by <hi>Mr. Iohnſon</hi> touching
an offer of conference that vvas made vnto him; likevviſe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver
vnto the groundes of ſcripture alledged by <hi>M. Iohnſon</hi> in
in defence of ſeparation is left out; Divers teſtimonies of Dutch
&amp; french miniſters againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be omitted, vvith other vvritin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
of <hi>Iohn Iohnſon &amp; George Iohnſon</hi> that ſhould have bene prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
The greateſt part of the vileſt ſlanders of the Brouniſtes are
left out: The greateſt number of the chapters by far is omitted;
that vvhich ſhould have bene the tenth chapter is made the firſt
nine of the firſt being altogether omitted, beſides ſundry other
in the middes of the booke; &amp; of thoſe chapters that are there, no
one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is fully ſet doune, &amp; in ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> half the
matter omitted: Divers ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge matters are noted in the booke, but
the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there of, the profes thereof vvith the anſvver vnto
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2643:3"/>
the vaine cavilles &amp; ſhiftes of the Brouniſtes about the ſame are
omitted, &amp; in reſpect of theſe omiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s divers thinges ſo abruptly
ſet dovvne may ſeeme more harſh &amp; alſo more incredible vnto
the reader; ſo that hereby it may eaſily appeare hovv vve are iniu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ried
by vnreaſonable omiſſions as vvell as by vniuſt additions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for the method &amp; order of ſetting dovvne theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
that are printed, there is great alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therein alſo: Thinges
ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are related vpon an other, &amp; not in their
due place; The ſpeeches of one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ſo ſet doune as if they had
bene ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by an other; The ſpeeches of divers men are peeced
togather as if they had bene ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by one &amp; the ſame perſon. In
theſe &amp; ſuch like cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges both vve &amp; thoſe vvhoſe teſtimonies are
alledged by vs have receyved ſome further iniurye.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe thinges there be alſo as it appeareth many lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
faults in the miſprinting of ſundry vvordes vvhich do much
corrupt the ſenſe of ſundry thinges in the booke.</p>
            <p>And though thus many &amp; great iniuries be done vnto vs yet do
vvee not hitherto fully vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are done: Onely
this vve vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by a letter ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chr. Lavvne vvho vvas e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſted
vvhich this buſines, that the according to the order in ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
caſes ſeeking vnto ſuch as vvere appoynted for the allovva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of bookes to be printed, &amp; leaving it in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of a certaine cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plaine
of the Archb to get it read over &amp; vievved u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>till he himſelf
might returne out of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try into vvhich he vvas the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> going

            <p>And hovvſoever vve do novv diſclayme this booke above mentioned as
none of ours being thus corruptly printed vvith ſuch additions, omisſions
&amp; alterations, yet do vve ſtill acknovvledge that all the particular matters
of fact recorded againſt the the Brvvoniſtes in that booke are ſuch tiges as

vniuſtly applied againſt them who are aſſured of their lawfull communion with

the divided &amp; diſtracted Browniſtes, who halt betweene two opinions, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two communions, ſome halting after the Franciſcane order, ſone lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
after the Ainſworthian &amp; popular order, ſome hanging in doubt betwixt

what meanes he by this ſpeech of <hi>his God,</hi> in ſaying, the glory of <hi>my God?</hi>
Hath he and his flock a ſpeciall God of his owne more then other churches of
Chriſte? It is true indeed that David &amp; other faithful ſervants of God do often
with the voyce of faith vſe to ſpeak of God in this manner, <hi>my king and my
God as Pſ.</hi> 84. 3. but yet if we looke a litle further into the profeſſion of the
Browniſtes we may eaſily imagine ſome other cauſe of their ſpeaking on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
for whereas R. R. in his prophecying among the prophets of Mr. Aniſwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
company teſtifyed againſt their ſeparation &amp; iuſtifyed the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
to be a true church, being for this vniuſtly excommunicate of that company
it was as vniuſtly defended by Mr. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> who layd this groud of his exco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mmunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </gap> and therfore no marvel if according to this opinion they ſpeak of their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

Browniſt pretending that Chriſte is not our king doth hereby ſacrilegiouſly
both deprive Chriſte, of his people &amp; his people of their God, their ſaviour &amp; their

do prayſe and commend him for it, but yet if he had bene as ſober and modeſt

how prone this man is to runne into errour and to go aſtray out of the
way before many others? Among all their Prophets is there any which in the
exerciſe of prophecy have ſo often bene corrected for errour as this man? His
manner is indeed to be fervent and hote, but in his heate ſo raſh and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rate
that often he vtters erroneous thinges and often by <hi>Mr. Iohnſon and
Daniel ſtudly</hi> hath he bene reproved and convicted of the ſame. He that
hath ſo often receyved open ſhame and rebuke for his errour is not ſo meete a

               <p>THe third reaſon which he alledgeth for the publiſhing of this treatiſe, <hi>is
in reſpect of him ſelf, having had a hand both in the tranſlating
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2643:6"/>
and printing of Mr. Britghtman his booke etc.</hi> But of this he may ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake
with ſhame enough in reſpect of his vnfaithfull dealing herein: for being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
by his maiſters that ſet him on worke to print this booke &amp; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any leave to comment vpon it or to adde his cenſures, what doth this cooſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning
companion but goes &amp; cauſeth his gloſes to be printed in the margent of
this booke? He there lets downe in oppoſition vnto Mr. Brightman, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
of him, his interrogations, his exclamations againſt him <hi>O Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
etc. O Brightman etc.</hi> Yea his citations of him vnto indgement, <hi>let
God and his angelles and all the world indge etc.</hi> And thus without the
conſent or licenſe of thoſe that employed him in their buſines, he defaces &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceth
the work committed vnto him, offendeth his maiſters, wronges the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
&amp; iniurieth the authour of the books who now ſleepeth in peace with the
Lord: But when this his deceit was found out, thoſe that were at coſt &amp; char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for the printing of this booke did then call him to account for this his bad
daaling &amp; in fine compelled him at his owne charges to take the paines to alter
and ſet over againe thoſe ſheetes of the booke which he had corrupted &amp; defaced
with his marginall gloſes &amp; then to leave out thoſe gloſes which he had before ſo
boldly &amp; deceitfully inſerted in that worke: for the evidence &amp; truth of this
matter we have both the teſtimony of thoſe that ſet him on worke, as alſo his
owne handy-work to reprove him, viz. the miſprinted ſheetes, the tokens of his
deceit, which we keep by vs for a monument of his falſhood. The truth is that
<hi>Iean Deleſcluſe</hi> did fret &amp; chafe when this rebuke was layd vpon him, but
howſoever part of his puniſhment was remitted vnto him, yet was there no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,

that Mr. Th. hath not the like care &amp; conſcience to put forah ſome ſhort writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> this inference of <hi>Deleſcluſe</hi> is vtterly falſe, for though Mr. B. ſhould

for example, it is ſayd that <hi>the Lord was angry with Iſrael</hi> in the dayes of

being at one time a true church &amp; at th' other a falſe church by the<note n="*" place="margin">R. Clift. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſw. to Mr. Sm. 154. 155. H. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſ. coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terp. pag. 7. 8.</note> confeſſion

Now it is one falſe way to be hated or loathed that the high places were reteyned

ſeparation of their aimes among them, it followes herevpon that in his account

even Iſrael in the wildernes notwithſtanding all their abhominations which the
Lord loathed were yet a true church and communion with them was lawfull, as
appeares in the example of Moſes, Ioſhua, Aaron and other faithfull ſervants of

with <hi>Mr. Iohnſon,</hi> he was then a falſe officer, that whole company being in
ſchiſme &amp; therfore a falſe church yeelding no lawfull officers; 2ly, ſuppoſe <hi>Mr.

                  <hi>THe third particular differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which he affirmeth to have bene betwixt Iſrael &amp;

affirmeth it to be partly Romiſh and partly reformed etc.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> if it be true that <hi>Mr. Robinſon</hi> writeth, viz. that the church offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,

all this idle which <hi>Deleſcluſe</hi> doth here ſpeak of their government: If the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> if that excommunication or diſſynagogueing noted <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 22.

               <p>THe fourth particular inſtance which he bringeth to prove the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Iſrael &amp; England is this: <hi>None of that church</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>were

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, it is onely the bare affirmati of <hi>Deleſcluſe</hi> that ſayth of the church of Iſrael
that none were there admitted vnto any office but onely ſuch as were lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
as Aaronwas; where is his proofe from the ſcriptures where of he boaſted
in his Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> it is a falſe affirmation of <hi>Deleſcluſe,</hi> for when Annas &amp; Caiaphas
did enterchangeably execute the high prieſtes office, as appeareth <hi>Luk. 3. 2.

               <p>Thirdly, ſeing <hi>Mr. Iohnſon</hi> hath offred to prove vnto Mr. Ainſworth &amp;

Mr. iohnſon hath ſo often entreated, provoked &amp; vrged Mr. Ainſworth therevnto
&amp; that openly in their congregation, before the rent was made: Yea beſides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the matter it ſelf, are they not ſpecially bound for their old covenant

of God have ſubmitted themſelves vnder the government and guidance of

               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> it is evident, the godly may lawfully ſubmit themſelves vnto the

                  </gap>t of the regiſter of the ſaintes, This we ſee in the
communion of the godly with the ſcribes &amp; Phariſees: And therfore if it be law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful
for Chriſtians to ſubmit themſelves vnto the counſayles, admonitions &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
of thoſe which for their ſin ought to be caſt out of the church of God &amp;
yet are vniuſtly reteyned: If a man may ſtand vnder the guidance and authority
of ſuch admonishers, ſo long as he teſtifies againſt their ſinnes, then may he alſo
ſtand vnder the government &amp; guidance of vnlawfull officers: If a man may
ſubmit himſelf vnto one who is vnlawfully a member of the church, why not alſo
vnto him who is vnlawfully a miniſter of the church? If a man may ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in private vnto the guidance of an vnlawfull brother, then why not alſo vnto
the publique guidance of an vnlawfull officer? There is more proportion betwixt
a member &amp; a miniſter then betwixt a member &amp; an excommunicate or an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
or one that ought to be excommunicate: For example, Daniel ſtudly &amp;
<hi>Iean Deleſculſe</hi> being both of them depoſed from their offices for ſin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
vnto them by the Franciſcane Browniſtes, ſuppoſe they were ſtill obſtinate
in the ſinnes imputed vnto them deſerving excommunication, &amp; yet tolerated vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lawfully,
in this eſtate being not iudged nor caſt out by their church their admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitions
for ſin either in the firſt or ſecond place were not to be reiected: And if
their private admonition might be ſubmitted vnto, why not their publique alſo
if they had not bene depoſed? If in the want of due excommunication the
private admonition of an vnlawfull member is of force &amp; to be ſubmitted vnto,
then in the want of iuſt depoſition the publique admonition or other workes of
governement exerciſed by vnlawfull miniſters is of force &amp; to be ſubmitted vnto:
This reaſon is ſpecially to be conſidred of thoſe Browniſtes that mainteyne the po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pular

               <p>Firſt, we do directly affirme that which <hi>Deleſcluſe</hi> doth ſo flatly deny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Many

Thus the ground of <hi>Deleſcluſe</hi> his argument is taken away.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> men of wiſedome may &amp; ought alſo ſometimes to commit the gui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dance

               <p>And though they were in many thinges blinde leaders,<note place="margin">2.</note> yet not ſo far as that

Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> it is no ſin of perſequution to impute blaſphemy vnto thoſe that iuſtly

                  <note place="margin">Advertiſ. pag. 15.</note>
I beſeech the Lord of his grace even with teares that he vouchſafe
to open the eyes of their moſt noble and wiſe prince that he may ſee the
iuſtice and equity of their cauſe and cavſe them to ſee his royall face and
preſence againe with ioy and gladnes of heart vnder his dominions
and iuriſdictions, Amen.</p>
               <p>In this prayer or forme of prayer,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> obſerve firſt how he diſhonours the Lord
and takes his name in vayne by praying for the manifeſtation of the iuſtice and
equity of their cauſe which is ſo full of iniuſtice and iniquitye: As Saul took
the name of God in vayne by his bleſſing the Ziphims for their ſhew of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which indeed was cruelty 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 21. So doth <hi>Deleſcluſe</hi> by bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the browniſtes for the equity of their cauſe which is indeed a meere
iniquity.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> mark here his vaine publiſhing of his owne devotion &amp; zeale, viz.
his praying with teares, yet is it no ſound commendation of himſelf while his
teares are ſpent in ſuch a cauſe: <hi>Deleſcluſe</hi> may remember ſince he was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
that many of thoſe idolatours in their ſuperſtitious devotion do often times
weepe &amp; powre forth their teares before their idolles &amp; images: As thoſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
can not iuſtify their devotion, no more can theſe teares powred forth by
<hi>Deleſcluſe</hi> for the idoll of their ſeparation iuſtify his devotion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> mark his flattery of the king calling him <hi>their moſt noble and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
prince:</hi> It is the property of true nobility to try the ſpirits of men by the
ſcripture, as the beraeans did <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. If therfore he be noble and moſt noble
they will not deny but that he hath examined their ſpirits &amp; the ſcriptures alled<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged
by them &amp; preſented vnto his maieſty in their petitions; &amp; then withall if
he be moſt wiſe how is it that he can not ſee the myſterie of their ſeparation ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their cheefe reaſons &amp; proofes layd open before him? Yea by the ſentence
of this <hi>Deleſc.</hi> there is nothing to be * expected by him from Chriſte but the
powring out of his aeternall wrath vpon him,<note place="margin">Advertiſ. pa. 9. &amp; 11</note> nothing as touching his viſible eſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te
but aeternall flames of everlaſting damnation, If this be his abiect &amp; baſe eſtate,
how is he moſt noble or moſt wiſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> we do here demand of <hi>Deleſcluſe</hi> touching this his prayer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be lawfull for any of his flock in the reading of his booke &amp; withall of
this his prayer therein to lift vp their hearts vnto the Lord, to deſire the ſame
thing &amp; to ſay Amen with him vnto this his petition: If they may not, then is
it a ſory prayer which may not be aſſented vnto by an other, &amp; then is he a ſory
guide to go before his flock in ſuch deſires as it is not lawfull for them to folow
him; but if they may pray the ſame thing with him &amp; in the reading of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

the ſeparation of the Browniſtes as ſchiſme: Do theſe churches then
practiſe and reteyne a ſeparation without their knowledge, againſt their willes
&amp; contrary to their doctrine? Or if they do thus maintaine a ſeparation not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aware thereof, ſhall this vnwitting &amp; vnwilling ſeparation be a true gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und
&amp; foundation of their church? ſhall their ignorant practiſe eſtabliſh them

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> ſuppoſe this aſſertion of his touching ſeparation were true, yet his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
therevpon is falſe, in that he ſayth <hi>and therfore this people not to
be blaſphemers:</hi> Though a man hold ſeparation yet may he be a blaſphemer
in many other reſpectes: For example, Mr. Smith holding the ſeparation of the
Browniſtes was yet a blaſphemer for that which he wrote againſt the vſe of the
tranſlated &amp; originall ſcriptures in the worſhip of God. And ſo Mr. Ihonſon
ſtill holding the ſeparation is yet by the Ainſworthians accounted a blaſphemer,
one that ſpeakes evill of the way of God, in reſpect of his new interpretation of
<hi>Mat. 18. Deleſcluſe</hi> reaſons here as though there was no blaſphemy but aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt
ſeparation, how blindely &amp; partially let the reader iudge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> he bringes yet an other falſe inference from the former aſſertion, in
ſaying, &amp; therfore this people not to be blaſphemers <hi>but true worſhippers of
God:</hi> for the former aſſertion touching ſeparation is mainteyned by Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes
yea &amp; by ſome of the Arrians, doth it herevpon follow that they are true
worſhippers of God? Nothing leſſe: Yet ſuch is the fruit of <hi>Deleſcluſe</hi> his
reaſoning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> further whereas the Browniſtes do acknowledge the dutch &amp; french
churches to be a ſeparate people &amp; true churches eſtabliſhed by ſeparation &amp; yet
condemne the read prayer vſed by them as being a falſe and idolatrous worſhip,
it may hence appeare evidently that his argument for proofe of their true worſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip
is very vaine and falſe: He may here ſee that the truth of Gods worſhip doth
not depend vpon ſeparation.</p>
