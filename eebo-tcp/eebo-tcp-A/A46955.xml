            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BEfore the Reader engages in the peruſal of this Book, I ſhall entreat him to take this following Account of what he ſhall find in it. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given as large an Account in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Book concerning <hi>Julian</hi>'s <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage of the Chriſtians, and their Behaviour towards him, as might ſatisfy any reaſonable Man, I have ſince found it neceſſary to add ſome new Matter of Fact upon that Subject, both to confirm the old, and to free it, if it be poſſible, from Wrangling and Diſpute. And that I might not deliver this freſh Matter in a way of looſe and incoherent Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which would have been tedious, I took a Hint from <hi>Gothofredus</hi> his <hi>Julianus,</hi> to put it into a Diſcourſe, which will at once give an Account of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Devices to worm the Chriſtians out of their Religion, and likewiſe ſhew how well ſtudied the Papiſts are in thoſe Arts.</p>
            <p>My Anſwerers have been ſo many, that I cannot number them on the ſudden; and I
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:66311:6"/>
think it has been Drudgery enough for one Man to read them over; but yet becauſe two of them eſpecially have been applauded as the Champions of the Cauſe, I thought my ſelf concerned to give them an Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not in the leaſt to vindicate my ſelf from their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, (which I value not, tho it were ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity not at all to reſent them) but to do what Service I could to Truth, and to the Rights of my Native Country; for either of which, if God will have it ſo, I hope I ſhall not be unwilling to lay down my Life.</p>
            <p>The Author of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> in the late ſhamming way, has ſet up a Mock-Apoſtate, to give a Diverſion, and take off the Force of what has been ſaid concerning <hi>Julian;</hi> but I hope it will prove to be with the like Succeſs as the Mock-Plots have had, which have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways confirmed Men in the Belief of the true one. He has likewiſe abuſed a great deal of Scripture, to expoſe the Freemen of <hi>England,</hi> and their eſtabliſhed Religion, to Violence, Oppreſſion, and Extirpation; and if I have reſcued thoſe Texts which he has ſo employed, from ſuch miſchievous Applications for the future, I ſhall think my Pains well ſpent.</p>
            <p>The Author of <hi>Jovian,</hi> by coming laſt, has had the Advantage of ſumming up the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which he has done ſo faithfully, that he has not omitted <hi>Heraclitus's</hi> Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:66311:6"/>
me, <hi>That I raiſe an Induction from one Particular;</hi> which he backs with as true an Obſervation of his own, <hi>That I call the few Months of</hi> Julian<hi>'s Reign an Age,</hi> p. <hi>139.</hi> I ſay this, to ſhew the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs of this Author's Performance, and that in his Anſwer we read the Subſtance of all the reſt; and not to rob him of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of having added many Things of his own, as particularly the Hiſtory of broken Succeſſion in the Empire, (which may be a true one for ought I know, for it is of ſo ſmall Concernment in this Controverſy, that I never examined it); his Outlandiſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Soveraign, which is ſuch a Deceit to a common Reader, as a Scale of Dutch Miles would be in a Map of <hi>Middleſex;</hi> and his Diſtinction of Imperial and Political Laws, which is the Maſter-Piece in his Book. This Diſtinction I am apt to think is his laſt Refuge; and therefore I ſhall, firſt, ſhew how this Author was driven to it; and, <hi>2</hi>dly, How falſe and groundleſs it is; and <hi>3</hi>dly, What are the immediate Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> In my former Book I laid down this undeniable Truth, That we are bound not to part with our Lives, but to defend them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when the Laws of God, or of our Country require us to lay them down. Now it is not
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:66311:7"/>
Death by the Law of God, but our Duty to be Proteſtants; and by the Law of the Land it is ſo far from being Death, that, on the other hand, it is Death to forſake the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and to turn Papiſt. And therefore, in caſe Proteſtants ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted under a Popiſh Succeſſor, I ask'd, by what Law they muſt die? That Queſtion would admit no direct Anſwer; for no Man can ſay, that we ought to die for being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, either by the Law of God, or the Law of the Land: And therefore the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Jovian,</hi> being reſolved to cut a Knot which he could not untie, has found out the moſt wretched Expedient of a Diſtinction that ever was: For, firſt, he ſplits and divides one and the ſame Law of the Land into <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Political;</hi> and then ſays, that by the Imperial or Prerogative Law we ought to ſubmit to be murthered.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Now in the ſecond Place, there never was a more horrid Slander caſt upon the Prerogative, than this is: For whereas the Law of <hi>England</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>of Law, Book 2. chap. 1. p. 85.</note> 
               <hi>That the King's Prerogative ſtretcheth not to the doing of any Wrong</hi>; this Author has found a way to ſtretch and extend it to the Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all the Laws, and to the Deſtruction of all his Liege Subjects. By the Law of <hi>England,</hi> the King is inviolable, and by
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:66311:7"/>
the ſame Law he can do no Wrong; and there is all the Reaſon in the World, that he who is above the doing of any Injury, ſhould be placed out of the reach of any manner of Reſiſtance. But tho the King can do no Wrong, and therefore we can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer none from him; yet to make way for Paſſive Obedience, our Author will have a ſort of Subjects, call'd the <hi>Sovereign's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> to be irreſiſtible too, tho in the moſt outragious Acts of Deſtructive Violence. That's too plain a Juggle; for as the King can do no Wrong, ſo he can authorize no ſingle Perſon, much leſs Numbers of Men, to do any Wrong: Or, to borrow the Words of a great Lawyer,<note place="margin">Ephemeris Parl. <hi>p.</hi> 146.</note> 
               <hi>The King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do Injury; for if he command to do a Man Wrong, the Command is void,</hi> &amp; alter fit Autor, <hi>and the Actor becomes the Wrong-doer.</hi> Now whether Men, by authorizing themſelves to do Miſchief, and to commit Capital Crimes, are thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to an uncontroulable Imperial Power, to the Rights of Sovereignty, and to the Prerogative of being irreſiſtible, I leave all the World to judg.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> In the laſt place, I ſhall ſhew the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Conſequences of this new Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Imperial Laws, to which we muſt pay our Paſſive Obedience. We have many
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:66311:8"/>
People amongst us, who are very much at eaſe, and wrap up themſelves in the Security of this one Conſideration, <hi>That Popery can never be eſtabliſhed in</hi> England: Which I believe to be true, provided Men may be allowed to hold their own, and to maintain thoſe Laws which eſtabliſh the Proteſtant Religion, as they are bound to do: And therefore I was perfectly of the ſame mind, till I ſaw the blind ſlaviſh Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience ſet up, and ſo induſtriouſly promoted amongst us; for <hi>that</hi> Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is Popery eſtabliſhed by a Law, when ever the Prince ſhall pleaſe. For what was Popery eſtabliſhed by a Law in Q. <hi>Mary's</hi> Time? Or what other Miſchief can Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſuffer by the Eſtabliſhment of Popery at any other time, but only to be reduced to this Choice, either to turn Papiſts, or elſe to ſubmit to be deſtroyed? Now ſo ſoon as ever a Popiſh Succeſſor ſhall give the Word, Popery is as ſurely eſtabliſhed by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Laws, as it can be by ten thouſand Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Acts of Parliament: For if we are as much bound to ſubmit, when we are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over to the Secular Arm of a Brigadeer, as when by a Writ <hi>De Haeretico comburendo,</hi> we are turned over to the Secular Arm of a Sheriff, where is the Difference? So that we may be driven to <hi>Smithfield</hi> by Droves, and
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:66311:8"/>
be piled up, and burnt, like Loads of Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, without the Trouble of repealing one Proteſtant Political Act. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Nation, a Kingdom fly, they are in a State of Damnation, according to our Author, if they will not ſubmit to this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage; and I am ſure a Popiſh Prince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Religion, is in the ſame State,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Concil. Lat. ſub <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> 3. cap. 3.</note> (to ſay nothing of the Loſs of his Kingdom) if he do not deſtroy Hereticks, as far as Fire and Sword will go.</p>
            <p>Thus far, as Proteſtants, we are beholden to this new Doctrine of Imperial Laws; and, as Engliſh Men, we ſhall ſuffer more by them, than the Nation ever did under Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery: For thoſe that will be Papiſts, ſhall not be excuſed from being Slaves, but their Lives and Liberties ſhall be wholly at the Diſcretion of their Prince. This is ſo clear a Conſequence, that our Author himſelf owns it, and ſays expreſly, <hi>p. 242.</hi> In all Sovereign Governments, Subjects muſt be <hi>Slaves</hi> as to this Particular. Whereas the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> never were Slaves in any Particular, nor ever would be, in the darkeſt Times of Popery. Beſides, I would fain know in what Particular they are Free-men, who are Slaves as to this Particular of their Lives and Liberties; I cannot but think that they muſt needs be

Slaves all over. Neither can I ſee the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our Author's <hi>muſt be Slaves;</hi> for Sovereignty in the Government, does not at all imply Slavery in the Subject in any one Particular, as I will prove to him, even in his own way, by the <hi>Notion of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign:</hi> For tho he talks much of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Eſſential Rights of Sovereignty,</hi> p. <hi>241,</hi> and in many other Places; yet I doubt not of convincing him, that the Notion of a Sovereign implies nothing in it but Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority; and as for the Terms and Meaſures of this Superiority, they muſt be known ſome other way, and are not <hi>involved in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Conception of a Sovereign,</hi> nor are all out ſo certain and demonſtrable, as the Properties of a Cube or a Sphere. For in the Law of <hi>England,</hi> every Maſter of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, for Inſtance, is a Sovereign, he is his Servants immediate Sovereign, as our Author may find it twice in one ſhort Act, <hi>12 Hen. 7. cap. 7.</hi> And a hired Servant, who is a Free-man, owes to this immediate Sovereign a <hi>natural</hi> and obliged Duty, as he may ſee in the ſame Act. And yet I am certain, our Author will not undertake to prove, that the Rights of an abſolute and arbitrary Sovereignty do belong to every Maſter of a Servant; or that that Servant is a Slave as to his Life or Liberty, either
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:66311:9"/>
by the <hi>common Laws of Sovereignty,</hi> as his Phraſe is, or by the Laws of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>And truly it is not the leaſt Aggravation of this Slavery, to be put into Chains under pretence of our Chriſtianity, which for that end muſt go under the Name of a ſuffering Religion, and be called the Doctrine of the Croſs, in ſuch a ſenſe, as if it would not ſuffer the Profeſſors of it to live. Whereas I have heretofore ſhewed, from <hi>1 Cor. 7.21, 22, 23.</hi> That Chriſtianity is ſo far from enſlaving us, or deveſting us of thoſe Rights and Priviledges which we have already, that it encourages us to procure more Liberties and Franchiſes, if we can come honeſtly by them: <hi>V. 21. But if thou mayeſt be made free, uſe it rather.</hi> It forbids Men like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to enſlave themſelves, <hi>v. 23. Ye are bought with a Price, be ye not the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Men.</hi> I might now from this place, charge all thoſe that are for the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh paſſive Obedience, with denying the Lord that bought them; as the Author of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> does me, with <hi>denying a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Crucified Saviour;</hi> or, as the Author of <hi>Jovian</hi> does, with <hi>burleſquing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Croſs:</hi> But I abhor all ſuch Abuſe of Scripture, to abuſe an Adverſary; for I know that all honeſt Men will ſooner
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:66311:10"/>
renounce an hundred ſuch ſilly Doctrines, which it may be hitherto they had no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to examine, than either renounce their Bleſſed Saviour, or any part of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But to return, it is plain therefore, that Chriſtianity does not alter Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the worſe, nor turn Free-men (as the People of <hi>England</hi> have always been) into Slaves, as to their Lives and Liberties; neither, under the pretence of Paſſive Obedience, does it give their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Eſtates into the hands of Violence, when the Law bids them keep them, and protects them in defending them. But on the other hand, it charges them, <hi>Be ye not the Servants of Men:</hi> Which indeed is a Dictate of the Law of Nature, and what Men of themſelves would obſerve, if they were not degenerate; for voluntary Slavery is a Sin againſt the Law of Nature, which no Man in his right Mind can be guilty of. And therefore the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> ſays,<note rend="inter">Manebat antequàm vinum inveniretur, omnibus incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſa libertas; nemo ſciebat a conſorte naturae ſuae obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quia ſervitutis exigere.

               </note> 
               <hi>That if there had been no Drunkenneſs, there had been no Slavery.</hi> It ſeems it was the Product of a blind drunken Bargain. And we have hitherto ſeen no better Fruits of our drunken Healths and Huzza's, but much worſe:
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:66311:10"/>
For it is a greater Sin for a Man to betray others into Slavery with him, than only to make bold with himſelf; and it is ſtill a greater Sin to betray a Truſt to do it, and to break Oaths, and be perjured, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray that Truſt; for that is making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Captives of the Devil, that they may be the Servants of Men, and enſlaving themſelves Body and Soul, to enſlave others. Good God! I what will become of us, when ſuch Wickedneſs as this ſhall dare to aſſume the Name of <hi>Loyalty!</hi> and irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Injury to the Subject, ſhall paſs for Duty to the Prince! Is not this, <hi>Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, Thou ſhalt not defraud, Be ye not the Servants of Men,</hi> as much Scripture as, <hi>Render unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the Things that are</hi> Caeſar<hi>'s?</hi> and that as much Scripture as this? Why then ſhall we ſet them at variance, and make them inconſiſtent? Why muſt one Duty drown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? or that which indeed is no Duty, drown thoſe that are? For where is it ſaid, Render unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Things which are not <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s? Where do you find that Duty, To render that which by the Law of God and Man is your own, or indeed not wholly your own, but other Mens too, with which you are entruſted: and not theirs neither, but the Children's which are yet unborn; and made
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:66311:11"/>
ſacred to them all, by the Oath of God which is upon you? It is a Madneſs, beyond that of Drunkenneſs, to do all this in a Complement. Men muſt be under ſome ſtronger Deluſions, and think there is a great deal of Merit in it, before they could be brought to do it: And therefore I believe theſe Effects are wrought by the Power of that Turkiſh Paſſive Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which enables thoſe Slaves to break their own Necks, out of profound Obedience to their <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and fills them with Conceits of going to Paradiſe for their pains. If that be ſo, what have thoſe Men done, who have ventured to adopt this Doctrine into Chriſtianity, thereby removing our old Landmarks, and undermining thoſe Banks and Walls of Engliſh Rights and Liberties, which alone, under God, could keep out Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Slavery from overflowing us. I beg of them, for the Love of God, and of their Country, and of their own Souls, and in the behalf of Poſterity, which had better never ſee the Light, than be born under Popery and Slavery, that they would ſeriouſly conſider what will be the End of theſe Things, and how they will be able to account for it; and then let them do as they ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>I muſt not omit to ſay ſomewhat to one Fallacy of our Author, which he has repeated ſo often in his Book, that perhaps he now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:66311:11"/>
it himſelf, as he would have others to do; and that is, That Self-defence does more Miſchief than the moſt outragious and bloody Oppreſſion. The Learned call that the Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Non cauſà pro causa;</hi> for Self-defence never did any Miſchief in this World; and it is impoſſible, that one Man's righting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf can do another Man wrong. The Miſchief that happens in that Caſe, is wholly to be charged upon thoſe that <hi>invade</hi> Mens Lives and Liberties, and thereby put them upon a Neceſſity of defending them. And if that Miſchief fall upon the Heads of the <hi>Invaders</hi> themſelves, it is well placed, it is their own Miſchief, which they intended for others: If by Accident it involve <hi>innocent Perſons,</hi> who were not aimed at, ſtill they are anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for it, who were the Cauſe of it. But for Men to abandon their Lives, and all their Engliſh Rights and Liberties, for fear of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Miſchief, is to throw away their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for fear of Hereſy, of which Miſchief the Scripture it ſelf is never the Cauſe, but very often the unwilling Occaſion. In a word, our Author's Doctrine of a ſlaviſh Paſſive Obedience, is an Encouragement, a Provocation, and an irreſiſtible Temptation with wicked Men, to all manner of lawleſs Oppreſſion, which is manifeſtly to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Government, <hi>and againſt
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:66311:12"/>
the King's Crown and Dignity,</hi> as the Law ſets forth ſuch Offences: Whereas the Doctrine of a juſt and neceſſary Defence, and that no Man ſhould invade or deſtroy his Fellow Subjects, but at his own Peril, has a direct Tendency to the Welfare and Preſervation of a Nation, by putting an Awe and Reſtraint upon all lawleſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Inſolence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that no Man can be offended at it, but he who would exerciſe that Cruelty, and do that Miſchief which the Law will not ſuffer him to do.</p>
            <p>As for our Author's Introduction, and other Parts of his Book, wherein he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly charges me with <hi>burleſquing the Doctrine of the Croſs,</hi> and inſinuates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a charge of Blaſphemy upon that account; I leave the Reader to judg, who brings the greater Reproach upon the Croſs of Chriſt: He that ſays, The Doctrine of the Bow-ſtring is the Doctrine of the Croſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or he that ſays and pro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, That the Doctrine of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom only is the Doctrine of the Croſs, but that the Slaviſh Doctrine of the Bow-ſtring is a miſchievous Turkiſh Doctrine, and no Evangelical Principle. But this Man would have faced down the Prophet, when be derided <hi>Baal,</hi> for a God who was hunting, or upon a Journey, or faſt aſleep, and muſt be awakened, that all that while he was blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:66311:12"/>
the Deity: For when I do the ſame as the Prophet did, by Popiſh Idolatrous Prayers, and by the miſchievous Cant of Prayers and Tears, which theſe Men employ as a Tool and an Inſtrument of Arbitrary Government and Oppreſſion; which deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive way of preſcribing and applying them, was the only Thing I called a Mountebanck Receipt, (as the Words which immediately follow in that place, <hi>chap. 2.</hi> do fully teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy) this by all means muſt be repreſented as Irreligion and Prophaneneſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing to his Libels, which are ſcattered quite through his Book againſt Perſons of ſacred Memory, of Honour, and of great Learning and Integrity; for their own Worth has given them ſo ſecure a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that it would be a ridiculous Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs in me to vindicate it: I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be inclined to bid him rail on; for tho his Reproaches are no Slanders, yet I know not what his Commendations might be.</p>

               <p>BEſides the great Gift of diſſembling in general, <hi>Julian</hi> had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of furthering his Deſigns by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending great Moderation; which St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> calls <hi>a ſhew of Gentleneſs,</hi> and <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> calls his <hi>Vizor of Meekneſs:</hi> and this he chiefly wore, in theſe two Caſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in pretending to be reconciled to thoſe that had oppoſed him, and in telling the World he could readily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give. I ſhall make choice of this Inſtance out of very many.</p>

                  </q>
But notwithanding this melting Paſſage, he that ſhall believe <hi>Julian</hi> to be the mildeſt and moſt merciful Prince that ever lived, will be groſly miſtaken. For when he ſhewed full as much Gentleneſs to <hi>Maris</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> who told him his own

very publickly, <hi>Sozomen</hi> neither imputes it to his Vertue, nor to his good Nature; but repreſents it as only a Copy of his Countenance, and a meer Amuſement. <q>The Emperor,<note place="margin">Sozom. lib. <hi>5.</hi> cap. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> ſays he, making no anſwer, paſſed it by. For he reckoned that hereby he ſhould confirm Heatheniſm the more, having ſhewed himſelf ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizingly meek and patient before a great number of Chriſtians.</q>
And that he did it out of Deſign, appears further, by taking his time to reckon with the old Biſhop afterwards.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> His Vizor of Meekneſs went on again, when there was any occaſion to ſpeak of Differences in Religion: For there he breathed nothing but Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſeem'd to have a very tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Mens Conſciences. He was not for preſſing any body againſt their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in matters of Religion, but for leaving all Men in their native Liberty, and as free as Thought. If any Man would be perſwaded to come over to his Religion, he was welcome; but he would not allow of Compulſion by any means.<note place="margin">Julian E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. <hi>52.</hi>
                  </note> And thus, by an Edict, he orders his Heathens at <hi>Boſtra</hi> to treat their <hi>Galilaean</hi> Neighbours; telling them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66311:16"/>
that Men ought to be won by Reaſon and Inſtructions, and not by beating and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling, and corporal Puniſhments. And if the <hi>Galilaeans</hi> notwithſtanding ſhould continue obſtinately in their Error, he bids them not to be angry at them for it; but to look upon them as Objects of Compaſſion, and rather to pity them, as lying in a State of Irreligion, which is the greateſt Calamity in the World. He never ſpeaks better Senſe than upon this occaſion; and when he inveighs againſt Force and Compulſion, he does it with a good Grace. And yet all this was no more then Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Court Holy-Water to the Men of <hi>Suffolk</hi>; or her compounding afterwards with the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi> in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> for the Liberty of her own Conſcience; while <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Bonner</hi> were framing quite other Arguments of Converſion, than thoſe of Reaſon and Inſtruction.</p>

for the Laws; and therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put to Death many of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and puniſhed but few of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and being accuſed for this before the Emperor; though he pleaded the Laws, according to which he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to govern, he had like to have been put to death: At laſt, obtaining Favour, he was condemned to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. And how admirable and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous was this expreſſion of <hi>Julian</hi> at that time? for ſays the juſt Judge, and no Perſecutor of Chriſtians, <hi>What great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were it if one Heathen hand had killed ten Galileans?</hi> Is not this bare-fac'd Cruelty?

Surely there never was a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Juggle of Tyranny in the World, nor more odly managed, than this of <hi>Julian:</hi> To make no Sanguinary Laws againſt the Chriſtians, becauſe he would not be thought a Perſecutor, and yet to take care that they ſhould be as effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, as if all the Laws of the Empire had been againſt them: and after that to lay open the Contrivance, and betray his own Plot!

               <p>Firſt; The Volant Squadron, that running Camp, which immediately wheels about upon the leaſt ſignal of a Change in Religion. Thoſe very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward People, who as ſoon as they knew
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66311:19"/>
how <hi>Julian</hi> ſtood affected, and what he would be at, preſently took the Hint, and were ſpecial good Heathens in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; and afterwards were immediately as good Chriſtians again, at <hi>Jovian</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. There are always ſuch Wretches as theſe in the World; who, as <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius</hi> excellently ſays, do not worſhip God, but the Purple. And as one of our own Hiſtorians ſpeaks, concerning the ſame ſort of People in the beginning of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, are ſo forward to worſhip the riſing Sun, that to make ſure work of it, they will adore the dawning Day.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> A ſort of ſimple, unthinking, and ſtupid Men; who, tho they are ſlower, are no leſs ſure than the former. They do not indeed anticipate an Alteration in Religion, but when it is made, they no more ſcruple the Prince's Religion, than they doubt whether his Coin be lawful Money. They count it their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and their Loyalty to acquieſce, and very ill manners to think themſelves wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than their betters, concluding that God and the <hi>Czar</hi> know all. Their Conſcience is, that they ought to be guided by the publick Conſcience; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66311:19"/>
they pleaſe themſelves mightily in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that if they be miſled, the fault will lye at their Door who have miſled them, and that they muſt anſwer for it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſupppoſed, If a Man out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to the Eyes of his betters, ſhould neglect to uſe his own, and run his Head againſt a Poſt, that he himſelf would have the worſt of it. <hi>Julian</hi> preſumed to find this implicit Temper chiefly in the Army, who are ſo uſed to a blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that, as St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s words are,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Some of them know no other Law, than the Will of their Prince:</hi> And accordingly he did find it, for many of them preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed their Leader, tho it were to Heatheniſm and the Worſhip of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
               <p>But, 3<hi>dly,</hi> Where he could not meet with this Stupidity and Indifferency, which makes Men ſo eaſy, that no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion comes amiſs to them, there he uſed his utmoſt Endeavour to convert them by Argument, and all the Arts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. For being a zealous Prince, he thought it meritorious to engage in the Work himſelf and not to leave it to I know not whom. And this he did partly by way of Diſcourſe and Conference, and partly by Writing.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:66311:20"/>1. By Diſcourſe and Conference. In this way, amongſt many others, he ſet upon <hi>Caeſarius</hi> his Treaſurer, <hi>Gregory Naz</hi>'s Brother, and employed a great deal of Sophiſtry in the Diſpute; but <hi>Caeſarius</hi> was too hard for him, and baffled him; and when he had done ſo, <hi>proclaimed</hi> with a loud and clear Voice,<note place="margin">Greg.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>That he was a Chriſtian, and would be a Chriſtian.</hi> And this Victory which his Brother thus gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Gregory</hi> prefers before <hi>Julian</hi>'s great Power, and noble Purple, and rich Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When he had not the opportunity of perſonal Conference, he conveyed his Arguments by writing. In one of his Letters to the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> he tells them, <q>I am aſhamed by the Gods,<note place="margin">Jul. Ep. <hi>51.</hi>
                     </note> that ſo much as one Man in <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſhould confeſs himſelf a <hi>Galilaean.</hi>
                  </q>
For this weighty Reaſon forſooth; becauſe the Hebrew Fathers of the <hi>Galilaeans</hi> had been Slaves to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had been conquered by the <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrians,</hi> and therefore it would be a ſtark ſhame for them, after all this to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves in a way of voluntary Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to the <hi>Galilaeans</hi>; who, as one may ſay, had been their Slaves Slaves. I know not what force this Argument may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66311:20"/>
have in Heraldry; but I am ſure it has none at all in Logick. He further tells them, <q>That <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Founder of their City, was a religious Worſhipper of the Gods, another-gueſs Man by <hi>Jove,</hi> than any of the <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> or any of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> before them. And ſo was <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy</hi> the Son of <hi>Lagus</hi> a better Man than any of them. And as for all the <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> they did not nurſe up their City to that Greatneſs with the Sayings of Jeſus, nor render it a well-ordered and flouriſhing City even to this day, with the Doctrine of the hateful <hi>Galilaeans.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And when it fell afterwards into the Hands of the <hi>Romans; Auguſtus</hi> expreſt great Kindneſs to it for their God <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis</hi>'s ſake.</q>
Juſt as Father <hi>Creſſy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, when he is got into the <hi>Saxon, Daniſh,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> times. And preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after you have a whole Cluſter of the Pope's own Arguments. <hi>Julian</hi> would not have them worſhip Jeſus, <q>Whom neither they, nor their Fathers have ſeen; but the great Sun, whom from all Eternity, the whole Race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind does ſee, and behold and worſhip, and by worſhipping, proſpers.</q>
Now here is the utmoſt of Antiquity, Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Succeſſion, Viſibility, and what not?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66311:21"/>
Arguments not worth the ſtooping to take up, and therefore I conceive, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worth fetching from <hi>Rome,</hi> nor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>

If his Arguments were unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and he could not get Men to apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize <hi>gratis,</hi> then he wrought upon their Covetouſneſs and Ambition; for amongſt too many, a very bad Religion, with Money or Honour to boot, is reckoned a great Bargain. And in this Field it was that <hi>Julian</hi> conquered, as St. <hi>Aſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Hom. Cont. Avarit. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blioth. Pat.

                  <q>What drew thoſe who had been Chriſtians and Communicants to the Worſhip of Devils? Was it not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of great Poſſeſſions, and to be Lords of other Men's Eſtates? who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received Promiſes from wicked Heathens, of being Governours as long as they lived, or of having large Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of the King's Treaſury, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhifted their Religion like a Garment. We have ſome Inſtances of theſe things from former times, and our own Age has given us the Experience of others. For when that Emperour, who of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den laid down the Maſque of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, impudently fell to ſacrificing to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils himſelf, and propounded many Advantages to them that would do ſo

too, how many were there who left the Church and ran to the Altars? How many catching at the Bait of Honours, ſwallowed the Hook of Apaſtacy toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him? But now they go up and down the Cities as ſtigmatized Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hated and pointed at by all: Look, theſe are the Betrayers of Chriſt for a little Money; they are put out of the Catalogue of Chriſtians, as <hi>Judas</hi> was out of the number of the Apoſtles, and are as well known by their Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Apoſtate, as Horſes are known by their Brands:<note place="margin">

                  </q>
As St. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Words are, <q>Some he drew with Money, others with Dignities, others with Promiſes, others with Honours of all ſorts, which he expoſed in all Men's ſight, not like a King, but in a very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile manner.</q>
Which made that honeſt Clergy-man, <hi>Baſilius,</hi> take a great deal of neceſſary Pains, to fortify the Chriſtians againſt that Temptation, by warning them not to part with their Religion upon thoſe wretched Terms.<note place="margin">Sozom. lib. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q>When <hi>Julian</hi> was Emperour, ſays the Hiſtorian, <hi>He</hi> went all up and down, publickly and openly exhorting the Chriſtians to ſtick faſt to their Religion, and not to be defiled with the Sacrifices and Libations
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66311:22"/>
of the Heathens, and that they ſhould reckon for nothing the Honours which were beſtowed by the Emperour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that they were but for a Seaſon, in reſpect of the Wages of eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Making this his Buſineſs, he was hated by the Heathens: and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and looking upon them as they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſacrificed, he fetch'd a deep Groan and prayed, that no Chriſtian might ever know by Experience that falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Upon this he was apprehended and delivered to the Governour, and after ſeveral Torments, manfully finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Martyrdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot but obſerve, that both St. <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> make mention of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s tempting Men by Promiſes, which was a cheap way of corrupting great Numbers. For (as the Cardinal advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Gentleman, who told him that he intended him the preſent of a very fine Horſe, but he unhappily fell lame by the way. Go, ſays his Eminency, to ſuch and ſuch, naming half a dozen other Cardinals, and tell every one of them the very ſame Story; and you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige more with your lame Horſe, than if he had come well to Town). It is plain that one ſingle Preferment in this way,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66311:22"/>
is capable of engaging a multitude of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants. O baſe and low-priz'd Souls in the mean time! which once could not be redeemed with Silver and Gold, but are now bought with the very chincking of Money in one's hand. It is no marvel therefore, that immediately after <hi>Julian</hi>'s Death, theſe Men became a publick Scorn, and were as vile in all Men's Eyes, as Cattel that been ſold in a Market, and wore their Maſter's Brand upon them.<note place="margin">

               <head>CHAP. VIII. His Edicts.</head>
               <p>I Come now to his Laws, ſome of which ſeem at the firſt ſight to be light and frivolous, and yet carry a Sting with them; whereby they were the fitter for <hi>Julian</hi>'s purpoſe, which was to do the Chriſtians what Miſchief he could, with as little noiſe as he could. His firſt Edict commanded that the Chriſtians ſhould be called <hi>Galilaeans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Invect.</hi> 1. p. 81, 82.</note> 
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> indeed looks upon this as a ridiculous Law, and rather like a childiſh or waggiſh Conceit than an Edict, and ſo all wiſe Men will account it, and yet withall it was a very popular way of diſgracing the Chriſtians, and conſequently of weakening and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. For every body knows that ſo much Reputation is ſo much Power, which is like to be little enough, when Men are once made a publick Scorn. By this Device <hi>Julian</hi> both aſſaulted the Conſtancy of weaker Chriſtians, who cannot all of them digeſt Reproaches, and deſpiſe the Shame as their great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter did; and likewiſe laid a great Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block in the way of all Converts to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66311:28"/>
Chriſtianity. For a reproachful Name is the ſame with the Diſguiſe of an ill Dreſs, which is always to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of him that wears it. This the Popiſh Inquiſitors underſtand very well, no Men in the World better, when they clap a <hi>Sanbenit</hi> upon the Back of a poor condemn'd Heretick, to make the People believe, the Wretch has as many Devils within him, as they ſee there pictured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Frock. And in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days the like courſe was taken to run down the Proteſtants with reproachful Names. Their religious Aſſemblies were by Law called <hi>Conventicles,</hi> their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer Fantaſtical and Schiſmatical Services, and themſelves Hereticks, which of the two is a worſe name than <hi>Galilae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> for it implies all thoſe Devils, which the <hi>Sanbenit</hi> repreſents, and is indeed but another unbleſt Coat to burn Men in.</p>
               <p>His next Edict prohibited Chriſtians from being Schoolmaſters and Tutors, and having the education of Youth: which was a great temptation to the Learned Men amongſt them to turn Heathens for a Livelihood: but if he failed in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as for the moſt part he did, this was nevertheleſs a ſure way to keep the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians low and ignorant, and at length
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66311:29"/>
to bring darkneſs upon the face of the Church. One <hi>Prooereſius</hi> indeed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Edict, had the liberty given him by <hi>Julian</hi> to continue in his Profeſſion; but he generouſly refuſed it, and would not receive the Favour at his hands: For which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> has Chronicled him, to his immortal Honour. <q>

This was the temper of thoſe Chriſtians; they were ſo far from courting an Enemy to their Religion, that they ſcorn'd the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Favours which he offered them: and for doing the contrary, as I have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> carried a Brand of Infamy along with them for ſome Generations.<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.

               <p>NOne of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Laws drew Blood, unleſs it were in the forcible and barbarous execution of them; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was it his buſineſs to make Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Laws againſt the Chriſtians, and to deſtroy them fairly, (which he might have done with a daſh of his Pen, and with as much eaſe as he could ſpeak or write) for then he had proclaimed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Perſecutor, and them Martyrs, which was an Honour,<note place="margin">Orat. <hi>10.</hi> in Caeſar. p. <hi>167.</hi>
                  </note> ſays <hi>Gregory,</hi> which the Gentleman envied the Chriſtians. It was therefore more agreeable to his treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Malice, to do the thing, and not to be ſeen in it, and to put the Chriſtians to Death, not as Martyrs, but as unpitied Malefactors. In order to this, he twiſted Heatheniſm ſo artificially with the legal expreſſions of their Loyalty and Duty, that it was impoſſible to ſeparate them; but they muſt of neceſſity either offend againſt the Laws of God, or the Laws of the Empire.<note place="margin">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66311:31"/>
joining the Figures of the Heathen Gods with his own, that the poor Chriſtians were reduced to this ſtrait; either to rob God or the Emperour of his Honour; and either to ſin as Idolaters, or ſuffer as Traitors. But all the good Chriſtians of that Age determining their Choice to the latter of theſe two, have thereby taught us, that our Duty to Man ceaſes, when it becomes inconſiſtent with our Duty to God; and that when our Religion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, we muſt beg our Temporal Lord's excuſe, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s diſtinction is.<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſal. <hi>124.</hi>
                  </note> Thoſe Chriſtians never valued themſelves upon a falſe and hairbrain'd Loyalty to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of their Religion; but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, they would not render unto Ceſar the things which were Ceſars, when in ſo doing, they muſt of neceſſity alienate from God the things which were God's: when they found <hi>Julian</hi> in company with Heathen Gods, and when he had inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably interwoven his own lawful Rights with Idolatry and with the Worſhip of thoſe falſe Gods.</p>
               <p>In this place it will not be improper to mention an other device of his, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he mingled Heatheniſm, not as before with the Laws of the Empire, but with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66311:32"/>
the more rigorous Laws of Nature <q>For, as <hi>Theoderet</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Theod. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>14.</hi>
                     </note> he defiled the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that were in <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Daphne</hi> with impure Sacrifices, that every one who uſed the Water might take part of the Abomination. Afterwards he filled with pollution all things that were to be ſold in the Market: for the Bread, and Meat, and Fruits, and Herbs, and all other things that were to be eaten, were ſprinkled with Holy-Water. They that were called by the name of our Saviour, ſeeing theſe things, groaned indeed and made lamentation, deteſting what was done: but withal they eat of them, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtle's Law, for ſays he, <hi>all that is ſold in the Shambles, eat, making no difference for Conſcience ſake.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Julian,</hi> no doubt, by this barbarous act, intended either to ſtarve the Chriſtians out of their Religion, or at leaſt to perplex them, and to render their lives uncomfortable. For how great an affliction this was to the Chriſtians, and how much they laid it to Heart, appears by this inſtance which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows. <q>There were two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of no mean account in <hi>Julian</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> for they bore Shields, and were of the Emperour's Lifeguard, who, being at a Feaſt, did more bitterly bewail the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66311:32"/>
of thoſe things that were done, and made uſe of the admirable expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the young Men that behav'd themſelves ſo bravely in <hi>Babylon; For thou haſt delivered us,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Emperour, an Apoſtate beyond all the Nations of the Earth.</hi> Some body that ſat at the ſame Table informed againſt them: whereupon <hi>Julian</hi> preſently has theſe brave Men brought before him, and askt them what they had ſaid? They taking the Emperour's queſtion for an occaſion of ſpeaking freely, whetting a Zeal which was praiſeworthy, ſaid after this manner: <hi>O King we having been bin bred up in the true Religion, and having lived under the commendable Laws of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine <hi>and his Sons, are grieved to ſee all things now filled with abomination, and our meat and drink defiled with accurſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. We have lamented theſe things at home, and do now bewail them in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. This is the only grievance we bave under thy Government.</hi> The moſt meek Perſon, and the moſt a Philoſopher (for ſo he was called by thoſe that were like himſelf) <hi>laid by</hi> his Vizor of Clemency, and ſhewed a bare face of impiety: and ordering them to be grievouſly uſed, he deprived them of this preſent life; or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66311:33"/>
rather he delivered them from thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous times, and procured them the Crowns of Conquerours. And he fitted an accuſation to anſwer to their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for he did not charge them with their Religion, upon account of which they were cut off, but with ill language; for he ſaid they were puniſhed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling the Emperour. He commanded this Accuſation to be publiſhed abroad, envying the Champions of Truth the title and honour of Martyrs. Their names were <hi>Juventius</hi> and <hi>Maximus.</hi> The City of <hi>Antioch</hi> honouring theſe Men as Champions of the true Religion, laid them up in a coſtly Tomb, and to this day they are honoured with an anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Holiday.</q>
Now this was right <hi>Julian,</hi> to give publick order that the Chriſtians ſhould not be forced to ſacrifice againſt their wills, and yet to find out ſuch indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ways of cramming his Heatheniſm down their Throats.</p>

Thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who had notice before-hand of this contrivance, found excuſes to abſent themſelves; but the others who knew nothing at all of it, were miſerably caught. For, firſt of all, they had no time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider or delibrate whether it were lawful to throw this Frankincenſe on the Altar or no, and were plainly hurried to it: there was the ſight of their Money to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all ſuch troubleſome ſcruples; and

the Emperour looking on to over-awe them: and there was a very probable ſhew and appearance (as <hi>Gregory</hi>'s words are) that this was the Law of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Donative, at leaſt in the more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and honourable way. But when theſe unhappy Men came afterwards to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what they had done, and were made ſenſible that they had Sacrificed, and in effect renounced Chriſt, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed one of the ſaddeſt Scenes that ever the World ſaw. For they preſently broke out into the moſt doleful lamentations,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and fell to tearing their Hair off their Heads, and ran up and down the Market-place, recanting what they had done, and crying out, <hi>they were Chriſtians,</hi> and that they were over-reach't and decieved by the Emperour's Wiles. With theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries they went to Court, exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fallacies and Juggles of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: they threw him back his Money, as <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us, and deſired to be burnt, out of indignation againſt themſelves for what they had done; that being pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one Fire, they might be purged by another. Theſe and the like words made <hi>Julian</hi> mad; who thereupon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to be beheaded: but when they were at the place of Execution, and

               <head>CHAP. X. His turning innocent actions into crimes.</head>
               <p>I Am come now to the laſt and moſt effectual means, which <hi>Julian</hi> uſed, of deſtroying the Chriſtians; and that is in one word, by turning the moſt innocent, lawful, and commendable actions of their whole lives into capital Crimes. As <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> ſays, <q>It was his device and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance that we ſhould not ſo much as have the honour,<note place="margin">Orat. <hi>10.</hi> in Caeſar. p. <hi>167</hi>
                     </note> which belonged to the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66311:35"/>
combats of Martyrdom (for the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man envied the Chriſtians that) and he ordered it ſo, that thoſe who ſuffered for their Chriſtianity, ſhould be puniſhed as evil doers.</q>
And truly there was no need for <hi>Julian</hi> to take upon him the odium and diſgrace of putting Chriſtians to death for their Religion, contrary to his publick and repeated Declarations, which promiſed them all ſecurity, when he had more plauſible Pretences at hand, and might execute them as Sacrilegious Wretches; and ſo cut off both their Lives and Reputations at one blow. It's true, if the Chriſtians had been really guilty of Sacrilege, their blood had been upon their own heads, and they had died juſtly; but there was nothing at all of that, it was all Sham, and Juggle, and Pretence.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſtianity, he preſently learn'd it was his duty to ſuppreſs Idolatry, in which he proceeded very far; in ſome places deſtroying Temples, in ſome places again only ſhutting them up, and for the moſt part taking out the Images, and ſpoiling them of their Religion, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſerve for common and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Statues. His Son <hi>Conſtantius</hi> went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66311:35"/>
in deſtroying theſe Neſts and Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Idolatry, and gave the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Authority to pull down Temples, and build Churches in the place of them; to throw down Altars, and break Images in pieces; and ſo, as far as it was poſſible, to drive Heatheniſm and root the memorial of it out of the World. Inſtead of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Proofs which I could produce, I ſhall give you this one clear Teſtimony, that the Chriſtians were impowred to do this: <hi>Gregory,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Marcus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> has theſe words;<note place="margin">

                  <q>This Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Reign of the famous <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> in purſuance of that Authority which was then given to the Chriſtians, deſtroyed a certain Houſe of Devils, and built a Church in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julian</hi> afterwards comming in an ill hour to the Throne, and profeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Pagan, gave order to have the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples opened, the Gods worſhipt, and Fires to be new kindled upon the Altars. But, alas, the Heathens in ſome places had no Temples to open, in others their Gods were flown, and their Altars demoliſh'd. Hereupon they revenge the quarrel of their Gods, as <hi>Julian</hi> words it, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly murder, and more barbarouſly torture thoſe who had been moſt active
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66311:36"/>
in making havock of their Idols. This way of proceeding would not do every where, and might be of ill conſequence where the Chriſtians were too many for the Heathens; and therefore <hi>Julian</hi> has this further fetch, he reckons with the Chriſtians for Sacrilege, and fairly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches them by Law. As St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Hom. de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. &amp; Max.</note>
                  <q>If any one in former times, when Godly Kings had the Government, had either broken their Altars, thrown down their Temples, taken away their Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or done any ſuch thing, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently hurried away to the Tribunal: and ſometimes the innocent were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, when they were barely accuſed.</q>
The Innocent, that is, thoſe that never did the matter of Fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t: for it is plain that none of them were guilty of Sacrilege. What ſtealing or pilfering of holy things could that be, when they publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed things deteſtable, and devoted to deſtruction, and were armed with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſo to do? But if <hi>Julian</hi>'s Judges were minded to ſay Ears were Horns, who could help it? And I doubt not but the Papiſts, when time ſerves, can frame as good an Inditement of Sacriledg againſt thoſe, who have reformed their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous glaſs Windows, or burnt Crucifixes,

               <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks as if very great numbers of the Chriſtians had Suffered for Sacrilege, and by this ſingle paſſage it will appear, with what Infamy they fell, and under what Character they ſtand recorded in Hiſtory. <q>At the ſame time, ſays the Hiſtorian, <hi>Artemius,</hi>

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:66311:37"/>So much for Sacrilege. At another time Treaſon or Rebellion is the Word, and then the Chriſtians go to wrack for that. <hi>Juventinus</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> as we have ſeen before, fell under that accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <head>AN ANSWER TO <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Apoſtate.</head>
            <p>IT would be endleſs to confute the groſs Errors and wilful Miſtakes of which this Book is, for the moſt part, compoſed; and therefore I ſhall think it ſufficient to ſhew that the deſign of the whole is nothing but Fraud and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; wherein a Chriſtian Emperour is made an Apoſtate, and worſe than he was, only to render the Chriſtians that lived under him the more eminently paſſive. Which may be done, by ſhewing theſe two things. Firſt, That this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has not given a true Character of <hi>Conſtantius:</hi> Nor ſecondly, Of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that lived under him.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:66311:39"/>1. This Author has not given a true Character of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> nor indeed has he taken the way to do it. For firſt, He takes a great part of that Character out of <hi>Ammianus,</hi> a bigot Heathen, who had a <hi>Hero</hi> of his own to ſet off, by the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing and black Strokes which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Jovian</hi>: Which is much the ſame, as if a Man ſhould write the Life of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> out of the Memoires of the Jeſuits. 2. He imputes to <hi>Conſtantius</hi> all thoſe Cruelties, which were acted during his long Reign by any of the <hi>Arians,</hi> though I am ſure, he cannot prove that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> any way encouraged very many of them. For on the other hand, when he found his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority had been abuſed to miſchievous purpoſes, he would never forgive it in his greateſt Favourites, as I might inſtance in <hi>Macedonius,</hi> for whom upon ſuch an occaſion he had an Averſion ever after. Now if you draw together all the ill Humours which are diſperſed in a Man's whole Body and make them ſettle in his Face, it will certainly make him look ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ugly. I grant, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had Faults, but withall they are not ſo much to be imputed to any wilfulneſs in him as to his Weakneſs, which was continually wrought
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66311:39"/>
upon by ſome ſubtile <hi>Arians</hi> which were about him, to the Diſturbance of the Church. However take him with all his Faults, and ſtill he is a Saint to <hi>Julian</hi>; and ſo the Fathers make him, when they mention both at the ſame time. When they had an Apoſtate in earneſt, then <hi>Cappa</hi> had never done them any wrong,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jul. Miſop.</hi> p. 89. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> and then they wiſh'd for him again. And <hi>Theodoret</hi> gives a very fair account of him, and repreſents him as a Prince who had a great ſenſe of Religion, giving this for an Inſtance, That he cauſed his whole Army in one of his Expeditions to receive the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and would not allow any Souldier to ſtay with him, who would not put himſelf into that good Poſture and Preparation for Death. 'Tis true, he dealt hardly with ſeveral Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Biſhops, and oppreſt them contrary to Law or Equity, particularly <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and the other baniſh'd Biſhops; and I muſt grant this to be true for their ſakes. For otherwiſe there never was ſuch a ſort of Paſſive Subjects in the World, and they would be ten times worſe than this Author has made <hi>Conſtantius</hi>; and even as they are, I deſire this Gentleman and Mr. <hi>Long</hi> to take notice that I diſclaim them, and do by no means propound them
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66311:40"/>
as Examples, but ſhall ſet down their Words as matter of Fact only. And with this neceſſary Proviſo, that the Sayings of their own Holy Fathers may not be treacherouſly turn'd upon me, as Mr. <hi>Long</hi> knows one of <hi>Sozomen</hi>'s has been, I come to the</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d</hi> Thing; That this Author has not given a true Character of the Fathers under <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> He tells us, <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. <hi>The Conduct of all the Fathers that lived under</hi> Conſtantius <hi>was ſuch, that all the Cruelties which that Apoſtate Emperour could inflict, did not extort the leaſt miſ-becoming Expreſſion from them.</hi> And Pag. 37. <hi>All their heavy Grievances did not make them remonſtrate to the Decrees of their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; they did not make their Preſſures juſt, by impatiently ſubmitting to them.</hi> In ſhort, a diſcovery of the Paſſive Obedience of theſe Fathers, was the glorious end of his Book, as that Obedience he elſe-where tells us,<note place="margin">Epiſt. dedic.</note> is the <hi>glorious End of Religion</hi>; and had it not been for this, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had never been made an Apoſtate.</p>
            <p>There were about half a dozen Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Biſhops who ſuffered Baniſhment; for I will not reckon Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> nor <hi>Hoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> into the number, as our Author does, becauſe they both ſubſcribed Hereſie. Of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66311:40"/>
all theſe there are but three that I know of, whoſe Writings have come down to us, and they are St. <hi>Hillary, Lucifer Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanus,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi>; ſome of whoſe Expreſſions I ſhall here ſet down, and leave it to our Author to juſtify that they were not miſbecoming.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with St. <hi>Hillary,</hi> who has a little Book intituled, <hi>Contra Conſtantium Auguſtum,</hi> written in the Emperour's life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, notwithſtanding the falſe Title which is now clap'd upon it (for it was written a Year before <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s Death, as appears by the Book it ſelf) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he calls <hi>Conſtantius Antichriſt,</hi> tells him,<note place="margin">

               <hi>He is the crueleſt and wickedeſt of all Men, for he was ſuch a Perſecutor as deprived thoſe that fell of Pardon and Forgiveneſs, and thoſe that ſtuck to their Religion of the Honour of Martyrdom: But your Father the Devil,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Hillary, taught you this way of perſecuting.</hi> And preſently after he accoſts him thus, <hi>Thou ravening Wolf, we ſee thy Sheeps clothing.

            <p>The next is <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus,</hi> of whom St. <hi>Jerome</hi> gives this account.<note place="margin">Jerom. Cat. Eccleſ <hi>Writers.</hi>

There is no one Book of <hi>Lucifer</hi> which bears that Title, but all his little Tracts being directed to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and written againſt him, St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> calls them all one <hi>Book,</hi> and ſo does <hi>Florentius</hi> and <hi>Lucifer</hi> himſelf, whereas <hi>Athanaſius</hi> calls them <hi>Books</hi>; which Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety is uſual amongſt the Antients, as <hi>Jerome</hi> calls <hi>Gregory</hi>'s two Invectives a

               <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> hearing of this Book ſent to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> deſires <hi>Lucifer</hi> to ſend him a Copy of it in theſe words:<note place="margin">

Which accordingly he did ſend him.</p>
            <p>And now this Book is in good hands: for the great <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who has been miſled by flying report to think well of it, when he comes to examine it, and finds it ſo contrary to the Evangelical Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience, and to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Practice of <hi>nè verbo quidem relucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> which was, not to reſiſt ſo much as with a word ſpeaking, and of ſo different a ſtamp from ſome of his own ſmooth and ſoft Sayings to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> can do no leſs then anathematize it, or write a Book againſt it. And yet never truſt me more, if he and all his Confeſſors do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud and magnify it beyond all that I have ſaid of the Homilies. <q>We have received your Letter,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Well, having gotten ſuch an infallible Interpreter of Scripture as we cannot meet with every day, if his Voucher ſay true, let us ſee what he ſays concerning that Paſſage of <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. with which <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had rubb'd him up for his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards him, and had ſaid, that it was the Office of a Biſhop according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 178. D addo illud, quod illorum Principum &amp; magiſtratuum Apoſtolus fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerit mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66311:44"/>
That the Apoſtle ſpoke of thoſe Princes and Magiſtrates, who as yet had not believed in the only Son of God, that they by our Humility, and Meekneſs, and ſuffering long under Adverſity, and all poſſible Obedience in things fitting, might be won over to Chriſtianity. But if you, becauſe you are Emperour, feigning your ſelf to be one of us, ſhall force us to forſake God, and imbrace Idolatry; what, muſt we quietly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to you, for fear of ſeeming to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Apoſtles Precepts?</q>
Does not he tell you as plainly as ever <hi>Plowden</hi> did, that the caſe was alter'd?</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe this <hi>Lucifer</hi> had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards died in a Ditch, as he did not, but in his own See, and in the Communion of the Catholick Church; or ſuppoſe he had afterwards been a Schiſmatick, as he was not, but only ſome of his Friends, who too far eſpouſed his ſevere Opinion againſt re-admitting the <hi>Arian</hi> Clergy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Communion of the Church; yet this would not have affected his Book; eſpecially ſince the great <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who before now, has been ballanced againſt the whole World, has laid his hand upon it, and given it his Bleſſing, and made it his own by undertaking ſo largely for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66311:45"/>
it. But as I ſaid before, I have no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Uſe to make of theſe Fathers Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which I have here cited, than only to ſhew that they run in quite another ſtrain than the Apologies of the Fathers, who lived before the Eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity, and that they are a compleat Anſwer to <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Apoſtate. Tho I could name other excellent Uſes which might be made of them; particularly by thoſe, who think themſelves concern'd to ſtuff out their Sermons with <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Sayings.</hi> For here they might have them in abundance, and by Cluſters, without the trouble of gleaning them in Sermons, which were made in the Heat of a flaming unnatural War (when bloody things were done as well as ſaid on both ſides); and here likewiſe they might have ſuch as might be repeated without the Breach of the Act of Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without renewing ſuch miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Heats amongſt Proteſtants, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards produced thoſe <hi>Sayings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus defeated the chief purpoſe and main deſign of this Gentleman's Book, I ſhall give the Reader two or three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of what ſorry Materials his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my Book conſiſts, which he had interwoven with every Chapter, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66311:45"/>
which if you pleaſe, you may call the under-plot of his Farce.</p>
            <p>The ſtrength of his ſecond Chapter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Succeſſion, lies in this paſſage, p. 13. <hi>That the Chriſtians in</hi> Julian<hi>'s time were not for Excluſion upon the ſcore of Religion: For not two years after</hi> Julian's <hi>death,</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens <hi>a furious Arian, and bitter perſecutor of thoſe that diſſented from him, was peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully admitted to the Empire, and aſſiſted too by the Army; whom we cannot think in the leaſt inclined to favour that Hereſie (for they were</hi> Jovinians <hi>Souldiers) but they knew their duty to their Prince.</hi> Now this is inexcuſeable prevarication; for he knows, when <hi>Valens</hi> was admitted Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he was neither furious <hi>Arian,</hi> nor any <hi>Arian</hi> at all; nor like to be a Perſecutor of the Orthodox, for he was one of them himſelf, and ſo continued for a good while after. <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s words are theſe: <q>
                  <hi>Valentinian</hi> ſending for his Brother out of <hi>Paeonia,</hi>

And a conſiderable time after, <hi>cap.</hi> 11. he gives an account of his turning <hi>Arian.</hi> Upon which Conſideration, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> looks upon his being made Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66311:46"/>
as an ill day's Work, and what his own Brother ought not to have done.</p>
            <p>Again; he has a pleaſant Diſtinction, which I doubt not gives the intelligent Reader as good divertiſement, as an Aſſe's mumbling Thiſtles gave the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. Theodoret <hi>he finds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the</hi> Antiochians <hi>for their Zeal, but not for their Rudeneſs:</hi> Whereas what he calls <hi>Rudeneſs; Theodoret</hi> in that place, makes the only Inſtance of their <hi>Zeal.</hi> And <hi>Pag.</hi> 23. he ſays, <hi>Valentinian</hi> had the Empire, <hi>not for ſtriking the Prieſt,</hi> but for his Confeſſion: whereas his ſtriking the Prieſt, in Deteſtation of that holy Water wherewith he had ſprinkled him, was his Confeſſion, and he ſuffered his Impriſonment upon that account; and when <hi>Theodoret</hi> comes to give a Relation of his being elected Emperour,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 25.</note>) <hi>they were repeated with</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid<hi>'s Spirit.</hi> But why were not the ſame Pſalms repeated with <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit the day before, by the whole Church of <hi>Antioch?</hi> why were not <hi>Publia</hi>'s Pſalms repeated with the ſame Spirit? Why not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66311:46"/>
               <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? For all theſe were taken out of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and no looker-on can tell but that they were accompanied with his Spirit. However if they were not, it was their fault, who ſpoil'd good Scripture for want of Devotion, and a ſuitable frame of Spirit.</p>
            <p>To conclude, he tells us, <hi>Pag.</hi> 32. <hi>That</hi> Conſtantius <hi>might kill</hi> Julian <hi>as a Rebel, and ſo his Right would fall of courſe, but he could not diſinherit him as ſuch, becauſe God, tho he gave the Power of Life and Death to the Magiſtrate, hath yet reſerved the diſpoſing of Kingdoms to himſelf.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any Cauſe bleſt with ſuch ſubtile Advocates! They contend that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate cannot diſinherit, and yet in the ſame Breath they grant he can do that and ten times more; he cannot diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit directly, and yet he can do it moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually by the by; he cannot diſpoſe of a Man's Fortune, but he can diſpoſe of his Life and Fortune both: and their reaſon is, <hi>becauſe God hath reſerved the diſpoſing of Kingdoms to himſelf.</hi> But does not this Excluſion by the by more effectually diſpoſe of a Kingdom than
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66311:47"/>
a Bill of Excluſion? He that ſtands only excluded, has ſtill a Chance for it; but he that is diſabled in this other way, can have none; there is no ſuch Bar as that. In a word, the Power of Life and Death does manifeſtly over-rule all Reverſions, and it is a Truth of Mathematical Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, That the longeſt Liver will have all.</p>

               <p>I Come now to the laſt Chapter of this Author, which begins with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the Behaviour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi>'s Chriſtians, of which he has brought in a very falſe reckoning, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down Paſſive Obedience for the Sum-Total of the Account; for it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that S. <hi>Hilary, Lucifer,</hi> and <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> were not the moſt obedient Wretches that ever lived; but could make ſhift to uſe (what our Author calls it) <hi>their Chriſtian Liberty</hi> in Latine, as well as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s Chriſtians uſed it in Greek.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66311:47"/>
of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Chriſtians, namely, that they were illegally oppreſt, is unanſwerable. For it is matter of Fact that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were under the Protection of the Laws; their Religion ſtood unrepealed, though Heatheniſm was revived; nay, they were under the Protection of <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s own Edicts;<note place="margin">Jul.

And tho our late blundering Tranſcribers have not obſerved the different State of Chriſtians, when they had the Laws againſt them, and when they had the Laws for them, nor their different Behaviour thereupon; yet learned Men in former times have, particularly <hi>Robert Abbot,</hi> the learned Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in theſe words.<note place="margin">Dem.

with Religions Pretences; and to that purpoſe have quoted Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Modern Divines, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in abundance, which puts me in mind of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Theater, as Biſhop <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> tells the Story.<note place="margin">Bp <hi>Jewel</hi>'s Serm. <hi>p.</hi> 190.</note>
                  <q>There was ſometime a Proclamation made in <hi>Rome,</hi> that for Conſiderations no Man ſhould erect or build up any Theater, and that if any were ſet up it ſhould be razed and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down. <hi>Pompeius</hi> built a Theater, contrary to the Proclamation and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before taken; but doubting leſt the next Magiſtrates ſhould deſtroy it, he cauſed a place of Religion to be ſet upon it, and called it the Temple of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>; whereby he provided, that if any would overthrow it becauſe it was a Theater, they might yet ſpare it for the Temple's ſake; for to pull down a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was Sacriledg.</q>
The very ſame courſe is now taken by theſe Men, to erect their new frame of Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Arbitrary Government, call it which you will, (for whether another has right to my Goods, or if he demand them I have no right to keep them, it is all one; whether he has a right of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bow-ſtring, or if he ſend it, I have no right to refuſe it, they both come to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66311:49"/>
the ſame rekoning). It is prohibited by Law, and therefore the Law would quickly pluck it down; but to prevent that, they clap a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> upon it, and ſo the prohibited Theater takes Sanctuary in the Church. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavour to ſpoil it of all its Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Pretences, and ſo leave it to the Law, which knows what to do with a common Nuiſance.</p>
               <p>Theſe Religious Pretences, are, firſt, The Doctrine of the Ancient Fathers. As for what the Fathers ſay, who lived in the old World before the eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity, it does my <hi>Anſwerers</hi> no ſervice at all, becauſe it is all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and does not concern the preſent Caſe. And as for Quotations ſince <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>'s time, I think I am not in their debt. Which Quotations of mine make the more againſt this Paſſive Doctrine; becauſe the Fathers all along lived under a more abſolute and arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in which Caſe, Men are very apt to take up ſlaviſh Principles, as we ſee it in our Neighbours the <hi>French.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Fathers had breathed nothing but Bondage and abſolute Subjection, I could eaſily have accounted for it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66311:49"/>
their <hi>Diſſenters Sayings</hi> can never be ſolved by all the Paſſive Doctors in the World, But muſt remain unaccountable for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly; The next Religious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are the Doctrine of the Homilies, and of our eminent Divines, ſuch as Bp. <hi>Jewel,</hi> Bp <hi>Bilſon, &amp;c.</hi> wherein I very much wonder at the Confidence of theſe Men; for any Man that has read the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Writings of our firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, or indeed any thing of the Hiſtory of that Age wherein they lived, will as ſoon be perſwaded to believe that they were a ſort of Men who went upon their heads inſtead of their feet, as that they were for this new-faſhion'd Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>For, 1. The Homilies of Obedience do no-where teach Submiſſion to Lawleſs Violence, but only to Lawful Authority; and never require us to ſuffer wrongs and injuries patiently, but expreſly in <hi>ſuch caſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 74 <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with</hi> Pag. 72.</note> and in <hi>that caſe,</hi> when the Laws are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; and in a word, they direct all our Obedience and Submiſſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Authority, for they conclude:<note place="margin">Pag. 77.</note>
                  <q>Thus we know partly our bounden Duties to common Authority, now let us learn to accompliſh the ſame.</q>
And the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66311:50"/>
of <hi>Jovian</hi> is grievouſly out, <hi>pag.</hi> 226. when he makes as if the Subjects of this Realm could ſuffer no Injury nor Wrong, but in a way of lawleſs Oppreſſion. For did not Queen <hi>Mary</hi> wrong and injure both the <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and all other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, when ſhe burnt them alive for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proteſtants, tho ſhe burnt them by a Law? And was ſhe not a Wrong-doer, and did ſhe not abuſe her Power in revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that wicked Law? For whithout that Law, ſhe had had no Power at all to burn them; and if it had been done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Law, it had not been done by an <hi>abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Power,</hi> but by one aſſum'd and uſurp'd.</p>
               <p>And then as for the Homilies againſt Rebellion (which is reſiſting or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding common Authority,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 75.</note> as the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Obedience defines it) they ſpeak not one word of lying down, and ſubmitting to unauthoritative and lawleſs Violence: but on the other hand, they propound <hi>David</hi> for an Example of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and give him the Character of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>the fartheſt off from all manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 285.</note> then whom, there never was a greater Inſtance of Self-defence. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I took it ſomewhat unkindly, to have theſe Homilies alledged againſt me, when I was doing the very work of them. When
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66311:50"/>
I was alienating Men's Minds from the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt whom theſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies are particularly levell'd, and of whom they give us this Caution. <q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all good Subjects, knowing theſe the ſpecial Inſtruments and Miniſters of the Devil,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 310.</note> to the ſtirring up of <hi>all</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, avoid and flee them, and the peſtilent Suggeſtions of ſuch forreign Uſurpers, and their Adherents.</q>
When I was endeavouring to render Men averſe from worſhipping <hi>the Babylonical Beaſt of Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 316.</note> who had then <hi>lately procured the breach of the publick Peace in</hi> England <hi>(with the long and bleſſed Continuance whereof,</hi> ſays the Homily, <hi>he is ſore grieved) by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of his diſguiſed Chaplains, whiſpering in the Ears of certain Northern Borderers</hi>; upon occaſion of whoſe Rebellion theſe Homilies were written, wherein they are deſcribed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 302.</note> as <hi>ready to kill all that ſhall or dare ſpeak againſt their falſe Superſtition and wicked Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, 2. If theſe Homilies muſt be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt me, for maintaining that a lawful Defence may be made againſt ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Oppreſſion, why are they not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe urged againſt Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> himſelf, who wrote them? For in the Defence of his Apology, he has theſe words. <q>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66311:51"/>

They ſeek not to kill, but to ſave their own Lives, as they have openly proteſted by publick writing unto the World. As for us we are Strangers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Caſe; they themſelves are beſt acquainted with the Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Country; and therefore are beſt able to yield account of the Grounds and Reaſons of their Doings.</q>
Now here is a Biſhop of a different mind from our Author, for he would have conſulted a common Lawyer about a Caſe of Conſcience, and clearly thought <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall Divinity</hi> to be much better in this Caſe than <hi>Pulpit-Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why are not theſe Homilies urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bp <hi>Bilſon?</hi> who in his Book of the true difference betwixt Chriſtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Unchriſtian Rebellion, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue between <hi>Theophilus</hi> a Chriſtian and <hi>Philander</hi> a Jeſuite, (ſo that a Jeſuite in that Age was not thought worthy to be accounted a Chriſtian) has ſeveral large
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66311:51"/>
Diſcourſes, which do not at all accord with the Paſſive Doctrine; tho my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerers</hi> have uſed great force and violence towards him, to get him on their ſide. The Author of <hi>Jovian</hi> particularly, p. 229 has ſtrangely wreſted him: for what the Biſhop, Phyſician-like, preſcribes to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who had the Laws mortally againſt them, <hi>Deliverance if you would have, obtain it by Prayer, and expect it in Peace, thoſe be weapons for Chriſtians</hi>; that Author applies in his old way to thoſe, who (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God) have the Laws on their ſide, and Deliverance by them already. And ſo in the next paſſage, the Biſhop ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Caſe, ſays, <hi>The Subject has no refuge againſt his Soveraign,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap. 14.</hi> And of this Intent ſhould ſuch a Nation be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded, then their King might ſpoile them of their Goods, which before was lawful for no man to do.</note> 
                  <hi>but only to God, by Prayer and Patience:</hi> But this is not the Caſe of Men who are under the Protection of the Laws, which were made on purpoſe to be a Defence and Refuge againſt all lawleſs Oppreſſion whatſoever; or elſe, as Chancellour <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſcue</hi> ſays, the People would be cruely cheated.</p>
               <p>Afterwards that Author skips over a large Defence of the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, and of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine (concerning which I may ſay to him in the Biſhop's words, <hi>And this I ween you will hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute

               <p>Laſtly; Why do they not urge theſe Homilies againſt all the Compilers of them, and the whole Clergy of <hi>England?</hi> who in ſeveral Convocations in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Reign, not only maintained in words the Juſtice of the <hi>French, Scotch,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Defences which the Proteſtants of thoſe Countries made for the ſafeguard of their Lives, Liberties and Religion, but laid down their Purſes to help them; and charged themſelves deeply with Taxes, in conſideration of the Queen's great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Expences in aſſiſting them: As you may ſee in the Preambles of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies Subſidy-Acts in that Reign.</p>
               <p>5 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 24. Amongſt other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, for which they give their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy of ſix ſhillings in the pound, they have theſe words: <q>And finally, ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ineſtimable Charges ſuſtained by

your Highneſs, aſwell of late days in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi> to Unity and Concord, as alſo in procuring, as much as in your Highneſs lieth, by all kind of godly and prudent means, the abating of all Hoſtility and Perſecution within the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> practiſed and uſed againſt the Profeſſors of God's holy Goſpel and true Religion.</q>
The firſt thing in this Paſſage is the Queen's Aſſiſtance of the Scotiſh Nobility in their Reformation, in which the Queen of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> reſiſted them to her power, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>French</hi> Forces into <hi>Scotland</hi>: which is ſet down at large in our Chronicles.<note place="margin">Stow. p. <hi>640.</hi>

                  <q>The Princely and upright Preſervation of the Liberty of the next Realm and Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi> from imminent Captivity and Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>
The other thing is the godly and prudent means, for abating Hoſtility and Perſecution within the Realm of <hi>France.</hi> Now Hiſtory will inform us,<note place="margin">Stow. p. <hi>650.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>thoſe</hi> were the Forces, ſent under <hi>Dudley</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to <hi>Newhaven,</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,</hi> who were then in Arms. We have ſome modern illuminated Divines who would not ſtick to call this the abetting of a Rebellion; but the whole Biſhops
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66311:53"/>
and Clergy, and amongſt them the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers of the Homilies, call it the uſe of Godly and Prudent Means to abate Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility and Perſecution, practiſed againſt the Profeſſors of God's holy Goſpel and true Religion: for ſo that Charitable Clergy could find in their hearts to call a parcel of <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> who never had a Biſhop amongſt them, whom ſome in this degenerate Age would ſooner unchurch and deſtroy, than aid or aſſiſt.</p>
               <p>Again; <q>The Clergy grant another Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy, 35 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 12. in conſideration of her Majeſty's Charges, in the provident and needful Prevention of ſuch intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Attempts as tended to the extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſincere Profeſſion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, both here and elſewhere.</q>
The Temporalties Subſidy-Act at the ſame time will explain this to us, in theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for their Tax: <q>Beſides the great and perpetual Honour which it hath pleaſed God to give your Majeſty abroad,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:66311:54"/>And to the ſame purpoſe again the Temporalty, 39. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 27. <q>This Land is become ſince your Majeſties happy Days, both a Port and Haven of Refuge for diſtreſſed States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and a Rock and Bulwark of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt the Tyrannies and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Attempts of mighty and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Potentates.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Neither are the Clergy in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy-Act, 43 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 17. at all behind them, either with their Money, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments. <q>For who hath, or ſhould have a livelier Senſe, or better Remembrance of your Majeſties Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Courage and Conſtancy, in advancing and protecting the free Profeſſion of the Goſpel, within and without your Majeſties Dominions, than your Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy?</q>
               </p>
               <p>From hence I argue, That if the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Proteſtants were Rebels, in defending themſelves againſt illegal and deſtructive Violence, then the Biſhops and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> quite through Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, by their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, involved themſelves in the ſame Guilt. For it had been utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and an horrid Sin, to aſſiſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the Violation of their Duty and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66311:54"/>
Allegiance, and to turn, at leaſt, a whole Years Revenue of all the ſpiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions in <hi>England,</hi> into Swords, to be employed in reſiſting the Ordinance of God. Thoſe Men muſt needs have a great mind to partake of that Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherewith St. <hi>Paul</hi> threatens this Sin, who were willing to purchaſe it at ſo dear a rate.</p>
               <p>By which it appears, that this modiſh Paſſive Doctrine of ſubmitting for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake to illegal Violence, and all ſorts of lawleſs Oppreſſion, is all Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Innovation; and a thing wholly unknown to the Compilers of the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; who dream'd as little of it, as they did of the late unnatural deſtructive War, which it produc'd. And hereby likewiſe the Reader will be enabled to judg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and my Adverſaries, who is truer to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> They or I, and who are really guilty of Apoſtacy from it; they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Primitive Senſe of the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, or they that follow the upſtart and new-fangled Opinions of a few miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and deſigning Innovators.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt thing to be anſwered, are the Religious Pretences which are fetch'd from Scripture, for the ſupport of this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66311:55"/>
Paſſive Doctrine. Before I come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the particular Texts which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has alledged, I ſhall ſay ſomewhat in general concerning the great Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of intereſſing Scripture in this Controverſy, for this reaſon: becauſe <hi>Chriſt meddles not with the Secular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this World,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the Scripture it ſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.22. and our Author in his Preface allows that Inference: Or, as <hi>Luther</hi> expreſſes it;<note place="margin">The true dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. <hi>517, 518.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe, <hi>The Goſpel doth not bar nor aboliſh any Politick Laws</hi>; which Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he always held, and Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> did believe that it could not be refuted; the Truth whereof I ſhall prove both by direct Argument, and by parallel Inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture does not meddle with the Secular Government of this World, ſo as to alter it: for to alter Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is to overthrow the juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts and Agreements which have been made amongſt Men; to which they have mutually bound themſelves by Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Oaths and Oaths of Allegiance; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the duties of Governours and Subjects are become the moral Duties of Honeſty, Juſtice, and righteous dealing; which no Man will ſay, it is the work of the Goſpel to deſtroy or aboliſh.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:66311:55"/>2. If Scripture has made any alteration in the Secular Government of the World, then that alteration is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and all Governments which are not reformed according to it, are unlawful; which if it be ſaid concerning our own Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is Treaſon; and if it be ſaid of all other Governments in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> is very ill manners; for none of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, much leſs can be proved, to agree exactly with any ſuch Pattern given in the Mount.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place therefore, Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity has given no new meaſures of Rule and Government, nor of Obedience and Subjection; but on the other hand, has forbidden Men to remove the old Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, by confirming and re-inforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the known Duties of Morality in this Caſe, as it has done in like Caſes. It has charged Maſters to be juſt to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Servants to be obedient to their Maſters, whereby it has created no new Right on either ſide: For Maſters were always bound to allow their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that which is juſt and equal, and Servants to yield Obedience; but in what meaſures or proportions we muſt not expect to find in Scripture, for that is left to be determined by former parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66311:56"/>
Contracts, or by the Laws and Cuſtoms of every Country. For even thoſe Precepts of abſolute Obedience,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.9.</note> for <hi>Servants to obey their Maſters in all things, and to pleaſe them well in all things,</hi> do not alter any of thoſe meaſures of Obedience, which the Parties themſelves ſhall agree upon, or the uſage of every Country does preſcribe. For an Engliſh Servant is not bound to obey his Maſter in all lawful things, if they be inconvenient, and no part of his Bargain. It is lawful for a Servant to obey his covetous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and to pleaſe him well, in taking but one half of his Wages in full of all; but I preſume he may do better to diſobey, and diſpleaſe him too in that matter, and to inſiſt upon having his whole Due. It is certainly lawful, according to Mr. <hi>Long,</hi> for an Engliſh Servant to obey paſſively, <hi>nay ſuffering, tho wrongfully, is his calling</hi>; and yet if he refuſe to ſerve in Chains, and to be uſed like a Gally-Slave, and ſo diſobey and diſpleaſe in that matter, it is no breach of his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: for St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf could not abide to be ſmitten <hi>contrary to Law,</hi> tho it were at the command of the High-Prieſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.3. He preſently indeed recalled his reviling Language, but he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66311:56"/>
did not correct his ſharp Reſentment of that Injury.</p>
               <p>If ſome Men could find ſuch Texts as theſe for Subjects, what Iron Yokes, and what heavy Burdens would they not preſently lay upon them? and yet they would no more bind Engliſh Subjects, than theſe Texts which were directed to Roman Slaves, are the duty of Engliſh Servants. I might inſtance in ſeveral other Relative Duties in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if it were needful. Accordingly ſuch Precepts as this, <hi>Render unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things which are</hi> Caeſars, do not alter or deſtroy the Laws of our Country, but plainly refer us to them; for we know not who is <hi>Caeſar,</hi> nor who <hi>Caeſar</hi> is, but by the Law of the Land. And the things of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or what belongs to him, are not whatſoever he may demand; for then when we are bid to <hi>render all Men their Dues,</hi> we are as much bound to ſatisfy their Demands, let them be what they will, and never ſo unjuſt and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And as for that new Device in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian,</hi> of learning our Allegiance, or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Duty from the Notion of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, it is a ſort of conjuring; for I may as well know the juſt Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which one Man owes to another,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66311:57"/>
meerly from the Notion of a Creditor.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid this in general, I ſhall now particularly examine thoſe Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which this Author alledges; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of God: The Powers that be, are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God: and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation. From which Text</hi> Epiphanius <hi>proves, that the many Magiſtates under one King, are ordained of God</hi>; and thence our Author infers, <hi>That the Power of under-Officers, ſince it is the Ordinance of God, ought no more to be reſiſted than the King's.</hi> Adding this further, <hi>Though this may ſeem harſh in an Engliſh-man's Ears, who will acknowledg perhaps that the King can do no Injury, and is above the Cenſure of the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>yet he knows his Officers are accountable for any illegal Act; and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Command of the Prince cannot ſecure them from being impeach'd by the People: granting this to be very true; yet I ſhall ſtill aſſert that the Inferiour Magiſtrate, though in the Execution of an illegal Act, is not to be repelled by Force.</hi> To this I anſwer, I grant that Inferiour Magiſtrates, rightly conſtituted, and duly executing their
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66311:57"/>
Office, are the Ordinance of God (for Government would be an impracticable thing without them); but as you ſhall ſee anon, the Text it ſelf carries this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation in the Bowels of it; for it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes both the Uſurpation of an Office, and the illegal and malicious Exerciſe of it. If our Tranſlators in this place had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, Authority, that is, a juſt and <hi>lawful Power,</hi> as they have rendred it in other places, and as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſignifies, they had effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the falſe Application of this Text. But now it is eaſy to ſhelter illegal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, unauthoritative Acts, and all manner of unlawful and outragious Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence under the word <hi>Power</hi>; for theſe are Might, tho they be not Right. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall make ſhort work with this Impoſture; for if theſe things before-named, be really contained in this Text, under the word <hi>Power,</hi> and by virtue of this Text are forbidden to be reſiſted, why then let us put them into the Text (which is the ſureſt way of trying the Sence of any Scripture) and let us ſee how they will become the place. And then it runs thus, There is no illegal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66311:58"/>
Commiſſion, nor outragious Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of Inferiour Officers, <hi>but of God.</hi> The Rapines, Burglaries, Aſſaſſinations, Maſſacres, which are commited by Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Officers, <hi>are ordained of God:</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore withſtands theſe, <hi>reſiſts the Ordinance of God.</hi> What blaſphemous ſtuff is this which Men dare to affix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Text of Scripture, which is no other than the Voice of God approving all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Government, and confirming from Heaven thoſe moral Duties of Subjection, Obedience, and Non-reſiſtance, which were always due to lawful Authority; but you plainly ſee are not due to illegal Violence, for that is clearly ſhut out of the Text, the Text it ſelf will by no means admit it, but ſpues it out. In the ſame manner you may likewiſe try, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſurped Power, or thoſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude into the Government, and get into Office by wicked and undue means, <hi>be the Ordinance of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, our Author quotes St. <hi>Peter</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Let's hear St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<hi>'s Opinion in the Caſe,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13, 14, 15.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 53.</note> 
                  <hi>Submit your ſelves unto every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Man for the Lord's ſake, whether to the King as Supream, or unto Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as unto them that are ſent by him—
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66311:58"/>
for this is the Will of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>From this 'tis plain that we ought to ſubmit to Inferiour Officers for the Lord's ſake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream; this ſubordinate Power being from God, tho not immediately.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall hot trouble my ſelf, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor does, about the Queſtion, whether the true rendring of this place be, <hi>ſubmit to every humane Creature,</hi> meaning Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Creature; or, <hi>ſubmit to every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Man,</hi> as our Tranſlation has it; which, he ſays, is an improper Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and has given occaſion to a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Error: for let the lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be of what Extraction it will, every Subject muſt ſubmit to it <hi>for the Lord's ſake.</hi> The preſent Queſtion, which wants St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Reſolution, is, Whether we are bound to ſubmit to the illegal Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of under-Officers? which I ſuppoſe will prove to be in the Negative: For St. <hi>Peter</hi> plainly limits our Submiſſion to ſuch Governours, as are in Subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the King, and are ſent by him, and come on this Errand (which it was not over honeſt in our Author to conceal) <hi>for the Puniſhment of Evil-doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do well.</hi> Whereas it is evident, that the illegal Violence of Inferiour Governours, croſſes the very
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66311:59"/>
end of their Inſtitution: beſides, they are not in any ſuch Act <hi>ſent by the King,</hi> but come of their own Head; and which is more, they do this in Contradiction to the King's declared Will and Pleaſure, which is his Law, and <hi>againſt his Crown and Dignity,</hi> as an Indictment does fully ſet forth ſuch Offences. For I muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our Author of his Acknowledgment a little before, <hi>that the King's Officers an accountable for any illegal Act, and the very Command of the Prince cannot ſecure them from being impeach'd by the People.</hi> Now if they may be proſecuted and hang'd by the People, as any other private Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor (but by the way, is that ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them for the Lord's ſake?) why may not a juſt and neceſſary Defence be made againſt them, as againſt any other <hi>Evil-doers?</hi> For that very reaſon, ſays our Author in his Preface, becauſe it is a Sin to reſiſt any Evil-doer, for <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has commanded us not to reſiſt Evil, (Evil not ſignifying a thing, but a Perſon</hi>) Mat. 5.39. and thence he infers that <hi>we ought not to damn our ſelves, to prevent the Violence of a Murderer, though offered to our ſelves.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I am much confirmed in the truth which I maintain, when I ſee that no Man
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66311:59"/>
can fairly oppoſe it, without falling into the very dregs of Quakeriſm, and into thoſe pernicious Principles, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render the quiet and peaceable part of Mankind to the Diſcretion of a few miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and blood-thirſty Men, and in effect put a Sword into their Hands to ſlay us. If this be Goſpel, <hi>gaudeant Latrones,</hi> 'tis good Tydings not to the true Man, but to the Thief, to the Cyclops, to the Canibal, to the hungry <hi>Iriſh</hi> Woolf, and to the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to all others it is a very hard Saying. But to ſhew that this Argument may be otherwiſe anſwered, than with a ſhrug, it is plain, 1. That this Precept of our Saviour requires great Limitation; for elſe, among other things, a Chriſtian Magiſtrate himſelf might not reſiſt an Evil-doer. 2. That it carries a Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficient for my preſent purpoſe along with it. For all the Inſtances in which our Saviour forbids Reſiſtance, are <hi>matters of a light nature,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> expreſſes it. And the bearing of ſuch tolerable Evils and Inconveniencies is no <hi>peculiar</hi> Duty of Chriſtianity, for any wiſe moral Man would rather take a flap on the Face patiently, than turn ſuch a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Battery into a Fray and <hi>Bloodſhed</hi>;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66311:60"/>
and rather receive two ſlight Injuries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one after another, then revenge the firſt. For I ſhall here take occaſion to inform our Author, that Revenge never was a natural Right, as he affirms, <hi>p.</hi> 57. but a Sin againſt the Light of Nature; and that the neceſſary Preſervation of a Man's Life or Livelihood, or the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a juſt and unblameable Defence, do mightily differ from Revenge.</p>
               <p>And as our Author wholly wreſts our Saviour's Doctrine; ſo, in the next place, he wilfully miſ-repreſents his Caſe, as every Man knows who has read the four Goſpels.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 55.</note> For he was not <hi>ſet upon</hi> in an <hi>illegal</hi> manner, but apprehended by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Officers, who had a Warrant from the Sanhedrin, the ſupream Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, the Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral amongſt the Jews, and were aided by the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards for fear of a Reſcue; or, as the Chief Prieſts and Elders expreſt it, leſt there ſhould <hi>be an uproar among the People:</hi> and in oppoſition to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority St. <hi>Peter</hi> drew his Sword, and wounded <hi>Malchus,</hi> a Servant or Officer of the High-Prieſt's, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.51. Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> there ſays, <hi>He was the chief Officer, or Foreman of them that had the Warrant to apprehend our Saviour.</hi> So that if ever
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66311:60"/>
Sword was <hi>wrongfully</hi> drawn, and in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to lawful Authority, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s was; and therefore was deſervedly charm'd into the Sheath again. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, we cannot admit one Syllable of our Author's Inferences.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now confute his Anſwers to my five Propoſitions, but every ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reader will be able, from what I have already ſaid, to do it himſelf.</p>
               <p>I quoted <hi>Bracton</hi> to prove that the Prerogative is bounded by Law, and made no further uſe of his words; but I ſhould have been aſhamed of ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as our Author makes, when from theſe words of his own citing, <hi>Rex habet Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorem Deum, item Legem, per quam factus eſt Rex, item Curiam ſuam,</hi> viz. <hi>Comites &amp; Barones.</hi> He infers, that <hi>there is no more Power allowed to the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 61.</note> 
                  <hi>then there is to the Earls and Barons; who can only morally oblige the King's Conſcience, when he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded their Counſels are juſt.</hi> What their Power is in <hi>Bracton</hi> I need not ſay, for <hi>Bracton</hi> is an Author ſufficiently known, and what it is in the Mirror, that very ancient Law-book, need not be told the World; but any Man may as well infer from this Paſſage, that there is no more Power allowed to God than to the Earls
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66311:61"/>
and Barons; which abſurd Inference is enough to ſhew the Weakneſs and Folly of his.</p>
               <p>In the next place he tells me, that I have <hi>forgot the Service of the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 62.</note> 
                  <hi>if I do not conſtantly thank God for the Example of the Thebaean Legion.</hi> I do thank God for this, that the Service of our Church is purged from ſuch Fopperies, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendary Stories; or elſe I would never have declared my Aſſent and Conſent to it: But when I thank God for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Confirmation, which the ſeven Sleepers have given us of the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; I ſhall then remember to do as much for the Example of the <hi>Thebaean</hi> Legion. For tho I admitted it as a Caſe to be argued upon, as I would any feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Caſe of <hi>John-a-Nokes</hi> and <hi>John-a-Stiles,</hi> and ſhewed that it was not our Caſe; yet when it is obtruded as matter of Religion and Devotion, I muſt take the boldneſs to call it a Fable. And I have very good reaſon to believe it to be ſo, when <hi>Euſebius,</hi> the very Father <hi>Fox</hi> of the Primitive Church, who lived in <hi>Maximian</hi>'s Perſecution, and wrote ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years after, has not one word of it, nor any of the voluminous Fathers of the fourth Century; but <hi>Eucherius,</hi> who lived
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66311:61"/>
about a hundred and fourty Years after the thing is ſaid to be done, is the firſt Author who is quoted for it. So that <hi>Maximian</hi> not only cut off this feigned Army of Martyrs, but buried them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground for 140 Years, and then they roſe up again, as the Pied Pipers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren did in a far Country. And our Author eaſily confirms me in the belief that it is a Romance, when he here tells us, that <hi>Eucherius</hi> made that brave reſolute Speech to the Emperour; for many a true word is ſaid by miſtake.</p>
               <p>As for our Author's Performance, I leave that to the Judgment of the World; and ſo he might have done my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Popery and Paganiſm, without endeavouring to ſlur what he cannot anſwer. But tho I have forgiven him all his Abuſes of me, yet I cannot his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling the Homilies, when he calls what they ſay againſt Popery,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 65.</note> 
                  <hi>the old Elizabeth-way of railing.</hi> And I hope all they that have ſubſcribed the Homilies, <hi>as godly and wholſom Doctrine, and fit for theſe times,</hi> will never endure them to be run down by pretended Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men, and Vipers in her Boſom, both as unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ungodly; as what is now out of faſhion, and as what, according to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66311:62"/>
them, ought never to have been in.</p>
               <p>And thus I have anſwered what I thought material in this Author, and have conſulted the Reader's Eaſe as well as my own, in paſſing over the reſt of his Book; of which I muſt needs ſay, that I never ſaw ſo great a number of Falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſo ſmall a Volume in my whole Life: whereby I perceive that the deſign of theſe Men is not in the leaſt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Truth; but their buſineſs is to impoſe upon the World, to blind and inſlave Men at once; juſt as the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> did by <hi>Sampſon,</hi> they put out his Eyes, and then made him grind in a Mill. And therefore the juſt Suſpicions which I otherways have, that this Author is a known Papiſt, are not at all removed by his pretending to be of our Church; for he that will write an hundred Untruths, will certainly write one more.</p>

Figure in the Times of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Julian.</hi> I thought very innocently, a Man might be allowed to ſay, That the Line Male of the Houſe of <hi>York</hi> ended in <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the Third, without telling the World a long impertinent Story of <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> and <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi>; but now I ſee, that upon ſuch an occaſion, unleſs a Man writes the Memoirs of ſuch Impoſtors, and Vagabond Landlopers, he ſhall be repreſented by our Author as an Impoſtor himſelf. However, I regard it the leſs, becauſe I had not more diverſion in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heretofore the Tragi-Comedy of this Impoſtor, than I have now in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's management of him: To ſee <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s Couſin <hi>Procopius,</hi> ſtanding by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the bottom of a Genealogy,<note place="margin">See the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy in <hi>Jovian,</hi> p. <hi>41.</hi>
                  </note> juſt like a Cipher, without Father, without Mother, and without Deſcent; where the Noble <hi>Algernon</hi>'s Couſin might as well have ſtood, if the Herald had ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But after all, if this famous <hi>Procopius</hi> muſt needs be brought into Play, he is clearly on my ſide: For his ſetting up for Emperor, under pretence of being of the <hi>Conſtantine</hi> Family, is a ſtrong Proof, that the Empire was look'd upon as Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; as <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi>'s Impoſture did ſuppoſe the Kingdom to be ſo here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:66311:64"/>Neither, laſtly, does the paſſing by of <hi>Varronianus,</hi> the Infant-Son of <hi>Jovian,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify any thing; when <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> was ſet aſide thrice, and ſeveral other <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes were put by for their Minority. Whereas on the other hand, <hi>Valentinian</hi> being made Emperor at four Years old, is a greater Argument that the Empire was Hereditary, than the ſetting aſide Ten at that Age, is to prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>Secondly; <hi>Jovian</hi>'s <hi>quiet Behaviour</hi> is no proof that <hi>Valentinian,</hi> as much a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor as he, behaved himſelf quietly, when he ſtruck the Prieſt; nor that all the other Chriſtians behaved themſelves qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly under <hi>Julian,</hi> when they did not; particularly the generous and zealous <hi>Caeſareans,</hi>

Now on the other hand, how if <hi>Jovian</hi> himſelf was as generous, and as zealous a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, as any of them? For tho he had
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66311:64"/>
laid down his Commiſſion, and was caſhiered for not ſacrificing, and obeying the Commandment of the wicked King; yet <hi>Julian,</hi> in his Expedition for <hi>Perſia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Socrat. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>by Neceſſity of the approaching War, had him amongſt his Commanders,</hi> as <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Words are. I have been often puzled, to imagine what that <hi>Neceſſity</hi> ſhould be, and have ſometimes been inclined to think that <hi>Julian</hi> ſtood in need of him for his Conduct, to command ſome part of his Army, who indeed, for his Abilities, was fitteſt to have commanded in chief. But that cannot be, for the great <hi>Jovian</hi> was but a <hi>Pike-man</hi> in that Expedition,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> and was not entruſted with any Command, ſo much as that of a Sergeant, and was no more than a common Foot-Souldier, when he was choſen Emperor. And therefore <hi>Julian</hi> could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, nor leave him behind him, upon ſome other account; and whether that were, leſt in his abſence he ſhould go and live at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> which was cloſe by <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzum,</hi> where old <hi>Gregory</hi> dwelt, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what other account, I deſire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by our Author.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; <hi>Jovian</hi>'s being libelled and abuſed by none but the Heathens of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> for making a diſhonourable Peace
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66311:65"/>
with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> which Reproach the Chriſtians always wiped off from him, and juſtly laid it upon <hi>Julian</hi>'s Raſhneſs, or for his being a Chriſtian, (which is undeniably true, as <hi>Baronius</hi> has already proved it in <hi>Jovian</hi>'s Life, and as I could further prove, if it were worth the while) does by no means prove, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of <hi>Antioch</hi> abuſed <hi>him</hi> as well as <hi>Julian,</hi> and conſequently would have abuſed any Body. Whereas it is evident, both from the <hi>Miſopogon</hi> it ſelf, and from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Teſtimony of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Chriſtians Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to <hi>Julian,</hi> did proceed purely from the height of their Chriſtianity, and their fervent Love to Chriſt. It is too much in reaſon to tell Men a Story, and to find them Ears too; but I will do it for once, as to this Story of <hi>Theodoret.</hi> The Words were theſe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note>
                  <q>That the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> who had received their Chriſtianity from the greateſt Pair of Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and had a warm Affection for the Lord and Saviour of all, did always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominate <hi>Julian,</hi> who ought never to be remembred; you have his own Word for it: For, for this reaſon he wrote a Book againſt them, and called them the <hi>Beard-haters.</hi>
                  </q>
Now the ſame Men, that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66311:65"/>
derived their Chriſtianity from the chiefeſt Apoſtles, and had a great Love for our Saviour, were the Men that could not endure <hi>Julian,</hi> and againſt whom, for that reaſon, he writ his <hi>Miſopogon.</hi> So that, according to <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that Book was cauſed by their Hatred to <hi>Julian,</hi> and their Hatred to <hi>Julian</hi> was cauſed by their Love to Chriſt, and their Love to Chriſt proceeded from their pure and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtianity. And let our Author find any new ways of ſhuffling, to call this Zeal Scurrility, if he can.</p>
               <p>And, fourthly, <hi>Jovian</hi> is ſo far from proving <hi>Julian</hi>'s Army in <hi>Perſia</hi> to be <hi>all Christians,</hi> or <hi>almoſt all Chriſtians,</hi> (as my divided Anſwerers ſay) or Chriſtians at all, that it is demonſtrable from his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they were Heathens; for he therefore refuſed the Empire, becauſe they were Heathens. He refuſed it at firſt,<note place="margin">Socrat. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.</note> when he was choſen by the Army, in the abſence of the Commanders; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the Commanders had agreed to the Army's Choice, and had ſet him upon a high Stage, and given him all the Titles of Majeſty, calling him <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi>; ſtill he refuſed it, not fearing the Princes nor Souldiers altering their Minds for the worſe, but told them plainly,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66311:66"/>
                  <q>I cannot,<note place="margin">Theod. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> being a Chriſtian as I am, take the Government of ſuch Men, nor be the Emperor over <hi>Julian</hi>'s Army, which is principled in a wicked Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for ſuch Men, being left deſtitute of God's Providence, will become an eaſy Prey and Sport to our Enemies. The Souldiers having heard theſe Words, cried out with one Voice: O King, let not that Doubt trouble you, neither do you decline the Government of us, as a wicked Government; for you ſhall reign over Chriſtians, and Men bred up in the true Religion: For the elder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us were bred under <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the reſt under <hi>Conſtantius</hi>; and the Reign of this Man, who is now dead, has been ſhort, and not ſufficient to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Heatheniſm in the Minds of thoſe that have been ſeduced.</q>
Now this is a Demonſtration, that <hi>Julian</hi>'s Army were profeſt Heathens: for it is Nonſence to ſay, that <hi>Jovian,</hi> who was ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Army, and was all along with it in that Expedition, did not know what Religion the Army profeſt. Or I would fain know what Danger he was in, for declaring againſt Heatheniſm in a Chriſtian Army; that <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſhould ſay, <q>This brave Man, uſing his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66311:66"/>
accuſtomed Boldneſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (that is, ſays our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 105. confeſſing Chriſt boldly in the midſt of his Enemies, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Danger of Torture or Death) not fearing the Princes or Armies Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the worſe, ſaid, I cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chriſtian, take upon me the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſuch Men.</q>
It may indeed be demanded, why the Army, knowing his Religion as well as he knew theirs, ſhould nevertheleſs chuſe him for their Emperor? But all the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians furniſh us with this ready Anſwer, That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was in miſerable Straits and Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and had been all loſt, without a Man of his matchleſs Courage and Conduct to head them: And then their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration ſhews, that they were Heathens only upon liking, and had not been long enough to contract an Averſion to that Religion, in which they were bred.</p>
               <p>For my part, I never read of any other profeſt Chriſtians in <hi>Julian</hi>'s Army in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> beſides <hi>Jovian</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> (for I can aſſure our Author, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> was not there, unleſs he march'd like an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, with his Caſtle on his Back, for he was then in Priſon for ſtriking the Prieſt) except we ſhould likewiſe add him, whom <hi>Libanius</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> talk of.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66311:67"/>
But when <hi>Jovian</hi> had thus reſolutely declared himſelf, the Army like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe declared themſelves Chriſtians, and gave him a very good Reaſon, why he ſhould not diſtruſt their ſudden Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They were ſuch Chriſtians, as we have in great plenty at the end of every one of the Primitive Perſecutions, who turn'd Heathens to ſave themſelves, and when the Danger was over, immediatly return'd to the Church again. Which was the worſe in theſe Chriſtians, I mean <hi>Jovian</hi>'s Chriſtians, and <hi>Julian</hi>'s Heathens, becauſe,<note place="margin">Chronic. An. <hi>365.</hi> Blanda Perſecutio il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciens magis quàm impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens ad ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificandum.</note> as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> obſerves, <q>
                     <hi>Julian</hi>'s Perſecution was a winning Perſecution, rather leading, than driving Men to Heatheniſm.</q>
However, this is leſs to be wondred at in an Army, when we have ſeen the ſame Unſteadineſs and Volubility in Univerſities, Clergy, and Convocations, who, to the reproach of this Nation, without ſo much as <hi>Julian</hi>'s Perſecution, or <hi>Jovian</hi>'s Declaration, have been Papiſts or Proteſtants, as their Princes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined; and have made more haſte to turn to and fro, than theſe Souldiers did.</p>
               <p>This plain Matter of Fact, which I have therefore ſet down the more at large, does evidently ſhew the Falſhood of that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66311:67"/>
Aſſertion, <hi>That</hi> Julian's <hi>Army in</hi> Perſia <hi>was for the moſt part Chriſtian.</hi> It may be my Anſwerers fell into this Miſtake, if it be not wilful, by jumbling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Beginning and latter End of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s Reign. For our Author might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee, that <hi>Gregory</hi> mentions the <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of more than Seven Thouſand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Invect.</hi> 1. p. 75.</note> 
                  <hi>which had not bowed the Knee to</hi> Baal, before <hi>Julian</hi> had made any Edict againſt the Chriſtians in any kind, ſo much as to call them <hi>Galileans</hi>; before he had enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them with his Donative, and uſed many other Arts of corrupting them, or made his Edict of caſhiering the Chriſtians. And it is intolerable falſe Reaſoning, to conclude, that the State of Affairs in the end of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Reign, was the ſame that it was in the beginning: For, as <hi>Gregory</hi> obſerves, in the beginning of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Reign, Chriſtianity was the eſtabliſh'd and prevailing Religion; and therefore for <hi>Julian</hi> to attempt to alter and diſturb it, was no other thing than to ſhake the Roman Empire,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>80.</hi>
                  </note> and to hazard the whole Commonwealth; and that afterwards the Empire was actually filled with Sedition, Confuſion, and Fighting, on that account.</p>
               <p>But now let us take a view of the Face of Things in the latter end of his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66311:68"/>
Reign, at which time he had ſet the Jews on work to repair their Temple at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>; but Fire came out from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, in ſuch a wonderful violent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as killed many of them, and forced them all to deſiſt. <q>Theſe Things did not happen,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeos.</hi> Orat. 3.</note> ſays St. <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> in the Reign of godly Emperors, but at a time when we were in a miſerable low Condition; when we all went in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of our Lives, when the common Freedom of Mankind was taken from us, when Paganiſm flouriſh'd; when the Chriſtians either hid themſelves in their Houſes, or were fled into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and were not to be ſeen in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, then theſe Things happened, that no manner of impudent Pretence might be left the Jews, and that they might not be able to ſay, that the Chriſtians came upon them, and put a ſtop to the Work.</q>
No, alas! they were not in a condition to diſturb any Body, if they had had never ſo much mind to it. Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it ſelf cannot ſay, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were able to hinder the Jews in this Work. That is the Father's reaſoning in this place.</p>
               <p>You have ſeen already, what Strength of Numbers the Chriſtians had, in <hi>Julian</hi>'s
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66311:68"/>
Army: And as for what Force of Arms and Ammunition they had out of the Army, appears fully by <hi>Julian</hi>'s Edict, a conſiderable time before,<note place="margin">Julian Ep. ad Boſtrenſ.</note> wherein he charges all the Chriſtian Laity in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>not to be perſuaded by their Biſhops to take up Stones, and diſobey the Magistrate.</hi> Truly, a very dangerous Magazine! Can any thing be more plainly ſaid, to ſhew that the Chriſtians were diſarmed, and naked, and defenceleſs, even to contempt? And that they might well complain, with <hi>Gregory,</hi> that they had neither Arms nor Ammunition, <hi>nor Wall, nor Weapon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 123.</note> 
                  <hi>nor any Defence left them, but their Hope in God, as being deprived and retrench'd of all humane Aid:</hi> That is, as our <hi>Author</hi> explains this Paſſage, <hi>p.</hi> 178. They had Walls, and Weapons, and humane <hi>Aid</hi>; and they had them not: <hi>Not that they wanted Strength and Numbers, but by the Principles of their ſuffering Religion they could not uſe them.</hi> Now they never had them to uſe, contrary to the Principles of their Religion; why then does <hi>Gregory</hi> ſay, they had them not <hi>left?</hi> It ſeems they once had them, in the ſame Sence in which they now wanted them. Did ever any Man complain that he wanted Bread, meaning, that he had a Peck-Loaf
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66311:69"/>
ſtanding by him, but wanted a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, or inward Principle of eating? If a thouſand Tranſcribers interpret Authors at this rate, I ſhall beg all their Pardons. As for that indefinite Speech of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> Pſal. 124.</note> that <hi>Christian Souldiers ſerved under</hi> Julian, it is very true, if they did ſo in any part of his Reign, or if to the number of two ſerved under him; and therefore proves nothing in this matter: For <hi>Christiani Milites</hi> is either Units, or Tens, or Tens of Millions. And when our Author tells me how many they were, and when they ſerved under him, I will give him a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The next Thing he touches upon in his Preface, is, That the Roman Empire was not entailed, (he ſhould have ſaid, unleſs it were entailed by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or elſe he uſes <hi>Euſebius</hi> very unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy) from whence he concludes, <hi>That it was either great Ignorance, or great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs in me, to aſſert it to be Hereditary.</hi> I deſire to know which of the two it was in Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> who aſſerted it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an hundred Years before I did, in theſe Words: <q>The Roman Empire it ſelf,<note place="margin">

that is, ſeven hundred Years, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, went by Succeſſion, ſave where the Right-Lines failed, or Sedition diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Heir.</q>
Where he likewiſe matches it with the Hereditary Kingdoms of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France, Spain, Scotland,</hi> and others. And further, I deſire to know, at what time afterwards the Empire began to be Hereditary, if it were not ſo in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s Family, where there was an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Succeſſion of Five from <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culeus Maximianus</hi> to <hi>Julian?</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſuch an Inſtance of uninterrupted Succeſſion, which is a great Rarity in Kingdoms that are undoubtedly Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which, tho it be matter of Fact, is no Proof of Right, the expreſs Teſtimony of <hi>Euſebius</hi> is ſo full and convincing, <hi>that it deſcended from Father to Son, like any other Patrimony,</hi> that I needed not to have added other Proofs, for I ſee that alone cannot be anſwered. I was not in the leaſt concern'd to prove, that the Empire deſcended in a right Line, from the twelve <hi>Caeſars</hi> down to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and therefore our Author needed not to have writ his long impertinent Hiſtory of broken Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; which, I confeſs, I did ſlight when I heard of it, but not ſo much as now I ſee it: For who would go to uſe

ſuch a deceitful <hi>Medium,</hi> as a Hiſtory of broken Succeſſion, to prove an Empire to be Elective? I am ſure, if our Author conſider that Argument better, he will not abide by it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Julian</hi> was <hi>lawfully</hi> poſſeſt of the Empire after <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s Death, but not before; for tho he were choſen Emperor by the Army in <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s Life-time, yet that Choice only made him an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

And this, I doubt not, is what <hi>Ammian.

That is, by <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s Death, it was <hi>Julian</hi>'s of courſe: For as for that Flam, that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> named <hi>Julian</hi> his Succeſſor with his laſt Breath, it is ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous a Falſhood, that the meaneſt Sutler in <hi>Julian</hi>'s Army was not ſilly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to believe it, when it was ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was coming to advance him the other way.</p>

               <p>To anſwer Forty of our Author's trifling Objections at once, ſuch as, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Law of Nature be for Primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Gavelkind too? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I affirm,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there never was a Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World, that was not alterable, and which might not be directed and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, either by the Prince, or People, or, as it is here, by both. The Jewiſh Succeſſion, which was eſtabliſh'd by God himſelf in the Line of <hi>David,</hi> was not ſo eſtabliſh'd, as to exclude the Peoples Governance and Diſpoſal of it. A clear
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66311:72"/>
Inſtance you have of this, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.1. and 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.30. <hi>Then the People of the Land took</hi> Jehoahaz, <hi>the Son of</hi> Joſiah, <hi>and made him King in his Father's ſtead, in</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> was the younger Brother, and yet the People of the Land excluded his elder Brother, to make him King. And tho he were the younger Brother, by about two Years, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture approves the Title and Birth-right, which the People of the Land gave him, for it allows and records him to be the Firſt-born, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And the Sons of</hi> Joſiah <hi>were; the Firſt-born,</hi> Johanan; <hi>the ſecond,</hi> Jehojakim, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This <hi>Joha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> is the ſame with <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> as all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators are agreed; ſuch variety of Names being very uſual in Scripture for the ſame Perſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly; That the Government of the Succeſſion in the Roman Empire, was in the hands of the Emperor; which is the reaſon that <hi>Gregory</hi> blames <hi>Conſtantius</hi> alone, and neither Souldiery nor Senate, for <hi>Julian</hi>'s ſucceeding to the Crown. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3dly; That in all Hereditary King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the Succeſſion has been variouſly ordered and diſpoſed upon occaſion, and that juſtly, by thoſe who had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66311:73"/>
of it. And therefore <hi>Chlorus</hi> might do as was moſt fit, to give his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to his eldeſt Son alone; and yet <hi>Conſtantine</hi> do as well, to divide his lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Empire amongſt his three Sons. Both which ways of inheriting, according to the Fathers, were ſtill by Divine Right. We have a plain Inſtance of this likewiſe in the Articles of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>'s Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Primo</hi> Mar. <hi>Parl.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> in the united Kingdoms of thoſe two Princes.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add, by way of Supererrogation, that the Empire (after <hi>Jovian</hi>'s untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſudden Death) went on again in a way of Hereditary Succeſſion, firſt in <hi>Valentinian</hi>'s, and afterwards in <hi>Theodoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s Family. <hi>Gratian,</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> the younger, ſucceeded <hi>Valentinian,</hi> as his lawful Heirs. So <hi>Symmachus,</hi> Praefect of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">—<hi>Apud</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ. <hi>Ep.</hi> 11.</note> expreſſes it: <hi>Eum Religionis ſtatum petimus, qui divo parenti veſtro cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis ſervavit Imperium, qui fortunato Principi legitimos ſuffecit Haeredes.</hi> One of them was Emperor when he was a Child; but it was all one for that: For as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſays by <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s young Sons, <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſucceeded their Father; <hi>Nec moveat aetas, Imperatoris perfecta aetas:</hi> No-body is to mind their Age, for an Emperor is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66311:73"/>
always at Age. The Deſcent of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown took away all Defects. And St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> exhorts the People and Army to pay the ſame Duty to theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, as they would to <hi>Theodoſius</hi> himſelf, or rather more; and tells them what Sacrilege it would be to violate their Rights: <hi>Plus debetis defuncto,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In a word, if the Empire were not Hereditary, in that period of it which my Diſcourſe led me to ſpeak of, and for a long time after, the Chriſtians, as well as Heathens, have not only impoſed upon the World, but, which is far worſe, have mocked God in their Prayers. <hi>Firmicus</hi> prays the great Sun and Stars,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> together with the moſt High God, to make the Government of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and his Sons, perpetual; and grant, ſays he, that they may reign over our Poſterity, and the Poſterity of our Poſterity, in a continued Series of infinite Ages. <hi>Sozomen</hi> prays,<note place="margin">Dedicat. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.</note> that God would tranſmit <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s Kingdom to his Children's Children. To which Prince, <hi>Cyrill,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſays, <q>The Queen,<note place="margin">De rectâ fide ad <hi>Theod.</hi>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66311:74"/>
in having Children by you, gives hope of Perpetuity to the Empire.</q>
Now from any one of theſe Expreſſions, it is plain that the Empire was not Elective; For every one knows, that the preſent King's Children, in an Elective Kingdom, are fartheſt off from ſucceeding: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſucceeds, they ſhall not, for fear they ſhould alter the Conſtitution of the Kingdom, and make it Hereditary. It is indeed otherwiſe in the Empire of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> but there is a peculiar Reaſon for it: None but the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which has ſo large Hereditary Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Countries, and ſo ſcituate, as to be a Bulwark againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of defending and preſerving that Empire.</p>
               <p>After all, to ſhew how much our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is miſtaken, in thinking the Streſs of my Argument lies upon this Aſſertion, That the Empire was Hereditary in <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s time, (which nevertheleſs I deſire him to confute, if he can, in fourſcore Pages more,) I do aſſure him, that the Concluſions which are drawn from his own Premiſes, will ſerve my Turn as well.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:66311:74"/>Our Author ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 51. <hi>That the</hi> Caeſarſhip <hi>only made a Man Candidate, and Expectant of the Empire</hi>; or, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf afterwards, <hi>it was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to the</hi> Auguſtus-ſhip. Tho by the way, <hi>Candidate</hi> or <hi>Expectant</hi> is not the Engliſh of <hi>Spartianus</hi>'s Latine, which he there quotes; for deſigned or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Heirs of the Imperial Majeſty are more than Candidates; and <hi>Eumenius,</hi> who underſtood the Roman Empire and Language better than any modern Man, oppoſes thoſe two Words to one another: <hi>Sacrum illud palatium, non Candidatus Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii, ſed deſignatus intraſti.</hi> However,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pan.</hi> 8.</note> to take the Character of a <hi>Caeſar</hi> at the very loweſt, he was recommended to the Empire, and ſtood faireſt for it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Empire had generally gone that way, he might plead Cuſtom, tho not a ſtrict Right; and at the leaſt, was next to the Chair. Nevertheleſs the Chriſtians were for ſetting aſide one that had theſe Pretenſions to the Empire of the Roman World, meerly becauſe he was not of their Religion; they would not have a Heathen to reign over them. Now I did not go to ask their Opinion concerning the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and half a dozen Acts of Parliament more; or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66311:75"/>
whether our King and Parliament have not equal power to exclude a Popiſh Succeſſor, as <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had to degrade a Pagan <hi>Caeſar?</hi> Of which I never doubted, nor dare our Author deny it. But my Enquiry was, Whether Paganiſm was a ſufficient Bar to hinder a Man from an Empire? and whether it unqualified him from reigning over Chriſtians? And their Anſwer was, as I have faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it, that it was a great Sin in thoſe who could prevent ſuch a Perſon's coming to the Crown, if they did not do it. And whether an Act of Parliament can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not govern the <hi>Norman</hi> Entail, we will never ask the Fathers. To conclude, if my Compariſon of Popery and Paganiſm hold true, which this Author has been pleaſed to grace and fortify with his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; then the Caſe of Conſcience is thus reſolved by the Fathers: That it is not only juſt to prevent a Popiſh Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor; but that it is a very great Sin in thoſe who can legally prevent him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they do it.</p>
               <p>Again; If <hi>Julian</hi>'s Title were not a Right of Inheritance, but lay in the Choice of the Legions; then <hi>Julian</hi> was already lawful Emperor, while he was in <hi>France,</hi> as well as <hi>Gordianus, Philip,

It ſeems he was afraid, <hi>even then,</hi> that the Chriſtians would put a Spoke in his Cart, and was ſo apprehenſive of meeting with ſome dangerous Rubs from them, that he ſlaviſhly diſſembled his Religion.</p>
               <p>The next thing in the Preface, worth obſerving, is, our Author's taking offence at my general way of ſpeaking concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Behavior of the Chriſtians under <hi>Julian,</hi> that I ſay <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>their,</hi> when only particular Perſons are mentioned.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; Where I have made a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Inference from the Behaviour of particular Perſons, either thoſe Perſons were Fathers themſelves, who by common Conſtruction are Repreſentatives, and deliver to us the Sence of the Church; or elſe the Thing which is done by them, is commended and applauded by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which is the ſame thing as if they had done it themſelves. But a great part of the Inſtances which I give, are the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66311:76"/>
general and publick Acts of great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Church, a Congregation, a City, or the like; not to mention what was done by the whole Church. And therefore theſe Inſtances ought not to be levell'd with thoſe which our Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days, of Things which were done but not owned, and which, as we uſe to ſay, <hi>No-Body</hi> did: For our Author might have had the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Twenty Marks, and Thanks, if he could have inform'd who it was that hang'd up the Cat. And as for <hi>Wyat</hi>'s Rebellion, it was upon account of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, and Religion was only pretended, as our Author's own Quotation from Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg.</p>
               <p>I ſhall overlook the reſt, till I come to his Diſcourſe about the Bill of Excluſion; <hi>where,</hi> in the firſt place, we meet with a <hi>ſubtil</hi> Defence for the <hi>Addreſſers: For it was not the Popiſh Succeſſor, as Popiſh, but the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which they promiſed to maintain.</hi> I like the Diſtinction very well, only our <hi>Author</hi> applies it by the halves; for I wonder he does not ſay, that they made this Promiſe too, not as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but as <hi>Addreſſers.</hi> But it ſeems, the <hi>Suffolk-Proteſtants did
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66311:76"/>
thus maintain the Succeſſion of Queen</hi> Mary. They did ſo, but the Caſe was very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; for then there was no poſſibility of a Bill of Excluſion: Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> by virtue of an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> was actually Queen; and yet they gave her no aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but upon her Promiſe to maintain the eſtabliſhed Proteſtant Religion: Which Promiſe was ſo well and truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that we may well be excuſed from truſting any Popiſh Prince, as thoſe poor Men did, who afterwards had the Opportunity of ſeeing their Error, from the Vantage-Ground of a Pillory, and by the Fire-Light in <hi>Smithfield.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and recanting his being concern'd in ſetting up King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Will againſt an <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament; it manifeſtly makes for me, and ſhews what authority <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> aſcribed to an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> which gave Queen <hi>Mary</hi> all her Title, after he himſelf had been the greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of rendring her Illegitimate, by cauſing her Mother's Marriage to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared null and void from the beginning. Tho I might well have taken no notice of it, becauſe our <hi>Author</hi> is pleaſed to do the ſame by Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi>'s Sermon at <hi>Paul's-Croſs,</hi> where he put by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

And becauſe he appeals to me, whether I think the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England</hi> could pen ſuch a Popiſh or Presbyterian Piece? I anſwer; 1. That I do veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe they did pen that Piece; and further, that there were few others in thoſe Days, who were able to pen ſo learned a Piece. And, 2. I will join iſſue with him when he pleaſes, that it is neither a Popiſh nor Presbyterian Piece, but worthy of the zealous Prelates of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66311:77"/>
that Age, and agreeable to the Doctrine of the Homilies, to which all the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> have ſubſcribed; which is more than can be ſaid of Dr. <hi>Hickes</hi>'s <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culium Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, There is no ground in the World to ſuſpect, but theſe Arguments were part of the Reaſons preſented to the Queen in Parliament, becauſe the Title ſays they were, and it is manifeſt that they are all in the ſame ſtrain, and of a piece; and further, Sir <hi>Simonds</hi> ſays, that then, which was above fifty Years ago, there were written Copies of them remaining in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hands; at which time it was very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, if they had been forged, to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it. 2dly; This Paper of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought not to be called <hi>Anonymous</hi>; for in the Body of it, the Biſhops are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as the Authors of it, whereby the certain Authors of a Book are better known, than by a Title or Inſcription. 3dly; There is nothing in thoſe Reaſons, but what was fit for Biſhops in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to urge; I ſay, in Parliament, where there was full Authority to have enacted all their Concluſions; but had been very improper to urge to a Judg at an Aſſizes: which very different Caſes I am afraid the <hi>Peculium</hi> doth not diſtinguiſh. In
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66311:78"/>
ſhort, thoſe Reaſons are foully miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by this Author, and rendred as only fit to proceed from a <hi>Scotizing Presbyterian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe now I ſhould do the ſame by <hi>Jovian,</hi> and with more Juſtice ſay, it was a Book written by the Prieſts in <hi>Newgate</hi>; as not believing that a Book, which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly carries on <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Deſign, and is made up of the very Doctrine of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration for diſſolving the Parliament, could come from a Miniſter of <hi>London.</hi> This would not be well taken; therefore our Author muſt pardon me, if it raiſes my Indignation, to have a Bench of as Reverend Biſhops as ever were in the World, treated in the ſame manner. And I do again renew my Promiſe, that if he will pleaſe to print the Reaſons of that Parliament at large, as I deſired the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to peruſe them at large, and add a Confutation of the Biſhops Arguments, it ſhall not want an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Is it a Popiſh Piece, becauſe it was for having a Law to put an Idolater to Death? Why then our Homilies are Popiſh too, for commending the Chriſtian Iconoclaſt Emperors, who puniſhed Image-worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and Image-maintainers with Death. Or a Preſbyterian Piece? Truly that is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66311:78"/>
very notably gueſſed. What? becauſe it talks of Godly Biſhops, where it ſays, <q>We ſee not how we can be accounted Godly Biſhops, or faithful Subjects, if in common Peril we ſhould not cry and give warning?</q>
A Scotizing Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian would as ſoon have talkt of black Swans.</p>
               <p>Well, but according to our Author, from excluding the next Heir to the Crown out of the World, there is no Conſequence at all to excluding him from the Crown: I thought there had, but this it is not to be skilled in Jewiſh Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: <hi>For,</hi> he ſays, <hi>a rebellious First-born amongst the Jews might be put to Death, but not diſinherited.</hi> This is the prettieſt Argument in the Book, if it were true; but it is like the reſt, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe. For his own <hi>Selden,</hi> whom he quotes for ſuch a Saying as <hi>Pax est bona,</hi> in the 24<hi>th</hi> Chap. of the very ſame Book, ſhews him ſeveral ways how the Firſt-born, or only Son, or any Son might be diſinherited, and defeated of his Succeſſion. I ſee every Body has not a <hi>Petavius</hi> to direct him. However, a Man that could but read the Engliſh Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bible, might know that a Jewiſh Father had power to diſinherit,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66311:79"/>
becauſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.15. that Power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in one particular Caſe. <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place gives the reaſon of that Reſtraint; ſays he, The Father might for juſt cauſe transfer the Right of the Firſt-born to a younger Brother; but the Law took away that Liberty from a Man who had two Wives together, where there was danger it might be done upon light and trifling Occaſions. And truly the Caſe of an Hebrew Heir had been very hard, if it had been Neck or nothing; if he might by the Law have been put to Death for that, for which he might not be diſinherited. Tho, by the way, the Rabbins ſay, That Law of putting a Son to Death was never practiſed, no more than that of Retaliation, an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth.</p>
               <p>He falſely and invidiouſly ſays: <hi>I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the Houſe of Lords, the three Estates of</hi> Scotland,<note place="margin">But how if the Houſe of Lords did not think the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful?</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c. to give but one Reaſon to prove a Bill of Excluſion to be unlawful.</hi> I did not look ſo high, nor think of thoſe great Perſons, but of thoſe whom I have often converſed with, and who, according to the Character I there gave of them, have furiouſly reproached three ſucceſſive Houſes of Commons upon account of that Bill: And I am afraid I ſhall have
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66311:79"/>
occaſion to call upon them for their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, even after this Author's perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. I always meant thoſe Men who have miſled too many, and too great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into a Belief, that a Bill of Excluſion is againſt both Law and Conſcience; that it is ſuch Injuſtice, as ought not to be done to ſave the World from periſhing: And after they have aſſerted this, and laid it down for Goſpel, are not able to ſay one wiſe Word in defence of it; and till they do, I am ſure all the World will give me leave to follow them with this reaſonable Demand.</p>
               <p n="1">I. His firſt Argument is, <hi>That an Act of Excluſion is void, becauſe it tends to the Diſheriſon of the Crown.</hi> This is ſo far from being true, that an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhould deny the King and Parliament a Power of governing the Succeſſion, would be a proper Act of Diſheriſon of the Crown, becauſe it would deſtroy one of the greateſt Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of the Crown, and deveſt the King of ſuch a Power as is part of his Crown, and which alone, in many Caſes, can ſecure the whole to him. According to what Serjeant <hi>Manwood</hi> affirm'd in Parliament, 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 
                  <q>That as for the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66311:80"/>
Authority of Parliament (in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Crown) it could not in reaſonable Conſtruction be otherwiſe;<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Sim. D'Ewes</hi> Journ. <hi>p.</hi> 165</note> for whoſoever ſhould deny that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, did deny the Queen to be Queen, and the Realm to be a Realm.</q>
The truth of it is, it tears up the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of our Government: For as Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> has expreſt it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chriſt. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> p. 536.</note> 
                  <hi>The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all the Laws of our Country is this, That what the Prince, and moſt Part of her Barons and Burgeſſes ſhall confirm, that ſhall ſtand for Good.</hi> But to come to the Point, this unalterable Norman Entail, whence is it? It was certainly made with hands, tho all the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors had not the Art of making one. Now I aſſert, That the King in his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when ever he pleaſes to call one, has all the Power upon Earth, and full as much as ever was upon Engliſh Ground; and conſequently can govern this <hi>Norman</hi> Entail, as ſhall be moſt for the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Majeſty's Sacred Perſon from Popiſh Plots, and of this Proteſtant Realm from the Helliſh Power of <hi>Rome.</hi> And to deny this, were to diſherit and diſable the Crown,<note place="margin">Journal, <hi>p.</hi> 164.</note> and as Mr. <hi>Mounſon,</hi> in the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> expreſſes it, were an <hi>horrible</hi> Saying.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:66311:80"/>As an Appendix to this firſt Argument, firſt, he asks a ſhrewd Queſtion, <hi>If the Acts of</hi> Hen. VIII. <hi>about Succeſſion were valid, by what Authority was the Houſe of</hi> Suffolk <hi>excluded, and King</hi> James <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Crown, contrary to many Statutes againſt him?</hi> If our Author will ſhew me but one of thoſe many Statutes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by King <hi>James</hi> ſtood excluded, I will yield him the Cauſe. In the mean time, I wonder a Man ſhould offer to make Acts of Parliament no more than waſte Paper, when he knows nothing of them; and to talk of the Houſe of <hi>Suffolk's</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, when it was never included, nor ever had any Title or Pretenſions to the Crown; and above all, to be ſo very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, as to quote the Recognition of the High-Court of Parliament, 1 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 1. where King <hi>James</hi>'s Succeſſion is owned for lawful, when at the ſame time he is invalidating all Acts of Parliament, which limit and determine of the Succeſſion. For as the ſame Mr. <hi>Mounſon</hi> argues, <q>It were horrible to ſay, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath not Authority to determine of the Crown; for then would enſue, not only the annihilating of the Statute 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. but that the Statute made in the firſt Year of her Majeſty's Reign, of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66311:81"/>
                     <hi>Recognition,</hi> ſhould be laid void; a Matter containing a greater Conſequent than is convenient to be uttered.</q>
So that if our Author diſables Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which limit and bind the Deſcent of the Crown, he likewiſe diſables <hi>that</hi> Act of Recognition. Our Author's Partner, Mr. <hi>Long,</hi> has urged this Act of Recognition 1 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> more ſtrongly than any one Argument in his Book beſides; for becauſe it was made ſince the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he oppoſeth it to that, and gives it all the Power of a laſt Will. To which I ſhall only ſay thus much, That the very ſame Recognition, to a tittle, might have been made to King <hi>James,</hi> tho <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had been ſtill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and had only ſtood excluded by Act of Parliament: For, as Mr. <hi>Long</hi> may ſee by the Act before the Common-Prayer-Book, 14 <hi>Carol.</hi> 2. the Law can make great Numbers of Men as if they were <hi>dead,</hi> and <hi>naturally dead,</hi> before their Time; yea, tho many of them had a <hi>Jus divinum</hi> to preach, as being Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ordained, and were deſcended in a right Line from the very Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly; Our Author quotes two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities: The one ſays, <hi>A Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, if it ſhould paſs, would change the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66311:81"/>
Eſſence of the Monarchy, and make the Crown Elective; or, as another ingenious</hi> (but I am ſure very ſcurrilous and irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) <hi>Pen ſaith, it would tend to make a Football of the Crown, and turn an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Kingdom into Elective.</hi> The ſame Anſwer will ſerve them both, namely, That an Act of diſinheriting from the Crown, does own, and proclaim, and prove the Kingdom to be Hereditary. And further, I would be glad to know in what part of the Globe that Elective Kingdom lies, where the very Eſſence of it is this, that the preſent Poſſeſſor of the Crown ſhall have Power in declaring or diſabling his Succeſſor.</p>
               <p n="2">II. His next Argument is from the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Miniſter of <hi>London</hi> eſpecially ought to have uſed no Sophiſtry, becauſe Oaths are ſacred Things, and ought not by falſe Gloſſes and Interpretations to be turn'd into Snares, to entangle the Conſciences of thoſe who hereafter ſhall be deſirous to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, to involve three ſucceſſive Houſes of Commons in the Guilt of Perjury, only for diſcharging their Conſciences to God and their Country. And becauſe our
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66311:82"/>
Author, after he has done thus, ſtands upon his Juſtification, and calls <hi>his Way of Arguing plain and honest,</hi> and ſays, <hi>he is not conſcious of the leaſt Sophistry in it</hi>; I ſhall endeavour to make his Sophiſtry ſtare him in the face. I ſhewed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my Preface, by the moſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Proof that could be produced, that by the Heirs and Succeſſors mentioned in theſe Oaths, are meant Kings and Queens of this Realm of <hi>England:</hi> And if the old Oath of Allegiance at Common-Law, which I there quoted, had not expreſly ſaid ſo; yet Common-Senſe would have taught us the very ſame: For Allegiance ſworn to a Subject muſt needs be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And therefore, as I there argued, it is a Falſhood of very dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to ſay, that any Perſon beſides his Majeſty hath now any Intereſt in thoſe Oaths, or can lay claim to any part of them. Our Author had done well to have anſwered that Argument, before he had fallen to new-vamping of old baffled Fallacies, which I ſhall now examine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the Oath of Supremacy,</hi> (as he ſays true) <hi>we are ſworn, to our Power to aſſist and defend all Juriſdictions, Privileges, Preheminencies, and Authorities, granted or belonging to the Kings Highneſs, his Heirs
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:66311:82"/>
and lawful Succeſſors, united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</hi> Now one of theſe Juriſdictions, granted or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the King's Highneſs, his Heirs and lawful Succeſſors, united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, is this, <hi>That the King, with and by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>is able to make Laws and Statutes, of ſufficient force and validity to limit and bind the Crown of this Realm, and the Deſcent, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, Inheritance, and Government thereof.</hi> And therefore I ask, if they be not the perjured Perſons, who by aſſerting an unalterable Succeſſion, endeavour to deſtroy this Juriſdiction, Privilege, and Authority, which they are ſworn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? But our Author's <hi>honeſt way of arguing,</hi> is to have four Terms in a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm. As thus; We are ſworn to defend the Rights of Supremacy veſted in the King; <hi>Ergo,</hi> we are bound to defend an unalterable Succeſſion, which is contrary to the Rights of this Supremacy. Again, we are ſworn to defend all Privileges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the King's Heirs and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, that is, Kings and Queens of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; Ergo,</hi> we are ſworn to defend all the Privileges belonging to ſuch as are neither Kings nor Queens, but Subjects of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66311:83"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> and if they be excluded, never can be Kings or Queens of <hi>England.</hi> And therefore to our Author's firſt Queſtion, I anſwer: No Subject can poſſibly have undoubted, tranſcendent, and eſſential Rights, Privileges, and Preheminencies, united to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi>; for if ſo, then the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> is united to his Rights; which I would deſire our Author to take heed of affirming, for we can have but one Soveraign, as there is but one Sun in the Firmament. To his ſecond Queſtion, I anſwer; By lawful Succeſſors, is meant Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> which have not been always <hi>next Heirs by Proximity of Blood</hi>; witneſs <hi>Henry</hi> 7. Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who could not be both Heirs in that manner to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> And further, I ſay, that the Oath of Supremacy only binds us to the King in being, and not to the whole Royal Family, otherwiſe we ſhould have a great many Soveraigns at once; and it is made in our Author's Phraſe, <hi>for the Behoof</hi> and Intereſt of the Crown, and not for the <hi>Behoof</hi> of him who may never be concern'd in it.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we have theſe Words: <hi>Some indeed have ſaid, with our
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66311:83"/>
Author, that the Oath of Supremacy is a Proteſtant Oath, and ſo could not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a Sence deſtructive to the Proteſtant Religion; which is a meer Shift, and proves nothing, becauſe it proves too much.</hi> Sir, I think it was much more a Shift, to find out a way to drive on the Popes Intereſt by an Oath, which does moſt ſolemnly renounce him; and under a pretence of unalterable Succeſſion, of which there is not the leaſt ſhadow in this Oath, but the direct contrary, to abandon this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Kingdom to the Helliſh Tyranny of <hi>Rome,</hi> which we are ſworn to oppoſe, and all Proteſtants will oppoſe, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Popiſh Succeſſor, if any ſuch can be in <hi>England</hi>; and let Dr. <hi>Watſon</hi> prove it, if he can, to be no leſs than reſiſting the Ordinance of God. But methinks it had been time enough to offer to prove that, after the Pope's Power had been re-eſtabliſhed by a Law, and not to go about it now, when it is Treaſon to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reconcile Men to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus much the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy proves, which is not <hi>nothing,</hi> nor a Jot <hi>too much.</hi> And further, it proves, that we are bound, in order to the keeping out the Pope's Power, which we have utterly renounced, humbly to beg
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66311:84"/>
of his Majeſty to forecloſe a Popiſh Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, who will infallibly let it in. I am ſure, this way of aſſiſting and defending the Juriſdictions and Authorities of the Crown is <hi>in our Power,</hi> and ſo is within the compaſs of our Oath; and therefore we are treacherous to the Crown, and falſe to our Oath, as well as to God, and to our Religion, if we will not do ſo much for any of them as this comes to. And I do ſeriouſly and earneſtly recommend this Conſideration to all that have taken the Oath of Supremacy, and eſpecially to the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> who have taken it ſeveral times over.</p>
               <p>As for our Author's ſaying, <hi>That mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Papists will take the Oath of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>; I ſhall only ſay this to it, Let him ſhew me a Man that has taken this Oath, and prove him to be a Papiſt, and I will prove him perjured.</p>
               <p>Again, he ſays, <hi>As theſe are Protestant Oaths, they bind us the more emphatically to aſſist and defend the King against the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation of the Pope, who pretends to a Power of depoſing Kings, and of excluding Hereditary Princes from the Succeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are bound emphatically to renounce all Power of the Pope, and therefore this among the reſt; but we
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66311:84"/>
are bound to aſſert many Inſtances of that Power to the King, which we deny to the Pope, of which I have proved the Power of excluding a Popiſh Prince to be one: Which if the Pope himſelf exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes upon Proteſtant Princes, where he but pretends to be Supream; he is a Wretch if he complains, or any Body for him, that the like is done by them who really are Supream. This, in ſhort, is your <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>honest Arguing:</hi> We are ſworn to deny the Pope's uſurped Power; <hi>Ergo,</hi> we are ſworn to deny the King's juſt and lawful Power, which by the ſame Oath we are bound to maintain.</p>
               <p>In the next Paragraph, our Author <hi>protests to all the World,</hi> that he has ſworn Allegiance and Supremacy to Subjects, or to the unalterable Succeſſion, or to I know not what, for he is not very clear. But as for all others, who have taken no ſuch raſh and unlawful Oath, they need <hi>no Abſolution</hi> from it; and conſequently, <hi>there had not been ſuch a World of Popery in the Bill of Excluſion upon that Score.</hi> And therefore I deſire our Author not to trouble his Head about it; and he may ſpeak to the Great Man, whom he quotes for that notable Obſervation, to do ſo too. If he himſelf has been ſo forward, as to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66311:85"/>
ſwear before-hand to a Subject, he has done it in his own Wrong, and he knows how by Repentance to diſengage himſelf from a raſh, void, and unlawful Oath; for he ought to have ſworn only to our Sovereign Lord the King that now is, and to his Highneſs Heirs and lawful Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, Kings or Queens of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and other his Dominions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the ſame.</p>
               <p>I never in my Life read any thing of that kind with greater pleaſure, than his Concluſion of this ſecond Argument; to ſee a Man bewildred, and confounded, and loſt in his own Sophiſtry. I took notice in my Preface, of an Abuſe in Common Speech, where Men that are only in poſſibility of being Heirs, are called Heirs, next Heirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which abſurd and dangerous Sence ſome weak Men have taken the Heirs and Succeſſors mentioned in the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon were againſt a Bill of Excluſion. I then proved it, and therefore had the confidence to call it a <hi>deceitful Prejudice,</hi> and muſt now add, that it is a very <hi>ſilly Prejudice,</hi> becauſe every Bill, Bond, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, and almoſt any other Writing, that paſſes in common Intercourſe among
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:66311:85"/>
Men, wherein Heirs are mentioned, is ſufficient to correct it; for where Men are concerned to ſpeak properly, Heirs are always underſtood to be thoſe who actually inherit. Now as in a Covenant, I promiſe to pay <hi>A. B.</hi> and to his Heirs, the yearly Rent of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, one Farthing to his eldeſt Son, or without being bound that his eldeſt Son ſhall be his Heir after his Death, or without being obliged not to expreſs a deſire that <hi>A. B.</hi> would diſinherit his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son, if he have given manifeſt proof that he will utterly ruine the Eſtate and Family: So it is in theſe Oaths, with this difference, That it would be only the Abſurdity and Inconvenience of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Rent twice over, to take Heirs, for <hi>poſſible Heirs,</hi> in this lower and more familiar Inſtance of a Covenant, whereas it would involve us in Treaſon, to take Heirs in that Sence in the Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and Supremacy. But this uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable Man will have them taken in both Sences in theſe Oaths. Heirs and Succeſſors, in the very ſame place, ſhall ſignify Subjects, and not Subjects, but Kings and Queens. Heirs ſhall ſtand for thoſe that actually inherit, and not for them, but for thoſe that may, and may
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:66311:86"/>

               <p>In one word, Heirs and lawful Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, in the Oaths of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, muſt either ſignify Kings and Queens, (as the Oath of Allegiance at Common-Law expounds it ſelf, which the Lawyers call, <hi>Benedicta expoſitio ex viſceribus cauſae,</hi> a bleſſed Expoſition out of the Bowels of the Cauſe) or elſe they muſt ſignify Subjects; for it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious, and Tranſubſtantiation-Non-ſence, to ſay they ſignify both. If they ſignify Kings and Queens, then we are no ways bound to any Perſon under that degree by thoſe Oaths; and they have been very unfairly as well as miſchievouſly urged againſt a Bill of Excluſion. If any Man ſay, they ſignify Subjects, then this grievous Inconvenience unavoidably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That we have promiſed, <hi>from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,</hi> that is, from the Time we were ſworn, and ſo onwards, <hi>to bear them Faith and true Allegiance</hi>; which, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, no Miniſter of <hi>London,</hi> nor Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State in <hi>England,</hi> will think fit to affirm.</p>

                  <note rend="inter">
                     <hi>Quere,</hi> Whether <hi>Dei Gratiâ,</hi> written with the very ſame Letters and Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables in the Stile of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and of the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> does alſo prove an hereditary, and, which is much more, an unalterable Succeſſion, in thoſe two Countries?</note> 
                  <hi>Dieu &amp; Mon droit,</hi> &amp;c. all equally concluding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Bill of Excluſion. The main Argument, for which he quotes <hi>Cook</hi> upon <hi>Littleton,</hi> of Tenures, is this: <hi>The Inheritance of our Lord the King is a direct Dominion, of which none is the Author, but God alone.</hi> The King holds of none but God; <hi>He has no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Lord,</hi> as <hi>Cook</hi> explains himſelf in the ſame place; the Crown is no <hi>Norman</hi> Fee: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the King cannot bind and limit the Succeſſion. I thought he could the ſooner for that; for what ſhall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from diſpoſing of his own, for the Welfare, and with the Conſent of his Kingdom, who have a greater Intereſt in their King than our Author is aware of.</p>
               <p>From the aforeſaid Principle, he gives us to underſtand that the Wiſe and the Learned infer this Concluſion, <hi>That it would be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, without a manifeſt Revelation from God, to preclude any Perſon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66311:87"/>
of the Royal Family from ſucceeding to the Crown.</hi> The Learned may do much; but I will go upon his Errand an hundred Miles an end, who will ſhew any other Man how to infer that Concluſion from that Argument. But for all that, they ſhew themſelves neither learned, nor wiſe, in calling for a manifeſt Revelation from God for a Bill of Excluſion, becauſe that may occaſion others to demand a manifeſt Revelation for any Papiſt's Right to ſucceed in a Proteſtant Kingdom, where, by the Laws of that Kingdom, if he be reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he has not a Right to live: A manifeſt Revelation to ſhew, why a <note n="*" rend="inter">Bp. <hi>Bilſon,</hi> pag. <hi>420.</hi> Extreme Folly and Frenzy be juſt Cauſes to remove Princes from bearing the Sword. <hi>Margin. And in the Text thus:</hi> As if the Right Heir to any Crown be a natural Fool; or he that is inveſted in the Crown, wax mad, and run beſides himſelf: In either of theſe two Caſes, any Realm, by publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Advice, may chuſe another.</note> Natural Fool or Mad-man, who cannot help it, may be put by the Succeſſion, as not fit to govern; but a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, who is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and deſtructive to a Proteſtant Kingdom than both of them, and that by his own Fault too, may not be prevented. In a Word, a manifeſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſhew, how a publick Enemy, as every Perſon who is reconciled to the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66311:87"/>
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in the Eye of the Law, can poſſibly be the Fountain of Juſtice and Mercy, which is the true Notion of an Engliſh King. Theſe things do ſtand more in need of a manifeſt Revelation to clear them up, than a Bill of Excluſion does, which is as manifeſtly lawful, as that the King and Parliament have power to make a juſt and neceſſary Law.</p>
               <p>Beſides, where was the Wiſdom of our Author, or his Friends, in demanding a Revelation from God for a neceſſary Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Succeſſion, when they themſelves cannot pretend to one for the Eſtabliſhment of it? Since it is an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Maxime, both in Law and Reaſon, that <hi>Things are diſſolved, as they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted</hi>; and an Obligation only by Word of Mouth, needs not Hand and Seal to diſcharge it. For by theſe unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Demands, which are contrary to the known Laws of the Kingdom, they put Men upon Enquiries nice and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: As how, and for what cauſe the Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> came to be Hereditary? And whether a Popiſh Prince does not perfectly overthrow that excellent Conſtitution, and diſinherit himſelf? This is laid down for a known and acknowledged Truth, in the Reaſons

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66311:90"/>
ſeem to deny it, eſpecially in the ſecond part of the Homily for Whit-Sunday; for that whole Sermon is ſpent in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, firſt, what the true Church of Chriſt is, and then in conferring the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> therewith, to diſcern how well they agree together; and, laſtly, in concluding, that becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome is not the true Church of Chriſt; and the Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>and their Adherents, are not in the Church,</hi> therefore they have not the Holy-Ghoſt, tho they have for a long time made a ſore Challenge thereunto; but by their Practices make it plain to all the World, that they have the Spirit of the Devil. It affirms, and, which is more, proves, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is not a true Church, nor has been theſe nine hundred Years, and odd.</hi> So that our Author muſt go a great way back to ſeek his true Church of <hi>England,</hi> in his true Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <head>AN ANSWER TO THE BOOK.</head>
               <p>HAving now done with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, before I return an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to any part of the Book, I ſhall ſet down the Subſtance of it, whereby the Reader will be enabled to judg what parts of it do require an Anſwer. The Deſign of my Book was to ſhew, that the Primitive Chriſtians would have been for a Bill of Excluſion; which I proved, by ſhewing how much they were againſt a Pagan Succeſſor, both by their hearty Wiſhes he had been fore-cloſed,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66311:91"/>
and by their Uneaſineſs under him, when he was Emperor.</p>
               <p>Our Author anſwers the former of theſe Proofs, by endeavouring to ſhew that the Empire was not Hereditary, which I have already conſidered in the Preface. And as for the other Proof, which was the Behaviour of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans toward <hi>Julian,</hi> when he was Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, it is all Matter of Fact; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho our Author wrangles, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes many Cavils about it, ſome of which I ſhall examine anon, yet he cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove one Syllable of it. Now this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument concludes <hi>à fortiori</hi> thus: Would not the Chriſtians have petitioned at leaſt for <hi>Julian</hi>'s Excluſion, when he was a Subject, ſeeing they ſpent ſo many Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Tears for his Deſtruction, when he was Emperor? Would that whole Church, which leaped for Joy, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed at his untimely and violent Death, have ſcrupled his Excluſion? Would they have thought <hi>Julian</hi> wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in being barred from ſucceeding to the Empire, who thought themſelves wronged and injured, in that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> did not kill him, inſtead of making him <hi>Caeſar?</hi>

                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:66311:92"/>The Behaviour of the Chriſtians was ſo very rough towards <hi>Julian,</hi> that I could not aſcribe it wholly to his being a Pagan, but ſhewed, that his Illegal Oppreſſion and Tyranny was alſo the cauſe why they purſued him with ſo much Hatred. The Subſtance of our Author's Anſwer to this is, That <hi>Julian</hi> could not oppreſs them illegally, if he would, <hi>becauſe it was his Royal Pleaſure to have the Chriſtians ſuffer after this manner; and his Will,</hi> according to <hi>Gregory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 90, 91.</note> 
                  <hi>was an unwritten Law, and much ſtronger than the written ones, which were not back'd with Power and Authority.</hi> Yes, that is <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Complaint, and the very illegal Oppreſſion againſt which he exclaims, That when the Chriſtians were under the Protection of the Publick Laws and Edicts, yet they were deſtroyed by dumb Signs, and private Hints, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes upon a meer preſumption of the Emperor's Pleaſure. And whoever will pleaſe to read <hi>Jacob. Gothofredus</hi> his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, ſive de Principe legibus ſoluto,</hi> will ſee how much our Author has perverted and miſapplied all the Shreds of Civil Law, which he hath made uſe of upon this occaſion. In ſhort, our Author grants, that the Chriſtians were highly provoked againſt <hi>Julian</hi>; but then he
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66311:92"/>
ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 182. <hi>The main Ground of their Diſpleaſure againſt him was this, That he would not formally perſecute them, nor put them to Death enough.</hi> As for the word, <hi>Formally,</hi> we find that explained, <hi>p.</hi> 133. <hi>He put them not to Death formally, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but accuſed and condemned them for other Crimes.</hi> Now this is one Inſtance which I gave of his illegal Oppreſſion and Tyranny, that being it did not ſtand with his Conveniences, to enact Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Laws againſt Chriſtianity, he found out ways of putting the Chriſtians to Death, upon falſe and pretended Crimes of Sacrilege and Treaſon: So that tho they died meerly for their Religion, yet they had not the Honour of dying for it, but ſuffered under the Character of the greateſt Malefactors, and both they and their Reputation were murdered at once. This indeed was a juſt Cauſe of their Diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Julian</hi>; but I cannot ſay, with our Author, that they were diſpleaſed at him, <hi>becauſe he did not put them to Death enough</hi>; for I thought he had given them their Belly-full of that.

Were there no Halters nor Precipices in the Roman Empire, but muſt Heaven and Earth be moved againſt <hi>Julian</hi> for this, <hi>becauſe he would not put them to Death enough?</hi> I can only ſay, 'Tis very much!</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe about <hi>Julian</hi>'s illegal Oppreſſion of the Chriſtians, and their Behaviour thereupon towards him, led me to ſpeak of the Duty of Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or ſuffering for our Religion, which I aſſerted to be our Duty only then, when the Laws are againſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and ſhewed, that Chriſtianity does not oblige us to ſubmit to illegal Violence, but to defend our ſelves againſt it. I found a Neceſſity for the true ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Duty, becauſe the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience has been ſo handled of late, as to tempt Oppreſſion and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny into the World, by preſſing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mens Conſciences as a neceſſary Duty, that they ought to ſubmit to the moſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Oppreſſion, and illegal deſtructive Violence. I ſhewed, that by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in the Caſe of a Popiſh Succeſſor, (which is no impoſſible Caſe, witneſs the Expedient at <hi>Oxford</hi>) we ſhould be ready bound hand and foot, to invite the Popiſh Knife; it would expoſe a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66311:93"/>
whole Proteſtant People and Nation at once, and give them but one Neck, which a Popiſh Succeſſor, by the Principles of his Religion, is bound to cut off. In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this Doctrine our Author ſpends the Remainder of his Book; to which, as being a matter of the greateſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I ſhall immediately apply my ſelf, and conſider the Arguments which he has brought for it.</p>
               <p>That I may avoid all Obſcurity in an Argument of this weight and importance, wherein the Lives of all Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and their Poſterity, are concerned, I ſhall,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Shew how far this Author and I are perfectly agreed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. State the Difference betwixt us.</p>
               <p>We are both agreed,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the King's Perſon is Sacred and inviolable by Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That inferior Magiſtrates, acting by the King's Authority according to Law, may not be reſiſted.</p>
               <p>And therefore neither the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor his Authority, are any ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this Controverſy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:66311:94"/>But in the ſecond place, it is ſomewhat more difficult to ſtate the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us; for never was there ſuch a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus</hi> of Paſſive Doctrine as this is. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, by tracing him carefully quite through this Argument, I find his Sence to be this: That by the Imperial Laws, or Laws of the Prerogative, in caſe the Forces of a Popiſh and Tyrannical Prince do outrage and murther the Liege People of <hi>England,</hi> contrary to the Political Laws, that is, the Common and Statute-Laws, which declare the Fundamental Propriety that the People of <hi>England</hi> have in their Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates, thoſe Forces may not be reſiſted; for they who in their own Defence do reſiſt them with Arms, may be legally hanged for it in this World, and (without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) will be damned for it in that which is to come.</p>
               <p>And yet this Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 274. aſſerts, <hi>That the Laws of all Governments allow every Man to defend his Life againſt an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Aſſaſſin; and he that doth not ſo when he can, dies not like a Martyr, but a Fool.</hi> Now Forces thus employed are no other than illegal Aſſaſſins. But, it may be, the Damnableneſs of reſiſting lies in reſiſting
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66311:94"/>
them with Arms? No, it is not that; for our Author in the ſame place ſays, <hi>Contra Sicarium quilibet homo est miles:</hi> Any Man is a lawful Souldier againſt a Cut-Throat; that is, may uſe a Sword againſt him, and not only a Switch. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it their being called the King's or Sovereign's Forces, which makes them irreſiſtible; for, <hi>p.</hi> 280, he allows, that a Man may defend himſelf againſt an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin <hi>ſent by the King's Order; becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the King's Law, which is his moſt Authoritative Command, allows us (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) that Benefit.</hi> And therefore it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that the Damnableneſs of reſiſting them lies in this, that they are Forces, and murther in Troops: So that tho any Man is a lawful Souldier againſt a Cut-Throat, yet no Man is a lawful Souldier againſt Cut-Throats; and indeed this laſt Particular is the only Thing, wherein our Author has not been pleaſed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now in oppoſition to our Author, I hold, That if the Sovereign cannot au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize one ſingle Perſon to do an Act of illegal Violence; much leſs can he autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize Forces, or great Numbers of Men, to do ſuch illegal Acts: And that there is juſt the ſame Reaſon, Law, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66311:95"/>
a thouſand times over, to reſiſt a thouſand Murtherers, that there is to reſiſt one.</p>
               <p>His Concluſions, I confeſs, are very terrible to Fleſh and Blood; but I take comfort, when I look back upon the Principles from whence he infers them, which are abſurdly falſe, and ſo far from ſupporting that Battery which he raiſes upon them, that they fall with their own Weakneſs, Rottenneſs, and Incoherency. His Principles are, an unlimited, bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Soveraign Power; two Tables of Laws, which break one another; ſome Preambles of Statutes, which he ſtifles, and will not ſuffer to ſpeak out, and a falſe Pretence of the Soveraign's Honour.</p>
               <p>Firſt; He begins with the Notion of a Soveraign, <hi>p.</hi> 200. by which all the World may ſee, that he no more underſtands what an Engliſh Soveraign is, than I know what <hi>Preſter John</hi> is. Does not every Body know, that the very ſame Titles of Power and Office have a ſeveral Notion in ſeveral Countries? As, to compare great Things with ſmall, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable in <hi>England</hi> is conceived under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notion than a Conſtable in <hi>France.</hi> And ſo tho an <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived under the Notion of Abſoluteneſs,

                  <hi>whom he would, he ſlew; and whom he would, he made alive; whom he would, he ſet up; and whom he would, he pulled down</hi>; and his Will did all: Yet this is quite contrary to the Notion of an Engliſh King; as <hi>Bracton</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 8.</note>

(as far as humane Prudence can provide) the Conveniencies of all three, without the Inconveniencies of any one.</q>
But we have ſome little People riſen up amongſt us, who with a Daſh of their Pen will new-mould the Government, endeavouring, as much as in them is, to diſſolve this excellent Frame, and to change it into an abſolute Monarchy. The eſtabliſh'd Conſtitution does not agree with the new Models they have ſeen abroad, nor with the new Notions they have got by the end; and therefore, tho it be the Product of the long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, of the deepeſt Inſight, and of the united Wiſdom of a whole Nation; yet it muſt give place to new Inventions, and ſubmit to be regulated by an Epiſtle of a French Author.

likewiſe the Prerogatives of the King, <hi>which are built upon the ſame Law of the Land,</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:66311:97"/>And yet our Author is pleaſed to call ſuch Wretches, ſo employed, the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign's Forces, and his Armies,</hi> p. 203, 221, againſt which we muſt not, upon pain of Damnation, defend our ſelves. I appeal to all the Lawyers of <hi>England,</hi> whether the Law will own any Number of Men to be authorized by the King, in outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and deſtroying his Liege People; or whether it be not a great Aggravation of their Crime, to pretend a Commiſſion from the King, to warrant ſuch illegal and deſtructive Violence? But this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who is reſolved to be an Advocate for Bloodſhed and Oppreſſion, will ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Aſſociation of Murtherers under his common Laws of Soveraignty; and if they ravage and deſtroy in the King's Name, which doubles the Crime, will make that their Protection: And laſtly, (which is the great Cheat that runs through this whole Diſcourſe) to make them irreſiſtible, he ſhrouds and covers them under the Name of the Soveraign. For it is plain, that in his Anſwer to my five Propoſitions, <hi>p.</hi> 204, 205. and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally throughout the following Chapters, by <hi>Sovereign</hi> he means <hi>ſuch Forces of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign</hi>; for he bears me witneſs, <hi>p.</hi> 221. that I acknowledged even a Popiſh Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign

I know that deceiving Men for their Good, has heretofore been excuſed as a pious Fraud; but I am ſure, that ſuch foul Practice as this, to enſnare Mens Conſciences, and to cheat them out of their Lives, is an impious Fraud; and as ſuch, I leave it with the Author of it, and paſs to the</p>
               <p>Second Thing; His Diſtinction of Imperial and Political Laws. Common Law we know, and Statute-Law we know; but who are ye?

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 210. we have theſe Words: <hi>Thus the Learned Chancellor</hi> Forteſcue <hi>grants the King of</hi> England <hi>to have Regal or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Power, altho it be under the Reſtraint
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66311:98"/>
and Regulation of the Power Political, as to the Exerciſe thereof.</hi> That Diſtinction in the laſt Clauſe is falſe, as I ſhall ſhew anon. From that perverted Paſſage of Chancellor <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> where he ſpeaks of Regal and Politick Dominion, I doubt not but our Author, or ſome Body for him, framed his new Diſtinction of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial and Political Laws, and contrived them into two contradictious Tables; by one of which the Subjects Rights and Properties are ſecured and eſtabliſhed, and are all overthrown by the other.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor <hi>Forteſcue</hi> is the firſt Engliſh Lawyer that uſed the Terms of Regal and Politick Government, which he owns to have borrowed from <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Regimine Principum,</hi> dedicated to the King of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> by which Phraſe that old School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man expreſt a mixed and limited Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy: For any Man that pleaſes to read thoſe Books, will ſee, that <hi>Aquinas</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands by Regal Government, an abſolute Monarchy; and by Politick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch Governments as the Common-wealths of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi>; and by Regal and Politick, a King ruling by a Senate, and preſcribed Rules of Law. And that Chancellor <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> in his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:66311:99"/>
Dialogue with the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> makes no other uſe of the Phraſe than <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> did, will ſufficiently appear, by ſetting down his Diſcourſe at large; wherein I deſire the Reader's Patience, becauſe I intend it as a Specimen of this Anſwerer's Faithfulneſs in quoting his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: In which Diſcourſe, that great Lawyer ſometimes calls this Government Regal and Politick, ſometimes a Politick Kingdom; but what he means by it, is beſt expreſt in his own Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. You ſtand in doubt, <hi>most worthy Prince,</hi> whether it be better for you, to give your Mind to the Study of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> or of the Civil Laws, becauſe they throughout the whole World are advanced in Glory and Renown, above all other Humane Laws: Let not this Scruple of Mind trouble you, <hi>most noble Prince</hi>; for the King of <hi>England</hi> cannot alter nor change the Laws of his Realm at his pleaſure. For why, he governeth his People by Power, not only <hi>Royal,</hi> but alſo <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> If his Power over them were <hi>Royal</hi> only, then he might change the Laws of his Realm, and charge his Subjects with Tallage, and other Burdens, without
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66311:99"/>
their conſent; and ſuch is the Dominion which the Civil Laws purport, when they ſay, <hi>The Prince's Pleaſure hath the Force of a Law.</hi> But from this much differeth the Power of a King, whoſe Government over his People is <hi>Politick:</hi> For he can neither change the Laws without the conſent of his Subjects, nor yet charge them with ſtrange Impoſitions againſt their Wills. Wherefore his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do frankly and freely enjoy their own Goods, being ruled by ſuch Laws as they themſelves deſire; neither are they pilled by their own King, or by any Body elſe. Like Pleaſure alſo and Freedom have the Subjects of a King ruling by Power Royal only, ſo long as he falleth not into Tyranny. Of ſuch a King ſpeaketh <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the 3<hi>d</hi> Book of his Politicks, ſaying, <hi>That it is better for a City to be governed by a good King, than by a good Law.</hi> But foraſmuch as a King is not ever ſuch a Man, therefore St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in the Book which he wrote to the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> of the <hi>Governance of Princes,</hi> wiſheth the State of a Realm to be ſuch, that it may not be in the King's Power at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to oppreſs his People with Tyranny, which Thing is accompliſhed, only
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:66311:100"/>
when the Power Royal is reſtrained by a Politick Law. Rejoyce therefore, <hi>most worthy Prince,</hi> and be glad, that the Law of the Realm wherein you are to ſucceed, is ſuch; for it ſhall exhibit and miniſter to you, and your People, no ſmall Security and Comfort. With ſuch Laws, as ſaith St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſhould all Mankind have been governed, if in Paradiſe they had not tranſgreſſed God's Commandment: With ſuch Laws alſo was the Synagogue ruled, while it was under God only as King, who adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame to him for a peculiar King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but at the laſt, when at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt they had a Man-King ſet over them, they were then, under Royal Laws only, brought very low.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. Then the Prince thus ſaid; How cometh it to paſs, good Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, <hi>that one King may govern his People by Power Royal only, and that another King can have no ſuch Power?</hi> Seeing both theſe Kings are in Dignity equal, I cannot chuſe but much muſe and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, why in Power they ſhould thus differ.</q>
Of which Difference in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over their Subjects, the Chancellor in the next Chapter promiſes to ſhew the Reaſon, which is grounded upon
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:66311:100"/>
the different Originals of thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. And accordingly, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. he ſhews, that an Abſolute Monarchy is founded in the forced Conſent of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and inſlaved People; and, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. That a Kingdom of Politick Governance is founded in the voluntary Conſent of the Community. And after he has il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated the firſt Inſtitution of a Politick Kingdom, by ſhewing how it reſembles the Formation of a natural Body, he thus proceeds in the 13<hi>th</hi> Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now you underſtand, <hi>most noble Prince,</hi> the Form of Inſtitution of a Kingdom Politick, whereby you may meaſure the Power, which the King thereof may exerciſe over the Law and Subjects of the ſame. For ſuch a King is made and ordained for the Defence of the Law of his Subjects, and of their Bodies and Goods, whereunto he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Power of his People, ſo that he cannot govern his People by any other Power. Wherefore to ſatisfy your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, in that you deſire to be certified, how it cometh to paſs that in the Power of Kings there is ſo great diverſity: Surely in mine Opinion, the diverſity of the Inſtitutions, or firſt Ordinances of thoſe Dignities, which I have now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66311:101"/>
is the only Cauſe of this foreſaid Difference, as of the Premiſes by the Diſcourſe of Reaſon you may eaſily gather. For thus the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> out of <hi>Brute</hi>'s <note n="*" place="margin">Comitiva.</note> Retinue of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans,</hi> which he brought out of the Coaſts of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> firſt grew to a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick and Regal Dominion. Thus alſo <hi>Scotland,</hi> which ſometime was ſubject to <hi>England,</hi> as a Dukedom thereof, was advanced to a Politick and Royal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Many other Kingdoms alſo had thus their firſt beginning, not only of Regal, but alſo of Politick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> in his ſecond Book of ancient Hiſtory, thus writeth of the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings lived at firſt, not after the licentious manner of other Rulers, whoſe Will and Pleaſure is inſtead of Law; but as it had been private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they were bound by the Law; neither did they think much at it, being perſuaded, that by obeying the Laws they ſhould be happy: For by ſuch Rulers, as followed their own Luſts, they thought many Things were done, whereby they ſhould incur divers Harms and Perils. And in his fourth Book, thus he writeth: The <hi>Ethiopian</hi> King,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:66311:101"/>
as ſoon as he is created, he ordereth his Life according to the Laws, and doth all things after the Manner and Cuſtom of his Country, aſſigning nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reward nor Puniſhment to any Man, other than the Law made by his Predeceſſors appointeth. He reporteth much the ſame of the King of <hi>Saba,</hi> in <hi>Arabia Faelix</hi>; and of certain other Kings, which in old Time reigned happily.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. To whom the <hi>Prince</hi> thus anſwered: You have, good Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, with the clear Light of your Declaration, diſpelled the Clouds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with my Mind was darkned; ſo that I do moſt evidently ſee, that no Nation did ever of their own voluntary Mind incorporate themſelves into a Kingdom, for any other Intent, but only to the end that they might enjoy their Lives and Fortunes (which they were afraid of loſing) with greater Security than before. And of this Intent ſhould ſuch a Nation be utterly defrauded, if then their King might ſpoil them of their Goods, which before was lawful for no Man to do. And yet ſhould ſuch a People be much more injured, if they ſhould afterwards be governed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66311:102"/>
by foreign and ſtrange Laws, yea, and ſuch as they peradventure deadly hated and abhorred. And moſt of all, if by thoſe Laws their Subſtance ſhould be diminiſhed, for the Safeguard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as alſo for the Security of their Perſons, they of their own accord ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to the Governance of a King. No ſuch Power for certain could proceed from the People them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and yet, unleſs it had been from the People themſelves, ſuch a King could have had no Power at all over them. Now on the other ſide, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to ſtand much otherwiſe with a Kingdom, which is incorporate by the King's ſole Power and Authority, becauſe ſuch a Nation is ſubject to him upon no other Terms, but that this Nation, which was made his Kingdom by his Will and Pleaſure, ſhould obey and be governed by his Laws, which are nothing elſe but the ſame Will and Pleaſure. Neither have I yet, good Chancellor, forgotten that, which in your Treatiſe of the Nature of the Law of Nature, you have learnedly proved, that the Power of theſe two Kings is equal; while the Power of the one, whereby he is at liberty to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66311:102"/>
deal wrongfully, is not by ſuch Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty augmented; as to have Power to decay and die, is not Power, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Privations which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, is rather to be called Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and Want of Power, becauſe, as <hi>Boetius</hi> ſaith, Power is not but to Good. So that to be able to do Evil, (which the King who rules Regally is more at liberty to do, than the King that has a Politick Dominion over his People) is rather a Diminution than an Increaſe of his Power: For the Holy Spirits, which are now eſtabliſhed in Glory, and cannot ſin, do in Power far excell and paſs us, who have a delight and pleaſure to run headlong into all kind of Wickedneſs.</q>

where he tells us, that ſome of the former Kings of <hi>England</hi> would fain have changed the Laws of <hi>England</hi> for the Civil Law,<note place="margin">Cap. 33. fol. 78. a.</note> and <hi>did all they could to ſhake off this Politick Yoke of the Law of</hi> England, <hi>that they alſo might rule, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rage over their Subjects in Regal wiſe only</hi>;<note place="margin">Cap. 37. f. 88. a.</note> and for this end, <hi>endeavoured with might and main to caſt away their Politick Government.</hi> This is what our Author would have, and very agreeable to his Hypotheſis; for then the Regal or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Power had been diſcharged of the Politick Clog, and had governed all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; and the Notions of Sovereignty and Paſſive Obedience, had been as clear as the Sun.

               <p>And now I appeal to all the World, whether here be any Foundation for a Table of Imperial Laws, which can at

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall add but one remarkable Paſſage more, out of the King's Anſwer to both Houſes concerning the <hi>Militia, Feb.</hi> 28. 1641. <q>And his Majeſty is willing to grant every of them ſuch Commiſſions, as he hath done this Parliament to ſome Lords Lieutenants by your Advice; but if that Power be not thought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but that more ſhall be thought fit to be granted to theſe Perſons named, <hi>than by the Law is in the Crown it ſelf,</hi> his Majeſty holds it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,

that the ſame be by <hi>ſome Law firſt veſted in him,</hi> with <hi>Power</hi> to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to theſe Perſons, which He will willingly do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now this is Demonſtration: if the Law be the Meaſure of the King's Power, then he has no Power beyond the Bounds of the Law; and whatſoever is pretended in the King's Name beyond thoſe Bounds, is void, and carries no manner of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with it. Whereas to ſay, the King's Power is abſolute and boundleſs, is to ſay, the Government is abſolute and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and requires abſolute and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Subjection. For it is Nonſence to ſay, that boundleſs Power can be <hi>limited in the Exerciſe of it</hi>; for boundleſs Power, which has in it the whole Legiſlative Power, can at pleaſure make a Law to take away that Limitation; and he that is limited only by his own pleaſure, is not limited at all. And again, that is not Power, which cannot be exerciſed;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 110.</note> and therefore a Fountain full of boundleſs Power, which cannot be brought into Act, is a Fountain full of inauthoritative Authority, or full of Emptifulneſs.</p>
               <p>So much for our Author's Fountain, Pipes, and Channels. We have his other Illuſtration of a boundleſs limited Power
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66311:106"/>
in theſe Words:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 111.</note>
                  <q>To be confined in the Exerciſe, doth not deſtroy the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor diminiſh the Perfection of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power; for then the Power of God himſelf could not be Sovereign, becauſe there are certain immutable Rules of Truth and Juſtice, within which it is neceſſarily limited and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</q>
I anſwer; As God exerciſes no Power which is inconſiſtent with Truth and Juſtice, ſo he has no ſuch Power in him in the Root or Being, for it is all Imperfection and Weakneſs: And that he neither exerciſes, nor has any ſuch Power, is not to be imputed to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal Limitation or Confinement, but to the infinite and illimited Perfection of his Nature. And if ſuch a miſcalled Power, or Poſſibility of doing wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be found in the Creature, it is becauſe he is a Creature, it proceeds from Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs and Defect.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew our Author, how much more Light there is in a few plain Words, than in his Similitudes and Illuſtrations; I ſay, It is ſelf-evident, that a Man has no more Power in any kind than he can exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: A Man has no more natural Power, than he can naturally exerciſe; he has no more moral Power, than he can morally
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66311:106"/>
exerciſe; he has no more Civil or Legal Power, than he can legally exerciſe: For to ſay he has more Power than he can exerciſe, is to ſay, he can do more than he can do. And therefore an Ocean of our Author's boundleſs lawful Power of doing what cannot lawfully be done, will not fill an Egg-ſhell, and is ſuch a New-nothing, as even Children will deſpiſe.</p>
               <p>Before I paſs from this Diſtinction of Imperial and Political Laws, I muſt ſay ſomewhat to a Heap of Authorities, which we have, <hi>p.</hi> 208, 209. to prove that the Realm of <hi>England</hi> is an Empire, that the Crown of it is an <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> and that one of the Saxon Kings ſtiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Baſileus, Imperator, &amp; Dominus.</hi> Well, what of all that? The Realm of <hi>England</hi> is an Empire, has an Imperial Crown, and is as independent upon any Foreign Realm, as the Empire of <hi>Turkie</hi>; therefore the Freemen of <hi>England</hi> are as very Slaves as any are in <hi>Turky,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Imperial or Bowſtring Law.

Now the following Words are theſe: <q>To any Man's Laws, but ſuch as have been deviſed, made and ordained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realm, for the Wealth of the ſame, or to ſuch other, as by Sufferance of your Grace, and your Progenitors, the People of this your Realm have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at their free Liberty, by their own Conſent, to be uſed amongſt them, and have bound themſelves by long Uſe and Cuſtom to the Obſervance of the ſame; not as to the Obſervance of the Laws of any Foreign Prince, Potentate, or Prelate, but as to the Cuſtom and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Laws of this Realm, originally eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd as Laws of the ſame, by the ſaid Sufferance, Conſents, and Cuſtom, and none otherwiſe.

               </p>
               <p>Now our Author, it is poſſible, may find out of theſe Words an unalterable humane Law of Succeſſion, or that the King has the whole Legiſlative Power, or that there are Imperial Laws ordained within this Realm, which are not for the Wealth of the ſame, but may deſtroy the Political Laws at every turn: And ſo may any Body elſe make the ſame Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, who is reſolved before-hand to do it.</p>

Shew me That in any authentick Book of Common-Law, in any Statute, or in any Reſolution of all the Judges in <hi>England,</hi> and I will be as paſſive as any Man.</p>
               <p>Before I go any further, I muſt not forget a Paſſage which does more nearly concern me, <hi>p.</hi> 221, 222. wherein I am
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66311:110"/>
taxed for going contrary to my Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Acknowledgment, ordered by the Act of Uniformity: <hi>Wherein I have abhorred that Traitorous Poſition, of taking Arms by the King's Authority against his Perſon, or thoſe that are commiſſionated by him.</hi> Upon which he adds: <hi>It was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently the Deſign of the Three Eſtates in this Act, to ſecure the Nation of ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as would preach up the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance without diſtinction.</hi> But if it were, they are very much diſappointed; for our Author himſelf, who is as good at Indiſtinction and Confuſion in other Matters as any Man, does not preach the Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, but handles it with the Subtilty of a Schoolman. For he grants, <hi>p.</hi> 280, that one who is ſent by the King's Order to aſſaſſinate or deſtroy his Subjects, is not commiſſionated by the King, for he may be reſiſted by the King's Law, which is his moſt authoritative Command: But great Numbers or Forces ſo employed, may not be reſiſted. So that his Doctrine is this: That if twenty Men come, one by one, with the King's Order to do an illegal and deſtructive Act, they are not commiſſionated, and may be reſiſted; but if the ſame Number come together,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66311:110"/>
Rank and File, with the ſame Order, and upon the ſame Errand, then they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated, and may not be reſiſted. Is this preaching up the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance without diſtinction? Or rather, is it not making a ſilly Diſtinction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a difference? Again, in the ſame place he has Diſtinction upon Diſtinction, in theſe Words: <hi>The Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience allows a Man to reſiſt, or uſe the Sword to defend his Life, when the Laws [from which I except all Laws deſtructive of the King's Crown and Regality] autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize him ſo to do.</hi> This is preaching up, and preaching down the ſame Doctrine in the ſame Breath, upon a wicked Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that the Laws of the Land, which protect the Subject, are deſtructive of the King's Crown and Regality. Now on the other hand, all faithful Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> preach Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Laws, and Non-reſiſtance of thoſe who are commiſſionated by the King, without diſtinction, and without deceiving the People to their Deſtruction, and telling them thoſe are commiſſionated by the King, whom the Law declares are not commiſſionated, nor <hi>can</hi> be commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated, as no Man can be to deſtroy law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects.</p>

                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:66311:111"/>Such illegal Commiſſions are declared by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to be null and void, and ſo we ought to account them, as you may ſee by the following Words:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.</note>
                  <q>And for this our Gift and Grant of theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and of others, contained in our Charter of Liberties of our Forreſt, the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Earls, Barons, Knights, Freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,<note place="margin">Toties emptae &amp; redemptae libertates.</note> and other our Subjects, have given unto us the fifteenth part of all their Moveables: And we have granted to them on the other part, that neither we, nor our Heirs, ſhall procure or do any thing, whereby the Liberties in this Charter contained, ſhall be infringed or broken.

So that what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of an Idol, may be fitly applied to a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contrary to Law: <hi>For we know that an</hi> illegal Commiſſion <hi>is nothing in the World.</hi> And accordingly we find in Acts of Grace, that Men who act upon ſuch Commiſſions, do ſtand in as much need of Pardon as other Men, and had the Benefit of the Act of Oblivion in the firſt place, as you may ſee by the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which are there pardoned. <q>Firſt,

               </p>
               <p>His fourth and laſt Principle, upon which he builds his falſe Paſſive Obedience, is a falſe Pretence of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign's Honour; concerning which he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 279. <hi>The Laws are more tender of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66311:112"/>
our Sovereign's Honour, as he is God's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, than of his Subjects Lives.</hi> As if the King's Honour, and his good Subjects Lives, could ever ſtand in ſuch a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Competition, that one of them muſt of neceſſity deſtroy the other; and as if the Laws of <hi>England</hi> had provided, that the Lives of the People of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be ſacrificed to the King's Honour. Has our Author been abroad to fetch home <hi>pour ma Gloire,</hi> and to render it into this Engliſh? He might have had ſounder and ſafer Notions at home, out of Judg <hi>Jenkins,</hi> whom he often quotes to no purpoſe. <hi>Pag.</hi> 134. we have theſe Words: <q>The Gentleman ſays, <hi>We do not ſwear,</hi> (meaning in the Oath of Supremacy) <hi>that the King is above all Law, nor above the Safety of his People.</hi> Neither do we ſo ſwear (ſays Judg <hi>Jenkins</hi>) but his Majeſty and we will ſwear to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,<note place="margin">Judg <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> Works, <hi>p.</hi> 134.</note> and have ſworn, and have made good, and will by God's Grace make good our Oath to the World, that the KING is not above the Law, nor above the Safety of his People: The Law, and the Safety of the People, are his <hi>Safety,</hi> his <hi>Honour,</hi> and his Strength.</q>
And accordingly it has been always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in Parliament, to be the Honour
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:66311:112"/>
and Glory of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> that they were Kings of Freemen, and not of Slaves; whereby they have been ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to do greater Things, and to make a larger Figure in the World, than Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of five times their Territories. But this Author has pick'd up quite contrary Notions, and thinks it a Diſhonour to the King, if the generous People which he governs, be not Slaves to every Parcel of Criminals, who, <hi>againſt the King's Crown and Dignity,</hi> ſhall wickedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them in his Name.</p>
               <p>I have now done with every Thing that looks like an Argument in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Paſſive Obedience; for as for the following Chapter, there is nothing new in it; he only chews the Cud upon his Notions of Sovereignty, and rings Changes upon his Imperial and Political Laws. And then in the 12<hi>th</hi> Chapter, after he has bound us hand and foot, and prepared us for the Popiſh Knife, he has the Face to tell us, That notwithſtanding this Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance, or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience, we ſhall be ſecure enough of our Lives, Properties, and Religion under a Popiſh Succeſſor. For after he has given us the <hi>Security of God's Care
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66311:113"/>
and Providence,</hi> which we always forfeit, unleſs we take care of our ſelves; and the <hi>Security of a Popiſh Prince's Conſcience,</hi> againſt which we deſire Counter-Security; and the <hi>Security of a Popiſh Prince's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> which is to be Sainted for extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the peſtilent Northern Hereſy, and for driving all Proteſtants and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion out of the World; and the <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Political Laws,</hi> which he has proved to be Bankrupt, and not half ſo good Security as a Broom-ſtaff. In the laſt place, to our unſpeakable Comfort, he tells us that the Imperial Laws cannot be put in Execution: <hi>For in ſuch a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, all good Men would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the Service of the King, and the Bad durſt not ſerve him.</hi> So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Author, a Popiſh Prince will be left to do his Work all alone; for no Popiſh Cut-Throats, no Iriſh Ruffians, no Forces can be had, for Love or Money.</p>
               <p>Now People may take this Security which our Author offers them, if they pleaſe; they may have their Throats cut with a Feather, if they have a mind to it: But for my part, I muſt acknowledg my own Infirmity, I cannot ſwallow ſuch groſs Shams, I cannot believe incredible
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66311:113"/>
Things, upon any Man's Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, not tho he deliver them with all the ſeeming Gravity and Seriouſneſs, as if he were ſaving a Soul.</p>
               <p>To our Author's Concluſion in praiſe of a Martyrdom, I have only this to ſay, That there is a Time for all Things; and God be thanked, that that Diſcourſe is very impertinent. As it would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd us, ſo it would have edified us more, if <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all the Laws which eſtabliſh the Proteſtant Religion, had been repealed; but for all that, I hope they will ſtand, when he, and his Invention of Imperial Laws are forgotten. The Diſcourſe is a good Diſcourſe, but methinks it would have look'd more in earneſt, if it had been dated, as the laſt Page of it was, <hi>E Carcere:</hi> for, conſidering all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I am no otherwiſe affected with it, than I was with the precious Paſſive Doctrine, and the <hi>good Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our good Church,</hi> in <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for diſſolving the Parliament. If by the Providence of God, in ſome ſuch Calamity as a caſual Fire, I fall into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and a Fellow-Sufferer with me bids me poſſeſs my Soul in Patience, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66311:114"/>
me with Conſiderations proper for ſuch a Condition, telling me, that our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf had not where to lay his Head; and that the Apoſtles, of whom the World was not worthy, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs had no certain Dwelling-Place in it, and yet were contented in that low Condition; I ſhall look upon him as an Angel from Heaven. But if a Company of us be travelling near <hi>Shooters-Hill,</hi> with all that we have in the World, and the whole Subſiſtence of our ſelves and Families, about us; and a Gentleman well mounted and accoutred, ſhall come and preach up to us the Advantages of Poverty at a ſtrange rate, telling us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that by our Saviour's Precept, and the Apoſtles Example, we ought not to carry Money in our Scrips; and that in caſe we be ſet upon, to be rifled of all we have, we are by no means to defend our ſelves, but, like the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whom the Apoſtle commends, to take joyfully the ſpoiling of our Goods: I believe this kind of Diſcourſe would look very ſuſpiciouſly to all of us, and (God forgive me for it if I wronged him) I ſhould hardly take him for a True-man, but for the Confederate of ſome miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Gang hard by, who, as a famous
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:66311:114"/>
Captain of them heretofore uſed to ſay, <hi>would eaſe us of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchristian Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and ſend us lighter to Heaven.</hi> And I ſhould think not one Jot the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him, but much the worſe, for his abounding with Scripture, and applying it in that manner.</p>
               <p>Having in the beginning of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe made mention of our Author's Cavils, which he has raiſed againſt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, I ſhall here give the Reader a Taſte of them. Our Author may call them my whole Store, as he ſpeaks, <hi>p.</hi> 109. with which Paſſage I ſhall begin; and in Anſwer to a Heap of Falſifications, I ſhall tell him the very Words of <hi>Juventinus</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> to which I referr'd, and which they ſpoke publickly, and for which they were accuſed, and which <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> calls admirable Expreſſions: <hi>For thou haſt delivered us,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Emperor, ſuch an Apoſtate as is not again upon the Face of the Earth,</hi> cap. 14. but three or four Lines before what he himſelf quotes out of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to ſham us; which too much diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Man. As for the Souldiers, who were trepann'd into Sacrificing, of whom I ſaid, that they did not ſpare <hi>Julian</hi> in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:66311:115"/>
the leaſt, of whom our Author diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>p.</hi> 111, <hi>&amp;c. Theodoret</hi> ſays this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, <hi>They went to Court with their Outcries, exclaiming againſt the Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles and Fallacies of the Tyrant, inſomuch,</hi> as the Hiſtorian adds, <hi>that they made</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian <hi>mad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe theſe Souldiers did not <hi>form themſelves into a Posture of Defence against ſuch a lawleſs Tyrant as</hi> Julian, our Author threatens, <hi>p.</hi> 114. that <hi>they, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with</hi> Juventinus <hi>and</hi> Maximus, <hi>ſhall be the Thundring Legion for the time to come</hi>; and the <hi>musty Thebaean Legion,</hi> as he calls it, ſhall be laid aſide, and give place to this. Now ſuppoſe theſe Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had been a Legion compleat, into what Poſture of Reſiſtance could they have formed themſelves, to have beaten eleven Legions? for a Roman Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of twelve. But this terrible Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherewith we are menaced, which, becauſe it did not confound <hi>Julian,</hi> muſt ruine us, conſiſts of a dozen or fourteen Men at the moſt, (for they all roſe up from one Table) and together with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventinus</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> are ſixteen Men effective; ſo that we have juſt 6650 Faggots. For Fallacies, and for falſe Muſters, I never yet knew our Author's Match.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:66311:115"/>It would be tedious to ſhew, how he ſhuffles with the Stories of <hi>Maris</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the Nobleman of <hi>Berea,</hi> and <hi>Publia,</hi> which cannot be parallel'd in any other Age, (for <hi>Julian</hi>'s Reign, tho very ſhort, and yet much too long, did happen in a certain Age of the World). The firſt of theſe made a hard ſhift to go to Court, on purpoſe to tell <hi>Julian</hi> his own very publickly, whither, I am well aſſured, ſome other Men would have gone crouching with their baiſe Mains. The other, beſides diſinheriting his Son for turning to the Emperor's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, told the Emperor to his Face, that his Son was a Villain, and hated of God for it, and had embraced a Lie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the true Religion. So that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> might well complain to his deareſt Brother <hi>Libanius,</hi> of his ill Uſage at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raea,</hi> which cut him to the Heart,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Julian.</hi> Ep. 27. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> as you may ſee in his Letter to <hi>Libanius</hi>; where he ſays, that he had ſome Talk with the Senate about Religion, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for they behaved themſelves impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently towards him; and wonders, by the Gods, that ſome Men ſhould be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Vertue, and others again ſhould pride themſelves in Sacrilege and Sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:66311:116"/>And then as for <hi>Publia</hi>'s counting <hi>Julian</hi> fit to be deſpiſed and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and picking out proper Pſalms for him, and watching for Opportunities of beſtowing her Bleſſings upon him, it cannot be match'd by all Antiquity. For I do not wonder, that in the midſt of Agonies, or upon the ſight of a Martyr's being put to death, the Zeal of ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chriſtians did break forth into ſuch like Expreſſions: But all theſe that I ſpeak of, were in cold Blood; and <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was ſo far from provoking them, that they were fain to whet their own Zeal themſelves.</p>
               <p>According to our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 127. the Pſalms of the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> at which <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was ſo enraged as he never was in his Life, and could not contain himſelf, did only wiſh <hi>Julian</hi> what they themſelves counted the greateſt Happineſs in the World, namely his Converſion to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and that to be wrought by no harſher Penance than a Deboiſt, which every Freſh-man at <hi>Cambridg</hi> has often undergone, upon much ſmaller Accounts, and which, the Learned ſay, comes from our Author's Hebrew Word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But I muſt crave leave to inform our Author, that the Word <hi>confounded,</hi> (and ſo the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66311:116"/>
Word <hi>aſhamed</hi>) in <hi>David,</hi> ſignifies much more than being put to the Bluſh; for it implies ſome very great Evil, ſome aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Calamity, and terrible Rebuke. And therefore theſe Words are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put together, <hi>Let them be confounded and periſh.</hi> Pſal. 71.11. Confuſion is oppoſed to Deliverance and Safety; and, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53.6. which is the mildeſt Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Word, <hi>Thou hast put them to Confuſion,</hi> is as much as, <hi>Thou haſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their Bones.</hi> But it may be our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, when he ſays the laſt Verſe of <hi>Te Deum,</hi> which is taken from the firſt Verſe of the 25 or 71 Pſalm, <hi>O Lord, in thee have I trusted, let me never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded</hi>; prays only that he may never bluſh: which I am apt to think, or elſe we had had none of this Stuff.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>p.</hi> 139. the joint and publick Prayers, the Common-Prayer of a whole City, in their Cathedral Church, for <hi>Julian</hi>'s Deſtruction, muſt not be called <hi>their</hi> Prayers. That's hard! when old <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf, being a Biſhop, might write <hi>We,</hi> and yet <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and Words of Multitude muſt not be called <hi>They.</hi> Further, if the Practice of the pureſt Church in that Age, a Church that was called the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Orat.</hi> 19. <hi>p.</hi> 297.</note>

Ark in thoſe Days,</hi> and which <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſays, was like <hi>Bethlehem, the Metropolis of all the World,</hi> muſt not paſs for the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church; then there is no ſuch thing in Antiquity as the Practice of the Church, and it is in vain to talk of it.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Page, our Author put me in great hopes, that he would ſhew me a Prayer for <hi>Julian</hi>'s Converſion, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>he could produce one Example,</hi> and by upbraiding my <hi>wilful Blindneſs</hi> in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch a Barn-Door, when I was ſo near it; but I was grievouſly diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when I found that this Example was <hi>Sozomen</hi>'s Account of <hi>Dydimus</hi> his Prayer and Faſting: For there is not one Word or Syllable in <hi>Sozomen,</hi> of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or Repentance; neither do I know by what Authority he forges and foiſts Words into Authors at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But on the other hand, the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Anſwer of <hi>Dydimus</hi>'s Prayer is a ſtrong Proof that he prayed for <hi>Julian</hi>'s Deſtruction: For it was at that time, in a very wonderful manner revealed to him, that <hi>Julian</hi> was that day killed, and he was bid to tell the News to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> the Biſhop, who, I ſuppoſe, was another that contributed to <hi>Julian's</hi> Deſtruction, as well as the two <hi>Gregories,</hi> and the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66311:117"/>
Church of <hi>Nazianzum</hi>; and as the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian adds, immediatly upon this <hi>he fell to eating,</hi> as if his Faſting had now attained its End. And further, the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of that Chapter in <hi>Sozomen</hi> is to ſhew,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sozom.</hi> lib. 6. cap. 2.</note> that <hi>Julian</hi>'s Death and Deſtruction was from God, becauſe he laid waſte his Churches. Upon which account the Prophets and Apoſtles entred into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation againſt him, as you have it in the firſt Viſion of that Chapter; and two of their Number going out in all haſte, as it ſhould ſeem, to diſpatch him, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the next Night to the Aſſembly, with an Account of his Death. And I had not Room in a little Book for all thoſe Stories, or elſe the Reader ſhould have had them.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Valentinian,</hi> our Author ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 116. <hi>That if he had ſhaked the Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter off his Cloaths, it had been all one, and he had thereby owned his Religion, as well as by ſtriking the Priest.</hi> Now <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the Confeſſor not only ſhook the Holy-Water off but tore off that part of his Cloaths upon which the Holy-Water fell, and ſaid he was polluted by it: And yet that did not ſerve his Turn, but he ſtruck the Prieſt too before <hi>Julian's</hi> Face, which <hi>Julian</hi> reſented as a high Contempt, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:66311:118"/>
puniſhed him thereafter. And it lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Author to prove, that ever <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> excuſed himſelf, and begg'd the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Pardon.</p>
               <p>The next thing, in the ſame Page, is the Inſtance which I gave of old <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Behaviour, againſt which our Author raiſes ſuch a Multitude of little Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as will not all of them amount to one real Objection. However, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them I ſay, that <hi>He,</hi> the Perſon in Controverſy, is <hi>Julian:</hi> For beſides that <hi>Elias Cretenſis</hi> renders <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſignify to be beaten on the Feet, or drubb'd, inſtead of kickt, I ſhall not contend; provided he will firſt agree the Matter with <hi>Billius,</hi> who renders it <hi>calcibus caeſus,</hi> and with the only <hi>Elias Cretenſis</hi> we have, who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it <hi>pedibus contuſus,</hi> to whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I purpoſely and expreſly referred my ſelf, knowing I had to do with captious Perſons; and provided he will let the Engliſh Word, <hi>kick'd,</hi> ſerve to expreſs a contemptuous Beating, becauſe in this Country, the way of ſetting a Man upon his Head, and beating the Soles of his Feet, is not ſo well underſtood. And as upon theſe Conditions I will not fall out with him upon this one Criticiſm, ſo he has Reaſon to take this Conceſſion kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for I do aſſure him, that I will not make him ſuch another again, nor bate him one Syllable in my whole Book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. Laſtly, as for the <hi>

               <p>In the ſame Chapter, <hi>p.</hi> 122. he finds a Plot againſt the Chaplains, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in rendring <gap reason="foreign">

There is likewiſe in the ſame Chapter, <hi>p.</hi> 124. ſomewhat that is like the Letter from <hi>Legorn,</hi> from on board the <hi>Van-Herring</hi>; but that being a myſterious ſort of Writing, is out of my way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall ſay nothing at all to it.</p>
               <p>Our Author's frequent Inconſiſtencies and Contradictions would fill a Book. The Roman Empire, he ſays, was Elective, and yet, <hi>p.</hi> 9. in the fundamental Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it, <hi>it was decreed by the Senate to</hi> Julius Caeſar, <hi>and the Sons of his Body. P.</hi> 222. He calls this an Atheiſtical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>That all Power is radically in the People</hi>; And yet it ſeems it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:66311:119"/>
at <hi>Sparta</hi>; for, <hi>p.</hi> 240, he tells us, <hi>The Kings of</hi> Sparta <hi>had only the Exerciſe of the Sovereign Power, but not the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power it ſelf; that was radically and originally in the People:</hi> And ſo in the ſame Page, <hi>The Magiſtrates in</hi> Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>derive their Power from the People.</hi> Now I thought, that what was really Atheiſm in one Country, would never prove to be good Divinity in another, but muſt be Atheiſm every where.</p>
               <p>But becauſe our Author is pleaſed to call this an <hi>Atheiſtical as well as an Illegal Principle</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; I ſhall here ſet down the Words of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> as great a Man, perhaps, as ever <hi>England</hi> bred; whoſe Book has been deſervedly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by ſeveral Kings, and admired by all Men, and who does not uſe to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with broaching Atheiſtical and Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Principles. <hi>Eccleſ. Pol. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <q>All Publick Regiment, of what kind ſoever, ſeemeth evidently to have riſen from deliberate Advice, Conſultation, and Compoſition between Men.</q>
And after a large Diſcourſe to that purpoſe, he has theſe Words: <q>That which we ſpake before concerning the Power of Government, muſt here be applied to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:66311:120"/>
the Power of making Laws whereby to govern; which Power God hath over all; and by the Natural Law whereunto he hath made all Subject, the lawful Power of making Laws to command whole Politick Societies of Men, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſo properly unto the ſame entire Societies, that for any Prince or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, of what kind ſoever, upon Earth, to exerciſe the ſame of himſelf, and not either by expreſs Commiſſion, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and <hi>perſonally</hi> received from God, or elſe by Authority derived at firſt from their Conſent, upon whoſe Perſons they impoſe Laws, it is no better than meer Tyranny.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is wonderful to ſee what a Duſt he raiſes about the Purſuivant, <hi>p.</hi> 276, 277, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which yet may be all layed by one Word, and by only ſaying, That <hi>Brownlow</hi>'s Reports were writ for thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Word <hi>Homicide,</hi> which amongſt other things is Chance-medley, or <hi>Se De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendendo,</hi> as well as <hi>Man-Slaughter.</hi> And in this very Caſe, <hi>Simpſon</hi>'s Caſe, which you have over again in <hi>Coke</hi>'s 4<hi>th</hi> part <hi>Inſt. of Eccleſ. Courts,</hi> p. 333. with more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Circumſtances; my Lord Chief-Juſtice <hi>Coke</hi> ſays expreſly, it was <hi>Se defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:66311:120"/>
in <hi>Simpſon.</hi> And yet how many Reflections does our Author load me with, upon occaſion of that ignorant Miſtake, juſt as he has done in many other places of his Book! But it would be hard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if one Man's Honeſty and Integrity were to be all forfeited by another Man's Ignorance. There is, I confeſs, in that large abuſive Diſcourſe, one material Queſtion, which he puts to me in theſe Words: <hi>Will he make the Law the compleat and adequate Rule to walk by?</hi> Which I ſhould anſwer my ſelf, but I will get Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Hall</hi> to do it better for me, in theſe Words: <q>What then if the Thief,<note place="margin">Reſolutions of Practical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Dec.</hi> 2. <hi>Caſe</hi> 1.</note> after his Robbery done, ceaſing any further Danger of Violence, ſhall betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Heels, and run away with my Money? In ſuch a Caſe, if the Sum be ſo conſiderable, as that it much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports my Eſtate, however our Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Laws may cenſure it, (with which,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dalton,</hi> p. 244.</note> of old, even a killing <hi>Se defendendo</hi> was no leſs than Felony of Death) my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhould not ſtrike me, if I purſue him with all my Might, and in hot Chaſe ſo ſtrike him, as that by this means I diſable him from a further Eſcape, for the recovery of my own; and if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66311:121"/>
his Death ſhall follow, however I ſhould paſs with Men, God and my own Heart would acquit me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, you ſee the Biſhop is ſo far of your Mind, that <hi>he does not think the Law a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and adequate Rule to walk by</hi>; for he would have exceeded and tranſgreſs'd the Law, in defence of his own Right; nay, he would not have thought himſelf hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by his Clerical Character, but with his own Epiſcopal Hand,<note place="margin">See the ſame Caſe, <hi>p.</hi> 100, 101.</note> whether the Law had given him leave or no, would have ſlain a Thief, running away with his Purſe. And yet <hi>Simpſon</hi> muſt make a narrow Eſcape, by Repentance and his Neck-Verſe, from Hell and the Gallows, for ſtrugling to reſcue himſelf from a Man-catcher, who was running away with his Perſon.</p>
               <p>Our Author's Law, and Caſuiſtical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity are ſo well match'd, that it is pity they ſhould ever be parted; of both which I ſhall take my leave at preſent, becauſe I intended a little Book, and not a <hi>Folio.</hi>
