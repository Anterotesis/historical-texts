            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>of Gods bleſsings are the arguments of his love:</hi> whence it is apparent that God did wonderfully declare his tender love to the Church upon earth, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually raiſing famous men, who like burning lights in golden Candleſtickes, did ſhine forth to the honour and glory of his Sanctuary. And as no age (ſince the Apoſtles time) hath been ſo glorious for the light of truth, and the abundance of lights as the preſent, ſo I hope (without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to any) our <hi>Brightman</hi> of bleſſed memory, for names ſake, may deſervedly finde a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe that were moſt famous in this kinde; for truely whilſt he lived he was, as Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Iohn Baptist, A burning and a ſhining light.</hi> He was<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 33</note> famous in Preaching, and for his converſation making himſelf an example to the Church, by practiſing what he Preached, living according to the rule of his Doctrine. Yea and that which is wonderfull, this light of ours being extinct,

            </p>
            <p>The manner of his handling this Scripture, eſpecially in the application, is univerſall; for he held this prophecie to be wonderfully difficult, whence it is no marvell, if ſome doubt whether he did attain to the genuine interpretation of the Song: but ſince the diffiulty of the Allegory hath occaſioned ſuch variance amongſt the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that it may almoſt be ſaid; as many men, ſo many mindes: I hope it will not be diſtaſtefull to the Church of Chriſt, that the labours of this her godly ſonne are publiſhed in Print, whereby the Reader may perceive the Authors great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in this myſterie: hee doth acknowledge a marriage beween Chriſt and his Church; but in this he differs from the reſt of the Interpreters, that what they conclude to be always, he reſtrains to certain times. I confeſſe, he that for ſakes the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient opinions of learned and godly men, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to himſelf a new way, in which he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all alone, may (in good manners) be thought to erre; but becauſe ſometimes he that readeth underſtandeth that, which the Prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves which Propheſied it did not know, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

            <p>Reader, I thought good to premiſe theſe things for thy ſake, and for the Authors praiſe; (at which I chiefly aim) much more might be ſpoken, but read the Author, who in the Explication of the firſt verſe, doth by way of Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THis Propheſie following agreeth well neere in all things with that of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> They fore-ſhew the ſame events in the like times. And either of them directeth his courſe to the ſame marke. They differ ſo much in beginnings as <hi>Salomon</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>John</hi> in age. They alſo follow ſomewhat, a divers manner of handling it. <hi>John</hi> ſetteth forth the ſtrifes and battells of the Church more at large, and exactly painteth out her enemies with a greater caution or heed taking. But this Propheticall Paranymph (or marriage maker) toucheth theſe things more ſparingly, deſirous onely to ſet forth the joyfull events of the Church, he ſcarcely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth at all any accidents, whereby this nuptiall ſong might be diſturbed: or at leaſt ſo ſeaſoning her troubles, that much pleaſure may alwayes appeare in them.</p>
                     <p>But firſt let us weigh the words, then let us ſee the Application: Kiſſes are ſometimes taken for ſaire, milde, and pleaſant words, as chidings and brawlings are compared to wounds, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 6. <hi>The wounds of a lover are more faithfull then the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring kiſſes of an enemie.</hi> The Church then deſireth to be inſtructed
<pb n="982" facs="tcp:100380:7"/>
with the words of her Bridegroome, which ſhe calleth Kiſſes, as the moſt aſſured pledges of the Bridegroomes love; neither can any thing be compared with this love; therefore ſhe preferreth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wine, which is chiefely eſteemed among thoſe things which taſte moſt pleaſantly: for the compariſons of this ſong are taken from ſuch things which do chiefely tickle up the ſences: becauſe our infirmity is ſuch, that we commonly feele no greater pleaſure in this life, then in thoſe things which pertaine to theſe inferior ſences. This is the ſum: the company of the faithfull doe chiefely deſire to be altogether over-whelmed in a moſt familiar converſation with Chriſt, and to be moſt plentifully inſtructed with the words of his mouth: which they confirme to be the great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſt pleaſure that can be. Now for the Application. <hi>Solomon</hi> beginneth from the Church of his time, and ſheweth the face of it as it was in the Raigne of his Father <hi>David,</hi> in this and the next verſe. Chriſt then by the mouth of <hi>David</hi> (bearing his Type) kiſſed the Church, inſtructing it with moſt ſweete <hi>Odes, Pſalmes</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> wherein that time was moſt excellent above all others. <hi>David</hi> is called the ſweete ſinger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the Teſtimony of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 1. Whereof the booke of <hi>Pſalmes</hi> is a plentifull witneſſe. <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed 1005. ſongs, but very few of them are recorded in the Sacred Treaſury.</p>
                     <p>The Prophets, which were many then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at other times, did chide very often; but not kiſſe: They reproved ſins, they thundred out Judgements, they terrified with threatnings: whereas this ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> powred out almoſt nothing but prayers, thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, promiſes and Exhortations: worthily were theſe the times of kiſſing and imbracing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chiefly, if ye adde all that care and diligence, which hee applied to ordaine the worſhip of God moſt fitly, 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. &amp;c.

                     <p>Firſt, the King drawing by his example, and the ſpirit working to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the faithfull. The firſt authority of his raigne began with the publiſhed meeting at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 1. 2. Of what force was this attraction? There followed moſt calme peace, ſuch abundance of wealth as no where the like: wiſedome almoſt more then mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Glory which amazed all other Kings: and (which exceeded all) a beholding next unto God. Theſe were enough to have drawn the moſt unwilling. But the people followed willingly: <hi>We will run</hi> (ſay they) <hi>after thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly here is taught, that the people drawn by the Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, do flie with a ſwift courſe: He commanded the meeting at <hi>Gibeon:</hi> they flocked thither in great troopes, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the chamber, whereinto the Bride is brought: was that moſt magnificent Temple built by <hi>Solomon.</hi> This houſe is the inner chamber; nay rather the couch and Bed (as it is afterward called) wherein the Bridegroom converſeth with the Bride moſt familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: whither <hi>Solomon</hi> brought the Church, when for her ſake he built and adorned it ſo beautifully; and eſpecially by drawing the people into the Temple, on the day wherein he dedicated the houſe, going before them with ſacrifices, prayer and thankſgiving, as 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 8. through the whole chapter.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and fiftly is declared, how joyfull all the people were of thoſe things, ſo happily begun and continued for many yeers.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly he ſaith, <hi>the upright love thee.</hi> But why doth he mention the upright, as though there were any in thoſe times whoſe hearts were not ſincere and ſound? verily he ſeemeth by theſe words to paſſe over privily thoſe bleſſed times to a ſorrowfull falling away. We know how grievouſly <hi>Solomon</hi> fell in the laſt yeers of his reigne, by bringing in ſtrange wives, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 11. His heart was not found towards the Lord, but he followed <hi>Aſhtaroth</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the faithfull and upright in heart, remained firm in the truth, howſoever deſtitute of the Kings authority.

Now in this whole preparation, King <hi>Cyrus</hi> repreſenteth the perſon of her beloved, whom God had ſtirred up to deliver the Church: Then after a long time, was the voyce of the beloved firſt heard, when the rumor began to be ſpred abroad, that the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> would make war againſt <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Prophets noted out <hi>Cyrus</hi> by name, many yeers before; that when they ſhould heare him preparing for war, they might not doubt, but it was the voyce it ſelf of the beloved, <hi>Iſay</hi> 44. 28. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>He is my Shepheard, and ſhall performe all my pleaſure:</hi> and 45. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, to his anoynted</hi> Cyrus, <hi>whoſe right hand</hi> I <hi>have holden to ſubdue nations, &amp;c. that thou mayeſt know, that</hi> I <hi>the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which call thee by thy name, am the God of</hi> Iſrael.

Now for the ſwiftneſſe of his comming it is ſaid, <hi>Hee came leaping,</hi> as it were, haſtning over the Mountains on ſtilts, ſo paſſing over the little hils, that hee did not at all touch them. In this manner was the comming of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſwift and ſudden.

The Church therefore complaineth it was ſuch a time, wherein true Religion was trodden down, ſo that Chriſt whom the faithfull thirſted for, was no where to be found in his true worſhip. Theſe things then belong to that deſolation which <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> brought upon them, who robbed the Temple, forbad Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, offered Swines fleſh in the Temple, conſtrained them to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſtrange gods, compelled them to leave circumciſing their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, burned their holy Bookes, and left no manner of wickedneſſe unattempted. This wofull ſpectacle <hi>Daniel</hi> did manifeſtly declare almoſt 300. yeeres before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 9, 10, &amp;c. and 11. 28, 29, &amp;c.

Here the guard is deſcribed, to whom the watch and'a cuſtody of this bed is committed. Their number and nature was expreſſed in the former verſe. Now their readineſſe, skill and diligence is ſhewed, together with the end of their watching in theſe words. Firſt, they are called ſword-men, ready and ſtrong-men, whoſe vertue feareth no danger. Secondly, they are expert in war; that is to ſay, old, hardy, skilfull ſouldiers: <hi>every one</hi> hath his ſword. Beds are appointed for reſt and ſleep, whereby a man for the time is deprived of his ſtrength, and all power to defend himſelf; wherefore Kings and Princes, (to ſleep the more ſafely) ordained watch-men, ſuch as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> is here ſaid to have had. Which teacheth, that this beloved, all the time that he gave himſelf to reſt, was fenced with ſuch a guard, as could keep him ſafe from all feare in the night; that is, from all ſecret deceipts which the wicked could invent. This time of reſt, was the whole infancie of Chriſt, which maketh a man no leſſe able to avoyd dangers then the deepeſt ſleep that is. <hi>Herod</hi> making uſe of this night, endeavoured (moſt wickedly) his deſtruction: But the Angel <hi>(one of the mighties of</hi> Iſrael) warning <hi>Joſeph</hi> to flie with the childe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> delivered him from the jawes of <hi>Herod,</hi> and the cruell ſlaughter of the <hi>Bethlehemites.</hi> Truly this bed was better guarded then <hi>Salomons.</hi>

Wherefore that of Chriſt remaineth without doubt, in the ſame meaning as the words do properly ſhew: <hi>The Angells themſelves know not the very</hi> laſt day.

            <p>The ſecond and third after the Dragon are two beaſts, the firſt out of the Sea, the ſecond out of the earth.</p>

            <p>He is likewiſe called the Beaſt which was and is not, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 11. by which is meant the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, in the Weſt, which lay voide three hundred twenty five yeeres, from <hi>Auguſtulus,</hi> to <hi>Carolus Magnus.</hi>

            <p>In the thirteenth chapter it is ſaid that the firſt beaſt is wounded and healed by a Dragon, before the ariſing of the ſecond Beaſt; which Dragon ſome ſay was <hi>Athaulphus</hi> that wounded <hi>Honorius</hi> the Emperour, Ann. 414. Others ſay <hi>Odoacer,</hi> who overthrew <hi>Auguſtulus</hi> the laſt Romane <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Another (viz.

            <p>So from <hi>Auguſtulus</hi> to <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> the Empire was void, 325. yeers, wherein ſaith <hi>Eraeſmus, Antichriſt</hi> was to ariſe. <hi>Downam, Napier and Brightman,</hi> ſay he roſe when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> removed the Empire (out of the way) to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> It is true, then the whore conceived the monſter, but ſhe bore him in her womb 35. yeers, before ſhe brought him forth to the fight of the world, 2.

            <p>He that withheld was taken away by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> (311) when he overthrew <hi>Diocleſian, Maxentius, and Maximinian</hi> the laſt of thoſe Dragons: neither is he there ſaid preſently to appear or be borne into the world, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 11. <hi>and</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Beaſt after his riſing, cauſeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worſhip the firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed. Theſe were the Emperours: as <hi>Phocus,</hi> who gave the firſt title
