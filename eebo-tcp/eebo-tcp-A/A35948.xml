            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <label>Complaint.</label>
O How dolefully different is this day from this day ſevennight? when Parliament, and Councel oſ State, Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council of the City of <hi>London,</hi> with the Officers of the Army, met at their ſacred Solemn devotions of ſinging, praying, prayſing and preaching the praiſes of God, for the late deliverance from the Northweſt Inſurrection; marching afterwards in great State with ſound of Trumpets, atrendance of Armed Souldiers, and aſpect of innumerable people, to a moſt ſumptious Dinner, where they eat and drank of all choiſe varieties and rarities, with great welcome, and rare Muſick, and all interchangeable ſigns and ſignifications, of integrated unity and amity. <hi>But now</hi> the Army hath (they ſay) <hi>diſſolved</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>And</hi> is not this daies ſorrow far greater then that daies joy; ſad enough to break more hearts then on that day were made merry?</p>
            <p>
               <label>Query.</label> Say ye the Parliament is <hi>diſſolved,</hi> How can that be, when by an Act of the people in Parliament, this Parliament was never to be diſſolved, without an Act of their own. Nor did thoſe Repreſentatives of the the people of <hi>England</hi> ever conſent to their diſſolution? So that let come never ſo many pretended Parliaments, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, Forms pretending Supream Power; yet will not the ſupremacy of this Parl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſtill impend over them? Will not the Authority of this Parliament be ſtill in force, to call all the ſaid Pretentioners to an accompt, and to ſtick in their ſides, when ever the free people of <hi>England,</hi> (continually watching their opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys) ſhall bring them back to ſit in Parliament?</p>
            <p>
               <label>Compl.</label> However, if the Army have not <hi>diſſolved,</hi> yet ſure enough they have <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,</hi> and put off the Parliament; which is ſad enough. It being all one with <hi>not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a remedy,</hi> as not to have <hi>Liberty to uſe it:</hi> So that the cry of the good people is; The Parliament is gone, and we in probability for ever undone.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Quaere.</label> Whether we ſhall do well, ſo to conclude? For did they not ſo once afore, in <hi>Olivers</hi> time; ſome of them aſſiſting him in that evil, others of the Army afterwards, ſtrengthning him keeping out the Parliament till many of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſome of the Souldiers troubled in Conſcience left the Army; and others ſo manifeſted their disſatisfaction, that they were lifted out by <hi>Oliver?</hi> And is not this laſt evil in this ſecond interruption greater then the former? And therefore like to cry lowder againſt their Conſciences, to cauſe them (if God pleaſe) to return? I ſay, I Query whether this ſecond interruption be not greater then the former, all things conſidered? For, did not the remaining Officets of the Army (pretending to godlineſs) refuſe to take warning of treaſuring up an evil Conſcience, by the trouble of Conſcience that befel the others? Did they not aſſiſt in the Proclaiming <hi>Richard</hi> Protector? not knowing any ſufficient ground? And had they not the patience, and connivance at leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not giving ſome aſſiſtance to the ſaid <hi>Richads</hi> callin a <hi>Free Pauliament</hi> (as they named it); ſo <hi>free,</hi> that beſides (through notorious patching and ſhuffling) the moſt of them were
<pb facs="tcp:50850:2"/>
Engliſh Cavelleers, arch Royaliſts; there were called in 60 <hi>Scottiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives; againſt all Law, Cuſtome, Ordinance or ſhew of Authority whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; to the dangerous prejudice of this Nation of <hi>England</hi> (they being a third part more then the <hi>Quorum</hi> of an Engliſh Parliament) able to make Lawes upon us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our conſents, if at any time 40 of ours ſhould not be in the Houſe?</p>
            <p>And moreover did not the complexion of that Parliament (as they call it) appear as looking towards a Kings At leaſt did not the Army ſuſpect ſo much, whereby they feared the reverting of Kings, Queens, Lands, and Fee-FarmRents? And did not the Officers of the Army upon theſe and the like conſiderations, ſet forth in Print their repentance for all their aforeſaid evils, of <hi>May</hi> 6, 1659. Saying, 

<q>
                  <hi>The</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lick concernment of this Commonwealth being through a viciſitude of dangers and back-ſlidings of many brought into that ſtate and poſture wherein they now ſtand, AND OUR SELVES alſo contributing thereunto, by wandering divers wayes, from righteous and equal paths; and alſo obſerving to our great grief that the good SPIRIT which formerly appeared amongſt us in the carrying on of this great work did daily decline, ſo as the GOOD OLD CAUSE became a reproach, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
               </q> 

And did not they and ſome of the former Commanders troubled in Conſcience as aforeſaid joyning with them, earneſtly intreat in the ſaid Printed Declaration, 

<q>(That this Parliament formerly interrupted by <hi>Oliver</hi>) would return to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and diſcharge of their truſt, promiſing them (in the ſaid Declaration) that they would be ready in their places, as becomes them to yield them their utmoſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>in ſafety, in ſetling and ſecuring the peace and freedom of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And when this Parliament with much ſelf-denial, ventured themſelves divers ways to ſit and act, and now the conſcentious Officers that afore relinquiſhed, or were ejected out of Command are reſtored to their reſpective Commands; did not the generallity of both ſorts of the Officers aforeſaid, (all pretending to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs) now again ſtop this Parliament from going to the Houſe, and therein ſeem to vomit up their repentance (repenting of that repentance) and to lick up that Vomit which formerly they had ſpewed out. And did not the Same men herein fare worſe then before; not onely in tranſgreſsing againſt their former ſelf-conviction, former examples of Conſcience, former repentings, former repentance of their indangering the whole Commonwealth, but againſt the Sage Patriots of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and pious (for the Generallity) towards God, and ſome of them brave Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and that after they had ſat half a year, mainly doing their Drudgery, getting Laws of Exciſe and Cuſtom, raiſing Taxes, and paying Souldiers by Sea and Land? Yea in the very Act of ſtopping the Speaker in Kings-ſtreet, when a Lieut. Col. buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the buſineſs, was asked why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>he did theſe things? Did he give any other anſwer, but this? That he had received a Command ſo to do. And doth not ſuch an anſwer as this make a conſidered man aſtoniſhed what might be the GODLINESS (ſo much cryed up) of a Souldier, that out of the buſineſs of War, and reſiſtance of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Legiſlative Power</hi> obey an unrighteous command (his Conſcience being witneſs) without diſpute.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Compl.</label> They were neceſſiated (they ſay) thus to ſtop the Parliament, for <hi>ſelf-preſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Quaery.</label> Is there any doubt but that <hi>ſelf</hi> was mainly in it? But is there any neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50850:3"/>
Can there be any neceſſity (if we believe that GOD Governs the World) of ſinning? Or was there ſuch a ſtreſs to be put upon Nine Mens loſing their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, wherein were imbarked onely a little <hi>future</hi> ayry <hi>honour,</hi> and durty <hi>riches,</hi> they having had enough already to make them of Low-men to live like Lords? Or is not the truth of the ſtorie, that they brought themſelves into that dammage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they count it ſo great a dammage, as to tear up all, rather then to fall into it? For, did not fourty Commanders of the North-Weſt expedition preſently after their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing things about <hi>Chester,</hi> ſubſcribe a Petition, or ſome ſuch paper to have a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and generall Officers? And when the Parliament (having private notice of it) Voted that the granting that requeſt was <hi>Needleſs, Chargeable,</hi> and <hi>Dangerous</hi> to the Common-wealth, did not 230 Officers anon after ſubſcribe a <hi>Repreſentation</hi> and Petition, wherein (beſides many ſhrew'd reflexions on the Parliament hinted, as it were of their <hi>ingratitude,</hi> their <hi>oblique admonitions</hi> of the Army, <hi>&amp;c:</hi>) deſiring of the Parliament nine Propoſals; in the ſixt and ſeventh whereof they Petition that no Officer might be put into the Army but by a Committe of <hi>Nomination,</hi> nor put out of the Army without a due proceeding at their Court Martial; and in the eigth they neatly couch that their Commander in cheife might be more fixed in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, then the condition of the Parliament it ſelf was, according to a certain Vote that they had formerly paſſed, touching the length of their ſitting? And were not theſe Propoſals obvious to be interpreted (as ſome did interpret them) That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my cold better truſt the ſaid Committe of Nomination, and Court Martial, then the Parliament; and looked more after their own Eſtabliſhment then that of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And to graſpe at a power to change the Complexion of the Army (the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Servants,) as they the Officers ſhould ſee cauſe, without the Cognizance of the Parliament their Maſter? Yet becauſe in the ſaid paper of Propoſals they did ſo often mention themſelves to be the Parliaments <hi>faithfull Servants</hi> (which title did they make good) did not the Parliament ſtrein hard to ſqueeſe out ſo much out <q>of the ſaid paper as to give them thanks for the good <hi>expreſſions</hi> of their affections, and faithfulneſs; and to tell them they had already taken into conſideration ſome of the particulars in the ſaid Repreſentation; and that they would the reſt on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> next?</q> And did not the Parliament keep their promiſe? And within few dayes were come to the ſixt Propoſall afore-named? But mean while, did not nine of their Officers, not ſtaying for the Parliaments anſwer ſubſcribe a Letter, ſending it about to the reſt to ſubſcribe it, to be ſen to the Army in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Officers in both theſe places might ſubſcribe to the ſaid Repreſentation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall, which, with the ſaid Letter (mentioned therein) they accordingly ſent the ſaid Letter? which attempt did it ſignifie leſs then that they were reſolved here in <hi>England</hi> to adhere (and to get the reſt in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to adhere if they could) to thoſe Propoſalls what ever anſwer the Parliament ſhould give them? This originall Letter with the ſaid nine hands, being brought by a Commander to whom it was ſent to ſubſcribe, unto the Parliament, was it not a ſufficient cauſe to make the Parliament the ſame day it was brought in, after long debate (for they ſat late) to vote the Commiſſions of thoſe nine Officers voyd? And thereby to experience whether the Army, or Parliament were in chiefe rule? And whether the Parliament were not better to dye in honour, then to live and looſe their Authority? Now doth this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry merit ſuch a <hi>ſelf preſervation,</hi> as muſt be attained with an univerſall deſolation of the ſafety of three Nations? Are nine mens pomp and riches, or rather only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50850:3"/>
of addition of thoſe two (for there was nothing but parchment voted away from them) balanceable againſt the peace and proſperity of three Nations? If they ſay anon the Parliament might vote out nine more and nine, <hi>&amp;c, &amp;c:</hi> Is this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly poſſible (unleſs ſo many would be as diſobedient as the firſt nine) ſeeing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament cannot be without an Army? And could the Officers of the Army, yea and ſome of the ſaid ejected Officers brook it to be uncommiſſionated by <hi>Oliver</hi> or the other ſo dealt with from time to time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their faithfulneſs to the Parliament; and are they now affraid to be voted out of Commiſſion from time to time, whilſt they ſtand faithfull to the Parliament? If they ſay (as ſome of them did that <hi>Octob.</hi> 13.) that they were forced ſo to rout or ſtop the Parliament, <hi>that they might know whether they were to live or dye:</hi> Is not this a ſtrange <hi>Ceimaera,</hi> phantiſied meerly in the braine, unbecomming men of valour, that had ſo often boldly looked death in the face? Had the Parliament had that in their hearts, might they not as eaſily have vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to be ſeiſed upon? Did this Parliament execute the King without unking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him; and could they not impriſon or puniſh Commanders of an Army, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt uncommiſſionating them? Did not therefore theſe Officers in oppoſing the Parliaments ſitting, ſeek a ſelf-preſervation rather from their own jealouſies, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al dangers? However, may not any <hi>Malefactor</hi> as Lawfully, if not more Lawfully, offer violence to an Officer of the Magiſtate, ſent by authority to arreſt, or impriſon that Malefactor, alleadging he did it out of <hi>Self-preſervation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Compl.</label> But they did put this ceſſation upon the Parliament (as they ſay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) for another reaſon, <hi>viz:</hi> becauſe the voting out of nine Officers at once did <hi>put a diſreputation upon the Army.</hi>
            </p>
