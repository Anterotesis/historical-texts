            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE LITTLE POET ACCIVS NOT knowing which way to couer the smalenesse of hys person, which was somewhat lesse then the meane, thought best to haue a great picture drawne for hys Counterfeyte: This Poet no doubt had some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this deuise, for pictures often go there, where the person whom they represent are not admitted: And it might be that strangers seeing the great shape, would imagine Accius to be a tall man. Tewcer a cunning Archer, but a faynte harted Souldiour, then wanted no courage when he was close couered with the Target of his brother Aiax. Vlisses, whose rype wyt made full amends for his weake body, thought no aduenture dangerous, though neuer so perillous, if he were protected with the shield of Pallas. So I right Noble Ladye knowing my abilitie to wryte, to bee farre lesse then the person of Accius, and so more lykely to incurre more rebukes: my courage therfore more faynte then eyther Tewcers, or Vlisses, and so more needing some strong defence, haue aduentured to place in the forefrunt of this little treatise, the tytle of your name, as a great portrature to a little body, as a sure shield to a weake War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, as a safe defence against any danger. For as they which should see the picture of Accius, would imagine it to aunswere his person: so if the Reader hereof, behold your name in the fyrst leafe, he will deeme the whole Booke the more fruitfull, and the framer therof the more skilfull: but if he shall once perceyue your Honor to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronesse to this labour, he will eyther loue it, bicause he doth honor you, or wil not dare to reproch it, bicause he perceyueth you are as ready, and knoweth you are as able to defend it, as eyther Aiax was to garde Tewcer, or Pallas to guyde Vlisses. I cannot right vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ladye, imagine there was anye greater cause that might induce Accius to frame so bigge a picture: or cause Aiax to shielde Tew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer: or mooue Pallas to regarde the safety of Vlisses: then my selfe
<pb facs="tcp:13628:3"/>
now haue to vse your Honors defence. Accius his picture might with a stranger couer the shortnesse of his person: your name shall to the Reader be recompence for the greatnesse of my ignorance. Tewcer fled to Aiax bicause he was his owne brother: I presume to seeke ayde of your Honor, bicause I am your poore seruant. Pallas did defende Vlisses bicause shee knewe he followed and loued her: Your Ladiship (I trust) wyll be my protection, bicause I honor and serue you, which I haue done in tymes past, now doe, and euer hereafter wil do, in such sorte, that the worlde should be wytnesse, if my abilitie to shew it, were as great as my wil is ready to performe it, I would be found equal in dutiful zeale towards your Honor, to Vlisses in harty affection towards Pallas. Therfore right Noble Lady, let me be bold to remember you in behalfe of my self, of that which Demosthenes is reported to haue spoken to Alexander, in defence of the Athenians. You haue (sayd he) most worthy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, by fortune no greater good then that you maye: by nature no better gifte then that you wishe to doe good to many. The cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and estimation your vertuous lyfe, and rare wisdome hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured you: the honorable curtesie and sweete behauiour wherewith Nature hath plentifully endued you, shal not be eyther vnfitly or vnfruitfully vsed, if you shal vouchsafe to imploy the one in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and shew the other in good acceptance of this slender worke of your seruant, which as I did wryte at ydle times in your house, to auoyde greater ydlenesse or worse businesse: so I present it humbly vnto you, as a testimony of my bounden dutie, euer crauing your Honor to pardon my bolde presumption: and styl beseeching the Almightye to blesse you in earth with much honour, and in heauen to crowne you with eternall felicitie.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>WHere none but Nature is the guyde, <hi>Minerua</hi> hath no parte,</l>
               <l>Then you her Nurcelings beare with him, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knows no aide of arte.</l>
               <l>I wake my wyts to please my selfe, nought reaking praise or blame,</l>
               <l>I force my pen to purge my brayne, though matter small I frame.</l>
               <l>In which attempt, if lack of skill, haue led my Muse awry,</l>
               <l>Let my well meaning minde the misse, in eche respect supply.</l>
               <l>If patterns wrought by Arte, of curious workman here thou seeke,</l>
               <l>Thy trauayle then thou shalt but lose, to looke and neuer léeke.</l>
               <l>But if good will may thée suffise, peruse, and take thy pleasure,</l>
               <l>In Natures schoole my little skill: I learned all by leasure.</l>
               <l>Here nothing placed is, that may the vertuous sorte offende,</l>
               <l>Though enuious Carpers barke and snarle, at things they scarce can mende.</l>
               <l>Whose chiefest grace is wise to séeme, by blotting others déedes,</l>
               <l>Whose paynted flowers in proofe full oft, fall out but stincking wéedes.</l>
               <l>The chaste desyre with honest ryme, mistykes no whitt in minde,</l>
               <l>But venomde Spyders poyson take, where Bée doth honey finde.</l>
               <l>With greater ease a fault is founde, then well to welde the reste:</l>
               <l>It differs much to fell the tale, and words misplasté to wresté.</l>
               <l>By patterns here displayed to thée, thou mayst perhaps preuente</l>
               <l>The poysoning bayts of bitter swéete, whose blisse brings sharp euente.</l>
               <l>Disloyall loue and filthie lust, thou here art taught to flée:</l>
               <l>With other Sawes to sundry endes, though he wed rough they bée.</l>
               <l>That lyfe is lyke a Bubble blowne, or smoke that soone doth passe,</l>
               <l>That all our pleasures are but paynes, our glorie brittle glasse.</l>
               <l>That Fortunes fruites are variable, no holde in Princely mace:</l>
               <l>That womens myndes are mutable, that death drawes on apace.</l>
               <l>That worldly pompe is vanity, that youth vnwares decayes:</l>
               <l>That high estate is slipperie, that onely vertue stayes.</l>
               <l>Here learne thou mayst: with diuers notes, gaynst fraude and flattery,</l>
               <l>That may suffise to warne the wise, to voyde such battery.</l>
               <l>And eke thou here mayst viewe and see, howe Be wtie cruell haste:</l>
               <l>Doth make, to shun the gallant face, where she but late was plaste.</l>
               <l>That she is Natures priueledge, and so is sayd to bée</l>
               <l>Because the seldom giues that gyfte, but where she cause doth sée.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13628:6"/>
That beawtie is a dumbe disceite, not hauing worde or arte:</l>
               <l>And yet with stlente crafte she can, perswade the hardest harte.</l>
               <l>She conqueres where she coms by kinde: for Creatures faire procure,</l>
               <l>By naked lookes, such yéelding harts, as they wishe to allure.</l>
               <l>Whose vayne delyghts if thou vesier, thy thryfte goes to the grounde,</l>
               <l>(And yet by honest loue we see, the greatest wealth is founde.)</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Apollos</hi> troope my faults will passe, and waye my want hercin,</l>
               <l>Whose freindly fauor if I gaine, I prise not <hi>Pan</hi> a pin.</l>
               <l>The trauell myne, the pleasure thine, if ought thou here doe léeke,</l>
               <l>Thy good reporte, for paynes ymployed is sole rewarde I séeke.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>SIthe kindled coales close kept, continue longest quick,</l>
                  <l>And secret smarte with greater power, the pensiue minde doth prick.</l>
                  <l>Why should I cloke the griefe, from whence such passions grow,</l>
                  <l>Unlesse my braine by Pen I purge, my brest they ouerflow.</l>
                  <l>When night with quyet pause, eche creature cals to rest,</l>
                  <l>Through quelling cares &amp; pinching thoughts, I lye so sore oprest,</l>
                  <l>That from my setling downe, vntill the tyme I rise,</l>
                  <l>Sléepe hardly wins the force to close, my watchful drooping eies.</l>
                  <l>The Skrich Owle me besides, her dolefull tunes doth shréeke,</l>
                  <l>Whose cryes my cares may represent, that rest in vaine do séeke.</l>
                  <l>To thinke on the mishaps, which daylie me betyde,</l>
                  <l>When surest hope of swéete redresse, I sée away doth slyde.</l>
                  <l>The hardest harte by proofe, doth yéelde an inwarde pante,</l>
                  <l>When good desyres are deprest, by wrack of <hi>Irus</hi> wante.</l>
                  <l>Wante makes best natures fall, that else would vpright stand:</l>
                  <l>Want makes the valiant faynt in feares, though strong be harte &amp; hand.</l>
                  <l>Want drowns in dollor déepe, the pleasants wits y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bée,</l>
                  <l>Want daunts the finste conceited head, and makes it dull we sée.</l>
                  <l>Wante makes the olde wyfe trot, the yong to run outright,</l>
                  <l>Wante makes the noblest hart &amp; mind, to séeme but base in sight.</l>
                  <l>Wante makes the Lyon stowte, a slender pray to léeke,</l>
                  <l>Want plucks the Pecocks plume adown, want makes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mighty méeke</l>
                  <l>Want is the sowrce whence sorrows spring, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hasts y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lifes decay,</l>
                  <l>Want loads the hart with heaped cares, that crush al ioys away.</l>
                  <l>Néede hath no lawe some say, extremes, extremes doe vrge,</l>
                  <l>The passions that by want do pain, what phisick wel may purge?</l>
                  <l>Unhappy is the hower, that such sharp sicknesse brings,</l>
                  <l>And thrise vnhappy is the wretch, whom want so deadly stings.</l>
                  <l>Aye me that such sowre sawce, false Fortune should procure,</l>
                  <l>When slylie forth she séemes to throw, her traine on golden lure.</l>

                  <l>To pierce the woful hart of mine, which now with care is spent.</l>
                  <l>Whose hard and crooked fate, increasing euery hower,</l>
                  <l>Doth force me wake when others sléepe, where Fortune doth not lower.</l>
                  <l>And when the dawning daye, I doe perceyue and sée,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>WHen spring in lyuely gréene, eche fielde hath deckt anewe,</l>
                  <l>And strowde the soyle with flowers swéete of sundry kinds of hewe.</l>

                  <l>Inuites the weary dulled minde, abroad to take delight.</l>
                  <l>Then I by fancie led, a tyme to sporte and play,</l>
                  <l>To Forrest fayre of pleasant ayre, began to take the way.</l>
                  <l>And as I past through out a Ualley fayre and gréene,</l>
                  <l>Where sundrye swéete &amp; rare delights, I earst had heard &amp; séene.</l>

                  <l>In shrubs hard shrowded by, a wofull wight there lay,</l>
                  <l>Whose corps through care &amp; lingering griefe, was welny worne away.</l>
                  <l>Where powring out his plainte he curst the tyme, and when</l>
                  <l>That fyrst on earth he placed was, to lead his lyfe with men.</l>
                  <l>Whose selfeloue séemth so swéete, that friendship yéeldes no tast,</l>
                  <l>And double dealing gaines such price, that plainenesse is displast.</l>
                  <l>Alas, quoth he the Babes, one wombe brought forth and bare.</l>
                  <l>Will nowe obiect, what are we bounde, the one to others care.</l>
                  <l>Whereas good nature bids, go méete thy friends distresse,</l>
                  <l>And beare some parte of his mishap, that he may beare the lesse.</l>
                  <l>If friend to friend thus doe, who faster friend should bee,</l>
                  <l>Then he (alas) in thy distresse, that nought will doe for thée.</l>
                  <l>Ah wofull man he sayth, thy lotte hath falne thée so,</l>
                  <l>That sowrce of sorrowes thée besets, with waues of wailful wo.</l>
                  <l>When he where fauour most, thou shouldst by nature finde,</l>
                  <l>Doth causelesse shake thée of in care, &amp; shewes himselfe vnkinde.</l>
                  <l>O wretch in dolor drencht, O minde with mone opprest,</l>
                  <l>O gulfe of griefe, O sea of sighes, that straine the pensiue brest.</l>

                  <l>Drawe néere you <hi>Satyrs</hi> fower, and straine your dolefull cryes,</l>

                  <l>For better twere of bothe, then restlesse still remayne,</l>
                  <l>By ending quyte my lothed lyfe, to ende my lingering payne.</l>
                  <l>Here sparing further spéeche, aside he cast his eye,</l>
                  <l>And fynding me, as one dismayde, away he sought to flye.</l>
                  <l>Whose will when I perceaude, to shunne my sight full bente,</l>
                  <l>I to him stept, and askte the cause, that moude him to lamente.</l>
                  <l>Wherto no worde he gaue, but stands like one amazde,</l>
                  <l>And with a strange and gastly looke, long tyme on me he gazde.</l>
                  <l>His face was thinne and leane, his collour dim as leade,</l>
                  <l>His chéeks were wanne, his body weake, his eyes déepe sunck in head.</l>
                  <l>His hart straynde, his minde tost, his wyt with woe nere worne,</l>
                  <l>A rufull thing it was (alas) to viewe him so forlorne.</l>
                  <l>With déepe fet sighe from brest, sent forth by inwarde payne,</l>
                  <l>His féeble voice and foltring tongue, he gan at last to strayne.</l>
                  <l>And thus to me he sayde: O what art thou in wo:</l>
                  <l>Me Myser wretche that here dost finde, with griefe perplexed so?</l>
                  <l>Whose present state to learne, why dost thou thus require?</l>
                  <l>Smale gayne to thée, great paine to me, to yéelde so thy desire.</l>
                  <l>Yet sithe against my will, thine eares haue heard the plainte,</l>
                  <l>Which in this desarte place I paste, to ease my brest attainte.</l>
                  <l>Thus much at thy request, I further will reueale,</l>
                  <l>As for the rest this corps of mine, for euer shall conceale.</l>
                  <l>Whom earst a friend I founde, me causlesse hath forsaken,</l>
                  <l>What wouldst thou more this is the summe, that I with sighes am shaken.</l>
                  <l>But cruel fate I feare, doth force it so to be,</l>
