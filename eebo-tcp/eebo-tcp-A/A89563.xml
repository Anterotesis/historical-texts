         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But when after ſome friendly conference with you, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to me, that if you might enjoy liberty to exerciſe your Miniſtery, in ſome place where you ſhould not be put upon the practice of baptizing of Infants, you could (yea,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113537:5"/>
and intimated to me that you would) keepe this Opinion private to your ſelfe, provided onely, that if any ſhould preach in your Pulpit for the Baptizing of them, you ſhould take your ſelf bound in the ſame place to preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; otherwiſe Mens preaching or printing abroad, ſhould be no provocation to you. (In hope whereof, my ſelf endeavoured to help you in to the place where now you are, deſiring the Church might not loſe the benefit of thoſe good gifts which God hath beſtowed upon you.) And thereupon I tooke no further thought of any preſent Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of your large Treatiſe, having my hands full of other employments, becauſe I verily thought you would have ſate quietly down, preached Chriſt, kept your Opinion to your ſelf, and not have any further appeared (eſpecially at this time) to increaſe the flame of our Diviſions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions.</p>
               <p>But ſince you think it neceſſary to deprive the Infants of Beleevers, of that which wee conceive to bee their glorious priviledge; yea, and looke upon all other endeavours of Reformation, as things which will come to nothing, till this opinion of yours prevaile (ſo dearely are you in love with your own Babe) and come out into the field ſo bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, and gaint-like, to tread down all who ſtand againſt your way: I have (with the Lords aſſiſtance) undertaken your pompous Treatiſe; and as farre as my impaired health, and other ſervices would permit, indeavoured to bring your <hi>Examen</hi> to the tryall, with as much brevity and cleareneſſe as I could poſſibly; and I hope alſo, with ſo much evidence of truth, that there ſhall be no need of a Colledge to make any further anſwer unto you. Wherein I ſhall not (as you have done) carpe at every phraſe or expreſſion, nor digreſſe into impertinent Diſcourſes, thereby to ſwell up a volume; nor amuſe the Reader with multitudes of Quotations of Latine and Greek Authors, and then turn them into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh; nor frame as many ſenſes of an expreſſion as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and then confute them, and ſo fight with men of ſtraw of mine own fitting up; nor ſpend a whole ſheet of Paper together, in confuting what was never intended by my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,

               <p>But firſt give me leave to obſerve your <hi>deſtructive Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> It is the <hi>Socinians</hi> way to elude all Texts of Scripture which are urged againſt them, if they have been differently expounded by Learned and Godly men, ancient or modern: to queſtion all concluſions infer'd by conſequence from Scripture: to deride the teſtimonies of any of the Ancients, by diſcovering the nakedneſſe, error, and overſight of thoſe Reverend men: and by making themſelves merry by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Orations, Epiſtles, or alluſions of the Fathers into Syllogiſmes: and by inſerting of <hi>Ergo,</hi> now and then, to make all their Rhetoricall paſſages ſeem ridiculous. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the judicious Reader, whether this plot be not carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through your <hi>Examen</hi> &amp; Exercitation. Eſpecially I obſerve your maine faculty to lye in framing ſpecious anſwers to Arguments brought to prove any thing. Your great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in your Exercitation is; if <hi>I can anſwer all Arguments for baptizing Infants, then &amp;c.</hi> And then you form the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument into ſeverall ſhapes, and ſeek to clude them; and herein I confeſſe you are dextrous. The reſt of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherein you doe aſſert, or goe directly to prove; alaſſe how inconſequent are they, as will appeare when they come to bee examined. The like courſe you take in your <hi>Examen,</hi> laying out abundance of ſtrength in the <hi>anoſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that the Reader may ſee what you doe not like, but he may ſtay long enough before you bring ſatisfying arguments to ſettle him in that which you <hi>would have,</hi> when you have ſtartled him, in what you <hi>would not have.</hi> But this kind of diſputing never edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Church: what one book was ever written by any of our Divines, even in the great point of Juſtification, or Faith; which ſome learned and ſubtle Papiſt hath not been able to cloud and ſlur in ſuch a way of anſwering? Well, however I proceed to your <hi>Examen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:113537:6"/>
And I begin with your Prologue, wherein you declare <note place="margin">Reply to the Preface.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>the occaſion and end of this your writing; the ſum whereof you make to bee this. Firſt, you ſent (as you ſay) Nine Arguments drawne up in Latine to a Committee appointed (as you were informed) to give ſatisfaction about points of Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme; afterward Three Arguments more, with a ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome other things in writing, which were delivered to Mr.</hi> Tuckney, <hi>and by him joyned to the other Papers; your intent being either to give or receive ſatisfaction in this great point; but to this day (much contrary to your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation) you have had no returne from the Committee. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, you are more provoked by ſome paſſages in a Sermon of Mr.</hi> Vines. <hi>Thirdly, and by a compariſon in my Sermon, between</hi> Hazaels <hi>cruelty to the Infants of the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the</hi> Anabaptiſts. <hi>Fourthly, you finde mee too ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement in maintaining of this point, of which you and others ſee no ground. Fifthly, yea Mr.</hi> Dan. Rogers <hi>confeſſes himſelfe unconvinced by demonſtration of Scripture for it. Sixthly, that Mr.</hi> Ball <hi>cuts the ſinewes of the Argument drawn from Circumciſion. Seventhly, that</hi> Muſculus <hi>at length found</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. <hi>impertinent to prove this point. Eighth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to conclude, upon your beſt ſearch, you are confirmed that it is an Innovation maintained by dangerous principles, a thing not to bee acquitted from Will-worſhip; that it hath occaſioned many errors in Doctrine, corruptions in Diſcipline and manners, unneceſſary and vaine diſputes, and almoſt quite changed the Ordinance of Baptiſme, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſum of your Introduction; to which, becauſe it is but a pompous dumb ſhew, I ſhall returne a very briefe anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for your Latine buſineſſe ſent to the Committee, I thought you had not been ignorant, that the worke of Committees, is but to prepare matter for the Aſſembly; but neither Committees nor Aſſembly have power to anſwer any thing, ſent from any (except from the honorable Houſes) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave from the Parliament. And if you pleaſe now to take notice of it, you will no longer wonder why the Committee hath made no return to your private Paper; this I thinke
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113537:6"/>
is ſufficient to remove your firſt ſtumbling block: onely I am further to tell you from <hi>Mr. Tuckney,</hi> that hee deſires you to get better evidence for what you relate concerning him; for the truth is, he neither mediately nor immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received any Papers from you, nor joyned your 3 laſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to your 9 firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, your offence at a paſſage in <hi>Mr. Vines</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ſhall bee conſidered in the place where you againe repeate it, and aggravate it to the utmoſt, <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as to your exaggerating my alluſion to <hi>Hazaels</hi> practice. I anſwer, I compared not <hi>their intentions</hi> with <hi>his,</hi> but the fruit of their <hi>principles;</hi> caſting all beleevers Children as much out of the Covenant of Grace, as they do the Children of Turks and Pagans and therein you your ſelf joyn with them. Now whether ſuch a compariſon might not be uſed without any further Apologie, I leave the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Reader to judge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whether my proofs for this Doctrine are weak, uncertaine, far-fetch't, ſhall God willing appeare to them, who wil impartially read and compare your book and mine together.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, as for what you ſuggeſt from my Reverend and Learned Friend, <hi>Mr. Dan. Rogers,</hi> although enough might be taken out of his words in that book, to declare his own meaning; I rather chuſe to ſet it downe in the very words which he wrote to me in a Letter, bearing date the 29 of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> laſt paſt, in way of anſwer to a Letter which I wrote to him; wherein I requeſted of him to know, what in his name I ſhould anſwer to this paſſage of your book: his words are theſe; <hi>If I were to anſwer that Anabaptiſt, I ſhould anſwer him</hi> ſilentio &amp; contemptu: <hi>for why ſhould I not? ſince in that very place of my Sacraments,</hi> part 1. p. 78, 79. <hi>where I confute thoſe Schiſmaticks, he ſnatches my words from their own defence. My words are, I confeſſe my ſelfe unconvinced by any demonſtration of Scripture for Paedo-Baptiſme, meaning, by any poſitive Text; what is that to helpe him? Except I thought there were no other arguments to evince it: Now what I thinke of that, my next words ſhew,</hi> pag. 77. lin. 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>I need not tranſcribe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113537:7"/>
them. In a mord, this I ſay, though I know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, yet that is no argument for the non-Baptizing of Infants; ſince ſo many Scriptures are ſufficiently convincing for it. Therefore this want of a poſitive Text muſt no more exclude Inſants, &amp;c. then the like reaſon ſhould diſanull a Chriſtian Sabbath, or Women-kind not to be partakers of the Supper: The quoting of mine own Text were enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. If <hi>Mr. Ball</hi> cut the ſinewes of the Argument from Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to Baptiſme, himſelf was very much miſtaken in his owne meaning and intentions, who in the very ſame place alledged by you, uſes the ſame Argument, &amp; makes the parallel to lie in the ſame things which my Sermon doth: you might have done well to have informed the Reader ſo much, when you uſed his authority to overthrow that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: his words are theſe, <q>Circumciſion and Baptiſme are both Sacraments of Divine inſtitution, and ſo they argree in the ſubſtance of the things ſignified, the Perſons to whom they are to be adminiſtred, and the order of adminiſtration, if the right proportion be obſerved: as Circumciſion ſealed the entrance into the Covenant, the righteouſneſſe of Faith, and Circumciſion of the heart; ſo doth Baptiſme much more clearly; as, <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Houſhold, and the Infants of beleeving Jewes, were to bee Circumciſed; ſo the faithfull, their families, and their ſeed are to be baptized. Circumciſion was to bee but once applyed by Gods appointment; and the ſame holds in Baptiſme, according to the will and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, I perceive you glory much that <hi>Muſculus</hi> hath deſerted 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. as an impertinent proofe for bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Infants, and you repeat it at leaſt three or foure times in your book: and I obſerve through out your whole Treatiſe, that when any Authour joynes with you in any particular, you improve his authority to the utmoſt; which makes me conceive, that it would be a great glory to you, to be able to prove a conſent of Learned men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with you in your way. And therefore I cannot but wonder that you ſhould ſo much ſlight and undervalue
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113537:7"/>
the Judgements of Fathers and Councells, Harmonies and Confeſſions of whole Churches, when they differ from you. As for <hi>Muſculus,</hi> whether he changed his Judgement upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. on good grounds, ſhall be examined in due place: In the meane time I informe the Reader that in the ſame place <hi>Muſculus</hi> acknowledges that there are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments enough, and ſufficiently ſtrong to prove baptizing of Infants, though this 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. be left out. And if <hi>Muſculus</hi> Opinion ſway in the one, I hope it's not to bee rejected in the other.</p>
               <p>Eightly, whether <hi>Dignum tanto tulit hic promiſſor hiatn;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your roaſt be anſwerable to your great boaſt; Whether your Arguments and Anſwers will make good this high charge that Paedo-Baptiſme is an Innovation, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon dangerous principles, &amp;c. we proceed now to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine.</p>
               <p>And firſt wee ſhall inquire concerning the Hiſtoricall <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Becauſe many of the Anabaptiſts ſhame not to ſay, That the Ancients, eſpecially the Greek Church, rejected Infant-Baptiſme for many hundred yeares: I ſaid in the beginning of my Sermon, that the Chriſtian Church hath been in the poſſeſſion of it for the ſpace of 1500 years and upward, and named a few teſtimonies out of the Greeke and Latine Fathers, in little more then one page, to make this good; no wayes intending to make the weight of the Queſtion to hang in any degree upon humane teſtimonies or conſent of authority, but onely upon the evidence of the Word; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this you have beſtowed two or three ſheets of your book, and as if all Antiquity run on your fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Truly Sir, your undertaking is very high and confident, and I ſhall diligently weigh with what ſtrength you perform it; and ſhall therefore more fully inquire into the practice of Antiquity in this point, then elſe I ſhould have judged convenient to doe. As for that which you tooke for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That there are plaine teſtimonies for Epiſcopacy, the Religious uſe of the Croſſe, &amp;c. before any teſtimonies can be produced for the baptizing of Infants, pardon mee that I forbear to beleeve you till you have made it good. I have already alledged ſome, and ſhall now (God willing) alledge more teſtimonies to prove that in the Judgement of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, the baptizing of Infants was received in all ages, and from the very Apoſtles, as a divine Inſtitution. I read no ſuch thing for Epiſcopacy, as a diſtinct order from Presbytery; your ſelfe may read in Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> his Epiſtle to Sir <hi>Francis Knolls,</hi> that in the Judgement of <hi>Ambroſe, Chryſoſtome, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Theodoret, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Primaſius, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulius, Gregorius, and many other,</hi> that Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were all one by <hi>divine Inſtitution,</hi> and that <hi>Eccleſiasticall conſtitution</hi> made the difference between them. Much leſſe doe I read among them, that the Religious uſe of the Croſſe was received in all ages, and that as a divine Inſtitution. If you can make it out that theſe things were ſo, you will do a very acceptable ſervice to the <hi>Papists, Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall Party,</hi> who no doubt will return you hearty thanks, if your evidence be correſpondent to your confidence. If you cannot, you ſhould doe well to revoke this bold aſſertion. In the meane time I ſhall examine your <hi>Examen,</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity produced to make good the practice of the Ancient Church in Paedo-Baptiſme. The firſt whereof was taken from <hi>Juſtine Martyr.</hi>

Before you fall upon the examination of the teſtimony, you ſay, <hi>Hee was a Greeke, and wrote in Greeke; but wee have his Works in Latine, except ſome fragments:</hi> this you conceive to be a <hi>reaſon why we cannot be ſo certain of his meaning, as we ſhould be, if wee had his owne words in the language in which he wrote:</hi> and may not this Objection lie againſt any Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever? and upon that ground you may ſlight it.

                  </gap>, <hi>the waſhing of the new birth,</hi> or Regeneration: and what that is but Baptiſme, yet I know not. To me the Apoſtle ſeemes plainely to parallel the waſhing of regeneration, and the renewing of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, as type and countertype. And the Analogie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween waſhing in Baptiſme, and Regeneration, lies in that cuſtome of waſhing Infants from the pollutions of the wombe when they are firſt born. A learned Critick of <note place="margin">Mr. Mede.</note> our own in his <hi>Diatriba</hi> upon that place, thinkes none will deny that in theſe words <hi>the waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is ſpeaking of Baptiſme: ſure I am, moſt of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters which I have ſeen upon that place agree that he either argues directly from Baptiſme, or at leaſt alludes to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you grant, though the word <hi>renaſcuntur is uſed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113537:11"/>
for Baptiſme by the Ancients</hi> (which before you ſeemed to pin on <hi>Feuardentius</hi> his ſleeve) <hi>yet poſſibly it was not the word uſed by Irenaeus in his owne writing.</hi> It ſeems, now you dare not ſtand upon the ſtrength of the word <hi>renaſcuntur,</hi> becauſe you confeſſe it was uſed by the Ancients for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; therefore your conjecture here is, That <hi>poſſibly it was not the word uſed by Irenaeus for Baptiſme in his own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> I ſhall goe further then you (and yet not wrong the truth) and ſay, undoubtedly, <hi>renaſcuntur</hi> was not the word uſed by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his owne writing, for he wrote in Greek, and therefore it may well be conceived he ſaid not <hi>renaſcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> though he might ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: But to that which you anſwer, I adde, you know 'tis commonly ſaid in the Schooles, <hi>fortè ita, ſolvitur per fortè non:</hi> you ſay, poſſibly it was not <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his word. I anſwer, poſſible it is that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> might uſe the Greek word, which is well tranſlated <hi>renaſcuntur:</hi> for why might not hee being a Grecian, ſpeak of Baptiſme in the phraſe and ſtile as other Grecians did? yea, that he did ſpeake ſo, is moſt probable, becauſe that other Greek Fathers uſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a new birth,</hi> in the ſenſe in which I alledged it.</p>
               <p>As for the altering of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his mind by the Latin Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, not having his works in his owne language, I dare not ſay ſo much: when you bring forth <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his words in Greek, I ſhall the better be inabled to judge of it; in the meane time I accept of the Tranſlation, having made it good by parallel phraſes in other Greek Fathers.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place you labour to prove, That <hi>it is not meant of Baptiſme from Irenaeus his ſcope in that place.</hi> To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 6.</note> albeit that bee granted which you ſay was his ſcope there, yet his words prove the queſtion in debate before us. I hope you will not deny, but that the ſcope of a ſpeech may tend to prove one thing; and yet the expreſſions uſed may give light to otherthings: was not the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> his ſcope by the <hi>parable of dry bones riſing again,</hi> to prove the reſtauration of the Jews (who then ſeemed to be dead) <note place="margin">Ezek. 37.</note> to their former ſtate? that no doubt was the drift, yet hee layes it forth by that parable: and <hi>Tertullian</hi> by the <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:113537:11"/>
ſame proves the Reſurrection at the laſt day, if hee had not beleeved that dead bones were to riſe againe (ſaith the father) how could hee by that Simile taken from them prove the Reſurrection of the Jewes? So may I ſay here, let it be ſuppoſed that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his drift is, as you ſay, to prove that Chriſt was an Infant to ſanctifie Infants, yet hee ſayes they were renewed when they were baptized. As for <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his judgement of Chriſts living upon the earth about 50. yeers, it was not alleadged by me, therefore I leave it to you to helpe <hi>Irenaeus</hi> therein, becauſe you alledge it. Now I deſire the Reader to caſt his eye back upon all that you have ſaid about this teſtimony, and ſee whether you have brought forth any thing to obſcure the light that it gives to our queſtion: all the ſtrength of what you ſaid lay in the word <hi>renaſcuntur,</hi> whether that ſignified Baptiſme or no: which by the uſuall language of the Grecians I have made good againſt your exception, and ſo I paſſe from your examen of this Author and follow you to the next.</p>
               <p>In the third place you come to ſift <hi>Origens</hi> teſtimony: <q>Where, firſt, you queſtion the authority of the booke; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <note place="margin">

In all which I hope to manifeſt your miſtakings, and ſo to diſcover the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your premiſes, that they ſhall not in any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man his judgement be able to draw theſe concluſions after them.</q>

Martyr</hi> maintaines the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie of Jeſus Chriſt, yet we know hee lived long before <hi>Arius</hi> the ring-leader of that curſed Sect which denied it: can any man conclude that <hi>Iuſt.

               <p>Then you tell us <hi>Origen calls Infant-baptizing an Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call tradition, according to the obſervance of the Church.</hi> This cavill I prevented when I quoted the teſtimony, which ſeemes to have ſome weight in it, for you grant what I ſaid about Traditions, which is warrant enough to me to adde no more to juſtifie it, otherwiſe (beſides the teſtimony of Scripture which I named in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 15.) many other out of Antiquitie may be added, where Tradition is taken in that ſenſe. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> calls Baptiſme and other myſteries ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <note place="margin">Epiph. in ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Traedition:</hi> had it appeared as a new notion not heard of in the Church before, then had it been fit he ſhould have confirmed what he ſaid: but it being a poſition, which (as he ſayes the Church obſerved) hee needed not to prove it. <hi>Ignatius</hi> preſſes upon <hi>Hiero</hi> to attend to reading and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and cals thoſe things <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Theſe are your premiſes which now being anſwered, your concluſions infer'd from thence, of themſelves muſt fall to the ground: for if Infant-baptiſme came from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and was generally obſerved in the Church in <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi> time, then you have no reaſon to challenge <hi>it as a thing not known before his time, nor delivered over to the Church in his time:</hi> albeit he expreſt it under the name of an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Tradition.</p>

               <p>Theſe are the Greek Authors alledged by me, none of which are denyed by you to teſtifie the practice of the Church in this point in their ſeverall ages, onely your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions have been all on the by, not againſt the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies themſelves, which yet (notwithſtanding what you have anſwered) I doubt not will by any judicious Reader

                     <hi>P.</hi> 9.</note> adde 3 Arguments to ſhew that Infant-Baptiſme was not known in the Greek Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if it had been known among them; <hi>you wonder why I finde nothing for it in Euſebius, Ignatius, Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus, Athanaſius,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius?</hi> To this I ſay, they ſpake to the clearing of ſuch queſtions as were afoot in their times: had any queſtion been ſtarted when they wrote about Paedo-baptiſme, no doubt they would have cleared it, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did, and as it was done in the Councell of <hi>Neocaeſarea.</hi> It is enough to mee that none of the Authors named by you ſpeake againſt it; can wee ſay that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers living before the Pelagians troubled the Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the traduction of originall ſin, becauſe they ſpake not clearly of it, before it was denyed by thoſe curſed He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques. Nor is it any glory to you that your Error was not ancient enough to be confuted by <hi>Euſebius, Ignatius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Athanaſius,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of theſe named by you ſpake for Infant-Baptiſme, ſhall now bee conſidered. I finde even in ſome of them which you have named; expreſſions which doth induce mee to beleeve that they were farre from rejecting of Paedo-baptiſme.</p>
               <p>I will not ſearch into them all, for if any thing were brought out of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> you would tell mee that you did not know <hi>Ignatius</hi> when you ſee him, (as you have done with others named before) and I have no time to wrangle. You deſire to know what <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> ſaith? why, <note place="margin">Vide Clem. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex. paedagog.</note> ſure he had none but great Infants to his Scholars; if you (who pretend to be acquainted familiarly with the ſecrets of antiquity) be acquainted with him, you'll know what I meane: He deſired (as it is likely more Greeke Fathers who were converted from Paganiſme did) to ſet forth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in ſuch a way as might move other Pagans to come and make confeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, that ſo they might be added to the Church by Baptiſme in ſuch a way
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113537:14"/>
as was proper to the baptizing of grown men. The next (whoſe teſtimony you miſſe) is <hi>Athanaſius:</hi> you deſire mee to quote any thing out of him to prove the Greeke Church did admit Infants to Baptiſme; if that will make you ceaſe wondering, I'll doe it: what ſay you to that paſſage in <hi>Athanaſius?</hi> where hee is ſhewing how we are buryed with Chriſt in Baptiſme, and riſe againe; hee ſayes, <hi>the dipping of the Infant quite under water thrice, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>

               <p>Theſe words then which are ſafe &amp; ſound, grounded upon the ſame Scripture which I have much inſiſted on, are read in the works of <hi>Athanaſius:</hi> where the queſtion is about Infants dying, requiring a reſolution that might clearly ſet forth, whether they goe to be puniſhed, or to the Kingdom? <note place="margin">

Therefore you cannot by theſe queſtions infer that Children were not baptized, ſeeing theſe Authors certifie that queſtions were put to them, and alſo tell us who anſwered for them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you conceive <hi>becauſe many children borne of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian parents were not baptized when they were young;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not their cuſtome to baptize Infants.

This opinion of the efficacy of Baptiſme to doe away ſinne, might induce them to defer it untill they were ready to leave the world, that by baptiſme then admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to them, in their opinion, all their ſinnes might bee done away. But <hi>Naz.</hi> confutes ſuch, telling them <hi>all

               <p>It is cleare upon theſe and the like grounds (but how juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I leave it to you to judge) many put off their owne baptiſme. Neither doe I ſee why that others alſo may not be thought (even upon no better grounds) to have defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the baptiſme of their Infants; which yet doth no wayes prejudice the commonly received, and conſtantly practiced ordinance of Infants-Baptiſme, no more then the above-named practiſe may bee brought to prove that it was not the received practiſe of the Church to baptize ſuch as were converted from Paganiſme to Chriſtianity, at their firſt converſion.</p>
               <p>Yet here I cannot but adde further, that ſometimes it might fall out that Chriſtians might not have the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of bringing their Children to Baptiſme, becauſe they dwelt among Infidels, or Paynims, where they could not enjoy the benefit of the Word and Sacraments for themſelves or their children: therefore in ſuch a caſe they were neceſſitated to put off the baptizing of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. <hi>Greg.

               <p>I come to the inſtances here given by you: the firſt is <hi>Conſtantine the Great, (though the ſonne of Helena, who is</hi>

The true cauſe why he received not Baptiſme at his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (ſo neare as I can gather it from the ſtory of his life) was this: <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his Father, albeit a man of a ſweet temper, and a Prince wonderfull tender of the welfare of all his Subjects; firſt out of the mildneſſe of his nature fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured Chriſtians; (ſeeing and obſerving their unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able converſation and faithfulneſſe in all their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:) therefore he did not in an hoſtile way purſue their Religion, as others Emperors did: yea, at length he grew to a good eſteem of it, eſpecially towards the latter
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113537:17"/>
end of his life: in this time his ſon <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, lived in <hi>Diocleſian</hi> his Court, from whence (his life being twice in danger) he ſuddenly eſcaping, came to his father then ſick, and preſently upon his death, hee was by the Army ſaluted Emperour: Theſe things conſidered, it is no marvaile if hee were not baptized in his Infancy; when, for ought I read, his Parents had not then embraced the Chriſtian Religion when he returned at his Fathers death, he was 30 yeares of age: and whether ever his Father was baptized, the ſtory is ſilent. Neither is <hi>Helena</hi> her affection to Religion in his Infancy, related in the Story, though afterwards it is often mentioned. You need not then wonder, why when hee was an Infant hee was not baptized: inaſmuch as it appears not that his Parents were then become Chriſtians; yea, and himſelfe alſo was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever many years, as is apparent in the ſtory.</p>

Laſtly, ſome defer'd their Baptiſme, that they might the better prepare themſelves to receive it; and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hee for a while might bee ranked in the third ſort of them, that for ſuch a thing put off their Baptiſme: yet himſelfe reaſons ſtrongly againſt delayes of that nature, in that Oration, which peradventure was after hee was better informed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you bring in <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> among your inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Nor <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi>

His educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his younger time was under <hi>Libanius,</hi> who was an enemy to Chriſtianity, and a ſcoffer at it, untill he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 20 years of age: then changing his former ſtudies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and profeſſion, he came to <hi>Meletius,</hi> by whom being inſtructed in divine knowledge, within 3 yeares afterwards he was baptized of him. After his mothers death, he betook himſelfe to a Monaſticall life, in which time hee was much furthered in his holy ſtudies by <hi>Carterius</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> to whom he often repaired.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered (which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> his own words make out) you can hardly perſwade your Reader that there

That this may appeare, I will ſet downe the words of the Canon, the occaſion of it, and what the Gloſſator (mentioned by you) ſayes of the ſame. The words of the Canon are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of her that is with Child,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The occaſion of this Canon was this, as both your Gloſſators obſerve, it was propounded to the Fathers in that Councell, to know whether a Woman when ſhee is with child might be baptized or no? ſome oppoſed it,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113537:19"/>
becauſe (as they thought) in her Baptiſme, the childe in her wombe was alſo baptized: and this they held could not bee, becauſe there is required of him that would profeſſe himſelfe a follower of Chriſt (as <hi>Zonaras</hi> expounds the laſt words of the Canon) <hi>a free election:</hi> or (as <hi>Balſamon</hi> hath it) there is required of every one in Baptiſme his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which an Infant in its mothers wombe cannot doe: at length it is determined in the Canon, the woman in that condition might bee baptized when ſhee would, &amp;c. from whence your friend <hi>Grotius</hi> infers, <hi>That the childe uſeth</hi>

                  <hi>not to bee baptized but of its owne proper will and profeſſion:</hi> and to back this aſſertion, hee addes ſome words from <hi>Balſamon</hi> and <hi>Zonaras,</hi> as if <hi>Balſamon</hi> had denyed that any were to be baptized, but ſuch as were able of themſelves to make confeſſion of their faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To vindicate the truth here from <hi>Grotius</hi> falſe inference, and yours alſo in concurring with him therein; I deſire the Reader to take into his conſideration theſe two things. 1. Of what kinde of Women the Canon ſpeakes of. 2. What the Gloſſator mentioned by you ſpeakes in the ſame gloſſe of Infants baptized in their Infancy.

Yet I beſeech you tell me, doth he not therein intimate that it was the cuſtome of the Church in his age to baptize the one as well as the other? otherwiſe I ſee no reaſon why he ſhould deſire that they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the one as well as the other. And what's the reaſon of his delay? ſuch as did undertake or promiſe for children were in danger; whilſt they promiſed on their behalf, that which by reaſon of their own mortality, and increaſe of evill diſpoſition in children, afterwards might make them breake, or deſtroy their promiſe; his words are theſe, <q>

                  </q> Is it not evident by that place, that Baptiſme was adminiſtred in all ages, even to little ones; and that there were ſome who undertooke that they ſhould
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113537:22"/>
perform the promiſes made by them on their behalf? onely this cuſtome of baptizing them did not very well pleaſe <hi>Tertullian:</hi> wherefore he ſeeks to diſſwade from it, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pleads againſt it as an unlawfull thing, or an abuſe of Chriſts inſtitution, as you doe; yet how diſpleaſing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of that nature was to others (famous in the Church) hath been cleared by ſeverall teſtimonies before: here may you take notice of one, even before <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the Latine Church, that beares witneſſe againſt you, that in his time children were baptized.

               <p>But before wee part with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> give mee leave to aske the queſtion, whether the diſſwaſion which you cite out of <hi>Tertullians</hi> booke <hi>de Baptiſmo,</hi> may not reaſonably bee interpreted of the Infants of Infidells? becauſe in that Chapter <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeakes of the baptiſme of ſuch as were not born of Chriſtian Parents, (ſuch as the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and <hi>St. Paul;)</hi> and therefore hee deſires that the Baptiſme of ſuch Infants ſhould bee deferred, till they came to yeares, and were able to make confeſſion of their ſinnes, and profeſſion of their faith, their Parents being Infidels, and their Sponſors mortall; for what (ſaith hee) though theſe Infants may have ſome Sponſors to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for their Chriſtian education? yet their Sponſors may die before they are capable of inſtruction; and then that promiſe is void and of none effect.</p>
               <p>And I am very much inclined to beleeve, that this is the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113537:22"/>
true meaning of the place, becauſe it is cleare and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the 39. Chapter of his book <hi>de Anima,</hi> that <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> did acknowledge that the children of beleevers had a <hi>kinde of priviledge (which he calls prerogative) by their birth,</hi> beſides that of their education: and therefore in caſe the Sponſors who undertook for the education of the Infants of Pagans did live, yea, and give thoſe Infants due educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet there was a great difference between them and the Infants of beleevers, who had ſuch a birth priviledge as gave them right to Baptiſme; and by Baptiſme, and the Spirit, ſaith he, they are made (what they were by God deſigned to be) holy indeed.

                  <hi>ſpring-head of Infant-Baptiſme.</hi> It ſeemes when you caſt your lead into the ſea of Antiquity to finde out the depth of this ordinance, your line was too ſhort, and your plummet too light, that it could not reach beyond this Epiſtle: are there not divers inſtances among the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents which make it manifeſt, that before that time Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme was in uſe, as hath been manifeſted to you alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? therefore that was not the firſt time in which it ſprung up in the world.</p>
               <p>You ſay further, <hi>I am miſtaken about the proofes of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which you call not reaſons or proofes, but anſwers to obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> I will not wrangle with you about words, call them what you pleaſe, Arguments or Anſwers: this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to me, what I have produced is recorded in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle: and all of them doe juſtifie the lawfulneſſe of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Infants, which was the thing which I went about to cleare: neither doth any of them enforce Baptiſme to be tyed up to the eighth day, as <hi>Fidus</hi> thought.</p>
               <p>From the words of that Epiſtle, you alledge 3 things; 1. <hi>They thought baptizing, giving Gods grace, denying it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Gods grace.</hi> 2. <hi>They thought the ſoules to bee loſt, which were not baptized.</hi> 3. <hi>That all Infants (not beleevers onely) were to bee baptized.</hi> The 2 firſt I grant are rightly colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the words of the Epiſtle; you might, if you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, have collected divers other things, as that Baptiſme comes in ſtead of Circumciſion, &amp;c. But ſuppoſe all their grounds which they plead be not to be juſtified: yet they doe not darken the light which the place gives to our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. If a man were to make good any aſſertion of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truth, and uſe ſeverall arguments to make it out; if one of theſe arguments be not good, or be weake, that may bee rejected, and yet the truth ſtand firme, ſeeing the other arguments are good and ſtrong to evidence the truth. It is true, when the Ancients ſaid that Children were to be baptized, ſometimes they ſtood peremptorily for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Baptiſme, as if without it no ſalvation were to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113537:24"/>
be excepted; yet they made it out by other Arguments then that: why ſhould then the truth juſtified and cleared up by them, be rejected for this? When they were to prove that men of yeares inſtructed in the truth, ſhould receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, they made that good by ſeveral Reaſons; as ſometimes from the neceſſity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which Jeſus Chriſt laid upon all the Diſciples of the Goſpel, <hi>that they might remember his death till his coming again.</hi> At other times they urged it, leſt men ſhould brand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with unthankfulneſſe in not comming to the feaſt when they are invited. Sometimes again they preſt the ſame duty upon the people to come to that ordinance, that they might have the inward Grace ſignified and exhibted in the Sacrament, to bee ſealed up and confirmed to them. Theſe three wayes did they uſe to preſſe their Hearers to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent receiving of the Sacrament: yet at ſome other times alſo they pleaded the neceſſity of that Sacrament, as if no man without the uſe thereof could be ſaved. No man can deny the firſt three Arguments to be good, though the laſt is not: and notwithſtanding the weakneſſe thereof, this is a ſure truth, <hi>That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is to be received.</hi> So it is here, divers Arguments are brought to prove that children are to bee baptized; and amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, this is one, They conceived the want of it might bee prejudiciall to the ſalvation of Infants, which I will not juſtifie; yet I dare not reject the truth made out by other <hi>media,</hi> reaſons or arguments. And it is to bee remembred that this Argument was moſt frequently uſed by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in the heate of diſputation, when they had to do with them that denyed the traduction of originall ſin from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to Infants: howſoever, at ſome other times they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe with <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that ſome doe receive <hi>rem Baptiſmi</hi>

he ſays ought to bee underſtood of the Church, becauſe he ſpeaks of ſuch as God hath cleanſed or purified, who were common.</p>
               <p>You conſtrue ſome paſſages of the Epiſtle as anſwers to ſome objections, which doe no wayes weaken, but ſtrengthen what I have ſaid from thence. Onely in the cloſure of this Section, you would find fault with my gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of <hi>Cyprians</hi> mind, as if hee had meant <hi>that Infants are to bee baptized, becauſe they are under Originall ſinne, and need pardon.</hi> You ſay the Argument is rather, <hi>that they have leſſer ſinnes then others; and therefore there is leſſer hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to them to come to this Grace, remiſſion of ſinne, and Baptiſme. Cyprian</hi> indeed ſayes, if Baptiſme be not denied to men of yeares, who hath committed more hainous ſins then Infants, why ſhould Baptiſm be denyed to Infants, who are onely guilty of Originall ſin derived to them from <hi>Adam:</hi> doth hee not there mention Originall ſinne, which he ſayes is remitted to Children when they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: which in his judgement is leſſe then the grievous actuall ſins of men of years, added to their Originall ſin.</p>
               <p>In the farewell of your cenſure of <hi>Cyprians</hi> judgement, <hi>you call it naked,</hi> and ſay, <hi>you would have covered the nakedneſſe thereof, but that the truth ſuffered ſo much thereby:</hi> and ſo can at your pleaſure put upon it the title of an <hi>abſurd Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</hi>

               <p>It hath been an ancient juſtifiable courſe in the Church in examining of controverſies in Religion, to look back upon the writings of famous men who flouriſhed in the Church before: was not <hi>Siſinnius</hi> his counſell to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which he preſented to <hi>Theodoſius</hi> (then ſtudying how to put an end to the unhappy differences w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> troubled the Church in his time) when hee perſwaded him, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Firſt, that it was univerſally uſed in the Church, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of good Witneſſes recording the practiſe of the Church make it manifeſt; and wee have heard of ſome of them before in their ſeverall ages; as, <hi>Irenaus lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap:</hi> 39.

And we know that in his time Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was adminiſtred to Infants; therefore in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what the Church did therein, they had authority for it from the Goſpel and the Apoſtles: to make that good, he ſays afterwards, <hi>That Baptiſme came in ſtead of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which then was not in uſe.</hi>
               </p>

Indeed there was a different cuſtome (eſpecially in ſome after ages) in the manner of baptizing both Infants and grown men; in ſome places they dipt them thrice, in ſome but once: and of this very cuſtome <hi>Gregory</hi> the great meanes, when he ſaith, <hi>In una ſide nil officit eccleſiae diverſa</hi>

               <p>Afterwards becauſe you feare theſe inſtances will not bee ſufficient to make good your anſwer, therefore you grant with <hi>Grotius, that Paedo-baptiſme was much more frequented, and with greater opinion of neceſſitie in Africa, then in Aſia, or other parts of the world:</hi> I take what you grant, that it was uſed both in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia:</hi> and may I not then with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſay it was univerſall, both among Greekes and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines?</p>

               <p>In your ſecond Section you except againſt <hi>Auguſtine</hi> his judgement, becauſe <hi>he held that Infants without baptiſme muſt</hi>

                  <hi>bee damned by reaſon of originall ſinne, which is not taken away but by baptiſme.</hi> I grant that <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and ſome others of the Ancients preſſed baptizing of Infants upon that ground, but not onely upon that ground: and they did moſt preſſe that ground when they had to doe with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, denying originall ſinne to be conveighed from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to their children: yet they maintained Paedo-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme upon other ſound grounds, as formerly I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; therefore this exception is of no vilidity, nor was this <hi>Auguſtines</hi> conſtant Doctrine: yea it was a Doctrine which hee retracted as an errour, as ſhall afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>Againe you ſay, that <hi>you cannot finde among the Ancients the ground that I goe upon: that the Covenant of grace belongs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers and their ſeede.</hi> What if you have not found it, will you therefore ſay it is not to be found in their writings? <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus non vidit omnia:</hi> why may not ſome things in the vaſt monuments of Antiquity paſſe unſeene by you? though you have ſeene much, and thinke that you have ſeene more truth then all the Ancients did, and can cenſure what they ſay at your pleaſure: But if you did find this in the writings of the Antients, it would make nothing for, or againſt me, who have not placed Infant-baptiſme upon that ground, becauſe they placed it ſo: I have aſſerted that ground from the Scripture, as afterwards, God willing, ſhall bee made good. But that they alſo, (even many of the ancients) preſſed Baptiſme upon the ſound grounds which wee doe, I have made it appeare out of ſeverall writings.</p>
               <p>As for the judgement of <hi>Bellarmine, Aquinas</hi> and others quoted by you, I will not trouble my ſelfe in anſwering for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:113537:30"/>
them: they were not alledged by me, neither will I ſtand to their judgement.</p>
               <p>In your third Section you bid mee conſider of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> his judgement, <hi>holding it neceſſary for Infants to receive the Lords Supper:</hi> that opinion is nothing to our queſtion in debate before us, therefore you can expect no anſwer from mee to it, for I never pleaded it.</p>
               <p>But what is your Argument from hence, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> held it fit to give Infants the Lords Supper, <hi>Ergo,</hi> What? draw a concluſion to hurt me if you can, our queſtion being whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Infants were baptized in his dayes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly you tell me that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> held a certainety of <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Regeneration by Baptiſme, and he makes no queſtion of the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Infants, &amp;c.</hi> I confeſſe that ſometimes hee ſayes ſo, yet at other times (as I told you before) hee ſayes there are ſome <hi>qui rem baptiſmi abſque Sacramento baptiſmi conſequentur.</hi> So alſo did <hi>Ambroſe</hi> comforting <hi>Valentinian</hi> his ſiſters upon his death (for hee died whilſt <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was on his journey comming to Baptize him) where he ſaid of him, <hi>Quem in Evangelio geniturus eram, amiſi: ſed ille non amiſit gratiam quam popoſcit—vita jam fruitur aeterna—qui ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit ſpeculum tuum Sancte p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fiftly, you ſcorne his judgement in defending queſtions put to Infants at their Baptiſme, and anſwerd by others. That's enough to me to prove that Infants were then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, though I will not take upon me to juſtifie that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of putting forth queſtions to them, who by reaſon of their age were not able to returne an anſwer: poſſibly I could tell you how, and that many other cuſtomes crept into the Church, but becauſe it is not to our purpoſe, I forbeare.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, you ſay, it is apparent out of that Epiſtle of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, That Infants, whether borne of Beleevers, or of ſuch as had not received the Chriſtian faith, were baptized,</hi> neither doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113537:30"/>
you confeſſe the queſtion that Infants were baptized.</p>
               <p>But becauſe you make ſuch a great matter of it that <hi>it muſt needs follow that they rejected covenant-holineſſe or the birth-priviledge of beleevers Infants, becauſe they baptized other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants if brought unto them;</hi> I reply that you cannot bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that many learned men deny this conſequence, becauſe they conceive that not onely ſuch as are borne of Chriſtian parents might bee baptized, but that other Infants alſo if any Chriſtian would undertake to traine them up in Chriſts Schoole might bee admitted into it by Baptiſme; you know many of the reformed Divines thinke this law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, who yet plead covenant-holineſſe, as further warrant why beleevers children not onely may, but ought to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: and <hi>Tertullian</hi> pleads both theſe grounds in the place I quoted at large, both prerogative of birth, and benefit of education. Furthermore many of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines ſay, that the children of Gentiles might bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed if a Jew would bring him up in Religion, yet they all hold a birth-priviledge of Jewes children, for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; I alledge all this to ſhew that you ſhould not thus vilifie and ſcorne their practiſe and grounds without a more cleare refutation of them then yet you have made: whether that which hath beene ſpoken out of <hi>Cyprians</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, and <hi>Auguſtines</hi> approbation of it, doe not advantage my cauſe, whether they have not proved as much as I alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them for, I leave to the judicious and impartiall Reader.</p>
               <p>To all the forenamed Authors I added <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> his teſtimonies to prove the ſame: here you confeſſe that they were of the ſame judgement with <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in our queſtion, therefore <hi>you conceive your anſwer to Auguſtine his teſtimony to be a ſufficient anſwer to them alſo:</hi> in like manner I referre you to my reply to your former anſwer.</p>
               <p>Your laſt Section of this Chapter is a Recollection of what you have already alleadged both for the invalidating of the teſtimonies brought by me to prove the practiſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſme, as alſo of what you have brought to induce an opinion that there was no ſuch thing practiſed in the firſt and beſt Antiquity. You muſt give me leave to recollect
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113537:31"/>
what I have already anſwered to theſe exceptions and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; as for your <hi>Vives</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> I ſhall give you my thoughts of them anon.</p>
               <p>You confeſſe I brought <hi>theſe teſtimonies onely to prove the practiſe of Infant-Baptiſme,</hi> and that you cannot deny they prove, onely <hi>you adde they rather prove the thing an errour then a truth, becauſe practiſed upon ſuch erroneous grounds. As the neceſſitie of Baptiſme to ſalvation: The certaintie of the Remiſſion of originall ſinne: The denying of Baptiſme unto none.</hi> But are theſe the onely proofes by which the Ancients did aſſert the baptizing of Infants; I have proved, that notwithſtanding ſome of them owned that corrupt ground (and pleaded it eſpecially in the heate of diſputation) yet they baptized them upon the ſame grounds which we doe. Doe not <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Cyprian, &amp;c.</hi> argue from Circumciſion unto Baptiſme as wee now doe, and others of them from Covenant-holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? (but this and our other proofes you threaten to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hereafter.)</p>
               <p>In the meane <hi>time this you adde,</hi> (you ſhould have ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate) for you adde nothing to what you had ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Teſtimonies produced prove not that it was in practiſe, but in caſe of ſuppoſed neceſſitie.</hi> Let the Reader judge whether theſe Teſtimonies have not proved it an univerſall practiſe, and ſo not onely in caſe of ſuppoſed neceſſitie; and let Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> but conſult that Booke, which I perceive hee hath made great uſe of in this Controverſie, an Arminian Book commonly known by the name of <hi>Cenſurae Cenſurae,</hi> and that will tell him that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> may bee ſaid to bee the firſt that grounded Infant-baptiſme upon neceſſitie, <hi>Cen. Cen. cap.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you ſay <hi>there was ſtill in practiſe a conſtant courſe of baptizing the growne children of profeſſed beleevers when they were at full age:</hi> you have ſeene already how much you are miſtaken in thoſe inſtances you give of ſuch a practiſe, and how much this practiſe was diſavowed by the Fathers of thoſe times, could you but finde as much in Antiquitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the baptizing of Infants as there is againſt the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:113537:31"/>
deferring Baptiſme, how would you triumph?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you ſay <hi>they did conceive a like neceſſitie of, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did practiſe the giving of the Lords Supper to Infants.</hi> But did all the Fathers fore-mentioned judge and practiſe ſo? you cannot but know that all that plead for them doe not plead for the other, nor can you ſhow that all that practiſed the one practiſed the other; I confeſſe ſome of the Africans did ſo.</p>
               <p>Your fourth, <hi>that they made no difference betweene the Infants of beleevers and unbeleevers brought unto them,</hi> if it were true, doth not diſprove the practiſe of Baptizing Infants, onely it proves an errour in that practiſe. But (if by unbeleevers you meane Pagans) it is not proved to bee their generall practiſe, I thinke it was practiſed by ſome of them upon the grounds above mentioned, but not found in their conſtant and generall practiſe.</p>
               <p>In your fifth you ſpeake cautelouſly that <hi>the Ancienteſt of Teſtimonies for practiſe [according to any Rule determined] is Cyprian neere</hi> 300. <hi>yeers after Chriſt.</hi> Here I muſt needs take notice of your <hi>overlaſhing,</hi> who before calculating his age acknowledged him to live but 250. yeers, and here you ſay hee lived almoſt 300. yeers. I ſee that the Teſtimonies of <hi>Iuſtine Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen, Tertullian,</hi> (who all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved neerer the times of Chriſt then <hi>Cyprian)</hi> are made good againſt your exceptions; you finde onely this evaſion, that their Teſtimonies doe not prove the practiſe of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, <hi>according to any Rule determined.</hi> But Sir remember our controverſie at preſent is concerning the practiſe, not the Rule.</p>
               <p>In the next place you undertake to prove that it <hi>was not ſo from the beginning,</hi> and that by many evidences. Now I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conceive it likely, that <hi>Auguſtines Eccleſia ſemper habu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, ſemper tenuit,</hi> ſhould ſway as much with the intelligent impartiall Reader, as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his <hi>Non ſemper habuit, non ſemper tenuit;</hi> eſpecially conſidering that you bring not in all the Antiquitie you have produced <hi>one man that doth either deny the Baptizing of Infants to have beene the ordinary practiſe of the Church or that condemne it,</hi> onely two you cite that doe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113537:32"/>
adviſe the deferring of it, as they doe alſo the Baptiſme of growne men.</p>
               <p>As firſt, <hi>the propounding of queſtions unto Infants, which as</hi> Strabo <hi>and</hi> Vives <hi>did, ſo any reaſonable man ſay you will thinke a manifeſt proofe that at firſt none were baptized but ſuch as underſtood the ſaith of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſuppoſeth theſe queſtions to bee of as Antient uſe in the Church of God as Baptiſme it ſelfe, which certainly you can never prove from Scripture, and how can any reaſonable man thinke that a manifeſt proofe to whom Baptiſme was, or was not at firſt adminiſtred, that was not in uſe in the firſt adminiſtration. I have produced teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies bearing witneſſe to the baptizing of children, which plead for it, before you can bring any to witneſſe that thoſe formes of queſtions and anſwers, had any being in the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>your examples of Greg. Naz. Chryſoſt. Auguſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine the Great,</hi> have been already anſwered. Your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in their parents, education, reaſons of their deferring Baptiſme, ſo made manifeſt, as it is abundantly evident they are farre from proving the Baptizing of Infants of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an parents not to have been the received and conſtant practiſe of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Greg. Nazianzen and Tertullian whom you cite as diſſwading;</hi> you have heard even in the places cited to you, the one bearing witneſſe to the practiſe of Infant-baptiſme, the other commanding it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>the Teſtimony of the Councell of Neocaeſaerea which you ſay is plaine againſt it;</hi> of the teſtimony of this Councell, let the Reader looke backe and judge, but the gloſſe upon that Canon to which you referred us, I am ſure is a plaine Teſtimony for it.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>the ſilence which you impute to the chiefe writers, Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, &amp;c.</hi> is your miſtake, not their fault; for <hi>Euſebius,</hi> what the reaſon of his ſilence is you have heard; and for your, &amp;c. if you meane <hi>Tertullian, Athanaſius, Epiphanius,</hi> whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you charged with ſilence in this cauſe, I hope you may now heare them ſpeaking and witneſſing for us.</p>

Sixtly, for the many <hi>paſſages in Auſtine and others that call it an Apoſtolicall Tradition,</hi> in what ſenſe they are to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood I have already ſhewed, and am loath to detaine the Reader with Tautologies.</p>
               <p>For your <hi>Triumviri</hi> that bring up your reere and ſhut up this firſt part of your Battalia, <hi>Grotius, Vives,</hi> and <hi>Strabo.</hi> (to whom I wonder you did not adde <hi>Cenſura Cenſurae,</hi> for you are more beholden to them for your Teſtimonies of <note place="margin">Chapter 23.</note> Antiquity, ſuch as they bee, then to all your other three, and I dare ſay, without diſparagement to your reading, whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lookes in <hi>Grotius</hi> and them, ſhall find almoſt all that you have ſpoken in this Controverſie from Antiquity collected to your hand.) One of your three Champions I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred, and I hope diſpatched already; and for the other two <hi>Vives</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> I ſee they are men of great account with you. <hi>Vives</hi> you quote five or ſix times, and adorne your Frontiſpice with a peece of his, and <hi>Strabo</hi> you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion often. But I beſeech you Sir, muſt wee take the bare word of <hi>Vives</hi> a man of yeſterday, or of a <hi>Strabo</hi> in matters of fact in things done ſo many hundred yeers before they were borne, and that againſt the expreſſe witneſſe of ſo many worthy and learned men who lived in thoſe times? what evidence doe either of them produce out of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to make their aſſertion good? You know well enough that learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> did take notice of <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Vives,</hi> and proves out of Authors that lived many hundred yeers before <hi>Strabo</hi> (for hee lived but about 850) that Infants were baptized in the Church of old, and wonders that <hi>Strabo</hi> ſhould rely upon ſo weake an argument as hee doth; and I as much wonder that you knowing all this ſhould boaſt ſo much of ſuch broken Reeds. And ſo I leave you and your men, and ſhall expect to ſee what reliefe you will bee able to give them, for they can give none to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>More Teſtimonies you ſay you could have added out of ſundry Authors:</hi> which I hardly beleeve ſeeing you are forced to <hi>rake up an old uſe continued in ſome Cities of Italy</hi> onely upon the heareſay of <hi>Vives.</hi> But theſe you ſay are enough to you, and you thinke to any that ſearch into antiquity, to prove
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:113537:33"/>
that the cuſtome of Baptizing of Infants was not from the beginning, and therefore is but an innovation, I verily beleeve upon your next ſearch into Antiquitie, you will be of another mind.</p>
               <p>And for your confident aſſertion <hi>that the Doctrine that Baptiſme is to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> given to Infants of Beleevers onely becauſe of Covenant-holineſſe, is not elder then Zuinglius: Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi> I confeſſe was a great Patron of this cauſe, who in a publike diſpute did ſo convince and ſtop the mouths of the Anabaptiſts, that they appearing to the Magiſtrates unreaſonably obſtinate were baniſhed the Citie. But whereas you ſay hee is the firſt that you can finde that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Baptiſme of Infants upon this ground; I ſhall be glad to helpe you; peruſe but what is before your eyes, and you ſhall find <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> pleading the right of Infants to the Kingdome of heaven upon Covenant ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe: you may finde <hi>Epiphanius, Cyprian, Nazianzen, Auguſtine, Chryſoſtome,</hi> and others pleading Baptiſme to come in the roome of Circumciſion, and divers of them pleading Infants right to Baptiſme from the Jewes Infants right to Circumciſion, which to mee is all one as to plead it from Covenant-holineſſe: you may alſo finde even the Pelagians acknowledging a Divine Inſtitution for it, <hi>ſecundum ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam Evangelii.</hi> And now I hope it will not offend you if I ſay, I am ſorry you diſcover ſo much either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or negligence in the ſearch of Antiquity, as to ſay, The Tenet and Practiſe of Infant-baptiſme accordingly as wee hold and practiſe, is not much above 100. yeers old, ſo farre as you can find.</p>
               <p>To conclude this part of my Treatiſe about the Antiquity of Infant-Baptiſme, give me leave to adde theſe few things. Firſt, that I ſhould not have judged it convenient to have made ſo much ſearch into the practiſe of antiquity, if you had not ſo confidently undertaken to ſhew that the ancients were of your mind, and that I perceive your faire ſhowes make many begin to thinke it was as you affirme, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking my ſelfe bound to give the beſt account I could with truth, I have not onely made what diligent ſearch I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:113537:33"/>
could my ſelf, but have alſo (which I willingly acknowledge that no man may thinke of my reading above what it is) made uſe of my friend who is better verſed in their writings then I am, leſt the truth in this matter of practiſe might ſuffer through my weakneſſe, who have but juſt leaſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to looke into theſe Authors now and then, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult them upon occaſion. Yet had it been needfull, I could have added many other teſtimonies out of the Antients to let you ſee that they approved Infant-Baptiſme, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Baptiſme came in the place of Circumciſion, as the Author of the Booke <hi>De Vocatione Gentium, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7 <hi>Cyrill. Alexandrin. in Levis. lib. Iſychius Presbyter in Levit. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. and many more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in this ſearch I find that the Ancients did not thinke that all who died unbaptized were damned, as you uſually charge them.</p>
               <p>They conceived that Martyrs were baptized with their blood, and therefore might bee ſaved though they were not baptized with water. When great <hi>Baſil</hi> diſcourſed of this point in his Homily of the 40. Martyrs, he ſaith of one <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>He was baptized not by another (or the ſaith of another) but by his owne faith: not in water, butin his owne blood.</hi> Here Baptiſme by water was denyed, and yet ſalvation attained by a two fold Baptiſme, by faith, and in blood.</p>
               <p>Yea I alſo obſerve that they who were no Martyrs, were in the judgement of the Ancients ſufficiently baptized by the holy Ghoſt, without blood or water: and for proofe of this point, I ſhall produce a teſtimony out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> whom I cite the rather, becauſe upon ſecond thoughts hee did retract his opinion, and acknowledge that Baptiſme was not Abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, Martyrdome might ſuffice without Baptiſme, nay faith and converſion of the heart might ſuffice without Martyrdome, or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, in caſe a man were caſt into ſuch ſtraights, that hee could not be made partaker of Baptiſme; <hi>Etiam atque etiam conſiderans inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nio</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>non tantum paſſionem pro nomine
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:113537:34"/>
Chriſti, id quod ex Baptiſmo deerat, poſſe ſupplere, ſed etiam fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem converſionemque cordis, ſi forte ad celebrandum Myſterium Baptiſmi in anguſtiis temporum ſuccurri non poteſt,</hi> in his fift booke <hi>De Baptiſmo contra Donatiſtas;</hi> obſerve that hee ſaith, <hi>etiam atque etiam conſiderans, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore I told you this was his judgement upon ſecond thoughts, and more mature deliberation.</p>
               <p>And when this point came to be debated in after ages, the Church tooke notice of this Retractation, <hi>Bernard</hi> diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon this ſubject at large in his 77. Epiſtle, and proves clearely out of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> that inviſible ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was ſufficient to ſalvation without a participation of the viſible Sacrament. <hi>Inviſibilem ſanctificationem qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſdam affuiſſe, &amp; profuiſſe ſine viſibilibus Sacramentis—Solam interdum fidem ſufficere ad ſalutem, et ſine ipſâ ſufficere nihil, &amp;c. Faith alone</hi> ſaith hee, (that is, faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Martyrdome) <hi>is ſufficient to ſalvation, and nothing but ſaith: for though Martyrdome,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi> there, <hi>may ſupply the defect of Baptiſme, wee muſt not conceive that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſuffering prevailes, but the faith of him that ſuffers. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiet ſpiritus ſolus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bleſenſis,</hi> one that's as ancient as <hi>Bernard,</hi> more ancient then your <hi>Walafridus Strabo) quia ipſius teſtimonium pondus habet.</hi> It is alſo cleare and evident, that after this opinion prevailed, Infant-Baptiſme was not rejected, and therefore you are extreamely miſtaken in this point. Now if (in the opinion of the ancients) men of growne yeers might bee ſaved without Baptiſme, if they were either converts, or Martyrs, why may not elect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants who are certainly ſanctified, bee made happy without Baptiſme, when they have been made holy by the ſpirit of holineſſe? could any of the ancients reaſonably grant the one, and deny the other?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you may ſee that in pleading for this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall practiſe I ſpeake no louder then other Reformed Divines, for the antiquity of Infant-Baptiſme. Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Calvin</hi> who was well verſed in Antiquitie, in his inſtruction againſt the Anabaptiſts hath theſe words; <hi>I affirme that this holy Ordinance of Infant-Baptiſme hath
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113537:34"/>
been perpetually obſerved in the Chriſtian Church, for there is no ancient Doctor, that doth not acknowledge that Infant-Baptiſme was conſtantly adminiſtred by the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That notwithſtanding all this evidence I have brought from Antiquity, yet I build as little upon Antiquitie as any other man. I acknowledge what learned <hi>Rivet</hi> ſaith to be very true, <hi>that Tradition is in moſt points uncertaine, and therefore he that will build ſure muſt build upon the Scripture: Proinde neceſſario veniendum erat ad argumenta ex Scripturis; quae ſi rem non evincant, fruſtra traditionem advocabimus. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madv. in Annot. Grotii in Caſſandrum, Art.</hi> 9. <hi>Pag.</hi> 71. And I would have you and every Reader to remember, that I doe not build my faith upon humane Traditions in this Argument, nor did the ancients build upon humane tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this thing: the very Pelagians themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it upon this ground. <hi>Parvulos baptizandos eſſe conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of the Pelagians) <hi>qui contra authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem univerſae Eccleſiae procul-dubio per Dominum et Apoſtolos traditam, venire non poſſunt, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de peccat. merit. et Remiſſ. cap.</hi> 26. Nay, they were forced to their owne prejudice to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that Infants were baptized <hi>ſecundum regulam uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalis Eccleſiae &amp; Evangelii ſententiam, lib. cont. Caeleſt. &amp; Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag.</hi> Now that which was preſſed from the ſcope of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was not preſſed as a Tradition, and that which was acknowledged by the Pelagians to be the practiſe of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church, according to the rule of the Goſpell, was not built upon tradition. I will therefore cloſe up my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies produced out of the ancient writers, with that ſavoury paſſage of learned <hi>Calvin,</hi> in his Inſtructions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Anabaptiſts; <hi>Caeterum minime peto, ut in eo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bando nos Antiquit<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, Baptiſme is primarily and properly the Sacrament of our new birth, the waſhing of regeneration, which is done but once, the Sacrament of our inſition into Chriſt, which is done but once; the Sacrament of our admiſſion into the new Covenant, and partaking of the benefits of it, and (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many of thoſe benefits and priviledges are repeated and augmented, yet) we have but one admiſſion to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in no place where the Inſtitution of it is named is there any mention, directly or by conſequence, of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating of it, nor any order taken about it; whereas in the other Sacrament, we have a <hi>quotieſcunque</hi> in the very Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: nor in any of the thouſands baptized in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is there the leaſt hint of any example of rebaptization of ſuch as were rightly baptized, no not though ſome of them had played the Apoſtates, as the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and many others. And mee thinks this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould move <hi>you</hi> whoſe principle is, that <hi>nothing</hi> ſhould be done about the Sacraments, but what wee have either inſtitution, or example for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Baptiſme ſucceeds Circumciſion, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was but once adminiſtred nor to be adminiſtred any more, as is cleare to mee not onely from the <hi>totall ſilence of the Scripture,</hi> but out of <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. 4. &amp;c. where the holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to give this as a reaſon, why <hi>Joſhuah</hi> Circumciſed the Iſraelites in <hi>Gilgall, viz. becauſe all the Circumciſed were dead;</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that had they been Circumciſed already, it ſhould not have been done againe. Beſide, by Gods inſtitution it was tied to the eighth day and unleſſe you can find another eighth day after the birth beſide the firſt, you will never bee able to juſtifie it from being a breach of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to this I might adde the uncontradicted cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of all the ancient Church, with whom it was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among Hereſies to reiterate a Baptiſme, which was acknowledged to be valid: Indeed <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his fellow

               <p>But whereas you adde <q>
                     <hi>that if you ſaw but as much for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants as</hi> Acts 19. 5. <hi>&amp;c. affords for rebaptization, the controverſie were at an end with you;</hi>
                  </q> give me leave to tell <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> you that I perceive a ſmall Argument would ſatisfie you if wee could but once gaine your good will. As will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by a ſerious examination of the ſenſe of that place, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. which it ſeemes ſatisfies you for rebaptization. I <note place="margin">Act. 19. 5, 6. vindicated from favoring rebaptiztion.</note> acknowledge, Interpreters differ very much concerning the meaning of that Text, but none of their expoſitions doe in any degree favour that opinion, that ſuch as were once <hi>rightly</hi> baptized may be rebaptized: which I thus manifeſt; very many Interpreters doe judge that thoſe twelve Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were not baptized in that place, and they make the fifth Verſe, <hi>when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> to bee a part of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeech, not of <hi>Lukes</hi> the Hiſtorian, and then the ſenſe is this, when thoſe twelve men had told <hi>Paul</hi> that they were baptized with <hi>Johns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Voſſii The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes de Baptiſmo Johan. pag</hi> 402. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> tooke upon him to explaine to them what <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme was, namely that <hi>Johns</hi> miniſtry did firſt exhort men to repentance; and then that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt, who would give all them who beleeved in him the gift of the holy Ghoſt, which after <hi>John</hi> had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inſtructed them in, he then baptized them in the name of the Lord Jeſus, which ſay they is a paraphraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call interpretation of this fifth Verſe: and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> having approved the doctrine and Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> which theſe twelve Diſciples had received, hee did not rebaptize them, but laid his hands upon them, and then the holy Ghoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly came upon them. Other Interpreters thinke, that theſe words in the fift Verſ. are the words of <hi>Luke</hi> the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and that theſe twelve Diſciples were then baptized af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Paul</hi> had done his ſpeech; and of theſe ſome conceive that theſe were firſt baptized by ſome of <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples into <hi>Iohns</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:113537:39"/>
name, and not into Chriſts: and ſo their baptiſm was a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; or at leaſt, if they were baptized into Chriſts name, yet they were not inſtructed in the right faith of the Trinity, of Jeſus Chriſt, his perſon, gifts; and offices; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that their faith and Baptiſme were deficient in ſome fundamentall and eſſentiall things; and this way go many of the Fathers, and Schoolemen. Others thinke they were rightly baptized with <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſme, and yet were baptized againe by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi> becauſe they think that <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſme, and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s did really differ; and that the Lord would have them re baptized, who were baptized with <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſme onely; but not them who were baptized with Chriſts. And this way generally goe the Papiſts: now whichſoever of theſe you take, here is no colour of rebaptizing of ſuch who were rightly baptized with Chriſts baptiſme: and indeed, whoever conſiders the Text, muſt needs grant that if they were re-baptized, it was becauſe of the deficiency of the baptiſm which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved. <hi>Paul</hi> demands of them, Have you received the holy Ghoſt ſince you were baptized? They anſw. The holy Ghoſt: what meane you by the holy Ghoſt? wee never ſo much as heard whether there be an holy Ghoſt: No? (ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> what were you then baptized into? what ſtrange kind of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme have you received? what Doctrine, or Faith were you inſtructed in before your baptiſme? if you never ſo much as heard that there is an holy Ghoſt. Doth not this plainly hold forth, that if they were re-baptized, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> thought their former baptiſm to be inſufficient? Truly Sir, I conceive you might eaſily be perſwaded, that there are at leaſt as good grounds for Infants baptiſme, as this <hi>Acts</hi> 19. affords for re-baptizing of ſuch as have been rightly baptized.</p>
               <p>

ſuch things happen, when Reformation of abuſes is denyed men by an orderly Synodicall way; and the perſons who ſeeke it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed againſt, and perſecuted as Heretiques, &amp;c.</hi> 3. <hi>That the like things, if not the ſame, happened among the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, and ſuch as ſought to remove Epiſcopacy and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in Queene</hi> Elizabeths <hi>dayes; that ſome of them grew to bee a dangerous and turbulent Sect: the practiſe of</hi> Hacket, <hi>and his companions proved like that of</hi> John <hi>a</hi> Leiden <hi>at</hi> Munſter. <hi>That miſcarriages, diviſions, and perſecutions brought the Non-conformiſts of England as low as the Anabaptiſts.

And I think you are the firſt of our Divines who have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected them to overlaſh in their relations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what you meane by denying Reformation to them who ſeek it in a Synodicall way, &amp;c. I can hardly gueſſe: whether you intend it to excuſe the Anabaptiſts in part, and to blame the Reformed Churches, as laying that ſtumbling blocke in their way, by refuſing to heare them, or whether you hint it as a warning to our ſelves. As for them, I never read that they ſought Reformation in a regular way, or were denyed it, before they fell into theſe furies. And as for our ſelves, you are the onely man, who hath pretended to ſeek Reformation (if it may be ſo called) in this point; the reſt of our Anabaptiſts ſeek not <note place="margin">The old Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts in <hi>Qu.

               <p>And laſtly, for what you ſpeake of the Aſſembly, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to your prejudice, and extreame doting upon your owne opinion, that you thinke this <hi>Point</hi> moſt worthy of their examination, and to your <hi>miſinformation</hi> (to ſpeake no worſe) <hi>that they waſte much time about things inconſiderable in compariſon, or that they exclude this from Examination, or ſeeke to ſtop it from any Tryall, or that they haſtily paſſe it over;</hi> This is a very bold charge which you <hi>give upon</hi> the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the face of the world: What evidence have you for this? unleſſe <hi>your Compaſſionate Samaritan</hi> bee Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick with you?

               <p>Nay give me leave to adde, that in this point in queſtion, the advantage lies more on this hand, (I meane for Infant-Baptiſme) becauſe there is more neceſſitie of clearing the Inſtitution for the Lords day, then for baptizing of Infants, becauſe in the one the ordinance it ſelfe, and its inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is queſtioned, but in this of Infant-Baptiſme, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not of the Inſtitution of the <hi>Ordinance it ſelfe,</hi> but onely of <hi>the ſubject</hi> to whom the Ordinance is to be applyed. If the queſtion bee betwixt Baptiſme and the Lords day, all grant that we have clearer Inſtitution for the Sacrament of Baptiſme, then for the Lords day: Baptiſme is clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the New-Teſtament to bee the Sacrament of our admiſſion into the Covenant of grace, and to ſucceed in the roome of Circumciſion, (as your ſelfe grant.) Now the onely queſtion is, whether (taking this for granted) that baptiſm ſucceeds in the roome of Circumciciſion, and to bee applyed unto all perſons by the will of God who are in Covenant with him, whether the ſame perſons may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this Sacrament, as might partake of the other, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thoſe perſons bee expreſly ſet downe in the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I hope in the judgement of all indifferent men, a queſtion about the perſons to whom an ordinance is to bee applyed, is a queſtion of a farre inferiour nature to that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether ſuch a thing pretended to be an Ordinance have any Inſtitution at all or not. It's one thing to invent a new Ordinance of worſhip, another (and that of inferiour rank) to miſtake in ſome of the perſons to whom an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is to be applyed. In ſome of the ancient times the Lords Supper was given to Infants, and carried to ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons when abſent, to teſtifie their communion with the Church: I take them both for errours, but yet not for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the like nature with inventing a new Sacrament; I
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:113537:45"/>
ſay againe, there is a great difference betweene bringing in a new Ordinance, and applying it to theſe or theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, eſpecially, when the queſtion is not of the perſons in generall, who are the ſubject matter, (as whether men or Angels, men or beaſts) but whether men of ſuch an age or of ſuch a Sex. Sir, to my beſt underſtanding, theſe two queſtions are not parallell, a juſt parallell queſtion to this of Infant-Baptiſme would be ſuch a one as was once diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betwixt Mr. <hi>Bifield</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brerewood, viz.</hi> Taking it for granted, that by a cleare Inſtitution, the Lords day ſucceeds in the roome of the old Sabbath, whether yet the ſame perſons are tied to keepe the Lords day, who of old were tied to keepe the Sabbath, unleſſe thoſe parties were mentioned in the New-Teſtament, as whether ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as well as their maſters, the ſame holds here.</p>
               <p>All this I ſpeake not as any whit doubting that there is as cleare evidence for Baptizing of Infants, as there is for the religious obſervation of the Chriſtian Sabbath, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the latter ſeemes to require fuller evidence then this doth.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond explication gives you as little advantage, you ſay <hi>that Apoſtolicall example which hath not a me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re temporary reaſon, is enough to prove an Inſtitution from God, to which that practiſe doth relate, eſpecially when ſuch examples come to bee backed with the conſtant practiſe of all Churches in all ages. And then you bring in Pauls preaching at Troa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sir, I except againſt none of all this to bee a part of that good evidence which wee have for the religious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day, but I dare confidently ſpeake it, that out of theſe you can never evince more (laying all things together) to prove the Inſtitution of the Lords day, then I have done for the lawfulneſſe of baptizing of Infants; and I appeale to all learned Readers, whether the many bookes written of late againſt the Inſtitution of the Lords day, give not as ſpecious and plauſible anſwers to theſe places alledged by you concerning the Chriſtian Sabbath,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113537:45"/>
as yours are againſt Infant-baptiſme (although they have received ſufficient cleare and ſolid anſwers) yea and tread under their feet all arguments taken from theſe examples, with as much confidence and ſcorne, as your ſelfe doe that which I and others have named for Paedo-Baptiſme. And as for the ſupplement which you bring out of the conſtant practiſe of the Churches for the religious obſervation of the Lords day in ſtead of the old Sabbath: I earneſtly deſire you in your next to produce as many of the ancients to beare witneſſe to that truth, as I have done in this point for Paedo-Baptiſme, and I promiſe you, you ſhall receive my hearty thanks among the reſt of your Readers; in the meane time the Reader ſhall judge whether I have not brought a moity of that for the Baptizing of Infants, which you have done for the Lords day.</p>
               <p>Further, whether you have not abuſed your reader in ſo confident averring <hi>that there are no footſteps in Antiquity for Paedo-Baptiſme, till the erroneous conceit of giving Gods grace by it, &amp; the neceſſity of it, to ſave an Infant from periſhing ſome hundreds of yeers after Chriſts Incarnation,</hi> is eaſily to bee ſeene by what I have at large produced in the former part of this treatiſe.</p>

What you add in the end of this Section, that a paſſage in one of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons about <hi>the hedge which God hath ſet about the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement hath been one cauſe of your ſtartling at this point of Paedo-Baptiſme.</hi> I anſwer, onely this, had you not bin ſtartled before, there is nothing in that ſpeech could have moved you; and when once you have manifeſted that Baptizing of Infants doth breake downe the hedge which God hath made about the ſecond Commandement, I ſhall bee ſtartled with you, and not till then.</p>
               <p>In your tenth and laſt Section, wherein you undertake to anſwer that paſſage in my Sermon, that the opinion <note place="margin">

the ſelfeſame condition with Turkes and Infidells, you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſeverall things: wherein I plainely perceive you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny what I affirme, and yet you are loath to grant it: you ſay, firſt, <hi>Cyprian with his</hi> 66. <hi>Biſhops doth the ſame,</hi> which I have forinerly ſhewed will not follow out of the words of of that Epiſtle: ſecondly, you ſay, <hi>Mr. Rathband pleading that ſuch Children whoſe Anceſtors in any generation were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full may lawfully bee accounted within Gods Covenant, grants the ſame alſo.</hi> But this no wayes followes without extreame wracking thoſe words <hi>in any Generation.</hi> I ſuppoſe your ſelfe doth not thinke thoſe words, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5. were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to intimate that all the children in the world, who came from <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Noah</hi> were included in the Covenant of grace, nor doe I conceive you beleeved Mr. <hi>Rathband</hi> to thinke ſo. For your owne opinion you declare it thus; 1. <hi>You know no warrant to thinke election to reach beleevers children more then unbeleevers children.</hi> 2. <hi>You know no more promiſe for them then for the children of unbeleevers.</hi> 3. <hi>All the likelihood there is, that they belong to Gods election rather then Turkes and Infidels, to be, becauſe they have their parents and the Churches prayers, ſome generall and conditionall promiſes, and enjoy the benefit of good inſtruction and example, which puts them into a nearer poſſibility to bee beleevers and ſaved, and experience ſhewes God fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently continues his Church in their poſterity. But this you dare not ground upon any promiſe made unto beleevers as ſuch, for ſtore you ſhould incurre blaſphemy by challenging a promiſe which God doth not keepe: in that many of the poſteritie of godly parents prove very wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which I anſwer, firſt, in generall, that to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding you here clearely yeeld the Infants of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to bee in the ſame condition in reference to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, which the Infants of Turkes and Indians are in, no more promiſe for the one then for the other: which ſo oft as you conſider, mee thinkes your fatherly bowels to your owne children ſhould bee moved within you. Secondly, I anſwer, firſt, to that of election, <hi>your owne ſpeech that experience ſhewing that God frequently continues his Church among beleevers poſteritie,</hi> ſhould be one argument to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113537:47"/>
make you thinke Gods election lies more among them then among others, though wee can bee certaine of no one of them in particular. Secondly, what promiſes are made to beleevers children more then to Turkes, and whether <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> promiſe reach them, ſhall God willing bee ſcand in its proper place. Thirdly, as to that which you ſay, that the children of beleevers are in a more hopefull way, becauſe of their parents prayers, inſtructions, examples, &amp;c. and ſome generall and conditionall promiſes which puts them in a more poſſibilitie; I anſwer, this is nothing to the children which die in their Infancy, nor ſecondly, any more then children of Pagans enjoy, whoſe lot may fall to be educated by Chriſtians, but no more promiſe by your doctrine for the one then the other. Thirdly, whereas you affirme <hi>that Generall, Indefinite, and Conditionall promiſes doe prove that there is a more comfortable likelihood that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of beleevers are elected by God rather then the children of Turkes.</hi> I reply, 1. You doe not expreſſe what thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are. 2. I wonder that you ſhould inferre election from conditionall promiſes. Did God ever ſay that if you will performe theſe and theſe conditions, then I will regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate you, give you a new heart, and put my ſpirit within you? 3. If the promiſe of regeneration bee not conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall then you muſt ſay that there is ſome comfortable likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that ſuch Infants may bee elected though they are not regenerated, for if there be any thing leſſe then regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſed, ſure there can be no comfortable likelihood of the election of a child gathered from a promiſe of any thing which leaves a child in an unregenerate eſtate. But I much admire that ſpeech of yours, where you feare you ſhould incur blaſphemy by challenging a promiſe which God doth not keepe, becauſe many of the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers prove wicked; I beſeech you tell me, was it not ſo among <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie? and yet you grant <hi>Abraham</hi> had a peculiar promiſe which wee have not; might not they without blaſphemy plead that promiſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that promiſe, <hi>I will he the God of thee and thy ſeed,</hi> was not made good to every one of them? for it is moſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:113537:47"/>
cleare by the Apoſtles diſcourſe in the ninth and eleventh Chapters to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that God was not the God of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, either in reſpect of ſaving grace, or outward priviledges, for he caſt off the Jewes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his people, and ſuffered them not to enjoy ſo much as outward priviledges, but made choice of the Gentiles in their ſtead; and yet I hope you will not ſay that God broke his Covenant with thoſe that had the ſeale of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in their fleſh; and yet were rejected not onely from ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, but from outward priviledges.</p>
               <p>Next let us ſee how you avoid being goared by the three hornes of my Syllogiſme. I ſaid, all being left in the ſame condition, 1. <hi>All muſt be ſaved. Or</hi> 2. <hi>all muſt bee damned. Or</hi> 3. <hi>God ſaves ſome of the Infants of the Turkes, and ſome of the Infants of beleevers pro beneplacito.</hi> After ſome diſcourſe of the two firſt of theſe, you deny the conſequence: <hi>It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not</hi> (ſay you) <hi>God may ſave ſome, and thoſe ſome may bee the Infants of beleevers, and none of the Infants of Turks and Indians.</hi> It's true, a man that will may venture to ſay ſo; and if another will, he may venture to ſay, <hi>That thoſe ſome, are the Infants of Pagans, and not of Chriſtians:</hi> and hee that ſhould ſay ſo, hath as good warrant for this, as you have for the other, <hi>according to your principle.</hi> But what's this to the queſtion before us? I ſaid, This <hi>opinion</hi> leaves them all in the like condition; <hi>One having no more reference to a promiſe then another.</hi> Now if you will avoid being goared by any of theſe three hornes, you ſhould have ſhewed, that according to your opinion, there is ſome <hi>promiſe</hi> for ſome of the Infants of beleevers, though there be none for the Infants of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. But in ſtead of ſhewing how your doctrine and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion leaves them: you tell me what God may poſſibly doe in his ſecret Counſell, which is altogether unknowne to us. But I perceive your ſelfe ſuſpected this anſwer would not endure the tryall: and therefore you quarrell at that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of mine, <hi>That if any of the Infants, of ſuch as live and die Pagans be ſaved by Chriſt; then ſalvation by Chriſt is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed out of the Church, whereof God hath made no promiſe.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this you except; 1. <hi>That ſalvation is not carryed out of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:113537:48"/>
the inviſible Church; though ſome Infants of Pagans ſhould bee ſaved by Chriſt.</hi> I anſwer, it's true; and I adde, That if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſhall ſay, <hi>the Devils ſhould be ſaved by Chriſt:</hi> even that Opinion would not carry ſalvation out of the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church. But Sir, we are enquiring after the ſalvation of them to whom a promiſe of ſalvation is made. Now when you can prove that God hath made a promiſe, that he will gather a number, or hath a number whoſe names are written in the Lambs book, although their Parents ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew Jeſus Chriſt, nor themſelves ever live to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, you may then perſwade your Reader to beleeve, that even ſome of the Infants of Pagans dying in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy belong to the inviſible Church: and till then, you muſt give him leave to beleeve that this anſwer is brought in as a ſhift, onely to ſerve your preſent need.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you anſwer, <hi>That men may bee ſaved out of the communion of the viſible Church; and you inſtance</hi> Abraham <hi>called out of</hi> Chaldea; Job <hi>in the Land of</hi> Vz; Rahab <hi>in</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo: <hi>and you ſay, Hee that called theſe, may ſave ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Turkes and Indians out of the viſible Church.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I hope in your next, you will a little better explaine your meaning: The Reader will certainly take this to bee your meaning: that as <hi>Abraham, Job,</hi> and <hi>Rahab,</hi> were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the communion of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> viſible Church in their dayes: ſo ſome among the Turkes and Indians may bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the communion of the viſible Church in our dayes. But ſurely this is not your meaning, you doe not beleeve, that <hi>Abraham, Job,</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> were out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the viſible Church, though poſſibly the manner of their calling might bee extraordinary, as afterwards St. <hi>Pauls</hi> was. Nor doe you beleeve that the Eunuch when he was returned into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was out of the Communion of the viſible Church; though his habitation (at leaſt for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> while) was not among Chriſtians but Infidels. I am perſwaded that you thinke all viſible beleevers to bee within the Communion of the viſible Church, though poſſibly they may be hindered from being actuall Members of any particular Church. I will not ſo much as imagine that you
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:113537:48"/>
mentioned theſe three examples, as a Blinde to deceive your uncautelous Reader: and therefore I only deſire you in your next, to let us know your meaning plainely: and diſcover to us this myſtery, how men may bee called to fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, and yet have no communion with the viſible Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The reſt of this Section, wherein you enquire what thoſe promiſes are which are are made to the ſeed of beleevers, I ſhall (God willing) give you an account of them in the next part of the Sermon, whither now you call me; onely I cannot but take notice of your confident brag in the cloſe of this Section, how manfully <hi>you have entred my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, and thereby incourage your ſelfe to ſcale my walls:</hi> You indeed entred, and ſet up your flag, but I hope it appeares to the indifferent Reader that you are in no great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of getting any great ſpoile, unleſſe my walls prove weaker then the outworke, which as yet are farre from being taken by you.</p>

But notwithſtanding, by the helpe of God, I hope clearely to vindicate my arguments from your exceptions.</p>
               <p>My firſt Argument was, <hi>the Infants of beleeving parents are faederati, therefore they muſt be ſignati, they are within the Covenant

               </p>
               <p>This Argument, becauſe I knew the tearmes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and the reaſons of the conſequents would not be cleare at the firſt propounding, I therefore made no further proſecution of untill firſt I had cleared five concluſions <note place="margin">The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the argument made good.</note> from which it receives not onely its light, but ſtrength, and from which it ought not to bee ſeparated, becauſe in them I both prove a Covenant and ſigne initiall, this, firſt you aſſault ſingly, and <hi>denying both the propoſitions</hi> you try your ſtrength in this Section againſt <hi>the conſequence,</hi> and affirme <hi>that they who deny the conſequence doe it juſtly, becauſe</hi> (ſay you) <hi>if they who are faederati muſt be ſignati, it muſt bee ſo either by reaſon of ſome neceſſary connexion betweene the tearmes, or by reaſon of Gods will declared concerning the Covenant of Grace: but for neither of theſe cauſes; firſt, there is no neceſſary conſequence that God gives a promiſe, ergo he muſt give a ſeale, or a ſpeciall ſigne, Joſhuah had none for his promiſe of bringing Iſrael into Canaan; Phinehas none for his, for the Prieſthood to continue in his family; nor ſecondly, by any declaration of Gods will, Adam, and all the reſt to Abraham had none, yea, and in Abrahams time Melchiſedeck, Lot, Job; and for Abrahams family there was no ſuch univerſall order or declaration of Gods will, for children under eight dayes old, and all the females had no ſuch command, and therefore to have ſealed them, would have beene will-worſhip, and ſo you conclude here and in many other places of your booke, that it is not being</hi> foederati <hi>in Covenant which gives title to the ſeale, but onely the declaration of Gods will to have it ſo.</hi>

And when I ſaid, <hi>Such as have the inward grace, ought not to bee denyed the outward ſigne:</hi> You anſwer, <hi>There is none of the Antipaedobaptiſts but will grant that propoſition to bee true,</hi> pag. 142. And <hi>the preſent ſtate of a perſon is that which gives right to baptiſme,</hi> pag. 158. <hi>It's granted that</hi> (ſuch Infants) ſuch as are inwardly <hi>ſanctified are diſciples, and may not be debarred from baptiſme;</hi> mark, <hi>Infants diſciples;</hi> and is not this in plain Engliſh, <hi>That ſuch as are Covenanters, ought not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the initiall ſeale of the covenant;</hi> Now then, if I can prove that not onely ſuch as are inwardly regenerate, but others alſo, whether Infants or grown men are to bee reputed to belong to the Covenant, and that an externall viſible right <hi>(in facie viſibilis Eccleſiae)</hi> may be made out for any perſon or perſons, to be by us owned &amp; received as Covenanters with God, you your ſelfe grant that the ſeale may be applyed to them; and whether this bee ſo, or not, ſhall (God willing) afterwards fully appeare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer more <hi>particularly;</hi> 1. I grant with you that there is no neceſſary dependance between a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and a ſeale, the addition of a ſeale to a promiſe is of free grace, as well as the promiſe it ſelf; &amp; if God had never given any Sacrament or ſeal of his Covenant, wee ſhould have had no cauſe to complaine of him, he well deſerves to be believed upon his bare word. Nor 2. did I ever think that by Gods revealed will this Propoſition was true in <hi>all

ages</hi> of the Church; <hi>All Covenanters muſt bee ſealed,</hi> I carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it no higher then <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, when God firſt added this new mercy to his Church, vouchſafing a ſeal to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: And 3. from <hi>Abrahams</hi> time and ſo forward, I ſay it <hi>was Gods will,</hi> that ſuch as are in Covenant ſhould bee ſealed with the initiall ſeale of the Covenant, ſuppoſing them onely capable of the ſeale, and no ſpeciall barre put in againſt them by God himſelfe, which is apparent in the very firſt inſtitution of an initiall ſeale, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 9, 10, 14. Where the very ground why God would have them ſealed is becauſe of the Covenant, <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee and thy ſeed after thee in their generations for an everlaſting Covenant to be a God to thee and thy ſeed after thee: thou ſhalt keepe my Covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and this is my Covenant which yee ſhall keep, every man childe among you ſhall bee circumciſed;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the 14. the <hi>ſeale</hi> is, by a <hi>Metonymia</hi> called <hi>the Covenant,</hi> for that it's apparent not onely that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them who were in Covenant to be circumciſed, but that they ſhould <hi>therefore</hi> be circumciſed becauſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or in token of the Covenant betweene God and them; and he that rejected or neglected the ſeale, is ſaid not onely to breake Gods <hi>commandement,</hi> but his <hi>covenant:</hi> ſo that becauſe the initiall Seale was added to the Covenant, and ſuch as received it, received it as an evidence of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or <hi>becauſe</hi> they were in Covenant: I therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that by Gods own will, ſuch as enter into Covenant ought to receive the ſeal, ſuppoſing ſtill that they were capable of it. So that to lay Circumcifion upon Gods command, and the Covenant of grace too, are well conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent together; for the command is the cauſe of the exiſtence of the duty; but the Covenant of grace is the motive to it. 4. Whereas you alledge <hi>concerning Melchiſedeck, Lot, Job; we find no ſuch thing that they either received this ſeale of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi>

Or in what age of the world <hi>Job</hi> lived, though hee bee thought to be of the poſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and ſo might have

a right to it (even in your ſenſe) as deſcending lineally from <hi>Abraham;</hi> however this is a meere negative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matter of fact, which your ſelf know to bee of no validity; Negative arguments from Scripture are good in matters of faith. I am not bound to beleeve this or that, unleſſe it be found in the Scriptures; but they are not good in matter of fact; this or that fact is not recorded in the Scripture, therefore I am bound to beleeve it was not done, is no good conſequence; <hi>A non ſcripto ad non factum non valet conſequentia.</hi> No Scripture ſaith they were circumciſed, (though very good Authors thinke that <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> were circumciſed,) nor doth any Scripture ſay they were not circumciſed.</p>
               <p>As to that you ſay of <hi>Infants under eight dayes old, and of all the females in Abrahams family.</hi> I anſwer to that of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">And to Infants under eight dayes old.</note> there was a <hi>peculiar exemption of them by God himſelf,</hi> whether for any typicall reaſon, or in regard they were not fit in nature to undergoe ſo ſharp a paine as was to bee indured in Circumciſion, before the ſeventh and criticall day was paſt, or whether for any other cauſe, I diſpute not; it is ſufficient, God forbad them to have the ſeale till they were eight dayes old.

Next you <hi>reply</hi> to my anſwer concerning <hi>Women</hi> among <note place="margin">Women cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in the men, vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> the Jews, <hi>I ſaid they were circumciſed in the males:</hi> this you caſt away with ſcorne, <hi>affirming it to be an eaſie anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's eaſie to bee anſwered.</hi> Indeed Sir, you anſwer it as eaſily as he who undertooke to anſwer <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in one word, and ſaid, <hi>Bellarmine thou lyeſt:</hi> ſo you, <hi>it is an inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient anſwer to take away the exception againſt the propoſition, and that you</hi> might have a little matter to worke upon, you goe to another part of my Sermon, and thence you fetch the word <hi>virtually,</hi> with which you make your ſelfe merry putting my propoſition into <hi>ſeverall ſhapes and formes;</hi> and in one form (you ſay) <hi>it concludes not the thing in queſtion;</hi> in another, <hi>it hath</hi> 4 <hi>termes;</hi> in another, <hi>the major is falſe.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my plaine meaning was, and is, that the women being uncapable of it in their own perſon, becauſe of their ſex, wherein was a naturall impediment, as to this Sacrament, God impoſed it onely upon the Males, and yet the women were not eſteemed as uncircumciſed, being (as Divines uſe to expreſſe in this point) <hi>viris annexae &amp; in iis cenſerentur qui familiarum capita debebant eſſe;</hi> and whether this will not be juſtified, we ſhall preſently inquire. But firſt give me leave to obſerve by the way how you pinch me <hi>with a point of law, That no man can be ſaid virtually to have that by his Proxie or Atturney, which he might not actually receive himſelf in his own perſon.</hi> I queſtion whether this be <hi>good law,</hi> but I am confident it is <hi>bad Divinity;</hi> ſure we ſin'd virtually in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet we could not actually, though that ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> be ours by imputation. The ſun is virtually hot, yet Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſay it's not actually. And the Jews of old offered to God ſuch things by the hands of the Prieſts who were their Proxies in that work which they might not offer in their own perſons: yea, and received ſuch things by the hand of the high Prieſt (who bare their names in the moſt holy place) which they might not receive in their owne perſons immediately: and the Saints now in this world do virtually, and <hi>quoad effectum juris,</hi> receive ſome ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges in Chriſt their Advocate, who in their right, is at Godſ right hand, which here they are not capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:113537:51"/>
immediately in their own perſons. I alſo <hi>obiter</hi> deſire you to remember this expreſſion of yours, <hi>That it had beene a ſinne for a child to have been circumciſed after the eighth day was paſt.</hi> And try how you will reconcile this with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of yours delivered elſewhere; <hi>viz. That circumciſion might bee adminiſtred oftner then once;</hi> ſurely thoſe other times muſt be after the firſt eighth day.</p>
               <p>The other fault you note in my argument, is, <hi>That I conclude of a ſigne of the Covenant indefinitely, and not of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme onely; whereas the Lords Supper is alſo a ſigne of the Covenant; which yet you thinke I will ſay is not to bee delivered to them, becauſe not appointed for them:</hi> I anſwer, I clearely in my Sermon ſhewed this Propoſition onely to be meant of the <hi>initiall ſign,</hi> and not of the <hi>other;</hi> and I am confident your ſelf, who durſt <hi>baptize an Infant</hi> known to you to be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, durſt not yet give the other <hi>Sacrament</hi> to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe more is required to make one capable of that Sacrament, then is required to make them capable of Baptiſme: a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Infant you thinke is capable of this: but beſides regeneration, I am ſure you will grant, That an <hi>examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a mans ſelfe, and an ability to diſcern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the Lords body,</hi> is required to make one capable of that.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee how you avoid my proofes, That the <hi>Women were circumciſed in the men.</hi> My firſt was, That <hi>the whole houſe of Iſrael are in the Scripture ſaid to be circumciſed.</hi> You anſwer, <hi>That by the whole houſe of Iſrael muſt not be meant all, but the major part, or the moſt confiderable part.</hi> But Sir, doe you imagine that any of your judicious Readers can <note place="margin">Circumciſed not put for the major or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler part.</note> be ſatisfied with this anſwer, when (you know well enough) that the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is put for the <hi>Church and people of God,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>uncircumciſed</hi> that is, al the reſt of the world who are not the people of God. When <hi>Peter</hi> was to go to the <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to preach the Goſpel; does not <hi>circumciſion</hi> include the <hi>Women</hi> Jews, as much as the men, in oppoſition to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> as well as the word <hi>Gentiles</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the women Gentiles as well as the men, to whom <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 8.</note>

Nation of the Jewes, both men and women are there meant by Circumciſion, which could not have been, if in ſome ſenſe they were not to bee accounted Circumciſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I argued thus, <hi>No uncircumciſed perſon might eate the Paſſeover:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Their women might not have eaten it, if in ſome ſenſe they had not been circumciſed.</hi> Your anſwer is, <hi>This is to bee limited</hi> pro ſubjecta materia, <hi>none that ought to be circumciſed might eate the Paſſeover, unleſſe they were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</hi> But this anſwer is altogether inſufficient. For, 1. Where is this diſtinction of yours found, or founded in the Word of God? other diſtinctions about eating the <note place="margin">Reply.</note> Paſſeover, are clearely found, the <hi>cleane</hi> might eate it, the <hi>unclean</hi> might not eat it, the <hi>circumciſed</hi> might, the <hi>uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed</hi> might not: but of your limitation there is <hi>altum ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</hi>

If you ſay they were included in the houſhold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 3, 4. <hi>Every houſhold was to eate the Paſchall Lambe,</hi> and there was no <hi>exception of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> I reply, firſt, grant but the ſame conſequence, that when wee read ſo frequently in the new Teſtament, that whole houſholds were <hi>baptized,</hi> &amp; <hi>no exception of children,</hi> that therefore all the children in thoſe houſholds were baptized, and this controverſie is quickly ended But I adde further, it is not ſaid that the whole houſhold ſhall eate it, for all uncircumciſed perſons were forbidden to eat it, &amp; none but circumciſed perſons had any warrant to eat it. Yea further, ſuppoſe ſome words in the inſtitution ſhould reach the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh women,</hi> yet how doth it reach the <hi>women Gentiles,</hi> who ſhould prove Proſelytes to them? for <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48, 49. there is order taken for the <hi>male ſtranger, Let all his males be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and then let him come neare and keep it;</hi> but there is not any word that takes order for the <hi>ſtrangers females.</hi> I hope by this time it appears that your exceptions againſt the conſequence

of my Argument have no weight, <hi>they are</hi> foederati; <hi>therefore they are to be</hi> ſignati.</p>
               <p>Next come we to examine the truth of the Antecedent which I manifeſted in thoſe five Concluſions opened in my <note place="margin">Reply to Sect. 2.</note> Sermon: The firſt whereof is this, <hi>That the Covenant of Grace, for ſubſtance, hath alwayes been one and the ſame, both to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Covenant of grace always one and the ſame.</note> 
                  <hi>the Jewes and Gentiles. This firſt concluſion you grant;</hi> and therefore there were no need to have ſtayed the Reader any further about it; were it not that ſome of your exceptions doe almoſt recall your grant: If it bee in ſubſtance the ſame, though you ſhould reckon up a thouſand accidentall and locall differences, it were nothing to the purpoſe: but the firſt doth almoſt recall it; wherein you charge me <hi>to carry the narration of the Covenant made with</hi> Abraham, Gen. 17. <hi>as if it did onely containe the Covenant of Grace in Chriſt; whereas it is apparent</hi> (ſay you) <hi>out of the Text, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was a mixt Covenant, conſiſting of temporall benefits, the multiplying of</hi> Abrahams ſeed, <hi>poſſeſſion of</hi> Canaan, <hi>the birth of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>beſides the ſpirituall bleſſings.</hi> To which I reply, I meant <hi>ſo</hi> indeed, and ſo I plainly expreſſed my ſelfe, that all the difference betwixt the Covenant then made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the Covenant made with us, lies onely in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the adminiſtration of the Covenant, and not in the <note place="margin">The Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> no more mixt for ſubſtance then the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us.</note> Covenant it ſelfe. The Covenant it ſelf in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it holds out the ſame mercies, both <hi>ſpirituall and temporall,</hi> to them, and to us: Godlineſſe having all the promiſes both of this life, and that which is to come; and that they, and we have our right to all theſe promiſes upon the ſelfe ſame condition: earthly things indeed were to them promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more diſtinctly and fully, heavenly things more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſpringly then they are now to us; and on the contrary, ſpirituall things are more fully and clearely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to us then to them; and earthly promiſes more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and ſparingly: And that theſe temporall benefits which you mention, <hi>viz.</hi> multiplying of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, the birth of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan</hi> were all of them <hi>adminiſtrations</hi> of the Covenant of grace, they were

Theſe things I not onely <hi>aſſerted, but proved in my Sermon.</hi> If you think otherwiſe of theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſings, I deſire you to explain your meaning in your next. If you mean no more then this that all theſe temporall bleſſings were promiſed and given as flowing from the promiſe of Chriſt, and were ſubſervient to it, or were but types and ſhadowes of it, you meane no more then what wee all grant, who yet deny any more mixture in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> for the ſubſtance of it then there is in that made with us: and that the difference lies onely in the manner of adminiſtration. But I confeſſe I ſuſpect you have a further meaning, not onely becauſe you here mention the temporall bleſſings before the ſpirituall, and call the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but eſpecially that expreſſion which you owne from <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, that Circumciſion did primarily ſeale the temporall promiſe, and ſignified ſanctification but ſecondarily;</hi> what your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is in this expreſſion, I cannot tell, it hath an untoward looke, as if the meaning were, that God did primarily and chiefely, in a Covenant of Grace founded in Chriſt (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe promiſes to bee their portion) intend in the ſeale of it to ratifie temporall bleſſings which onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes <hi>vitam animalem;</hi> now that the Seale (I ſay) of this Covenant ſhould primarily, and chiefly give evidence to ſuch a porton which a people may enjoy, with whom God <note place="margin">Circumciſion ſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I named not Proſelytes to adde any ſtrength to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and becauſe they are called <hi>Gods people,</hi> I feared not to call them <hi>Abrahams children by profeſſion,</hi> and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have met with a quarrell for calling them who joyned to the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by that common name whereby the Church members were called, <hi>viz. the ſeede of Abraham</hi> or <hi>the children of Iſrael:</hi> and could no place of Scripture be produced where proſelytes are expreſly called by this name, the matter were not <hi>tanti.</hi> But if it were a thing of any moment, it would be no hard matter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce evidence ſufficient to prove that proſelytes were called Iſraelites and the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 10. and 22. compared, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 26. compared with Verſe 43. but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare.

proofe; I ſaid there was a ſort of proſelytes who were <hi>the ſeed of Abraham by profeſſion onely,</hi> or outward cleaving to the Covenant, who though they profeſſed <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, yet did not place their happineſſe in Chriſt, or make choyce of <hi>Abrahams</hi> God for their all-ſufficient portion. Sir, is this to joyne with <hi>Arminius</hi> in his interpretation of the ninth to the <hi>Romans?</hi> 1. How doe you prove that <hi>Arminius</hi> meanes the words which you cite, of Jewiſh Proſelytes? <hi>Nulli filii carnis cenſentur in ſemine,</hi> ſaith <hi>Arminius;</hi> doth hee meane that no proſelytes were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh? if ſo, I beleeve acute Mr. <hi>Bayne</hi> would <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bayne</hi> of of my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill juſticiaties were called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſeed.</note> have been more wary then to have oppoſed him in that point. Nay Mr. <hi>Bayne</hi> in the very ſelfe ſame page which you quote, having ſet downe <hi>Arminius</hi> his two concluſions. (1. The children of the promiſe are reckoned for the ſeed. 2. The children of the fleſh are not reckoned for the ſeed;) paſſes his judgement upon them in theſe words, Page 140. <hi>The Concluſions are true, but not pertinent to this ſenſe, for the children of the fleſh here, are thoſe onely who in courſe of nature came from Abraham.</hi> But you very wiſely mention neither of theſe Concluſions of <hi>Arminius,</hi> you thought it more for your advantage to faſten upon ſome other propoſition laid downe by <hi>Arminius,</hi> and as you ſet it downe it runs thus: There is a ſeed of <hi>Abraham, qui per opera legis juſtitiam &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem conſequuntur;</hi> I was much amuſed at the words. I know <hi>Arminius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deus ex promiſſe</hi> ac debito <hi>dat vitam aeternam operanti,</hi> but he meanes it not of the workes of the Law; and therefore I wondered to ſee <hi>opera legis</hi> in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but the word which puzled me moſt, was <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur.</hi> Sir, let me intreat you to correct your booke, there is no ſuch word as <hi>conſequuntur</hi> in <hi>Arminius</hi> his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it doth not agree with your own expoſition, for <hi>conſequuntur juſtitiam,</hi> is by you tranſlated; Follow after righteouſneſſe. I have peruſed <hi>Arminius,</hi> (with whom you ſay I joyn) and Mr. <hi>Bayne,</hi> from whom you ſay I ſay I differ, and I ſhall give an account of both to the reader.</p>
               <p>Firſt for <hi>Arminius,</hi> his words are theſe, <hi>Filii carnis Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolo hoc loco ſunt, qui per opera legis juſtitiam &amp; ſalutem</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectantur,

not <hi>conſequuntur:</hi> ſo that the queſtion between <hi>Arminius</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bayne,</hi> is, whether in that place, namely, in the 9 to the Romans, the Apoſtle by children of the fleſh, doe meane ſuch as ſeek righteouſneſſe by the Law? <hi>Hoc in loco,</hi> ſaith <hi>Arminitor,</hi> the phraſe is to bee ſo interpreted in this place; No, ſaith Mr. <hi>Bayne,</hi> it is not to bee taken ſo in this place, though it may be taken ſo in other places: I ſhall ſet down Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> his own words, that the Reader may ſee how groſſely you have abuſed me; <hi>For though</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Bayne) children of the fleſh in ſome other Scripture, doth note</hi>

The words which cleare me, are within ſix lines of thoſe words which Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> cites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me: whether Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> be guilty of negligence or falſhood, I leave to your judgement. 4.

               <p>Fourthly, Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> ſpeaks of Abrahams <hi>ſeed by celling,</hi> and ſaith that promiſe, [I will be the God of thy ſeed] was made good to Abraham in the calling of the Gentiles, <hi>pag.</hi> 43.

If Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> ſay that it is better to term them ſeed by calling, then ſeed by profeſſion; if it bee but an outward call, where lyes the difference?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Mr. <hi>Bayne</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> are agreed, that by the ſeed of Abraham, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8. is meant the elect onely, <hi>Omnes filii promiſſionis cenſentur in ſemine, nulli filii carnis cenſentur in ſentine,</hi> ſaith <hi>Arminius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, the principall difference between Mr. <hi>Bayne</hi> and <hi>Arminius,</hi> is, that this elect ſeed was elected upon Gods foreſight of their faith, as <hi>Arminius</hi> would have it; but I joyne with Mr. <hi>Bayne</hi> in deteſting this opinion, as injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the free and effectuall grace of God: and Mr. <hi>Bayne</hi> joynes with me, in confeſſing that in ſome places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they who ſeek to bee juſtified by the Law, are termed children of the fleſh.

That they are caſt out from being heires, never to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſpirituall priviledges of the Covenant; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is apparent that even theſe (who <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid were ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by the ſon of <hi>Hagar)</hi> had a viſible ſtanding in the Jewiſh Church, and were partakers of outward Church priviledges, and were the ſame of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>Who being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſſe, and going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe, have not ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> And that in the ſame place <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſaith, <hi>even ſo it is now,</hi> (even in the Church of <hi>Gallatia</hi> it was ſo) and <hi>Paul</hi> by this Doctrine laboured to make them better.)

upon a viſible profeſſion, and that rightly, even by a judgement of faith, though their inward holineſſe be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us; for ſo much you grant, <hi>pag.</hi> 159. and if by a judgement of faith a Miniſter as Gods Steward may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence the ſeale of the Covenant of grace, and not ſtay from applying the ſeale to him, who makes an outward profeſſion, becauſe wee have not a Spirit of diſcerning, to know them to bee reall beleevers; then it undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That ſome may rightly be accounted to belong to the Church of God, and Covenant of grace, beſide reall beleevers, which is as much as I need, to make my ſenſe and meaning in this Propoſition to paſſe for currant. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sir, whoever will grant that a Miniſter in applying the ſeale, muſt doe it <hi>de fide,</hi> in faith, being aſſured he applyes it according to rule; muſt either grant ſuch a right as I plead for, that many have right to bee viſible members, and bee partakers of the externall adminiſtration of Ordinances, though they be not inwardly ſanctified; or elſe hee muſt by revelation be able to ſee and know the inward converſion of every one hee applyes the ſeale unto; for certainly hee hath no written Word to build his faith upon, for the ſtate of this or that man. And for my own part, when once you have diſproved this, that there is ſuch a viſible memberſhip and right to externall adminiſtrations as I have here infiſted upon, I ſhall not onely forbeare baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, but the adminiſtration of the externall ſeale to any, what profeſſion ſoever they make, untill I may bee <hi>de fide</hi> aſſured, that they are inwardly regenerate.</p>

an indeavour, wherein you doe but loſe time, and waſte paper for many pages together, endeavouring to confute what was never aſſerted by me; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Covenant of <hi>ſaving grace</hi> is made to beleevers and their naturall ſeed; that the Infants of beleevers are ſo within the Covenant of grace, as to be <hi>elected,</hi> and to have all the <hi>ſpirituall priviledges</hi> of the Covenant belonging to them; this you would needs have to be my meaning: and I almoſt ſuſpect you would faſten this ſenſe upon mee, againſt your owne light; for <hi>pag.</hi> 142. you doe as good as cleare mee of it; where you ſay, <hi>You ſuppoſe that I doe not hold, that the Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers indifferently have actually the thing ſignified by baptiſme, union with Chriſt, adoption, pardon of ſinne, regeneration, &amp;c.</hi> So that in all this diſcourſe, you doe but <hi>luctari cum larvis,</hi> according to your owne expreſſion, <hi>pag.</hi> 45. my plain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was as is before expreſſed; nor doe any of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions uſed by mee, and here brought by you as Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove this to be my meaning, hold forth any ſuch thing; as, <hi>they are within the Covenant of grace, belonging to Chriſts body, kingdome, houſhold; therefore are to partake of the ſeale.</hi> True, as viſible profeſſors are, <hi>quà</hi> viſible.

               <p>One Argument more you bring (beſide laying of my words together) to prove that this muſt needs bee my ſenſe, becauſe you doubt not but my meaning is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Directory,</hi> which holds forth, That <hi>the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are made to beleevers and their ſeed:</hi> and directs Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to pray, That <hi>God would make Baptiſme to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant a ſeale of adoption, regeneration, and eternall life.</hi> And

                  <hi>to Infants, in vaine are they baptized, and the ſeale is put to a blank;</hi> To which I reply, my meaning is indeed according to the ſenſe of the Directory, and according to that direction, I doe pray that God would make baptiſme to bee a ſeale to the Infant of adoption, and the reſt of the ſaving graces of the Covenant; yet I utterly deny you conſequence, that unleſſe there bee abſolute promiſes of ſaving grace to Infants, the Seale is ſet to a blank, for give mee leave but to put the ſame caſe; firſt, for the Infants of the Jewes, was the ſeale put to a blanke with them, or had they all promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſaving graces? Secondly, let mee put the ſame caſe in <hi>growne men,</hi> who make an externall viſible profeſſion, and thereupon are admitted to baptiſme, can any man ſay, that all the ſaving graces of the Covenant, or the ſpirituall part of it, is promiſed to all viſible profeſſors? is it not abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly knowne that in all ages, even in the beſt times, even in the Apoſtles times, multitudes were baptized, to whom God yet never gave ſaving graces, and therefore never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them? for had hee made a promiſe, hee would have performed it. But I ſhall deſire you a little to conſider the nature of a Sacrament, in what ſenſe it is a ſeale, and then you neede ſtumble at this no longer; theſe <hi>three things</hi> are neceſſarily to be diſtinguiſhed, firſt, <hi>the truth of the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in a Sacrament; and ſecondly, <hi>my intereſt in that thing;</hi> And thirdly, <hi>my obligation, to doe what is required in or by that Sacrament:</hi> I ſay therefore, that in every Sacrament, the truth of the Covenant in it ſelfe, and all the promiſes of it are ſealed to be Yea, and Amen; Jeſus Chriſt became a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the circumciſion, to confirme the promiſes made unto the Fathers, &amp; ſo to every one who is admitted to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Baptiſme, according to the rule which God hath given to his Church, to adminiſter that Sacrament, there is <hi>ſealed the truth of all the promiſes of the Goſpel,</hi> that they are all true in Chriſt, and that whoever partakes of Chriſt, ſhall partake of all theſe ſaving promiſes; this is ſealed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in Baptiſme, but as to the ſecond, which is <hi>intereſſe meum,</hi> or the receivers intereſt in that ſpirituall part of the

Now for the third thing, <hi>the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which is put upon the receiver, a bond or the for him to performe, who is admitted to receive the Sacrament, this third I ſay is alſo abſolute, all Circumciſed and Baptized perſons did or doe ſtand abſolutely ingaged to performe the conditions required on their part, and therefore all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed perſons were by <hi>the circumciſion oblieged to keepe the Law,</hi> that is, that legall and typicall adminiſtration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which was then in force, and Infants among the reſt were bound to this, though they had no underſtanding of the Covenant, or that adminiſtration of the Covenant, when this Seale was adminiſtred to them. Now then, ſince in Baptiſme there is firſt an abſolute Seale of the truth of the Covenant of grace in it ſelfe, a conditionall ſeale of the receivers intereſt in the Covenant, and an abſolute obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the receiver to make good the Covenant on his part, is there any reaſon that you ſhould ſay, that the ſeale is put to a blank, where the ſpirituall part or ſaving grace is not partaked of? What you further ſay here, that by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> who is the father of the faithfull is meant <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſon, and not every beleever, that it was a perſonall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not a common priviledge to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers as beleevers, which thing you repeate very often, it ſhall bee conſidered in a more proper place. So that, you having thus wholly miſtaken my ſenſe, and undertaken to diſpute againſt a ſenſe which I never owned, I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſſe over your ſix arguments which you bring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this ſenſe which you have ſet downe: I joyne with

And therefore although in ſome of your fix reaſons there are divers expreſſions which I cannot ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yet I ſhall not here ſtay upon them, but examine them when you bring them elſewhere to diſpute againſt mee, as here you doe not; onely give mee leave to touch upon the <hi>laſt</hi> of your fix arguments, becauſe in ſome ſenſe it militates <note place="margin">How Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity may bee called a birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</note> againſt my Theſis, <hi>Iſ this were true,</hi> ſay you, <hi>that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace is a birthright priviledge, then the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are the children of grace by nature, then Chriſtians are borne Chriſtians, not made Chriſtians; if the child of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an be borne a Chriſtian, as the child of a Turke is borne a Turke; and if ſo, how are they borne the children of wrath as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>According to the ſenſe which I owne I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this aſſertion to bee true,</hi> that the child of a Chriſtian is borne a Chriſtian, it is his birthright to bee ſo eſteemed; I meane to bee reputed within the Covenant of grace, or a member of the viſible Church, <hi>our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>For firſt, though <hi>Abraham</hi> was the father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſo in ſome ſenſe [the root, as you elſewhere call him:] yet the Covenant was made with him for <hi>his faiths ſake,</hi> and <hi>believers</hi> are his children and heires, and partake of thoſe priviledges and promiſes which were made to

               <p>Secondly, had it been a peculiar priviledge to <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall ſeed, Proſelytes of other Nations could never by vertue of their becomming followers of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, have brought their children into Covenant with them, ſo as to have a viſible Church-memberſhip, as wee know they did.</p>

               <p>After I had opened the ſcope of the Argument, I procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to examine what exceptions are made againſt it.

                  </gap> which I ſaid was inſufficient to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd the force of this Argument, is their interpretation <note place="margin">2 Exception.</note> 
                  <hi>who ſay, To you and your children, muſt bee thus limited,</hi> viz. <hi>as many of them as the Lord ſhall call,</hi> that is, when any of your children come to bee <hi>called,</hi> this promiſe ſhall bee made good unto them; now I ſaid this was but a ſhift, becauſe the Apoſtles Argument is taken from the benefit which ſhould come to their children, which would bee no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all; becauſe with this limitation, it holds forth no
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:113537:70"/>
more to the children <hi>of beleevers</hi> then <hi>to Pagans,</hi> the promiſe is made to as many as God ſhall call, that is, <hi>to you, to your children, and to Pagans, and their children as much as to you and your children;</hi> what argument can this afford <hi>from a benefit which their children ſhould receive if they beleeved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this ſay you <hi>is the genuine and neceſſary explication of the Text, for let the promiſe bee what it can bee, whether of ſaving graces, of outward priviledges, of extraordinary gifts, it is no wayes true without that limitation, as many as the Lord ſhall call.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is but a deceiving of your Reader with an <hi>equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> in the word <hi>call,</hi> for if you meane of <hi>inward effectnall</hi>

But if you meane it of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling, then I not onely <hi>aſſert,</hi> but have already <hi>proved</hi> their Infants injoy this calling with them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot deny that the Apoſtle here meant to fetch <note place="margin">3.

               </p>
               <p>But I reply, firſt, there is nothing in the Text to evince it, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that all theſe men either uttered that curſe, or were privie to it: for though <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid they had crucified him, he meant <hi>the Scribes and Phariſees had done it,</hi> and elſewhere hee ſaies, the <hi>Jewes which dwelt. at Ieruſalem had done it:</hi> it is moſt probable that many of theſe ſtranger Jewes knew nothing of it. Secondly, let it bee granted that they both knew it
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:113537:71"/>
and were parties in it, and ſo conſequently that the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the promiſe was the more ſeaſonable to them, yet becauſe it was the promiſe of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which belonged to every Covenanter, that God in Chriſt would bee a God to them and to their ſeed, and that hee preſſed it to them as to thoſe who were children of the Covenant, <hi>Acts,</hi> Chap. 3. Verſe 25. this Argument taken from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had been of uſe, though that ſpeech had never beene uttered.</p>
               <p>As for that which you call the witleſſe deſcant I put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my adverſaries, while I ſay the Argument muſt run thus, that if the Apoſtle muſt be interpreted, (as theſe men would have him) to you and your children, ſo many of them as the Lord ſhall call, <hi>viz. you and your children have hitherto been an holy ſeed. But now if you beleeve in Chriſt your ſelves, your children ſhall bee in no better condition then the reſt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan world, but if afterward any of them or any of the heathen ſhall beleeve and be baptized, their particular perſons ſhall be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant, but their Children ſtill left out, this</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>would not have been a very comfortable Argument to perſwade them to come in, in relation to the good of their children.</hi> To this your anſwer is, <hi>that this witleſſe deſcant followes not on the applying the reſtriction in the end of the verſe, to them, their children, and all that are afarre off; and that which I burden my adverſaries Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net with, of putting beleevers Infants out of the Covenant into the condition of Pagans children is a Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How then could this argument be fit to be uſed? tel me I pray you, ſuppoſe a man held ſome Farm or Office under ſome great man, and that in his Grant or Patent, there were ſome apparent priviledges or benefits included concerning his poſterity; If now the Lord of whom hee held it, ſhould offer him a new Grant in which his children ſhould be expreſſely left out, and no more priviledges for them then for meere ſtrangers, could an Argument bee taken from the benefit that ſhould come to his Children, to perſwade him to give up his former, and accept this latter Grant? I thinke not. And whereas you call that expreſſion of putting of the children of beleevers into the ſame ſtate with the children of Turks, <hi>a Coccyſme which you have anſwered before.</hi> I pardon your ſcornfull expreſſion, you doe but <hi>kick</hi> at that which <hi>bites</hi> you, it is a truth which you have no cauſe to delight to heare of; you have anſwered it indeed, by granting the truth of it, as the Reader may plainly ſee in my Anſwer to your 10 Section of the ſecond Part; and to Sect. 3. of this part.</p>
               <p>Whereas I further ſaid in my Sermon, <hi>except in relation to the Covenant, there was no occaſion to name their children, it bad been ſufficient to have ſaid a promiſe is made to as many as the Lord ſhall call.</hi> You anſwer, <hi>Their children indeed are named in relation to the Covenant: But there was another reaſon then that which I alledge; not onely their imprecation,</hi> Matth. 27. 25. <hi>but eſpecially becauſe Chriſt was firſt ſent to the Jews and their children, Acts</hi> 3. 26. I Reply, but this reaſon which you alledge affords no Argument for them now, to beleeve and repent from any benefit ſhould come to their poſterity by vertue of that promiſe, <hi>I will bee thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To cloſe this Section, you ſay, <hi>The Antipadobaptiſts have hence a good Argument againſt baptizing of Infants, becauſe</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>required of ſuch as were in Covenant repentance before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms.</hi> I anſwer, juſt as good an one, as becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was in Covenant, and an actuall beleever, and juſtified by the faith he had in uncircumciſion, and received it as a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith; therefore all theſe muſt go
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:113537:72"/>
before Circumciſion; and becauſe all who turned Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes to the Jews, muſt firſt make profeſſion of their faith; therefore none may bee circumciſed but ſuch as they are. But more of this when we conſider this Argument in your Exercitation.</p>
               <p>Next, let us try whether your ſucceſſe bee any better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the next Text of Scripture which I brought to prove <note place="margin">

                  <hi>graffing into the true Olive which the Jewes formerly had; and our preſent graffing in is anſwerable to their preſent caſting out; and their taking in at the latter end of the World, ſhall bee the ſame graffing in [though more gloriouſly] as ours is now; and it is apparent that at their firſt graffing in, they and their chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dren were taken in; at their caſting out they and their children were broken off; and when they ſhall be taken in again at the end of the world, they and their children ſhall be taken in together; and all this by vertue of the Covenant,</hi> Ero Deus tuus, &amp;c. <hi>Which is the ſame to us and to them, we and they making up the Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In your <hi>Examen</hi> of this Argument you ſtill proceed in your <hi>old</hi> method; firſt to caſt ſcorne upon it, as ſuch an obſcure Argument, <hi>That none but a Diver of Delos can fetch up the meaning of it:</hi> and indeed, ſhould you not pretend difficulties, you could have no colour to bring in ſo many imaginary ſenſes; thereby to darken an Argument, which is the ſecond branch of your Artifice: <hi>As whether this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing be meant of the viſible, or inviſible Church, by faith, or profeſſion of ſaith certain, by reaſon of election, or Covenant of grace made to them, or probable and likely, becauſe for the moſt part it happens ſo,</hi> &amp;c. Alas Sir, why doe you thus ſtrip your ſelfe to dive under the water, when the ſenſe ſwims upon the top: Look how the Jewes were Gods people, ſo are the Churches of the Gentiles; looke how the Jewes children were graffed in, ſo are our children, we are taken in, in ſtead of them who were caſt out, and become one viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt with the reſt of, them who kept their ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:113537:72"/>
this is the plaine ſenſe of my Argument. Now if you pleaſe but to apply all your imaginary ſenſes to the Jews and their children, and ſay, if they and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were graffed in together, was it into the viſible, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Church? was it by faith, or the profeſſion of faith? was it certain or probable? Doe you not thinke your Reader would ſmile at the vanity of theſe queſtions?</p>
               <p>When you have ſet downe your ſenſes, next you thus proceed, the thing that is to be proved is, <hi>That all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of every beleever are in the Covenant of Free grace in Chriſt, and by vertue thereof to bee baptized into the Communi- of the viſible Church.</hi> No Sir, the thing to bee proved from this Text, is, That <hi>our infants have the ſame right which the infants of the Jews had, and your Arguments fight</hi> againſt the Infants of the Jews, as much as againſt the Infants of the Gentiles; for [to apply your own words ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers now, to the Jewes then,] <hi>Though it may bee granted that the infants of the Jews were for the moſt part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the election and Covenant of grace, and ſo in the viſible Church; yet it will not follow that every infant of a Jew, in as much as hee is the child of a Jew, or a beleever, is under the Covenant of grace, becauſe we have Gods expreſſe declaration to the contrary,</hi> Rom. 9. 6, 7, 8. and all experience proves the contrary; is not this as much againſt the one as the other?</p>
               <p>To what I ſaid, the Jewes Infants were graffed in by Circumciſion; therefore ours are to be ingraffed in by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. You anſwer, <hi>by demanding whether in good ſadneſſe I doe thinke the Apoſtle here meanes by graffing in, baptizing or Circumciſion, or inciſion by outward Ordinances; for if that were the meaning, then breaking off muſt be meant of uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or unbaptizing.</hi> To which I reply, that in good ſober ſadneſſe I do think that <hi>graffing in</hi> is admiſſion into viſible memberſhip, or viſible communion with the Church of Chriſt; and that the externall ſeale of their viſible graffing in was <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and of ours <hi>Baptiſme;</hi> and yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not, that breaking off is onely uncircumciſing, or unbaptizing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but breaking off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

But to you it ſeems <hi>that ingraffing here, is meant of the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church by election and faith:</hi> I Reply, if it be meant of the inviſible Church onely; and that all who are graffed in, in the Apoſtles ſenſe, whether Jews or Gentiles, are onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectones, I will ſolemnly promiſe you never to plead this Scripture more, for any Infants, either of Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; no nor for viſible Profeſſors of either of them; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided onely if you cannot make that good, you will [as indeed you muſt] yeeld that ſome are to be reputed viſible Church-members, though not elect, whether Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and that our graffing in, is as theirs was; they and their children, we and our children; and if you pleaſe, let us a little try it out. The Text is plaine, ſome of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were broken off, ſuch branches whoſe naturall grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Olive yeelded them that priviledge which they now partake of who are graffed in in their ſtead; were theſe broken off from the inviſible Church? you dare not ſay ſo: if then the Olive from which they were broken off, bee the viſible Church, I have enough: and I wonder that any but an <hi>Arminian,</hi> ſhould make any queſtion that the Apoſtle ſpeaks onely of rejecting the Nation of the Jewes from being the viſible Church, and taking the body of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in their ſtead, to be Gods viſible Kingdom; in that it is meant of ſuch an ingraffing as may be broken off, which cannot bee from the inviſible Church. But let us ſee how you ſeek to evade this, and how you prove that it muſt bee meant of the inviſible Church: <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſay you) <hi>bad a a double capacity, one of a naturall Father, and another the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull; in reſpect of the former capacity, ſome are called branches according to nature; others wilde Olives by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet graffed in by faith: and when it is ſaid that ſome of the naturall branches were brokin off, the meaning is not that ſome of the branches of the inviſible Church may be broken off; but onely ſuch as were ſo in appearance, according as our Saviour expreſſes it</hi> Joh. 15. 2. But I Reply, I profeſſe I underſtand not how this diſtinction gives you the leaſt helpe, for tell me I pray you, were not theſe whom you cal naturall branches is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Olive as they who being wilde by nature were yet
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:113537:73"/>
graffed in, in the ſtead of them who were broke off? If they were, how doth this diſtinction help you? You ſay indeed, That <hi>the Infants of beleeving Jewes were not in the Covenant of grace, becauſe they were their children:</hi> if by this you meane they were not members of the inviſible Church, you ſay the truth, but nothing to the purpoſe. But if your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be, that they had not a viſible memberſhip, ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing as gave them a right to outward Ordinances; you not onely contradict the Scripture, but your ſelfe, who plead this, <hi>That it was a peculiar priviledge to</hi> Abraham, <hi>that his children ſhould have ſuch a viſible ſtanding as ours have not:</hi> plainly, the Jewes were the naturall branches, ſome of them were elect, ſome not, the body of them were the branches ſpoke of in this place; many of theſe were broke off, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them kept their ſtation; yet Gods election failes not; even ſo is it now, the Gentiles were graffed in, that is, their viſible faith gave them a viſible ingraffing, their inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faith gave them (who have it) an inviſible member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: yea, to me your ſelfe ſeem to ſay as much, when <hi>pag.</hi> 63. you affirme, <hi>inciſion may be either into the viſible or inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church; graffing in, may be either by faith, or profeſſion of faith.</hi> And pag. 65. <hi>It is true that our preſent graffing in, is anſwerable to [or rather for their] caſting out; that is, God would ſupply in his Olive tree the Church, the caſting away of the Iews by the calling of the Gentiles, ſo much the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>thou being a wilde Olive, wer't graffed in,</hi> in ramorum defra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum locum, <hi>into the place of the branches broken off; if you mean it in this ſenſe (ſay you)</hi> I <hi>grant it.</hi> And truly Sir, in theſe words, to my underſtanding, you grant not onely my interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this place, but even the queſtion controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us. Firſt, you grant my interpretation, that it is not meant of the inviſible, but the viſible Church: for I know you will not ſay that any of the elect Jewes were broken off, and the Gentiles elected and put into their place. It muſt therefore be meant of the viſible, and of the viſible Church of the New Teſtament; and that thoſe Jewes who kept their ſtation, and we who are in the roome of thoſe that were broke off, doe make that Olive which the Jewes
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:113537:74"/>
made before. Yea ſecondly, you by neceſſary confequence grant, that our children are taken in as theirs were, we are graffed in, <hi>in ramorum defractorum loeum; we ſupply in the Olive tree the Church, the caſting away of the Jews.</hi> Now if we thus ſupply, our children ſupply the place of their children which were broken off; and beſide, we are one with the reſt of the Jews who remained in this Olive; and their remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Olive, did not (I hope) deprive them of that priviledge which before-times they had for their children, and therefore we muſt have the ſame with them, and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then they had for their children, none of us ever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though ours be clearer, and a greater meaſure of grace accompanying it.</p>
               <p>You goe on, and ſay, <hi>when ſome of the naturall branches were cut off, it is not meant any otherwiſe then our Saviour Chriſt meanes,</hi> Joh. 15. 2. <hi>Every branch in me not bearing fruit hee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 2. proves the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to be true.</note> 
                  <hi>takes away; that is, not that any branch truly in him could bee fruitleſſe, or taken away, but onely thoſe branches which were ſo in appearance.</hi> I reply, that this is my very meaning, that this ſtanding as branches of the Olive, is not to be limited to the inviſible, but takes in the viſible alſo, not reſtrained to ſuch as have a ſpirituall union with Chriſt by faith, but takes in alſo the externall profeſſion of faith, which oft times is not in truth, that which it appears to be.</p>
               <p>Whereas you ſay, <hi>the Apoſtles ſcope in the whole chapter is to anſwer that queſtion; Hath God caſt away his people, &amp;c. and not to ſhew that wee have now the ſame graffing into the true Olive which the Jews formerly had.</hi> I anſwer, I undertook not to Analize the whole Chapter, but to open the ſcope of that matter or argument which begins at the 16 ver. and that you cannot gainſay, but that there the Apoſtle makes an Argument from our graffing in in their ſtead. <hi>And you minde me alſo of my owne diſtinction of the ſubſtance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the adminiſtration of it.</hi> Sir, I thank you for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring me of it, it is of very good uſe in this place, though not of that uſe which you bring it for, we have the ſame <hi>Covenant</hi> with them for the ſubſtance; which Covenant conſiſts of the ſame bleſſings, and is applyable upon the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:113537:74"/>
ſame conditions, belongs to the ſame ſorts of perſons, but the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of it, is clean differing from theirs. You grant, <hi>That by faith wee partake of the ſubſtance of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in reſpect of which, all beleeving Gentiles are</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed.</hi> Yea, and you may adde, viſible beleevers are his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeed: <hi>But if you mean it</hi> (ſay you) <hi>of the outward admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this ingraffing by Circumciſion, Baptiſme, &amp;c. nothing is more falſe, the outward adminiſtration is utterly taken away; and to affirme that it is not, were to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>vacuate the blood of Chriſt in this particular.</hi> But Sir, this is at the beſt but cunning dealing, and in part, a confident falſe aſſertion; it is cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſay by Circumciſion, Baptiſme, &amp;c. as if both theſe belonged to one adminiſtration. Indeed to affirme that ingraffing into the viſible Church, ſhould now bee by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, were to evacuate the death of Chriſt in that particular; but to ſay [as you ought, if you would ſpeake plainly] that to have our initiation now by Baptiſme into the viſible Church, as formerly by Circumciſion; or to ſay that all outward adminiſtrations of the Covenant are now utterly taken away, [though the old one is vaniſhed] is not onely a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fident, but a falſe aſſertion, and if you ſay not this, you apply my diſtinction to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>You goe on, whereas I ſaid <hi>their taking in in the end of the world wil be as ours, they and their children;</hi> you grant <hi>this is true.</hi> If it be true, that their children by being the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers ſhal be accounted to belong to the Church, you grant my Argument, if you meane not ſo, but think that at their laſt and beſt reſtauration, their children ſhal not enjoy that priviledge which they had when they were Gods people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, why doe you not ſay ſo, that all the world may ſee that you think in their beſt condition they ſhall bee depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of that glorious priviledge which they enjoyed in their non-age? and yet you grant, <hi>That they and their children ſhall bee taken in, yea and a more full taking in of the children of the Jews, then is now of the Gentiles, according to that,</hi> Rom. 11. 26. <hi>And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved. But</hi> (ſay you) <hi>all this proves not, that God would have either all Infants of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, counted his as elect perſons, or in the Covenant of grace in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:113537:75"/>
Chriſt, or in the face of the viſible Church admitted to Baptiſme.</hi> I anſwer, the thing to be proved was, our Infants have the ſame priviledge with theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>that</hi> it proves abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as for election, wee are not to eſteem all viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whether Infants or grown men, to bee elected, God having declared the contrary, this being true in all ages of the Church, <hi>Many are called, and but few choſen.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when we ſpeak of particulars, wee have the ſame ground of charitable hope for one as for another. As for your other expreſſion, <hi>That this proves not that they are to bee looked upon as viſible members of the Church, and to be admitted to outward Ordinances;</hi> this is onely to deny the Concluſion, whether this being proved, that our Infants have the ſame right to bee reckoned to the Church of God, as well as the Infants of the Jews, be not a juſt ground, and as good a foundation to prove, that therefore they muſt bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that Ordinance which is the initiall ſeale, ſhall in due time appeare, when I have made good the next con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, That <hi>Baptiſme ſucceeds in the roome of circumciſion to that uſe;</hi> in the meane time let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>I further ſaid of the Jews, <hi>they ſhall by vertue of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant bee taken in againe in the end of the world, becauſe the root is holy, becauſe Gods covenant with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>extends yet to them, and ſhall againe bloſſome, and will take place, when the Nations unbeleefe ſhall bee taken away, and their preſent nationall condition I ſhadowed out in the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of</hi> Nebuchadnezzars <hi>dreame, Dan.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>of a tree that was cut downe, and the root bound with an iron chaine, and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward did grow again.</hi> The thing it ſelf you deny not, nor go about to anſwer my argument drawn from the Jewes, <hi>viz.</hi> we, as they, were taken in; they, and their children ſhall be at the laſt taken in againe, as they were at the firſt: and therefore we and they making up the ſame body, are taken in upon the ſame ground, our children with us, as well as theirs with them; this Argument (I ſay) you go not about to anſwer, but in ſtead of anſwering, you <hi>pick quarrels againſt my compariſon taken from</hi> Nebuehadnezzars <hi>dreame.</hi> Why Sir, I never thought a Scholar would have expected a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:113537:75"/>
ſhould runne upon foure feet; nor have wreſted it beyond what was intended by it, I never intended to make <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> dreame an argument to prove, but onely to illuſtrate, that as that tree for a while was cut downe, and the root bound with an Iron chaine, was kept from growing, yet in the end the chaine was removed, and the tree grew againe; ſo the nation of the Jewes was for a while caſt off, from being the people of God, during the time of their blindneſſe and unbeleefe, but in the end the vaile ſhould be removed, and their nation taken into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Church-ſtanding, yea and more gloriouſly, and that by reaſon of the Covenant; But from this you ſeeke to draw many abſurdities, and to ſhew wherein my compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon holds not; as <hi>this tree is not cut downe as that was, onely ſome branches broken off, and that to make Abraham the root; to bee bound with a chaine is unhandſome;</hi> and that in this allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fion, <hi>I ſometimes make Abraham the roote, ſometimes the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant the root, &amp;c.</hi> all which are worthy of no anſwer; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being held out in the alluſion but what I now ſaid; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, were it pertinent to our controverſie it might eaſily enough be ſhewed, how in a ſound ſenſe the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is the root upon which <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the reſt of the branches grow, and alſo how by vertue of the Covenant, <hi>Abraham</hi> is alſo a root from which his ſeed grow, yea, and ſeverall beleevers are roots from which their poſteritie ſprings, and how in one ſound ſenſe <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and all viſible beleevers make up this one tree this Olive, and yet in another ſenſe they are all but branches of this Olive.</p>
               <p>Whereas I ſaid <hi>in all this diſcourſe, the holineſſe of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches there ſpoke of, is not meant of a perſonall inherent holineſſe, but an holineſſe derived to them from their Anceſtors, a faederall holineſſe.</hi> Againſt this you except many things. Firſt, Mr. <hi>Goodwin expounds it otherwiſe:</hi> if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> meane that there is no other holines which may make men eſteemed ſo in <hi>facie dei</hi> according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> I concur with him, but if he ſay there is no other holineſſe, or that the profeſſion of holineſſe may not make him paſſe as holy <hi>in facie viſibilis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae,</hi>

when I heare him ſay ſo (as yet I never did) I ſhall diſſent from him though hee be my loving friend. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſay you, <hi>bere are divers things to be marked indeed, but with an obeliske:</hi> indeed Sir that brand is alwayes ready at your hand, let us ſee whether you have ſet it juſtly or no in this place, and whether your impartiall Reader will not take <note place="margin">Derivative and inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> it off and ſet it upon your ſelfe. <hi>I oppoſe</hi> (ſay you) <hi>perſonall inherent holineſſe, to derivative holineſſe as inconſiſtent:</hi> but Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der looke into my Sermon, and ſee whether I did ſo or no; I confidently deny this charge, I onely ſhewed the meaning of the word <hi>in this place</hi> to bee of derivative holineſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the whole nation, not excluding perſonall inherent holineſſe in true beleevers among them; and I ſay again, the whole nation was called <hi>holy,</hi> not perſonally inherent, but federally; and you acknowledge here a derivative holineſſe from <hi>Abraham</hi> as a ſpirituall father, yet I ſuppoſe you will not undertake to juſtifie that true inherent holineſſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from any, but from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his holy ſpirit. Next ſay you, <hi>this holineſſe is derived not from any Anceſters, but onely from Abraham.</hi> But I beſeech you in your next not onely to dictate this, as in this booke you doe very often; but cleare and prove it by ſome good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, why it does not deſcend from other immediate parents, who are beleevers, as well as originally from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> for parents who are branches from <hi>Abraham</hi> their father, are yet rootes to their children who ſpring from them; Doe wee not read of the <hi>root of Ieſſe, Eſay</hi> 11? though hee was but a branch from <hi>Abraham,</hi> might not every pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent among the Jewes, at leaſt every beleeving parent apply that promiſe made to <hi>Abraham, I will bee the God of thee, and thy ſeed?</hi> if you thinke hee may not, diſprove the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I have brought for it, in anſwer to your ſixt Section. I demand further, was not ſuch a holineſſe derived from <hi>Abraham</hi> to his naturall ſeed, or poſteritie, where all <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie, who are called the holy ſeed, <hi>true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and inwardly holy?

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:113537:76"/>
I reply, firſt, this is to ſay and unſay; <hi>Abraham</hi> onely is an holy roote, yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> are holy roots too. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Apoſtle names none of them at all, but ſpeakes of <hi>the fathers,</hi> which includes all their Anceſtors, at leaſt more then <hi>Abraham</hi> onely. Thirdly, how often did God (as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) renew that promiſe, I will bee the God of thee and of thy ſeed, after <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> were all dead? Fourthly, your ſelf ſay, the body of beleevers is compared to the Olive tree, and each beleever to a branch, and then, ſure <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> onely, are not the root or tree which bare the branches, but the body of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers is the tree, and ſo (by your owne grant) it followes, beleevers in one ſenſe are the tree, in another the branches. Fiftly, I adde, that the body of beleevers, who make this Olive tree and branches, muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of <hi>viſible</hi> profeſſors, and not reſtrained or limited to <hi>true</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers onely, otherwiſe the branches could not have been broken off, as is aforeſaid.</p>

ſhoot at. I have no feare that your great ſwelling words will give any ſatisfaction to your judicious Readers; wee will come to what you have done, and try what ſtrength there is in this long Section, and that I may make my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it as briefe as is poſſible, I ſhall bring all the matter of your diſcourſe to three heads. Firſt, ſuch things as wherein you and I doe agree, and muſt neceſſarily agree. Secondly ſuch things as wherein whether wee agree or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree it matters not much to the point in controverſie; theſe two I ſhall but touch upon. Thirdly, ſuch things wherein wee differ, and which really concerne the controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us. And theſe things (God willing) wee will try out hand to hand.</p>
               <p>Firſt, wee agree, that <hi>ſanctified</hi> may have many ſenſes, and that of thoſe many, two onely are applicable in this place, either the <hi>matrimoniall ſanctification,</hi> which you inſiſt upon, <hi>viz. Chaſtitie in the wife and husband, or lawfull matrimony between them, and legitimation of the children.</hi> Or elſe <hi>Inſtrumentall ſanctification, in the husband and wife, and federall holineſſe in the children,</hi> which I inſiſt upon. Wee <hi>agree</hi> alſo, ſecondly, that <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </hi> may ſignifie <hi>by</hi> as well as <hi>in.</hi> Wee further <hi>agree</hi> thirdly, that the <hi>ſeepe</hi> and meaning of the <hi>Text</hi> is, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> having writ for the Apoſtles reſolution whether it were lawfull for them who were converted, ſtill to retaine their Infidell wives or husbands; the Apoſtle here reſolves that caſe upon the affirmative. And I will further <hi>agree</hi> with you fourthly, that theſe words <hi>elſe were your Children uncleane, &amp;c.</hi> are a <hi>medium</hi> or <hi>argument</hi> whereby the Apoſtle proves the former ſentence, <hi>the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving husband is ſanctified in the wife, &amp;c.</hi> I yet further agree, fiftly, that all the places which you cite out of the learned <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chamier</hi> often cited to no purpoſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Chamier</hi> are <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and clearely prove that for which hee brings them, <hi>viz. That ſanctification cannot bee underſtood of the converſion of the unbeleever, through the diligence of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, page</hi> 73. <hi>And that the Argument is not fetched from a contingent thing, pag.</hi> 74. And <hi>that holineſſe is not meant of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall holineſſe</hi> (which ſenſe was aſcribed to <hi>Auguſtine) pag.</hi> 76. And that the <hi>holineſſe of Children here, is not that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:113537:78"/>
which they receive from their education, pag.</hi> 75. And I am ſure you muſt agree with mee, ſixtly, that in all theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies you have cited out of <hi>Chamier,</hi> there is not one word againſt my Interpretation, or for the Juſtification of yours; <note place="margin">And againſt his owne judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> yea and I know alſo that you will agree with mee ſeventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the learned <hi>Chamier</hi> in a large diſpute doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute your interpretation, and vindicate my interpretation, as the onely true and proper meaning of this Text, even in that very place where you quote him. And therefore I know the Reader will agree with mee (whether you doe or no) <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cham. Panſtrat. Cathol. Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 10.</note> that you doe but abuſe your Author and Reader, both in making a flouriſh with <hi>Chamiers</hi> name nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and thereby would make the Reader conceive <hi>Chamier</hi> to bee of your ſide when hee is point-blanke againſt you. I yet further agree with you, eighthly, that <hi>ſome Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> both <hi>antient</hi> and <hi>moderne</hi> doe interpret this Text as you doe, and I am ſure you will alſo agree that it were eaſie for mee to bring ten for one, who interpret this Text as I doe; though I forbeare to bumbaſt my booke with them, no wayes deſiring that this cauſe ſhould bee carryed by number of ſuffrages.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there are many things in this Section wherein wee differ, but the cauſe depends nothing at all upon them; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beza</hi> cited by Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> contrary to his owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> firſt, you ſeverall times cite the <hi>learned Beza</hi> as if hee were of your mind in the interpretation of this Text, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue it of <hi>matrimoniall holin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> I confeſſe the cauſe depends not upon <hi>Beza's</hi> judgement, but your reputation depends much upon making this good: That you ſhould dare to cite an author as interpreting it for you who <hi>exprofeſſo</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it againſt you; <hi>Beza</hi> indeed acknowledgeth this Text warrants a lawfull uſe, but withall ſets himſelfe to prove that that's not all, but ſaith it's ſuch a ſanctification as I contend for, and ſaith, <hi>no man may interpret it otherwiſe then I doe of federall holineſſe:</hi> according to the Covenant, <hi>Ero Deus tuu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

not upon this, but it diſcovers ſome defect in your reading, ſince it is apparent that <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> one of the moſt ancient of the Greek Fathers, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> one of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this Text for ſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall holineſſe.</note> the moſt antient of the Latine Fathers bring this Text to prove the prerogative of the Infants of beleevers, which certainly they could not have done if they had interpreted as you doe, that their children were legitimate, nor have given them any title to the kingdome of heaven, if to their underſtanding it had not related to the Covenant of Grace. Thirdly, whether Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> paralleling this place with <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15. (upon which you ſpend almoſt two whole pages) bee good or no, or whether theſe places doe interpret one another, is not much materiall to the preſent controverſie about this Text, although it be plaine, that <hi>by Jewes by n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, this therefore onely remaines to bee tryed out between us, whether this bee meant <hi>of lawfulneſſe of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock between man and wife,</hi> and <hi>legitimation of children,</hi> as you affirme; or of <hi>Inſtrumentall ſanctification,</hi> betweene husband and wife <hi>quoad hoc, and federall holineſſe of children,</hi> as I affirme; wherein I ſhall, firſt, make it plaine that your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation cannot hold; ſecondly, that mine muſt ſtand.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe which you undertake to juſtifie is, that it <hi>is a Matrimoniall ſanctification,</hi> when the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving husband is ſanctified by the wife, &amp;c.</hi> the meaning i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, you like not the term <hi>civill holineſſe,</hi> you rather would call it <hi>matrimoniall holineſſe,</hi> becauſe its inſtitution is of <hi>God,</hi> not from the laws of <hi>Man.</hi> I Reply, this is a poor ſhift; by <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>civill</hi> wee diſtinguiſh things belonging to the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Table.</hi> All <hi>ſecond Table</hi> duties are <hi>civill</hi> things, though their inſtitution be of God; <hi>civill Magiſtracy</hi> though inſtituted of God; obedience of children to their Parents, though inſtituted of God; and all the <hi>judiciall lawes</hi> given to the Jews about <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum;</hi> were they not therefore civill, becauſe they were Gods inſtitutions? Or is marriage a buſineſſe more concerning Religion, then theſe are? is it a Sacrament? or how elſe, is it more holy then theſe other civill things?</p>
               <p>You except ſecondly, <hi>uncleanneſſe</hi> may bee taken for <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardy,</hi> in an <hi>alluſion</hi> to a <hi>Tabernacle uſe: Baſtards</hi> being num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered among the <hi>uncleane.</hi> I Reply, this is ſpoken without any proof, for although the Lord ſaith, <hi>Deuteronom.</hi> 23. 2. <note place="margin">Deut. 23. 2. vindicated.</note> 
                  <hi>That a baſtard ſhall not come into the congregation of the Lord,</hi> it cannot be meant that <hi>baſtards</hi> ſhall bee numbered among the <hi>uncleane,</hi> or having nothing to doe about <hi>Tabernacle</hi> or <hi>Temple</hi> ſervices; for there was the ſame law for <hi>Eunuchs</hi> who were not excluded as <hi>unclean:</hi> no <hi>unclean</hi> perſon might eate the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> might no <hi>Eunuch</hi> or <hi>Baſtard</hi> eate the Paſſeover?

                  <hi>the meat and drink of beleevers, ſanctified to them, ſerves for a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious end and uſe, to refreſh them who are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> You anſwer, <hi>then is ſeems in eating and drinking they do an act of religion;</hi> to which I need no other reply then your next words, <hi>that they are ſanctified to them by the word and prayer,</hi> they receiving them after an holy manner, with faith, ſupplication, and thankeſgiving, &amp;c. And that this place of <hi>Timothy</hi> doth hold out more then a lawfull uſe, is moſt apparent; becauſe it is ſuch a uſe of the creatures as the heathen had not, who yet had a lawfull uſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and it is ſuch a uſe as is appliable onely to beleevers; and ſuch a uſe as is procured by the Word and prayer: and although wicked men doe not doe an act of Religion in feeding the bodies of the Saints, becauſe all their actions are uncleane; yet beleevers have an holy uſe of thoſe creatures which heathens feed them with having the Word not onely to warrant the uſe of them, but prayer to procure Gods bleſſing, to that end for which they eate and drink, which <hi>is to live unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My ſecond Argument was, had this been the meaning, <hi>Elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy; elſe had</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Arg.</hi> vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> 
                  <hi>your children bin baſtards, but now they are legitimate; the Apoſtles anſwer had not been true;</hi> becauſe then <hi>if one of the parents had not been a beleever, and ſo by being a beleever, had ſanctified the unbeleever, their children muſt have been baſtards, whereas wee know children born in lawfull wedlock are legitimate, though both the Parents were unbeleevers.</hi> To which you anſwer, <hi>this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge comes not from the faith of the beleever, but from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of marriage;</hi> and your reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith not, the unbeleever is ſanctified by the beleever;</hi> but from <hi>the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or the wife, although one or two old Copies have the word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, yet the reſt have it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the reaſon cannot be conceived rightly to be any other, but that although the perſon meant were a beleever is well as an husband or wife; yet in this paſſage they were conſidered onely as husband and wife, and not as beleevers, to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:113537:81"/>
intimate that the ſanctification did not come from the faith of the party, but from conjugall relation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, this expreſſely croſſes the Apoſtles confeſſed ſcope, for the queſtion was not, whether an husband might leave his wife, or a wife her husband, the Apoſtle had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that caſe before, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. but whether a <hi>beleeving</hi> huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band might leave or ſeparate from an <hi>unbeleever;</hi> no (ſaith the Apoſtle) if <hi>the unbeleever be content to dwell together,</hi> (if not, let them go, a brother or a ſiſter is not in bondage in ſuch a caſe) <hi>Why? for the unbeleever is ſanctified in or by the wife;</hi> but now in your ſenſe, the Argument had been as good, to ſay, the <hi>unbeleever</hi> is ſanctified in or by the <hi>unbeleever;</hi> or the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever</hi> is ſanctified in or by the <hi>unbeleever,</hi> which had beene nothing to the queſtion in hand. Againe, the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely names the unbeleever in oppoſition to the wife or husband who is a beleever; of which there had been no uſe, if he had intended onely matrimoniall ſanctification, he might have ſaid the husband is ſanctified by the wife, and the wife by the husband, let them bee what they will, which cannot be ſpoken truly, when the Scripture plainely ſayes, Nothing is pure or holy to the unbeleever, as <hi>Beza</hi> well obſerves upon this place: and though the word belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be not in the Text, [yet it is neceſſarily implyed, and therefore ſome Copies have it in the Margin, not onely one old Copy, and a Copy of <hi>Clermont,</hi> and the Vulgar Latine ſo reade it, but <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo in his book, wherein hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the Sermon on the Mount; and <hi>Tertullian</hi> in <hi>libro ſecundo ad ux<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rem,]</hi> for as <hi>Beza</hi> rightly obſerves, the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is concerning a beleever, what he is to doe with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever; and when he ſayes the unbeleeving party is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in or by the other party, it plainly implyes the one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſanctifies the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the beleever ſanctifies the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, (not <hi>retro)</hi> which needed not be ſaid of matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſanctification, as you call it, for in that ſenſe both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ſanctified in themſelves, not in or by one another, marriage being honourable among all, and the bed (the <hi>coitus)</hi> undefiled. Beſides, there are words which plainly denotate it a little before, a <hi>brother</hi> or <hi>ſiſter,</hi> which are taken
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:113537:82"/>
for beleevers, ver. 12. <hi>if a brother have an unbeleeving or infidel wife,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>a brother or a ſiſter is not in bondage in ſuch a caſe:</hi> And if you ſhould ſay the beleeving party ſanctifies the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever, not <hi>qua</hi> beleever, but by the Word and prayer I anſwer, this would make the Argument ſtronger; for it is therefore ſuch a ſanctification as heathens are not capable of.</p>
               <p>My Third Argument was, <hi>the Apoſtles argument had had no ſtrength in it, ſuppoſing the text were to be interpreted as theſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 3. vindicated.</note> 
                  <hi>men would have it: their doubt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>was, their marriage was an unlawfull wedlock; and ſo conſequently their children ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards; and they make the Apoſtles anſwer to be, were you not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man and wife, your children were baſtards: which kinde of Argument</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>were but idem per idem.</hi> Your anſwer to this is ſuch a one as I know not what to make of it; you ſay <hi>I doe not rightly ſet downe my Adverſaries explication of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, the doubt</hi> (ſay you) <hi>was onely, whether they might live in conjugall uſe; but there was no queſtion of their children, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were legitimate or not; they were aſſured their children were not baſtards, but legitimate, and this the Apoſtle uſes as his</hi> medium, <hi>to prove they might lawfully live together.</hi> To which I Reply, take this for granted which you ſay, and (if I want not common ſenſe) you plainely and fully anſwer your ſelfe, for if they were out of all doubt, that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were not baſtards, then it was not poſſible for them to doubt whether their owne marriage were lawfull; take this to be his Argument, your children are legitimate, this you all grant: <hi>Ergo,</hi> your marriage is lawfull, of which you doubt: <hi>Riſum teneatis amici?</hi> they received the one as a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed principle, that their children were lawfully begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which could not be but in a lawfull wedlock, yet had not light enough to know, that their wedlock was a lawfull wedlock; if they doubted not of the latter, how could they of the former?</p>
               <p>My Fourth Argument was <hi>according to this interpretation, the Apoſtles anſwer could no way have reached to the qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>their conſciences; their doubt was, whether they were not to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their wives and children as not belonging to God, as being a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:113537:82"/>
ſeed whom God would not owne among his people, and this anſwer could never have quieted their conſciences, to tell them their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was lawfull, and their children legitimate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which you anſwer, <hi>this Argument is grounded on a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, the queſtion was not</hi> (ſay you) <hi>about putting away of their Wives and children as not belonging to God, but ſomething elſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Reply, but if it be not grounded upon a miſtake, and that (as <hi>Beza</hi> ſayes,) <hi>Paut is not here arguing about civill policy, but arguing a caſe of conſcience.</hi> Whether becauſe of the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the wife or husband, Religion did not require they ſhould be put away, becauſe God would not have his holy ſeed mingled with them, then by your owne confeſſion the Argument ſtands good; which whether it will not be made out, ſhall (God willing) by and by appeare.</p>
               <p>Theſe foure Arguments I uſed before; and whether the firſt three be not already vindicated, let the Reader judge; the fourth comes to be made good afterward, when I come to confirme the interpretation which I made of it. I ſhall briefly adde foure other Arguments, to ſhew that this Text cannot be interpreted as you would have it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you ſay, <hi>The unbeleeving husband is ſanctified by the wife,</hi> and ſanctification you here take for <hi>chaſtity:</hi> which is <note place="margin">5 <hi>Arg.</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</note> a moſt incongruous ſpeech, to ſay that the one party makes the other chaſte; if he or ſhe were not unchaſt, how are they made chaſte by the husband or wife? and if they bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſte, how doth this make them chaſte? marriage is then honourable or chaſte when the bed is undefiled: this Argument is onely from the unſeemlineſſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, my ſecond I take from your own words, <hi>pag.</hi> 73. Where you ſay, <hi>The ſanctification of the unbeleever here,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6 <hi>Argument.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>is ſuch a ſanctification as is parallel with that,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 5. <hi>where the creatures are ſanctified to the pure by the word and prayer;</hi> therefore there muſt be more meant then the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens are capable of; therefore another ſanctification then matrimoniall ſanctification, for that the heathens had: if therefore this muſt be ſuch a ſanctification as that place in <hi>Timothy</hi> meanes, it muſt be a ſanctification peculiar onely to beleevers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:113537:83"/>
Thirdly, yet a third Argument I take from your owne words: you have endeavoured (though in vaine) to ſhew <note place="margin">7 <hi>Argument.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>baſtards</hi> may be called <hi>uncleane,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> may be called <hi>chaſte;</hi> but you doe not, and I beleeve you cannot produce out of the Scripture the leaſt ſhew of a proofe, that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſignifies <hi>legitimation;</hi> you are <hi>holy,</hi> id eſt, <hi>you are lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten;</hi> if you can, pray let us have it in the next: ſure I am, that place, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>That man might ſeeke a holy ſeed,</hi> or rather, <hi>a ſeed of God,</hi> will give you no help; for though <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. expounded and vindicated.</note> 
                  <hi>a ſeed of God</hi> in that place, might be interpreted (as M. <hi>Calvin</hi> would have it) for <hi>legitimate,</hi> becauſe (as he ſayes) that uſes to be called Divine, which is excellent, a legitimate ſeed is in compariſon of ſpurious, yet this is nothing to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The word in the Hebrew there uſed, is not a holy ſeed, but a ſeed of God, an eminent or an excellent ſeed, as all eminent or notable things uſe to be called; great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are called the Armies of <hi>God;</hi> great and high hills, are called the hills of <hi>God;</hi> great and tall trees, are called the trees of <hi>God:</hi> ſo that take a ſeed of God in that place for a legitimate ſeed, yet there is nothing to prove that holineſſe may ſignifie legitimation; though for my owne part <hi>(Pace tanti viri)</hi> I humbly conceive the Prophet intended, not a legitimate ſeed onely, (as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> would have it) but to ſhew what was Gods chiefe end in the inſtitution of marriage, <hi>viz.</hi> The continuance of a ſeed of God, wherein the Church is to be propagated to the end of the world; now according to your interpretation of holineſſe for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, the Apoſtles Argument muſt run thus, <hi>If your marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age were not lawfull, your children would be baſtards, but now they are chaſt;</hi> which ſenſe were too ridiculous which to avoid you are compelled in ſtead of chaſte to ſay legitimate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any example of ſuch a uſe of the word <hi>holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, yet one Argument more I propound, your ſenſe <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Argument.</hi>
                  </note> makes the Apoſtles Argument wholly inconſequent, if the unbeleeving party were not ſanctified by the beleever, <hi>(viz.</hi> matrimonially) then were your children unclean, that is, (in your ſenſe) Baſtards, which follows not; for if they were both unbeleevers, yet their children were not baſtards;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:113537:83"/>
and if they were both chaſt, (yet being Infidells) their children were uncleane, <hi>id eſt,</hi> Infidells and Pagans, ſo that to cloſe this I retort your owne words, page the 75. That <hi>let this be granted (that it is meant of matrimoniall ſanctification, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of neceſſitie it muſt) then the uncleaneneſſe muſt bee meant of Baſtardy, and holineſſe of Legitimation;</hi> but I ſay, <hi>é centra,</hi> let this bee granted, (as of neceſſitie it muſt) that it is not meant of matrimoniall ſanctification, or lawfulneſſe of wedlock, then uncleanneſſe muſt not bee meant of Baſtardy, nor holineſſe of Legitimation, but of ſome other holineſſe, which what it is, is next to be enquired.</p>
               <p>Having thus plainely overthrowne your interpretation, it remaines that I make good my interpretation againſt <note place="margin">The true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated from Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> exceptions. 1. Exception.</note> your exceptions, I ſaid, <hi>their doubt ſeemes to ariſe from the Law of God, which was in force in Ezraes time, where Gods people were ordered to put away their Infidell wives and children, as a polluted ſeed, which God would not have mingled with his owne:</hi> you anſwer, firſt, <hi>You ſee very little agreement, betweene this caſe and that; and that the caſes are very farre different of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not under the Law marrying in unbeleefe, and of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under the Law, the one a Iew by profeſſion, the other a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>and that none of the phraſes, except the word (holy), are uſed in the one place which are not uſed in the other;</hi> thirdly, <hi>you rather thinke their doubt aroſe from a former Epiſtle which hee had wrote to them, mentioned</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>wherein he commanded them not to keep company with fornicators, or Idolaters, thereupon they might doubt whether they ſhould continue with their unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving yoke fellowes</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, firſt, that the caſes were the very ſame when their ſcruple aroſe, for though they were both unbeleevers when they were married, and at that time neither of them both belonged to the Church of God, yet when one of them was converted, and the other remained an Infidell, one of them was now become a Church-member, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained an alien, their caſe was the very ſame, and they finding their condition parallell with that in <hi>Ezra</hi> might very well apply that caſe to themſelves, and make this their doubt. Secondly, although <hi>the phraſes uſed in Ezra differ</hi> from thoſe uſed here, that makes nothing againſt this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:113537:84"/>
becauſe phraſes are uſed according to the different adminiſtrations, each ſpeaking according to the received dialect belonging to the adminiſtration they lived under. Thirdly, and as to that, you ſay that it might ariſe from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9. I anſwer, ſhould that be granted, yet my ſenſe remaines as ſtrong as before, for if this ſcruple now roſe, that if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers becauſe of the unbeleefe or Infidell condition of the husband or wife, might not by the rule of the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in marriage ſocietie with them, it muſt bee from ſome rule of Religion, which muſt ſtrike upon their conſcience, and from what rule could they gather, that their marriage which before was lawfull was upon their converſion turned into fornication? and if their doubt were (as your ſelfe grant) whether it were lawfull for a converted party, or a beleever ſtill to retaine their Infidell wife or husband, (not of unbeleevers whether they bee ſanctifyed matrimonially one to another) the doubt muſt neceſſarily ariſe from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Religion, ſome caſe which was peculiar to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, now (as Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> ſaies truely) the doubt being in their conſciences, of an unlawfulneſſe to continue in their married condition from ſome thing peculiar to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Apoſtle ſhould have uſed a moſt indirect argument to pacifie their conſciences in referring them to the civill Lawes of other nations, by which their marriage is proved lawfull; and to what purpoſe ſhould hee diſcourſe of Baſtards or the like, when their conſciences were ſcrupled in ſomething which begun to concerne them upon their converſion, and to tell them they were ſanctified in their unbeleefe, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have reacht the ſcruple ariſing, after they begun to bee beleevers, becauſe their marriage might be firme and good, while they remained unbeleevers; yet the Infidell might now become impure in that relation of marriage to the other, which was converted. And therefore it remaines, that it muſt bee reſolved from ſome rule which muſt reach beleevers, as they were the people of God, and not bee common to Infidels with them; now what is that Argument which <hi>Paul</hi> here uſes to ſatisfie them? (which muſt reach them as they were beleevers) your ſelfe grant it is this, <hi>elſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:113537:84"/>
were your children uncleane, which is the medium, becauſe your children are not uncleane but holy, therefore the unbeleever muſt bee granted to bee ſanctified to the wife or husband,</hi> this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt therefore neceſſarily inferre ſome kind of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is appliable onely to the State of Religion, therefore it muſt be federall holineſſe.</p>
               <p>But againſt this you except many things. Firſt, <hi>this could not have reſolved the doubt in the caſe of thoſe who by Age could</hi>

               <p>Firſt, Circumciſion is the ſame with Baptiſme for the ſpirituall part; Circumciſion was the ſeale of the <hi>new birth, Deut.</hi> 30. 6. ſo <hi>Baptiſme, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.

But Sir, this exception of yours is ſo farre from being any argument againſt mee, that it affords me a good argument for Infant-Baptiſme, becauſe the ſame authors, which mention this as an Eccleſiaſticall rite, in admiſſion of Proſelytes, doe teſtifie that the Infants of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes were baptized as well as circumciſed, and whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Circumciſion was applyed, Baptiſme went along with it, ſo that the uſe of Baptiſme was the ſame before, <hi>viz.</hi> to bee a rite of admitting growne men and Infants into the Church, onely it begun to bee a Sacrament of divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, when <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſent to Baptize into the name of Chriſt: and it is in this Sacrament as in the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, the <hi>panis benedictus,</hi> and the cup were uſed before in the Sacrament of the Paſſeover, as an Eccleſiaſticall rite, but our Lord at the laſt Paſſeover, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the bread and wine to bee <hi>Sacramentall</hi> Elements, which before were only an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> rite; now ſeeing that Baptiſme which was in uſe before, was onely turned into a Sacramentall uſe, to ſucceed Circumciſion, with whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a concomitant, and alwayes applyed to the ſame perſons. Have you not helped us to a good Argument, that Baptiſme belongs to Infants as well as grown men, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince there is not the leaſt hint given in the Word, that when it was thus advanced to bee a Sacrament, it ſhould not bee applyed to thoſe perſons to whom before it was, <hi>viz.</hi> Infants as well as growne men? the truth of this, that it <note place="margin">Proved from Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, but you goe on and ſay, <hi>That in truth it would evacuate the Apoſtles argument uſed both here, and</hi> Hebr. 9. 11. 9-13. <hi>who ſtill proves the abolition of the ceremonies of the Law, becauſe we are compleat in Christ; not in ſome new ordinances added in ſtead of them; for if there bee need of other Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (beſides Christ) in ſtead of the old, then Christ himſelf hath not fulneſſe enough, and though our Ordinances may bee ſaid to imitate theirs; yet Christ onely ſucceeds them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, it is very true, that whoever ſhould plead that we have any of our compleatneſs in any outward Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would evacuate the Apoſtles Argument But Sir, is there no diſtinction to be made betwixt <hi>our compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:113537:93"/>
hinder, or argue that all our compleatneſſe in not in Chriſt. I adde further, that Chriſt onely ſucceeds all the Jewiſh or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as the body ſucceeds the ſhadow: we plead not as the Papiſts doe, that the Jewiſh Sacraments were types of ours, they were types onely of Chriſt; but yet ours ſucceed them to be like ſignes of the Covenant of grace, and ſo the Apoſtle doth in this place.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſay you, <hi>I deny not but there is an analogy betwixt</hi>

                  <hi>baptiſme and circumciſion, as there is alſo betwixt the Arke and Baptiſme; but we are not to conclude thence, that Baptiſme ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the room and uſe of Noahs Arke, &amp;c. for in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of an Ordinance, we are not to bee ruled by bare analogie framed by our ſelves, or delivered by the Spirit of God, but by the inſtitution of God.</hi> I anſwer, but when thoſe analogies fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Spirit of God, are agreeable to the uſe and end of Gods inſtitution, we are to bee ruled by them; and the Apoſtle ſhews that's our caſe here.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſay you, <hi>The Apoſtle in this place rather reſembles buriall to circumciſion then baptiſme: and ſo makes the analogie between circumciſion and Chriſts buriall;</hi> and you bring in <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome and Theophylact concurring with you.</hi> I anſwer, this I wonder at, where is Circumciſion compared to buriall, and wherein I pray you lyes the analogie between them?

               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, ſay you, <hi>Circumciſion was not onely a priviledge to the Jews, but it was alſo a buriben to them, and it would be a bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>not a priviledge, to have an ordinance in the roome and uſe of it.</hi> I anſwer, Circumciſion was a burthen, as it was a painfull Sacrament, and as it obliged them to that painfull, coſtly and burthenſome manner of the adminiſtration of the Covenant, which was before Chriſts incarnation; but
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:113537:94"/>
it was no burden, But a great priviledge, as it was a ſeale of the Covenant. And in this laſt reſpect onely is baptiſm ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted into his room and place.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of this Section, I like your farewell, though you tell me, <hi>I ſpeake with more confidence then truth; I ſaid</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his reaſon, why baptiſm is there named, confirmes my interpretation.</note> 
                  <hi>there had been no reaſon to have named baptiſme, but that he meant to ſhew baptiſme was now to Chriſtians in the room of circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Jewes:</hi> You ſay, <hi>baptiſme is named, becauſe it is one of the meanes by which Chriſtians come to have communion with Chriſt, and to be compleat in him; which was the thing the Apoſtle intended in the</hi> 12. verſe. <hi>And therefore faith is joyned with it, they being the two ſpeciall means whereby we have our communion with Chriſt, to which you adde, Gal.</hi> 5. 25, 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, &amp; 4. But is not this the ſame ſenſe with mine, who have hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to juſtifie that, though our compleatneſſe be in Chriſt onely, who is now exhibited, and no longer to bee ſought in the types and ſhadows of the Jewiſh adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (to which manner of adminiſtrations Circumciſion did oblige them;) yet Baptiſm is now the ſeal of our initiation, and a meanes to apply this Covenant to us, as Circumciſion was to them, though the manner of their adminiſtration be wholly ceaſed. If I have not taken you right, make a ſyllogiſme, and make all Logick quake before your mighty conſequence. Baptiſme is named, becauſe it is one of the meanes of Chriſtians being exempted from the Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and come to be ingraffed into Chriſt, and to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in him; therefore it doth not ſucceed in the roome and place of Circumciſion: nay, rather, it therefore doth. I pray you put together theſe words, <hi>Ye are compleat in Chriſt, in whom ye are alſo circumciſed, being buryed with him in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme;</hi> and ſee if it ſpeake not this plainely, that baptiſme ſucceeds into the uſe of Circumciſion: ſurely, it hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares Circumciſion and Baptiſme are nearer of kin then you would make them.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of this Section, according to your wonted manner, you triumph, and tell me that you have at <hi>laſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through this concluſion, and the text,</hi> Col. 2. 12. &amp; 10. <hi>the miſunderſtanding of which hath been the</hi> ignis faruis, <hi>fooliſh fire,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:113537:94"/>
which hath led men out of the way in this matter, into bags.</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sir, were theſe ſcorns of being led by fooliſh fire into bogs, &amp;c caſt upon my ſelfe onely, it were nothing; but when they are thus caſt in the faces of all Divines, ancient, and modern, all Harmonies and Confeſſions (except onely a handfull of upſtart Anabaptiſts) as if they were all ſuch ſimple ones, that an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> a fooles fire, might lead them into any bogs, I can hardly forbeare to tell you it is an argument of an arrogant Spirit.</p>
               <p>There is alſo in the end of your booke, a ſhort diſcourſe <note place="margin">The deſcant of Mr. <hi>Tomber</hi> upon this Text at the end of his book brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined.</note> upon this Text, which I read over to ſee if there were any thing which might weaken my Argument, or ſtrengthen your exceptions; but in it I finde not any one ſentence that hurts me, or helps you; only ſome of thoſe things which you call dictates, bold aſſertions, ſome of them contrary to the plain Text of Scripture, all of them magiſterially ſet down with out proof: as, <hi>circumciſion was not a token of the Covenant to the Iews children;</hi> which is contrary to the very Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>That the promiſes of the Covenant, were not the reaſon that they were circumciſed.</hi> Yet any Reader may ſee that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is there ſet downe as the reaſon why they ſhould bee circumciſed.

               <p>Hitherto I have followed you foot by foot, becauſe the gaining or loſing the cauſe, depends upon theſe former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, <hi>the ſameneſſe of the Covenant</hi> both to Jews and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, the <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:113537:95"/>
My fourth Concluſion <hi>was, That by Gods owne expreſſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Infants as well as growne men, were in the time of the Iewes to be initiated and ſealed with the ſigne of circumciſion, whether Jews by nature, or Proſelytes of the Gentiles, one law was for them all, if they receive the covenant, they and their children were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Concluſion you grant to be true; onely, becauſe you wil ſay ſomewhat to every thing: you anſwer, Firſt, <hi>That it is</hi>

                  <hi>as certain that this expreſſe order of God is now repealed;</hi> very true, and you might have added, That by his order likewiſe, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ſucceeds in the room of it.

                  <note place="margin">Why Infants of Jewes were circumciſed.</note> 
                  <hi>it was not as a ſeale of the ſpirituall part of the Covenant, but as a Nationall badge, or ſeale of ſome temporall and earthly bleſſings and priviledges, as of the right to the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>&amp;c. and that</hi> Iſhmael, <hi>though he was circumciſed for ſome temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, was not thereby brought under the Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> You anſwer, <hi>they who thus object, ſpeake the truth:</hi> and here you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to your Latine Paper. I reply, to my underſtanding, you here ſpeake pure Anabaptiſme indeed, juſt like the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts in <hi>Germany,</hi> who ſay, <hi>The Covenant which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion ſealed, was a carnall covenant:</hi> and <hi>that when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Iſraelites to circumciſe their children, wee are not to underſtand that he obliged them to have their hearts circumciſed, nor aimed at any thing which touched the inward man; that the condition required by God in circumciſion, cannot bee drawne to a ſpirituall buſineſſe; that the circumciſed by circumciſion, were not bound to looke for ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> how very neare are you come to theſe carnall conceits of the <hi>German</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, which have been a thouſand times confuted by our Orthodox Divines? yet you bring not one ſhadow of a proofe for what you ſay, onely you alledge, <hi>Iſhmael had no part in the covenant, the cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nant was to bee eſtabliſted with Iſaac, and not with Iſhmael, &amp;c.</hi> But I have made it abundantly cleare, that not onely <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> but miſſions of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> ſeed, did never partake of the ſpirituall graces of the Covenant, yet were reckoned by circumciſion to belong to the Covenant, and were obliged to ſeeke after the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:113537:95"/>
part of it, and whereas you ſay, <hi>when Iſhmael was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, Abraham underſtood the promiſe was not intended for Iſhmael but for Iſaac, that Iſhmael onely was to have a ſhare in ſome temporall bleſſings;</hi> I anſwer, ſuppoſing that were true, you have given a very good inſtance to prove that ſome may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the outward ſigne of the Covenant, and have a viſible ſtanding in the Church, though hee who adminiſters the Seale, might by revelation know that the inward grace is wanting. Secondly, I anſwer, how doe you prove that no part of the ſpirituall Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to belong to <hi>Iſhmael</hi> when he was circumciſed, or not to <hi>Eſau</hi> when hee was circumciſed? God indeed did then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was he in whoſe family the Covenant ſhould continue, but not a word that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſhould have no part in it: prove (if you can) in your next that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were not by their circumciſion bound to have their hearts circumciſed, and to beleeve in the Meſſiah that was to come of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. And whereas you ſay, againe and againe, <hi>that no benefit of the Covenant was the proper reaſon why theſe or thoſe were circumciſed, but onely Gods precept:</hi> I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cleared it out of the Text <hi>Geneſis</hi> 17. that though Gods command was the cauſe of the exiſtence of the dutie of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, yet the Covenant of grace was the motive to it, and theſe two are well conſiſtent together.</p>

                  <hi>But what is all this,</hi> ſay you, <hi>to the anſwering of the objection, which was, that Circumciſion was not the Seale of the ſpirituall part of the Covenant of grace, to all circumciſed perſons, and that Circumciſion was appointed to perſons not under the Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, I thinke it very fully anſwers the objection, for if it was commanded and obſerved, as that which was a priviledge and dutie belonging to the Covenant, and they uſed it as being in Covenant, the objection is wholly taken off. Your frequent bringing in of the manner of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, by types, ſhadowes, &amp;c. hath been abundantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in my vindicating my firſt concluſion, and elſewhere. Next you much trouble your ſelfe, how <hi>I will cleare that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of mens conformity to temporall bleſſings and puniſhments, becauſe bleſſings and puniſhments are Gods acts and not mens:</hi> I deſire you to require an account of it from them who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it, I ſaid, <hi>Circumciſion bound them who received it to conforme to that manner of adminiſtration of the Covenant which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried much by a way of temporall bleſſings and puniſhments, they being types of ſpirituall things:</hi> is this all one to conforme to temporall bleſſings and puniſhments? I added, <hi>no man can ſhew, that any were to receive Circumciſion in relation to theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things onely, or to them at all, further then they were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of the Covenant of grace;</hi> you anſwer, <hi>they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Circumciſion neither in relation to theſe outward things onely no nor at all, either as they were temporall bleſſings or types of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi>

                  <hi>things, and ſo adminiſtrations of the Covenant of grace, but for this reaſon and no other, becauſe God had ſo commanded;</hi> I reply, here had beene the fit place for you to have made good what you have ſo confidently aſſerted heretofore; that <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> and others were circumciſed for ſome temporall reſpects, that Circumciſion ſealed the temporall or politicall promiſes, &amp;c. but in ſtead of proving this, you doe here as good as deny it, for if they were not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in any reſpect at all to their temporall bleſſings, how I pray you did Circumciſion ſeale their temporall bleſſings? Nay further, you by conſequent deny that Circumciſion ſealed either temporall or ſpirituall bleſſings, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it was no ſeale at all, or a ſeale of nothing at all;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:113537:97"/>
for if they were circumciſed with reſpect to nothing, but onely becauſe God commanded them to bee circumciſed, how was Circumciſion any Seale to them? If a father give a child a Ring, and command him to weare it, onely to ſhew his obedience to his fathers command, what doth the wearing of this Ring ſeale to the child? it declares indeed the childes obedience to the father, but ſeals nothing to the child from the father. Nor doth that which you adde any whit helpe this, you ſay, <hi>You deny not that circumciſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were by faith to looke on the covenant of grace, through theſe adminiſtrations,</hi> but by what warrant could their faith look upon the Covenant of grace through circumciſion if the command of circumciſion were not in reference to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace? I profeſſe I cannot underſtand it, nor doe I thinke it poſſible for you, to reconcile this, either with the conſtant doctrine of the Scripture concerning the end and uſe of Circumciſion, or with your owne grant, that Circumciſion was the initiall Seale of the Jewes Covenant with God.</p>
               <p>To cleare it further that Circumciſion was not a ſeale of the land of Canaan, or the temporall bleſſings of it, I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the Proſelytes and their children could not bee circumciſed in relation to Canaan, &amp;c. becauſe they were not capable of any inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance there; yea, that it tied them to a greater expence of their temporall bleſſings by their long, frequent, and chargeable journies to worſhip at Ieruſalem;</hi> you anſwer onely this, <hi>all this may bee granted, yet this overthrowes not this propoſition, that the Covenant made with Abraham had promiſes of temporall bleſſings, and that ſome were to be circumciſed who had no part in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace:</hi> but Sir, the thing I am here proving is that Circumciſion was no Seale of the land of Canaan, not that there were no temporall bleſſings belonging to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; I know the promiſes of temporall bleſſings belong to the Covenant of grace, as well as the promiſes of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; <hi>godlineſſe having the promiſe of this life, and of that which is to come:</hi> nor was I proving that all who were to bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed had part in the ſpirituall graces of the Covenant, my drift being onely to prove, that all who were to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:113537:97"/>
had a viſible memberſhip and right to bee reputed as belonging to the Church, againſt which in this place you ſay juſt nothing.

               <p>The fifth and laſt concluſion which I laid downe in my <note place="margin">5 Concluſion vindicated, our priviledges nor ſtraitned but inlarged.</note> Sermon was this, <hi>the priviledges of beleevers under this laſt and beſt adminiſtration of the covenant of grace are many wayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, made more honorable and comfortable then ever they were in the time of the Iewes adminiſtration; many Scriptures ſpeake of their inlargement, not one for the dimininiſhing or extenuating of them;</hi> I could hardly have imagined that you could have ſpent ten or eleven whole pages in excepting againſt this, I ſhall very briefely examine what you have ſaid; firſt, you ſhew your skill in the deſcription of a priviledge out of the civill Law, and I concurre with you, <hi>that a priviledge muſt bee ſomewhat which is a benefit,</hi> and that <hi>the ſame thing may bee a priviledge at one time, which is not at another;</hi> that <hi>that may bee a priviledge in compariſon of the heathens which is not in compariſon of Chriſtians:</hi> but what's all this to the purpoſe? further ſay you, <hi>the priviledges of the covenant of grace belonging to the ſubſtance of it, are not now more enlarged or more honorable or comfortable then they were in the time of the Iewes;</hi> I anſwer,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:113537:98"/>
firſt, though this were granted it hurts not mee, it's ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if the adminiſtration be now more comfortable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers and their children. Secondly, if there be no more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norableneſſe in thoſe priviledges which belong to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Covenant, how comes it to paſſe, that in your anſwers to thoſe ſeverall texts which I and others bring to <note place="margin">Our ſpirituall priviledges how inlarged.</note> prove the enlargement of priviledges under this laſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, you interpret them of thoſe priviledges which belong to the ſubſtance of the Covenant or the ſpirituall part of it? Thirdly, though I willingly acknowledge that the ſpirituall priviledges are the ſame both to the Jewes and Gentiles, the ſame under both adminiſtrations, yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that under this laſt adminiſtration, theſe priviledges are communicated not onely with more cleareneſſe, but in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure and abundance, floods in ſtead of drops: wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes made like <hi>Lebanon</hi> and <hi>Sharon,</hi> I wonder you ſhould ſay they are no more honorable and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble now then they were then; is not abundance of grace more honorable and comfortable then a little grace? But ſay you, <hi>in reſpect of the adminiſtration it is granted they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes enlarged and made more honorable:</hi> this will ſerve our turne well enough, for this was a priviledge belonging to their adminiſtration, that their Infants were under it as well as themſelves; yeeld that for ours, and the controverſie is ended, <hi>wee</hi> (ſay I) <hi>are freed from that hard and coſtly yoake of their way of adminiſtration: true</hi> ſay you, <hi>it is not onely our priviledge to bee free from that, but it is our priviledge alſo to have nothing in lieu of that yoake.</hi> To have nothing in lieu of them as they were ſhadowes of the ſubſtance, which is Chriſt, is very right, but to ſay it is our priviledge to have nothing in lieu of them, as they were externall Ordinances to apply Chriſt, is to ſay it is our priviledge to have no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to apply Chriſt to us, and thereby to make us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in him, which were a moſt abſurd thing to affirme. Whereas I added <hi>that our priviledges for our ſelves and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are at leaſt as honorable, large, and comfortable as theirs,</hi> your anſwer to this is very remarkable, but whether with an obeliske or aſteriske the Reader ſhall judge; firſt ſay you,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:113537:98"/>
                  <hi>circumciſion belongs to the adminiſtration of the Covenant, not to the ſubſtance of it.</hi> I reply; it was indeed a part of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and obliged them to the reſt of that manner of adminiſtration, as Baptiſme now doth to ours, but did it not alſo belong to the ſubſtance? was it not a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, of circumciſion of heart, &amp;c. doth not the ſeale belong to the thing ſealed? the conveyance and ſeal annexed to it, are no part of the purchaſed inheritance, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> makes it a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge not to have Infants baptized.</note> but doe they not belong to it? Secondly, your next is as remarkable, <hi>viz. That it's ſo farre from being a priviledge to our children to have them baptized; to have Baptiſme ſucceed in the ſtead of Circumeiſion, that it is a benefit to want it, God not having appointed it.</hi> I anſwer, then belike our priviledges of the Covenant of grace are ſo farre from being inlarged by enjoying the Sacrament of Baptiſme, that it had been our priviledge to have wanted Baptiſme if God had not appointed it; and by as good a reaſon at leaſt, you might have ſaid, that Circumciſion was ſo farre from being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to the Jews and their children, that it had been a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit for them to have wanted it, if God had not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it; ſure, that is a ſtrange kinde of priviledge, of which I may truly ſay, that it had been a greater benefit to them who have it, to have wanted it, if the Donor had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it.</p>
               <p>Next, you come more particularly to examine the proofs of my Concluſion; and (ſay you) <hi>the thing I ſhould prove, is one of theſe two, either that circumciſion did belong to the ſubſtance of the Covenant of grace: or that the want of circumciſion, or ſome Ordinance in the place and uſe of it, is a loſſe of priviledge of the Covenant of grace to us and our children.</hi> Sir, the thing I was to prove was this 5 Concluſion, <hi>viz. That our priviledges are inlarged, not extenuated:</hi> and as for theſe two particulars, I have already proved, that Circumciſion, though a part of their adminiſtration, did yet belong to the ſubſtance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it I ſay, not as a part of it, but as a meanes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it. And I have alſo proved, that though it be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to have nothing ſucceed circumciſion, as it bound to that manner of adminiſtration; yet it is a priviledge to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:113537:99"/>
have ſomewhat ſucceed it as a ſeale of the Covenant, in as much as a Covenant with a ſeale, is a greater benefit then a Covenant without a ſeale. More particularly, I ſaid our <note place="margin">Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> makes the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8 to bee the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</note> enlargement of priviledges appeares, partly, in that wee have freedome, in what was burthenſome to them in their manner of adminiſtration; partly, becauſe our Covenant is eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. Whereupon you enter upon a Diſcourſe of that Covenant there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and you poſitively aſſert, <hi>That it was the Covenant of workes.</hi> Alaſſe Sir, why doe you run into this needleſſe and erroneous digreſſion? I ſaid indeed in my Sermon, that the morall Law was added foure hundred and thirty yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> not as a part of that Covenant, but as a Schoolemaſter to whip them to Chriſt; that they finding the impoſſibility of keeping the Law, might more earneſtly long after Chriſt, exhibited in thoſe ſhadows of Rites and Sacrifices, &amp;c. but to ſay that this Covenant mentioned in the eight of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> was the Covenant of works, is a moſt erroneous doctrine; look into the Text, and you ſhall find that the Covenant which is there mentioned, (which God finds fault with, and calls the <hi>firſt</hi> Covenant; in oppoſition to this <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Sir, was this the Covenant of works? I hope you will not own it in your next. Next you ſay, That place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>the glory of</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>theirs, bad no glory in reſpect of ours: This is not meant of the Covenant of grace, but of the Covenant in Mount</hi> Sinai; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore impertinently alledged by me.</hi> Sir, I wonder at your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in it; the Reader will eaſily diſcorne that the whole ſcope of that Chapter clearly holds forth the preheminence of the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, above the Miniſtery of <hi>Moſes</hi> his vailed Ceremonies: belike then with you, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Ceremonies were the Covenant of works. Next, I ſhewed in my Sermon, that as our priviledges are better then theirs, in being free'd from their burthens, <hi>ſo we as well as they, enjoy the honour of being called a holy Nation, a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:113537:99"/>
a choſen generation, &amp;c.</hi> Vpon this you diſcourſe at large, eſpecially againſt Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and you undertake to prove that all theſe things are meant of the inviſible Church. I anſwer very briefly, none of us ever doubted, but that the ſpirituall part belongs onely to the inviſible Church, and did ſo in the time of the Jews, as well as now; but yet we as well as the Jews partake of that priviledge, and our viſible ſtanding gives us the honor to be ſo reputed, as wel as theirs gave it unto them; and were all the Jews who had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to bee called a holy Nation, really ſuch? were they all inwardly holy, or effectually called? the like anſwer ſerves to your diſcourſe upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. the Apoſtle ſpeakes there of adoption as a priviledge of the body of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their whole Nation had the Honour to bee called the children of God, according to <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Ye are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Lord your God,</hi> yet they were not all the ſpirituall children of God; the Reader may ſee more of this in the vindication of my ſecond Concluſion, and you ſhall doe well in your next, ſolidly to prove that theſe were not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which the <hi>viſible Church</hi> of the Jewes enjoyed (though many among them had the kernell without the ſhell) rather then thus to triumph in theſe fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exceptions. I added, <hi>Wee have all theſe things with advantage, not onely in the clearneſſe of the adminiſtration, but in ſome ſenſe, in greater extent to perſons, with us there is neither male nor female.</hi> Why I adde this of male or female, you ſay you know not, except I meane to inſinuate that in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church there was male and female, becauſe Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was onely of the males, &amp;c. I reply, I acknowledge that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27, 28. opened.</note> though it bee true, that among true beleevers, among the Jews there was neither male nor female, all equally did partake of the ſpirituall part of the Covenant, as well as now with us, yet for the comfortable manner of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it, even this diſtinction of male and female, is a priviledge enla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ged under this laſt and beſt adminiſtration, and the Apoſtle in that place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28. doth plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate the enlargement of this priviledge in this reſpect, and ſo I think the words plainly hold out, <hi>As many of you as have
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:113537:100"/>
been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt; there is neither Iew nor Greeke, bond nor free, made nor female, for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus; and if ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams ſeed, and heires according to promiſe.</hi> To me the Apoſtle here doth plainly hold out, that now under the New Teſtament, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is the viſible pledge of our being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, as circumciſion was the pledge of it under the Old Teſtament; &amp; that here is the enlargement of our priviledge in the New Teſtament, that whereas Circumciſion of old was applyed to one Nation, and not to others; now out of all Nations, ſuch are called in, as are made <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, whether Jew or Greek. And whereas of old the ſeale was apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely to the <hi>males,</hi> in this reſpect the differences of ſexes is now taken away. And although it be true that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall part of all this be made good onely to true beleevers, who likewiſe alone have the inward baptiſme, yet viſible profeſſors enjoy the viſible priviledge.</p>
               <p>Next you proceed to reply to an Objection which I propounded in my Sermon, and anſwered, <hi>(viz.) In ſome thing's the Jews had greater priviledges then we have; as that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham had the priviledge to bee called the Father of the faithfull: that Chriſt ſhould be born of his fleſh; the Virgin Mary had the priviledge to be the Mother of Chriſt; the whole Nation of the Jews had this priviledge, that God will call in their ſeed againe, after they had been caſt off for unbelief many hundred years; which priviledges none of the Gentiles have, or can have.</hi> And my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, <hi>That our queſtion is about ſuch priviledges as belong to all who have a ſtanding under the Covenant, which every one who is in covenant with God might expect by vertue of the covenant, whether hee were a Jew or a Proſelyte, not for any peculiar or perſonall priviledge to any one man or woman, or family, or Tribe. That it no ways derogates from us that ſome particular perſon or Tribe ſhould enjoy ſome peculiar priviledges; but if any of the common priviledges, which they all enjoyed by vertue of their Church ſtanding ſhould be abridged, then the priviledges of the New Teſtament would bee more reſtrained then thoſe of the Old;</hi> this, ſaid I, is againſt the word of God. Your anſwer is, <hi>That this Argument hath no weight, but onely amongſt Vulgar, and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllogiſing
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:113537:100"/>
capacities: and therefore in your Latine Paper you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe inſtances of the Virgin Mary, &amp;c.</hi> And thence would ſhew, <hi>That the Iews might have more priviledges in ſome reſpect, in ſome things, then we, and yet our condition better then theirs by reaſon of ſome other priviledges we have above them, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the defect of thoſe priviledges;</hi> and therefore <hi>no good Argument can be drawne, That becauſe God gave ſuch a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the Jews, therefore we muſt have ſuch a priviledge too; yea, it would bee an Argument of arrogant preſumption, to ſay, the Iews had ſuch a priviledge, therefore we muſt have it: They had a priviledge to circumciſe Iufants, therfore we maſt baptiſe Infants.</hi>

               <p>I Anſwer, I thinke indeed it would take with no ſober Chriſtian thus to argue: The Jewes had it, therefore wee muſt have it. But Sir, to argue thus, God gave ſuch a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to the whole Church of the Jews, that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ſhould be reputed to belong to his Church, and have the initiall ſeale: Therefore if hee have not granted to Chriſtians, that their Infants ſhall alſo bee reputed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to his Church, and partake of the initiall ſeale; then his grace to beleevers under the New Teſtament is ſtraitned as to their poſterity. This Argument appeares ſo cleare to mee, that I muſt confeſſe my ſelfe one of thoſe Dull ones, who know not how to deny the conſequence. In the meane time I obſerve, that though you would make your Reader believe, that theſe perſonall priviledges of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeham,</hi> to have Chriſt born of his fleſh; the Virgin Mary to be the mother of Chriſt, &amp;c. <hi>doe preſſe my Concluſion;</hi> yet you ſpake not one word to vindicate them from my anſwer: And therefore I collect that by this time you ſee, that now under this adminiſtration, ſome perſonal priviledges which a few of the Jews had over and above what belonged to the reſt, may be denyed us, and yet they make nothing againſt this Argument; That if the common priviledges which every one of them had were denyed us, our priviledges were <note place="margin">Diſtinction of Proſelyres of the Gate, and of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, helps not Mr. <hi>Tombes.</hi>
                  </note> ſtraitned. Your other exception which you make concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Melchiſedeck, Lot,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> have been often anſwered before. That which you adde <hi>concerning one kinde of Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes among the Iews, who were called Proſelytes of the gate, who
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:113537:101"/>
though they were not circumciſed, were yet reckoned among the Worſhippers of God, (ſuch at were</hi> Cornelius <hi>and others) and were alſo within the Covenant of grace.</hi> I know not what you intend to gather from it; unleſſe you would intimate, that they were Church-members among the Jewes, although they were not circumciſed; but had you ſaid ſo, that the priviledges and Church-memberſhip of theſe Proſelytes of the Gate, were as honourable as thoſe of the Proſelytes of the Covenant, your learned Readers would have ſmiled at you; ſure there would have been no need for God to have inſtructed <hi>Peter</hi> by a Viſion from heaven, that he ſhould not call them (to whom he was to be ſent) uncleane; nor had <hi>Peter</hi> been ever put to have made his apologie for going in to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company, if theſe uncircumciſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes of the Gate had been reputed Church-members a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews. Next you grant, <hi>The Iews indeed had that priviledge to have their children reckoned in the outward admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, as branches of the O live by their birth, which the Gentiles have not.</hi> But if we Gentiles have it not, then are not wee I pray you, ſtraitned in that particular? And I demand fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when we are graffed in, and ſo naturalized with them, doe we not partake of all the fatneſſe or priviledges of the Olive with them? what Scripture ever denyed it? I demand yet further, did the many ten thouſands of Jews who were baptized in the Apoſtles dayes, by their comming under this beſt adminiſtration of the Covenant, and thereby kept their former growing in the Olive with advantage; did they thereby deprive their Children of that which you ſay was their naturall priviledge? if you thinke ſo, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your evidence to prove it; if they were not, then it ſeemes the Jewes who beleeved in Chriſt, and kept their ſtation, had a greater priviledge for their children, then the Gentiles who grow together with them, have for their children.</p>
               <p>I added, <hi>Let any man ſhew out of the Scripture, where our priviledges under the Goſpel are cut ſhort in any of theſe things, and in particular for the caſe in hand, concerning our Infants right to the Covenant and ſeale of it; once we are ſure the Infant-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

               <p>Laſtly, I added, <hi>who ever will goe about to deprive them of it, to cut off ſuch a great part of the comfort of beleeving Parents, muſt produce clear teſtimonies before they can perſwade beleevers to part with either of them, either right to the Covenant, or to the ſeale of the Covenant; becauſe next to the glory of God, and the ſalvation of their owne ſoules; their Infants intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is one of the greateſt benefits beleevers have from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>

I only ſpoken words without weight, you could and would have diſcovered their emptineſs, and ſcoffed at them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; you make ſeverall ſmall exceptions which I ſhal brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch: as, Firſt, <hi>That I touch ſomething too neare upon the Popiſh Opinion; as if I might be gueſs'd to ſymbolize with that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Papiſts, who judge all unbaptized infants to periſh;</hi> which is not worth the anſwering. Then you demand <hi>What comfort doe wee give Parents, which the Antipaedobaptiſts doe not give them as well as we; or what diſcomforts in truth doe they give them, which we doe not?</hi> I anſwer, the difference is very great, you leave them in the ſtate of Infidells, we in the condition the Jews children were in while they were the people of God; wee account them actually belonging to the viſible kingdom of Chriſt, you actually to belong to the viſible kingdom of the Devill; wee leave them under the benefit of that promiſe, <hi>I will be the God of thee and of thy feed,</hi> you acknowledge no more promiſe for them, then for the children of Turks: it may be theſe things are of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to you, but I doubt not but they will bee with your unprejudiced Reader.</p>

I have already ſhewed the falſeneſſe of it, in the point of the Chriſtians Sabbath; for though the Ceremoniall Worſhip, which was a type of Chriſt, be wholly aboliſhed, yet not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing which concerns all Worſhip which muſt have an inſtitution, is aboliſhed. And for the plea which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and others may pretend from the analogy of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law; when you ſhew how they will raiſe their Arguments (which poſſibly you have more skill and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to doe then I have) as plainly as I doe for Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, you may poſſibly prevaile with the Reader in their behalf.

Secondly, I never numbred the Sabbath amongſt Sacraments, but becauſe the Sabbath belongs to the inſtituted Worſhip of God, as well as the Sacrament, and requires its inſtitution to bee at leaſt as cleare as this about Infant-Baptiſme, which touches but a circumſtance of age, this Argument from the one to the

               <p>Next follows, <hi>the blow which will tumble downe all,</hi> if your ſelfe may be believed: Mark Reader how heavie a one it is. <q>I ſaid when God made the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and promiſed for his part to be the God of him and his ſeed, what God promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> we claime our part in it, as the children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and what God required on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part for the ſubſtance of obedience wee ſtand charged with as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> to beleeve, to love the Lord with all our heart, to walke before God in uprightneſſe, to inſtruct and bring up our Children for God, not for our ſelves, nor for the Devill; to teach them to worſhip God according to his revealed will, to traine them up under Ordinances and Inſtitutions of Gods owne appointment. All theſe things God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abraham,</hi> and wee by vertue of that Covenant (being Covenanters with <hi>Abraham)</hi> ſtand bound to all theſe duties, though there were no expreſſe reviving theſe Commandements in any part of the New Teſtament: and therefore conſequently that command of God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> which bound his ſeed of the Jews to traine up their children in that manner of Worſhip which was then in force, binds beleevers now to traine up their children in conformity to ſuch Ordinances as are now in force.</q>

Secondly, wee have the perſons to whom they were to doe this, all Nations; whereas before the Church was tyed to one Nation, one Nation onely were diſciples; now their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was extended to make all Nations Diſciples, every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſhould receive the faith, ſhould be to him now, as the peculiar Nation of the Iews had been in times paſt; now we know when that one Nation of the Iews were made Diſciples, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, their Children were made Diſciples (made to belong to Gods ſchool) and circumciſed with them, &amp;c.</hi> To this you anſwer, Firſt, <hi>that promiſe, I will be the God of thee and thy ſeed, that it ſhould be thus interpreted, the ſeed of beleevers are taken into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with their Parents, is a new Goſpel, no older then Zwingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> But I have ſufficiently proved that this was good Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the Apoſtles dayes, and in the times of the Fathers of the Primitive Church.

I added, <hi>in every nation the children make a great part of that nation, and are alwayes included under every adminiſtration to the nation, whether promiſes or threatnings, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges or burthens, mercies or judgements, unleſſe they bee excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> whereof I gave divers inſtances in my Sermon; you anſwer, <hi>the Lord hath plainely given a caution in Scripture for the leaving out Infants in this adminiſtration, according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rule, in that hee directs them to baptize Diſciples upon preaching, hee excludes Infants, &amp;c. and when Chriſt and John baptized onely ſuch,</hi> this practiſe excludes others. I anſwer, by what rule then durſt you baptize an Infant knowne to you to bee regenerate, ſince they cannot bee Diſciples upon preaching, if you ſay you cannot doe it by ordinary rule, ſhew us (I pray) your extraordinary; if you anſwer they
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:113537:112"/>
are Diſciples, therefore they may bee baptized; I anſwer, the Infants of beleevers are viſible Diſciples, they viſibly belong to the kingdome, family, ſchoole of Chriſt, as I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved already; any manifeſtation of Gods that perſons belong to his Covenant is to your ſelfe a ſufficient ground of accounting them ſuch, either a promiſe, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt, (though they are no infallible ſignes of inward ſanctification) or confeſſion of faith or of repentance, are warrant ſufficient for us to baptize them, now the promiſe of God to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving parents to bee the God of them and of their ſeed, and his owning them as perſons belonging to his Church, is as reall a manifeſtation of it as the other ſignes of receiving extraordinary gifts, externall profeſſion, &amp;c. either are or can be. And whereas you adde <hi>that Chriſts and Johns Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ſuch,</hi> and no other as <hi>made a viſible profeſſion, is excluſive to all others.</hi> I anſwer, firſt, it is no where ſaid they baptized no others; ſecondly, I deny that conſequence, this is not an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive rule, the practiſe and example of Chriſt, and <hi>John</hi> is ſufficient to make an affirmative or poſitive rule, <hi>they baptized ſuch, therefore wee may baptize ſuch,</hi> but it's not excluſive, that therefore wee may baptize no other, and the reaſon is plaine, they poſſibly might not meet with all perſons and occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo their practiſe is a good rule, not a full rule; I ſhall give one inſtance, wee read not before the tenth of the <hi>Acts</hi> that either Chriſts Apoſtles or <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized any proſelytes of the gate, or that they baptized any (as you ſay) untill they made actuall confeſſion of their faith and repentance, or that there was any rule given, that the receiving the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt ſhould without any other confeſſion bee a ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to Baptize any, yet <hi>Peter</hi> upon the very powring out of thoſe gifts, without requiring any further confeſſion either of faith or repentance, baptized <hi>Cornelius</hi> and all his company: in one word, any word or act of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that ſuch and ſuch belong to his viſible Church, is a ſufficient warrant without any danger of wil-worſhip, and this wee have abundantly for the Infants of beleeving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,

are all wrongly baptized who have not inward grace; and ſo (according to your owne expreſſion) baptiſme to ſuch is as a ſeal ſet to a blank; yet you know, even the Apoſtles themſelves baptized many who were in no better condition: and your ſelfe afterward grant, <hi>That a Miniſter may</hi> defide <hi>adminiſter this Sacrament to ſuch as make a viſible profeſſion, though he be not aſſured of any inward grace.</hi> I have often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that a right to bee reckoned to belong to the viſible Church, is a ſufficient warrant to adminiſter the ſeal of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.

               <p>The firſt Objection I undertooke to anſwer, was to this purpoſe, <hi>Though Infants are capable of theſe things, and that</hi>

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:113537:117"/>
altered by ſubtraction or addition, and that it was pleaded by the Non-conformiſts, that it is Will-worſhip to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by addition of any thing to them, but circumſtances which are alike requiſite to civill actions; now the perſons to be baptized cannot be conceived a meere circumſtance, but belongs neceſſarily to the adminiſtration of worſhip, as well as the perſon baptizing, or the perſons receiving the Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, I intend not needleſly to multiply words, and therefore doe grant that to apply Sacraments to perſons to whom they belong not by the Lords appointment is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of them. Now that it is ſo in this caſe, you goe about to prove out of this 28. <hi>Mat. Becauſe the inſtitution appoints onely diſciples of all Nations to be baptized, and Infants are not ſuch. This you have made good</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. <hi>Part</hi> 3. <hi>You adde, Christs order thus appoints it, which must be kept in this point, as well as in examination before the Lords Supper,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 28. <hi>&amp;c. and that by the inſtitution they are to bee baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, that is, with invocation of the name of the Lord, which Infants cannot doe; with devoting themſelves to the ſervice and adverence of God, which Infants cannot doe; that preſently after baptiſme, the baptized are to be taught to obſerve whatſoever Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

You reply, <hi>If it be not the firſt inſtitution of Baptiſm, yet it is an inſtitution of Baptiſme to us Gentiles; and therefore the rule by which Miniſters are to baptize, or if not, wee muſt ſhew another inſtitution, elſe we cannot acquit it from Will-worſhip.</hi> I anſwer, all this is abundantly anſwered before, <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. <hi>Part</hi> 3. And I add this inlargement of their Commiſſion is very unfitly called by you <hi>an inſtitution of baptiſm unto us;</hi> their Commiſſion at the ſame time was inlarged to preach to

But your third reaſon is a ſtrange one, <hi>They must bee bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, that is,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>with invocation of the Name of the Lord:</hi> then it ſeems if the party baptized call upon the name of the Lord by prayer, that's all that is intended b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As for your fourth, were not the Infants of the Jews devoted to God by Circumciſion, though they could not actually devote themſelves? To your fifth, <hi>That they were to teach them as ſoon as they bad baptized them;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none wete to be baptized, unleſſe they were fit preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after their Baptiſme, to learne the reſt of their duty. I anſwer, this alſo is ſufficiently anſwered in <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. <hi>Part</hi> 3. and I further adde, that baptized perſons ought indeed to be taught all that Chriſt commands them, and ſo likewiſe were circumciſed perſons, but not preſently, onely as they were capable of it, and able to receive it. And as <hi>for the perſons baptized by John, and Chriſts diſciples;</hi> I have before
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:113537:118"/>
anſwered that it cannot appeare that they baptized no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other but ſuch as made profeſſion of faith and repentance; and if it were granted, it follows not, that therefore no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be baptized, their practice is a good rule, though not a full rule, as I ſhewed, <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. <hi>Part</hi> 3. And whereas you ſay, <hi>Iohn baptized none but upon profeſſion of repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> you would have a hard task to prove it, if any man ſhould put you to it; to prove (I ſay) that <hi>Iohn</hi> did impoſe or require confeſſion of ſin before baptiſme, it is ſaid hee baptized them <gap reason="foreign">

Sure I am, I meet with very learned Men who judge thus, <q>That their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſinnes was not becauſe confeſſion was a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>medium</hi> to all who ſhould receive Baptiſme, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe heretofore Baptiſme had initiated into Judaiſme, and ſo to Legall performances; and the men who came to be baptized of <hi>John,</hi> were ſuch who had been educated in an opinion of Juſtification by works of the Law: and therefore <hi>John</hi> in calling for repentance, did but clear his Baptiſme from miſconſtruction, leſt they ſhould think it to be a Baptiſme obliging to legall performances, as that was of old, he would teach them that his Baptiſm was a Baptiſme of repentance and faith in Chriſt, and ſo doth but rectifie thoſe relyers upon their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, in the right doctrine of Juſtification, which the Goſpel now began to teach, contrary to their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall conceited righteouſneſſe; and that therefore his calling for repentance and beliefe in him that ſhould come after, did more ſhew the nature of the Goſpel, to which his Baptiſme was the introduction, then the nature of the Sacrament of Baptiſme it ſelfe, or the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in which it was to be adminiſtred; and with theſe accords the interpretation <hi>Paul</hi> made of <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme,

But ſay you, <hi>This grant that the Iewes who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready were in Covenant, were to make confeſſion before they were baptized, is a ſufficient proofe that the adminiſtration of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, is not the adminiſtration under which we now are:</hi> and that overthrows all virtuall conſequences from Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Baptiſme. I reply, who ever ſaid that this admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is the ſame with theirs? it is the ſame Covenant, but a new adminiſtration. And as to that you ſay, <hi>This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows all virtuall conſequences from Circumciſion to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme;</hi> I have ſo abundantly juſtified this before, that I ſhall not trouble the Reader with it againe, though you repeate this ſo often, that I am ready to thinke you hope your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will beleeve you in one place, if he doe not in the other. You adde my ſaying, <hi>That their Infants were to come in onely in their parents right, doth overthrow my ſecond Argument, becauſe that is grounded upon a right which Infants had of their own,</hi> viz. <hi>participation of the grace of the Sacrament.</hi> I anſwer, belike then if any had pleaded thus for the Jewes Infants, That <hi>to Infants, as well as growne men, God communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſpirituall part of Circumciſion, therefore they might bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed;</hi> you would anſwer, that that Argument would overthrow their right from their birth-priviledge.

of their right to the Sacrament, God not onely giving them a viſible ſtanding in his Church, becauſe they are the ſeed of the faithfull, but among them, who are Infants as well as among growne men doth worke inward grace by his holy Spirit according to his good pleaſure. Whereas you adde, <hi>that you cannot yet diſcerne but that our grounds for Paed baptiſme are worſe then the Papiſts and ancients, who build it upon the neceſſitie of baptiſme to ſalvation;</hi> I muſt needs tell you, your reſpect to the reformed Churches in this is very ſmall, whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But you glory much in the advantage you thinke you have got, from that which followes in my Sermon, <hi>the Heathen nations who were to bee converted to Chriſt were yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Covenant of grace, and their children could have no right untill themſelves were brought in, and therefore no marvaile though both Iohn and Chriſts Diſciples and Apoſtles did teach before they baptized, becauſe then no other were capable of baptiſme, in this</hi> (ſay you) <hi>I grant many things which doe yeeld the cauſe:</hi> Sir, I ſhall not recall any one of them, make your beſt of your advantage. 1.

               </p>
               <p>But I reply, though you dare not: owne this Argument, yet it ſtands upon the ſame ground that the reſt of your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments doe, and upon the ſame grounds that many of your expreſſions doe, ſuch as this, <hi>That men are not to bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, becauſe they may have grace, but becauſe they have it.</hi> But now you will not ſtick to this, That to have true faith, is a pre-requiſite to Baptiſm; you are contented with an outward confeſſion of it onely, and that a viſible profeſſion gives right to a viſible memberſhip, and conſequently that a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble memberſhip gives a right to Baptiſme, which is the thing I have been contending for all this while. As for what you adde, That in the dayes of <hi>Iuſtin Martyr, Tertullian, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> and ſo forward, this confeſſion before baptiſme was continued: it is true, it was continued for thoſe that had been Pagans and Infidels, that they ſhould make ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion before Baptiſme; and it is as true, that in their days Infants of Chriſtians were baptized.</p>

               <p>Whereas I added, That <hi>I doubted whether in caſe</hi> Peter, <hi>or</hi> Paul <hi>could by the Spirit of revelation have known that</hi> Ananias, <hi>or</hi> Alexander, <hi>would have proved no better then hypocrites, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I anſwer, the cauſe depends not upon it, whether your conjecture or mine be righteſt in this particular; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, ſhould ſuch an extraordinary revelation be made pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to warne them not to admit ſuch perſons, that would be equivalent to a prohibition; but might not ſuch a thing be revealed for other ends?

               <p>You adde <hi>that you doe not well underſtand that God required of the Jewes Infants to ſeale in their Infancy;</hi> I reply, but I hope you underſtand, that the <hi>Jewes Infants were ſealed in their Infancy,</hi> and by this they received not onely a priviledge to bee accounted as belonging to Gods family, but it alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to the ſeverall duties of the Covenant, as they grew up to bee capable of performing them. I added, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>God hath other ends and uſes of applying the Seale of the Covenant to them who are in Covenant with him, then their preſent gaine, it is an homage, worſhip, and honour to himſelfe, and it behooves us in that reſpect to fulfill all righteouſneſſe; when Chriſt was baptized and circumciſed hee was as unfit for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance through his perfection, as children through their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, being as much above them as Children are below them:</hi> your anſwer is, <hi>Baptiſme is Gods worſhip, Paedobaptiſme a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip; Chriſts Baptiſme was of a tranſcondens nature, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are unfit for this ordinance, not becauſe of their imperfection, but through defect of Gods appointment; had God appointed it, there were no doubt to bee made of their fitneſſe;</hi> all this hath been conſidered and weighed againe and againe, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to burden the Reader needleſly.

doe belong to the kingdome of the devill, it is a harſh and uncharitable ſpeech.</hi> Sir, I am glad to heare you give that cenſure upon your owne judgement, it is your judgement that all Infants even of Beleevers as well as Pagans though they may potentially belong to the kingdome of Chriſt, yet actually they belong to the Kingdome of the devill; but for my ſelfe, I meant onely the children of Infidells, I doe not thinke that beleeving Anabaptiſts doe through their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or errour put their children out of this priviledge. You demand further, <hi>What comfort doe I give more to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving parents that have their children baptized, then belongs to them, though their children were not baptized.</hi> I anſwer, if it bee not through the parents fault that their children be unbaptized, but onely by the providence of God, they may have the ſame comfort, yet I conceive it a greater inlargement of comfort to enjoy the viſible Seale, an ordinance which they are capable of, and which God uſes to bleſſe according to his good pleaſure; but I ſay when parents doe therefore not baptize upon this principle, that their children doe not belong to the Church of Chriſt, no more then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Turkes and Pagans, and conſequently are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that pale, where ordinarily ſalvation is onely to bee had, it is eaſie to ſay that their comfort cannot bee ſo much as others: your ſelfe doe grant <hi>that this which I plead for is a comfortable condition if it could be made out,</hi> page 82. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I added <hi>they need not make any doubt of their childrens welfare, if they die in their Infancy, &amp;c.</hi> You anſwer, <hi>I ſpeake like one who holds that Baptiſme doth conferre grace ex opere operato:</hi> But why ſo? when I ground it upon the <hi>Covenant,</hi> upon their <hi>capacitie</hi> both of the <hi>Seale</hi> and the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace,</hi> and yet leave all to bee done by God, who hath mercy upon whom hee will have mercy; I ſaid not that they may <hi>de fide</hi> bee aſſured of their ſalvation, but that they need not have any doubt, the ſame which may bee ſaid of growne viſible profeſſors. I added, <hi>here is alſo much priviledge and benefit to children when as (beſide what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſecres worke God is pleaſed to worke in them) they being members of the Church of Chriſt have their ſhare in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

I anſwer, as it is a plea for viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors all their dayes, ſo it is a plea for Infants, when they grow up upon the ſame condition, and though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and faith in Chriſt bee our beſt plea, yet Baptiſme the Seale is no meane one, and you who ſay, <hi>that of old the influence of comfort from baptiſme was very great, I hope did not intend to limit it to the preſent time of its receiving,</hi> but extended it to all caſes, which may fall within the compaſſe of thoſe things for which Baptiſme was appointed to bee a Seale, and as long as it remaines a Seale, and why you ſhould ſpeake againſt the pleading of Infant Baptiſme, when they come to fulfill the condition and to have the anſwer of a good conſcience toward God, (in which caſe the Apoſtle ſaid Baptiſme ſaves us) I cannot tell, unleſſe you think with the Anabaptiſts that Infant Baptiſme is a nullitie, which if you doe, I pray you let us know it in your next.</p>

To this you anſwer, <hi>This Argument is good</hi> ad homines <hi>againſt them who argue that to whom the Covenant belongs, to them the Seale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs,</hi> and you ſay, <hi>this argument is confirmed by the practiſe and opinion of the ancients, who gave the Lords Supper to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants for</hi> 600. <hi>yeers as well as baptiſme.</hi> I reply, my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment runs thus; <hi>To whom belongs the Covenant, to them belongs the initiall Seale of the Covenant,</hi> not <hi>every</hi> Seale of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and though the Lords ſupper bee a Seale of the Covenant, and ſucceed the Paſſeover as a Seale of that Covenant, yet neither the Paſſeover, nor the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per were appointed to bee initiall Seales; and though Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which is the initiall Seale, ſerves to confirme the reſt of the benefits of the Covenant, as the baptized grow ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of them, or are made partakers of them, yet the prime and maine uſe of it is to bee a Seale of initiation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception into Covenant. As for what you adde of <hi>the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents giving the Lords Supper to Infants for</hi> 600. <hi>yeeres,</hi> I have before anſwered to it, that it cannot bee proved to bee ſo generall a practiſe as the baptizing of Infants was among them, nor was it pleaded by any ſuch Arguments, as they pleaded for Infant Baptiſme; Indeed in the African Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches about <hi>Cyprians</hi> and <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was given to Infants, but I can finde no ſuch generall practiſe of it as you would inſinuate. Howbeit, I am glad that upon this occaſion you acknowledge, that <hi>for the firſt</hi> 600. <hi>yeers Infants were baptized among the ancients,</hi> though I know not how this will agree with that which you have ſo
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:113537:125"/>
fidently aſſerted before, that it was hardly knowne in the Church for the firſt 300. yeers. Whereas I added, <hi>that though baptiſme and the Lords Supper are both of them Seales of the new Covenant, yet it is with ſome difference; the firſt is for birth and entrance, the other is for food and growth;</hi> you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>this is a paradox to you, becauſe if</hi> I <hi>make the entrance at the remiſſion of ſinnes, juſtification, &amp;c. the Lords Supper which ſeales Chriſts death, ſeales the entrance into the Covenant, and Baptiſme ſeales as well the pardon of other ſinnes as of originall ſinne; and therefore this difference which</hi> I <hi>put of the one being a Seale for entrance, the other for growth, is a difference which the Scripture makes not.</hi> I reply, if this bee a paradox, your ſelfe have very often owned this paradox, in calling both Circumciſion and Baptiſme the Seales of our admiſſion, and that by Baptiſme <hi>wee are exhibited to bee members of Chriſt and his Church:</hi> which you yet never ſaid the Sacrament of the Lords Supper was appointed to bee. And as for what you now adde <hi>that the Lords Supper ſealing the death of Chriſt doth therefore ſeale our entrance;</hi> I anſwer, it followes not, it ſeales indeed the whole Covenant in its due place and order, as our food is a witneſſe that wee are alive, and is a meanes to preſerve our life, but yet it muſt bee ſuppoſed that wee are firſt made alive before wee are capable of the benefit of our food. And whereas you jerke at that phraſe of the Lords Supper ſealing the <hi>growth and augmentation of the Covenant,</hi> as an unfit expreſſion; truely, I thought every child would have underſtood, that by nouriſhment and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation I meant nothing but the nouriſhment and growth of thoſe graces of the Covenant, which the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant promiſeth, and all are tied to ſeek after. As to that of <hi>the Jewes Infants eating the Paſſeover,</hi> I anſwered, <hi>there is no ſuch thing mentioned in the books of God: It is ſaid indeed that the ſeverall families were to eate the Lambe, and if the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were too little to eate a Lambe, ſeverall families were to joyne together, and that when their children ſhould aske them the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, they were to inſtruct them about it, but not a word of inſtitution appointing them to eate it, nor any example witneſſing that they did eate it:</hi> You anſwer, <hi>All the males were appointed
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:113537:126"/>
three times a yeere to appeare before the Lord, one of which was the Paſſeover, and at that time there was no other food to bee eaten, but unleavened bread and the Paſcall Supper; and you obſerve out of</hi> Ainſworth <hi>that every child that could hold his father by the hand, and could goe up from Jeruſalem gates to the mountaine of the Temple, his father was bound to carry him up, to the end hee might catechiſe him in the Commandements, and they who went up were bound to keepe the feaſt.</hi> I anſwer, were the Jewes bound to carry all their Babes up with them to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or any of them, before they had underſtanding in thoſe rites and myſteries? and was there no food among them all that time, but the Sacramentall food? were the uncleane and uncircumciſed in their families to faſt all that time? produce any Scripture that witneſſeth theſe; you indeed quote two or three broken teſtimonies out of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> who lived ſome hundred yeers after Chriſt, but not one text of Scripture, and yet even your <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſay no more then I am willing to grant, that when they could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſervice, they might partake of it; nor doth the Goſpell prohibite ſuch young ones to partake of the Lords Supper, who are able to diſcerne the Lords body. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve alſo that when a teſtimony out of a Jewiſh Rabbi ſeemes to make any thing on your ſide, you draw more confident concluſions from it, and fetch conſequences fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then you will allow mee to doe out of the holy Scriptures.</p>

Of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between <hi>Hazaels</hi> cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to Infants and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts.</note> not being argumentative; onely in the firſt uſe you againe fall upon the compariſon <hi>which I made betwixt Hazaels ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Infants of Iſrael, and the principles of the Anabaptiſts, in putting the children of beleevers out of the Covenant of grace,</hi> and this you aggravate to the utmoſt, calling it a <hi>falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, a fruit of paſſion, not of holy zeale:</hi> this alſo you fell upon in the very beginning of your treatiſe, where I anſwered, <hi>I compared not their intentions with his, but the fruit of their principles, caſting all beleevers children, as much out of the Covenant of grace as they doe the children of Turkes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans;</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:113537:126"/>
and this I am ſure they doe, and your ſelfe joyne with them, who acknowledge no more promiſe for the children of beleevers, then for the children of Turkes, and leave them to have their actuall ſtanding in the viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Devill. This I ſaid in a ſpirituall ſenſe was more heavy to the bowells of Chriſtian parents, then to ſee their Infants ſlaine before their face, while in the meane time they might looke upon their Infants ſo dying, to bee within the pale of the Church, where ſalvation is ordinarily to bee found; this I leave the Reader to judge of. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you adde that <hi>this followes not upon the doctrine of Antipae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſme that Infants are thus excluded, and that if to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Covenant of grace, bee rightly expounded, you exclude them from the Covenant of grace no more then I doe;</hi> of the truth of this, without any needleſſe repetition, I leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge by what hath been diſputed betwixt you and mee; if they find this aſſertion of yours to bee true, I give them leave to charge mee with the ſame <hi>raſhneſſe, falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,</hi> and <hi>paſſions,</hi> which here you powre upon mee; if not, I am ſure they will lay it all at your dore.</p>

                  <hi>that you hope I ſee cauſe to conſider more exactly of this buſineſſe then I had done before, that I am not now ſo confident as I was, that this is Gods truth:</hi> I anſwer, as in the preſence of the ſame great God to whom you and I both muſt give an account, I have ſeriouſly weighed what you have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or any other who have come to my hands, with a full reſolution not to ſhut my eyes againſt what light hee would cauſe to ſhine upon mee, and upon my moſt diligent ſtudy, accompanied with my weake, yet ſincere and earneſt prayers, I am more confirmed in it, and the more I have ſtudied, the clearer it appeares unto mee. Secondly, you ſay you have endeavored to examine <hi>every thing of weight delivered in my Sermon, and what you could remember of</hi> Mr. Thomas Goodwins, <hi>and what</hi> Mr. Blake, <hi>or any other have written about this thing;</hi> and I likewiſe have ſeriouſly

weighed and not paſt over any thing of weight in this your Examen. Thirdly, you ſay <hi>you choſe out my Sermon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am in print ſtiled the Antefignanus, the Enſigne-bearer;</hi> a title which I neither deſerve nor deſire. Fourthly, you motion <hi>that all wee who have appeared in publique in this cauſe would joyne our ſtrength together in a reply to this your Examen, that you might ſee the whole ſtrength imbattel'd, that you might not be put to the reading of every Pamphlet.</hi> Truely Sir, this ſmells a little too rankly, thus confidently to challenge all men, not contented with <hi>Goliah</hi> to ſay, <hi>Give mee a man, that I might fight with him,</hi> but to defie <hi>a whole hoſt,</hi> argues a little too much ſelfe-confidence. But for your ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, here is my booke, you may try your ſtrength againſt it, and though I find my impaired health and multitude of imployments is like to bee an apology for mee, from drawing this ſaw any longer, nor indeed is it needfull, there being no end of writing, all knowing that there is no controverſie of faith, wherein learned and prejudiced men have not been able to write booke after booke againſt the truth, eſpecially when they chooſe ſuch a way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing as you have choſen; However, I feare not but it will indure your uttermoſt oppoſition, and if my booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone bee looked upon, as too poore a buſineſſe, you ſee there are already two or three other bookes extant already, againſt you, and I am informed two peeces at leaſt come out of <hi>New-England</hi> upon the ſame ſubject, your ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein concerned (for even thither have ſome ſent your writings, and ſufficiently in them, ſhewed your ſcorne of Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> and my ſelfe, as our friends doe from thence write unto us) you may take us all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then wee may goe for a pretty Army, and when you have done all you can, I doubt not but ſome will be found who will have leaſure as well as ability to cope with you; I onely deſire you in your next not to goe on in this way of making wrangling exceptions, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſlurre and blind what is written by your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, but by ſolid and cleare arguments, ſee if you can refute that which is aſſerted, and let your Reader alſo
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:113537:127"/>
know as well what you would have, as what you would not have, and open your judgement to the full in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and ſhew whether you take Infant-baptiſm to be <hi>valid,</hi> or a <hi>nullity,</hi> and if you think it not a nullity, ſhew your grounds for it, why all this ſhould be true, which you have thus far contended for, That <hi>Infants are no more to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted belonging to the Church of Chriſt then Pagans,</hi> and yet their baptiſme ſhould be valid, whether if any man ſhould bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize a Turk or a Iew when he ſhould be aſleep, or by violence or any wayes againſt his own conſent, this baptiſme were not a nullity, and I know not what difference you make between the one and the other.</p>
               <p>If on the other ſide, you doe thinke it a nullity, then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt how any at all can now be baptized, unleſſe you will thinke that they may baptize others who are unbaptized themſelves; for my own part, I ſeriouſly profeſſe, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Infant-baptiſme a nullity, I cannot underſtand how any in the world ſhould this day be lawfully baptized, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it can be made good that a perſon unbaptized himſelfe may be a lawfull Miniſter of baptiſme to others: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly untill the Anabaptiſts aroſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> all the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized world were baptized while they were Infants; and conſequently the firſt Anabaptiſt was baptized by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized perſon, and ſo in concluſion we muſt all turn See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and be content without baptiſme, till Chriſt give ſome extraordinary Commiſſion from Heaven unto ſome men to be Apoſtles in this buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, you expreſſe <hi>the ſtraights you are like to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the loſſe of your ſmall ſtipend,</hi> as a conſequent of this your Opinion. Sir, I am perſwaded this is made up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly in that Honourable Society where now you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe your Miniſtery; and I beſeech the Lord ſo to informe you in his truth in this particular, and to guide your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that you may no longer be a ſtumbling-block to others, nor others prove ſtumbling-blocks to you, that thoſe good parts which God hath beſtowed upon you, may for the time to come be employed in the moſt ſerviceable way, that both your worke and wages may bee with and from the Lord.</p>

Sixthly and laſtly, <hi>you declare your willingneſſe, either to have conference with me, to conſult about a way of a brotherly debating of this point, or to receive other anſwer within the ſpace of a month.</hi> What paſt betwixt your ſelfe and me in Conference, I have given the Reader an account of in the beginning of my Booke; and in truth, I verily thought you would quietly have kept your Opinion as private to your ſelf, which was the true reaſon why I medled with your Book no ſooner; as ſoon as it was publiſhed, I took my ſelf bound in conſcience to take it into Examination, and give this publike account of it; ſince which time God hath been pleaſed to viſit mee with ſickneſſe and infirmity of body, ſo that for a moneth or ſix weeks I could very little attend upon this task, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other employments have compelled me to go through it, <hi>horis ſucceſſivis,</hi> not being able to attend it many whole days without much interruption. Such as it is you now have it with you, and I make bold to ſay again, I am verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it is <hi>Gods</hi> truth which I maintain againſt you, and I fear not my account of this Work in the great day; ſave onely I muſt ever acknowledge and bewaile thoſe frailties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities which cleave to whatever I put my hand unto.</p>

            <head>A Brief EXAMINATION OF Mr. <hi>TOMBES</hi> his Exercitation about INFANT-BAPTISM.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Exercitation might very well have been ſpared in this place, for any great advantage it is like to bring to your cauſe, but I am very glad it is extant, becauſe all Learned men will by it plainly diſcern how mean and poor your Arguments are, when you come poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to aſſert, they will now finde that true which I ſaid in the beginning, that your faculty is farre better in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſlurring, and plundering the Arguments of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, then in making good your owne. You have here impanelled a whole Jury, and would faine perſwade a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of twelve men to ſtand upon record on your ſide, as having found Infant-Baptiſme guilty of the crimes which you have laid to its charge: I ſhall very briefly examine what every one of them have ſaid, and only run them over, partly, becauſe there are lately extant two learned Treatiſes againſt it, written by Doctor <hi>Homes,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Geree,</hi> the firſt of them was publiſhed when my Book was almoſt half Printed, the other ſince; but chiefly becauſe almoſt every ſentence in this your Exercitation which hath any ſtrength is by yourſelfe brought into your other Treatiſe, which
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:113537:129"/>
you call the <hi>Examen</hi> of my Sermon, and there is already fully anſwered.</p>
            <p>Of your twelve Arguments, the firſt is not properly to be called an <hi>Argument againſt</hi> Infant-Baptiſme, but is rather an <hi>anſwer</hi> to ſeverall Arguments pretended to bee brought for Infant-Baptiſme; and upon this you beſtow at leaſt two third parts of your Exercitation, twice as much I nke and Paper upon the foreman of the Jury, as you doe upon the other eleven.</p>
            <p>Vnder the head of this firſt Argument, you have brought in no leſſe then fourteen Arguments (as you call them) for the lawfulneſſe of Infant-Baptiſme, and then you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to anſwer them; your ſelf ſay truly of many of them, <hi>they make a number without ſtrength;</hi> and therefore as you have made a conqueſt of them, doe with your priſoners what you pleaſe, for I count them not worth the redeeming; onely this I ſay, we have ſix or ſeven of your twelve, which I think all the world, and your ſelfe alſo, will grant to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoners by us, if you pleaſe we will exchange them for the other, and then in the exchange we ſhall loſe nothing, being aſſured yours are as weake and ſimple as it is poſſible for thoſe to be which you have taken; and for the reſt of the arguments brought for Paedo-Baptiſme, you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your owne advantage, ſo ſet them downe as to make them beſt capable of the ſpecious anſwers you bring unto them; but I like not that an enemy ſhould have the ordering of the Forces which hee meanes to fight againſt, you muſt give us leave to chooſe our own weapons, and Marſhall our own Forces, and then you may try your skill and valour againſt them. Doctor <hi>Homes</hi> hath made his Annotations upon all the arguments which you have produced according to your owne method Mr. <hi>Geree</hi> hath choſen out onely thoſe arguments which carry moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and not troubled himſelfe to examine every thing; for my part, I humbly conceive that Infant-baptiſme is not to be fetched from any <hi>one</hi> of theſe grounds <hi>ſingly,</hi> but is built upon the <hi>identity of the Covenant, Infants right to the Covenant, and the initiall ſeale;</hi> and conſequently though one Text may
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:113537:129"/>
be a ſufficient <hi>medium</hi> or Argument to prove ſome one or two of them, yet to make the evidence full, theſe ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> muſt not be ſeparated one from another, but neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe muſt be had to them all; and if all your Arguments doe overthrow any one of them, either the Covenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame in ſubſtance, or infants right to the Covenant, or the Lords appointing an initiall ſeale to bee adminiſtred to all who are reputed belonging to the Covenant, I ſhall readily yeeld the cauſe, as I have often told you.

               </note> or rather your anſwer to Arguments, ſhal be to point him to ſuch places in my book, where you have already preſt the ſame things, and I have given an anſwer to them.</p>
            <p>The firſt Argument from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. hath beene examined, Part 3. Sect. 1, 2. and elſwhere.</p>
            <p>The ſecond argument taken from Baptiſm ſucceeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the room of Circumciſion, and <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12, &amp;c. is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Part 3. Sect. 9.</p>
            <p>The third argument from the priviledges of beleevers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament, is examined, Part 3. Sect. 11. 7.</p>
            <p>The fourth argument from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>8. is fully examined, Part 3. Sect. 6.</p>
            <p>The fifth argument from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. is examined, Part 3. Sect. 8.</p>
            <p>The ſixth argument from <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. &amp;c. which alſo you put into ſeverall ſhapes, is examined, Part 3. Sect. 15.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh argument from <hi>Acts</hi> 16. and ſeverall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places which ſpeake of baptizing of houſholds, is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Part 3. Sect 14. And in theſe ſeverall places you have preſſed whatever is of any ſeeming weight in this your Exercitation, and added many other things which the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall finde to bee examined in the places which I have pointed to, beſides in ſeverall other places of my Booke, where you have again and again repeated many of the ſame things.</p>
            <p>The other ſeven arguments (as you call them) I looke not upon as arguments, and therefore will not meddle with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome of the Scriptures mentioned in them, as,

               <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo farre as they have any uſe in this controverſie, are alſo conſidered of here, and there in my Book, as the Reader may obſerve.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond Argument againſt Infant Baptiſme is fetcht from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>That which agrees not with the Lords inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>of Baptiſme, that is deſervedly doubtfull; But the rite of Infant-baptiſme agrees not with the Lords inſtitution of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, Ergo.</hi> This argument hath received its full examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Part 3. Sect. 13. and Part 4. Sect. 1. whither I refer the <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Reader, as not willing to trouble him with needleſſe repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the ſame things.</p>
            <p>Your third Argument is taken from the practice of the Apoſtles, and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and runs thus, <hi>That tenet and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>practice which being put, Baptiſm cannot be adminiſtred as John Baptist and the Apoſtles did adminiſter it, agrees not with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of John Baptiſt and the Apoſtles; But the tenet and practice of Infant-Baptiſme being put, Baptiſme cannot bee administred as Jo.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; Ergo &amp;c.</hi> This you goe about to prove, becauſe <hi>John and the Apoſtles bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed none but ſuch as confeſſed ſinnes, they required ſhewes of faith and repentance in all whom they baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Argument relates wholly to matter of fact, wherein you put your ſelfe to prove a negative; and therefore the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> can prove nothing, unleſſe you can produce ſome one place at leaſt out of the Scripture wherein it is ſaid no Infant was baptized by them, or no other then ſuch as you have mentioned; but what you have here ſaid about it is fully conſidered, Part. 3. Sect. 13. eſpecially Part 4. Sect. 1.</p>
            <p>Theſe three Arguments, which alone deſerve to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (if yet the firſt may be ſo called) are fully examined in the places above-mentioned; the reſt of your arguments are ſo wholly inconſequent, that I wonder you ſhould think them worthy or fit to face an Aſſembly of Divines, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that they ſhould joyne their ſtrength together to frame an anſwer to them; when as I verily thinke they may all bee routed by the running pen of an ordinary Clerke in a few houres.</p>
            <p>Your fourth is taken from the next age after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſtands thus in your book, <hi>Becauſe Infant-baptiſme <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4.</note>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:113537:130"/>
cannot be proved that it was inforce or uſe in the next age after the Apostles;</hi> Ergo, <hi>the tenet and practice of it is doubtfull. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> (you ſay) <hi>is manifest of it ſelfe; for the minor you alledge</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, <hi>and</hi> Strabo; <hi>and</hi> (ſay you, <hi>it is confirmed by examining of places brought to that purpoſe, &amp; by continuing queſtions to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties baptized in ages following, and other tokens from Councells, and Eccleſiaſticall writers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, to your Major, which you ſay is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of its ſelfe, I judge to bee moſt falſe, and a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> poſition: is every tenet and practice doubtfull, which cannot be proved by hiſtoricall evidence to have been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and practiced in that age, whereof we have ſo few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords? the proceſſion of the holy Ghoſt, the propagation of originall ſinne, and many other Tenets, I beleeve you will neither find mentioned in that age nor the next; How would you have laughed at ſuch a concluſion ſet downe by another? And ſecondly, for your Minor, I anſwer 1. There were no Councells at all aſſembled in that age next to the Apoſtles. And 2. as for Eccleſiaſticall Writers, I wiſh you would name them; I beleeve you will find very few Writers of credit in that age, whoſe legitimate workes are tranſmitted to poſterity. Thirdly, how do <hi>Vives</hi> and <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> know what was done in the ages next the Apoſtles, when the eldeſt of them lived almoſt 800 years after that age? the authority and skill of theſe two men hath been ſufficiently ſpoken to, Part 1. Sect. 2. Fourthly, I wonder how the queſtions propounded in ages following to the baptized, doe prove that Infant-Baptiſme was not in uſe in the age next after the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Your fifth argument runs thus, <hi>That which in ſucceeding</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>ages in which it was in uſe, was in force firſt as a Tradition not written. Secondly, out of imitation of Jewiſh circumciſion. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without univerſall practice. Fourthly, together with the error of giving Infants the Lords Supper, and with many other humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions under the name of Apoſtolicall Traditions, that is deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dly doubtfull. But ſuch was Infant-Baptiſme in thoſe ages,</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, &amp;c. I anſwer, firſt, by denying your Major, the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords day hath beene by ſome accounted a Tradition, others have ſaid it is Jewiſh to keep any Sabbath
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:113537:131"/>
at all, becauſe Sabbath dayes were a ſhadow of things to come, but the body is Chriſt, what will you thence conclude againſt our Chriſtian Sabbath? And for what you ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the practice of it that it was not univerſall, I deſire you to remember, that <hi>argumentum ductum a non facto ad non jus eſt abſurdiſſimum;</hi> may wee plead thus, ſuch and ſuch a thing was not generally obſerved, <hi>Ergo</hi> it was not a duty? the boyes in the Schooles would ſtamp and hiſſe at ſuch an inference; from the dayes of <hi>Ioſoua,</hi> to the dayes of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miab,</hi> the children of Iſrael had not kept the feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles <note place="margin">Nehem. 8. 17.</note> in Booths or Tents, which was about a thouſand yeares; was it therefore not their duty to have done it? Dr. <hi>Hoylin</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Sabbath, urgeth this very argument againſt the Lords day, <hi>in ſuch and ſuch Fathers days many did not obſerve the Lords day, many did tipple and dance upon the Lords day;</hi> ergo <hi>the Lords day was not generally obſerved, and if it were not generally obſerved in thoſe days,</hi> Ergo <hi>we are not bound to obſerve it.</hi> This kind of arguing is almoſt as wilde as that which the Schools call, <hi>a baculo ad angulum,</hi> my ſtaffe ſtands in the corner, <hi>Ergo</hi> it will rain tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>Your laſt Exception under this fourth argument is yet more ſtrange, <hi>There were many other things went under the name of Traditions, which were meer humane inventions,</hi> Ergo <hi>Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm,</hi> which went under the name of a Tradition is alſo a humane invention. Shall I ſhew the naturall face of this argument in a glaſſe; ſuch and ſuch men who went under the name of honeſt men were knaves; <hi>Ergo</hi> all that goe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nder the name of honeſt men are knaves. It is true, many things went in thoſe dayes under the name of Traditions, which were but humane inventions, and it is as true that many points of faith, and other divine inſtitutions went in the ſame ages under the name of Traditions, as I have made apparent, Part 1. Sect. 2. You ſee what a poore argument this would prove although your <hi>minor</hi> were true, though the things were as you ſet them downe; but I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved the contrary: I have ſhewed the Ancients re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it as a <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> and upon <hi>ſuch</hi> arguments as we doe, though ſome of them preſt ſome corrupt grounds which we reject: and as for the univerſality of the practice of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:113537:131"/>
it both in the Greek and Latin Churches I have abundantly cleared it from all Objections you make againſt it: and you out of all your reading have not been able <hi>to produce one of the ancients, who either beld it unlawfull, or denyed that it was in uſe from the Apoſtles dayes.</hi> One or two indeed you bring who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the deferring Infant-Baptiſm, as they did alſo the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of grown men; and ſome examples you produce of the children of Chriſtians not baptized (as you think) in their Infancy; to all which I have ſpoken at large, <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. And as for what you alledge of their giving the Lords Supper unto Infants, I have denyed, and ſhall doe ſtill, till you bring ſome evidence for it, that there was any ſuch uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall practiſe, indeed in the African Churches that errour did obtain in the days of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but I finde no ſuch generall practice of it; however the Argument follows not, That <hi>it was their error to give Infants the Lords Supper;</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go <hi>it was their error to baptize Infants.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Your ſeventh, eighth, and ninth Arguments are but ſo many branches or rather ſo many repetitions of your ſixth <note place="margin">

Secondly, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deny your minor; they who thus oppoſed invocation

Sect. 2. What under the head of this tenth Argument you mention out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> hath beene fully confidered of, Part 1.

            <p>Your eleventh Argument runs thus; <hi>The aſſerters of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 11.</note> 
               <hi>little agree among themſelves upon what foundation to build Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme:</hi> ſome from <hi>univerſalitie of divine grace,</hi> ſome from <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of Baptiſme to ſalvation,</hi> ſome from <hi>the promiſe of the ſureties,</hi> ſome from <hi>the faith of the Infants,</hi> ſome from <hi>the faith of the next parents, Ergo,</hi> What? what concluſion can you make from this: <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> The Antipaedobaptiſts reject the Baptiſme of Infants upon ſeverall grounds: ſome becauſe Infants have no ſinne, ſome becauſe they have no more to doe with the Covenant of grace, then the Infants of Turkes; ſome becauſe Infants are not capable of grace, ſome becauſe they are unbeleevers, ſome becauſe we cannot know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have grace or no, will you therefore ſay Antipaedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is to bee rejected? So for the Lords day, fome pleade it upon one ground, others reject that ground, and plead it upon another, have therefore none of them hit upon a right ground? the like may bee ſaid of many other points both of faith and practiſe in Chriſtianitie; the utmoſt that can bee collected from mens different grounds in pleading for ſuch or ſuch a truth is, that God hath not left that truth ſo cleare as poſſible he hath done others wherein there is a greater conſent: but to collect that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the opinion is to be rejected, is a ſtrange conſequence. I add far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that almoſt all, both ancient and moderne, doe agree in the argument from Circumciſion to Baptiſme, which neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies our Covenant to be the ſame with theirs, our Infants right to be the ſame with theirs, and our Sacrament of Baptiſme to be the ſame with theirs of Circumciſion as to the uſe of an initiall Seale.</p>
            <p>Your twelfth and laſt Argument which brings up your reere, which you call a weighty reaſon, runs thus: <hi>Becauſe Infant-Baptiſme</hi>

               <hi>ſeemes to take away one, perhaps the primary end of Baptiſme, viz. that it ſhould bee a ſigne that the baptized ſhew himſelfe a Diſciple, and confeſſe the faith in which hee hath been inſtructed,</hi> and this you prove from <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt and other paſſages in the New Teſtament, which put
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:113537:133"/>
Baptiſme for Doctrine, from the forme of Chriſts inſtitution, and by the uſe of Baptiſme in the initiating of Proſelytes, and hence you collect that Baptiſme doth not onely confirme a benefit, but ſignifies alſo a profeſſion made.</hi> To which I anſwer: This Argument how weightie ſoever it bee, is but a branch taken from your ſecond argument out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. and from your third argument from the practiſe of <hi>John</hi> and Chriſts Apoſtles, and is but a <hi>Crambe</hi> of what you have often preſt before, and hath received its full anſwer, Part 3. Sect. 13. and Part 4. Sect 1. and I adde further, that even that which your ſelfe here ſets downe, gives a full anſwer to your own Argument, for you ſay that <hi>a Sacrament is not only a viſible ſigne of an inviſible grace, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

And that which you adde of the uſe of Baptiſme in the initiating of Proſelytes into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Judaiſme, is as full to the purpoſe as can bee to prove what I affirme: for wee know from all the Authors who write about it, that Infants as well as growne men were initiated into the profeſſion of Judaiſme by the rite of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place you ſhut up your Exercitation <hi>with a diſcourſe about the Devills indenting with witches to renounce their Baptiſme, as if ſome would thence argue that Infant-Baptiſme is good, becauſe the Devill would have them renounce it:</hi> but <hi>you,</hi> who it ſeemes know the Devills mind in it, <hi>ſay the true reaſon why hee requires witches to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Baptiſme, is not becauſe the Baptiſme is good in reſpect of the adminiſtration of it, but becauſe the faith mentioned in the forme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
