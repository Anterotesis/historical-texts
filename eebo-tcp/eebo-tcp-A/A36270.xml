            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And therefore now, in ſtead of diſputing any longer againſt their Cavils, it will be great Charity, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and make out this Truth for them: And that I will do from the mouth of their Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> who propheſies thus; <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from</hi>

Now we all ſee, that the Scepter is many Ages ſince departed from <hi>Judah;</hi> they have not for almoſt 1600 years been ſo much as a People, but ſcattered, proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Vagabonds, driven like Chaff before the Wind over the face of the Earth. So that if <hi>Shiloh</hi> be not come already, he never can come, the poſitive preciſe limitation of his time being evidently paſt at the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh State.</hi> But then, if you recollect when that diſſolution happened, that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> deſtroyed their <hi>Temple-ſervice</hi> and Common-wealth, juſt when the Nations were gathered to the obedience of Chriſt, when the <hi>Gentiles</hi> began

to receive the Goſpel at the preaching of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; You will believe that old <hi>Jacob</hi> was vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed on his Death-bed a ſight and revelation of Chriſts Spiritual Dominion, and dyed in that hope; Promiſing to <hi>Judah,</hi> (now the head of his Family) That ſome face of Government ſhould always be preſerved among the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (as there was in their greateſt diſtreſſes) untill <hi>Shilo, Judah's</hi> ſon after the fleſh, ſhould begin to reign ſpiritually in the hearts of Men, till both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> ſhould ſubmit to his Scepter of righteouſneſs, and be govern'd by the Divine Laws of his heavenly Diſcipline. By this prime fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Prophecy, you ſee the purport of all the reſt; For nothing can be more expreſly foretold then is Chriſts <hi>Spiritual</hi> Kingdome in theſe words; Nor was ever the event of any Prophecy ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized.

So that I ſhall not need now to add any more upon this head unleſs it be to give you a ſhort,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96191:10"/>
but real view of that Kingdome in Chriſts own exerciſe and adminiſtration of it. Look there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into his <hi>Sermon</hi> on the <hi>Mount</hi> (I had rather you ſhould find it in your hearts then in your Books) where you ſhall diſcover a <hi>Perpetual Edict</hi> of that Law by which Chriſt will govern his Kingdome, and a <hi>Scheme</hi> of that Policy whereby it muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. A Divine Law, and a Policy all ſpirit. Had a <hi>Solon</hi> or <hi>Lycurgus</hi> been to lay the Plot and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of a Common-Wealth, you ſhould have ſeen an inſtitution apt to make their Citizens Rich, Politique and fierce, ſucceſsfull troublers of the World. Had <hi>Machiavel</hi> been the Contriver, he would have recommended Craft, Jealouſie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found diſſimulation, crooked Arts of Deceit and Circumvention; advanc'd Ambition, Avarice, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine and Bloud-ſhed, the vertues of the <hi>Iron</hi> age, and the accompliſhments of <hi>Caeſar Borgia.</hi> Theſe are the methods by which worldly Greatneſs is uſually acquired and maintained. But Chriſt founds his Kingdome on nobler Principles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's intereſts are of a ſublimer Nature. And therefore here, inſtead of anxious cares and fears, the ſollicitous plots and contrivances which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men ſet up as a <hi>Counter-Providence</hi> of their own, to check and controul that wiſdome which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes and ſuſtaines the World; We are taught, by retrenching and mortifying our deſires, to need little, and to be ſure of what we want by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96191:11"/>
asking it of God; And be happy, whether we obtaine our petitions or no, by our unconcerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for theſe outward things; Depending ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely on that goodneſs which ſuffers not a <hi>Sparrow</hi> to be unprovided for, nor a <hi>flower</hi> of the field to lack that nouriſhment and thoſe influences which are requiſite to maintain its verdure. In ſtead of that Ambition which makes men climb till they grow giddy, and moſt an end like Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons <hi>leſſen</hi> as they mount; We are directed how to find Honour in the Duſt, in that Humility which makes us like the coequal Son of God. Inſtead of Fraud, Lying, Hypocriſie, which uſe to be called <hi>Cunning,</hi> but are fripperies of folly (for ſure he that wants not wit hath no need to be a knave) Chriſtians are ſhew'd a ſtraighter way to their ends, by the rule of ſtrict ſevere juſtice, with honeſt upright intentions, ingenuous open ſingle hearts. Thus Chriſt builds his <hi>new</hi> and holy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> deſcending out of heaven from God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Revel. 21 11, 12 Iſa. 54, 11, 12.</note> to St <hi>Johns</hi> deſcription, and the elder deſigne of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> with <hi>Chriſtal, Saphyres, and Carbuncles,</hi> where every part is tranſparent and ſeen through by its own light; That which is all beauty, needs hide nothing, and when its brightneſs ought to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate others, muſt ſhine out; Twas onely ſinne made nakedneſs inconvenient and ſhamefull, and that innocence which Chriſt deſign'd to retrive, takes away the fig-leaves from before our minds
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96191:11"/>
as well as bodies, introducing a ſimplicity which fears not <hi>Momus</hi> his window and privy light into our ſouls; A charity, apt to keep out Breaſts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways open, ready to receive and cheriſh our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. In the place of falſe perficlious friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, thoſe kindneſſes which are but proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and baits for Treachery; Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth a real affectionate amity and good will even to enemies, whoſe <hi>Evil</hi> we are commanded to <hi>overcome with our good,</hi> being taught a new skill, by heaping our Love like <hi>Coals of fire upon their heads,</hi> to ſubdue their moſt obſtinate hardneſs, and melt them down into the ſame Maſſe of Chriſtian charity with our ſelves: And that no pretence be left of hating any perſon under the notion of enmity, the very name of Enemy, and of Stranger, is for ever baniſhed the World; <hi>The partition wall</hi> of Jewiſh uncharitableneſs raz'd and demoliſhed, and every man become brother to every man. Indeed no body can properly be an enemy to a Chriſtian, becauſe he cannot truly hurt him, unleſs the Chriſtians own ſin give a ſting and venome to the others malice. For what can the ſuppoſed enemy do?

You may now be ſure, Chriſts Kingdome is not of this World, which is in every inſtance ſo contrary to it; (I wiſh the ſame unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were not too obſervable among his profeſſed Subjects, who allow, but follow not his Rule;) and <hi>Pilate</hi> had reaſon enough to reſt ſecure, that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> though he aſſerted himſelf to be <hi>King,</hi> could on theſe terms be no dangerous Rival or Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor with <hi>Tiberius;</hi> ſuch a Kingdome might bleſs and proſper <hi>Caeſars</hi> Government, could not impeach his Power or diminiſh his Greatneſs.</p>

every way to have been ſuch a Perſon as all <hi>Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Types</hi> have fore-ſhewed, and to have been ſo uſed as they aſſure us he was to be, and no other is pretended to anſwer thoſe prefigurations in any degree, <hi>Pilate</hi> was as good a Prophet as <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and being over-ruled by the Spirit of God, wrote more then he underſtood, but not more then was true, in this Title and Recognition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth King of the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANd now perhaps ſome of you are ready to ſay, that I have ſpoken a great deal to my Text, but little to my Auditory: Why ſhould I bring you back to the firſt Elements of Chriſtianity, who have been baptized into <hi>Chriſts death</hi> in your infancy, grown up in the profeſsion of his Goſpel, have had Chriſt in many Sermons evidently ſet forth <hi>crucified</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and received him often in the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental repreſentation of his <hi>Death?</hi> After ſo many pledges of ſervice and love enterchanged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you, what reaſon have I to doubt of your being Chriſtians? I do not doubt it: But give me leave to tell you, There goes more to that then we generally imagine; every man is not a Chriſtian who believes his <hi>Creed,</hi> nor does every one believe the Creed who ſuppoſeth and takes it for granted: Many of us believe the <hi>Articles</hi> of our Faith as we do the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> or the ſtory of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War; we care not whether they be true or no: And ſuch have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96191:20"/>
need ſometimes to be catechized in the grounds, and more in the importance of their Faith. And many others who explicitely believe the Truth, are ſo far from <hi>obeying</hi> it, that they <hi>hold it in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> and <note place="margin">R m. 1.</note> theſe ought often to be told, that they believe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to condemn, but not enough to juſtifie and ſave them. Suppoſe then, that you have devoured all the ſcandal of the Croſs, and what is an <hi>offence</hi> to <hi>Jews,</hi> and to <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſhneſs, is to you the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power of God, the one appearing emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in the contrivance of this Myſtery, and the other in the great things wrought thereby. And now upon the whole matter, your armes are open to receive Chriſt, for the very reaſons which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the <hi>Jews</hi> to reject and ſcorn him: you can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern the <hi>Lord of Glory</hi> through the diſguiſe and form of a <hi>ſervant,</hi> contemplate him triumphing over the powers of Death and Hell in a ſervile ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crucifixion, and therefore, becauſe he came not down from the Croſs, you will believe him. Pardon me, if I ſay, you may do all this, and yet be <hi>Jews.</hi> To make it appear, let me mind you of the <hi>Jews</hi> miſcarriages in this behalf. We have found them blameable, 1. For not accepting <hi>Jeſus</hi> as their <hi>King:</hi> 2. In the reaſon why they refuſed him, Becauſe he he was a Spiritual, not a Temporal Prince. Be faithfull then to your own ſouls, and in this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſeaſon of ſelf-examination ask your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences theſe two Queſtions; 1. <hi>Whether you do ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96191:21"/>
own and receive Jeſus for your King?</hi> 2. If you find your ſelves faulty and deficient in that Duty, Whether the reaſon why you do not cordially em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him be any other then that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his <hi>Kingdome</hi> and his Laws are <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and you are Carnal? 1. Whether you do own and accept Chriſt for your King? I know you are apt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to admit his other Relations to you; every one hearkens willingly to the glad tidings of a Mediator and a Saviour: 'Tis pleaſant to think of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> conſiderable enough to atone for our ſins, of ſuch a <hi>High Prieſt</hi> entred within the vail interceding on our behalf at Gods right hand, who will ſurely be heard when he prays, and who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obtain'd eternal redemption forus. Nay we can like well that he be a King too, (provided that as his Kingdome is not of this world, ſo he trouble not us with it in this world, pretend not to govern us till we come to heaven. 'Tis not amiſs that he be powerfull enough to overcome our Enemies to <hi>ſpoil Principalities and Powers, lead captivity captive,</hi> and after that give <hi>gifts unto men,</hi> when he hath through his Death deſtroyed the Devil who had the power of Death, that he be able and willing to enſtate us in eternal life, and aſſume us to the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his Kingdom. Tell me now, I pray you, what temptation had the <hi>Jews,</hi> why they ſhould not be as good Chriſtians as we upon their own grounds, if this be all? what carnality of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96191:21"/>
theirs would have reſiſted the propoſition of ſuch a Sacrifice to expiate for their ſins? Why ſhould not a <hi>Phariſee</hi> be content that he might have an <hi>Advocate</hi> always pleading for him at the Throne of Grace? What could move the groſſeſt dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> to refuſe a reverſion of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory in heaven after the enjoyment of thoſe preſent ſelicities which he deſired on earth? There is ſomething ſurely more then this in the accepting and acknowledging Chriſt for our King, or elſe the Jewes would have accepted him too. The Duty of a ſubject to a <hi>Prince</hi> is expreſſed in one word, <hi>Obedience.</hi> The Tributes of our Eſteem, Honor, Reverence and Recognition, are good cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the performance of our main Duty; but without it are follies or crimes. I need not teach the Court how little <hi>Complements</hi> ſignifie, you know that for the moſt part they are like <hi>Nil's in a Cypher,</hi> us'd onely to amuſe, to conceal, not explain our minds: Nor ſhall I need to ſay here, the profeſſion of that Duty and ſervice which we mean not to performe, is no more then a <hi>Complement,</hi> unleſs it prove a ſcorne too; for in ſevere examination, to acknowledg our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns Power, and yet refuſe his commands, is at once to recognize and defie him; to call Chriſt our Prince, and not ſubmit to his rule and Laws, is but to bow before him, cry <hi>Hail King of the Jews,</hi> and <hi>crucifie him.</hi> Obedience hereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96191:22"/>
to be the natural neceſſary Duty of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a Prince, becauſe it ſupports and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the end of the Relation between them, enables the Prince to do his Office. It is the end of all Government, to procure the good of the whole Community; but no Governour can do that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be obeyed: without obedience, the Scepter is but a Reed in his hand, a Rod of weakneſs and contempt, not of power. 'Tis folly to expect to ſit quietly under our own <hi>Vines and Fig-trees,</hi> enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the benefits of peace and plenty, unleſs we conform to thoſe Laws which preſerve peace, and effect plenty, by regulating every man in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly purſuit of his own honeſt ends without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering with thoſe of his Neighbour. 'Tis mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to look that a <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>ſingle Perſon</hi> ſhould ſuppreſs <hi>Rebellions,</hi> repel the force of invading <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> drive <hi>Enemies Fleets</hi> from his Coaſts, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer them upon their own: But by the free and hearty obedience of his <hi>People,</hi> He can do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his whole Kingdom can do, Becauſe thereby their entire ſtrength is concentred in Him, and He can manage and employ it as eaſily as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his own body. The ſame obligation both of Duty and Intereſt have we to obey Chriſt; of Duty, that we defraud him not of what we owe him; and Intereſt, that he may be able to do us the good which he deſigns: For neither can he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his and our Enemies (to the purpoſes we are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96191:22"/>
concern'd in;) nor make his Subjects happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrence of their obedience. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſtroy the works of the Devil, if we will perſiſt to employ our ſelves in his works, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to be ſlaves ſtill, notwithſtanding all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty purchaſed for us, and when the Captain of our Salvation hath caſt down and bruis'd his head; made it eaſie and ſafe for us to tread upon our old Enemy, we ſet him up again, and fall down and worſhip him Nor can he bring us to heaven unleſs we conforme to the Laws and conditions by which we are to be advanced; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Kingdome firſt into us, that we may be afterwards received into it; For whatever God might have done, if we ſuppoſe a time before the method of our Redemption was decreed; It will be ſafe to ſay, that ſince he hath limited himſelf by an expreſs act and declaration of his will, and Covenanted with Chriſt, that upon his voluntary laying down his life as a ranſome for the World, he ſhould have power to beſtow the Kingdome upon ſuch, and ſuch onely as <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Repent,</hi> no man now can look to go to Heaven by Chriſt, but he whoſe Faith receives Chriſt for his King, and whoſe Repentance grieves for having offended him, and reſolves to ſerve him faithfully for the time to come. Theſe are the two joint inſeparable <hi>Conditions</hi> of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neither of which will ſingly avail us: For as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96191:23"/>
it is impoſſible to Repent without Faith, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the neceſſity and benefit of that Duty, ſo our Repentance it ſelf inſtructs us, that Faith alone is not our whole work; Becauſe we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not that we have no Faith (ſeeing we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Faith, to be the principle which moved us to repent) but we grieve to find our ſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in our obedience, that we have not perform'd what we believe our ſelves bound, and engaged to. For this is the proper buſineſs of Faith, to ſhew us our King, and direct us in our duty to him. If we onely believe the <hi>Theory</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, acknowledge the truth of all that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath taught, and no more, This makes Chriſt but ſuch a King as GROTIUS think's <hi>Pilate</hi> took <note place="margin">Grot, in Joh. 9. <hi>v.</hi> 38.</note> him for, a kind of <hi>Rex Stoicus,</hi> a Prince and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſome rare opinions and ſpeculative truths; and Chriſtianity it ſelf but a <hi>ſect</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> often calls it in a better ſenſe) combined in the aſſerting an excellent <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> not a Kingdom and body Politique, join'd to one Common head, by which all the members are guided in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life, and purſuance of real ſolid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Me thinks the Lawyers (who are verſed in matters of government) give us a good Notion of <hi>Faith,</hi> when they joyn it with, and make it Synonymous to True Allegiance. And a <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> from them would be ſeaſonable in this caſe, to track the exorbitances of ſome Divines, who
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96191:23"/>
evaporate all Religion in Notions. Had Chriſt been propoſed to us onely as Prophet, ſuch a Faith had been a hand fitter to receive him, it might have apprehended <hi>Viſions</hi> and Revelations well enough: but ſeeing he is a King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers <hi>commands,</hi> Obedience onely is relative to them. And we may believe St. <hi>James,</hi> who tells us, that <hi>Faith which works not,</hi> when tis bidden by ſuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <note place="margin">James 2. 26.</note> is <hi>Dead.</hi> The Faith which onely lives, and can make us do ſo, is that which expreſſeth it ſelf by lively operations, being animated and <note place="margin">

               <hi>actuated</hi> by an obedient <hi>Love,</hi> that Generous Principle which even in humane affairs noble produceth all the great and worthy things in the world, by thoſe Perſons who ſerve the Prince whom they <hi>love, vigorouſly</hi> and <hi>Bravely.</hi> That <hi>Obedience</hi> onely can bring us back to God, we may know by this, that Diſobedience caſt us out of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and preſence: and if the effect of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be to recover us the Paradiſe and the favour of of God, which we loſt at firſt by diſobeying his commands, it muſt alſo put us into a ſtate of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, without which we cannot be capable of recovery, the <hi>Cherubim</hi> with their flaming ſword will ſtill fight againſt us upon the old quarrel; and it muſt find a way to help us in that ſtate, or elſe we ſhall quickly loſe all again. It was very agreeable to the Majeſty and goodneſs of God, to compaſſionate the weakneſs of his poor <hi>Lapſed</hi> Creature ſo far, as to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96191:24"/>
make our task eaſie and proportion'd to our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, to accept ſincere honeſt endeavours inſtead of exact unerring obedience, which <hi>Adam</hi> fail'd of, and we in the ruine of our nature could by no mean have performed. But to be reconciled to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> is inconſiſtent with every one of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; even goodneſs it ſelf would ceaſe to be good, ſhould it Patronize and encourage evil; now diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is all Evil, tranſgreſſeth and violates the whole Law at once, <hi>The ſoul that doth ought preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Num. 15. 30, 31.</note> diſobeying with a high hand, <hi>reproacheth</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> and deſpiſeth his comandments. I may add, and his Mercy and Grace too, which are afforded to invite and help us to obey, and would not have been given us to that purpoſe, were diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by any means reconcileable to our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Gods favour: And between Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Diſobedience I know no <hi>Medium;</hi> That pretence of ſerving Chriſt out of <hi>Gallantry</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I confeſs my ſelf not acute enough to underſtand, any further, then as a colour for not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him at all. For <hi>precarious Authority</hi> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in Terms; the Prince who hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a Tenant at will, holds his Crown and Dignity in a kind of <hi>Villenage,</hi> and ſervile depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the Pleaſure of his Subjects; and where Chriſt hath no greater command then ſo, he may be any thing elſe, but cannot be a King. My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be not deceived; though <hi>God ſo loved the world
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96191:24"/>
as to give his onely begotten Son to die for us;</hi> yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he loved his Son whom he ſent from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, infinitely more then all the world for whom he gave him; and therefore will be ſure to provide for his honour before our ſafety: To which purpoſe, we ſee he hath ſetled his Kingdom on ſuch terms, as that we ſhall not have the benefits we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, unleſs he have from us the glory due to him. We cannot be ſaved, unleſs he be obeyed; and we become ſo far both his Servants and Friends, as to do whatſoever he commands us. God will certainly aſſert his own <hi>Laws,</hi> and vindicate his Sons <hi>Honour;</hi> and that may be done, whatever becomes of us: Chriſt may be glorified even in our deſtruction, and will be ſo, if we envy him the glory of ſaving us: He will ſhew himſelf a King in puniſhing our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, if we bereave him of the delight of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding and crowning our Obedience. His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom cannot ſtand, to the effecting its gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of making us happy, if it be ſo divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf, as that our perverſeneſs draws one way, while his Precepts direct us another: Nor to the preſervation of his Majeſty, if he be ſo divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, as to prevaricate in the execution of his own Laws, ſuffer our diſobedience to prevail over his Juſtice, and eſcape the puniſhment denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt it, that <hi>Death which we chooſe and ſeek in the error of our ways.</hi> Let us therefore be wiſe, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the good Advice long ſince given to Mankind in

               <note place="margin">Loca ſup. citat. de Divinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, l. 2.</note> Let us obey faithfully and in good earneſt the King whom we own and acknowledge; yield the ſame compliance to his Rule and Government which we give every thing elſe under whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we are. Even our follies may counſel us in this; our ſins may inform and direct us to the way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming righteouſneſs; ſerve but God as heartily as you do the Devil, and it will be well. While <hi>ſin reigns in our mortal bodies, we obey it in all the luſts thereof.</hi> One fleſhly appetite bids us <hi>go,</hi> and <hi>we go;</hi> another calls us to <hi>come,</hi> and <hi>we come</hi> at a beck; a third commands us to <hi>do this,</hi> and <hi>we do it</hi> readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without ſtop or heſitancy, Ambition makes us ſlaves, in hope of being Princes; We become flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and paraſites to great perſons, and if one of them ſtrike us <hi>on the right cheek,</hi> we haſtily <hi>turn to him the left,</hi> eſteeming his ſcornfull blows as <hi>healing</hi> as the KINGS <hi>Touch.</hi> Our <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> condemns us to the mines, ſends us to the confines of Hell, and we often break into the bowels of it to fetch Treaſure, and we bring up with labour and hazard our Idol Gold from them, which we conſecrate for a God in our hearts, and ſerve it with far more Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then the Lord of heaven and earth.

us of our <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>hands,</hi> and we chuſe rather to go to Hell, <hi>blinde</hi> or <hi>maimed,</hi> then having all our <hi>Members</hi> to enter into <hi>Glory.</hi> Why do we not obey Chriſt at this rate? Why do we love to be the Slaves and <hi>Martyrs of the Devil</hi> and Damnation, abhorring the free and happy Service of Chriſt. 'Tis not becauſe his wages is inconſiderable; for eternal life is the reward of ſuch <hi>as obey him.</hi> Nor that his commands are <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>intolerable;</hi> for they are <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> in the Lord: Preſent happineſs in themſelves, and pledges of future glory. I ſhould diſparage the excellency of Chriſts preſcriptions by ſaying, That as much as Health is better then a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo much is Sobriety better then Drunkenneſs; which often recompenſes the jolly, voluntary madneſs of one hour, with the indiſpoſition and uneaſineſs, at leaſt, if not greater inconvenience of many years. If a laſting vigorous conſtitution of <hi>Body,</hi> a conſtant ſerenity of <hi>Minde,</hi> a Soul firm and lively in all its faculties; an active Manhood, a venerable Wiſe, length of days, be more eligible, then early Gouts and <hi>Catarrh</hi>'s; a decrepit uſeleſs youth, a wretched contemptible old Age before its time; a Soul always looſe and unhinged, a Minde ſottiſh in debates, and brutiſh in its reſolutions, unable to give or take counſel; then is the perpetual feaſt of <hi>Temperance</hi> more inviting, then the loads of Gluttonous meats, and the killing debauches and riots of Luxury and Incontinence. <hi>Heathen</hi> Philoſophy could have made
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96191:26"/>
theſe compariſons, and carried them by inſtances through the whole Scheme of <hi>Ethicks;</hi> or rather it would have diſdained that <hi>Vertue</hi> ſhould be at all compared, either with the filthy nature of <hi>Vice,</hi> or its pernicious conſequences. And I hope a Chriſtian converſation will appear in all reſpects to tranſcend Heathen Morality, as far as that is above the dirt and mire of the moſt brutiſh ſenſuality. The ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of a regular orderly life led, <hi>ſecundum Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cic. de Fin. paſſim.</note> which is all Philoſophy aims at, are much more agreeable then thoſe low and vile diſorders which ſome men deſire to wallow in; but infinitely ſhort of thoſe heavenly joys, wherewith mindes il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated by the Holy Ghoſt, furniſhed and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Graces, are continually entertained; beſide, that this <hi>Paradiſe</hi> they now enjoy, is the way to <hi>Heaven,</hi> this ſerving and walking with God in a delightful affluence of pleaſures, is but their pledge and aſſurance of being tranſlated in time to live with him for ever. Nor yet is our employment diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable and baſe; for our Lord requires us to do nothing, but what himſelf hath done before us. 'Tis true that <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <q>
                  <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> are neither ſo compendious, nor efficacious a way to <note place="margin">Epiſt. 6.</note> teach Vertue, as when we ſee the thing it ſelf exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in actions adorned with all the advantage and life of Circumſtances, and real Demonſtrations;</q> we apprehend better ſuch ſolid repreſentations, and are affected more, when we perceive our Teacher
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96191:26"/>
believes himſelf, and practiſeth what he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends; and men, in all caſes, follow cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when their leaders firſt attempt difficulties, endure hardſhips, and undertake dangers in their own Perſons: All theſe Invitations we have from Chriſt. He is himſelf the <hi>Rule</hi> of all he teacheth; the <hi>Example</hi> of all he commands; the Inſtance and <hi>Pledg</hi> of all he hath promiſed: We may learn of him to be meek and lowly; for he hath dignified that humility by debaſing and emptying himſelf, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought a vice, and we account a <note place="margin">Eth. Nicons. l. 2. c. 7.</note> folly; He hath <hi>conſecrated</hi> that Poverty in his own wants and deſtitutions, which we fear more then death; He hath <hi>ſanctified</hi> Afflictions in his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, honoured <hi>contempt</hi> and ſcorn by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled and ſpit upon, and placed a <hi>Crown</hi> for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom upon his Croſs; He hath conquered Death by ſubmitting to it, and made it now a way to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, of which his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> are our certain Pledges. What then is the reaſon, why after all this we are unwilling to learn the beſt things, follow the nobleſt, moſt alluring ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, embrace the moſt precious rewards under the conduct and government of this our King? The very ſame thing cauſeth our backwardneſs which made the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo refractory and untoward before us; the things propoſed to us are ſpiritual, and we are carnal. I doubt not but R. <hi>Akiba</hi> thought much better of <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom he helped to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96191:27"/>
condemn and crucifie, then of <hi>Barcochab,</hi> whoſe Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire he made himſelf in that fatal Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> but the one gave him hopes of enjoying the worldly things which he loved, the other would have taught him to contemn them, which was a hard leſſon to a Carnal Man. And we may believe, the <hi>Jews</hi> now deſire that <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> whom they look for, and yet ſome of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him before-hand for the reaſon that Chriſt was refuſed by their Fathers. <hi>Fagius</hi> tells us, divers of <note place="margin">Fag. in Deut. 23</note> them confeſſed to him that they would not have <hi>Meſsiah</hi> come in their days, becauſe the <hi>Law</hi> would oblige them to forſake their <hi>Uſury,</hi> being return'd to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and having no ſtrangers left on whom to exerciſe it. Juſt ſo it is with us; we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved by ſtrong habits and the power of ſin, and ſo not free to apply our ſelves to a better Maſter; we are <hi>bored through the ear,</hi> and cannot abide to change, though for liberty; we have ſo long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our ſenſes, and fleſhly appetites, that our ſouls themſelves are grown fleſh: Being uſed to <hi>Leeks</hi> and <hi>Onions,</hi> groſs foul feeding, we loath <hi>Manna</hi> as inſipid <hi>light Bread;</hi> reliſh not ſpiritual delights, becauſe they are too ſubtil and too pure, food rather for Angels then Men. And as ſpiritual entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are too fine, ſo ſpiritual commands, which undertake to purge the heart and ſoul, are too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere for fleſh and blood. <hi>Repentance</hi> is a grim Duty; Mortification, that Metaphorical death, is to us
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96191:27"/>
like the true one, <hi>a King of Terrours;</hi> Becauſe to our fleſhly concupiſcences it is a true and real Death, brings out thoſe Enemies of Chriſt which will not let him reign over them, and ſlays them before his face. For this ſad and killing malady, this ſpiritual madneſs of ours, I know but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: Had we the ſame reſerve of Reaſon in our diſtemper, as had that mad <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> who leaped into the Water, which the nature of his Diſeaſe made him abhor, we might finde a cure as he did: could we be perſwaded (for trials ſake) to take up Chriſts yoke a while, we ſhould ſoon find it an Inſtrument not made to load and gall our necks, but to eaſe and defend us from the preſſure of our burden; we ſhould diſcover, that no one Precept hath been given us by Chriſt, but to make our life more comfortable, and our duty more agreeable. <hi>Meekneſs</hi> was preſcribed to allay the ſtorms of Anger, to preſerve a <hi>Perſon</hi> of that Dignity that every Chriſtian is, from diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf, forfeiting his Reaſon and his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Man-kind at every little accident, and to caſt out the Devil of Rage, which makes us foam and tear our ſelves, and place us quiet, and in our <hi>right minds at the feet of Chriſt.</hi> Not to <hi>look</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, as an expedient to make the ancient Duty of not <hi>luſting</hi> more practicable, it being much eaſier to keep a houſe from burning before then after the fire is kindled in it. <hi>Reſignation</hi> and Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96191:28"/>
are commanded, to deliver us from the Rack of covetous and impatient Deſires,, and to be our Sanctuary in all diſtreſſes. <hi>Humility</hi> will prevent Quarrels, and <hi>Mercifulneſs</hi> will end them as ſoon as they begin. <hi>Charity</hi> will reconcile us to God and Man, and the Duty ſhall I call it? or Priviledge? of doing all the good we can to mens bodies and ſouls, is a Dignity and a pleaſure (I had almoſt ſaid) too great for mortal Men; it makes us Kings and Prieſts, nay, Angels, the miniſters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyers of Gods mercies and graces, and ſubordinate Saviours to one another; anticipating our future <hi>joys</hi> and <hi>bleſſedneſs,</hi> giving us before-hand that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which alone ſhall poſſeſs our ſouls in Heaven, <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>univerſal Love.</hi> The Apoſtles themſelves were carnal enough, unapt to entertain the Spiritual part of Chriſts Doctrine and Kingdom; continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even after the Reſurrection, to expect an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Acts 1. 6,</note> Rule under him: But when the Holy Ghoſt had enlightened their Minds, and rack'd their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from this Earth and Lees, then they ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed all the allurements of the World, ſcorn'd them as droſs and dung, accounted nothing happy or pleaſant but to ſerve Chriſt, nothing great and honourable but to ſuffer and die for him. The ſame <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> did we not check and ſtifle his good motions, unkindly <hi>grieve him</hi> by refuſing and <hi>reſiſting</hi> his Addreſſes and Courtſhips to our ſouls, would work the ſame bleſſed effects on us,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96191:28"/>
give us a true taſte and delightfull reliſh of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al excellencies; convince us, that nothing is ſo lovely as innocence, that harmleſs Dove-like tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; nothing ſo happy as a Conſcience always <hi>at peace with it ſelf</hi> and <hi>with God;</hi> nothing ſo honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as to ſerve Chriſt, whoſe Injunctions are but ſo many ſteps and degrees whereby we aſcend near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and nearer to God: Aſſure us, that <hi>Repentance</hi> it ſelf is but the caſting off an intolerable Burden, <hi>Mortification</hi> but the pulling a <hi>Thorn</hi> out of our Fleſh, which grew there from the Curſe; ſubduing that Rebel part which is always infeſting our quiet, and giving us an entire Dominion over our luſts, which Heathen <hi>Moraliſts</hi> ſay is the greateſt Empire that mortal men are capable of; and in ſum, that there can be no objection againſt that Obedience which makes our Lives comfortable, and Death it ſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> this would eſtabliſh ſuch a practice of Chriſtianity as might remove the onely ſcandalous obſtacle of the <hi>Jews converſion.</hi> At this day they ſay, Chriſtians themſelves keep them from being Chriſtians, add a new offence to the Croſs, which lay not in the way of their Fathers; By not living <hi>ſuch lives</hi> as the <hi>Prophets</hi> fore-told ſhould be the effect of <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s Government, and as Chriſt's own Doctrine and undertaking gave the World ground to expect. <q>What ſhall I do? (ſays a <hi>poor doubting Jew,)</hi> I ſee, after ſo many Ages of vain 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96191:29"/>
which our Doctors talk of; and indeed, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> did ſo well anſwer all the Characters ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in Scripture, that I began to turn my thoughts toward him: But alas, I perceive his own Scholars do not believe him: They perſecute us indeed for <hi>blaſpheming his Name,</hi> and yet they give us every day new cauſe to blaſpheme him; and not onely think him an <hi>Impoſter,</hi> becauſe we ſee nothing come to paſſe which he promiſed, no meekneſſe, no humility, no patience, no innocence, and eſpecially none of that love which he told us ſhould be the badge and cognizance of his Diſciples. But on the contrary, all the vices reign among the Profeſſors of the Goſpel, which <hi>Jeſus</hi> profeſſed he came to extirpate and drive out of the world. How can we chooſe but ſpeak evil of His Name, when Chriſtians lye, and cozen, and ſwear falſly by it; call his name over all their wickedneſſes and luſts; ſlander, backbite, ſupplant, rob and murder one another, and all in <hi>Chriſts Name,</hi> do all thoſe things for which <hi>no Sacrifice</hi> will expiate with us, and which <hi>Heathen</hi> honeſty abhors to hear of, for Chriſts ſake, and in zeal to his Glory. If Chriſt taught theſe things, he deſerves all the Reproaches and Curſes which any <hi>Jew</hi> can lay upon him; and if he did not, where ſhall I be inſtructed in his Doctrine, for Chriſtians ſeem to think he did teach them.</q>
               <q>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me, I pray, with ſome anſwer to this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in charity to this <hi>Jew,</hi> for your own credit,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96191:29"/>
and for <hi>Chriſts</hi> honour; nay, help me, I pray you, to defend mine own Sermon. For perhaps <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jew</hi> will ſay, I am willing to think God did not intend <hi>Meſsiah</hi> a Temporal Kingdom, But hath your Jeſus any where a Spiritual one? You have proved his <hi>Title,</hi> But where is his Poſſeſſion? Can he have a Kingdom without Subjects? Perhaps he ought to reign, but I would be glad to ſee that he does: I would joyn my ſelf to a Church, not to a fancy and <hi>Roſecrucian</hi> inviſible ſociety, which ſubſiſts onely in imagination. The <hi>Prophets</hi> have told us, that <hi>Meſsiah</hi> ſhall <hi>ſee of his ſeed:</hi> I would be <note place="margin">Iſai. 53. 10.</note> glad to ſee it too, and <hi>that the pleaſure of the Lord did proſper in his hand.</hi> But certainly, you Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>our Meſsiah,</hi> not your own; for all your aims, endeavours and affections are fixed upon worldly advantages, and ſatisfactions of the fleſh; and while your diſcourſes deſtroy the <hi>Temporal</hi> Dominion of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and your lives his Spiritual, you ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm me, that <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth is</hi> not <hi>King of the Jews.</hi>
               </q> Theſe objections cannot be taken off by any way but one; the Reformation of our lives, the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in our actions, as well as words, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which Chriſts Doctrine, Example, Graces, and holy Ordinances were deſigned to plant and keep up.
