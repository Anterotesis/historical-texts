            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Sermon being the laſt which I had the Honor to preach before our late Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign of bleſſed and immortal Memory; and having been ſo well approv'd of by Him, that I receiv'd his Commands twice for the printing of it, and his Defence of it after it was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I now again preſent to publick View, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome apprehenſion of danger; for if, notwithſtanding the Royal Command and Defence of that Sagacious Prince, I could not at that time eſcape the ſevere ſtrokes of ſome Potent Men, who from the very moment it was firſt preach'd, by ſecret Arts endeavour'd my ruine, and became my Enemies for no other reaſon, but becauſe I told them the truth: I have little reaſon to expect bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſage now, being to my unſpeakable grief deſtitute of that Royal Patronage.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of it is to vindicate that Church-Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which our Lord, before he went into his far Country, in a moſt ſolemn manner conferr'd upon his Apoſtles, and which was to deſcend upon their Succeſſors, and to be continued in the Governors and Guides of the Church unto the end of the World; to leſſen, if not render uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this Sacred Authority, eſpecially that part of it, which conſiſts in expounding the Scriptures, in teaching and guiding the Flock; ſome modern Divine (for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb facs="tcp:53972:3"/>
beſt known to themſelves) have advanc'd the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity of Scripture to that degree, that not only the leſs difficult part thereof, but even the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are become eaſie and intelligible to every Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Reader. And it may ſeem ſtrange, that this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clearneſs of Scripture, unknown to thoſe Illuſtrious Fathers, who writ in the firſt and ſucceeding Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, who with indefatigable Labour, painful Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and inceſſant Recourſe to the Spirit of Truth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to explain the deep Myſteries thereof, ſhould never be diſcovered until theſe laſt Centuries, and then made uſe of to uſher in, and ſupport thoſe peſtilent Schiſms which happened in the Weſtern Churches, and is indeed ſet as a fatal Bar to fruſtrate all the Methods of Re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and yet ſtranger, that theſe Diſcoverers ſhould be ſo wilfully blind, as not to diſcern, that nothing is more clearly reveal'd, or more expreſly ſet down in Holy Writ, than the Authority here contended for, if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and concurrent Teſtimony of the Evangeliſts may be thought of any moment in the caſe.</p>
            <p>God forbid the Bread of Life ſhould be denied to the Children of the Goſpel Covenant; but whether the great Maſter of the Houſhold has not appointed Spiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be the Stewards and Diſpenſers of this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Food, or left the Children to be their own Carvers, ought to have been more maturely conſider'd; for this Bread of Life, which is the Word of God, is by St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to a two-edged Sword, and if that be put into the
<pb facs="tcp:53972:3"/>
hands of unskilful Managers, it may prove both fatal to themſelves, and deſtructive to others.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here trouble you with a review of thoſe Complaints, occaſioned by the dire Hereſies, which ſoon followed upon the firſt Tranſlation of the Bible into the Engliſh Tongue; ſince the Divine Writings cannot be tranſlated into too many Languages, and ſince after the Tranſlation, the Supreme Authority might have hindred the miſchiefs which inſued, by reſtraining the promiſcuous reading of them, and indulging that Priviledge to thoſe only who ſhould be licens'd thereunto by the Governours of the Church.</p>
            <p>But certainly thoſe men had no very good Deſign, nor a due Honour for the Divine Oracles, who firſt expos'd their myſterious meaning to the Judgment of every vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Capacity; and yet I would willingly entertain ſo much Charity for them, as to believe the firſt Inventors did not foreſee the dangerous Conſequences of their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; for from hence it naturally follows, in the Firſt place, That there is no neceſſity of Church-Guides for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting Chriſtians in neceſſary Faith. Secondly, From hence follows a contempt of their Function, at leaſt as to this part of it, (for who will regard that Authority which is made uſeleſs;) Thirdly, An Innundation of all thoſe wild Opinions, which either Malice or Ignorance can betray men into. Fourthly, The multiplying of Sects and Hereſies, without any due Means left for the ſuppreſſing them, ſince every ſincere Endeavourer may equally plead
<pb facs="tcp:53972:4"/>
the Truth of Scripture in juſtification of his Opinion.</p>
            <p>This one Principle has turned our <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was once a City at <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity within it ſelf, into a <hi>Babel,</hi> not of Languages, (but what is worſe) a Confuſion of the groſſeſt Errors which ever infeſted the Church ſince the Foundation of Chriſtianity; and ſince Latitudiniſm in Principles, is evermore accompanied with Libertiniſm in Practice, Schiſm in the Church begets Sedition in the Monarchy, and an Eraſtian in the one, proves a Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can in the other. To this one Principle may be chiefly aſcrib'd all the Fatal miſchiefs of the late unnatural Wars, and the dreadful Confuſions intended by the laſt Fanatick Conſpiracy, which we ſo narrowly eſcap'd, that we can ſcarce yet think our ſelves ſecure from the danger of it: for ſince the Tranſlation of the Bible into our Language, and the promiſcuous Reading of it, what Schiſmatick ever wanted a Text, of his own interpreting, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his Schiſm? or Rebel, to authorize his Rebellion?</p>
            <p>The Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Catholick Church, ought to be dearer to every good Chriſtian, than the greateſt temporal Bleſſings, or even Life it ſelf: How far this has been obſtructed by the envenom'd Writings and Era<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian Principles of ſome modern Controvertiſts, I wiſh we had not too juſt cauſe to lament; and that in their Tranſports of indiſcreet Zeal, and even inhuman<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Chap. 2.</hi> not contented to juſtifie our Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the account of Innovations, Corruptions, and impoſing them as neceſſary Conditions of Communion, and ſo becoming guilty of cauſal Schiſm, they have repreſented all the Members of that Church, both Paſtors and People, both in Doctrin and Practice, guilty of Heatheniſh, and worſe than the moſt ſottiſh Heatheniſh Idolatry; ſo foul a Charge, and ſo injurious to that Charity which the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath always been renown'd for, that I hope the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it may have Grace to retract, and make ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for that Scandal which is thereby given even to our
<pb facs="tcp:53972:5"/>
common Chriſtianity. And I have always wondred, how it ever could enter into the heart of any man to believe, and publickly maintain, that ſo great a number of Chriſtian Profeſſors, eminent for Learning, and Auſterity of Life, could be guilty of ſo damnable an Apoſtaſie: concerning the miſchiefs of this Charge, take the Judgment of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Thorndike,</hi> in the laſt words of the firſt Chapter of his juſt Weights and Meaſures: <hi>And as they who ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the Reformation by charging the Pope to be Antichriſt, and the Papiſts Idolaters; ſo, on the other ſide, they who over-charge the Reformation to be Hereticks, make themſelves thereby Schiſmaticks before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We hope no ingenuous Perſon, though an Adverſary, will think the worſe of the true Sons of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the uncharitable Opinions of ſome particular Men, deſcended perhaps from diſſenting Parents, educated in diſſenting Times, and who never yet ſufficiently conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prejudices of their Education; if they had, they would not maintain ſuch Eraſtian Poſitions as theſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That Chriſt never appointed any particular Form of Church-Government, but left it arbitrary, and dependent on the Civil State. That Chriſt Jeſus is not to be preach'd, if the Magiſtrate and the Law of the Country forbid it. That the King has a Power to execute all Paſtoral Offices, &amp; devolve it on others, with many others of the like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence, which that valiant Champion of Church-Power, Mr. <hi>Lowth,</hi> has charg'd upon them, and
<pb facs="tcp:53972:5"/>
learnedly made good the Charge; whereas concerning the laſt of theſe Poſitions, neither his preſent M. nor any of his Predeceſſors, by virtue of their Eccleſiaſtical Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ever thought themſelves indow'd with any other Power, but that of Nurſing Fathers; neither do's the true ſence of the Oath inveſt the Civil Magiſtrate with any other power in Spiritual Matters, than what is purely external and coercive, if Biſhop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> and others, may be thought of equal Authority with the Authors there tax'd; let them conſider in this very juncture of time the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their own Poſitions, and then lay their hands upon their mouths, and be for ever after ſilent: or if they pleaſe to look backward, let them conſider what miſchiefs the Fathers of the Church had brought upon themſelves, had they been of this Opinion, when <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> reign'd; had they ſpent as much time in defending the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as they have in oppoſing the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they would have prov'd themſelves as good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Father of their Country, and as dutiful Sons to their Mother the Church; had they given a true account of ancient Church-Government, inſtead of imbroyling us with <hi>Irenicum</hi>'s and Weapon-ſalves, they had purchas'd as much Renown to themſelves, and more Benefit to Chriſt's Catholick Church; then might we hope to ſee the Miſchiefs of Separation diſplay'd, without a Preface of ſuch Conceſſions as manifeſtly tend to the deſtruction of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity: and if it be a ſign of a luke-warm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous temper to deſert a Friend in affliction, that cruel juncture of time in which thoſe Conceſſions were made,

does no ways extenuate the Preſumption, for it deſerves no milder a Name; for any private Doctor, let his Fame he never ſo great, to aſſume to himſelf a more than Papal Power, to dictate <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> preſcribe to the Church, and unfix what has been eſtabliſht by her venerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, generally receiv'd and approv'd by all her true Subjects; then might we not deſpair to behold and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Beauty of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in all her heights of Decency and Order; her Doctrins believ'd; her Liturgies daily frequented; her Sacraments fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently celebrated; her Rubricks duly obſerv'd; her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected Diſcipline reſtored; her Cenſures dreaded; her Governours religiouſly obey'd: then might we not deſpair to ſee our Controverſies in Religion manag'd with all due deference to the Authority of ancient Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, general Tradition, and the conſent of the Catholick Church, and conſequently with a deſign to maintain uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Truths, rather than our own private Opinions; to confute mens Errors, rather than expoſe their Perſons; and a return of that Chriſtian Spirit which enobled the Writings of <hi>Caſſander, Grotius, Forbes,</hi> and many other Illuſtrious Conciliators, the decay whereof hath widen'd our Breaches, and obſtructed that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion which ought to be the earneſt deſire, &amp; endeavor of every good Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>If the Church of <hi>England</hi> do's not flouriſh as much in our days, as ever it did ſince the firſt Reformation, the fault muſt be in our ſelves, ſince His Majeſty, in his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Declaration, has paſt his Royal Word for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Government both of Church and State, as
<pb facs="tcp:53972:6"/>
it is now by Law eſtabliſhed, and we cannot in Honor, or Duty require more, ſince his Word has always been as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and inviolable to him, as his Perſon and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ought to be to us; wherefore inſtead of ſomenting needleſs Fears and Jalouſies concerning our Religion, which even in a Coffee-Houſe is dangerous, but from the Pulpit do's naturally riſe into Diſorders and Tumults; the people are to be taught the Duties of Submiſſion, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and Obedience to their Governors, both Civil and Spiritual, that as Religion is not to be propagated by Force, ſo neither is it lawful to take up Arms againſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority in defence of it; they are to be inſtructed in the Duties of Paſſive Obedience, and non-reſiſtance, from the Doctrines of the Scripture, the Principles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians, when under the ſevereſt Perſecutions.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Declaration He is pleas'd further to add, That He knows the Principles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are for Monarchy, and the Members of it have ſhew'd themſelves good and loyal Subjects; therefore he will always take care to defend and ſupport it: ſo that out of his abundant Goodneſs and Clemency, he has confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Word by the ſureſt Tyes of Intereſt and Princely Gratitude.</p>

for the <hi>Commandments of God,</hi> and humane <hi>Inventions</hi> receive the ſtamp of Divine <hi>Authority</hi>; whereby men ſeem precluded the genuine methods of coming to the Knowledge of the Truth, and thoſe Precepts of <hi>ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>Scriptures, ſeeking</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Heaven, <hi>trying</hi> the <hi>Spirits,</hi> are rendred Ineffectual; whereby men are ſo far from being able to give an <hi>account</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> that their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings</hi> are enſlav'd by a Principle of <hi>blind Obedience</hi>; ſo far from being led into the ways of Religion, by the <hi>cords of men,</hi> that they ſeem rather to be driven like Beaſts, and acted like Puppets, as 'tis phras'd by a late Author.</p>
            <p>As this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Clearneſs of Scripture,</hi> hath prov'd ſucceſsful to the beating down the pretences to an abſolute <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and uncontroulable Soveraignty over the Conſciences of men: ſo on the other hand hath it mightily embolden'd the <hi>Patrons of Liberty,</hi> not only to deſpiſe their Eccleſiaſtical Superiors, to throw off all obedience to Chriſt's Miniſters; [Whom He, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a little before his Return to his Fathers Court, for the further negotiating, and advancing the affairs of His Church, Anointed and Ordain'd to perform the Apoſtolical Offices, of <hi>Preaching</hi> the <hi>Goſpel; Remitting Sins; Inflicting Cenſures</hi>; Miniſterially <hi>conferring the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; Deciding Controverſies,</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> in his ſtead, here on earth till his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] but likewiſe to invade their Function, uſurp their Sacred Calling; eſpecially that part of it which conſiſts in Preaching and Expounding the Word.</p>
            <p>For, ſay they, ſince 'tis confeſs'd, the Scriptures are ſufficiently clear to all unprejudiced minds, ſuch as are free from the clogs of Paſſion and Intereſt; Why ſhould theſe pretended <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt</hi> take ſo much upon them? Are not all the <hi>Congregation Holy, and Learned, as well as they?</hi> Are they the only <hi>Temples of the Holy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53972:8"/>
Ghoſt?</hi> And doth the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy reſide</hi> ſolely in their Breaſts?</p>
            <p>During the Diſpenſation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 'tis confeſs'd, there was a neceſſity of an <hi>Aaron</hi>; all along under the Legal oeconomy, the Prieſts Lips did preſerve Knowledge; and likewiſe during the Reign of the Prophets, there was an appropriate Miniſtry. But the caſe is quite different under the Goſpel, God having made clearer diſcoveries of himſelf, and poured out more liberally of his Spirit upon all Fleſh. The ſenſe of the Law that was Doubtful, Typical and Myſterious; the Prophecies were induſtriouſly couch'd under dark Parables, and deliver'd in obſcure ſayings. But then the light, the glorious light of the Goſpel, as 'twas univerſal, 'twas likewiſe ſo clear, that any one that runs may read. Why then ſhould we not aſſert that <hi>Liberty</hi> wherewith Chriſt hath made us free? and ſince we have a Command, to work out our own Salvation, Why ſhould we pin our Faith upon other mens ſleeves?</p>
            <p>Thus theſe men, under the goodly Pretences of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty,</hi> become enſlav'd to ſpiritual pride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs; plead the Prerogative of the Goſpel, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Chriſt's own Ambaſſadors; urge, for their own private Conceptions, clearneſs of Scripture, to their own Confuſion, and pry ſo long into the Doctrines of Theology, till at length they light on thoſe <hi>hidden My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,</hi> which they being <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable,</hi> Wreſt unto their own Deſtruction. The way thus prepar'd, my Text yet leads me into theſe following Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the clearneſs of Scripture doth no ways leſſen the Authority, or take away the Neceſſity of Spiritual Guides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That though the Scriptures be clear in themſelves, yet private men, abandoning</hi> their <hi>Lawful Guides, and following their own Corrupt Fancies, may deprave and diſtort them to their own Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53972:9"/>3. <hi>That for preventing Miſtakes from riſing, and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Errors when riſen, 'tis the duty of Private men to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Judgments in matters of Religion, to the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of thoſe whom God hath conſtituted to be their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Guides and Governours; unleſs it manifeſtly appear, that ſuch Determinations are contrary to Gods Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I begin with the Firſt, <hi>That the Clearneſs of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> &amp;c. For, if the Scriptures be ſo Clear, and Self-evident, as is pretended, then may men with greater ſecurity rely on the Directions of their <hi>Guides</hi>; and they have the leſs Reaſon to ſuſpect their Conduct in thoſe things, wherein they themſelves being Judges, they cannot be miſtaken, if they ſincerely attend them; the clearneſs of the Law is ſo far from leſſening the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that it rather conciliates reverence to the Judge. The Profeſſion of Phyſick doth not therefore become uſeleſs, becauſe the Aphoriſms of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> contain the neceſſary Rules for Health; and may be underſtood by thoſe who are capacitated, and will take the pains to do it.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures they do clearly contain the <hi>Doctrines of Salvation:</hi> And one way, whereby Chriſt prov'd himſelf the true Meſſias, was by anſwering that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter the Prophets had given of Him, that the Poor ſhould have the Goſpel Preached unto them, <hi>i. e.</hi> Men as of ſmall Capacities, and leſs Eſtates, ſo of humble and teachable Diſpoſitions; men who are Poor in Spirit, as well as in Fortune: And the perfection of the <hi>Chriſtian Law</hi> conſiſts in this, that therein God hath preſcribed a reaſonable ſervice. The Rules of Life, which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in laid down, are not ſo much the product of abſolute Power and Soveraignty; as the Reſult of infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Goodneſs. And theſe His Attributes led Him to conſult the wants, and commiſerate the Neceſſities of the meaneſt of Mankind: And therefore, as when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53972:9"/>
He took upon Him to deliver Man, He did not abhor the Virgins Womb; and that He might become a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for Sin, was content to be diſarray'd of His own Eternal Glory, to take upon Him the Form of a Servant, and to humble Himſelf to the Death, the ſhameful Death of the Croſs: ſo likewiſe when He took upon Him the Office of a <hi>Teacher,</hi> by a wonderful Condeſcent, He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated His <hi>Doctrines</hi> to the Reaſon and humane Affections of His Auditors. His Laws obtain'd as much by their ſuitableneſs to our Natures, as the Authority of the Speaker. When He preach'd His <hi>Divine Sermon</hi> to the Multitude, He did not amuſe them with Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Theology, or torture their Underſtandings with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Subtilties; but as He was the <hi>Brightneſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Glory,</hi> and the <hi>expreſs Image of His Perſon</hi>; ſo He declar'd the Law of God in a moſt Plain and Perſpicuous manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> indeed, that grand Impoſtor, was well Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd to pen his Alcoran in ſwelling Words, and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Phraſes; and as in ſome things to Reſtrain, ſo in others to Indulge the ſenſual Appetite: For by this Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, that ſottiſh People with whom he had to do, were content to part with their natural Right, to gain an Unlawful Freedom, and to Admire what they were never like to Underſtand.</p>
            <p>But our new and perfect <hi>Law-giver Christ Jeſus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other deſign but the Salvation of Souls, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every way. Adorn'd for ſo noble a Purpoſe; though He made the <hi>Gate Narrow,</hi> and the <hi>Path Strait</hi>; yet He hath promiſed it ſhall be Open'd to all that Knock; and none, unleſs Wilfully, need miſtake the Way which leads to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>But then, becauſe He knew, there was no <hi>Rule</hi> ſo plain, but it might be <hi>Miſtaken</hi>; no <hi>Precept</hi> ſo clear, but it might be <hi>Perverted</hi>; no <hi>Doctrine</hi> ſo pure, but it might
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53972:10"/>
be <hi>Corrupted:</hi> Becauſe He foreſaw there would ariſe falſe Prophets, and falſe Teachers, whoſe buſineſs it would be to Seduce the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and Debauch the <hi>Credulous:</hi> Becauſe He foreſaw a perpetual Succeſſion of <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who, in all Ages, would ſet up the <hi>Dagon</hi> of their own laſcivious Fancies, in oppoſition to the <hi>Ark</hi> of His Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and be ſo audacious, as even to confront Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations with carnal Reaſoning; therefore to obviate, and prevent, the miſchiefs of ſuch <hi>grievous Wolves</hi>; before He took His Journey into his far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, out of a tender care of that <hi>Flock,</hi> which He had purchas'd with his Blood, He appointed <hi>Overſeers,</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> of his <hi>Flock</hi>; committed to them, and them only, the care of <hi>Feeding</hi> his <hi>Flock</hi>; amplified their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> with the like <hi>Authority,</hi> which he had receiv'd from his Father; promis'd to be with them unto the End of the World; and to aſſiſt them with that <hi>Spirit,</hi> which ſhould guide them into all Truth.</p>
            <p>If then the Scriptures be ſo clear, as to be underſtood even by the <hi>Multitude,</hi> then much more by the <hi>Diſciples in general:</hi> If by the Diſciples in general, much more by the <hi>College</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were His ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and of his Cabinet-counſel: If the Nations, to whom theſe Miniſters in Chief, and Plenipotentiaries for Chriſt, made known the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> were through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed for the Kingdom of Heaven; then much more both they, and their Succeſſors, upon whom they, in obedience to their Maſters Command, conferr'd the ſame Paſtoral power which they had receiv'd from Him.</p>
            <p>The Clearneſs then of Scripture cannot reaſonably be urg'd, in Prejudice of <hi>Chriſt's Miniſters</hi>; for whatſoever is from hence alledg'd, in favour of the <hi>People,</hi> the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will be ſtill greater on their ſide. Thus hath God promis'd the Aſſiſtance of his Spirit to all private
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53972:10"/>
men, who ſincerely endeavour to find out the Truth; then much leſs will He be wanting to the Governours of his Church, to whom He hath committed the care of the Souls of thoſe private men, and given power even to confer the Holy Ghoſt. Are the Scriptures clear to them, much more to thoſe, whom the Son of God hath ſignaliz'd, and ſet apart for the Lights of the World? <hi>Two Things</hi> are uſually brought to hinder this Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: <hi>Either that thoſe Promiſes of Aſſiſtance were made only to the Apoſtles; or elſe that they depend on the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Righteouſneſs of Men.</hi> Where, by the way, it may be Obſerv'd, that by the Firſt of theſe, the Claim of the People is utterly cut off; and by the Second, they have as ſmall Advantage.</p>
            <p>But they who argue this, might do well to conſider, that this Objection may ſtrike at the very <hi>Foundation of the Faith.</hi> For, if thoſe promiſes of Aſſiſtance, which Chriſt made to his Church be Hypothetical; if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the Performance of Men, then may the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation totter,</hi> the <hi>Gates of Hell prevail, Chriſtianity decay,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> it ſelf be loſt out of the World, before the End thereof, notwithſtanding all Chriſt's fair promiſes to the contrary. If they had been confin'd only to the Apoſtles, the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> had not long ſurviv'd its Author; every Martyrdom of an Apoſtle had pull'd down a Pillar of the Church, and by conſequence, the whole Fabrick muſt have fallen to the ground in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt Century of our Lord.</p>
            <p>Happy indeed had it been for Chriſtendom, that the Imperiouſneſs of ſome Modern Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had not brought an <hi>Odium,</hi> though unjuſtly, upon Epiſcopacy in general, that their too much Lording it over the Flock, had not given Advantage to the Enemies of <hi>Church-Authority,</hi> and their challenging to themſelves at leaſt an indirect Power in Temporals, had not alarm'd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53972:11"/>
the Kings of the Earth, to ſtand up, and take Counſel how they might deſtroy ſo dangerous an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> of the pretended Vicegerent of the <hi>Lords Anointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Happy had it been, if for the Support of their Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Greatneſs, they had not wreſted the Scriptures to countenance ſuch <hi>Doctrines,</hi> as have no clear and ſolid Foundation therein; and that under pretence of making the <hi>Church</hi> all Glorious within, her Governours all Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant without, they had not defac'd Her Innocent <hi>Beauty,</hi> and made Her <hi>Militant</hi> in the worſt of Sences.</p>
            <p>However, they can no way be excuſed, who think they can never be ſecure from <hi>Papal Supremacy,</hi> but by demoliſhing the <hi>Evangelical Hierarchy,</hi> and introducing a Presbyterian <hi>Parity</hi> into the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; and to avoid the Neceſſity of having an Infallible Judge, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every private prepoſſeſſed Fancy to the <hi>Perſpicuity of Scripture,</hi> whereby men are often bewildred in a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of Errors, ſeduc'd into thoſe by-paths which lead to the <hi>Pit</hi> of <hi>Deſtruction:</hi> For, notwithſtanding that Beam of Divine Light, which ſhines ſo bright in the Scriptures, it ſeems ſome men have Eyes either ſo weak, as to be dazled at the ſight of it, or elſe ſo blind with Pride or Malice, as not to perceive it: For St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, there are in the Scriptures ſome things hard to be underſtood, which unlearned and unſtable men wreſt unto their own Deſtruction: And therefore the Unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhould do well to conſult their Teachers; the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, thoſe that are found in the Faith; which brings me to my ſecond general Conſideration. <hi>That though the Scriptures be clear in themſelves, yet Private men, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning their Guides, and following their own corrupt Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, may deprave and diſtort them to their own deſtruction.</hi>

Apoſtle having paſs'd them over in a profound ſilence, it will be difficult at this diſtance of time exactly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine; yet 'tis not improbable, that either the <hi>Gnoſtick,</hi> or <hi>Cerinthian Hereticks,</hi> were here chiefly aim'd at, who upon a miſtake of ſome Predictions, became the Founders of a Temporal Dominion of Chriſt after His Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; wherein His Followers in their New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhould wallow in ſenſual Luſts and Pleaſures, ſpend the ſpace of a Thouſand Years, as in a Nuptial Feſtivity, and enjoy the all that is in the World; the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, in as ample and exquiſite a manner, as the moſt Epicurean Soul could effect or covet: A Fancy, in its firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, meerly Jewiſh; afterwards entertain'd by ſome Judaizing Chriſtians; and finally, rather rectified than abandoned by ſome of the Fathers in the Primitive times. And if thoſe ſublime Wits, who had all the Learning which either <hi>Jeruſalem, Athens,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> could boaſt, were nevertheleſs miſtaken in their Expoſitions of ſome abſtruſe Texts of Scripture [whilſt they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd their Opinions but as private Doctors] what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the unlearned and unſtable wreſt them to their own Deſtruction?</p>
            <p>That they have, <hi>de facto,</hi> done this, is manifeſt, ſince 'twill be hard to inſtance in any one <hi>Century,</hi> which is not either chargeable with new Hereſies, or the reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and improving of old. And the moſt extravagant Opinions, which ever yet ſaw the light, have ſtill ſhrouded themſelves under the <hi>Patronage of Holy Writ.</hi> What ſhall we ſay then, ſhall we condemn the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of Sin? Shall we ſay, That the Scriptures are of themſelves either productive of Error, or not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Store-houſe of Truth? God forbid.

The Wiſdom of this World is given in by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as the prime Cauſe of Hereſie; None were greater Tormentors of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures than the Philoſophers; for which Reaſon they are branded by the ſame Author with the Title of Arch-Hereticks: Particularly the <hi>Valentinian Hereſie,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the portentous production of the Gods, comes from the <hi>Platoniſts; Marcion's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconcern'd, and Lazy God,</hi> was firſt ſet up by the <hi>Stoicks</hi>; the Mortality of the Soul was the Doctrine of the <hi>Epicureans</hi>; the Impoſſibility of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Fleſh, of the whole ſtream of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle tells us, Not many Mighty, not many Wiſe, not many Noble, were choſen: cautions his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes againſt Philoſophy and vain Deceit, and concludes the Wiſdom of this World, Fooliſhneſs with God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Unlearned, in this place, we are not to underſtand <hi>Ideots,</hi> and thoſe who never knew Letters; but we muſt underſtand thoſe who will not be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Maſters of Divine Wiſdom,</hi> the <hi>Nolentes diſcere,</hi> thoſe who refuſe to hear the <hi>Church of the Living God, which alone is the Pillar and Foundation of Truth.</hi> And ſo their Learning, like <hi>Julian</hi>'s, only qualifies them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the Doctrines of a Crucified God, and by their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom they become the more formidable Enemies of Chriſt's Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thus, if <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the Son of the Morning, fall from his Allegiance, whole <hi>Legions</hi> of the Heavenly Hoſt are involv'd in the Rebellion. That Hereſie ſpreads like the Contagion of a Leproſie, which hath an <hi>Arrius</hi> for its Founder, and a <hi>Conſtantius</hi> for its Promoter: And the

               <hi>Mahumetan</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion owes as well its monſtrous Birth, as its fatal Increaſe to the Malice and Cunning of an <hi>Apoſtate Jew,</hi> and a <hi>Renegado Chriſtian.</hi> And to give but one inſtance more, but of a far more Modern Date, and therefore of more dangerous conſequence; That unhappy man <hi>Socinus,</hi> a perſon otherwiſe of ſingular Wit and Learning; but being in this ſenſe unlearned, <hi>i. e.</hi> having entertain'd ſo ſlender a Notion of the Church, as to date a general Defection from the very Deaths of the Apoſtles; upon this Perſwaſion, thought it not <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery</hi> to make himſelf equal to the moſt <hi>Oecumenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> to contradict the moſt receiv'd <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Church; and from this contempt of his Mother, to proceed to that daring pitch of impiety, as to deny even the Lord that bought him: ſo dangerous is it for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men to rely ſolely upon the perſpicuity of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or to meaſure the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Incarnation of the Godhead, his Conſubſtantiality with the Father, by the ſcantling of Humane Reaſon. <hi>Cedat curioſitas fidei, gloria ſaluti,</hi> was the Advice of as great a Wit as any Age hath bred. Our Curioſity muſt give place to our Faith; the thirſt of Temporal Glory, to the benefits of Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, by our Reaſon, we are firſt diſpos'd to be Chriſtians; for no Creature, beneath the Rational, is capable of Divine Revelation; but when once we have given up our Names to Chriſt, 'tis by our Faith we are ſaved: but if we aſſent to no Doctrines, but ſuch as our Reaſon fully comprehends, this is no longer Faith, but Science; and ſo we may continue Infidels, whilſt we go under the Notion of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And ſince we live in ſuch a knowing Age, wherein all <hi>captivating the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> though it be to the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> is made the ſubject of Grievance and Complaint: And that we have to deal with men of ſuch
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53972:13"/>
a ſceptical Genius, as that they do not only inquire into the Grounds and Reaſons of our Faith, but moreover deny our very <hi>Creed</hi>; with whom a <hi>Treatiſe of Humane Reaſon</hi> is of more Force, than the <hi>Revelation of St. John the Divine.</hi> To the Conſideration of theſe Men I offer <hi>Two Things,</hi> which I judge moſt proper.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, The Anſwer which <hi>Origen</hi> made to <hi>Celſus</hi>; when 'twas objected by that <hi>Calumniator</hi> againſt the Chriſtians, that their Religion was built on a very ſandy Foundation, which durſt not undergo the Teſt of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but commanded its Converts not to Examine, but Believe, and their Faith ſhould Save them. In part he owns the Objection, but wiſely retorts it upon his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, by telling him, that the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> were the greateſt <hi>Dictators</hi> in the World: Witneſs the <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that their Syſtems contain'd ſome ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret <hi>Dogmata,</hi> which their Diſciples ſwallowed ſolely upon the Credit of their Maſters. And if the Maſters of the Wiſdom of this World [which is either <hi>Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or at beſt, but <hi>Science, falſly ſo called</hi>] required ſo great ſubmiſſion from their Scholars, how much greater is to be given to thoſe Doctrines which are contain'd in the Writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, who were <hi>Taught of God, and ſpake as they were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, I urge the Authority of my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> whoſe, if any, methinks ſhould be admitted by theſe <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſi in Religion</hi>; The Divine Prerogative, ſaith he, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf to the whole Man; and requires not only <hi>Obedience</hi> from our Wills, but <hi>Submiſſion</hi> from our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings. And therefore, as we are bound to obey the Divine Law, though our Wills reluct never ſo much againſt it; ſo are we obliged to believe whatſoever God hath reveal'd, though never ſo improbable to our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings: For if we believe no more than what we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53972:13"/>
can demonſtrate to be true, we do not believe the <hi>Truth</hi> deliver'd for the <hi>Authors</hi> ſake, but the <hi>Author</hi> for the <hi>Truths</hi> ſake; and ſo we pay no more Reſpect to the Oracles of God, than we do to the Writings of Men, though never ſo much ſuſpected by us. The Faith which juſtified <hi>Abraham,</hi> was converſant in a matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to Reaſon: And therefore the higher the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Religion</hi> are above our Reaſon, the greater is the exerciſe and triumph of our Faith, and the Honour done unto God in Believing. To conclude this Point, Great is the uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> both as to the manner of interpreting the Scriptures, and the deducing true Conſequences, and wholeſom Concluſions from thence; and if it be wholly ſuppreſs'd, our Religion will degenerate into Superſtition; we ſhall be ſo far from paying God a <hi>Reaſonable Service,</hi> that we ſhall offer Him the <hi>Sacrifice of Fools.</hi> But then it muſt be kept to a due temper: for, if it be not managed by prudent <hi>Guides,</hi> 'tis apt to grow wild and extravagant, to hurry us on to a Belief of the <hi>Fouleſt Impoſtures,</hi> to a Practice of the <hi>Groſſeſt Impieties,</hi> which either the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of the World, the domineering Enmity of the Fleſh, or the implacable Malice of Satan, can propound to be believed or practis'd.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſecond Reaſon of private Mens falling into Error, is their <hi>Inſtability</hi> in not adhering to their Guides; but forſaking them to go aſtray in the intricate paths of Error and Deceit. Hereſie being nothing elſe but an Exciſion from, and Diſobedience to the Church in points of <hi>Faith.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle pronounceth an Heretick <hi>Self-condemned</hi>; one who hath want only cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to himſelf thoſe Opinions, for an obſtinate Defence whereof, after full and plain means of Conviction, he juſtly falls under the Cenſures of the Church, is Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the Aſſembly of the Saints; and ſo without
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53972:14"/>
               <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> continues in a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate, if that of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicans</hi> be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd ſuch.</p>
            <p>Not in vain then are thoſe frequent <hi>Cautions</hi> againſt Falling away, thoſe repeated <hi>Admonitions</hi> to Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, thoſe earneſt <hi>Exhortations</hi> to hold faſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and contend for the Faith which was once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd; thoſe ſo much inculcated <hi>Commands</hi> of obeying thoſe who are ſet Over us in the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them which have the Rule over you, who have ſpoken unto you the Word of God, whoſe Faith follow.</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your Souls.</hi> For in vain may thoſe men commit themſelves to the immediate Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God, who neglect to hear his <hi>Guides</hi>; and violate His Commandments, in hopes to procure His help and favour: For, from that very moment of time, they ceaſe to be Members of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> they are become <hi>Out-lawries</hi> in a <hi>Goſpel-ſenſe,</hi> they have loſt the <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly King,</hi> and they lay under the <hi>Deprivation</hi> of the Benefits belonging to the Subjects of that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above.</p>
            <p>And what wonder, if being in this forlorn condition the Tempter take his advantage, lead them into the Wilderneſs, and there preſent to their diſturb'd Fancies falſe Schemes of Religion, ſuggeſt unworthy apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God; and whatſoever is by him thus ſuggeſted, is by them miſtaken for new Light and holy Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this Spirit of Deluſion dares put forth, among Chriſtians, no Doctrines but ſuch as pretend to be founded on the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> to this purpoſe they are <hi>wreſted and tortur'd,</hi> their <hi>Scope</hi> is miſtaken, their <hi>Senſe</hi> abuſed, their <hi>Periods</hi> miſerably mangled, their whole <hi>Deſign</hi> perverted to countenance every <hi>Wild Opinion,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:53972:14"/>
which either a <hi>capricious Fancy can imagine,</hi> or a <hi>malicious Wit invent.</hi> And from hence it comes to paſs, that we have as many ſeveral ſorts of Chriſtians as there are different Humors or Intereſts of men; and the Goſpel with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though in a quite contrary ſenſe, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all things unto all men.</p>
            <p>And having made thus bold with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> it cannot be expected that they ſhould deal more modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with any Authority inferiour to that; the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Traditions muſt now give place to new Diſcoveries. The Conſent of the Catholick Apoſtolick Church be born down by the <hi>Dictates</hi> of a private, I might ſay, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Spirit. Whereas there is all the reaſon in the World to believe that the Apoſtles beſt knew the mind of their Maſter, that they faithfully and fully communicated their knowledge to their Succeſſors, and ſo by certain ſteps and degrees we may arrive at this fundamental Truth: <hi>That as the Church is the moſt faithful Keeper,</hi> ſo the moſt <hi>authentick Expoſitor of Scripture.</hi> Which fairly uſhers in my third and laſt Conſideration. <hi>That for the preventing Miſtakes from riſing, and ſuppreſſing Errors when riſen, 'Tis the duty of Private Men to ſubmit their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in matters of Religion, to the Determinations of thoſe whom God hath Conſtituted to be their Spiritual Guides and Governours; unleſs it manifeſtly appear, That ſuch Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are contrary to Gods Word.</hi> And this I ſhall aſſert very briefly both from the Qualifications of the Perſons who are appointed to Rule in the Church, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the thing.</p>
            <p n="1">I. And that which firſt entitles the <hi>Governours</hi> of the Church to a <hi>Superiority</hi> over their <hi>Subjects,</hi> is that ſpecial <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> which they have receiv'd from Chriſt, to inſtruct the World in all neceſſary Truths, and that Charge which he hath laid upon others to obey them. If any one liſteth to ſee their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53972:15"/>
may find it recorded in any of the four Evangeliſts. I ſhall exhibit it, as 'tis exemplified <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>And Jeſus came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All power is given to me in Heaven and Earth: Go ye therefore, and Teach all Nations, Teaching them to obſerve all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have Commanded you: And lo, I am with You al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unto the end of the World.</hi> In which words there are theſe Three Things conſiderable: 1. That Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd His Diſciples immediately after He had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd Himſelf Omnipotent. 2. That this Commiſſion implies it to be Chriſt's Will, that all Nations of the World ſhould obey them. 3. That He promiſed to be with Them and their Succeſſors, unto the end of the World. And there cannot be a fuller inſtance, of the Perverſneſs of ſome Men, who, to evacuate and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Authority of the preſent Church, will needs confine <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to ſome period of time, ſhort of the final <hi>diſſolution</hi> of all things, when time ſhall be ſwallow'd up of <hi>Eternity</hi>; if not contrary to the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſenſe of the Word, yet at leaſt to the deſign of the Promiſe, and the nature of the Thing.</p>
            <p>Which of the Ambaſſadours of earthly Potentates ever received ſo ample a Commiſſion? the Perſon commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was Omnipotent. The Commiſſion was univerſal in reſpect of Perſons, Time and Place; 'twas directed to all the Nations, and to continue throughout all the Ages of the World, and for the Execution of it they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powr'd from above; whereſoever they came, they conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a Spiritual Government, and they had full Power to Enact ſuch Laws as they thought tended to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of their <hi>Maſters Kingdom</hi>; and they did with <hi>Authority,</hi> and not by way of Counſel only, as ſome would have, determine ſuch Controverſies as aroſe, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All along their Spiritual progreſs, if any City refus'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53972:15"/>
to receive Them, or their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> they ſhook off the duſt off their Feet againſt it, as a direful Preſage of ſome enſuing Judgment, as the next words manifeſtly declare; <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, It ſhall be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrha <hi>in the day of Judgment, than for that City.</hi> Wretched City! how has thy Diſobedience aſcertain'd, and aggrandiz'd thy Ruine. The lewd Inhabitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> ſhall find more Favour in the day of Judgment, than thy Citizens. Moſt true it is, their Power was purely Spiritual: Chriſt, the Prince of Peace, did not commiſſion Generals to deſtroy, but ſent forth Apoſtles to convert the Nations, by declaring His Laws, and denouncing His Judgments. But then they had no coercive Power of the Sword, which God hath given to Magiſtrates, to inflict the Judgments which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd. But as they, becauſe living under Heathen Powers, left the Event of their Spiritual <hi>Cenſures</hi> ſolely to the Divine Vengeance, [which they who eſcap'd in this World, were ſure to meet with in the next]; ſo is it ſtill, unleſs <hi>Kings</hi> are graciouſly pleaſed to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Nurſing Fathers to the Church,</hi> to enforce Spiritual Cenſures by Corporal Penalties, and adjudge thoſe Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the Protection of the Laws of the Realm, who are juſtly depriv'd of the Benefits of the Church. By all which it appears, that the Church is ſomething elſe, than a <hi>Chriſtian Commonwealth,</hi> ſince there was a Church before the Commonwealth became Chriſtian; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> nor any of his Diſciples, hath yet been able to ſhew, how, or when the Church forfeited Her antecedent Right: And that though the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thereof may challenge to themſelves a Power di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, yet no ways oppoſite to the Civil; The <hi>Shield of Faith</hi> doth not claſh with the <hi>Sword of Juſtice.</hi> And maugre the deſigns of thoſe, who have Evil will at <hi>Sion,</hi> this is not to erect <hi>Imperium in imperio,</hi> much leſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53972:16"/>
to ſet the <hi>Mitre</hi> above the <hi>Crown:</hi> Since whatſoever Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is here challenged as of Divine Right, is purely Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, exercis'd to Spiritual ends and purpoſes; ſo far from interfering with the <hi>Civil,</hi> from Abſolving men from that Obedience, which is indiſpenſably due thereunto; that whereſoever it takes place, it abates nothing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right which the Magiſtrate had in the Affairs of Religion: Yet herein it will appear, that the Wiſdom of the deſpiſed King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> did far ſurmount all the Policies of the World; in that he hath ſo interwoven the Concerns of His <hi>Church</hi> with the Intereſt of the <hi>State,</hi> that at the ſame time any man ſhall dare to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an <hi>Enemy to his Kingdom,</hi> he muſt ceaſe to be a <hi>Friend to Caeſars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The reaſonableneſs of this Submiſſion will appear from thoſe promiſes of Aſſiſtance, which Chriſt hath made to them, but not to others without them; much leſs to others againſt them: And thoſe are <hi>Illumination, Direction</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> Illumination, in things Obſcure; Direction, in things Difficult; Power, to encounter, and overcome all Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>And this may be one Reaſon, why <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not Arm his Diſciples with a Temporal Sword; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly He, who had all Power given Him in Heaven, and on Earth, might have done it, if He had pleas'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He furniſh'd them with ſuch <hi>Extraordinary Virtues,</hi> as did abundantly ſupply the defect of that. Thus they who could raiſe the <hi>Dead</hi> from the <hi>Grave,</hi> needed no other Argument to gain the <hi>Living.</hi> They who could convince the Conſciences, captivate the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, beat down the Imaginations, and conquer the Affections of their Adverſaries, needed no Sword, nor Spear, nor any of the Bloody Engines of War, to make themſelves Maſters of the Field.</p>
            <p>Now the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> though not in the ſame <hi>Meaſure,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:53972:16"/>
doth ſtill reſide in the Governors of the <hi>Church:</hi> though they do not equalize the Apoſtles in working of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, diverſities of Languages, extent of Juriſdiction; though they have not, as they had, the whole World for their Dioceſs; yet are they ſtill <hi>Biſhops of Souls; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and Doctors for the Conſummation of the Saints, for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, unto a perfect man in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Either then let Private men ſubmit to their Spiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; exerciſing their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> according to God's Word; or elſe let them warrant their Diſſent with greater, at leaſt equal Atteſtations of the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and then there will be no great fear of any danger ariſing from Diſſenting Brethren.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The reaſonableneſs of this Submiſſion will appear from their Study and Learning in Divine Matters, and from the far leſs Knowledge and ordinary Capacity in others. The Apoſtles, they had their Knowledge of Divine things, either from a conſtant and familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with their Maſter, or elſe from that plentiful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, which He vouchſafed them immediately upon His Reſtauration to His Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That which was thus wonderfully beſtowed upon them, their Succeſſors are forc'd to acquire, by <hi>hard Study, great Induſtry, frequent</hi> and <hi>fervent Addreſs</hi> to the <hi>Fountain of Wiſdom.</hi> For, not only the <hi>Knowledge of Languages,</hi> a <hi>Calmneſs of Mind,</hi> neither ruffled with the ſtorms of Paſſion, nor diſtracted with the Cares of the World; but likewiſe a <hi>piercing Judgment,</hi> to diſtinguiſh between the Literal and Figurative ſenſe, to weigh the ſcope and coherence of things, to compare one place with another, to illuſtrate obſcure Texts, by thoſe which are more plain, to conſult, and find out the ſenſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, is required to a right underſtanding of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53972:17"/>
For they do not only contain things of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hard to be underſtood; but moreover, thoſe very things are rendred more difficult, by the <hi>Malice of Satan,</hi> and the <hi>Cunning of his Agents.</hi> The Enemy hath ſown ſuch a prodigious quantity of <hi>Tares,</hi> that 'tis very hard ſometimes to find out the <hi>Wheat:</hi> What wonder then, if ſuch a ſpawn of Monſtrous Opinions flow from the Scriptures falling either into prophane hands, or being interpreted by a private, ſelf-conceited, and unruly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? If St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was caught up into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and was even oppreſs'd with <hi>Revelations</hi>; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs cryes out, as well for the <hi>Difficulty,</hi> as the <hi>Dignity</hi> of his <hi>Function,</hi> Who is ſufficient for theſe things? Then certainly it can be no Diſparagement to the <hi>Laity,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever quick-ſighted they may be in other Affairs, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them not ſuch competent Judges here, as thoſe of the Clergy are. And indeed, we hear of very few, though never ſuch Deſpiſers of the dull Clergy in their life-time, but are very willing to admit of their advice and aſſiſtance when they come to <hi>Dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly and laſtly, The neceſſity of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion appears, as 'tis the only means to reſtore Peace and Unity to the Church; Happineſs and Tranquillity to the State, how ineffectual the ſeveral Projects of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, Toleration,</hi> unwarrantable <hi>Compliance</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to effect the <hi>Work of Coalition:</hi> I mean to Compoſe thoſe <hi>Differences,</hi> and Unite thoſe <hi>Diviſions</hi> which ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly <hi>Rage</hi> among us; we either are, or 'tis to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſad Experience, may be Taught.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Projects</hi> can only lay claim to an imaginary Happineſs, and however plauſible they may ſeem in the Notion, yet may they prove dangerous in the Practice, at leaſt, not attain the ends for which they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd. For, in truth, as well may we expect <hi>To gather Grapes from Thorns,</hi> or <hi>Figs from Thiſtles,</hi> as that a <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:53972:17"/>
of Diſagreements, ſhould produce the bleſſed Fruits of Peace and Concord. Theſe are Contraries, and deſtroy each other.</p>
            <p>Now, what other <hi>Expedient</hi> have we left but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring, and Aſſerting the <hi>Diſcipline of the Church.:</hi> That ſo they, who will neither <hi>Hold the Faith, nor keep a good Conſcience, by being deliver'd up to Satan, may learn, at leaſt, not to blaſpheme.</hi> Many and grievous are the Guilts, which are charg'd upon the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; yet ſuch is the <hi>Exactneſs</hi> of Her <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and the <hi>Obedience</hi> of <hi>Her Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters,</hi> conſequent upon it, as hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto preſerv'd Her from Ruine. Now, if our Fears of the Increaſe of <hi>Popery,</hi> be as real, as they are pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, methinks it ſhould be no ill Policy to learn Wiſdom from our Adverſaries; for that which preſerves a <hi>Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted Church</hi> from Falling, in all likelihood will make a <hi>Pure One</hi> to Flouriſh.</p>
            <p>However, we are little the better for being deliver'd from the <hi>Slaveries</hi> of an Implicit Faith, and Foreign <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,</hi> if we run into <hi>Licentiouſneſs, Infidelity,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> at Home. For, who is ſo blind as not to ſee that Irreverence and Diſreſpect for the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Clergy,</hi> hath been accompanied with a manifeſt <hi>Decay of Piety,</hi> and a notorious Contempt of the moſt Eſſential Parts of <hi>Religion?</hi> That want of Submiſſion, to the Juſt and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly <hi>Determinations of the Church,</hi> no leſs Juſtly and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ratified and eſtabliſhed by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> hath given Birth to ſuch monſtrous Variety of Opinions, as hath ſcarce left any Fundamental of the Faith unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd, if not denied; <hi>Atheiſm</hi> creeping in by inſenſible degrees, from indulging too great a Latitude in Matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>And now in the Cloſe of All, Let every Man ſeriouſly conſider with himſelf the <hi>Hainouſneſs and Danger of Schiſm</hi>; and the <hi>bleſſed Effects</hi> of <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53972:18"/>The Danger of Schiſm, in that it breaks, the precious <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church,</hi> alienates the Affections of the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> thereof. Who, as they have but one <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo they ſhould have but one <hi>Soul.</hi> And ſo inſtead of <hi>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Forbearance, Meekneſs, Temperance,</hi> thoſe lovely Fruits of the Spirit, which adorn private Men, and ſecure the publick Peace, there ariſe <hi>Hatred, Variance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Evil Surmiſing, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Hereſies, Murders</hi>; thoſe ugly Works of the Fleſh, which diſſolve the Bonds of Society, and exclude Men from the Kingdom of God. How that the <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> is arreſted with Fears and Jealouſies from without, when he conſiders his Sin of Diſobedience againſt thoſe whom the Lord hath ſet over him, and the <hi>Dreadfulneſs</hi> of the Churches Cenſures, when juſtly incurr'd for his Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. How that he is tormented with ſad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Reflections from within; being <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable in all his Ways, ever learning, but never coming to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth</hi>; but being abandon'd to the <hi>Deluſions</hi> of a <hi>Private Spirit,</hi> he is miſerably toſs'd to and fro with every Wind of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> till at length he makes an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of the <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, the bleſſed Effects of <hi>Obedience</hi>; how the Humble Chriſtian, by an happy Reſignation of his Judgment, there where our Lord ſeems to demand it, enjoys a perpetual Peace, and Freedom from Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, together with all his Fellow-Members of the ſame <hi>Myſtical Body.</hi> As for thoſe great <hi>Myſteries of Godlineſs,</hi> which concern his Salvation, though they are above his Reaſon, yet not above his Faith; and he had rather rely on the Churches Deciſions of them, when he finds no place of Scripture plainly contrary to ſuch Deciſions, than either give way to his own <hi>Curioſity,</hi> or heed to the <hi>Diſputers</hi> of this <hi>World,</hi> left he ſhould thereby <hi>wreſt them to his own Deſtruction.</hi> And this he thinks he may do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53972:18"/>
with leſs trouble to himſelf, and greater aſſurance of the Truth, and ſo he continues ſound in the Faith, without being skill'd in thoſe unhappy Controverſies, in which the <hi>Diſputers</hi> of this World have involv'd it.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Harmony</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> is always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an entire League, and Union of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, [that common Badge by which Chriſtians were once diſtinguiſh'd from the reſt of the World] and a Bleſſed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> of God's Publick Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whereby the Members of the <hi>Church Militant,</hi> in ſome ſort, reſemble the <hi>Saints</hi> of the <hi>Church Triumphant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Word, in this Obedience, the Humble Chriſtian goes on ſecurely, and chearfully, in the <hi>Ways of God's Commandments</hi>; And inſtead of troubling his Head with the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of Religion, practiſeth thoſe plain, but moſt important Duties of <hi>Godlineſs, Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Sobriety</hi>; which will render his Life happy here, and crown him with Eternal <hi>Felicity</hi> hereafter.</p>
