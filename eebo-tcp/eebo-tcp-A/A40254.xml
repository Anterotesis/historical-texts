            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SOME QUERIES To all the Teachers and Profeſſors of Chriſtianity TO ANSWER.</head>
            <p>
               <label>QUERY I.</label>
WHere did ever the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the primitive times ſet up Dancing-Schools and Fencing-Schools, and ſend their Youth to learn to Dance and Fence, as thoſe called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have done ſince the primitive Times; let us ſee where ſuch things were practiſed in the Scriptures by the True <hi>Chriſtians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>QUERY II.</label>
Where was any Inſtruments of Muſick allowed of God to be invented and uſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> to themſelves, but unto the Lord? Indeed <hi>David</hi> uſed them as unto the Lord, and Danced before the Ark of the Lord? But what's the Uſe and End of all the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Dancing in <hi>Chriſtendom?</hi> Was not the Melody the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> made in their Hearts to the Lord?</p>
            <p>
               <label>QUERY III.</label>
Where did the primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> invent Playes and Shews, as thoſe called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have done ſince the Apoſtles dayes?</p>
            <p>
               <label>QUERY IV.</label>
Whether any of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Old Teſtament ever invented Playes and Shews to get Money by them, as thoſe called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do now? We deſire you will produce your Rule and Example out of the Old or New Teſtament, among <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for theſe things?</p>
            <p>
               <label>QUERY V.</label>
Where did the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Apoſtles dayes ſet up or uſe Bear-Baitings, Bull-Baitings, Cock-Fightings, Nine-pins and Bowls, and Cards and Dice, and ſuch like Sports and Games, as thoſe called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do now, to make themſelves Merry withal, and to ſpend their Pretious Time away, and call it <hi>Paſtime,</hi> and Rejoyce, and ſtir up Wantonneſs in People? Shew Scripture for theſe things, ſeeing you profeſs it your Rule? Are not thoſe that live Wantonly upon Earth, and in Pleaſure, dead while they live? Are not thoſe that Rejoyce to Rejoyce in the Lord?</p>
            <p>
               <label>QUERY VI.</label>
Where did the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Apoſtles dayes make and uſe Matches at Foot-Ball, and Wreſtling, and appoint Horſe-Races, and Hunting for Pleaſure, and ſuch like, and ſo glory in their own Strength, and abuſe the Creatures? Are not theſe things contrary to the Practice of the Holy Men, who rejoyced and gloried in the Lord? Shew us your Rule in the Holy Scriptures for theſe things?</p>
            <p>
               <label>QUERY VII.</label>
Whether all theſe Playes, Games, Shews, Sports, and other vain Exercises, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> do not Spoil and Corrupt Youth and Men, and Ruin them in Perſon and Eſtate?</p>
            <p>And doth not <hi>Amos</hi> ſay, <hi>Wo to ſuch that chant to the Sound of the Vial, and invent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Inſtruments of Muſick, like</hi> David? <bibl>
                  <hi>Amos</hi> 6.</bibl>
