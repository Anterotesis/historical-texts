            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of civill errours is, that we speake more to the affections then to the Iudgement, and therefore offer passion in stead of reason, or make one but the counterfeit of the other, or else not affecting one anothers persons, we fling headily into opposite paths or principles, in which not treading together at first, we cannot possibly meet together at last, and in this aberration we loose both truth and our selves.</hi>

            <p>The first Argument of the first Demurrer is formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the incapacity of the persons governing,<note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> and it runs thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob. That which is now termed a Parliament, is neither formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, materially, nor effectually a Parliament, such as is requisite for this Kingdom, either according to the mind of God, or the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the State. First, because the change which is made in it, is not made by those who first constituted it, unlesse it be by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. The modern modell containes not the whole, nor the major part of the peoplee Secondly, the alteration is made by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons only, the Nobility as</hi> illustrior pars populi, <hi>appeared not in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Though this Argument (with the rest) relates more to the Commanders then to the obeyers,<note place="margin">The end of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevient to the end of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> (of whom our controversie onely is) and that we of the People have a right to do lawfull things, though there were no Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate lawfull or unlawful to oversee us, yet I shall not stop at these advantages, but oppose to the main of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the main of our Creation and conservation. For we have nothing else to doe in the world, but to praise God and love our neighbour. The circumstance of the Magistrate is onely to be an encouragement of this, and to see that it be done with security: and if he doe this (whatever he be) we are beholding to him, and should praise God for him, and then why not obey him?</p>
            <p>Though this were granted, That one Magistrate was unjustly ejected by another, and one government by another, yet that relates onely to those who co-operated in it whilst it was doing. How can such a supposed guilt in them, be in any part continued upon, and ascribed to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49850:4"/>
us of the low ranke of the people? or now especially that we come into it after it is done, and after we are under the full possession of a present Power? People by the effects of it, sustaine punishment enough if they lose a good Magistracy, must they likewise be punisht because it is lost, though they were no con-cause of it?</p>
            <p>The Authour of the Grand Case of Conscience, p. 10. infers <hi>Yes,</hi> and therefore makes our new commotions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: <hi>because we can do nothing just in a State, where, (through the defect of a legal Magistracy) we can have no justice, yea though the things we do be in themselves just. For (quoth he) judgement is then onely just, when it is exercised by the higher Powers, the legall Magistracy of that Kingdome, where it is acted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, things are considerable, onely so far as they may reach the ends for which they are.<note place="margin">All justice or just things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late not essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Magistrate.</note> The end of every Magistrate is to see justice executed in case it be violated: <hi>Iusto enim non ponitur lex.</hi> The end of justice is to be a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>equity,</hi> that is, of <hi>equality.</hi> Justice or the proportion of equality is either comutative or distributive. But neither of these relate so essentially to the legall Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that nothing may be done truly and conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously just, without he co-operate in it. As for <hi>commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive equality,</hi> if <hi>Titius</hi> lend <hi>Sempronius</hi> ten bushels of such a quantity, which bushels have the publique mark upon them, and <hi>Sempronius</hi> pay him ten other every way of the same equality,<note place="margin">Of commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive justice Vid. p. 26.35.</note> but that there wants the former mark, or that the said bushels have another mark, will you say <hi>Sempronius</hi> hath not intrinsically done <hi>Titius</hi> justice, or hath not justly satisfied him in his quantity? especially if in the mean time no more of that former marke can be had? As for <hi>distributive justice,</hi> we know that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to avoyd the Iegall Magistracy and the judgement of the higher powers of that Countrey,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. of distributive justice.</note> and rather to end things by arbitrement among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which had been an advice unjust, and to the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of Christianity, if things in themselves just might not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49850:4"/>
be done but by the justice of the legall Magistrate. This therefore is but according to an old Axiome of justice, <hi>Provisio hominis tollit provisionem legis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much I have thought fit to answer in generall to this objection;<note place="margin">This present Parliament is effectually a Parliament.</note> but now more particularly I answer to its terms. And first, why is not this effectually a Parliament, seeing it is the Supream present power of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no part excluded?<note place="margin">Vid p. 18.</note> which in this controversie is the very term of the question. I hope he means no Criticisme by the word Parliament; if he doth, it signifies onely a publique speaking or consulting together for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. Moreover, the Authour would be (I am sure) much perplext, if I should aske him, <hi>how he knoweth so indubitably that this is not a Parliament or supreame Power requisite for this Kingdome, according to the mind of God?</hi> He must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us if we thinke formes no more then persons are to last here alwaies; or that the changes which have been, and still are to be of both, must never be done but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the customary formalities of a quiet people, but rather according to the extreame necessity of a State. For if he aske me, what it is that forms in-organizd peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into a Government,<note place="margin">Necessity above formes of, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> of what sort soever? I answer, Necessity. If, what makes or takes away a Law in a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment established? I answer, Necessity. If, what takes away a Government it selfe? I answer, according to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. <hi>page</hi> 2. that which first gave it being, <hi>viz.</hi> Necessity. Of which there are severall degrees; for in a peaceable State a word may take away that which in a disturbd State must be taken away by the Sword: after which it is but equall that he who gives the last blow, should in that quarrell give the last word, and leave us to a peremptory obedience, unlesse we would have no quarter in the world, or be like the old <hi>servati in bello,</hi> who were sold, confind to chains all their lives, or condemnd to dig perpetually in Mynes; All which it seems this Authour would have the conclusion of this argument, or else we are more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to the charity of enemies, then to his. If we will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49850:5"/>
not be perswaded by the States arguments, yet let us hear what <hi>Grotius,</hi> among others, determined long agoe, for all the world in this case. <hi>If a King have but part of a supream power (which consists in making and taking away Lawes, in laying universall Taxes) and the People or Senate have the other, the King may be forcibly opposed if he invade that part which is not his, because for so much he hath no right nor power. This is to hold, although such a King have the Militia alone; for that (in his hand) relates onely to forraigne warre, it being uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable how they who share in supreame.

have for their Right of invading one another by the way of war: a circumstance no more necessary betwixt them, then that in the marriage of two persons, a Lawyer should come after the Minister hath conjoyn'd them, and tell them in what cases they may again proceed to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, and after their Divorce, what kinde of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages they should make next.

            </p>
            <p>This is by them affirmed, and the state of Venice as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Platonists deny the other; for otherwise Noble men would be as difficulty reformed as Kings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they rarely conferre illustrious Titles of Nobility on any but those who are in illustrious Offices, things separable from persons, by which meanes all Offices with them are questionable: But to return, that which according to themselves thus excluded the King, by the same Logicke excluded the Lords; and if they either directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly concurred to the ruine of the rest of the Kingdome, then the argument runs strong, that the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mons were bound to preserve it, and that the rest rightly owe their whole protection under God to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But because I will suppose nothing here, the argument of matter of fact must judge one as well as the other.</p>

As for the exclusion of some Members of the house of Commons,<note place="margin">Of Secluded Members.</note> I hope the sincere Presbyterians wonder not at that act, because the Kirk and State of Scotland was preserved by such an act last year, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courrence of the same meanes which did this here.

In this case the difference was as it were legall betwixt the Members, but not to be decided any way but by force, there being no other Tribunall to judge them, and their house might not judge of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there they were parties and judges, a thing allowed no where;<note place="margin">Whither the transactions of the legall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the house be invaled, when any mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers are forct away?</note> and if otherwise, then the major part might legally vote the other out of the house at pleasure. But what was at last determined by any number above forty with the speaker in the legal place, seemes not out of form to us of the people; which was the case of the House of Lords when most of them &amp; many of the Commons at the beginning of the first War, fled to the King under pretence of force from <hi>Westm.</hi> Yea when the five members were forc't from sitting, yet the rest of the House sat and acted without them, and voted a Committee, <hi>Ian.</hi> 5.

               </note>I wish he had taken the paines to give either a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or an instance in his Axiome, or have drawn up his inference into a Syllogisme; for I feare we shall finde wide impertinence in the first, and a grosse <hi>non sequitur,</hi> in the last as he hath ordered it. <hi>The question disputed here is not whither the denominated Parliament now sitting at Westminster be a Parliament according to the old forme and composure of Parliament or no, but whither tht Parliament now sitting at Westminster, be the supreame power of the Kingdome or no, and to be obeyed in lawfull things. His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument runs thus;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The surpeme power of the Kingdome consists in a Parliament of King, Lords and Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But at Westminster there is not a Parliament consisting of King, Lords and Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo</hi> at Westminster, there is no true Parliament at all <hi>nam dum cessat forma, cessat formatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought he had been so good a Logician, as to have understood that the conclusion of his Syllogisme ought to have been contradictory to the question, from which it is as distant as if he would have concluded that two and three make five, which is very true, but how is it any thing to the purpose?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Whither the present power be the suprem?</note>However I will doe him the favour to deny his Major—For we speake of powers which <hi>now</hi> are, and he himselfe hath all along condoled the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aps the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word <hi>Parliament</hi> poses him, or else he would thereby
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49850:8"/>
impose on others.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olute, as he observed other Kings were; whereas by our constitution he was but one of three, who concurred to the making and abrogating a Law, and it belong'd to the Commons alone, to lay an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall taxe; so that he was in most things rather Prince by office, then King by power, <hi>in tanto, non in toto.</hi> Even so the word <hi>Parliament,</hi> as it hath been popularly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, signifies the assembly of severall houses, deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and concluding what was judged for the good of the publique.</p>
            <p>But it is a contradiction to say a Parliament cannot at all be truly so called, unles so understood; we know there are eight Parliaments in <hi>France,</hi> which are not of such a constitution, though of the same Denomination. And if severall persons plenipotentiarily deputed to conclude for the publique good of the people, sit now at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and that the other concurrent powers be civily dead; why may not we congruously enough still call them a Parliament? <hi>His</hi> axiome therefore serves onely against himselfe, and the true English of <hi>dum cessat form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>In the next place he offers a case, If the King, when hee came to accuse the five Members,</hi>

               <hi>had detained all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49850:9"/>
but forty and the Speaker; and had forc't them to Vote, that the whole Legislative power resided in himselfe; would we have deemed this a valid Vote? Especially seeing some Votes since this Session were adjudged Null, because the House was under a force. By which it seemes (quoth he) that with some new</hi> veritas non est perpetua; <hi>and</hi> Duo dum faciunt idem, non estidem.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </note>To the first I answer positively, That such a Vote at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the King, had beene no wayes duely valid.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The case of the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the house of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel.</note>But what is this to the purpose? For the question should have beene <hi>after the King had detained such a Vote, and had got us all into his full possession, whether we of the people might have obey'd him ever after in lawfull things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, if he would have the people understand this case to be parallel, to the late exclusion of the Members, he prevaricates grosly againe; For he supposes the very forty <hi>in the House,</hi> with the King, to have been under a force; whereas in the Parliaments late case, none but those <hi>who were out of the House,</hi> were under restraint; the former were supposed to be forc't to a particular Vote, the latter were kept from Voting at all: Besides they who <hi>de facto</hi> Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the House, have publiquely declared that they past their Votes, with all wonted freedome, and were rescued as it were from an overawing power, which concludes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Argument abundantly. As in this Argument he hath done truth little service; so he hath (by his mistake) done Kingly Government lesse. For if Princes who have us in their full possession, may be obey'd in no lawful things, after they acquire an addition of some other powers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull; then he would dislove most of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and have absolv'd us from Allegiance to King <hi>Charles</hi> long before this Parliament began; by which sort of arguing the Royallists I see will have no great prise this Gentleman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Parliament hath already declared the Votes made under a force are null</hi>; This Vote I suppose he meanes past,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49850:9"/>
after Boyes and apprentices of the Towne,<note place="margin">The case of the apprentices en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tring and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the house not parallel.</note> had entred the House, and made the Speaker propound, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Vote what they pleas'd. Here indeed there were forced Votes; But surely this proves not, that they who Voted, when the Members were last excluded, Voted in that manner. Besides the Parliament which knowes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then we of the people, what their owne disorders within their House are, are only fit to Vote, what Votes have beene forc't upon them, and they since that time have declared, they never transacted things with greater freedome and lesse overawing. From whence I easily see that his Axiomes will serve him nothing at all. For we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Veritatem esse perpetuam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Parl. votes against force, still observed &amp; are the same still.</note> if we speake of naturall and Mathematicall truths, where there is no <hi>medium pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionis,</hi> to varie the thing; as, all number are even or odd; because there is no middle number, so all lines are either crooked or straight: But morall &amp; civil things are alwaies in change, because humane actions are invested with such an infinity of circumstances and accidents;<note place="margin">VVhy actions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must change.</note> for which reason <hi>Duo dum faciunt idem non est idem</hi>; For no two men in the world can act the same thing in all the same cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances: Thus we heare that <hi>Omnis des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Two principall inconveniences hee findes in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Government, and by the goodnesse of the fruit hee hopes hee may judge of the Tree.</hi> where I must againe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish him, that the civill fruit of a Government is alike in all Governments, especially as to the <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> of a people besides, if the tree and the fruits here were alike, then a good Axiome were spol'd; <hi>Malus homo potest esse bonus civis, &amp; bonus magistratus,</hi> A man bad to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, may be a good Magistrate and a good Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths man. His first inconvenience is,</p>

               </note>
               <hi>That wee have now made the basis of the State, a quick-sand; and it stands like</hi> Nebuchadnezzars <hi>Image, upon a mixt footing, part iron, part clay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, that it stands not now on so mixt a footing as before; For the concurrence of King, Lords, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for the product of a supream act, was a mixture of things very heterogeneous, to enter into one and the same composition: By reason whereof, supremacy confin'd as it were on a Battable ground; and if we will believe <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents,</hi> King sometimes gain'd upon the other two, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Lords topt both, and now all is more united then ever in the sole sufferage of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Object.</note>
               <hi>Toleration is the next inconvenience, it being but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable, That if wee thinke it lawfull to force people to submit to the Orders of the State, the same people be compel'd to adhere to an established confession of faith in Religion. For it is presum'd that Obedience is fully as due to God as to man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, the Christian Religion is not tolerated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, it is enjoyn'd, as much as one man can passe it upon another;<note place="margin">Of toleration.</note> For, the finall penalty of neglecting it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49850:10"/>
here is not to be required of us mutually in this life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The confessions of faith, which he would have men forc't too, are (as I conceive he meanes) but logicall deductions out of Scripture, Ergo not indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, true enough to be by force obtruded on mens faiths; <hi>It is not enough to say here, that they who compile them verily believe them true, and intend not to deceive,</hi> which is all that can be said. For then they doe no more but quote themselves, and we are taught that it is a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish opinion to beleeve any company of men are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in what they purpose: wherefore the Magistrate can doe no more safely, then recommend not force, their notions and Logick on the people. But in a case of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> or in a morall thing he may be more perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then in a divine, because those things are certainlyer knowne to us as men, then what is of divine revelation and inference.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He feares that by an obedience to an unlawfull power,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>he may assert its unlawfulnesse; and should our servants rise against us, and command us by threats to performe a lawfull Act, which is but transient we might yeild to avoid their force: But if they should affirme that the Government of the family were theirs by right, and that they intended to perpetuate it over us; we should thinke it a great sinne to betray that place and power wherein God hath naturally and morally placed us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is a very fine subtilty to end in nothing:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </note> and I am sure what ever the basis of the State be,<note place="margin">The magistrate in a state, not as a Father of a Family.</note> the Basis of his Argument is put on a quick-sand. For if he intend truth thereby, he should have proved this maine thing; That the former Magistrate was our naturall parent, and that we all derive from him, as from a <hi>Genarcha,</hi> which being so evidently false, is as ill supposed. For in this con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fusion of Families in the world, in which the originall Families are lost; we owe no naturall duty to any, but to those from whose blood we derive.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though it were true, that the chiefe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate were our naturall Parent, yet it followes not, but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49850:11"/>
there may be a case wherein he might be refrained from Government; the law supposes many, which is sufficient to oppose this Gentlemans single judgement; And if he be indeed a Presbyterian, he hath already concluded as much in the last Kings case, by concurring to invest his person with the accidents of Warre, in detayning him prisoner at <hi>Holmby,</hi> and <hi>Newcastle</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I understand not what he meanes by <hi>Gods placing a Magistrate morally over us.</hi> For God he is our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and supreame Magistrate; our Parent is our naturall and domestik Magistrate, and those who command the State wherein we are, are our civill publique subordinate Magistrates under God; and every particular man who is arrived to the maturity of reason, is, (if any such be) his owne morall or private Magistrate. For the principle of a humane or morall action, is a minde acting freely according to vertue, and those lawes which are written within us. But if by a morall Magistrate, he meanes such a one only, as is seated over us, and hath a care that we live conformably to vertue, and honesty in relation to others; then it followes, that whoever hath the capacity so to hold inspection over us, is a sufficient Magistrate; but that can onely be he under whose full possession we actually are. Moreover he is to know againe, that States cannot looke so strictly after vertue, as after publique quiet. For morall vertue is a private thing, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the free concurrence of the will, cannot be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered certainely, but by those who are able to look with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man:<note place="margin">VVhy states cannot looke so strictly after vertue, as after publique quiet</note> But that which is <hi>ad alterum,</hi> and concernes rather wrong, then right, belongs to the Politicall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, as a thing which cannot without confusion have redresse otherwayes. For the chiefe convenience of a State, is, that people might be kept from inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or incommoding one another; and that they may be conserv'd in a liberty to doe other good things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Piety and honesty: So that he who doth things in themselves good, though under an unlawfull
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49850:11"/>
civill Magistrate, doth not by those acts assert any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates right; but his only who originally gave Law and Rules for those internall acts, and that is Gods right alone.</p>
            <p>Lastly, whereas in this argument, <hi>he saith a Father of a family so abused should in his required submission,</hi>

               <hi>sin, if he betrayed his place and power which God had naturally given him.</hi> I answer that there is a difference betwixt betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place so given, and loosing it by force (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is his first supposition) The one cannot be done without sin, because it is done voluntarily and totally by himselfe, but it is not our sin if we be forc't out of a place; to which we are compelled by a principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, and totally besides our power.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Of the Ecclips suspention and extinction of supream pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> First, How knowes he certainely that the other power is onely in an ecclipse or suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? or if it be onely in an Ecclipse, doth it follow that we of the People might not doe lawfull Actions by the suppliment of other lights, whilst we cannot have that of the Sun? Must we all that while cease to be men for the absence of that which we cannot help? The Presybterian party would not have that understood so; when the King was in prison at <hi>Holmby.</hi> There be no more suns in the world but one, but there are many Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and such who give better light one then the other, for which reason God first chose not Monarchy for the Jewes, certainly in an Ecclipse, the Sun is never out of his naturall Orbe, though his light and influence may be suspended and intercepted from us, but when a Prince is in a forraigne Country, and lives under the Lawes of another Magistracy, and that all Lawes and di

of Justice and Magistracy in the Country he pretends to, are made without him and against him, will you according to the Lawes of Nature, Nations, or Policy, say he alone, and in that condition, is the supreame power or Authority of that Country, or rather that we of the People do nothing but sinne in his absence, though we do things in themselves lawfull? If you will aske how he came to be out of his Orbe or Country,?<note place="margin">The union of people to a GoVernment not like a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> I am sure it was against the advice either of Presbyterian or Independent. It is easily granted, <hi>That a man may not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry another woman, so soone as his wife falls into a swound.</hi> But you must againe be reminded that the nature of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and of Government differ extreamly there, where you suppose them most to agree. For Marriage is not alwaies necessary to every particular man. But the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique body of a people cannot be without Government one day, no more then a man can be without a Head, because a smalltime serves to the ruine of a man. Secondly, to take this or that woman to wife, is a thing of free choice; but it is not so alwaies with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in relation to Kings, who have many of them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great Rapes upon them, as I beleeve this Gentleman will acknowledge.</p>

For first, we have been taught by all parties in this Warre, that a King of England is not as a Husband to the People of England. For a Husband is he who alone makes and abrogates the Laws of his owne Family, as a right of his propriety, which a King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land could not doe alone in this state.

But if by this he meanes that in matter of supreame Command, we of the People may not obey any but the Husband or the King,<note place="margin">Of taking away the Kings life.</note> why then did the Presbyterian party for so many years oppose, and not totally submit to their now supposed Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?

            <p>In his case of the Thiefe, I desire any man to consider whether (as he hath put it) he hath not clearely bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one Commandement, besides those which he hath named, <hi>viz.</hi> the third, because it is an untruth to say the Parliament requires not obedience from any of us, unlesse we all acknowledge the lawfulnesse of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which is the second false supposition here.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </note>I answer, that for so much as concerns the forme of my Oath here, it is true and certaine, that <hi>my minde and words</hi> went truly together in the act of swearing, and that I will make <hi>my deed and words</hi> goe truly together, when the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd condition betwixt us (and which, as we mutually consent to, is in neither of our powers at present) shall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely come to passe. This was the case of <hi>Abrams</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, when he swore to take a wife for <hi>Isaac</hi>; a future (in severall circumstances) very uncertaine,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.2.34.</note> both in respect of what might happen to the servant, to <hi>Isaac</hi> and to the Virgin we know what hapne'd to <hi>Iob's</hi> Children and Family through the accident of warre, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Devill; and how <hi>Ioseph</hi> was shuffled away by his owne friends and kindred.</p>
            <p>It is not enough to say, such suppos'd tacite conditions cannot be in Oathes;<note place="margin">Of tacite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in Oathes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things possible.</note> For first, If such conditions be in promises, and that I may lawfully make a promise to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, then I may lawfully sweare a promissory Oath to him, which we see cannot be separated from such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as are not, cannot, and need not be exprest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us at the beginning. For (to take away the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of fraud betwixt us) we both agree in this that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49850:23"/>
we cannot foresee with what circumstances our futures may be perplext. Therefore it is sufficient that we swore <hi>things not necessary, but possible</hi>; such as might happen or not happen, because depending on things which depend not totally on us, nor on our will, but rather mixtly on the wills of others, and on that which to us is change or fortune, For which reason he is not forsworne, who ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects not alwaies what he by Oath promiseth, no more then he sinnes, who alwaies effects not his simple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This tacite condition in a promissory Oath, and in things <hi>naturally and morally possible,</hi> is proved by the very nature and definition of the Oath. <hi>For it is onely an attestation, and imprecation of God in such manner, that if the promiser faile, he would have him to whom he promist, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that be puts himselfe under Gods severe wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it is to be noted,<note place="margin">The obligation of a pact, or promise with an Oath, or without an Oath, is all one</note> that the bare promise obliged as strictly before he swore, as after he swore; and of the reason is, because he was obliged by nothing, but by that which was in Pact. The investing it with an Oath, or with Gods punishment, relates onely to the <hi>Penalty</hi>: so that a promissory Oath signifies no more, then such a penalty upon such a promise: But a penalty (as we know) in law and equity relates onely to that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, such as is the violation of a Pact.</p>
            <p>The addition of never so many penalties, to a thing in it selfe unlawfull, can never fasten any obligation on me to doe it; Nor can severall Penalties to an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it selfe lawfull, adde anything to the first <hi>Ius</hi> or right of it, but onely <hi>to my future feare,</hi> least I doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</p>
            <p>The Capitall question therefore in these cases will be. What the nature of the things are to which we obliged our selves at first? For according as they stand or fall, our relations or obligations, to them stand or fall whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or no.</p>

            <p>By a reflection on all this, <hi>viz.</hi> That seeing there may be a promise, and consequently a promissory Oath; and that the nature and obligation of a promise, and of such an Oath, is one and the same, we have gain'd a great point, <hi>That the Covenant (which is a promissory Oath) is not in its owne nature of an eternall obligation,</hi> but is involved in tacite conditions and accidents of the world, which may justly incumber us from effecting it, or from being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obliged to it, as well as other promises may, which yet are made <hi>bonâfide</hi> at the beginning. The difficulty onely is to see, whither <hi>de facto</hi> that hath interven'd, which hath now taken away the <hi>formall and originall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> which we of the people had to it at first, by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Magistrate; and so taken away, as we may be secure and out of feare of the penalty, which we then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to in it.</p>

Besides it is a considerable circumstance in the Magistrates managing the whole, that states or civill constitutions by reason of the diseases of ambition and avarice, are naturally as much subject to future changes, as any other things are; and without the supposition of tacite conditions, we may as little sweare to preserve the State of a publique body, as we may sweare to preserve the State of our own particular bodies, or as a parent may to preserve his Childe, which when it shall be taken away by diseases, or by justice, he may be sorry for the losse, but may not justly complaine of it. And indeed so it is come to passe without any default in us of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish People, or of our publique Magistrate (under whom we were to act in these private places and callings) that neither of us can be said to have laid the Covenant aside, although we could not keepe it from expiring; because the failing was in that which was never suppos'd to be in our powers <hi>viz.</hi> in many conditionall things which camecr osse, and in the breach of fidelity in another col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall and concurring power.</p>

            <p>Thus we see how the Government is changed, and the formall obligation of the Covenant at an end; But what if I should grant you by the way of supposition, that in case both the Covenant and the former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were standing together in as full force as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and as it was when the Scots first delivered the King up to the Parliament of England?

            <p>
               <hi>You will say</hi> no, <hi>because the Parent did not as a party solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concurre to the Childs vow, and having never consented he might the better dissent; but our publique Parent did concurre at a party to our Oath.

            <p>To this I reply, First, that v.16. it is said the Childe is free after the dissent of the Parent, and that the Parent is charged with whatsoever was amisse in him, which is excuse enough for us of the people. Secondly, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is great in a maine point of the paralell; because after the concurrence of the Father to the childs vow for sacrificing something to God, that might be compleated in the Temple without his further helping it on; but we cannot doe any thing in our case without the coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our publique Parent all along, neither can he do any thing without the concurrences of many other pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, but uncertaine conditions, and if he in effect finde those conditions have come contrary to <hi>his publique en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,</hi>

A Law it was not because it was not made by all the then Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers of the Kingdome.

Why then should these men thinke the world so dull as not to understand plainly enough, that the Covenant provided for his Death more wayes then one? True it is, that the Covenant held out a faint and a conditionall preservation of him, and after all no man can sincerely stretch it further: From whence if we will let him judge this one controversie, he hath left it

            <p>I know the answer here is obvious, that bullets were not shot directly against him (as few are against any in a Towne or in a Battell) and that if he would have withdrawne his person, he should have beene out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but then I pray you what advantage had he in this by Covenant, more then any common souldier of either side? who when they retire, are equally out of danger, Nay he had lesse advantage, For by <hi>preserving him,</hi> they meant <hi>keeping him</hi> after he was rescued from others,<note place="margin">How the words of <hi>preservation</hi> in Covenant, provided more for the Kings suffering, then the words of punishment provided for Delinquents sufferings.</note> and by keeping him they meant <hi>not him primarily,</hi> but something else, to which all consideration of him was to give way. As for others which were to be brought to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they had some of them leave to go beyond the Seas, others to enjoy liberties at home; and of all the excepted persons, there was never any of them who was here deprived of life, but as our troubles and warres increast, their number (which was strange) lessen'd even to six or seven at last, and most of those out of the Kingdome.

            <p>To conclude, <hi>Either wee are still in the Vnion of the end of the Govenant, or we are not</hi>: If we be in it, then these breake the Covenant, by seeking to dis-unite us: If we be not in it, where then is the Article for our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate forming a warre upon it? and under whom, if not under our English supreame iudicatory?<note place="margin">The Covenant how more then broke by the Scots hostility.</note> and if they call us not out to revenge that which was more then a bare falling off from the Covenant last yeare amongst our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selves, (when the Scots exercis'd such high hostilities, and were the first shatterers of all our frame (which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise might by Gods blessing have cemented againe) how durst these private trumpets sound the alarum, and open the wounds of the Nations once more? Though the respective iudicatory of that Kingdome now cannot make that which was once done, undone; Yet by the present punishment of the Kirke, it is acknowledged that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49850:31"/>
they hold the Covenant to have been more then nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally broken, in regard of the harme and damage which was done to us after it was broken. For there is a great deale of difference betwixt ceasing to helpe according to a league, and acting hostily contrary to it, especially when no such penalty is in such a league exprest betwixt the parties.</p>

               </note> seeing it hath beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that that which is now nothing, cannot now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to any thing; and conseqently our submitting to, and acting under the present Government, cannot
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49850:32"/>
be contrary to Covenant; because things which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to the other, must have actuall being together at the same time. But the very being of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, supposes the nullity of the Covenant, whose death (as it was other where contrived before) gave life to that mutation here afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Covenant (of all oathes) interprets it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe least, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the positive Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which it would establish, and in Religion.</note>Secondly, Though the Covenant were still valid and in force, yet when we were sworne to it first, it found us actually out of that Government here pointed at, <hi>viz.</hi> Of King Lords and Commons. For that is the supreame Government of a Country, which makes a supreame law there: But at that time the supreamest humane law, which (according to these gentlemens opinions) was ever made in England or Scotland, or perhaps in all the world, was made without the King in those Kingdomes, and against his dissent. For which reason the Covenant engages not so positively for King or Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as for the Vnion of the Covenanters in any forme and against any opposition;<note place="margin">Though the Covenant were in Force, yet a change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with it.</note> Whereupon the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians when it was (as most conceiv'd) in their power, to restablish King or Kingly Gove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nment, they omitted both for many dayes of their lives, without question; because they conceiv'd it not a Government absolutely necessary by Covenant. When <hi>D. Hamilton</hi> entred Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land so hostilely for that end, and as he thought by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Covenant, yet he was excommunicated for it by the Oracles of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The reigne of the Covenant since the first day of its birth and obligation, was never yet a R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gall reigne, no not for one day anywhere; so that the change which is, is not determinatly contrary to that principle, out of which (according to the circumstances of security) any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may be moulded for any place. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son if I should grant you that the Covenant were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd, and had not beene so palpably broken, as it was betwixt the Nations; yet Scotland (if they had pleas'd) might have beene Govern'd by a King, and England by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49850:32"/>
a free State, &amp; yet both consonantly enough to Covenant and without any contrariety, because the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of securitie in one might have been different from the circumstances of security in the other; which though different, might as well have been mutually maintained as their discipline differing from ours might have beene preserv'd by us. From all which it appears, that that Oath is Cloudy in the positive or set Government which we ought to have, and so cannot be justly called it's <hi>owne interpreter,</hi> besides a reformation according to the word of God; and the example of the best reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, supposes such a latitude of Logick as would (if all sides should be heard) give us as much exercise as all our wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>res have.</p>
            <p>And certainly the Covenant is alike undefin'd in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and in civill Government.<note place="margin">How the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly points at some change of Government.</note> For we swore to bring the Church Discipline in the three Kingdoms, to as neer a similitude as the constitution of the places would bear, <hi>not into the very same</hi>; and as for the civill Government, it was to receive its <hi>forme</hi> in the security of that, just as water doth receive not onely the figure of the Pot or Glasse into which it is put, but its conservation from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing totally lost and spilt. But how then will you free your selfe from this contradiction in asserting that the civill State is unalterable by Covenant, when that of the Church which formes the other is so much alterable? and seeing that of the State receives from this, not only its form and being, but what ever else you alone please to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to your security in it? From whence I conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that a change of Government is consistent with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, &amp; that a submission to it in lawful things is much more, and consequently it ingages not to any one deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Government, and so is not against this of ours.</p>
            <p>I beleeve it hath been a frequent observation of many, who have calmely converst with our Divines and others zealous for Presbytery, That they have found them little satisfied with that sort of Presbytery, which

our Parliament modelled for us of this Nation; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little affinity with the Couenant.

That if the Scotch Presbitery come out of the Covenant then Kingly government cannot derive from it, because they are jurisdictions incompatible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistant in the same place, and if one can conserve it, then may we say as much of the other.

Their words are, <hi>That their King after his Oath of Coronation in</hi> Scotland, <hi>shall assure them under his hand and seale, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne the solmne League and Covenant, establish and practise the Prerbyteriall Government, Directory, Confession and Catechisme, as they are approved by the severall Assemblies of their Kirke and Parliament, in ALL HIS DOMINIONS, and that he shall never endeavour any change thereof.</hi>

So that though these things which here they would impose upon us perpetually, were never so good, yet they being unequitably deriv'd upon us from their supreame judicatory (in whose possession we are not so fully now, as they were last yeare in ours) we ought to abominate their designe, as much as they might the like obtrusion of their Presbitery from hence, without power there to rectifie it ever after.

This I speak not as desirous to detract any thing from the sacred function of the Ministery as it containes it selfe in its own function, no man being able rationally to object any thing wherefore some might

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Against Kings.</note>The first thing which was ever offer'd to him from the Kingdome of Scotland, was an authority by far trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending his own, <hi>viz.</hi> that of excommunication.

To backe this likewise the Commissioners of the Synode said (p. 22) that they negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with him in a capacity altogether,<note place="margin">Page 22.</note> distinct from the Commissioners of Parliament, as being persons commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by the Kirke, which is commisioned with a <hi>Ius<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>divinum</hi> Our Bishops certainly never undertook such a jurisdiction &amp; supremacy, and unlesse these had witnessed so much of themselves to all the world, no one would believe that in such a poore Country, and so much forme of Religion, there could be such high passions of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
            <p>Besides if it be a true rule, That he who is the maker, ought to be the interpreter of a Law, then let all the world observe one thing, That the Kirk having made the Covenant (as the principle of all supream rights both of State and Religion) then they alone ought to give the interpretation of it from time to time; as they <hi>de facto</hi> did not onely last yeare, contrary to the interpretation of their owne Parliament, but also for many yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether have peremptorily prest it upon ours: So that it makes a fundamentall change of Government there, though differently from what our Parliament hath made

            <p>It were in vaine to say <hi>the Kirke onely recommends their interpretation to the State.</hi>

our selves, why might it not by our Magistrates order, have been as well carried out of our Churches as the brazen Serpent was out of the Temple, after it was unhappily perverted to its wrong end?

            <p>The Reader may be pleased to take notice that though these replyes for the most part touch but on simple obedience to a Government sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unlawfull, but commanding lawfull things, yet they virtually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to our acting under such a Government. It is to be presumed that our adversaries not contesting profestly what hath been publiquely argued in that point, do conceive the difficulties of acting under invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in those of our submission to such a power. The distinction of <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Passive obedience,</hi> is but a nicety, and if one be not a sin, the other is not. They are in a manner the same thing, derive from the same Principle, and differ but gradually, just as the morning and the noone light do, which derive both from the same planet.

If this be otherwise, then (according to these authors opinion) we and all our forefathers have sinned, in obeying those actively or passively, who by unjust usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have come betwixt us and them, who derive from the first who were in compact, unlesse the Lapse of time can justifie the viciousnesse of an action (which is impossible) or that we may lawfully obey those who plenarily possesse and protect us, and command us lawfull things.</p>
