            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from their study by these childish bugbears. In
the midst of the two sides of this border in short
neeces sat two ougly figures, the one a woman
with a forked tongue, and snaky lockes, and
the vnder part of a Satyre, this Hagge held in her
hand a smiling vizard crown'd with Roses, and
was figured for Envie, vnder the Maske of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
On the other side was sitting as horrid a

and a Frog sitting on the fore part thereof; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
a Batt flying, this represented curions <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
The rest of the Border was fild vp with
severall fancies, which lest I should be too long

               <p>A Curtaine being drawne vp, the Lightsome

Hils a farre off was seated, a prospect of curious
Arbours of various formes. The first order of
marble Pillasters. Betweene which were neeces
of rocke worke and Statues; some spurting
water received into vazes beneath them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
standing on Pedestals. On the returnes of
these Pillasters run slender Cornishments. From
which was raised a second order of gratious
termes with womens faces which beare vp the
ornaments. Vnder this to a leaning height was
a Ballestrata inricht. All this second story seem'd
of silver worke mixt with fresh Verdures which
on the tops of these arbours covered some of the
returnes, in the forme of tipes with tender bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
dangling downe: others were cover'd flatt
and had flower pots of gold for finishing: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
these appear'd the tops of slender trees,
whose leaues seem'de to moue with a gentle
breath comming from the farre off Hills.</p>
               <p>Out of this pleasant place comes in hast, a yong
Gentleman, looking often backe, as if he feared
a pursuit; and beeing come into the midst of the

a farre off a Landscipt and a calme Sea which
did terminate the Horizon; in the hither part

               <p>When this was past, the <hi>Eagle</hi> with <hi>love</hi> flew

               <head>The Allegory.</head>
               <p>In the young Gentleman, who <hi>Circe</hi> had
first enamored on her Person, and after, through
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19100:10"/>
Iealousie conceiued, Transformed into a <hi>Lyon.</hi>
And againe remembring her former Love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>transform'd
into his former shape, is figured
an incontinent man, that striving with his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
is at last by the power of reason per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to flye from those Sensuall desires, which
had formerly corrupted his Iudgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Circe</hi> here signifies desire in generall, the
which hath power on all living Creatures, and
beeing mixt of the Divine and Sensible, hath
divers effects, Leading some to Vertue, and
others to Vice. Shee is described as a Queene,
having in her service, and subiection, the <hi>Nymphs,</hi>
which participate of Divinity, figuring the
Vertues, and the bruite Beasts, denoting the Vices.
The description of her person, of extraordinary
<hi>Beauty,</hi> and sweetnesse of her voyce, shewes that
desire is moved either by sight or hearing, to loue
<hi>Vertue,</hi> or the contrary, and the <hi>Beautifull</hi> aspect
of her inchaunted Palace, glistering with gold,
and Precious Ornaments, that desire cannot bee
moued without apparance of <hi>Beauty,</hi> either true
of false.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dryades,</hi> and <hi>Nayades, Nymphes</hi> of the
Woods, and Waters, that is to say; the good spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
defused through all the Vniverse, are servants
to this Queene, and liue with her in all Liberty
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19100:11"/>
and pleasure whose imployment is to gather
the most exquisite Herbes, and Flowers of the
earth for the service of their Mistres; Figuring the
<hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> by which the desire of Mans
Spirits are prepared and disposed to good, the
beasts, in part transformed, who contrary to
their Natures, make her sport, represents vnto vs
that Sensuall desire makes men loose their <hi>Vertue</hi>
and Valour, turning Parasites and Slaues to their
Bruitish affections. That these Intemperate
Beastes of <hi>Circes</hi> Court, should for a time possesse
<hi>TEMPE.</hi> The happie retreat of the Muses and
their followers, is meant, the inchantments of
vitious impostures, that by false meanes, seeke to
extirpate the true Louers of <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> to
whom of right only that place belongs.</p>
               <p>That divine <hi>Beauty</hi> accompan'ed with a troope
of Stars of a happy Constellation ioyning with
Heiroicke vertue should dissolue the inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and <hi>Circe</hi> voluntarily deliver her golden
rod to <hi>Minerva,</hi> is meant that a divine Beame
comming from aboue, with a good inclination,
and a perfect habit of vertue made, by the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
of the Irascible and concupiscible parts obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to the rationall and highest part of the
soule. Making man onely a mind vsing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

and affections as instruments; which being his
true perfection, brings him to all the happinesse
which can bee inioyed heere below.</p>
               <p>In Heiroicke vertue is figured the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
who therein transcends as farre common
men, as they are aboue <hi>Beasts,</hi> he truly being the
prototipe to all the Kingdomes vnder his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie,
of Religion, Iustice, and all the <hi>Vertues</hi>
ioyned together.</p>
               <p>So that Corporeall <hi>Beauty,</hi> consisting in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,

shining in the Queenes Maiestie, may draw vs
