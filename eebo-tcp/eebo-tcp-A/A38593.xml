         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Unto the Conſideration of all which, and
for the common Benefit of others, I was
moved to compoſe this little <hi>Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>
by occaſion of that very remarkeable
and ſpatious Earthquake which happened
in the South parts of <hi>Norway,</hi> the 24th.
of <hi>April,</hi> in this preſent Year 1657. about
a quarter of an hour before 12 a Clock at
Noon, when the Sun was in the 15th. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and the Moon above the
Earth in the firſt Degree of <hi>Aquarius,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98081:5"/>
and the ſame day hapned alſo the Planeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Aſpect, <hi>Quadratus Saturni &amp; Veneris,</hi>
and the following night, about 3 or 4 a
Clock in the Morning another particular
Earthquake began afreſh, but was not ſo
great as the former.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Earthquake which began
in the day, I have true and certain Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
That it stretched North and South,
from <hi>Oaſterdale, Sollewer, Totten
Wallyers, Ringer Rick,</hi> the upper and
lower <hi>Rummerick,</hi> down all along the
Land, and through all <hi>Weeken,</hi> almoſt
to <hi>Bawhouſe,</hi> above 160 Miles in
Length.</p>
            <p>And alſo from the Borders of <hi>Sweden</hi>
that lie Eastward of <hi>Norway,</hi> thwart o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the Land Weſtward as far as <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſneſſe,</hi>
being about 40 Miles more, and
it carried ſuch a noiſe and ſound along with
it, that the people at firſt knew not but it
was the noiſe of Thunder, until they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Houſes ſhook, and all their
Moveables, as Beds, Tables, and Benches,
to totter, and as it were dance with ſhaking.
<pb facs="tcp:98081:6"/>
As yet, I have not had a further Relation
concerning it, but poſſibly it might have
ſtretcht<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſelf much farther both in
breadth and length. Now this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
was ſo ſtrong and powerful, that it
ſhook the very Iſlands in the Sea, and the
great and ſmall Rocks in the freſh Lakes;
and by the very great concuſſion and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
did much amaze and terrifie thoſe
that were upon the water, and was more
eſpecially ſeen by ſuch as were upon the
great <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollands</hi> Ships, then
here, as alſo upon other Veſsels, Hoyes and
ſmall Boats. Yet it hath not done any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
harm (that is yet known) any
where in the Countrey; either to Houſes,
Walls, or other Buildings, for which we
ought to be very thankful to God, and to
receive it as an eſpecial Token of his Grace
and Mercy, as not ſignifying unto our
Countrey too very great Calamity or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>But nevertheleſs in regard that this
ſame Earthquake was of ſuch a length and
breadth, namely 160 miles in length, and
<pb facs="tcp:98081:6"/>
as much in breadth, contrary to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all thoſe Earthquakes that I ever
read of, we need not doubt but that it doth
fignifie ſome eſpecial and remarkable
Change and Alteration.</p>
            <p>And this puts me in mind of what the
ancient Hiſtoriographer <hi>Herodotus</hi> hath
recorded in his <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. That when any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
change or common calamity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
or is impendent over any Land,
or people, it is commonly made plainly
known by ſome ſuch unuſual preceding
Signes and Tokens. And this may be
more clearly verified by Examples out of
the Scriptures; for before the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
and their bordering Neighbours were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
and expelled by <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
this ſtrange Sign was ſeen, That
the water of <hi>Jordan</hi> contrary to its nature,
ſtood ſtill above, and ran out below, and
gave the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> a free paſsage through
upon dry ground, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe before the 5 Kings of the
<hi>Amorites</hi> were conquered, and their
Countrey poſſest by the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:98081:7"/>
Sun and the Moon ſtood ſtill each in his
Celeſtial ſtation, about the ſpace of <hi>a
whole Day, and a Night,</hi> Joſh. 10. 13.
Alſo before the <hi>Moabites</hi> were ſubdued by
the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi>
Water was turned into bloud, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi>
3. 22. I will not now ſpeak of the many
Signs and Tokens that preceded the Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen we ſeriouſly weigh and
conſider the inward and
outward nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the earth, which
God Almighty hath given
unto it for the benefit of Mankind;
not only that we ſhould have our being
and habitation upon it, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
our natural lives ſupport and
maintenance from it: Then we may
very well ſay with great Joy and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as the Kingly Prophet <hi>David</hi> did
in <hi>Pſalm 8. O Lord our Lord, how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and glorious is thy name in all the earth.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98081:8"/>
For we do in truth experimentally find,
That the earth is in every kind like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a loving and ſerviceable Mother, or
Nurſe unto us, and therefore is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
termed by that great Teacher of
the <hi>Oeconomicks,</hi> namely <hi>Sirach, The
Mother of us all,</hi> Chap. 40. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>For when we are born into the world,
the Earth entertaines us, and as long as
we live in the world, by her plenty and
liberality ſhe nouriſhes and ſuſtaines us,
and finally, when we ſhall at laſt depart
from hence again, ſhe like a tender
Mother, receives us, as it were into her
Boſom, or Lap, and preſerves us from
all that evil whereof this world is full,
and lets us reſt within her ſelf in peace,
until the laſt day; when ſhe ſhall make
ſuch perfect reſtitution of us again, that
ſhe ſhall not ſuffer the leaſt Joynt or
Member of us, to be loſt or periſh; no
not a hair, or one drop of Bloud, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Job</hi> comforteth himſelf in his
great miſery, in the 19th. Chap. of the

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98081:8"/>
And beſides this, we can never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
conceive and apprehend what
rich Treaſure and precious Jewels the
Earth retaineth within it ſelf, partly
hidden, and partly diſcoverable, ſome
whereof ſhe yearly diſtributeth to her
Inhabitants. None of the four Elements
is more conſtantly near us, or a more
faithful, and continual Aſſiſtant unto us
then the Earth.</p>
            <p>For the Elements of Water and Ayr
do often much damnifie and endanger
us; the Element Fire is too high for
us, or elſe might do us good by its
warmth and operation, yet ſometimes
by Thunder and Lightning doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
affright and hurt us. But the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Earth only, as a faithful Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Mother, never forſakes us, ſo long
as the world endures, but without ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
doth conſtantly aſſiſt us in Life
and Death, in Proſperity and Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſo that we are never forſaken of her
in this World, no not after Death.</p>
            <p>And who can ſufficiently conceive or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98081:9"/>
expreſs the wonderful Operations and
Labours which the Earth yearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes
and performes, night and day for
our ſakes? She hath never any reſt,
neither outwardly nor inwardly. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſhe produces and provides graſs
and Hay for thoſe Creatures which are
appointed by God to cloath and feed
us; and alſo ſeveral fruitful Trees, each
according to his kind, in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
Likewiſe divers ſorts of Herbs,
as well for our delight, as Food, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
and preſervation of our healths.
Beſides great variety of Corn, as wheat,
Rie, Barley, Peaſe, Oates, and divers
other ſorts of Grain, which afford us
neceſſary Maintenance and Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p>Inwardly ſhe workes and produces
for us many kinds of Minerals, Metals,
and precious Stones, which thoſe that
labour in the Mines know well how
ſuch her Treaſure to ſearch for, find,
and get, out of the depth of her Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
and bring them to light and uſe.
So that we may ſufficiently ſee and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98081:9"/>
that God Almighty hath his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial
<hi>Laboratorium,</hi> or Work-houſe,

Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Iron,
Lead, Braſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Multitudes of
precious Stones.</p>
            <p>But now, when this <hi>Laboratorium</hi>

Ch. 3. v.</hi> 5. Then certainly there muſt
be ſomething out of order ſomewhere,
that doth ſignifie ſome eſpecial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
thing.</p>
            <p>Moreover touching ſuch things as
Nature doth ſo work and produce in
the innermoſt parts and bowels of the
Earth, they do partly ſhew themſelves
openly above the earth, and do often
break out both to the greateſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and terrour of men: Such are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98081:10"/>
Meteors, that is, Fogs, Miſts, bright
burning Damps, like a flame that flies
about, which the Vulgar in <hi>Denmarke</hi>
call the <hi>Lanthorn-man,</hi> and alſo Rings
about the Sun and Moon, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
moveable Light in the Heavens,
which often ſhewes like Souldiers
fighting, Ships ſayling, two or three
Sunnes together, and the like; All
which is cauſed partly by only earthiſh,
and partly by earthiſh and wateriſh
Mixtures and Damps together, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the wonderful workings
of Nature within the earth.</p>
            <p>And this we may be aſſured of, that
there happens no ſuch admirable and
powerful effects of Nature above the
Earth, but that there is far greater, and
more wonderful operations below and
within the earth, by the various work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Concoctions of Nature, partly
by ſubterraneous water, and partly by
ſubterraneous fire.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Learned and wiſe
Searchers and Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
into Nature deny
not, but that ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
as the waters in
the innermoſt parts of the Earth have
their courſe through, and do cover,
ſteep and ſoak, do give the ſame wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98081:11"/>
ſeveral and diſtinct vertues, ſmels,
qualities, taſts, and colours. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
The water that runs through,
ſteeps, ſoakes, or covers Brimſtony or
Victrilliſh earth, hath a far different
nature, vertue, taſt, and colour, from
that which runs through Salt-Peteriſh,
Allomiſh, or Limiſh earth; but they
will by no meanes grant that Brimſtone
Bitumen, or other ſuch ſtuffe which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
and ſuddenly takes fire above the
Earth, ſhould ſo heat thoſe ſeething
hot Springs within the earth, which do
ariſe in ſeveral places thereof, becauſe
the fire is not after ſuch a manner ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
contained and hidden in them,
as it is in a Flint, Steel, or in <hi>Calce viva,</hi>
that is, unſlak't Lime; for aſſoon as the
Flint and Steel is forcibly ſtruck toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they do preſently produce appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
fire. And when water toucheth, or
is caſt upon unſlak't Lime, it kindles it
ſelf, and preſently diſcovers the ſecret
nature of the fire that is in it, and that ſo
plainly, that it will quickly ſet any thing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98081:11"/>
a fire that will be kindled by fire.</p>
            <p>And therefore we muſt not think
that either the heat of the Sun, or <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
continui,</hi> ſtrong and perpetual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which do otherwiſe occaſion great
heat here on earth, and ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
fire in Nature, or the inward
Warmth of the earth, or any other
ſubſtance which the ſubterraneous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have their courſe through within
the earth, can be the cauſe of the ſaid
waters being ſo boyling hot, as it is in
the hot Bathes, and in many other
places of the Earth where it ſprings
up; but it muſt be the ſubterraneous
fire it ſelf, to which it only and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belongs <hi>in altiſſimo Caloris gradu,</hi>
to heat it in ſo high a degree. Which
fire without doubt is kindled in ſeveral
parts of the earth, when the ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
water forceth it ſelf <hi>per ſubterraneos
meatus,</hi> or the ſubterraneous paſſages
and pores of the Earth, where <hi>Calx vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
or other ſuch kind of inflameable
matter is, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98081:12"/>
And it is here to be obſerved, That
<hi>Bitumen</hi> (by us called <hi>Jewes Lime)</hi> will
burn in the water, without having any
ayr, but then it muſt firſt be ſet on fire
above the water in the open Ayr, and
when it is kindled, it will not be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by water, no more then burning
Pitch or Tarre will; but the more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is caſt upon it, the fiercer it burnes.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a Stone called <hi>Gagates,</hi>
that will burn vehemently in the
water; which <hi>Galen</hi> did ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
that only to find and ſee it, he
ſail'd with great danger of his Life
round about <hi>Lycia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Brimſtone is a ſubſtance found
in the Earth, which is eaſily kindled
when it is above the Earth, but it will
not burn except it have Ayr, whence
it may readily be obſerved, that it is not
Brimſtone, but <hi>Bitumen,</hi> or <hi>Calx viva,</hi>
or ſome other ſubſtance yet unknown,
which is the thing that ſo burneth in
the ſubterraneous waters, and from
whence they receive ſuch their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98081:12"/>
heat, that in many places of
the Earth they ſpring up ſo extream
boyling hot, that one may ſcald Swine,
Fowle, or the like in them, and that ſo
ſuddainly, that a man can ſcarce dip
them into thoſe warers before the hair
and feathers come off: and if one hold
them never ſo little in, their very fleſh
will be boyled from the bones, like
ſome hot Springs in <hi>Iſland,</hi> and in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi>
as <hi>Thermae, Badenſes,</hi> and the
like.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort of hot ſprings, called in
Latine <hi>Thermae,</hi> and by us commonly
called hot Baths; There are enough
to be found in ſeveral countreys and
kingdoms, but eſpecially in <hi>Germany:</hi>
as <hi>Leuker Bath</hi> in <hi>Walliſſen Land</hi> by the
Alpes of <hi>Poeninas, Thermae, Badenſis</hi> in
<hi>Hegoja,</hi> the <hi>Wild Bath</hi> in the Land of
<hi>Wittemberg, Wiſſ-Bath</hi> in the Land of
<hi>Heſſen:</hi> one by <hi>Elbogen</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and
another at <hi>Achan</hi> in <hi>Brabant.</hi> And that
there is a great and dreadful fire in the
innermoſt parts of the earth; a man
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98081:13"/>
may apparently ſee and underſtand by
thoſe Mountains that do perpetually
flame and burn without ceſſation, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a terrible proſpect, and yearly caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up vaſt quantities of Brimſtone,
Pumiſtone, and other burnt ſtuff like
that of a Smiths Forge, which the earth
works and caſts up of it ſelfe, through
ſuch open <hi>hiatus</hi> or holes, by the heat
and force of the ſubterraneous fire,
where the ſaid fire hath (as I may ſay)
its breathing places.</p>
            <p>Such a Mountain there is in <hi>Iſland</hi>
called by <hi>Coſmographis Mons Heckla,</hi> and
by the Inhabitants <hi>Hecklefield:</hi> the ſame
Mountain burns continually with a
blue brimſtone-like and moſt dreadful
flame, caſting up, and beſtrowing the
fields round about with ſuch great
quantities of Brimſtone, that divers
Ships may yearly be loaden off with it;
and it oft times ſtrews the Land with
ſo many aſhes and other burnt ſtuff,
that the Countrey for the ſpace of ten
miles round about, can yield no profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98081:13"/>
increaſe; and when it burns with
greateſt vehemence (for it burns ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more fiercely then others) it
makes a terrible rumbling, like the noiſe
of loud Thunder, and a fearful crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and tearing, that may be heard a
long way off by the Inhabitants, and
ſuch as ſail by it. The fire of this ſame
Mountain is of a ſtrange quallity and
nature, it can burn and conſume water,
but cannot ſet on fire or conſume Tow.

               <hi>Anno</hi> 1626. did this mountain of <hi>Heck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
break out with ſuch a flame, that it
caſt terrible &amp; unuſual pieces of fire out,
which flew round about a great way,
and burnt up many Houſes, and did ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repairable
miſchief to the Land: and
according to intelligence, the aſhes of
that fire flew about certain hundreds
of miles: and was alſo ſeen in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moſt parts of <hi>Norway,</hi> which ſeems
to be impoſſible: yet it is related for
certain that it was ſo. The late Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers
do write very ſtrangely
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98081:14"/>
cerning ſuch things as do yearly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
by, and about this mountain.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Campania</hi> hard by <hi>Neapolis</hi> there
is alſo a burning mountain called <hi>Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
or as ſome call it, <hi>Veſevus,</hi> which
alſo burns continually without ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This mountain hath ſeveral times
beſtrewed the Land thereabouts with
ſo many aſhes, that they have cover'd
the tops of the trees in the adjacent
woods. In the time of <hi>Titus Veſpatian.</hi>
And <hi>Fl. Domitian,</hi> the ſame moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
caſt up ſuch a fire, that two
Towns were burnt by it, and alſo cauſed
ſuch a mighty and thick ſmoak, that it
wholly deprived the Sun of its light
all over <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo that the day there
was as dark then as the darkeſt night;
And it alſo beſtrew'd the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
with ſuch an infinite and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
quantity of aſhes, that it was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
over as with a great Snow: which
aſhes were ſo blown and carried about
by the winds, that they flew to <hi>Africa,
Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria. Munſter lib. 2. de Italia.</hi>

the 5. the ſaid <hi>Veſuvius</hi> did
very great harm. And in the year 1538.
it broke out freſh again with a terrible
and dangerous fire, and an Earthquake,
and made a fearful deep hole in the
earth, in plain and even ground, and
round about the ſame hole caſt up a
mighty deal of earth like unto a great
mountain. <hi>Munſter ibidem.</hi>

               <hi>Pliny</hi> that great Naturaliſt, when he
endeavouring to profound the nature of
this burning mountain, went too neer
the mouth of the hole in the top of it,
was choakt by the ſmoak and damp of
the ſaid fire, and loſt his life.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sycillia</hi> there is alſo ſuch a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
called <hi>Etna,</hi> which in old time was,
and is yet much ſpoken of for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
caſting up of fire and brimſtone:
whoſe fire is only ſeen at nights, and
nothing but ſmoak a days, except
when it breaks out very vehemently:
then the fire may be ſeen day and
night. In the year 1537. the ſame
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98081:15"/>
Mountain caſt up a great piece of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Brimſtone into the Air, which fell
down again in ſeveral places in pieces,
and ſpoiled the adjacent Countreys,
Woods and Villages.</p>
            <p>The precedent year, namely 1536.
the 22. of <hi>March,</hi> did this Mountain of
<hi>Etna</hi> begin to caſt out a moſt terrible
fire, ſo that the whole Countrey was
amazed and trembled at it: and there
was ſuch a dreadful Earthquake, with
a crackling and ratling noiſe, that many
dyed for very fear; and the aſhes which
that ſame fire caſt up, cover'd over
not only <hi>Sycillia,</hi> but alſo <hi>Calabria</hi> (a
Province in <hi>Italy)</hi> like a great Snow.</p>
            <p>The Learned Philoſopher <hi>Empedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
was choak't and deſtroy'd by this
mountains fire and ſmell: when he to
ſatisfie his curioſity concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and qualities thereof, went too
neer the hole.</p>
            <p>Philoſophers give the reaſon and
cauſe of ſuch wonderful and continual
burnings to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98081:15"/>
Earth is hollow in many places within
it ſelfe, (as ſhall be further declared in
the fourth chapter) and is full of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
Bitumen, and other kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which can feed the fire; As alſo
unſlakt Lime and Water, by which the
ſubterraneous fire is eaſieſt and oftneſt
kindled; Now the fire cannot burn
except it have Air, or, (as we may ſay)
a breathing place: And therefore it is
thought that <hi>Therma</hi> or thoſe hot
Baths that are found in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
muſt be certain <hi>Spiracula,</hi> or
breathing holes, by which the ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
fire doth in ſome kind get air
unto it: and when the air, by what
means ſoever it be, gets into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
places in the earth where the fire
is; Then that fire increaſeth into a
flame and maketh burning coals, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Embers as it were, even in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt
parts of the earth. Therefore
it cannot be doubted, but there muſt
needs be great and wonderful, yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<hi>Meatus,</hi> ways or paſſages, in, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98081:16"/>
under the earth, through which the heat
and flame of the oft named ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fire, hath in ſeveral places its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
until it gets an open <hi>Spiraculum</hi> or
breathing hole through ſuch flaming
mountains. Here it is to be noted
that thoſe flaming mountains do not
burn always alike outwardly, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more, and ſometimes leſſe for
ſuch reaſons as this: When the <hi>Hiatus</hi>
or hole which is above in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is ſtopt with any kind of ſtuff, ſo
that the fire is ſmother'd and cannot
have its free air or breathing-place, then
it goes out, though not quite, but
burns notwithſtanding below in the
earth; and only ſends forth ſome few
ſparkles or ſmall flame, and ſometimes
nothing but only ſmoak, and a ſtinking
burnt damp ſmell above the earth,
which ſheweth that the fire below in
the earth is not dead or wholly quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but burns and works faintly under
the earth, as long, as till either the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
hole opens again, or it cannot
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98081:16"/>
break through and make another <hi>Hia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
or breathing hole, and then breaks
out afreſh again with ſo much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
power and vehemence, not without
doing great miſchief and dammage
to the adjacent places, as is afore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p>Now from hence may any man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
underſtand and obſerve, that
by the power, operation, and force
of ſuch fire, in, and under the earth,
there muſt needs be a boyling, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

earth: and the ſame mixture either by
the powerful influence of the Planets,
or by the heat of the oft named ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
Fire and warm waters, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
and well boiled together: then
there is produced a Mineral according
to the nature of the ſubſtances which
are mixt together. Alſo when the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
waters in their ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98081:17"/>
or courſes under the earth, do
happen to cover over, ſoak or ſteep, any
kind of mettal ſo long, that they do
contract &amp; gather a thickneſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from it, and become like unto
troubled waters above the earth: and
the ſame waters (afterwards) comes
where the fire is; or the heat of the
ſubterraneous fire doth penetrate and
force it ſelfe through to the ſame wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
then there is boiled of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a certain moiſt ſubſtance or matter,
which in time comes to be a hard and
ſolid Mineral, according to the nature
of that mettal which the waters did ſo
cover, ſoak, or ſteep; and from which
it had gathered its quality or thickneſs
under the earth. Moreover, when ſuch
thick, troubled, and changed ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
waters continue long in a place
without motion: then that quality with
which it is ſo thickned, mixt, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
ſettles it ſelf to the bottom, (as
any thick and troubled water naturally
doth) where it remains; and when
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98081:18"/>
the water gets any kind of paſſage out,
it runs away; and that which is left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
in the bottom is dryed and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the power and influence of the
Sun and Planets, and alſo by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
air or heat wrought into a
Mineral, ſuitable to the nature and
quality of that, from whence the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
waters that are run away,
had gathered and received its thickneſs.
And this may now be more eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
and underſtood by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
examples.</p>
            <p>When the waters have their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and paſſage through that earth
which is full of Copper and ſuch like
Ore, and covers, ſoaks, or ſteeps it
ſo long and often, that it becomes
thick and muddy, and its nature
throughly altered and changed, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the quality thereof. And the
ſame waters afterward by the heat of
the fire, or the power and influence
of the Planets, is boyled and diſtilled
in the earth: then it becomes a <hi>Succus</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:98081:18"/>
or natural green moiſt ſubſtance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
being dryed, comes the Mineral
called <hi>Chryſocolla,</hi> (that is <hi>Mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green)</hi>
and <hi>Virdigreaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner when the ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
waters covers over, ſoaks, or ſteeps
<hi>pyriten aeroſum &amp; friabilem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that is a
ruſty Firrſtone, which is eaſily ground
to pieces, and is called in High-Dutch
<hi>Kys:</hi> then it becomes a bitter <hi>Succus,</hi>
which afterwards turns to <hi>Victril,</hi> and
<hi>Alumen liquidum,</hi> that is Allom.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe where the ſubterraneous
waters, or liquid ſubſtances have their
courſes and paſſage thorough, or into
Gold and Silver Ore: then it becomes
<hi>Lithargyrium Aureum &amp; Argenteum,</hi>
that is Litharidge of Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>Nor muſt we think that all Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
are produced in the earth after
this manner now ſpoken of; but ſome
after this manner, and ſome otherwiſe,
by the influence of the Planets and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occult natural cauſes, which ought
to put us in mind of the omnipotency
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98081:19"/>
of God, who by nature worketh the
rough and unſhapen earth, and earthiſh
liquid ſubſtances, into ſuch ſeveral, very
neceſſary, and precious Minerals and
Mettals, for the great benefit and good
of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And it is alſo found by experience
that many Minerals are ſo perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
and wrought below in the earth,
that they do afterwards ſpring up of
themſelves thorough the Clefts and
Cranies of the Rocks, like a pot that
ſeeths and runs over.</p>
            <p>As touching Mettals, they are by
nature wrought and produced below in
the earth, after divers ſecret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
ways and manners, yea
even amongſt and within the hard
ſtones and mighty mountainous Rocks
by which in like manner we have cauſe
given to conſider the omnipotency and
bounty of God, whereby he in ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
and inconceivable a manner,
doth change earth and ſtone into Gold,
Silver, Iron, Copper, Tinn, Lead, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98081:19"/>
other very neceſſary Mettals for the
profit and benefit of man. And as the
Fiſh is never ſo deep in the main Sea
and other great waters &amp; ſtreams, but it
is brought up for the food and ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man; in like manner is Gold,
Silver, Iron, Braſs, Tinn, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
never ſo deep below in the earth, nor
ſo hard faſtned in, and between the
hard rocks under it; but that by the
Almighty power of God, and the
Art and Labour of thoſe that work in
the Mines, it is brought up to light,
for the uſe and great benefit of Man.
Concerning which, <hi>Job</hi> in his <hi>28 chap.
1, 2 verſes,</hi> writes thus. <hi>The Silver hath
its ſecret paſſage, and the Gold its place,
Iron is taken out of the earth, and Stone
is melted into Copper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such favour hath the goodneſs and
omnipotency of God ſhewed now in
theſe laſt times of the world, unto this
Land and Kingdom of <hi>Norway,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſince the year 1623. when that rich
and famous Silver Mine in <hi>Sanſwerd,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98081:20"/>
and ſince that, time after time, the rich
Copper-Mine in <hi>Ewſter-dale,</hi> and <hi>Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands-dale</hi>
as well as the excellent Iron-Mine
in <hi>Hedemarken,</hi> and other places,
were found out &amp; improved to the great
and profitable advancement of Trade.</p>
            <p>And here is eſpecially to be noted,
that Mettals are not diſcovered and
brought to light and uſe in all places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſoone, but ſome in one <hi>ſeculo</hi> or
century of years, and ſome in another.
After two, three, or more hundred
years time: and the reaſon is, becauſe
they are not ripe all alike ſoone, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
wrought and prepared; as the
fruits of Trees or Herbs of the field,
are ſome of them ſooner, and ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ripe; and that becauſe ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
are ſo deep below in the earth, that
they cannot ſo ſoon grow up, and ſhow
themſelves above, or upon the earth;
nor can be perfectly wrought and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
ſo ſoon as thoſe Metals that are
placed higher up in the earth; and it
is alſo partly becauſe many Countreys
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98081:20"/>
and places that are full of Ore, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talliſh
ſubſtances do yet lie ſo far from
the Suns and Planets Courſes which
principally works and prepares them:
yea even in the deepeſt and innermoſt
places of the earth, that they cannot
come ſo ſoon to maturity, or be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and brought to uſe ſo ſoon, as
thoſe Mines that are in the <hi>Southern</hi>
Countreys, either neerer, or under the
Suns and Planets courſes.</p>
            <p>And hence it is that the Mines in
theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Countreys, eſpecially
here in <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> (whoſe
<hi>Southermoſt</hi> borders lie not above 34.
degrees from the <hi>Artick</hi> or <hi>North</hi>-pole,
but the <hi>Northermoſt</hi> reaches up to 71.
degrees of <hi>North</hi> Latitude) lying far
from the Sun and the other Planets
courſes and operations, have not ſo
ſoon come to maturity, as thoſe Mines
in the <hi>South</hi> countreys, and alſo in the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> which lye but 30
or 40 degrees from the Equinoctial on
both ſides: from whence great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98081:21"/>
of Gold and Silver hath been, and
is now yearly brought into theſe <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countreys.</hi> For the heat of the Sun,
and the power of the Planets, by their
preſence there, have a far greater force
and influence in their operation, then
they have here with us, where they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come ſo neer: and beſides their
power and influence is much obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that natural froſt and cold which
is here ſo neer under the Pole.</p>
            <p>It is therefore well worth the notice,
that when any Ore-Mine is found here
in <hi>Norway,</hi> (as happens often, and in
many places) which upon tryal is found
to yield good and fine Metal, or Ore,
though not ſo rich as to defray all
charges; that therefore ſuch Mines
ought not to be wholly neglected and
ſlighted, but diligently regiſtred, and
taken notice of, for the benefit of our
poſterity: becauſe the Ore ſheweth
that there is good and fine Metal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
in that Mine; and poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deeper ſearcht into, would be found
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98081:21"/>
rich enough: but if it ſhould not then
be able to bear the charges; it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Metal ſo found, is not yet
ripe enough, and come to perfect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,
which in time may be; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Nature, and the Planets may do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much in halfe a hundred, or a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years; ſo that what is not yet ripe
enough, and come to full perfection in
our time, may be more ripe, and come
to better maturity, in proceſſe of the
time of our poſterity, to the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
benefit, and advantage of theſe
Kingdoms hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now when Metals are thoroughly
prepared and come to their maturity,
and perfection under the earth, then
they do diſcover themſelves above the
earth; (like as the fruits of trees, when
they are ripe enough, fall down of
themſelves,) ſhewing thereby that they
are now ripe, or fit to be digged up and
uſed.</p>
            <p>And it is related amongſt us, that
the rich Silver-Mine in <hi>Sanſwerd</hi> by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98081:22"/>
               <hi>Dram,</hi> did diſcover it ſelfe, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and putting forth its Ore through
the cracks, and clefts of the ſtones
in that rocky Mountain, in the year
1623.</p>
            <p>And it happens often, that when
the Countrey people here, do burn the
wood off from ſuch great places where
they intend to ſow Corn, that the
force and vehemence of the fire reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
into the Rocks, and makes them
glowing hot, and then the melted Ore
or Metal, runs out of their clefts and
cracks, whereby they are often diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
and in time improved.</p>
            <p>It is alſo to be admired how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
nature doth prepare and produce
ſeveral ſorts of Ore in ſtrange forms,
and ſhapes: ſuch as are whole pieces of
pure Silver, or Copper, in the ſhapes
of Men, Women, Horſes, Fowls, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
Dragons, Trees, and the like:
which have been really found both in
the Silver and the Copper-Mines here
in <hi>Norway,</hi> and are ſafely reſerved by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98081:22"/>
ſuch as are partners in the Mines, as
miracles of nature.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe certain, that there are
divers Spirits found in many of the
Ore Mines: amongſt which ſome do
the workmen no harm at all, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
wander up and down below in the
Mines, and ſeem to imitate the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
in the Mine, in doing all kind of
work after an Apiſh, Antick faſhion;
ſome ſeem to hew the Ore looſe, ſome
to fill that which is hewen, into tubs,
and to wind it up: ſome ſeem to haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the reſt to follow their work, and yet
they do nothing at all, but only mock
the Labourers in the Mines; and theſe
are moſt frequently ſeen in thoſe Mines
where much Ore is ſhortly after
found.</p>
            <p>But ſome of theſe Spirits are ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and pernitious in ſome places,
that they do deſtroy and kill the Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
in the Mines, infeſting and expelling
them, ſo that they are forced wholly to
give over, and forſake the Mines, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98081:23"/>
repair to other places, as it hapned at
<hi>Anneberg</hi> in <hi>Elſatz</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> at a
M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne-pit then called <hi>Corona Roſacea,</hi> or,
<hi>Roſen Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here is to be obſerved that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth often, yea, for the moſt part,
mix more ſorts then one together, as
Gold, Silver, and Copper; as alſo Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Copper, Tinn, and Lead, one with
another; from whence this word Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
derives its name from the Greek,
<hi>quaſi</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the one mixt with the
other.</p>
            <p>And moreover, beſides this, Nature
doth ſometimes work and produce
Metals below in the earth, that are
found to be hard, tight, and ſolid: as
if they had been caſt, or wrought with
the hammer, but ſometimes, and moſt
commonly it is found growing in, and
mixed with ſtone: ſo that the Ory
ſtones muſt be beaten with peſtles as in
a morter, and then the Ore-power
melted in Furnaces, and afterwards
refined from the droſſe, before any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98081:23"/>
thing can be made of it.</p>
            <p>And this may ſuffice to be ſpoken
concerning ſeveral Minerals and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and how wonderfully they may be
wrought and changed, within, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the earth, and do help to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of great Earthquakes.</p>

rule; <hi>non datur vacuum in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
natura;</hi> that is, there is nothing
found empty in Nature; whence it
follows that all things over or under
the earth, muſt of neceſſity be full, or
filled with ſomething, eſpecially with
one or more of the four Elements;
which be, Fire, Air, Earth, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and where none of the viſible Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98081:24"/>
are, there the Air is preſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thin, ſubtile, and inviſible body,
that fils up all places and things every
where, which ſeem to our eies to be
empty; the which we may eaſily try
and experiment, by putting a hollow
Reed, Straw, or Feather, into Wine,
Beer, Water, or other liquid ſtuff;
yea, though it were Sand, or looſe
Earth; and afterwards ſtrongly ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, and drawing to us the Air that
is in the hollow reed or ſtraw; we do
preſently ſee, that before the reed, or
ſtraw will be empty, the heavy ſtuff
that is below, will come up into and fill
the hollow place in it, until it can reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
its loſt air again; the ſame may be
perceived when one drinks Tobacco:
for when the Air is ſuckt out of the
pipe into the mouth, then before the
hollow of the pipe will be empty, the
ſmoak is forced as it were by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of nature, to forſake the fire that is
in the tobacco, to fill up the hollowneſs
of the pipe, leaſt it ſhould be empty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:98081:24"/>
Now the earth within, is not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
cloſe and tight, but cleft and
parted one piece from another in many
places. And there are alſo many Rocks,
and great ſtones below in it, that have
their Clefts, Cracks, and Cranies,
which are wide and large, and as it
were hollow and empty; beſides, the
earth in many places is ſunk down
from the Corners, Angles, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eveneſs
of thoſe Rocks, and Stones,
which makes many great, hollow, and as
it were, empty places within the earth.</p>
            <p>And beſides this, the earth is on all
ſides environed with water, and is with
ſeveral Seas, and running ſtreams, both
ſalt and freſh, enterlac't, and filled, as
the body is with veins: and is alſo with
great and long Rains often wet and
moiſtned, by which means ſhe is ſoakt
thorough with water: and the ſame
water in time gets into thoſe hollow
places below in the earth, but being
hindred in its courſe to ſuch places,
doth again ſpring up in certain places
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98081:25"/>
of the earth, as may by ſeveral Springs
be perceived and obſerved; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
all this, there muſt needs be a
wonderful great water in the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
parts of the earth, which <hi>Moſes,</hi>
that man of God, the writer of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the worlds foundation, calls
the fountains of the great deep, <hi>Gen.
7. chap. 11. ver.</hi> and <hi>8. chap. 2. ver.</hi>
which ſprings up in many places ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,
both hot and cold: that it
makes great and rapid ſtreams above
the earth. Now where ſuch great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
under the earth, cannot break for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and force themſelves thorough
to thoſe hollow places in the earth:
there the Air being a more thin and
ſubtile body than the water, forceth
it ſelfe through, and fils them. For as
the moiſture, humours, and ſpirits do
often force themſelves through the
Pores of a mans warm body, or a horſe
that ſweats, through whoſe thick
hide, the humours and moiſture ſo
pierces, that the Horſe ſeems to ſmoak
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98081:25"/>
again with reek. In like manner the
Air goes about to and fro below in the
earth, ſeeking to fill thoſe hollow and
empty places, according to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of nature, which ſuffers nothing
to be empty, as is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>Now when ſuch hollow places are
filled with ſubterraneous water, or
with other ſtuff, then is the incloſed
Air, expelled, and forced thence: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up out of thoſe holes, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above the earth, as a thick fogg,
miſt, or ſmoak: which in Latine is
called <hi>halitus, exhalationes, evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones:</hi>
but we here in <hi>Norway,</hi> call it
a miſt, whereof ſome are thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then others, and of different colours,
according as the ſaid Air ſo ariſing and
expelled, hath contracted its thickneſs
and colour from that moiſture below
in the earth, with which it was mixed
and incloſed.</p>
            <p>And then if the earth be ſo cloſe,
Tight, and ſolid, that the Air cannot
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98081:26"/>
ſo ſuddainly get paſſage to depart away,
it breaks out by force; and when
this conflict and breach betwixt the
ſubterraneous Air and Water happens:
then the earth (as the ſeat of this warr)
muſt certainly quake, tremble, ſhake,
and be moved; and this is called <hi>Terrae
motus,</hi> that is an Earthquake: whereof
the following chapter more plainly and
particularly diſcourſeth.</p>
            <p>And that there is no little Air, or
Wind in the hollow places of the
earth, we may apparently perceive,
when it breaks forth in Earthquakes:
for then we ſee that it can caſt great
ſtones up into the Air, and lift up the
earth: yea great Mountains, and make
ſuch a terrible quaking of the earth,
that mighty Citys and Towns, Caſtles
Fortreſſes, high Towers, and Walls,
great Churches and Buildings, have
been thereby utterly overthrown, ſunk,
and loſt; as it is Recorded concerning
the great and mighty City of <hi>Antioch</hi>
in <hi>Aſia:</hi> which in the year of Chriſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98081:26"/>
528. was wholly deſtroyed by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
and there was 4870 perſons

Walls, and Buildings.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in the year of Chriſt 1509.
the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> the City of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was very much defaced
and ſpoiled by a dreadful Earthquake,
which continued 18 days: for it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
that long, thick, and ſtrong
wall, which ſtood along by the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and all the houſes that ſtood neer
it, to the ground, and fill'd up the
Motes and Ditches without the walls,
with Rubbiſh, Stones, and Chaulk,
that one might have gone dry-ſhod o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them; The ſame Earthquake ſhook
down that part of the <hi>Grand-Signiors
Pallace</hi> where the Treaſury was: and
five great and ſtrong Towers quite and
clean; and beſides all the miſchief that
it did by Sea and Land, which could

            <p>But other Divines do acknowledge
that Earthquakes have alſo their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
cauſes, by which God Almighty
doth occaſion their production; and to
ſpeak Phyſically to this: Naturaliſts do
deſcribe it thus.</p>
            <p>An Earthquake, is a violent, moving,
ſtirring, ſhaking, or quaking of the earth:
occaſioned by the ſubterraneous, ſalt-peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
moiſture and damps incloſed together,
with the Air, or wind, in the hollow pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the earth.</p>
            <p>Now when ſuch damps and moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures
grow ſo great, ſtrong, and thick,
by length of time, that they cannot
continue with the ſubterraneous Air a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer in one hole together: then
they do forcibly expell the ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Air from thence: which by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98081:28"/>
always giveth way to ſolid, and
thicker bodies: and then there is a kind
of civil conflict between them, which
of them ſhall give way, and depart
from thoſe hollow places in the earth: if
the earth then be poreous, ſandy, or
looſe, the incloſed Air and Wind gets
out thorough thoſe Pores or ſweating
holes, and is ſeen above the earth like
a ſmoaky Fogg or Miſt, as is touched
before in the laſt preceding chapter.
But if the earth be ſo hard, cloſe, and
tight, that the incloſed Damps and
Air, cannot by its thinneſſe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
penetrate, exhale, and force it
ſelfe thorough the pores and ſweating
holes of the earth: then it breaks tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the earth violently by its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
force and ſtrength: and thereby
cauſes the earth to ſhake, and quake,
until it can ſplit and burſt aſſunder in
ſome certain place, to give them
room.</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that ſuch Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
do ſeldom happen in thoſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98081:28"/>
countreys or places, where the earth
is porous, looſe, or ſandy: becauſe
there the incloſed air, damps, and moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures,
can eaſily penetrate, and force
themſelves through the earth, and
make their way without the ſhaking
or moving of the earth, which cannot
be where there is cloſe, tight, and ſolid
earth round about them.</p>
            <p>Now as touching the ſeveral kinds
and ſpecies of Earthquakes it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
truth, found by experience. That
all Earthquakes do not happen after
one and the ſame, but after divers kinds
and manners. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in <hi>libello de
mundo,</hi> reckons up, and deſcribes ſeven
ſorts of Earthquakes, each by its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
properties and faſhion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſtrength or weakneſs of the
ſubterraneous conteſt of Nature.</p>
            <p>1. Amongſt which, by ſome Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
whole Citys and Mountains,
with Houſes, and People, ſink quite
down into the earth: as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes,
<hi>lib. 2. cap. 48<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> That in <hi>Aſia,</hi> in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98081:29"/>
time of the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi>
there ſunk twelve great Citys,
and principal Towns, quite and clean
down in one night by an Earthquake.
<hi>Euſebius in Chronic. ad Annum Chriſti
33. Nicephorus lib. 1. cap.</hi> 14. do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that this was the great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
that hapned at the time of
Chriſts death, which was in the <hi>18th.</hi>
year of the Reign of the Emperour <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By ſome Earthquakes, the earth is
ſwoln, and heaved up high above its
natural ſhape and proportion, ſo that
great Mountains and Hills are
made there, where before it was plain
and even ground. <hi>Freeburgum Briſgojae</hi>
was deſtroyed by ſuch an Earthquake,
in the year 1509. And there are many
great Iſlands and places incompaſſed
with water, often thus made; for when
this kind of Earthquake happens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the waters, it heaves, and raiſeth
up the earth ſometimes, and in ſome
places ſo high, that it reaches up above
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98081:29"/>
the water, and there it remains, and in
time is changed, and comes to be an
inhabitable Iſland. It is Recorded
that the Iſland <hi>Delus, Rhodus, Alone,
Thera,</hi> and <hi>Theraſia</hi> &amp;c. came up ſo, and
alſo the Iſlands of <hi>Echinades,</hi> were ſo
lifted up out of the River <hi>Acheloo:</hi> and
certain others in <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Nilus,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth. <hi>lib. 2.
cap.</hi> 87.</p>
            <p>3. Some Earthquakes do raiſe and lift
up the earth very high above its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſhape: but aſſoon as the Earthquake
is paſt, it preſently ſinks and ſettles
down, and recovers its former natural
ſhape again, and doth not much hurt.</p>
            <p>4. By ſome Earthquakes the earth is
torn and divided aſſunder in a certain
place, ſo that there is a horrible great
<hi>Hiatus,</hi> or open hole made, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time; when ſuch a
<hi>Hiatus,</hi> rending, or opening of the
earth, ſwallowed up <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeditious
adverſarys: ſuch were <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi>
and <hi>Abiram:</hi> with certain other men
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98081:30"/>
of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 250 Princes of
the Aſſembly, famous in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and men of renown: with their
Houſes, Goods, and all the men that
appertained to <hi>Korah,</hi> ſunk alive down
into Hell, with all that they had, and
the earth cloſed upon them, they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
from amidſt the Congregation.
Concerning which, we may read in the
<hi>19 Chapter</hi> of <hi>Numbers, ver. 2, 31, 32,
33.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Some Earthquakes make the earth
to ſink lower down then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
and it never riſeth up again, but
remains always ſuch a low and ſunken
Land.</p>
            <p>6. In ſome places, eſpecially by the
Sea, and ſides of great Rivers and
Streams; the earth carries away Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Trees, Paſtures, and Meddows
into the Sea, and Rivers; and ſuch
particular Earthquakes do often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
here in <hi>Norway,</hi> chiefly in the <hi>South</hi>
parts thereof.</p>
            <p>7. In ſome places the Earthquake car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98081:30"/>
a great rumbling ſound and noiſe
along with it, like unto the noiſe of
Thunder; and ſo did this, that was
now amongſt us: for at firſt we knew
not otherwiſe, but it was Thunder,
before we ſaw the houſes and movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
apparently to totter and ſhake.</p>
            <p>1. Now where ſuch Earthquakes as
theſe do happen, there commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
ſtorms and tempeſtuous winds,
with an unuſual ſmell, which ariſeth
with the Earthquake out of the earth.
And ſuch an enſuing ſtorm we had
here, in, and about <hi>Chriſtiana,</hi> upon the
ſecond <hi>Whitſun-holyday,</hi> which was the
<hi>24th</hi> day after the Earthquake was
paſt, when we poor ſinners, (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Ackers Church,)</hi> were fain to get
out in all haſt, fearing leaſt the Church
ſhould have fallen down upon us: the
violence of which ſtorm or whirlwind,
continued about a quarter of an hour.</p>
            <p>2. And Earthquakes do uſe to cauſe
drought, and burning heat in the air,
which we alſo were aware of certain
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98081:31"/>
days and weeks time: to the no ſmall
dammage of the fruits of the earth.</p>
            <p>3. The Peſtilence alſo, and other poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
diſeaſes, do commonly follow
after great Earthquakes according as
the Air and Damps, which in ſuch
Earthquakes break out of the hollow
places of the Earth, was poyſoned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, and afterwards poyſons the Air
above the Earth, and doth naturally
produce pernicious and poyſonous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.
But God by his mighty power
can graciouſly divert all theſe things;
what otherwiſe uſually enſues after
Earthquakes, is ſhown in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chapter.</p>

            <p>Concerning thoſe Earthquakes which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98081:32"/>
are Recorded to have hapned before the
birth of Chriſt, I will not ſpeak at this
time, but only commemorate certain
of the moſt notable that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſince, and what enſued afterwards
in divers places.</p>
            <p>In the year of Chriſt 62. There was
a terrible Earthquake in <hi>Rome:</hi> and the
year following, that cruel Tyrant Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Nero,</hi> cauſed the City of <hi>Rome</hi>
to be ſet on fire, of purpoſe to have
burnt it quite down, thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
himſelfe with ſeeing after what
manner the lamentable deſtruction of
the ancient and famous Citie of <hi>Troy</hi>
was. And when the fire of the City
burnt with greateſt violence: he went
up to the higheſt Tower, or Terret of
his Pallace, and cauſed the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Troy</hi> to be plaid, upon ſeveral Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
inſtruments, and ſung before him;
that fire continued ſix days and ſeven
nights.</p>
            <p>In the year of Chriſt, 80. there was
a great Earthquake in <hi>Cypris,</hi> upon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98081:32"/>
which followed a great Plague, which
alſo reacht to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mightily. Thereupon enſued a great
and deſtructive warr againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi>
for <hi>Diurepaneus</hi> the King of the
<hi>Goths,</hi> advanced with the power of
<hi>Gothland</hi> over the River <hi>Danubius,</hi> and
held a bloody battle with <hi>Opius Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
General of the <hi>Romans,</hi> giving
him and his Army a total defeat, and
killing all, ſo that there ſcarcely eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
a man that could carry the <hi>Romans</hi>
any certain intelligence concerning
it.</p>
            <p>In the year of Chriſt 104. there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a terrible Earthquake in <hi>Syria,</hi> for
certain days together, whereby many
ſtately buildings were demoliſhed, and
many people were kill'd and deſtroy'd;
and it followed thereupon, that the
Emperour <hi>Trajanus</hi> fell into <hi>Armenia</hi>
with a great power, and vanquiſh'd it;
marched afterwards into <hi>Arbella,</hi> and
ſubdued the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and advanced
forward in ſuch a manner, as if he had
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98081:33"/>
purpoſed to have conquer'd the whole
World: having great fortune and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
at the firſt; but afterwards the
<hi>Jews</hi> rebelled againſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and would by no means be any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſubject to them: wherefore under
the conduct of <hi>Artemone</hi> their Leader,
killed and deſtroyed in <hi>Cyprus</hi> 240000
men, and ſlew all the <hi>Romans</hi> that they
could find or ſurprize every where.
And after this the Emperour <hi>Trajanus</hi>
raiſed a great and puiſſant Army, under
the command of <hi>Marcus Turbonus,</hi> and
<hi>Lucius Quietus:</hi> and ſent them into
<hi>Jewry,</hi> and the Countreys thereabouts,
which took and deſtroy'd all that came
before them: and did conquer and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
<hi>Hiberos, Sarmatia, Agarenos, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,
Boſphorum, Colchos,</hi> and alſo <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuciam,
Cteſiphont,</hi> and <hi>Babylon. Dion
Ammianus lib.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>And after the aforeſaid Earthquake,
the third general perſecution began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Chriſtians, under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Trajanus;</hi> ſome writers do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98081:33"/>
that it was as impoſſible to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the ſand in the Sea, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the number of thoſe that
were moſt miſerably Butcher'd and
Martyr'd in this perſecution, for the
confeſſion of the faith of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the year 111. when that wicked
Emperour lay in his Winter quarters
at <hi>Antioch:</hi> there hapned a terrible
Earthquake again: ſo that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Trajanus,</hi> cauſed himſelfe to be
carried out at a window, and remained
under the open Heavens, till the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
was paſt, not daring to truſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in any houſe, or under any roof,
for a long time after; and thereafter
followed ſuch a lamentable drought,
exceeding hot Air, miſ-growth of the
Fruits of the earth, Famine, and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
Peſtilence, and a loathſom
Stink from the earth: as if all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had conſpired and plotted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to revenge the blood of thoſe
multitudes of innocent Chriſtians, ſo
lamentably butcher'd and deſtroy'd by
that in humane Emperour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:98081:34"/>
In the year 151. there was much
harm done in many places of <hi>Italy</hi> by
Earthquakes, and thereupon enſued a
fearful Plague, which encreaſed ſo
mightily there, that it left many
Towns wholly deſolate; and terrible
inundations of Water did alſo ſpoyle
many fair Cities; and a multitude of
Graſhoppers devoured all the fruits of
the earth, almoſt all over <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 240. there hapned ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
terrible Earthquake in <hi>Italy:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
many Cities, and much people did
periſh by the opening of the earth;
whereupon there was appointed, <hi>(ex li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris
Sybillinis,)</hi> that general burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
ſhould be made to the Gods: not
only in <hi>Rome,</hi> but all over the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Empire; And thereafter followed that
very great &amp; deſtructive warr, between
the <hi>Perſians</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> on the one
hand, and the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> on the
other hand: to the great weakning and
ſpoyling of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>In the year 256. there ſunk down
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98081:34"/>
many fair buildings, people and all;
eſpecially in <hi>Italy:</hi> whereupon there
followed terrible diſtempers all over
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Empire, that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of it were full of warrs and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roars:
and there was ſuch a mighty
Plague at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Achaia,</hi> that
there dyed at <hi>Rome</hi> in one day 5000
people, all of the plague.</p>
            <p>And the year after, did ariſe the
Sect of the <hi>Samoſatenians,</hi> by <hi>Paul Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſatenus</hi>
a Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which
did much prevail, and cauſed very great
diſturbance in the Church of God</p>
            <p>In the year 345. there hapned a
deſtructive Earthquake, in, and about
<hi>Antioch:</hi> whereby many Towns were
ſpoiled and deſtroyed, and it continued
almoſt a whole year: ſometimes cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and preſently beginning again.
Thereupon followed a great warr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and
his Brother <hi>Conſtantem,</hi> for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Monarchy, wherein <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
was beaten, and overthrown by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Anquileja,</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98081:35"/>
and afterwards caſt into the
flood <hi>Alſa,</hi> where he had his burial.</p>
            <p>And after the ſame Earthquake, did
alſo happen fearful Schiſms and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in Religion: for the Emperour
<hi>Conſtantem,</hi> himſelfe turn'd <hi>Arian,</hi> and
cauſed an univerſal Synod to meet at
<hi>Laodicea:</hi> in which thoſe holy Fathers
of the Church, and Biſhops; namely,
<hi>Athanaſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Euſebius</hi> of
<hi>Vercelis, Dioniſius</hi> of <hi>Meiland, Hillari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
of <hi>Pictavia, Paulinus</hi> of <hi>Trier,</hi> and
many other Biſhops, and at laſt Pope
<hi>Julius</hi> himſelfe were depoſed from
their offices and places, and baniſht.</p>
            <p>And preſently after that, did the
<hi>Socinian</hi> Hereſie ariſe by <hi>Photinus Praeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterius
Sirmienſes,</hi> which filled the
Church of Chriſt with much trouble
and confuſion.</p>
            <p>About this, there was a great Synod
of Divines met at <hi>Sardis</hi> in <hi>Illyrico,</hi>
wherein were Aſſembled 376 Biſhops,
at which time the Church of Chriſt
was wretchedly diſtracted and divided;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98081:35"/>
for although 300 of the Biſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
conſtant to the true Chriſtian
faith and Religion: yet the 76 <hi>Eaſtern</hi>
Biſhops fell from it, and became <hi>Arians.</hi>
But the Sect of the <hi>Socinians</hi> was
condemned by both ſides.</p>
            <p>In the year 348, there hapned a
great Earthquake in <hi>Campania,</hi> and
<hi>Italy:</hi> whereby <hi>Dyrachium</hi> was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſtroyed, and <hi>Rome</hi> ſhook and
trembled for the ſpace of three days
and nights; In <hi>Campania</hi> were many
towns quite ſpoiled: &amp; thereupon there
followed again great diſtractions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances
both in Church and State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For the Emperour <hi>Conſtantem</hi> cauſed
two general Synods of Divines to be
Aſſembled, one in <hi>Armenia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
in which the Catholick Chriſtian faith
was confeſſed and maintained by more
then 400 Fathers of the Church, and
the other at <hi>Saleucia</hi> in <hi>Iſauria:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie, was by a hundred
and fifty Biſhops approved, juſtified,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98081:36"/>
and acknowledged for good. And in
the temporal ſtate, there followed a
long and deſtructive warr between the
Emperour <hi>Conſtantem</hi> and <hi>Magnentius,</hi>
with unſpeakable efuſion of bloud on
both ſides.</p>
            <p>In the year 366. there hapned ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Earthquakes all over the world;
the Sea broke through in divers places,
doing much harm; At <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
it Hailed ſuch great ſtones, that they
deſtroyed many People, and much
Cattle; <hi>Nicaee</hi> was wholly demolliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the very ground: the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
was fill'd with warrs and uproars
in all places. The High <hi>Dutch</hi> rob'd
and plunder'd in <hi>France: Sarmatae,</hi> that
is the <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites</hi> on the
one ſide, and <hi>Quadi,</hi> that is the <hi>Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
on the other ſide, invaded <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</hi>
The <hi>Saxons</hi> on the one ſide, and
the <hi>Scots</hi> on the other ſide, fell upon
<hi>England:</hi> the <hi>Goths</hi> did what they
liſted in <hi>Panonia,</hi> and overcame <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi>
and <hi>Thracia;</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98081:36"/>
and took <hi>Armenia:</hi> ſo that the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Empire was lamentably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyled:
and it proved Earthquake
ſufficient to the Inhabitants of thoſe
Countreys and Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>In the year of Chriſt 400. There
hapned a very great and dangerous
Earthquake in High <hi>Germany;</hi> and the
Heavens lookt like a burning flame for
divers days together. Thereupon it
followed, that King <hi>Snie</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
waged a deſtructive warr againſt King
<hi>Biorn</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in which warr he loſt
his own life; and the <hi>Lombards,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a great reſort of ſeveral other
Nations, marched out of the Countrey
of the <hi>Vandals</hi> 300000 ſtrong, over
the <hi>Rhine</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and plunder'd
it quite through; from thence they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
into <hi>Spain,</hi> where they did the
like, and continued there a long time.
The <hi>Hunnes</hi> alſo at that time, made an
unſpeakable warr upon the <hi>Romans:</hi> loſt
in one battle 125000 men, but ſlew
210000 of the <hi>Romans;</hi> ſhortly after
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98081:37"/>
this, they had another battle again,
wherein the <hi>Hunnes</hi> loſt 40000 men.</p>
            <p>In the year 406. there hapned ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Earthquakes in High <hi>Dutchland:</hi>
eſpecially by the River <hi>Rhine.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
King <hi>Rorick</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
High <hi>Dutchland</hi> the year following:
vanquiſhed, ſubdued, and poſſeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of the Countrey round about;
went over the River <hi>Rhine,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<hi>Mentz, Worms, Spire,</hi> and <hi>Trier:</hi>
ruin'd and deſtroyed all the adjacent
Towns: ſo that the Inhabitants, yea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
nature it ſelf ſeemed to be amazed,
and to tremble at his approach. For,
(which is ſtrange) when he came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the City of <hi>Metis,</hi> (that is <hi>Metz:)</hi>
and laid ſiege unto it; a great part of
the City walls fell down to the ground
by an Earthquake: ſo that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reſiſtance, or ſtriking a ſtroak, he
took the City.</p>
            <p>In the year 412. there hapned many
Earthquakes both in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi>
Whereupon enſued a great plague of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98081:37"/>
peſtilence in moſt Countreys; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
a moſt terrible famine and ſcarcity,
by means of the great miſ-growth of
the fruits of the earth. Alſo fearful
Tempeſts, Storms, and Hail, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Hailſtones weigh'd eight pound. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laricus,</hi>
the King of the <hi>Weſt Goths,</hi> fell
into <hi>Italy,</hi> and almoſt utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> purpoſed to have
deſtroyed <hi>Italy,</hi> and called <hi>Rome</hi> by
the name of <hi>Gothia.</hi> And after theſe
Earthquakes, did alſo ariſe the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
hereſie, by <hi>Pelagius,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick:
againſt which was holden an
univerſal Synod at <hi>Carthage,</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of 270 Biſhops: amongſt which
eſpecially was St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine;</hi>
alſo <hi>Attilla</hi> the King of the
<hi>Hunnes,</hi> began to tyrannize cruelly in
<hi>Europe,</hi> having great and wonderful
fortune and ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>In the year 488. there hapned great
and terrible Earthquakes in the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Empire, for a moneths time together:
whereby many Mountains, Caſtles, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98081:38"/>
Cities, were deſtroyed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
and many people periſhed.
And it enſued thereupon, that <hi>Odoacer</hi>
of <hi>Saxony,</hi> by open Hoſtility invaded
<hi>Italy,</hi> and was defeated three times by
King <hi>Diderick</hi> of <hi>Bern:</hi> ſo that he was
forced to flye for refuge to <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi>
and was beſieged there by the
<hi>Goths</hi> three years together.</p>
            <p>In the year 544. there hapned (as is
Recorded) ſeveral terrible Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
almoſt all over <hi>Europe:</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Italy.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it followed, that <hi>Totillas</hi> the
King of the <hi>Eaſt Goths,</hi> beſieged <hi>Rome</hi>
ſo ſtraightly, that the Inhabitants were
forced to eat Dogs and Cats for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Afterwards he took the City,
broke down the Walls, Fortreſſes, and
places of ſtrength, plundered, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
all that came before him, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
none, and ſet the City on fire:
ſo that for the ſpace of forty days, no
body could be there for fire and ſmoak.
Thus was <hi>Rome</hi> utterly deſtroyed by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98081:38"/>
the <hi>Goths,</hi> according to the prediction
of <hi>Scipio</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who had prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
it with tears 700 years before,
when the <hi>Romans</hi> burnt and deſtroyed
<hi>Carthage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two years after, the ſame King
<hi>Totillas,</hi> beſieged the City of <hi>Placentia,</hi>
ſo long, and hard, that the Inhabitants
were fain to eat one another, and at laſt
were forc't to ſurrender up the City to
him.</p>
            <p>In the year 591. there was ſuch a
dreadful Earthquake in <hi>Antioch,</hi> that
more then 60000 perſons periſhed
thereby; and thereupon followed an
extraordinary hot, and dry Summer;
after which, enſued a moſt fearful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and a plague: and the <hi>Lombards</hi>
with much blood-ſhed did reform the
old <hi>Lombards</hi> groſs Barbariſm to the
Chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>In the year 832. there was a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Earthquake in <hi>Italy,</hi> whereby cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Citys and Hills were quite ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up; Thereupon aroſe a deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98081:39"/>
warr, between the Emperour <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus
Pius,</hi> and his three Sonns, who
ſought by open warr, raiſed againſt
their Father, to deprive him of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
theſe three ſonns made a
League with <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> Pope of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who threatned to depoſe the
Emperour <hi>Lodowick.</hi> But the <hi>German</hi>
Biſhops ſtuck cloſe to the Emperour,
and ſaid that if the Pope came thither
to excommunicate, he ſhould depart
thence excommunicated. The year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
namely, 834. The Emperour <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowick</hi>
advanced with a great Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Alſatz,</hi> to reduce his ſeditious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
ſonns to obedience and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but was ſurprized in the battle of
<hi>Lugenfield</hi> by <hi>Baſell,</hi> and <hi>Lotharins.</hi>
whom <hi>Lodowick</hi> fully impowred to
mannage the Government, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with himſelfe, carried his Father
priſoner a long time about with him,
as a ſpectacle of wonder. At this the
Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,
and deſired his Sons, <hi>Lodowick</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:98081:39"/>
and <hi>Pipin,</hi> that they either by good
means, or by force, would procure
their Lord and Father's enlargement, if
they expected to find any faithful
friendſhip from the High <hi>Dutch,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Emperour was ſet at liberty
again.</p>
            <p>In the year 868. there was a great
Comet ſeen in the Air: after which
followed many Earthquakes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, a great plague: and there did
ariſe a terrible warr between the three
Brothers, the ſons of the Emperour
<hi>Lodowick,</hi> which of them ſhould get
and enjoy the Empire alone. The
<hi>Danes</hi> ſail'd over and invaded <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and there with ſword, fire, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
put all things into confuſion:
went afterwards into <hi>England,</hi> and
took <hi>Edmund</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi>
priſoner in a Church, drag'd him out,
and hang'd him up on a tree, and ſhot
his body full of Arrows, the <hi>20th</hi> day
of <hi>November</hi> in the year 870. as <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew
Westmonſter</hi> writes. And King
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98081:40"/>
               <hi>Harrald Haarfager</hi> waged a furious
warr in <hi>Norway,</hi> for the ſpace of ten
years; ſubdued, and expelled all the
petty Kings, and turned the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into a Monarchy, in the year 878.</p>
            <p>In the year 882. the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
there hapned a fearful. Earthquake
in <hi>Germany:</hi> whereby many fair hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and buildings in <hi>Worms</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
Thereupon it followed, that
the <hi>Normen</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Godfrid</hi> their King, marched
to the River <hi>Rhine,</hi> rob'd and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
all whereſoever they came, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſht
and deſtroyed to the very

and <hi>Gent:</hi> burnt up <hi>Lowen, Utrecht,
Lurich, Neus, Coln, Achen,</hi> and <hi>Gulich.</hi>
Whereupon the Emperour <hi>Carolus
Craſſus</hi> was ſent for cut of <hi>Italy,</hi> by
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Princes, to
defend his own Countrey againſt the
tyranny of the <hi>Normen;</hi> but he could
not prevail by force of Arms, and
therefore concluded a peace with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98081:40"/>
them, and delivered into their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
the Province of <hi>Newſtria</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> to be their own free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:
which is called by them
now at this day, <hi>Normandia,</hi> or <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 983. there was a moſt
terrible Earthquake in <hi>Italy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>Beneventura</hi> and <hi>Capua</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
Thereupon followed an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
drie Summer, and burning
drought, which occaſioned a great
ſcarcity, and a fearful plague.</p>
            <p>In the year 990. there hapned ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Earthquakes in many places: and
thereupon enſued fearful, and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inundations of water all over <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
upon which followed an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
hot and dry Summer, that burnt
up the fruits of the earth: which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
a great ſcarcity and famine eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

out of the Air; and in <hi>Albania,</hi> there
rained Corn from Heaven, but unfit
for the uſe of man. The Sunn was
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98081:41"/>
wholly Eclipſed, and a great piece of
fire fell down out of the Air, and burnt
upon the earth; after which, followed
a moſt terrible plague: ſo that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
which bare the dead (to their
graves) fell down dead themſelves, and
were buried together; and there came
much fire from the River of <hi>Rhine</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
by which many of the adjacent
Towns and Villages were wholly
burnt up.</p>
            <p>In the year 1085. there hapned a
fearful Earthquake in <hi>England:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
many houſes were overthrown, and
much harm done; and it followed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
that King <hi>William</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
cauſed all his Subjects annual Profits,
Eſtates, and Incomes, of every kind,
both of Corn-land, Medows, Woods,
Paſtures, Cattle, and Sheep, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing they had to live upon, to be
Regiſtred: and accordingly required
great contribution of the Countrey:
which cauſed danger ous civil tumults,
uproars, and diſcontents in the Land;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98081:41"/>
and there followed alſo a very unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
year.</p>
            <p>In the year 1085. there hapned a
terrible Earthquake in <hi>Lorain;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
there followed a fierce plague,
and ſuddain death of people. And the
ſame year, there was unſpeakable harm
done in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by great and
unuſual inundations of water, both to
people and Cattle.</p>
            <p>In the year 1126. there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
terrible Earthquake in <hi>Italy</hi> which
laſted 40 days. Thereupon followed a
lamentable miſ-growth of the fruits of
the earth, and a moſt miſerable famine,
as alſo a deſtructive and bloody warr
between the Emperour <hi>Lotharius,</hi> and
the <hi>German</hi> Princes: and between
the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and <hi>Conrad,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Frankenland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1135. there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
terrible Earthquakes heard of, both
in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Germany;</hi> whereby
many houſes were thrown down; the
fire alſo burnt fearfully out of the earth,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98081:42"/>
for certain days together, and could
not be quenched by water, nor by any
other kind of thing. And beſides that,
there was very great miſchief done in
many places of <hi>Germany</hi> by other fire:
<hi>Mentz</hi> and its Cathedral was burnt: in
the Cities of <hi>Spire,</hi> and <hi>Straſborg,</hi> many
Churches and Cloyſters were laid in
Aſhes: <hi>Auſburg</hi> was almoſt quite burnt
up, and a third part of <hi>Goſlar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hall</hi> in
<hi>Saxony,</hi> flew up into the air in a ſmoak:
and the next year following, there was
ſuch an extream hot, and dry Summer,
that the waters in great Rivers, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
and ſtreams, contrary to Nature,
did ſo diminiſh, that men might have
gone dry-ſhod over, where great Ships
uſed to ſail; the Wells and Springs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
became dried up in many places, that
many men fainted and dyed of thirſt, as
well as Cattle: yea many Buildings and
countrey Villages were ſet on fire by
the heat of the Sun, and it cauſed a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
famine in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1155. there fell many
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98081:42"/>
houſes down in <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
and thereafter followed a
great diſſention between
the Emperour <hi>Frederick
Babaroſa,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note, that this muſt doubtleſſe be by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</note> and the <hi>Pope</hi> of
<hi>Rome:</hi> which continued many years with
much efuſion of blood: until the

out of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
himſelfe to be publikely abſolved
in St. <hi>Marks Church</hi> in <hi>Venice;</hi> where
<hi>Pope Alexander</hi> was not therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
that the Emperour went bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg'd
to the Church, and there kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on his bare knees, with Prayer and
Faſting, for his offence committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him: but the Pope alſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
trode upon his neck with his

            <p>In the year 1194. there was a great
Earthquake in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereupon, that the <hi>Vandals</hi> fell
from the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Crown, forſook their
Chriſtian faith, and returned to the

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98081:43"/>
King <hi>Knute</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> raiſed all
the power of his Countrey, cauſed

the <hi>Fyeners</hi> 100, the <hi>Sealanders</hi> 120,
the men of <hi>Skone 150,</hi> in all 670 ſhips:
and therewith fell upon <hi>Knute,</hi> King of
the <hi>Vandals:</hi> who deſtroyed and kill'd
all that came before them, and carried
away much plunder of Goods and
Cattle out of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>In the year 1300. there hapned a
fearful Earthquake almoſt all over <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
thereupon followed an unuſual
dry Summer, with extraordinary heat:
ſo that in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the ſmall
Iſlands, men ſcarcely knew where to
find any freſh water in any place.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Italy</hi> there aroſe ſuch a

            <p>It will be needleſs to write any thing

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98081:43"/>
and what remarkable things
have always enſued; for from thoſe

do ſignifie and teach unto us.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>NOw when we enter into the
Sanctuary of God: that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Holy and infallible Word, and
there ſeek and enquire diligently for
right inſtructions concerning Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes:
then we ſhall receive this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
viz. That God did create the
world at firſt, that it ſhould be, and remain
fixt and unmoveable: <hi>concerning which,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98081:44"/>
the Scripture giveth this teſtimony.</hi>
1 Chron. 16. 30. Fear ye the Lord all
the earth, the world alſo ſhall be ſtable,
that it be not moved. <hi>And alſo</hi> Pſalm
89. 12. <hi>and</hi> 102. 25. In fundaſti ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,
Thou haſt laid the foundation of the
earth, and all that is in it. <hi>Alſo</hi> Pſalm.
104. 5. Who laid the foundations of the
earth, that it ſhould not be removed for
ever. <hi>Alſo</hi> Prov, 3. 19. The Lord by
wiſdom hath founded the earth. <hi>And</hi> Iſai.
48. 13. Mine hand alſo hath laid the
foundations of the earth.</p>
            <p>From whence, and other the like
Oracles of the wholly Scripture, we
may cleerly diſcern and underſtand,
that God did not create the earth ſo
looſe and unfixed in the beginning, that
it ſhould ſhake, tremble, and quake, but
always to remain ſteady, and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>But when the Earth, contrary to the
fixed nature of its Creation, ſhall trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
quake, and ſhake; then there muſt
certainly be ſome extraordinary and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98081:44"/>
important cauſes: of it whereof the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures more eſpecially intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
two; which moveth God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and produce ſuch great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Earthquakes; namely. Firſt, <hi>When
the wickedneſse of men is great upon the
earth, and the earth is corrupt, and filled
with violence, Gen.</hi> 6. 5, 11, 13. Then
is the Righteous and juſt wrath
of God provoked to move the
earth himſelfe, and cauſe her to
tremble, <hi>thereby to deſtroy men, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the earth it ſelf alſo. Gen. 6. 13. By
removing the Mountains, and they know
not, which he overturneth in his anger,
when he cauſeth the earth to be ſhaken out
of its place, that the pillars thereof do
tremble,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning which, the Holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
do give this further teſtimony,</hi>
Exod. 15. 12. when thou strechedſt out
thy right hand the earth ſwallowed them.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 7. The earth ſhook and trembled,
the foundations alſo of the Hills moved,
and were ſhaken, becauſe he was wroth. <hi>And
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98081:45"/>
Pſal.</hi> 104. 32. He beholdeth the earth
and it trembleth, he toucheth the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and they ſmoak. <hi>And concerning
ſuch Earthquakes, the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah
<hi>teacheth thus,</hi> Chap. 13. 13. The earth
ſhall be removed out of her place, by the
fury of the Lord of Hoſts, in the day of
his fierce anger. <hi>And</hi> chap. 24. 18, 19,
20. The foundations of the earth do ſhake,
the earth is utterly broken down, the earth
is clean diſſolved, the earth is moved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
the earth ſhall reel to and fro
like a drunken man. <hi>And Iſai.</hi> 29. 6.
Thou ſhalt be viſited of the Lord of Hoſts
with Thunder, and with Earthquakes,
and with great noiſe: with ſtorms and
tempeſts, and with the flame of a devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
fire. <hi>Alſo Nahum</hi> 1. 5, 6. The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
quake at him, the hills melt, and
the earth is burnt at his preſence, <hi>&amp;c.
Now where God in his wrath hath
thus ſhaken the earth, there her inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
might very well ſigh deeply,
and pray with</hi> David <hi>in Pſal.</hi> 60. 2. O
God thou haſt made the earth to tremble,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98081:45"/>
thou haſt broken it, heal the breaches
thereof, for it ſhaketh.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when God hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to do ſome extraordinary thing
upon the earth, or make any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
alteration in Countreys and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
the Holy Scriptures do teſtifie,
that it is made known by preceding
Earthquakes, as by ſo many <hi>prodomos</hi>
or Harbingers; As for example, when
God himſelfe deſcended down after an
eſpecial manner upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and
there gave his wholly Law to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
for the direction of themſelves,
and of the whole world, <hi>Then did the
whole Mount greatly quake,</hi> Exod. 19.
18.</p>
            <p>And when God brought his people
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (though <hi>Moſes</hi> hath not
recorded that any Earthquake hapned
then,) yet the Holy Scriptures do
ſhow, that it was not done without a
notable Earthquake: by which the red
Sea was divided in that place that the
children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went through, and

was ſo dry for the ſpace of about ſixty
miles, as the Tables of <hi>Coſmography</hi>
do ſhew, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
dry-ſhod, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 21, 22. As
<hi>Deborah</hi> the Propheteſſe and Judge,
and <hi>Barack</hi> the ſon of <hi>Abinoam</hi> the
Captain, do teſtifie concerning this in
their ſong of praiſe, <hi>Judg. 5. 4, 5. when
the Lord went out of Seir, and marched
out of the fields of Edom, the earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and the mountains melted from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord.</hi> And with this agreeth
that of <hi>Aſaph,</hi> one of King <hi>Davids</hi> chief
Muſitians, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 16, and 18. <hi>The
waters ſaw thee O God, the waters ſaw
thee and were afraid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the voice of
thy Thunder was in the Heavens: thy
Lightning lightned the world, the earth
trembled and ſhook.</hi> And that none
ſhould doubt that this hapned at the

<hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt. Aſaph</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
the aforeſaid <hi>Pſalm</hi> with theſe
words in the laſt verſe, <hi>Thou leddeſt thy
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98081:46"/>
people like a flock, by the hand of Moſes
and Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, when God would in an
eſpecial manner, appear unto that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
man of God, the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi>
upon mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> and there verbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſtruct him, what he in the Lords
behalf ſhould do in ſeveral Kingdoms;
Then there hapned a great Earthquake
before, but the Lord was not in the
Earthquake, as we may read in 1 <hi>Kin.</hi>
19. 11.</p>
            <p>It is alſo Recorded by the Prophet,
<hi>Amos,</hi> that there hapned in <hi>Jewry</hi> a
great Earthquake in the days of <hi>Uzzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
king of <hi>Judah,</hi> and of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the
ſon of <hi>Joaſh</hi> king of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi>
was called by God two years before
the ſaid Earthquake, from amongſt the
Heardſmen of <hi>Tekoa,</hi> to preach and
reprove ſharply the great and manifold
fins which did then abound in all the
Countreys thereabouts: as we may
read in the firſt chapter of <hi>Amos, ver. 2.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98081:47"/>
&amp;c.</hi> and in the following Chapters.</p>
            <p>And that this ſame Earthquake
was no ſmall one, we may ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtand by that prophetical
Doctrine, which the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi>
preached unto his Auditors certain
hundreds of years after: when he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the remnant of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
that were returned home from their 70
years <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, in mind:
and did then cauſe them plainly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that the ſaid Earthquake, was
a great, terrible, and dreadful one; for
the Prophet writes thus, <hi>Zac. 14. 5.
ye ſhall flee, like as ye fled from before the
Earthquake in the days of Uzziah King
of Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the new Teſtament, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
do the Holy Evangeliſts make
mention, concerning ſeveral Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
that hapned in thoſe times.</p>
            <p>The Evangeliſt St. <hi>Matthew</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi>
27. 51. and forward; writes, that at
the time of the death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98081:47"/>
the vail of the Temple was rent in twain
from the top to the bottom, and the earth
did quake, and the rocks rent, and the
graves opened:</hi> So that the Centurion,
and thoſe that were with him watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> when they ſaw the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
and thoſe things that were done,
feared greatly.</p>
            <p>By this Earthquake, doubtleſſe the
Lord for his part did ſhow his fierce
wrath againſt thoſe that had dealt ſo
unmercifully with his only beloved
ſon: and on the other ſide, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
did alſo ſhow his enemies, how
eaſily he could have cauſed the earth
in that Earthquake, to have opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, and ſuffered them altogether,
like the ſeditious <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and
<hi>Abiram,</hi> in former time, with all their
retinue, wives and children, to have
ſunk down alive into Hell, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.
But our moſt Gracious and patient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
was not come then to deſtroy,
but to redeem and deliver mankind
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98081:48"/>
from the wrath and righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God <hi>Luk</hi> 9. 56. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not one <hi>Jew</hi> of the enemies of
Chriſt periſhed in this Earthquake, but
the long ſuffering of God did hereby
yet ſeek to draw them to repentance,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>Alſo at the time of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt his Reſurrection: there hapned
a great Earthquake again, concerning
which, the above named Evangeliſt
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> writeth thus, <hi>chap. 28.
2, 4. Behold there was a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>and the keepers did ſhake, and
became as dead men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning this Earthquake, Divines
a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of ſeveral opinions: for ſome think
that this Earthquake hapned, <hi>ſub de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſu
Chriſti ad inferos,</hi> when Chriſt
deſcended into Hell, or to the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
or innermoſt parts of the earth,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, <hi>Eph,</hi> 4. 9. And then
preſently did a mighty great conflict
begin, between the Prince of darkneſs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98081:48"/>
(the <hi>Devil)</hi> on the one ſide, that
would have preſerved his Pallace, and
kept what he had in peace, <hi>Luk</hi> 11. 21.
And the Prince of life, and Lord of
Glory, the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> on the
other ſide, that is called a ſtronger
then he, that came upon him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him, <hi>Luk</hi> 11. 22. And by this
great and powerful conflict, Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
mankind, <hi>and took away the
power from him that had the power over
death, (that is the Devil) and delivered
them, who through fear of death, were all
there life time ſubject to bondage, Heb.</hi>
2. 14. 15. wherein the Devil with all
the powers of Hell, ſtrived mightily
to oppoſe him, but Chriſt gets the
victory at laſt, <hi>having ſpoiled the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities
and powers, he made a ſhew of
them openly, triumphing over them in it.</hi>
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes, <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 2. 15. and that
according to his own propheſie by the
Prophet <hi>Hoſea, chap.</hi> 13. 14. where he
in time of old ſpeaketh thus, <hi>O death I
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98081:49"/>
will be thy plagues, O grave I will be
thy deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now at ſuch a mighty conteſt, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in hell, or the innermoſt parts of
the earth: could not the earth contein
it ſelf, but was forced thereby to ſhake,
tremble, and quake, ſo that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt
might well ſay: <hi>Lo there was a
great Earthquake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning this,</hi> Luther <hi>writes thus.</hi>
Annotante D. Johanne Gerhardo Homil.
Sacr. parte 2. ſuper Feria, paſch.
1 Concione 3. in hoc terrae motu, Chriſtus
ad inferos deſcendit, Satanam ligavit,
captivam duxit captivitatem, infernum
deſtruxit, claves abstulit, morti praedam,
eripuit, &amp;c. <hi>That is, in this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
Chriſt deſcended into Hell,
bound Satan, took captivity captive,
ſpoyled hell, and carried away the keys,
and took away the prey of death from
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other Divines, eſpecially thoſe
that are preachers, are of this opinion;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98081:49"/>
that this Earthquake hapned at the
time of Chriſts Reſurrection, which
was upon <hi>Eaſter-day</hi> in the morning;
thereby ſhewing, that as the earth at
the time of Chriſts death, did quake
and tremble in compaſſion of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pain, and innocent death of its
Lord and Creator; ſo by a particular
great Earthquake, ſhe did now rejoyce
again at his Reſurrection: and
did leap and dance, for joy of the
victory and conqueſt obtained by Jeſus
Chriſt: and as it were with both hands
(to ſpeak after the faſhion of men) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
her Lord and Creator from her,
which now ſhe had incloſed in her to
the third day.</p>
            <p>Each of theſe Divines opinions do I
allow to be worthy and Godly: foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as neither of them do in the leaſt
oppoſe the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But beſides this, the Evangeliſt St.
<hi>Luke</hi> Recordeth, that when <hi>Peter</hi> had
preached that excellent Sermon in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:98081:50"/>
in the great feſtival of <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide,</hi>
concerning the death of Chriſt
on the one ſide, and his glorious and
victorious Reſurrection from the dead
on the other: and then by the ſame
Sermon converted about 5000 men to
the faith and confeſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi>
4. 4. After the ſame Sermon, with the
unanimous, and earneſt prayers, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
and thankſgiving of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
were ended; it is mentioned in the
31 verſe of the afore named Chapter,
<hi>that the place was ſhaken wherein they
were aſſembled together, and they were all
filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and ſpake the
word with boldneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And again, when</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas
were caſt into priſon in Philippi, the chief
City of that part of Macedonia Act. 16.
12. <hi>and they then in the priſon prayed
and ſang praiſes to God,</hi> there was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
a great Earthquake, ſo that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the priſon were ſhaken, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
all the doors were opened, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98081:50"/>
every ones bands were looſned. <hi>ibid.</hi> ver.
26. <hi>ſo that the Keeper and all his houſe
were thereby converted to the faith of
Chriſt, and were baptized,</hi> ver. 33.
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>I will not now ſpeak concerning
what the Evangeliſt St. <hi>John</hi> Records
in his Book of the <hi>Revelations, chap.</hi>
6. 12. 8. 5. 11. 13, 19. and 16. 18.
Becauſe generally Divines, and the
faithful Teachers of the Chriſtian
Church do expound thoſe things Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorically:
and do underſtand thereby,
the great and terrible perſecutions and
efuſion of blood, which the Church of
Chriſt hath partly ſuffered, now lyeth
under, &amp; hereafter ſhall ſuffer by means
of divers Heretiques, falſe Teachers,
and Tyrants which will aſſiſt them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of the world: from
whom the Lord in mercy preſerve
theſe Countreys and Kingdoms for
Jeſus Chriſt his ſake.</p>
            <p>But that moſt ſerious propheſie
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98081:51"/>
which Jeſus Chriſt the foundation and
mouth of Truth, as a true Prophet,
did propheſie and leave unto his
Church, concerning ſuch Earthquakes
as ſhould really happen before his laſt
Glorious appearance, ought by no
means to be here forgotten or omitted.
And Chriſt himſelfe hath propheſied
concerning Earthquakes toward the
end of the world, after this manner,
<hi>Mat. 24. 7. and there ſhall be famines,
and peſtilences and Earthquakes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
places.</hi> And <hi>Mar 13. 8. there ſhall
be Earthquakes in divers places, famines
and troubles.</hi> Alſo <hi>Luk 21. 11. And great
Earthquakes ſhall be in divers places, and
famizes, and peſtilences, and fearful
ſights, and great ſigns, ſhall there be from
Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence it may be concluded,
that when God Almighty now in theſe
laſt times of the world, doth permit
ſuch great and ſpacious Earthquakes,
ſo many miles in length to happen;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98081:51"/>
men ought not lightly and careleſly to
ſlight them, and think no more of
them: but to regard and receive them,
as ſignifying partly, ſome certain new,
and unuſual accident impending, or
approaching. And partly as the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<hi>prodomos,</hi> or forerunners of the
laſt day: yea, <hi>and the creatures earneſt
expectation that waiteth for the glorious
manifeſtation of the ſons of God; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as the creature is made ſubject
to vanity againſt its will. And the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
groaneth, and travaileth in pain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with our ſelves to be delivered
from the bondage of corruption,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi>
teacheth, <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. 19, 20, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now therefore mark attentively,
and conſider well with thy ſelfe, O
thou intelligent Reader: that if the
ſenceleſſe and dead creatures, ſuch as
Earth, Rocks, Seas, Iſlands, and the
like; that have neither mouth nor
tongue, brain, nor heart, can ſo quake
and tremble: yea, as it were, bewaile
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98081:52"/>
and condole themſelves, when their
Lord and Creator is angry, or intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to viſit Countreys and Kingdoms,
with any uncouth or ſtrange thing; how
much more ought the hearts of men
whilſt they live, and in time too: to be
amazed, and to tremble and quake for
fear of the wrath of God, and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
judgements.</p>
            <p>And if ſo be they will not do it now
in the time of Grace, then may we
juſtly cry out, and complain upon them,
with that Holy and reverend Father
of the Church Saint <hi>Ambroſe. O homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
pectora Saxis duriora.</hi> Oh thou
heart of man, that art harder, and more
inſenſible than the Rocks and Stones:
for they can quake, but the heart of
man not; yea then we may well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
with the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, chap.
5. 3. Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they
have not grieved, thou hast conſumed
them, but they have refuſed to receive
correction: they have made their faces
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98081:52"/>
harder then a Rock, they have refuſed to
return.</hi> And alſo with the Prophet
<hi>Zachary</hi> in <hi>chap. 7. 12. Yea, they have
made their hearts as and Adamant ſtone,
therefore came a great wrath from the
Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O man, man! conſider now well
with thy ſelfe in time, that if thou
canſt not now be moved to tremble
and quake for that God, that can ſo
move the earth, and cauſe her to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and quake: then thou maiſt juſtly
fear, that when the Lord Almighty
will ſo move the earth, <hi>that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe,
and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent
heat, the earth alſo, and the works that
are therein ſhall be burnt up, 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 10.
that it will be then too late for thee to
tremble and quake.</p>
            <p>And if any now may be moved to
great fear and amazement by theſe
ſmall Earthquakes, which do no very
great harm; what kind of anguiſh and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98081:53"/>
terrour thinkeſt thou, will at that time
fall upon all ungodly and incorrigible
men, that here would never fear ſuch
a God?</p>
            <p>Truly then the Kings of the earth, and
the rich men, and the chief Captains,
and the mighty men, and every bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and every free-man, ſhall hide
themſelves in the Denns and in the Rocks
of the mountains: and ſay to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Rocks, fall on us, and hide us
from the face of him that ſitteth on the
Throne, and from the wrath of the
Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is
come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</p>
            <p>Oh Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Suſpirium</note> thou Rock of
Salvation, and precious corner-ſtone of
Zion, do thou mollifie our hard and ſtony
hearts, and according to thy promiſe,
give us hearts of fleſh, Ezek. 36. 26.
<hi>That we may now in the time of
Grace, be amazed and tremble at our
bloudy ſins, and their well deſerved
and impendent puniſhment, that ſo the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98081:53"/>
puniſhment may be either graciouſly
mittigated, or wholly diverted, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thy Divine will, for thy great
mercies ſake,</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>Now he that can give any better, or more
perfect inſtruction or information, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Earthquakes, and yet will not do
it: committeth a great ſin, inaſmuch as
he concealeth ſuch wonderful works of the
Lord.</p>
