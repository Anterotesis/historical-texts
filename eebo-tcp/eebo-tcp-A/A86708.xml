            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Can hardly ſatisfie my ſelfe, and thee much leſſe, who doſt wonder to finde me in Print, My comming forth into this open light, who have rejoyced in my cloſe retyredneſſe; is, as if the Batt ſhould ſtare the Sun in the face, at noon day. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thee to know, that, as the ſervice fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly upon me by Lot, ſo the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance no leſſe unexpectedly ingageth me, to
<pb facs="tcp:114939:3"/>
be thus publicke: I was not a little tempted, to decline the employment, and even ready to ſay in ſome diſcouraging Conſiderations, O my Lord, ſend I pray thee, by the hand of him, whom thou wilt ſend: And ſee, how my Experience juſtifieth my Fears; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is come to me, of one (an unknowne Hearer) who hardly refrained himſelfe in the Congregation, from clamouring againſt me, as a Preacher of falſe Doctrine: Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents will bite the heels; I am in this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what concerned, to ſubmit to common cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure what was delivered; let the falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be pointed at, I deſire no mercy, and ſhall juſtifie every ſyllable: The adventure was (in my owne apprehenſion) great, while (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that time of his greateſt perill, when the Ship was falne into a place, where two Seas met) ſo was I ingaged, betweene oppoſite Parties, which I was to ſpeake unto; the rigid Punctilio-men, both of the right hand, and of the left; unto whom, to ſpeake of any thing tending to Moderation, is the ſame thing, as to bring ſeverall ſwelling
<pb facs="tcp:114939:3"/>
mountaines together, to grow into one even ground: But, as they do not finde me ſo for Communion with diſſenting Brethren, as to buy it upon the unfit termes of yeelding up my owne ſure Principles; ſo I wiſh them to ſit downe, and calmely conſider, whether (as Chriſtians) we are not bound to make all faire offers for it we may, and to lay downe all our Animoſities, of which the Miſcheif is ſo ſadly viſible.</p>
            <p>Now, that I may be ſure not to diſappoint thee, I promiſe little i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this Sermon, but the Subject, the extraordinary occaſion, the Orthodoxy, the plaine, open Honeſty, and Zeale, without intemperate heat: If thou finde ſomething, which may be of good uſe, and (for the temper) proper and ſeaſonable (as ſome would perſwade me) I repent not my well meant few dayes labour, moſt glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would I beſtow, and bee beſtowed, If in the leaſt I may be profitable.</p>
            <p>I never cared (as all who have known me, can witneſſe) to wrap up, and hood my ſelf, as ſhy of diſcovering what I am, and now it
<pb facs="tcp:114939:4"/>
will appear, I am no Changeling, though one, who would ſacrifice himſelfe for the Unity or Gods Church.</p>
            <p>I would give thee a little further advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For that Generation of men, who are haters of Miniſters <hi>Toto genere,</hi> who are for a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, nothing leſſe then utter extirpation of us; and who, if they were Baſilisks (as they are Serpents) would look us dead; Theſe I do either roughly treat, or ſlightingly paſſe by: Diſingenuity, is th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

As for the other ſort, who face us, and with the muſtered Forces of their pretended Gifts, do invade our Pulpits, and pull away the Cuſhion from us: We ſtand and admire not them, but the infinite patience of God, who plucketh not his right hand out of his boſome, to conſume, ſuch uncommiſſioned underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; He judge between them, and us (whom he hath been pleaſed to ſeperate, and call neer unto himſelf) Whether their taking our Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and holding forth, be upon any warrant, or no; I am ſure it will be hard for them to
<pb facs="tcp:114939:4"/>
plead, what We can. I am vvilling to ſuppoſe thee a ſober Well-wiſher to a fixed Miniſtry, and I hope, one who doſt ſolicite God, in thy Prayers, for us who are beſet with ſo many, and thoſe unreaſonable Adverſaries; In lieu of thoſe Prayers, take our bleſſing with thee, that God would give thee ſuch Wiſdome, as is moſt needfull to guide, and direct thee, in the worſt, and moſt perilous times, that thou mayeſt ſteer an even, ſafe courſe, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of making Ship-wrack of thy Faith and good Conſcience, till thou arrive in thy wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Haven, <hi>In ſinu Abrahae,</hi> out of all the ſtill new threatning Stormes, of this tempeſtuous evill World.</p>

(as they thought) ſhould be Common: <hi>Corah</hi> the Ring-leader, gets many Complices to ſecond him, no leſſe then two hundred and fifty Captains of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they together, take ſtomack, roundly to tell their Leaders, that they took too much upon them, that they acknowledged no ſuch difference to be made between them and others: If they were annointed, yet the people alſo had an Unction of Holineſſe, and would allow no ſuch diſcrimination, as their arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance made: Thus early did the humour of ſtriving with the Prieſt begin, that we may not wonder at it now; no ſmall diſcouragement was this to <hi>Aaron,</hi> eſpecially, when he conſidered who they were that maligned him, even of his own Tribe, of <hi>Levi,</hi> for ſo I find them to have been, aſſociated with ſome <hi>Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> indeed the <hi>Levites</hi> did riſe againſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the <hi>Reubenites</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Quarrel grew hot, and the Iſſue was eaſily foreſeen to be the worſt confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reaſoning the matter with unreaſonable men, would not compoſe and end it, ſome extraordinary Expedient was neceſſary to ſtop the Train, before it went far: It was time for <hi>Moſes</hi> to conſult God, yea, for God alſo, to lay to his hand, to ariſe and ſhew himſelf, when thus his Prieſthood was invaded; and ſuch an Iſſue is deviſed, to which the matter ſhould be put, as the Mutiniers could not but confeſs juſt &amp; reaſonable, and ſhould find moſt convictive of their Inſolency, Cenſers to be taken by both, and ſo the Controverſie to be decided from Heaven, by a Glory reſting upon that part, which God ſhould owne, ſo it was. But the conviction of ſuch Wretches, was not enough, <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> It
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114939:7"/>

            <p>What then are the more remarkable things of the Story?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod budds, conſider the ſeveral Rods, when layd up, they were all alike, one as little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing as another, the Characters as fairly written, of the names of the reſt, as of <hi>Aarons,</hi> and yet behold, as viſible a difference appears between them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a living, growing, Fruitfull Branch, and a bundle of dry ſear ſticks: Do we look into nature for a reaſon of this, that was quite non-pluſt: It could not work beyond the Sphear of its activity, and did as much forbid one Rod to flouriſh, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Can a Ruſh grow without Mire?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 11. Iohn 5.</note> 
               <hi>A Branch that is cut off grow, except it abide in the Vine?</hi> In the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall impoſibility of this, lies the ſtrength of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Argument, and Application.</p>
            <p>But we eaſily over-look nature in this, that God, who at firſt made all things to have a being out of nothing, could well make this Rod to budd, without earth, Or moiſture, or other helps, and advantages: It is not now ſo ingenious to ask, <hi>How could this thing be?</hi> As why? and that is as eaſily anſwered; All <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> were repreſentatively in theſe twelve Rods, and it was neceſſary, a difference ſhould be made, the other twelve Princes ſtanding in competition, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves as well qualified for the Prieſthood,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114939:8"/>
as he who was inveſted with it; Now ſurely thoſe Princes believed the Prieſthood to be the greateſt honour, who made this the height of their emulous ambition, and were in good hopes they ſhould have carried it, they would not elſe have had their names put into this Divine Lottery, written in ſeverall Rods. And neceſſary it was in that juncture of time, that ſome one Rod ſhould keep life in it ſelf, and how vainly ſhould they be Competitors any longer, againſt whom God did thus manifeſtly appear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod doth not only bud, but bloſſome, putting forth it ſelf, and giving proof of its germina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Nature is ſlow, and leaſurely in its producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the moſt lively branches which continue in the Tree, cannot make Buds and Bloſſomes at once, how much leſſe a twig cut off from the ſap that nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; We muſt therfore conclude, <hi>the finger of God was here,</hi> there was ſomething more then ordinary in <hi>Aarons</hi> Bloſſoming Rod: It was of an <hi>Almond</hi> Tree, according to that in the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi> Viſion, <hi>I ſee the Rod of an Almond Tree;</hi>

this? Here I would give a hint to our ſuddainly gifted and illuminated Bretheren, if they would be pleaſed to take it; Though <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod did bud and bloſſome in a night, his Qualifications for his Office did not come ſo ſuddenly, both his inward acquired and not infuſed Abilities,<note place="margin">Exod. 29.35.</note> and his outward Calling and ſolemn Annointing and Conſecration <hi>for ſeven daies together,</hi> do all ſhew, too much haſt may be made into the Prieſthood: And what can I ſay to thoſe Novices, againſt whoſe admittance the Apoſtle entred his Caveat, who will needs be in <hi>Aarons Office</hi> before their Buds be come forth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, did not onely bloom Bloſſoms, but alſo yeilded Almonds, not onely gave hopes, and promiſes, and Earneſt of Fruit, but the fruit expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and that not overhaſtned, but kindly, and come to due maturation: This was the height of the wonder, Buds, Bloſſomes, ripe Fruits, and all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo little a time, as a night; who ſees not in theſe ſeverall productions, both ſatisfaction given, to that preſent age, in the Fruit, a ſure proofe of <hi>Aarons</hi> Calling to the Prieſthood, and ſecurity given to Poſterity, for conſtant ſucceſſion, in the Buds and Bloſſoms, which did tell what fruit ſhould come in after times, from the ſame Stock. Of theſe Almonds much good uſe may be made, many wayes; we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves now with this; There is no ſuch good, and ſure proofe, of the calling of God, as Fruitfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>Some more weak and ſcrupulous ſheep of Chriſts Flock, do ſtand looking upon their Paſtor, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion his Calling, to take the care of them when

they ſhould be feeding; they ſcruple whether their Miniſters be lawfully called to the overſight of them, though never ſo duly ordained, when they might find it by their owne Improvement; let that ſcruple ceaſe: If with right Ordination (and the continued practice of the Church determines what that is) there be fruitfulneſſe in their Miniſtry, if there be on their part laboriouſneſſe, watchfulneſſe, deſire to approve themſelves to the conſciences of men, endeavour to gaine ſoules unto God; if they be Doctrinall men (as Doctor <hi>Donns</hi> word was) <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And in this will we make our free appeals to God, to judge between us, the legally ordained Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and whoſoever our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers; If we have not fruit to ſhew of our Callings, which Gifted pretenders ſhall vainely boaſt of, if there be not, in all places where we have been ſetled, ſome ſeals of our Miniſtry, <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Commendation</hi> of it to be produced; if men have not thrived happily, under our labours, and been fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Heaven, if Chriſts Kingdom be not more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by us, then it can be by any of thoſe Invaders of our Miniſtry, then let Heaven and Earth be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt us, let us be razed out of the land of the living; yea, we may boldly make the impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Let the earth do by us, as it did by <hi>Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> even ſwallow us up quick.</p>

not ſo, they were kindly, and laſting, by this good token, That for perpetuall memory, both the Rod and Fruit, were kept in the Arke of God: And in this (if it be fit to make compariſons between them) ſaith a Reverend Auther; This Rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> had the pre-eminence above that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though that did very great Miracles, yet the wonders which it did, paſſed away: But this carried ſtill the Miracle in it ſelf, and ſo was a moſt precious Relique: And that the Fruit ſhould continue upon it, and that be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Ark, was alſo moſt neceſſary, for a ſigne of the perpetually ſucceſſion of the Prieſthood.</p>
            <p>By the way, If we had then lived, and ſhould have ſeen the Ark rifled, the Buds, Bloſſoms, and Almonds (all the good Ornaments of the Rod) pluckt off, and the Rod it ſelf broken, would we not have ſhaked our heads at it?
