            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The First imbattalling then of a Company of 200:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The First Imbattaling of</hi> 200.</note> men is to draw them into a forme or kind of Square Body, according to the forme of this figure following.</p>

                  <head>The First Forme of Imbattalling of two hundred men.</head>
               </figure>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:2794:12"/>This Battayll you see allmost drawne to a Square by reason of the distance, for it is to be supposed, that now this body standeth at order in Files, which is three foote; and at open order in Rankes, which is Sixe foote: and so by extending the length the file is made as large as the front; and of all Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes this is the strongest and the best, being ablest to bring most hands to fight without disorder and the soonest repaired and amended whensoeuer it shall come to any ruine, for now it standeth ready for all motions what soeuer.</p>
               <p>There is an other manner of Imbattailing of this number, when they shall encounter with a Troope of Horse, the order and proportion whereof is Contained in this figure following:</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:2794:13"/>Here in this Bataile you see how the ranks of Shott are drawne within the Ranks of Pikes and so couered and safeguarded that the Horsemen cannot charge or breake vpon, or through them, but with most eminent and certaine danger, for the vollyes lie rrady prepard, and the Pykes stand so that they cannot be enforced to any rout or disorder; And here you shall take a principall obseruation; that if the horse which shall charge this Battell of foote be Gentlemen at Armes, Armed <hi>Cap a pe:</hi> from head to foote; with strong <hi>Launces</hi> in their hands and <hi>Pistolls</hi> at the Saddle bow; and the Horse Armed also both with defensiue &amp; offensiue Armor, then shall all the Pikes charge at the right foote and draw their swords ouer arme, euery man with his former foote linking in his leaders hinder foote; But if the Horse be but <hi>Curashieirs</hi> Armed from the head to knee, with long Pystols and vnarmed Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, then shall all the Pykes charge aboue hand, and not at the right foote, and shall also aduance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in their charge and offer to encounter with the Horse, for their strength is such that it cannot be broken by vnarmed Horses, nor can they be ruin'd but by the vtter losse of the Horse Troope,</p>
               <p>Now for the manner of the Salley of this inclosed Shotte, and how they shall giue their volley, to the most anoiance of the enemy, you shall perceiue it in the forme of this next figure following.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:2794:14"/>Heere you see that in this Salley or giuing of the volly against the horse, one halfe of the Musquets (vpon the first appearance or approch of the Troope and before they come within distance to deliuer their pistols) Issueth fourth by the flanke, which by wheele or otherwise, by turning of faces you shall euer make the front, and being aduanced some small distance they presently spread foorth themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one single file, and so deliuer their volly alltogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whilst the other haulfe of the Shotte ascend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their places, and make ready, then that parte of the Shot which did Issue foorth, and haue giuen their volly, shall with all conuenient speede retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues againe betwene the rankes, and Passe behind the Shot which filleth their roomes and there lade thire Musquets againe; whilest the Pikes charge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the right foote, or alloft according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Horse Troope which chargeth them; then the Horse wheeling about to recouer the second Pistoll the other halfe of the Shotte shall Issue out and deliuer their volly as the former.</p>
               <p>Now if the Horse Troope shall happen to deuide it selfe and so charge the foote Battell on both sides, or if they shall range themselues and charge euery way, both before, behind, and on both sides, then shall the Shotte Issue out both wayes and girdle the Battaille round about, according to the forme and fashion of this figure following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:2794:14"/>

                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:2794:15"/>Thus you see the Shotte issueth fourth equally on on both sides, and girdleth the foote Battalia round about, so that the volly is giuen entirely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impeachment or trouble one of another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to shoote ouer one anothers Shoulder or by making the First man kneele, the Second stoope, the Third bend his body, the Fourth leane forward, and the Fifte to stand vpright, and so to deliuer their volly were both rude and disorderly, bringing great danger to the Souldier, and placing them in such a lame and vncomely <hi>Posture,</hi> that all Agillity and aptnesse to doe seruice would be taken away and the enemy taking aduantage thereof would be much more ready and apte to breake in vpon them and driue them to rout and confusion.</p>
               <p>There is an other forme of Imbattaling this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of 200 men, and it is excellent either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst foote or Horse, &amp; hath so many seuerall waies to fight, and that with such strength and safety, that on which hand soeuer the Battaile shall be assailed, yet it will stand impregnable, the Shot so seconding the Pikes, and the Pikes so garding the Shot that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way it will giue a certaine and Infallibe repulse vnto the enemy. This Battaile is a square Battaile as the rest before shewed; yet it is compounded of diuers squares or Maniples, which amongst the best experienced Souldiers is held the best and safest way of fighting, the forme of which Battaile is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this figure following.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:2794:16"/>Heere you see eight seuerall squares brought into one square, and the ninth reserued voyd for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement of the <hi>Ensigne,</hi> &amp; such short weapons as shall attend it, which howsoeuer they be out of vse, in the Low-Countries, where groose Bodies, seldome or neuer Ioyne, yet with vs, where hand Battaile must continually be expected, they are not vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, nor to be neglected. This forme of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile carrieth the front euery way, and vpon the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the face, is ready to receiue the charge foure seuerall wayes at once, with equall strength and oppositions; for euery square is a seuerall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuple, and one so answering to another that nothing but multitudes can subdue it.</p>
               <p>There is againe another forme of Imbattailling these 200: men, which howsoeuer it carry an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary face of weaknesse, yet it is strong and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall, and was indeede inuented through the false shew, to draw and bring the enemy on, who being once ingadged, in the open and weake places, the Maniples or small squares, at an instant retire, and Ioyne them selues togeather so strongly, that it is impossible for the enemy to come off without great losse or vtter subuersion.</p>
               <p>This Battaile (as the former) is compounded of nine squares fullfilled and supplied, and of sixe emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vnsupplied, which may draw on, and intice the enemy to charge; but afterward by closing and Ioining together, frustrateth that hope, and leaues the euent to the hazard of fortune.</p>
               <p>The forme of this politike and deceiuing Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile is expressd in this figure following.</p>
               <p>

                     <head>The Politique, or deceiuing Battaile.</head>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>Heere you see that though these empty places in the Battaile are reserued, whereby to entice the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; yet they are so slanked on either hand and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, both with Pikes and Shotte, that no approach
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2794:17"/>
can be made without danger: no if the Horse should attempt to charge and breake in, thinking to cut the Shot from the Pikes as in outward shew it seemeth likely; yet haue the Shotte such safe and seuerall places to retire into, and the Pikes standing so apt and ready to couer and entertaine them, that the assault is to no purpose, and the Battaile standeth still stronger and stronger.</p>
               <p>The difference betwixt this Battaile and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is only the breach and seperation of Manuples, which being aduanced one from another (yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the distance of guard) haue more liberty to fight, and may alter their proportions, or distances, as they please.</p>
               <p>There is another forme of imbattailing these 200 men, and it is principally vsed against the Horse, especially, when they charge in the forme of a wedge, or Triangular, of which wedge I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more largely in the former part of this Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and this Battaile also is drawne from a maine square, onely the weapons are altered, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Pikes are made strongest in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Battaile; This Battaile was of greate vse amongst the <hi>Grecians</hi> before fire or powder was knowne, and many famous votaries, and Triumphs gotten by the vse thereof, and therefore hauing now fire and Shotte to assist the naturall strength thereof, it must needes be more acceptable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier of imitation.</p>
               <p>This Battaile is drawne by diuision betweene the Middle men to the front, and the Middlemen to the reare, and betweene the Middle men to the right flanke, and the Middle men to the left, leauing the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2794:17"/>
Shotte within the Pikes, in such manner, that vpon all assaults they may haue free vse of their Armes; and yet notwithstanding abide in safety in dispight of the enemy.</p>
               <p>The forme of this Battaile is expressed in the next figure following.</p>
               <figure>
                  <head>The Battaile to withstand the wedge of Horse.</head>
               </figure>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:2794:18"/>Thus you see how this Bataile is interlined with the Shot, &amp; guarded with the Pikes, so that although there be a field of entrance, yet it is a straight place of much danger; and howsoeuer the enemy may come on bouldly, yet he cannot but returne hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily.</p>
               <p>Many other sorts of imbatialing there are, though none more necessary, as the battaile called <hi>Diamond,</hi> the Battaile <hi>Triangular,</hi> and such like; which Nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (I know) is desirous to search into; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions I know at the first, carry a greate shew of much skill, and counning, especially to the ignorant, but being once waded into with Iudgement, there is nothing more facile or easie: therefore to draw a <hi>Diamond</hi> Battaile, first drawe your battaile into a square, according to the first figure in this booke; or for your better remembrance, according to this figure following which being but compounded of 144 men; may serue to expresse the manner and fashioning of 4000.</p>

               <p>Heere you behould the square or forme of a Battalia, now to reduce this to a <hi>Diamond,</hi> or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect square, the <hi>Captaine</hi> shall come to the leader of the right hand file, (which is the first and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall man of the company) and aduancing before him, shall wheele the whole company into a direct line, with the right point foreward, and the left point descending, as in this figure following.</p>

                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>Heere you see that by drawing foorth of the Battaile, howsoeuer square at the first, yet by alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of distance, it is brought into a perfect <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> forme; and although the Pikes and Shotte keepe their places, as in the square, yet at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you may change them, and draw the weapons to what part of the Battaile, and into what files your selfe pleaseth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:2794:19"/>Now to bring this <hi>Diamond</hi> or any other <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> into a perfect Triangular: you shall cut off the <hi>Diamond</hi> Battaile in the Middest, through the two midle extreame parts, and then will remaine vnto you two Triangulars, a greater and a lesse, which you may double or encrease, as you shall finde occasion; so that albeit by this diuision you find how to make this proportion, yet perceiueing how you may double and encrease both the files and rankes, (whose number is euer constant and certaine, according to the proportion of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle) you may at pleasure without any diuision or seperation of body, forme this Triangle, out of the files and rankes onely. But because you shall not stand amazed at this businesse, I will in a few Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, containe but a fewe men (which is the easiest for capasity) shew you how to bring a <hi>Diamond</hi> to a Triangle, as in this figure following appeareth.</p>
               <figure>
                  <head>A Diamond Battaile brought into a Triangle.</head>

               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:2794:20"/>Thus you see the <hi>Diamond</hi> is cut into two Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles which being ledde seuerall wayes may serue as two Bodies, and that to exceeding good, and honorable purpose, for this <hi>Diamond,</hi> or sharpe pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing body, is of great force to enter and breake any square body, and being but entered in with the point, the rest of the body followeth with such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and strength, and so encreaseth and maketh the Breach greater, and greater, that the square body can hardly ioyne together againe, but falleth into rout, or into a retrait that is full as dishonorable, and to this purpose was this <hi>Diamond</hi> foote battaile first of all inuented.</p>
               <p>There is againe another manner of imbattailing this priuate company of 200, which howsoeuer it be seldome or neuer vsed in fight, yet it is of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vse in the field, both before the framing of the battaile, &amp; after the battell is framed, this manner of imbatailing, is when either any of the <hi>Captaines</hi> offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers would deliuer a priuate message to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which none but themselues should heare, or when the <hi>Captaine</hi> himselfe, would either giue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret directions, or imparte matter of instruction, or matter of reprehension, or when any other su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame officer of the field, would deliuer to the company either encouragement or caution.</p>
               <p>The manner of this imbattailing is in this wise, the <hi>Captaine</hi> shall first cause both the wings of Shot to stand still, hauing drawne them vp into their close order, then he shall aduance the first diuision of Pikes vpward, till the midle men of the Pikes to the reare be equall with the two first ranks of Shotte, and euery man in his close order, then
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2794:20"/>
shall the Subdiuision turne their faces about and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend downeward, till the middle men of the front be equall with the two last rankes of Shot, then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing closed all strongly together, and turned euery face vpon the Center: The <hi>Captaine, Lieutenant, Ensigne,</hi> and such other Officers, as he will haue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his speech, shall come into the square void place of the Battaile, and there deliuer what seemeth good to himselfe; which finished, he shall reduce his Battaile backe into its first forme, as for the shape of Imbattelling for <hi>Parley,</hi> it will carry the proportion of this Figure following.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:2794:21"/>There be others which Imbattaile for speech or Parly much after this manner aforesaid, onely they straighten or make lesse the empty or void place in the midst, by making the Shotte first to double their ranks, then the first diuision of Pikes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance vpward, and the subdiuision of Pikes to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend downeward, and afterward to doe in all things as before, and then the forme of battaile will bee like this figure following.</p>

that the best and safest way of fight is by small Manuples, for they are with least difficulty gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made the longest to indure fight without disorder.</p>
               <p>They are the soonest reduced to their first forme when they are put into route, and the Shotte and Piks being thus intermixt one with another, the one offending, the other defending, the battaile is of great force, and more terrible to the enemy. Lastely, in a battaile thus compounded, euery man hath the order or gouernement of his owne Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who are trained to his discipline, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his commands, by which they are made more willing to goe on, and doe obay with greater Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and allacrity, then when they are lead by a stranger, as in the other battell perforce they must be; these and many other like reasons, the younger Souldiers yeeld to make good this new opinion, and I must confesse they carry a greete shew of substantiall truth, did not some impediment crosse in the way, which take from them a great parte of beleefe and credit, for to these Reasons, thus the old Souldiers reply.</p>

                     <hi>The old Soldiers reasons for their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                  </note> this forme of imbattailing is good and may passe for courant, as long as companies are in their full strength, and hold their perfect and true number, but to that the warre is a knowne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and who knowes not that sicknesse, mortality, slaughter, ill diet and lodging, hunger, cold and surfeites doe so attend vpon Armies, that by them commpanies are exceedingly weakned and made lesse, so that he which mustereth one hundred men if he bring three score and ten able men into the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2794:28"/>
field to fight, is oft held for a stronge company, and so in like case of other numbers, so that to imbattaile these by themselues, being of so small contents, neither can the volly be greate, nor the harme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous which shall insue to the enemy, whereas the seuerall weapons of these small bodies, being drawne out and knitte into seuerall great bodies, the numbees will swell and increase, and as of vnits are made infinits, so forty of my Shotte ioined to forty of an other mans, and to vs sixe-score of two or three other <hi>Captaines,</hi> will make 200 Shotte, this will bring foorth a great volly, and this will proue of great danger to the enemy.</p>
               <p>Againe for the easinesse of gouernement, or spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reducing them to their first forme, being routed, they haue no aduantage of this other great body, for howsoeuer the Shotte is in two bodies, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther former mixt battaile is in sixteene, &amp; the Piks in one body as the other is in eight, yet are these great bodies diuided into so small diuisions, and ledde by such sufficient officers, that no disorder can happen, but it is as soone brought againe into forme, as if they had their owne Commanders, and one of the great vollies will doe more hurt and spoile, then foure of the smaller.</p>
               <p>Lastly for the Imagination of more ready obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, better vnderstanding of command, and a greater willingnesse to discharge duty, the old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers suppose they are no necessary obstacles to be thrust in into this place, because the discipline of warre being (as it ought to be) all of one forme and manner, without intrusion of new words of command, or addition of curious nouelties, so that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2794:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
euery officer speaking a knowne and a certaine language, it matters not who giues the word, for being vnderstoode it must be performed, and that they will fight more willingly with their owne <hi>Captaines</hi> then with other men, the naturall alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance they beare to their king and Country, whose quarrell they fight, puts all such doubts out of question, because euery honest and valiant mans conscience is ruled by the iustnesse of his cause, and his Kings commandment, and all other heats are supernaturall, and but the proofes of false vallonre.</p>
               <p>Thus the old Souldier answereth to what the young Souldier doth obiect,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
                  </note> and for a conclusion addeth this more, to withstand this new manner of imbattailing. They say that this mixing of Shotte and Pikes together in seuerall distinct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, weakneth and disableth the grosse body; for here if you cast off your shott, then you leaue such emptie and wide streetes, that the enemies Horse are apt to breake in and disorder them, or if you doe not cast off the Shott, but keepe them close, and make them discharge in Countermarch (which is the best and safest way) yet then they are apt to be thronged vp together by the Pikes, and the distance of place being taken from them, the vse of their Weapons must fall, and so consequently all things fall to ruine.</p>
               <p>But suppose order be kept and these defects not found in the Battaile, yet say the olde Souldiers, that there is great impediment in this kinde of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battelling; for in what manner soeuer the Short serue, yet they will euer leaue a weakenesse in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2794:29"/>
and such open gaps and streets that the Horse may breake in at pleasure, or any other new foote diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may sally foorth and ouer throw the whole regiment, as by the example of the figure follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may easily be perceiued in a few companies, as in this ensuing figure more plainely is showne.</p>

It resteth now that I deliuer my particular opinion touching the best election; wherein, although I know, many opo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites will rise vp against me, yet freely and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously thus I am perswaded.</p>
               <p>That the first manner of Imbattelling by seuerall Companies,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The former difference reconciled</hi>
                  </note> and euery Captaine leading of his own men, is excellent for shew at generall Musters, or at any peaceful Triumph, where the exercise of Armes is required, because it is comly and beautifull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, giueth great contentment to the spectators, and continueth the Volley long, though not in the best order. But if it be to expresse true Marshall Discipline, to bring hands to fight in good sadnes, or to giue affright to a certaine enemy at all times both in strength and weaknesse, then with out all doubt the latter forme of imbattailing where the Pikes are drawne into one body, and winged on each hand with the Shotte, is without all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the onely best way for the Imbattailing of a regiment of one thousand men or more.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the argument of Imbattailing a regiment, wherein if any man rest vnsatisfied, let him repaire to other Authors which are allowed for authority, and comparing their Reasons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no doubt but he shall soone finde satisfaction.</p>

               <head>Chap: 5. The forming of maine Battailes of any extent or Number how great soeuer.</head>
               <p>AFter the ioining of Regiments togeather, must necessarily follow the composition of maine Battailes, beyond which Spheare Souldiers doe neuer looke, because it is the end and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of warre,</p>
               <p>These battailes (as I haue formerly shewed) are euer shaped according to the ground whereon they are planted,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obseruation in shaping of battailes.</hi>
                  </note> and according to the naturall deffences, or naturall offences which arise from the same places: yet because particulars often growe from generalities, and that from plaine and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounds curious and rare things are deriued. I thinke it not amisse heere in this place to deliuer you some generall and plaine moddels of battailes, which taken into a Souldier-like consideration, may giue you an aide, though not an instruction, how to accomodate battailes and to forme and proporrion them in such manner as may bee most commodious for your selfe, and friends, and most hurtfull and noisome for the enemy.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes and the members</hi>
                  </note>First then you must vnderstand that the body of euery maine Battaile is compounded of sixe principiall Members, that is to say, of the <hi>Forlorne</hi> or loose bodies, of the <hi>Vantguard, Battaile, Reare, Horse,</hi> and the great <hi>Artillery</hi>; and of these, if any be imperfect, or out of frame, either in order, number, shape or Gouernment, the whole Army is sicke, and howsoeuer like <hi>Xerxes</hi> host they may make the skie darke with their Arrowes, yet will an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of <hi>Cirus</hi> men, well disciplin'd, put them to route, and write Captiuity on their backs as a perpetuall embleme.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>How to finde a square Roote.</hi>
                  </note>When therefore you will drawe vp any maine battaile, you must looke into the square Roote of greate Numbers, as the square Roote of one hundred is ten, because the body carrieth ten in square euery way, for ten times ten is one hundred, so likewise the square Roote of 400 is 200, because it carrieth the square of 200 euery way, for twenty times twenty is foure hundred, and thus of any number which will carry a square proportion be it great or little whatsoeuer;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deuiding of a Battaile.</hi>
                  </note> then knowing the entire Number of the whole Army, and diuiding it into seuerall parts, alowing so many for the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorns,</hi> so many for the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> so many for the Battell, so many for the Reare, and so many for the guard of the Ordnance, or great Artillery; you by the drawing vp of these lesser squares, and inlargen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as occasion shall serue, forme and shape euery seuerall diuision after what proportion your selfe pleaseth, for of squares, you may make Rounds; of Rounds, Triangles; of Triangles, Diamonds; and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2794:34"/>
of Diamonds many other curious or intricate figures that shall come into your imagination, for proofe behold this figure following.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Thus you see by deuiding and mixing of squares,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lornes.</hi>
                  </note> you may frame other proportions, it resteth then that after you haue cast out, and alotted your <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorns</hi> which is intended euer to be the least of all the foure Battailes, that you distribute them in this manner: the first point of the <hi>Forlorne</hi> ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of certaine loose files of Shotte extrauagantly dispersed without order, then to second them with certaine small squares of Shotte as an 100 or 200 in a square well ordered and gouerned which as the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2794:35"/>
Battailes shall approach nearer and nearer, may vpon any occasion of danger retire into the <hi>Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard.</hi>
                  </note>Then shall the <hi>Vantguard</hi> be compounded of one maine and entire body, or of two at the most; containing almost, but not fully three parts of the Battaile, and being equally mixt of Shot and Pikes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the battel</hi>
                  </note>After the Vantguard, the maine Battaile taketh place, being compounded of one body or two at most, and containing a full third part, or sometimes more then halfe as much againe as the <hi>Vantguard.</hi> In this battaile ought to be the choisest men and best experienced of the Army, it is the seate and place of the <hi>Generall,</hi> and as an Ocean sendeth foorth his streames of Souldiers to releiue and refresh euery weake and distressed part that is about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the Reare</hi>
                  </note>Next after the Battaile is the place of the Reare which likewise is contained in one body or two at the most. This body ought to be of equall number and extent with the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> and in all Formes, Marches, and Executions it is one and the same in Nature with the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> for at any time when faces are turned about then is the Reare the <hi>Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurad,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Vantguard</hi> the Reare; at the two points of the <hi>Vantgurad,</hi> that is to say, the vtmost right point and the vtmost left point, as two long exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded wings, troopeth the Horse Army,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Horse battaile and the great Ordnance with the guard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
                  </note> and at the end of them is the great Ordnance on both sides; behind which marcheth two Regiments of foote for a guard and defence of the Artillery and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the cutting off of the greate Ordnance is the renownedst worke the enemy can aime at, or accomplish.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:2794:35"/>Thus I haue in words deliuered you the true forme of a plaine and ordinary battaile, with euery seuerall member belonging there vnto, but for as much as the protraicture maketh a deeper impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the minde, and is a greater helpe and friend to the memory then the meere relation of words onely; I will therefore in this next figure follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, shew you the true portraiture of the battaile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready discribed.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:2794:36"/>Thus heere you see the strongest of Battailes, and as curious as any what soeuer, so that to make a conclusion of this worke, who will diligently looke into these models already demonstrated, and apply himselfe to the imitation thereof, shall not neede to lodge any scruples in his brest, but by the helpe of these examples may be able to range any battaile with Iudgement and sufficiency. And thus much for the forming of maine Battailes of any extent or Number how great soeuer.</p>
