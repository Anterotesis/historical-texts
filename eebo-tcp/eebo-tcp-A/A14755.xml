         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Looke what perfection a

with a spreading increase of their
lustre and heate. Looke what such
an Eccho as the seuen fold porch
of <hi>Thebes</hi> is to the sound of a
Trumpet, such is Thankefulnesse
to the Benefactor. And therefore
in reference to Parents is the
summe of pietie; to Equals, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
and humanitie; to God, of
Religion: yea, the very prime and
summe of all Vertues and Duties,

when hee hath to doe with
God, the Maker, Searcher, and
Iudge of the Spirits, who in these
kindes of Offerings loues the fat,<note place="margin">Leuit. 3.</note>
and the inwards: the deeper and
hollower the belly of the Lute or

voyce which is made in the mouth

The very <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the
principall and totall of our thanks
with God, is as <hi>Bernard</hi> ends his
Epistles and Counsels to one that

first worke is of the vnderstanding
to iudge of the worth of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite,
to consider the vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the receiuer, to studie a
<hi>Quid retribuam.</hi> A foole cannot,
and a proud man wil not be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
the first, because hee cannot
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20122:11"/>
estimate and weigh in the ballance
of Iudgement, the value of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
conferred vpon him, or
through melancholly conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
will not see what God hath
done for them. The second be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee conceiues it no more, if
not lesse then his due and desert,
which is the reason that an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
ouerweening the strength of
his naturalls, or the merit of his
works, cannot be thankfull; which
taught <hi>Prosper</hi> wittily and wisely
to entitle his Poems <hi>Contra ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos,</hi>
without further naming the
aduersaries of Gods grace. A rash
man cannot bee thankfull, who for
a fit onely and brunt, sends vp an
extemporary <hi>God bee thanked,</hi>
whereas he ought fixedly, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to studie and deuise how
hee might cast most honour vpon
his good God for his bountie to
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:20122:11"/>
The second care must be had of
the Memory, that a deepe impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
bee made, frequent refreshing
and refrication bee vsed with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
watchword, <hi>My soule, forget
not all his benefits;</hi> which made him
write downe his passions, and giue
his Psalmes the title of <hi>Record,</hi> or
<hi>Remembrance.</hi> Obliuion is so farre
from excusing, that it selfe is the
worst kinde of Ingratitude, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all hopes of future thankes,
and arguing a slight esteeme of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
past, which so soone haue
set them behind backe, and out of
sight, in some blind corner of the
mind. Our Memory is a naturall
mother to iniuries, a stepmother
to benefits, for the helpe whereof
our gratefull forefathers were
wont to erect Pillars and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
stampe Coines, giue names
to Places, dedicate Dayes, and
keepe anniuersary Feastes, that so
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20122:12"/>
they might preserue a <hi>Vestall</hi> fire
in their breasts, and not serue God
with a flash of ioy and blaze of
thankes. A third worke is the
warmth of the affections, which
if dead and cold, how can any
fumes of <hi>Incense</hi> ascend? Excesse
of ioy and gladnesse is in stead of
thanks, which the neerer it comes
to a rapture and extasie (such an
one as <hi>Peter</hi> was in, when he wot
not what hee said; or the <hi>Iewes</hi>
comming out of captiuitie, faring
as one in a dreame) the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it is vnto God, though it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it selfe in abrupt and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
passions and gestures, such as
<hi>Dauids</hi> dauncing vnseemely in
foolish <hi>Micholls,</hi> but most comely
and kingly in Gods eies.</p>
            <p>These actes of the soule are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
all that God requires, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
the best fountaine and spring
of thankes, which sets the price
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20122:12"/>
vpon the Offring; and makes the
Turtle of the poore as welcome
as the Oxe of the rich, the Cruse
and Mite of the Widdow more
worth then the Riuers of Oyle
and treasures of the wicked.</p>
            <p>All this is but intrinsicall and
immanent thankes; but Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
are too great for one mans
heart to comprehend or requite:
and therefore hee will not haue
them die in the breast of one man,
and lye buried in silent admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but requires a transitiue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and publication of them.
How many aydes and witnesses
doth <hi>Dauid</hi> summon to assist him
in this worke, the Mountaines to
leape, the Flouds to make a noise,
the Hils to clap ther hands: and
which of his musicall Instruments
doth hee not call vpon? Sundry
helpes and signes of thankefulnesse
hath Nature and Art found out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20122:13"/>
and vsed; ringing of bells, display<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
of banners, pompe and feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
lights and fires, which while
some condemne, they come neere
his fault that asked, <hi>What meaneth
this wast?</hi> yet are all these but a
poore and sencelesse kinde of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
performed by reasonlesse De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties,
if the thankes determine
and end in these without more sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
expression. Cheere of
the countenance, gestures of the
body, leaping and dauncing are
but dumbe shewes, the best In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretour
of the minde is the
tongue, the glory of man, and
glorifier of God. <hi>My tongue shall
tell of thy wondrous actes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my
lips shall neuer cease to publish thy
praise.</hi> This was all the fee Christ
expected for his cures, <hi>Goe and tell
what God hath done for thee:</hi> words
seeme to bee a poore and sleight
recompence. But Christ (saith
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20122:13"/>
               <hi>Nazianzene</hi>) call'd himselfe the
<hi>Word,</hi> and good words comming
from a good heart are of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
and force with God and
man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> enuied the Birdes that
might in their kinds sing Gods
praise in his Courts, and in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of them, who set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
on the highest tops of Trees
whence their notes may bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
heard, he laboured to spread
Gods prayses in the greatest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
in <hi>Sauls</hi> Court, in all
Companies hee came in, in the
Temple it selfe. By speech one
mans heart conueies into another
the cheerely conceptions and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of his soule, and so multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
praise, and sets others on
worke to blesse God wit him, &amp;
the more the merrier, &amp; the more
mirth the more thankes; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the flocke, the cheerelier noise;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20122:14"/>
the fuller the Quire, the lowder
the Musicke, and one cheerely
Bird often sets all the flock a chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;
one man showts, and the
whole Hoste followes. <hi>Iohn</hi> heard
a voyce from the Throne, saying,
Praise yee our God, all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
small and great; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
a noyse as of many waters,
and mightie Thunderings, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Hallelu-iah,</hi> for the Almightie
reigneth.</p>
            <p>Yet because speech is transient,
and of life for the present onely,
the Pennes and writings of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men haue beene of singular
vse to transmit and conuey vnto
Posteritie the noble Acts of God:
one generation teaching another
to keepe like praises in store, that
Gods thankes may bee immortall
in Succession, and Propagation.
Such fruite may our Statute haue
in after ages, penned for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20122:14"/>
of Gods inualuable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance
from that Hellish-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plott,
were it as duely read as
it was prouidently enacted.</p>
            <p>When we haue giuen God good
words,<note place="margin">Gregorius mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium vltimo, e 12.</note> it remaines that wee giue
him not words alone,<note place="margin">Per victimas caro aliena, per obedientiam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria voluntas mactatur.</note> but our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
obedience, preferred by God
to all our sacrifices: slay not our
beasts, but our beastly lusts; giue
him not our goods, but our selues;
not any dead, but a liuing and
reasonable sacrifice. Hee that in
way of thankefulnesse vowes and
performes the mortification of
one dareling sinne, the addition of
one good dutie, pleaseth God bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then <hi>Salomon</hi> with his twentie
thousand Beeues and Sheepe.
Would wee know then how wee
should perfect our thankes, walke
wee with God, let vs doe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
abound in Almes and
Prayer; better our Pietie and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20122:15"/>
Charitie, increase the workes of
our callings, bring foorth more
fruit in our kindes: for with such
sacrifices God is most honoured
and best pleased. The Auncient
and wonted thankes after victories
&amp; blessings, were reformation of
vices, remouall of Idols, sanctions
and executions of good Lawes,
release of debts, bounty to the

Wee haue heard that a thankefull

Logicke, that hath for his obiect

There bee fauours Priuatiue, and

            <p>Were it hot now superfluous to
say, to whom this thankes ought
to bee giuen? To whom but to
him of whom we haue all things?
Yet wee had rather change the
name, and shift the debt to any

euents to Nature, Destiny, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20122:20"/>
Fortune,<note place="margin">Vide Senec. lib. 3.</note> rather then to the liuing

is best tryed, not extorted
from vs by our owne necessities, as

drawne by shame or penaltie from
vs, but voluntary, and therefore
best testifying vs to bee of Gods
willing people: which grace,
where he giues, surely he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
more of all kindes. For where
doe men delight to sowe, but in

most? Where doe Musitions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

but where the <hi>Eccho</hi> multiplies
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most in their returne? But our
profit is too sordid a motiue for
this liberall vertue. Thanks is not
thanks, if bribing and eying future
fauour, if any thing more then
the praise of past bountie, though
there should neuer bee need or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of any more afterwards.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20122:24"/>
But our dulnesse hath need of all
spurres. <hi>Dauid</hi> the Nightingale
of Israel sets many a thorne to his

A grateful Courtier desires but to
know what the will and pleasure
of his Soueraigne is: and this is
enough, and aboue all other bonds
to a man sensible of the benefits of
Creation and Redemption. What
else is the difference and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence

sleights or neglects, vndoes and
dissolues the whole bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
not of Humanitie alone,
but of all Christianitie. God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring
all that wee can doe with
other respect or end, bidding the
proud man and his merits perish,
done in way of desert or pay, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accepting that which is done in
the name of Christ, in way of
thankfulnesse for him and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
who is the Altar which sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
and graceth the gold and the
gift to the hornes whereof it is
best binding with the cordes of
thankes all our offerings: who is
the great Master of Requests, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a golden Viall ready to offer
vp, and commend to his Father all
the Incense of his Saints, and to
giue a sweete odour and perfume
vnto them, making the least Cup
of water tendered in his name of
precious account, without which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20122:25"/>
all is abominable: And therefore
hee that would set a speciall glosse
vpon his sacrifice of thankes, let
him with the acknowledgement
of his vilenesse (as <hi>Dauid, Who am
I and my people?</hi>) craue acceptance
in his name, in whom God is well
pleased: for <hi>this is his will in Christ
Iesus our Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Thankes</hi> in <hi>Thesi</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
is Gods will, it is now out of
question: but there is yet another
clause in my Text, <hi>Towards you,</hi>
which bidds vs search, what is
Gods will in <hi>Hypothesi,</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
Towards vs: euen to vswards
of this Nation, this Assembly, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thee and mee, all and euery
one of vs ioyntly and seuerally.
First, it is requisite that wee take
good notice of our Receipts, and
then balance them well with our
Returnes; and so shall wee see our
Arrerages best, and what remaines
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20122:26"/>
for vs to doe. Marke we aduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what our owne Writers, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Poets vsually applaud in our
Nation; how they extoll our Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
our Soyle, our natiue Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
our Policies, Lawes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Peace, Plentie, Prosperitie,
terming vs <hi>Albion, quasi Olbion; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli,
quasi Angeli.</hi> Can too much in
truth bee spoken to the praise of
Gods bountie, and blot of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude?
How hath he lifted vs
vp to Heauen, seuered this Iland
with the seas of his mercies from
all the world besides, and borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
kingdomes round about, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it as a Queene in the middest
of them, to heare newes of warres,
pestilence, bloodshed, and desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
not to feele the least distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
from within or without,
scarce to heare a dog barke against
it's long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued peace, vnmatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in present or past examples.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20122:26"/>
Aboue all, what a golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
hath he placed in it, furnished
with oyle and lampes, I would I
could say in euery shaft and pipe of
it; but so as I may well resemble it
to a bright skie in a cleare euening
sparkling with Starres, though not
in euery part, yet in euery Zone and
quarter of it. What times can tell
of the like light, learning, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
knowledge? Oh that I could
say practise and thankfulnesse an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable.
What an hedge or wall
of fire and protection hath God
made about vs? what glorious sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations
from forreigne inuasions,<note place="margin">1588.</note>
from domesticall treasons,<note place="margin">1605.</note> such as
wilscarse be credible to after ages.<note place="margin">Factum est hoe à Domino miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fico in consilijs, magnifico in o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peribus, &amp; est mirabile in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis nostris.</note>
Was <hi>Israel</hi> it selfe euer honoured
with more? To all these, when for
a while of late we were in a damp
of griefe &amp; feare in the absence of
our <hi>Prince</hi> for a season, how sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
hath hee blowne ouer that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20122:27"/>
cloud? how speedily and happily
hath he returned him, that we fare
as people in a dreame, can scarse
tell how to beleeue our selues, or
how to expresse our ioyes enough;
how hath he filled our hearts with
gladnesse! Oh that I may bee able
truly to say, our tongus with praise,
and our liues with duties. In this
fresh &amp; last fauour of his, he deales
mee thinkes with vs as Creditors
with slow Debtors, where they
haue aduentured much, they will
sometimes shoot another arrow in
hope to finde and make good their
former losses; as <hi>Seneca</hi> counsells
his <hi>Ebutius</hi> to imitate the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who neuer leaues husbanding
and manuring the barren ground,
till he make it fertil, to heape bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
on benefit, till hee awaken his
vnthankfull friend, ouercome him
with kindnesse, and in the end by
some welcome good turne excite
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20122:27"/>
his dulnesse, and extort thankes by
that for all the former from him.
I would I were as sure God should
speed of his end, as I am sure this is
his end, to put vs to the blush for
our former ingratitude, to winne
vs at length to pay our debts and
vowes vnto him. Some, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
of all sorts great and meane he
hath, I doubt not, among vs, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
obseruers and receiuers of his
blessings. like a few berries after
the shaking of a tree, which makes
him forbeare to lay the Axe to the
root for a while: but the common
thankes which hee reapes at the
hand of the multitude, is luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnesse
and Newtralitie at the
best; in many lingrings after Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and idolatry; in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
sort, desperate swearing, disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
sabbath keeping, brutish drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes,
and vncleannesse, falshood
in dealings till all burst againe, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20122:28"/>
in fashion following, without
shame or modesty. These are the
dregs of our times, &amp; blots of our
feasts, which if not amended, may
not a withdraught of all Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
a remoouall of his Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick,
the worst of all plagues, be as
certainly foreseen, and foretold, as
if Visions and Letters were sent vs
from heauen, as to the 7. Churches
of <hi>Asia?</hi> But I hope better things of
our better sort, and loue as little as
may be to haue mine eye &amp; finger
vpon these sores, wishing we might
see such a Book-fire as wee read of
<hi>Act.</hi> 17. made of all our clandestine
Libels, seditious &amp; male contented
Pamphlets. I speak not against the
pretious balme of reproofe, no not
oyle of Scorpions: let the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
smite vs with plain &amp; faithfull
rebukes, and such smitings shal not
wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the body, or break the head,
but shewe vs our defects without
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20122:28"/>
rancor and malice, powring in no
poyson and venome, but oyle and
wine to heale our wounds, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
vs to thankfulnes worthy the
blessings heaped &amp; renewed daily
vpon vs; and what is the best tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks,
but nationall and personal amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life? and what thankes is
enough, what Hecatombs of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
are sufficient for a God that
hath done so much for vs, and yet
ceaseth not to doe vs good? I
would know of the most ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
man what he can require of vs
more then he hath richly &amp; abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danly
deserued, were it to halfe,
yea to all the wealth of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
I take not vpon me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
particulars. But suppose he
should exact of vs this particular,
which I dare say would highly
please him, and would I am sure
bee a most worthy and needfull
fruit of our gratitude to him. I will
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20122:29"/>
not mention a Ceremoniall, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiall,
superfluous matter of
forme and order, but a necessary
substantiall amendes of what all
confesse to be amisse: a prouision
I mean, of a sufficient maintenance
and Minister in euery Parish of the
Kingdome, a righting of what Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
hath wronged, a Restitution
of what Religion first consecrated,
Superstition misplaced, couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
wholly alienated and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated.
This could not in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
but prooue a cure of all the
maladies spirituall and temporall,
a dispelling of our Egyptian fogs,
a dispersing of the Frogs that yet
remaine as thornes in our sides, a
quickening to all good workes of
pietie and charity, a goad and spur
to all kinds &amp; fruits of thankfulnes
that God can require of vs. Haue
I spoken of more then he requires,
or we need, or of that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible?
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20122:29"/>
the last will be the onely
plea, but withall the plea onely of
our ingratitude and infidelitie, not
disability. Is it harder now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store,
then at first to giue? When
God stirred vp his peoples affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
their Princes and Priests were
faine to set mortmaines &amp; bounds
to their bountie, and stay their
hands from giuing more. What
were a Subsidy or two for God &amp;
his church? If God giue vs hearts,
wood and the sacrifice will soone
be found, &amp; brought to hand; and
till this be done, a iust brand of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
lies vpon vs. It's impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for any application to extend
to euery particular. If euery Soule
would study thankfulnesse, God
would direct to the best duties. If
euery English man would kindle a
Bone-fire in his owne heart, how
would the flame break out, &amp; shine
abroad, and the smoke ascend vp to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20122:30"/>
the heauens? If euery thankfull
man would take vp his harpe, and
sing and play with his tongue and
hand a new Song of thankes, how
lowd and full melody would it
make, what ioy would bee on the
earth, yea in the heauens to see our
thankfulnes and amendment. It is
but euery mans labour to sweepe
before his owne doore, and euery
mans Fagot to this fire, and the
worke were done, &amp; God pleased.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20122:31"/>
whose eye is now vpon this
aduise, then wouldest thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
endeuor to worke the like
in others; and so a small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
by multiplication might
prooue a large summe: as a
great debt is often paid by a
collection from many hands,
which one poore mans abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
could neuer haue reached
vnto. That we may be aright
thankfull, it is requisite that
with one eye we obserue our
sinnes and euils both publike
and personall; and with the
other our favours and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
that the one may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
vs with our vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse;
the other may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20122:31"/>
male contented vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.
Many a man would
be much more thankfull then
he is, if he had but an hint of
excitation and helpe of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
as many a Scholler, if
hee had but a fewe Heads of
Common places, would bee
rich in obseruations, which
for want of such a sleight
helpe vanish in the reading,
and perish in the meditating.
Behold therefore, I giue thee
here a Register or Inventory,
which I wish thee to keepe,
and vse as a Table of thanks
due to God in kind, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
by thee paid. Which
when thou perusest, thou
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20122:32"/>
mayest vnder euery Head in
the space left of purpose, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
not all and euery fauour,
which is impossible, but the
most memorable, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy;
putting a speciall <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi>
of thankes vpon them, as
<hi>Dauid</hi> vpon his deliuerance
from the Beare, Lyon, and
<hi>Goliah.</hi> It cannot but reuiue
thy memory, and quicken thy
affections, so often as thou
shalt seriously reuiew it.</p>
