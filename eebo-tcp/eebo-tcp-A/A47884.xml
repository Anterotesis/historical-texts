            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>We need not run beyond our Memories to agree this Point, it being within the Ken of our own Notice, that Libels were not only the <hi>Fore-runners,</hi> but in a high Degree, the <hi>Causes</hi> of our late <hi>Troubles:</hi> and what were the frequent, open, and licentious <hi>Discourses</hi> of <hi>Cloak-men</hi> in Pulpits, but the ill-boding Play of <hi>Porpisces</hi> before a Tempest?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97901:4"/>We may remember also the <hi>false News</hi> of Plots agninst the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of the Nation, and how the <hi>King</hi> was charg'd as an <hi>Abetter</hi> of the <hi>Design.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may remember likewise, how the <hi>Irish Blood</hi> was cast upon the Account of his late Sacred Majesty, even by Those men whose guilty Souls are to Reckon with Divine Justice for every Drop of it.</p>

               <p>If we look well about us, we may find this Kingdom, at this Instant labouring under the same Distempers; the Press as <hi>busie</hi> and as <hi>bold</hi>; Sermons as <hi>factious</hi>; Pamphlets as <hi>sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>; the Government <hi>defam'd.</hi> The Lectures of the <hi>Faction</hi> are throng'd with pretended <hi>Converts</hi>; and scandalous <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> are as currant now as they were twenty years ago.</p>
               <p>These were ill Tokens <hi>then,</hi> and do they signifie just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>now</hi>? What means all This but the new Christening of the <hi>Old Cause</hi>? the doing over again of the <hi>Prologue</hi> to the last <hi>Tragedy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> proceeds, [<hi>That Disputing, Excusing, Cavelling upon Mandates and Directions,, is a kind of shaking off the Yoak, and Assay of Disobedience; especially if in those Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, they which are for the Direction, speak fearfully and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; and those that are against it, audaciously.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herein is judiciously expressed the <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Gradation,</hi> from Duty to Disobedience. The first step is to <hi>Dispute</hi>; as who should say, <hi>I will if I may.</hi> The very <hi>Doubt of Obeying,</hi> subjects the <hi>Authority</hi> to a <hi>Question,</hi> and gives a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Hint to the People, That <hi>Kings</hi> are accountable to their Subjects.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Excuse</hi> is a Degree worse, for that's no other than a <hi>Refusal</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> in a Tacit Regard either of an <hi>unjust Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> or of an <hi>unlawful Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To cavil at the <hi>Mandates</hi> of a Prince, is an express <hi>Affront</hi> to his <hi>Dignity,</hi> and within one Remove of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>What's more familiar at this Day, than <hi>disputing</hi> His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties <hi>Orders; disobeying</hi> his <hi>Proclamations,</hi> and <hi>vilifying Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament?</hi> Whereof there are so many, and so Audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Instances, it shall suffice to have made this General men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
               <p>Another Observation is, that, <hi>When Discords and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and Factions, are carried openly and audaciously, it is a Sign the Reverence of Government is lost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the temper of that Juncture, when the <hi>Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Part of the <hi>two Houses,</hi> and the <hi>Tumultuary Rabble</hi> joyn'd their Interests against <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>; which Insolence was but a Prelude to the succeeding Rebellion.</p>
               <p>And are not <hi>Factions carried Openly</hi> and <hi>Audaciously</hi> now? when the <hi>Promoters,</hi> and <hi>Iustifiers</hi> of the <hi>Murther</hi> of the late <hi>King,</hi> are still continued <hi>publick Preachers,</hi> without the least pretence to a <hi>Retraction</hi>; Dictating still, by <hi>Gestures, Shrugs,</hi> and <hi>Signs,</hi> That Treason to their Auditory which they dare not <hi>Vtter</hi>? What are their <hi>Sermons,</hi> but <hi>Declamations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Bishops: <hi>Their Covenant-keeping Exhortations,</hi> but the <hi>contempt</hi> of an <hi>establish'd Law?</hi> How it comes to pass, Heaven knows; but These Honest Fellows can come off for <hi>Printing</hi> and <hi>publishing</hi> down-right <hi>Treason,</hi> when I have much ado to scape for Telling of it.</p>
               <p>Whither these Liberties tend, let any Man look over his shoulder, and satisfie himself.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>To speak only of the last, The want of Treasure was the Ruine of the late King; Through which defect, his <hi>Officers</hi> were expos'd to be <hi>Corrupted,</hi> his <hi>Counsels</hi> to be <hi>Betray'd,</hi> his <hi>Armies</hi> to be ill <hi>pay'd,</hi> and consequently not well <hi>Disciplin'd:</hi> Briefly, where a <hi>Prince</hi> is Poor, and a <hi>Faction</hi> Rich, the Purse is in the wrong Pocket.</p>

               <p>THE True <hi>Cause</hi> of the late War, was <hi>Ambition</hi>: which being lodg'd in a confederate <hi>Cabale</hi> of <hi>Scotch,</hi> and <hi>English,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>League</hi> we may presume was perfected in 1637.

Three Years before the meeting of the Long Parliament) which Provision seems to intimate That <hi>Conspiracy.</hi> And now the Poyson begins to work.</p>
               <p>Upon the 23 of <hi>Iuly</hi> in the same Year, (according to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Warning given the Sunday before) the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> began to read the <hi>Service-Book</hi> in the Church of Saint <hi>Giles</hi>: whereupon ensued so horrid a <hi>Tumult,</hi>

               <p>But we must not forget the Solemn <hi>Investiture of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, by Authority of Parliament</hi>; (forsooth) and yet we must not make the <hi>Bauble Proud</hi> neither, by saying too much on't.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Foolery</hi> was perform'd in <hi>Westminster Hall,</hi> where his <hi>Highness</hi> was presented with a <hi>Coat:</hi> to wit,<note place="margin">

               <p>But <hi>Comedy</hi> and Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> will scarce agree in the same <hi>Period:</hi> and why? Let us <hi>Expostulate.</hi> Does not a <hi>Counterfeit</hi> or a <hi>Mimique</hi> better become a <hi>Stage</hi> than a <hi>Pulpit?</hi> Or is it not as lawful to see Honest <hi>Lacy</hi> play a snivelling <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> as a perfidious bloody <hi>Traytor</hi> to sustain the Person of a Gracious <hi>Prince?</hi> Yet here his <hi>Holiness Acts his</hi> Part <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>; (or in the <hi>Gibberish</hi> of the <hi>Brethren) performs the Duty of the Day:</hi> Pronouncing a <hi>Blessing</hi> upon the <hi>horrid</hi> and <hi>ridiculous Spectacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did not Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> know that <hi>Cromwell</hi> was an <hi>Impostur</hi>; and that the <hi>Purple Robe</hi> he ware, belong'd not to his <hi>Shoulders? How as a</hi> Minister <hi>of the</hi> Gospel <hi>then, could he</hi> Officiate <hi>to such a piece of</hi> Pageantry? It minds me of <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s <hi>Kinsman,</hi> that upon a <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> in Derision, <hi>Crucified</hi> a <hi>Frog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He knew moreover, that he was a <hi>Murderer,</hi> and an <hi>Vsurper,</hi> and that the <hi>Gawdy Bible</hi> then before him, was but to <hi>Him</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> he <hi>Conjur'd</hi> by. <hi>How as a</hi> Christian <hi>could he own the</hi> Augury?</p>
               <p>Further, He knew whose <hi>Blood</hi> he had <hi>Spilt,</hi> whose <hi>Rights</hi> he <hi>usurped</hi>; and that the <hi>murther'd Father,</hi> and his <hi>injur'd Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> were <hi>Both</hi> his <hi>SOVERAIGNS:</hi> The <hi>Ceremonial Sword</hi> and <hi>Scepter</hi> likewise he knew the <hi>meaning</hi> of. <hi>How as a</hi> Subject <hi>then could he submit to Countenance so</hi> Undutiful <hi>an Vndertaking</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:97901:15"/>Lastly, He knew that the <hi>Design</hi> was (in <hi>Truth</hi> utterly <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistick,</hi> but in <hi>shew) Independent. How as a</hi> Presbyterian <hi>could he agree to't?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all this now, Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> may thank himself. 'Tis true, he did Exceeding well, on the late <hi>Fast,</hi> to reckon <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> and <hi>Prophaness</hi> among Those <hi>Crying Sins</hi> that draw God's <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> upon a People, and Earnestly to press a <hi>Reformation.</hi> But, how come <hi>Playes</hi> into the <hi>Rank</hi> of these <hi>Provoking Sins</hi>?

               </p>

               <head>CAP. VII. A short Account from the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Tyrant Oliver,</hi> to the <hi>Return</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, (whom God Preserve from his Fathers Enemies.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Heart</hi> of the <hi>Cause</hi> was broken long since, and now the <hi>Soul</hi> of it is gone; though the Protectorate be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally devolv'd to <hi>Richard,</hi> as the <hi>Declar'd Successour</hi> to his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Whether <hi>Declar'd</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> was (I remember) at That time a Question. But whether Thus or So, it Matters not. <hi>Oliver</hi> is <hi>Dead,</hi> his <hi>Son</hi> Proclaim'd, and at night <hi>Bon-fires,</hi> with all the Clamor, Bustle, and Confusion that commonly attends those Vulgar Jollities. The Souldiers took the <hi>Alarm,</hi> and in my hearing threatned divers for daring to express their Joy so unseasonably: but they came off with telling them that they were glad they had got a <hi>New Protector,</hi> not that they had lost the <hi>Old.</hi> In Truth, the <hi>New Protector</hi> was look'd upon as a Person more <hi>Inclinable</hi> to do <hi>Good,</hi> than <hi>Capable</hi> to do <hi>Mischief,</hi> and the <hi>Exchange Welcome,</hi> to all that Lov'd his Majesty.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Court-Interest</hi> (as they call'd it,) <hi>Addresses</hi> thick and threefold were brought in, to <hi>Condole,</hi> and <hi>Gratulate</hi>; but Those Complements had no <hi>Sap</hi> in them: The <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Swede,</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> sent their <hi>Embassadours</hi> on the same Errand. And now the <hi>Funerals</hi> come on; A <hi>Solemn,</hi> and <hi>Expensive Pageantry</hi>; yet, in my Conscience, the <hi>Chief-Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> were his <hi>Highness Drapers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Ceremonies over, to keep the Wheel in Motion, a Supply was Resolv'd upon for the King of <hi>Swede,</hi> and little further of Moment, before <hi>Ian.</hi> 27.

               <p>This is the Tenor of that Canting Declaration, which the <hi>Army-Officers</hi> presented <hi>Lenthall (the Good-Old-Speaker)</hi> with, at the <hi>Rolls, May</hi> 6. in the Evening; where a Resolve was

               <p>They met accordingly, and made a shift, by Raking of <hi>Goals,</hi> to get together a <hi>Quorum,</hi>

               <p>This Device was <hi>fa-fetch'd,</hi> and not <hi>long-liv'd,</hi> but these were Old Stagers, and no ill Menagers of their Time.</p>
               <p>To make short; they Erect a Counsel of State, <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Displace</hi>; mould their <hi>Faction</hi>; settle the Godly, appoint their Committees, and so soon as ever they are Warm in their <hi>Gears,</hi> begin, where they left in 1653; <hi>Fleecing</hi> the <hi>Nation,</hi> and <hi>Flaying</hi> the <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> as briskly, as if 'twere but the <hi>Good-morrow</hi> to a <hi>Six-Years Nap.</hi>

                  <p>It is with <hi>Church-men</hi> as with <hi>other Mortals</hi>; There are of all Sorts, <hi>Good, Bad,</hi> and <hi>Indifferent. Some</hi> we have known, whom neither the <hi>Loss</hi> of <hi>Dignity, Fortune, Freedom,</hi> no, nor the Loss of <hi>Life</hi> it self, could ever move from the strict <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Conscience, Magnanimity,</hi> and <hi>Duty. Others</hi> we have seen to <hi>Exercise</hi> these Cruelties, (though <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticks</hi> themselves) upon the Nobler Sort of their own Function. And <hi>some</hi> again, we have observ'd to <hi>shift</hi> with every <hi>Turn,</hi> and Steer by <hi>Interest</hi>; still putting on the Livery of the Prevailing Party: Squaring the Rule, and Will of <hi>Heaven</hi> to the Appetites and Passions of <hi>Humanity.</hi> So that upon the whole, 'tis evident; <hi>some</hi> Clergy-men are <hi>Quiet,</hi> because they <hi>have</hi> Preferments, and <hi>Others Troublesom,</hi> because they <hi>want them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Principal <hi>Ingredients</hi> into <hi>Schism,</hi> are These; <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Avarice, Popularity,</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi>; The <hi>Scope</hi> of it is to destroy <hi>Authority,</hi> and advance a <hi>Faction.</hi> Now how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish This, is the Great Work; for a <hi>Rent</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> signifies nothing without a <hi>Sedition</hi> in the <hi>State:</hi> and in This manner they proceed.</p>
                  <p>First, In a Style of Holy Tenderness they slily disaffect the People against the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Rise of Schism.</note> as in themselves <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi>; and utterly Destructive of <hi>Christian Liberty.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The method of it.</note>To strengthen, and advance the <hi>Imposture,</hi> what do they <hi>next,</hi> but rip up all the <hi>Failings,</hi> and shew the <hi>Nakedness</hi> of their <hi>Superiours?</hi> Still <hi>aggravating</hi> what they <hi>find,</hi> and <hi>creating</hi> Scandalous Matter where they <hi>want</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>When the Multitude are once mov'd in <hi>Conscience</hi> against the <hi>Impositions,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The motion of Schism into Sedition.</note> and in <hi>Passion</hi> against the <hi>Imposers</hi>; their next attempt is upon the <hi>Authority,</hi> and then They divide into <hi>Separate Assemblies,</hi> which under colour of so many <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Dissenters</hi> from the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly so many <hi>Contrivers</hi> against the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:97901:29"/>
For <hi>here</hi> comes in the <hi>Civil Power</hi> to prohibit their Seditious <hi>Meetings,</hi> and Then, <hi>the Saints</hi> (they cry) <hi>are Persecuted</hi>: The <hi>Cause</hi> is <hi>God's</hi>;<note place="margin">The Design.</note> and they are ty'd in <hi>Conscience to bind their Kings in Chains</hi>; and through all Extremities to persue a <hi>Reformation: This is the Fruit of Tolerating a Faction under a Countenance of Conscience.</hi> Nor is it any wonder to see those wretches draw their <hi>Swords</hi> against Their <hi>Soveraign</hi> in the <hi>Field,</hi> whose <hi>Souls</hi> are turn'd against him in the <hi>Pulpit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But 'tis Objected, that <hi>some</hi> Ministers do really make a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> of <hi>Conformity.</hi> Truly, the better for <hi>Them,</hi> if they forbear upon <hi>That</hi> Accompt; but 'tis the same thing to the <hi>Publick,</hi> upon <hi>what account soever</hi>; for they <hi>Prescribe,</hi> what they <hi>Practise,</hi> and by the <hi>President</hi> of Sticking upon a <hi>Doubt</hi> of Conscience,<note place="margin">And Effect of it.</note>they open a Door to <hi>Disobedience</hi> upon any <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> of it, breaking the <hi>Bond</hi> of <hi>Vnity</hi> in favour of a Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>nicety</hi> of <hi>Opinion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Very notable is The Determination of the Lord St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> in This Case [<hi>In Points Fundamental,<note place="margin">Note.</note> he that is not with us is against us. In Points not Fundamental, he that is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, is with us.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Let this suffice to shew the <hi>Political Inconvenience of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Schismatical Preachers.</hi> It may be now a Question, <hi>How far a Christian Magistrate may justifie the sufferance of any man to exercise the Ministery, within his Dominions,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> May an enemy to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops exercise the Ministry?</note> 
                     <hi>that's a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd Enemy to Episcopacy:</hi> Which I Offer, with the fit <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty</hi> of a <hi>Proposal,</hi> and with <hi>Reverence,</hi> to the <hi>better enform'd.</hi> But if, as the <hi>Danger</hi> of such a Mixture is <hi>Evident,</hi> so the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of it shall appear <hi>doubtfull,</hi> their <hi>own Argument</hi> is then turn'd against <hi>Themselves,</hi> and we have both <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> on our side, over and above.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Three Questions,</hi> wherewith King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi> Choak'd the <hi>Presbyterian Ministers</hi> in the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> Remain still Unresolv'd, and they are These.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Is there any Certain Form of Church Government at all prescrib'd in the World?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>If there be any Prescript Form, Whether or no may the Civil Power Change the same, as they see Cause?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>If any Prescript Form there be, and That unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; If it were not Episcopal, what was it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Fact,</hi> the Constant <hi>Exercise</hi> of <hi>Church-Prelacy</hi> is so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that the whole stream of <hi>Story,</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> Runs <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal</hi>:

                     <p>The True Composition of a <hi>Confident</hi> fit for such a <hi>States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> as we here speak of, is <hi>This.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>He must be One that knows the Right, and Opposes it</hi>; for there is then less Danger of his <hi>Conversion,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>When a Person of This Character, repairs often to a <hi>Counsellour</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> a man may, without a <hi>Scandalum Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> take the Boldness to suspect his business.

                     </p>

                     <p>Another way of Detecting them, is from their <hi>Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>Behaviour.</hi>

                     </p>

they are Poor?</hi> No no, they <hi>should</hi> not; but what if they <hi>will</hi> do, what they ought not to do? [<hi>Let no Prince</hi> (says the Lord St. <hi>Albans) measure the Danger of Discontentments, by This; whether they be</hi> Just, <hi>or</hi> Unjust: <hi>for That were to Imagine People to be too Reasonable.</hi>] So that the Question is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cause can <hi>warrant</hi> a Commotion; but whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it may <hi>Provoke</hi> one? And whether the <hi>Multitude</hi> will not rather <hi>Tumult,</hi> then <hi>Starve.</hi> It is not Here, <hi>Delirant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Plectuntur Achivi</hi>â€” but on the Contrary; <hi>Delirant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chivi, Plectuntur Reges</hi>; The Faults of <hi>Servants</hi> are Reveng'd upon the Heads of their <hi>Masters.</hi> But to Reason the Matter orderly, and by Degrees, take it Thus.</p>
                     <p>All men do naturally Covet <hi>Power</hi>; Partly for their <hi>Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>;<note place="margin">The Politicks of the Vulgar.</note> and in Part, for <hi>Glory:</hi> not considering, that <hi>what Each Individual desires, All cannot enjoy</hi>; but finding Themselves Plac'd by Nature in a State of <hi>Equality,</hi> they are apt to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>One</hi> man has as good a Title to Dominion as <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> and <hi>from this Levelling opinion proceeds that Envy which we find Generally in the Common-People against their Governours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the same Grounds, they Contend for <hi>Liberty</hi>; and since they cannot <hi>Rule,</hi> they would at least be Free from the <hi>Restraint</hi> of <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Impositions.</hi> But this must not be, neither.</p>
                     <p>Why Then, let them but know the <hi>Bounds</hi> of their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> by which they are to be <hi>Govern'd.</hi> Yes, That they may; and when they are once enur'd, and wonted to the soft yoak of <hi>Political Order,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi>; their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Care is chiefly <hi>Profit,</hi> or <hi>Pleasure</hi>; and to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of such <hi>Conveniences,</hi> as to man's Life are either <hi>Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> or <hi>Delightfull,</hi> and <hi>Here</hi> they <hi>Rest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the summ of the <hi>Vulgar Politicks:</hi> Allow the <hi>People</hi> These <hi>Private Conveniences,</hi> and keep but the <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi> from Prating to them of <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi>; the <hi>Generality</hi> shall never trouble the State with <hi>Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> but he that strips them of their little <hi>Lavely-hood,</hi> rifles a Neast of <hi>Hornets.</hi> From whence ensues This double Mischief: <hi>A Great deal of Mony is drawn into a few hands; and a Great number of People are left without any at all:</hi> Two Hazards that might pose a wise Prince which rather to submit to.</p>
                     <p>As a <hi>General Poverty</hi> yields the most desperate matter for <hi>Sedition</hi>; so are <hi>the disorders of a Court</hi> the most likely means

                  <p>Some Armies we have known to Prove Troublesome, and to Divide,<note place="margin">A Holy War is a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> upon Pretenses of <hi>Religion</hi>; but, a <hi>Holy War</hi> is a Contradiction; and a Story only fit to pass upon <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Children.</hi> Upon the whole, it seems that an Army, within it <hi>self,</hi> and without any <hi>Separate Interest,</hi> may be troublesome upon These <hi>Three Accounts:</hi> Either <hi>Want of Pay</hi>; which causes a <hi>General Mutiny:</hi> or <hi>Disgrace</hi>; which (more Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly reflecting upon such or such <hi>Officers, Troops,</hi> or <hi>Parties</hi>) provokes <hi>Animosities, Factions,</hi> and <hi>Revolts:</hi> or <hi>Ambition</hi>; which more directly attempts upon the <hi>Sovereignty.</hi> It may be also <hi>Hazardous,</hi> by reason of some <hi>Errour</hi> in the <hi>Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of it. That is; if it be composed of Persons <hi>Ill-affected</hi> to the Government, it cannot rationally be expected, that it should labour to <hi>Preserve,</hi> what it wishes to <hi>Destroy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we are treating of Distempers <hi>acquir'd</hi>; and rather proceeding from the <hi>ill menage</hi> of an Army, than from the first <hi>Mis-choice,</hi> or founded in the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of it. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Standing-Army,</hi> enough is said in the foregoing Chapter:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97901:38"/>
a word we'l add; It is in This Regard, an Affair of a Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish Quality; that <hi>either a General has too little</hi> Power <hi>to do his</hi> Masters <hi>Business, or</hi> enough <hi>to do his</hi> own.</p>
                  <p>As it is not safe for a <hi>Monarch,</hi> at any time, to entrust the Chief Officer of an Army, with so much Power,<note place="margin">Hazard not a Rebellion in one Place, for fear of a Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> for fear of a <hi>Sedition,</hi> as may enable him to move a <hi>Rebellion.</hi> So is it a work of great <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Difficulty,</hi> so dexterously to <hi>Resume,</hi> or <hi>Ballance</hi> that <hi>over-grown Power,</hi> as to bring it under <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> without discovering such a <hi>Iealousie,</hi> as may Provoke him to <hi>abuse</hi> it. Let This suffice, as to the Disorders of an Army <hi>within it self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Hazard is, lest it be <hi>Corrupted</hi> into a Dependence, upon some other Interest: into which Defection, it may be partly Driven by the <hi>Neglect</hi> or <hi>Vnkindness</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and partly Drawn by the <hi>Allurements</hi> of <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having spoken of the Mischief a <hi>Seditious Army</hi> may <hi>Doe</hi>; very briefly let us behold what Mischiefs a <hi>Vicious</hi> and <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disciplin'd</hi> Army may <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There never fails to be an Opposition betwixt the <hi>Civil,</hi> and the <hi>Military Power</hi>; and in like manner betwixt the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and the <hi>Souldiery.</hi> Whom nothing else can Reconcile but down-right <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Necessity.</hi> So that the fairest State of a Nation over-aw'd by an Army of their own Country men, is an <hi>extorted Patience,</hi> accompany'd with Readiness to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any opportunity of working their Deliverance.</p>

that in <hi>some Cases, some People,</hi> will in <hi>some Sort,</hi> do <hi>some Things</hi> as they ought to do. Yet we are where we were; that is, they will be <hi>Guessing</hi> still.</p>
                     <p>If Taxes follow <hi>quicker,</hi> and run <hi>higher</hi> then Ordinary; they cry: <hi>so much?</hi> and the next Question's <hi>Why?</hi> ('Tis true, they should not <hi>Aske,</hi> but who can hinder them?)</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Third,</hi> is the <hi>Inequality</hi> of <hi>Taxes</hi>; the <hi>Over-pressing</hi> of any <hi>One</hi> Party.

First,</hi> That the People are <hi>Iudges</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi>; and <hi>Next,</hi> That because God alone has Power over their Souls, the <hi>Soveraign</hi> has none over their Bodies.</p>
                  <p>As to the Honesty of a <hi>Dissenting Brother</hi>; his Honesty is only to himself, but his Dissent is to the <hi>Publick:</hi> and the <hi>Better</hi> the <hi>Man</hi> is, the <hi>Worse</hi> is the <hi>President.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vpon these hazards, depends the Royalty of That Soveraign, that dispenses with the Law, to Indulge This Faction:</hi> and, which is the great Pitty of all, the <hi>better</hi> he deserves, the <hi>worse</hi> they use him. So that the only way for a Prince to deal Safely with <hi>These People,</hi> is <hi>first</hi> to lay aside That <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,</hi> and <hi>Fatal Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Steer</hi> his <hi>Resolutions</hi> by the <hi>Compass</hi> of a <hi>Severe,</hi> and <hi>Inexorable Reason.</hi> Not that <hi>Kings</hi> are <hi>Gods,</hi> in any Respect, more then in their <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi>; but there are certain <hi>Cases,</hi> and <hi>Instances,</hi> wherein That <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> may be Restrain'd; and wherein 'tis possible that what is Excellent in <hi>Nature,</hi> may be a <hi>slip</hi> in <hi>Government.</hi> 'Tis One Thing for a Party to ask <hi>Pardon</hi> for a <hi>Fault</hi> already Committed, and another thing to beg a <hi>Dispensation</hi> beforehand, to Commit it. And there's this <hi>Difference</hi> also in the Issue of the <hi>Grants.</hi> The Prince has the <hi>Faction</hi> at his <hi>Mercy,</hi> the One way; and the <hi>Faction</hi> has got the Prince at Theirs, the Other. But to the Point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Will the Monarch's yielding to this, or that, content them?</hi> They'l say 'tis all they aime at; and truly I'd believe them: would they but shew me out of their whole Tribe, any one Instance of This Moderation to save the Credit of my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;<note place="margin">The Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</note> Any <hi>Presbyterian Interest</hi> in Nature that is not <hi>Rais'd</hi> upon the Ruins of a Prince, and <hi>Cimented</hi> with Broken <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Promises.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be thus; Nothing less then a Miracle can secure that Monarch that makes this Faction Master of the Pulpit: and this, King <hi>Charles,</hi> the Martyr, prov'd by sad Experience: For not a Soul that by the Instigation of Schismatical Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures deserted the Church, but became an Enemy to the State. So that Effectually a Gracious Toleration in some Cases, is by some People understood no otherwise, then as a <hi>Tacit Commission</hi> from the Person of the King to Levy a Warr against his Office.

                     <p>The <hi>Over-great Counsellor</hi> we here Treat of, is as the <hi>Malus Genius</hi> of a Nation: And in Two Words, behold the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Summe</hi> of the Whole Mischief.

                     <p>To Conclude; <hi>It is great Prudence in Publike Affairs, to commit little to Hazard</hi>; and it is no <hi>small Hazard,</hi> to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a <hi>Favourite</hi> to strong <hi>Temptations.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Dangers from the Camp.</note> are Principally these Three; <hi>Mutiny, Revolt,</hi> or <hi>Popular Risings,</hi> (provoked by the <hi>Oppression</hi> or <hi>Insolence</hi> of the <hi>Souldiery)</hi> Of <hi>These,</hi> in their <hi>Order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mutinies</hi> may be Caus'd by <hi>Want of Pay</hi>;<note place="margin">How Mutinies may be caused.</note> some defect of <hi>Discipline</hi>; by <hi>New-Modelling; Disbanding; Disgrace,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>That Prince that Raises an Army which he cannot <hi>Pay Himself,</hi> raises it (in effect) for some body else that <hi>can.</hi> In short, a very great Hazard it is, to have the <hi>Souldiery</hi> Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon any <hi>Other Interest</hi> then That of the <hi>Monarch.</hi> Where it so falls out, that a Prince lies subjected to the <hi>Double Inconvenience,</hi> both of having an <hi>Army,</hi> and of <hi>Want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mony</hi>; Let him be sure of a most <hi>Exquisite Choice</hi> of <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> both for <hi>Honesty,</hi> and <hi>Ability:</hi> That the <hi>Body</hi> likewise may be <hi>well Chosen,</hi> and <hi>well Govern'd.</hi> For he has enough to do, that undertakes to keep his Troops in <hi>Order,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Pay</hi>; but if they want <hi>Affection</hi> too, the Point is <hi>Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi> This is the <hi>Nick</hi> of <hi>Danger,</hi> and <hi>Temptation</hi>; for a <hi>Necessitous Army,</hi> of <hi>This Mixture,</hi> is any man's Mony that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97901:65"/>

                  <p>The <hi>New-Modelling</hi> of an Army is also a <hi>tickle Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking:</hi> and so is the <hi>Disbanding.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Modelling and Disbanding are dangerous.</note> The <hi>Former</hi> is the <hi>sharper Disobligation</hi>; but 'tis but <hi>Personall:</hi> The <hi>Latter</hi> is the more <hi>Dangerous,</hi> for it <hi>Destroyes</hi> the <hi>Trade:</hi> And the <hi>Perill</hi> is either from the Influence of some <hi>Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> in the One; or from a <hi>Disposition</hi> common to all <hi>Military,</hi> as well as <hi>Naturall bodies,</hi> in the <hi>Other:</hi> that is, an <hi>Averseness to Dissolution.</hi> Both the <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Other,</hi> are a work to be dispatch'd with as <hi>much Care,</hi> and with as <hi>little Noise,</hi> as possible: very <hi>Tenderly,</hi> and by <hi>Degrees.</hi>
