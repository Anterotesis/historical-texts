            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E doubt not but your <hi>Excellency</hi> is informed, how that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, on Sunday laſt being the 18. of Februarie old Stile, marched with his whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er foure daies, and foure nights one after another, and came with a great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and noyſe falling upon us, when we had not all our Troupes together, with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to relieve <hi>Rhyns-field,</hi> and to raiſe our ſiege.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe we found our ſelves in ſuch a ſtate, that we durſt make head againſt him, and attend his comming, and fought hard all that day, not knowing who ſhould have the better of it; notwithſtanding this long diſpute, the enemy loſt many more men than we did, and becauſe the enemy drew on, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21830:3"/>
the night overtooke us, both ſides held the field; but wee marched the ſame night up towards <hi>Loopenburch,</hi> to joyne with our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, which lay on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> And on Tueſday after (in the name of God) wee marched againe directly upon the Enemy, and gave him a brave charge.</p>
            <p>And ſo upon Wedneſday betweene <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> and <hi>Rhynſ-field,</hi> the Enemy drawing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to battaile, wee fell upon them ſo hotly, breaking their Battalions, that it pleaſed the Almighty God to caſt his gracious eye upon us, and to give us a brave Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over our Enemies. In which battaile we tooke not only both the Generalls of the Emperours Army, namely, the <hi>Duke de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velli,</hi> and <hi>John de Weerdt,</hi> and likewiſe two Serjeant Major Generalls of the Army, to wit, <hi>Erckefort, Speerruyter,</hi> but alſo all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonells and Lieutenant Colonells with other Officers, yea all (ſaving thoſe that were ſlain) moſt of them Horſemen; and all their Foot are taken Priſoners: yea ſo many that there eſcaped none, but Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy</hi>; beſides a great number of Standards, Colours and Cornets, given into our hands, with others brought unto us every day.</p>
            <p>This bleſſing over our Armes, which it hath pleaſed the Almighty God graciouſly to give us, we hope by his helpe it may tend
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21830:3"/>
to the deliverance of many poore afflicted and diſtreſſed people, but eſpecially for the good and the ſtrengthening of the Armes of the Kingdome of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring of many others, which ſerve under the Command of the Lord Marſhall <hi>Bannier,</hi> as likewiſe for the good of our deare Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to the comfort of the oppreſſed Churches in it, that profeſſe the Goſpel, which we hope may tend to the reſtauration thereof againe.</p>
            <p>Wee have therefore cauſe from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of our hearts, to render thankes, glory and praiſe unto Almighty God for this great and extraordinary benefit, that it will pleaſe him to continue his fatherly helpe and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance more and more unto us, and to bleſſe, governe, and direct by his good providence our deſignes, that they may all tend to the glory of his holy Name, for the good of the Kingdome of <hi>Swethland</hi> and the State of the Evangelicall League, that at laſt we may obtaine that long deſired peace.</p>

            <p>I Cannot omit to give your Lordſhip to underſtand by theſe, the great Victory, which <hi>Duke Bernard Wymer</hi> hath got over the <hi>Imperialliſts.</hi> Laſt Sunday about two of the Clock in the after-noone <hi>John de Weerdt,</hi> the <hi>Duke de Savelli,</hi> the <hi>Earle of Furſtenbergh,</hi> and <hi>Speerruyter</hi> came with nine Regiments of Horſe, two Regiments of <hi>Dragoones,</hi> two Companies of <hi>Crabats,</hi> and two thouſand Foot (among which there were many <hi>Swart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waldiſh</hi> Peſants) through the <hi>Swartwalde</hi> to <hi>Bucken</hi> by <hi>Rhynefield,</hi> with intent to fall upon the <hi>Duke of Wymer</hi> in <hi>Bucken</hi> unawares. But the Duke having got intelligence of their comming, roſe with ſixe Regiments of horſe, and ſixe hundred Muskettiers, to meet the Enemy, and fought with them till evening,

many men falling on both ſides, but the moſt on the Dukes ſide, in regard hee was much weaker than the Enemy; for a great many of his men being ſent abroad to get intelligence of the Enemy. Whereupon hee preſently quitted the ſiege of <hi>Rhynefield,</hi> and gathered all his men and Ordinance together, to make a head againſt the Enemy, which were quartered upon the hills, having but little forrage and victualls with them, becauſe of the mountaines; ſo that in regard of the ſhortneſſe of the time, they could not bring much along with them. About the middeſt of the laſt weeke, at the breake of the day, <hi>John de Weerdt</hi> brake up againe, and for want of forrage was driven to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Friburgh,</hi> whereupon Duke <hi>Barent</hi> tooke ſome Ordinance along with him, and went to encounter the Enemy, and met with him not far from <hi>Rhynefield</hi> at <hi>Overwylen,</hi> and fell upon them with ſuch a fury, routed and beat them ſo, that it is thought there is not above foure hundred men left of them eſcaped, taking all their Standards, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Horſe and foot Colours; ſo that every one of the Dukes ſouldiers got two three or foure priſoners: Alſo all their Chiefes and Officers, as <hi>John de Weerdt,</hi> the <hi>Duke of Savelli, Furſtenbergh, Speerruyter, Serjeant Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Erkefort,</hi> all taken priſoners; ſo that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21830:7"/>
the <hi>Wimeriſh</hi> account this a greater Victory than the Battaile of <hi>Nordelingen.</hi> For verely it is a great and a brave Victory, that three Generalls of the Emperours at a time, and in one Battaile ſhould be overthrowne and taken priſoners. There were ſlaine dead upon the place 2500 men, beſides many that were cut in pieces by the Turne pikes.</p>
            <p>The number of priſoners taken on the Emperours ſide are accounted to bee above two thouſand, but there are not many loſt on the Dukes ſide; among the which there was the <hi>Rhyne-grave John Philips,</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander Bredendorf, Scavilliski,</hi> and the <hi>Chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Erlach</hi> carried priſoners into <hi>Rhyne-field,</hi> which by taking in of the towne will be all ſet at liberty: For Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the Towne againe with all earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and hopes in a ſhort time to become maſter of it. The Imperialliſts were two to one, which is accounted a brave buſineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Wimeriſh</hi> to beat their enemies ſo all to pieces.</p>
