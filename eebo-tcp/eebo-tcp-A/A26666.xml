            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is likewiſe prophecied, That in the year, 1652. the Engliſh ſhall become Maſters of <hi>France</hi>; And in the year, 1653 the Germans and Danes ſhall ſubmit.

The Parl. of <hi>Paris</hi> ſent two of their Members to the Court to the King and Queen, to inhibite the coming in of the ſaid Cardinal, which two Members were taken priſoners; but this breach doth exceedingly exaſperate the ſpirits of the Parl. Inſomuch, that they immediatly ſent a Declaration to the King, Wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>That if his Majeſty would not vouchſafe to hearken to the advice of his Parliament, and to leave his evil Councel, and return to</hi> Paris <hi>within the ſpace of ten dayes, that then they would depoſe him, ſequeſter all his Lands and Revenues, degrade Him of his Crown, Honours, and Dignities, and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Him and the Kingdoms Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> is come into <hi>Province</hi> with 6000 ſouldiers from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to aſſiſt the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> ſent a Meſſage to his Highneſſe, aſſuring his Excellency that he hath 2000 Horſe, and 2000 Foot for his ſervice. The Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of <hi>France,</hi> and divers other Dukes, Marqueſſes, and Noblemen, offer great ſums of money out of their own Eſtates to maintain him.

his integrity to be true and faithful therein, in the preſervation and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſo great and good a Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Senate of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> (ſince the Cardinals coming in) ſent to the King to take off the Declaration againſt the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> But inſtead thereof, the King ſent a Proclamation to his Atturney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, by which the Parliament, Jurats, and all their Officers there, are diſcharged of their Offices, which ſo inflamed them, that they took the Letters from the Atturney General, and ſent them to the Prince, reſolving to adhere to the Prince upon that account.</p>
            <p>His Highneſſe the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> forces are marched towards <hi>Zayr,</hi> to hinder the Cardinal from joyning, or getting to the King at <hi>Poictiers.</hi> Col. <hi>Hollac</hi> (a German) is come in to the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> with 500 gallant Horſe, and were honourably entertained.

            <p>From <hi>Scotland</hi> they write, That the laſt week there was a generall meeting of the Miniſters and Lay-men in <hi>Edenburgh</hi>; their debates are very high, crying out, <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Epheſians; <hi>Great is the</hi> Scots <hi>Presb<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From <hi>Genoa</hi> thus: That ſince the coming of Don <hi>John</hi> into the Leaguer before <hi>Barcelona,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> are with 3000 Foot, and 1000 Horſe recruited, that they approach the City daily, and never leave off to vex them, by day with Canon, and by night with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes: 500 ſheep going before the Town are taken. At the Sea-Coaſt it was beſieged with 30 ſhips, and 16 Galleys, ſo that it was impoſſible to bring there any thing more in; and they have taken the two Barques with corn that intended to have come in. The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonians</hi> began to ſtrengthen the Forts (on the place formerly where the Jews uſe to bury their dead) to entertain correſpondence with the City, but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> are about to hinder them.

            <p>At <hi>Genoa</hi> are arrived the Gallies from <hi>Spain</hi> with a million of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. A great Fleet is ſetting forth for the ſafety of that Republick.</p>
            <p>In the next place, take a review (I beſeech you) of certain remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able preſidents, worthy of obſervation.</p>

               <hi>Agrippa</hi> the elder being in <hi>Ceſaraea,</hi> and cloathed with ſumptuous apparel, and ſitting in a high and regal ſeat, began to make a ſpeech to the people; but ſome of his people cryed out, that it was the voice of ſome God, and not of man; which words being grateful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, (who could be willing to aſſume divine honour to himſelf) he was ſuddenly ſtrucken with an Angel, and ſo his fleſh and bowels putrifying, he was conſumed with lice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Syrians</hi> being overcome in War by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in certain mountainous places, aſcribed their overthrow to the Gods of the Mountains, who (they ſaid) did favour the <hi>Iſraelite</hi>; therefore they would fight with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the vallies, where they thought the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not intereſſed; upon which cauſe, God by his Prophet thus ſpake to the King of <hi>Iſrael; Quia dixerunt Syri, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Syrians ſaid, the Lord is God of the Mountains, and not of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, I will give all this great multitude in to thy hand, and you ſhall know, that I am the Lord.</hi> And thereupon both their Armies joyning battel after, the Iſraelites (though but few in number) killed in one day a hundred thouſand footmen: And there remained in a neer place twenty ſeven thouſand Syrians, who flying into the City, were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the fall of the City walls: doubtleſly this was a manifeſt revenge and puniſhment of the former blaſphemy.</p>

His blaſphemous tongue was likewiſe cut off.</p>
            <p>At what time <hi>Achior</hi> commended the power of the God of heaven, and averred, that the Jewes were ſecure and ſafe, in that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God religiouſly, at which words <hi>Holofernes</hi> in great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

            <p>
               <hi>Antiochus</hi> for his pride and blaſphemy, was ſtrucken from God with an inviſible and incurable diſeaſe; for firſt, ſuddenly a violent pain of his Bowels invaded him; and then quickly after he fell out of his chariot, wounding himſelf dangerouſly: laſtly his body pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying with a filthy conſumption, and breathing out a moſt loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſmell, was conſumed alive with worms.</p>
