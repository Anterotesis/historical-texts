            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>WE</hi> have been a diſtracted Nation theſe many Years, and ſome are of opinion, that amongſt other Cauſes, the <hi>Pulpits</hi> have in no ſmall meaſure contributed to the improving its Misfortunes. I here meddle not with the Truth of this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; whilſt in this Time of Liberty, every one may be of what Judgment they pleaſe; But being heartily ſenſible, that his Majeſty do's at this Time earneſtly deſire the Peace and Welfare of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I think it ought to be the Concern of every good Subject, to endeavor, as much as in them lies, to remove all Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that may any ways poſſibly hinder the effecting ſo good a Work. And becauſe amongſt the many <hi>Engines,</hi> that move
<pb facs="tcp:64141:3"/>
the People, the <hi>Pulpits</hi> have the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Influence; 'tis of ſome Concern, that all Abuſes ſhould be ſecluded from thoſe <hi>Chairs,</hi> by the Moderation of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, a Loyal, and a Wiſe Spirit. What I ſpeak here is of all <hi>Pulpits,</hi> whether of <hi>Conformiſts</hi> or Diſſenters, <hi>of</hi> what ſort ſoever, whether <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and not at all concerning my ſelf with their ſeveral Interpretations of the Goſpel, and differing Sentiments in Myſteries of Faith, I only deſire, that however they diſagree in theſe, they be yet perfectly united in the Spirit of <hi>Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and in deſiring the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Nation: And to this end I know of no better Rule to be obſerv'd, than that of the <hi>Congregational Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in their Addreſs to his Majeſty from <hi>Great Yarmouth: We faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

               <hi>promiſe your Majeſty, that we</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64141:3"/>
               <hi>will neither Preach nor Teach, nor ſuffer any thing to be ſo Preach'd or Taught amongſt us, which may any ways tend to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate the Hearts of your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from your Majeſty's Perſon and Government; but ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to contribute the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Aſſiſtance thereunto we are capable of, in our ſeveral Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> This is a <hi>Promiſe</hi> and a <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and I wiſh 'twere writ over every <hi>Pulpit</hi> of the Kingdom, that it might there ſtand as a <hi>Teſt</hi> for <hi>Preachers;</hi> that nothing might be Diſpens'd from thoſe Places, but what did agree with theſe Meaſures. I would not have any <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> boaſt of his <hi>Loyalty,</hi> till his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons have paſs'd this Trial: for if it be the part of an <hi>Open Enemy</hi> and a <hi>Treacherous Mind,</hi> to alienate the
<pb facs="tcp:64141:4"/>
Peoples Hearts from their Sovereign; I cannot tell how he that do's this in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Loyal,</hi> when he that ſhould do it in the <hi>Field</hi> would be a <hi>Traitor.</hi> To the end therefore that theſe Abuſes may have no acceſs to <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,</hi> but that theſe may contribute to the Peace of the Nation, to the removing all Animoſities, and eſtabliſhing a general Satisfaction in the Hearts of all his Majeſty's Subjects, to the uniting them in one Knot of Loyalty and Love; I think it may not be amiſs to lay down a few Cautions, which may give ſome Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in order to the arriving at this End. 'Twould be a bold Preſumption, I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to undertake to <hi>Teach</hi> the <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> but if it be ſo contriv'd, as to let the Teachers Teach themſelves, it may not be ſo obnoxious to Cenſure, eſpecially when the Deſign is ſo General a Good.</p>

               <p>FOR the preſerving a Firm Peace, and good Underſtanding amongſt his Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſhutting a Gate againſt all the Endeavors of Malice and Envy; 'tis very convenient for every <hi>Diviſion</hi> of Believers in this Nation to take care, that if any <hi>Wicked Villains,</hi> or <hi>Proſtitute Wretches,</hi> ſhould appear againſt any one Party, blackning it with Infamous Crimes, charging it with the fouleſt of Wickedneſs, and then back all with <hi>Proteſtations</hi> and <hi>Oaths,</hi> and pawn their Souls for the Truth of what they aſſert; 'tis very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, I ſay, that Men of all other Perſuaſions, in this Caſe, ſhould take care, that theſe <hi>Accuſations</hi> do not preſently get up into the <hi>Pulpit;</hi> and that their <hi>Teachers</hi> be Cautious, not to catch at every thing they hear thus proteſted at the <hi>Bar</hi> by an <hi>Informer</hi> with a <hi>Bible</hi> at his Lips, nor diſpenſe it to their Congregation, as if they had diſcover'd it in the Goſpel, which they hold in their Hands. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64141:5"/>
betwixt the <hi>Bar</hi> and the <hi>Pulpit</hi> ought to be carefully obſerv'd, becauſe the <hi>Pulpit</hi> is only for the Delivery of the <hi>Word of God;</hi> and all that is at the <hi>Bar</hi> is not ſo, but many times <hi>Lies, Perjuries, Malicious Inventions, Putid Calumnies</hi> are there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd: And, beſides, that <hi>theſe</hi> do ill become the <hi>Houſe of God;</hi> what a violation muſt there be of <hi>Charity,</hi> when the <hi>Oath</hi> of a <hi>Miſcreant</hi> is made the Religion of the People; and they are taught to hate thoſe for Conſcience ſake, whom by the Law of God they are commanded to love?</p>
               <p>This Caution all <hi>Preachers</hi> ought to carry along with them, that ſo they be not Inſtrumental in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the Peace of this Nation, which 'tis their Duty, both as they are Chriſtians and Subjects, to preſerve. And this I ſay, tho' the Parties accus'd happen to be ſuch whoſe Principles they diſlike, and to whoſe Intereſt they are highly diſaffected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Matter is of Concern, and therefore 'twill not be improper to elucidate it by Example; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Averſion againſt thoſe call'd <hi>Papiſts</hi> is moſt general, I'll let them be the Inſtance. Suppoſe therefore that they were accus'd by Men of Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lives, of the worſt of Crimes, of Deſigning againſt the Life of their Sovereign, againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion Eſtabliſh'd, againſt the Liberty and Property of their Fellow-Subjects, and theſe Accuſations ſhou'd be preſs'd againſt them with the moſt <hi>Sacred Proteſtations</hi> and <hi>Repeated Oaths</hi> of the <hi>Accuſers:</hi> yet would it not be convenient for the <hi>Teachers</hi> of any <hi>other Perſuaſion,</hi> to proclaim theſe Men Guilty from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and incenſe their Congregation againſt the <hi>ſuppos'd Criminals,</hi> however advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64141:5"/>
their Downfall might be to the Intereſt of their Party.

in <hi>Teachers,</hi> how low muſt their Credit and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſink with all ſober Men, who know that where theſe Qualities are not, there can be no more of a Preacher beſides the Name and a Noiſe?</p>
               <p>For my part, I think 'tis the Common Intereſt of all that call themſelves Chriſtians, to be careful in avoiding theſe Inconveniences, which do ill ſuit with that Name; and moſt eſpecially it ſeems to be the Concern of all <hi>Pulpits,</hi> of what ſort ſoever, to ſee that the <hi>Spirit</hi> that moves there, ſhould be only that of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> For if once it be permitted, that in thoſe Sacred Places there be acceſs for <hi>Intereſt, Affection, Prejudice</hi> or <hi>Paſſion,</hi> &amp;c. and that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins from thence enforc'd to the People, be not only according to the Dictates of the Holy Ghoſt, but likewiſe what is ſuggeſted from the <hi>Information</hi> and <hi>Narratives</hi> of ſuch <hi>vile</hi> Men; 'twill bring all Preaching into a Diſrepute, and give too plauſible an Occaſion to <hi>Atheiſts</hi> of ridiculing all Religion.</p>
               <p>Will it not be a Temptation likewiſe to Thinking Men, to have a leſs value for thoſe Chairs, when they find them ſubject to theſe Infirmities: when they ſee them lie as open to <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Railing</hi> and ſuch like Weakneſſes, as <hi>other Places,</hi> which for that Reaſon are eſteem'd <hi>Prophane?</hi> Men are willing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, where they truſt their Conſciences, to find ſomething above the ordinary Maſs, ſome more than ordinary Sanctity, a ſteddy Conduct, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over the common Frailties and Temptations of other Ranks, and ſuch other like Qualities, which may naturally work a Confidence in Men, and be as Arguments to convince them, that the Spirit that there moves is above Nature, and capable of direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

others in order to Vertue and Truth. But where they find not Men thus Qualifi'd, when they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience thoſe, who pretend to be <hi>Guides,</hi> to fall in with the <hi>Mobile,</hi> to be expos'd to their Levities, ſo as to take Fire at every Flaſh; when they ſee them inſtill Jealouſies, look Grim and Soure, Roar, Ramp, and Inſult over the Oppreſſed; 'twill only breed a Diſeſteem of them in the Obſervers, and put them upon thinking, that however they may go to Church to Hear for faſhion ſake; yet to rely upon ſuch Mens Directions will not be very ſafe, whilſt they ſee them go to the <hi>Bar</hi> for their <hi>Doctrins,</hi> and fetch their Proofs more out of the <hi>Law</hi> than the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>

               <p>But above all, 'tis not fit Preachers ſhould run out into theſe Cruel Extravagances; becauſe, if after the <hi>Preaching</hi> up ſuch <hi>Accuſations</hi> and <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Crimes</hi> taken up againſt Men at the <hi>Bar,</hi> it ſhould prove that the <hi>Informers</hi> were <hi>Villains,</hi> and the <hi>Accuſed</hi> appear <hi>Innocent,</hi> what a Reflection would this prove upon ſuch <hi>Teachers,</hi> and upon their Religion; when it ſhall be manifeſt to the World, that They have Preach'd up ſo many noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Lies</hi> in their <hi>Pulpits,</hi> have aſſerted the Truth of them, have ſpread ſo many unjuſt <hi>Calumnies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Neighbor, have Expounded <hi>Libels</hi> and <hi>Narratives</hi> inſtead of <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and been as poſitive in ſuch Doctrins of <hi>Perjur'd Knights of the Poſt,</hi> as if they had been deliver'd by the <hi>Evangeliſts?</hi> And if theſe Preachers happen to be Men of <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> will it not, do you think, be a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to their inward Peace, when they ſee the Men, they have ſo ſeverely traduc'd from their

                  <hi>Pulpits,</hi> and blackn'd with the Fouleſt Crimes; to be <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Innocent;</hi> and that thoſe Villanies they ſo poſitively laid to their charge, prove only <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> and <hi>Malicious Forgeries?</hi> What a damp muſt this be upon their Souls, when they conſider how <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> they have been in wronging the <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> in atteſting <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Perjuries,</hi> and promoting the Devil's Cauſe inſtead of God's? How will thoſe Characters they have given of their Neighbor in their <hi>Sermons,</hi> look Ghaſtly and Tormenting, when they reflect upon them; when they conſider how they have proclaim'd them Guilty of an <hi>Execrable and Horrid Plot; Of Inſolence and implacable Malice; Of want of Piety and Humanity; Of a Helliſh Plot; Of its being upon the Point of being Executed, for the Subverſion of the Religion and Government; Of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to themſelves the moſt Beneficial Places both in Church and State; Of a Dangerous Plot, deeply laid againſt the Life of the King, againſt the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, for horrid Maſſacres, and the utmoſt rage of Perſecution; Of being blood thirſty and deceitful Men, engag'd in a Helliſh Plot, for Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinating our King, and Subverſion of our Government and Religion; Of being Traitors and Murderers, a Generation of Vipers; Of being the Spawn of the Devil, deſigning Helliſh Plots and Contrivances for the ſetting up of Anarchy and Tyranny; Of being Devils of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Faction, of Treaſon and Rebellion,</hi> &amp;c.

and ſo Impudent, as to boaſt of it when it was done.</p>

               <p>There might be evil Inſtruments in this <note place="margin">H.

There could never therefore be a fitter Time for them to conſute theſe bold Predictions, nor any Confutation, that in all probability would more affect the World, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage their Cauſe, than to cauſe <hi>London</hi> to fall, juſt then when it expected <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould; and it hath been ſaid, how they have glory'd and triumph'd in this thing.

ſuch Counſel not pitch'd upon.—Such things as theſe are now become their laſt Refuge, it ſeems; and the Arguments in which (I am perſuaded) they expect moſt Succeſs: they find how miſerably fruitleſs all Rational Attempts againſt us are, and how they ſtill recoil againſt themſelves; and they deſpair of ever convincing us like Men, and therefore are reſolv'd to beat out our Brains (if they can) like Beaſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If there be a Popular Rumor, that <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in Diſguiſe inſinuate themſelves among <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and from their <hi>Pulpits</hi> Preach to them Schiſm and Sedition; it do's not look Rational that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhould be made a <hi>Sermon-Diſcourſe,</hi> preach'd up as a <hi>Truth,</hi> unleſs upon ſurer Grounds than a <hi>Report,</hi> or the Aſſurance, that <hi>ſuch a one knows the Perſon that ſaw the Man beyond Sea that did it.</hi> And therefore how <hi>

               <p>It is their Buſineſs and Endeavor to keep <note place="margin">J.

By ſuch Arts as theſe they inſinuate themſelves among the poor deluded People of our Separate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and joyning with them in their

Clamors againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it down for Superſtitious and Popiſhly affected, they paſs there for Gifted Brethren, and real Popery is carry'd on by ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes.</p>
               <p>Preachers, I think, ought to be very Cautious, how they carry up ſuch kind of <hi>Stories</hi> as theſe into the <hi>Pulpits;</hi> becauſe, tho' there may be Grounds enough to make them a <hi>Table</hi> or <hi>Coffee-houſe</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe; yet ſcarce enough to qualifie them for a <hi>Sermon,</hi> or to make them a fit Attendance for a <hi>Text</hi> out of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> I am for having nothing have admittance into the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> beſides what is certainly and unqueſtionably True: That Place ought to be kept Sacred, and nothing have acceſs there, that is Prophane, or in any likelihood may prove to be a <hi>Lie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis neceſſary this Caution be obſerv'd, that ſo all Preachers and Sermons be maintain'd in their Juſt Authority and Reſpect. For nothing can more contribute to the leſſening their Reputation with the People, than to hear <hi>Vulgar Rumors, Ill-grounded Stories, Peeviſh Jealouſies,</hi> held forth, and as paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately defended by them, as if they had been <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd Truths.</hi> What Reſpect can I poſſibly have for a <hi>Preacher,</hi> that makes no better choice of what he delivers? Is it likely he ſhould prevail upon my Underſtanding or Will, that ſuffers himſelf to be impos'd on? When I go to Church, I expect to hear the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Solid Truths</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to me, as may be a Comfort to my Soul,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64141:16"/>
and direct my Steps in the ways of Bliſs. But if with a light Sprinkle of this, I am put off with <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Invectives,</hi> and a Relation of ſuch Stories, as I am confident, the <hi>Preacher</hi> knows no more the Truth of than my ſelf; I cannot but be Scandaliz'd, and begin to fear, that ſuch an one is better conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in the <hi>News</hi> of the Town, than in the <hi>Sacred Text</hi> or <hi>Fathers;</hi> and me-thinks, it has ſo much the Reliſh and Air of a <hi>Coffee-houſe,</hi> that I cannot but look about me, to ſee where we are. And now if People ſhould once ſeriouſly reflect on this, and conſider with what <hi>empty Stories</hi> Preachers content themſelves, for the patching up their Sermons, it cannot chooſe but raiſe a great Prejudice in their Minds, and diſcourage them from relying much upon their <hi>Teachers,</hi> whilſt they ſee them either ſo very <hi>Credulous,</hi> in thus taking up every <hi>Vulgar Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> for a <hi>Truth;</hi> or very <hi>Inſincere,</hi> in delivering that to their Auditory, which they don't believe themſelves. Either of which is a very ill Quality to recommend a Miniſter to his Congregation.</p>
               <p>Upon which Score I cannot but heartily deſire all Preachers, of what ſort ſoever, to take this into a ſerious Conſideration, and to be very careful in the Choice of the Matter and Hiſtory, which they deliver to their People. I conjure them by their <hi>Sacred Function,</hi> by the <hi>Goſpel</hi> they expound, by the <hi>Truth</hi> they pretend to; that they would think of nothing but <hi>Truth,</hi> that they would preach up nothing but <hi>Truth,</hi> and conſequently that they would deliver nothing in their <hi>Sermons</hi> for a <hi>Truth,</hi> which may be a <hi>Lie</hi> for all as they know. This I preſs the more earneſtly, becauſe I am ſenſible how
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64141:17"/>
much <hi>Preachers</hi> may loſe themſelves for want of this Care. For beſides the <hi>Offence</hi> againſt God, and the <hi>Wrong</hi> they may do their <hi>Neighbor,</hi> 'tis certain they ruin their own <hi>Reputation.</hi> 'Tis no ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon a Preacher, when it is with Truth ſaid of him, that inſtead of teaching the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in Meekneſs, he has preach'd up <hi>Lies</hi> in a Paſſion. Every Man ought to be true in his Way; and if he that puts off <hi>Counterfeit</hi> Wares in his <hi>Shop</hi> for <hi>True</hi> ones, muſt of Neceſſity paſs for a <hi>Cheat;</hi> how cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect is it neceſſary every <hi>Preacher</hi> ſhould be, whilſt to him his <hi>Pulpit</hi> is his <hi>Shop;</hi> and the Injury, if done there, is the more conſiderable, by how much the Affairs of the Soul and Eternity, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Concerns of this World?</p>
               <p>And as theſe kind of Stories do not ſuit well with the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> ſo neither do they agree with a <hi>Dedicatory Epiſtle,</hi> eſpecially from a <hi>Faithful Paſtor</hi> addreſſing himſelf to his <hi>Pariſhioners:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Dr. <hi>Teniſon,</hi> making Apology for his <note place="margin">

When he makes this Apology, I ſay, for his peeviſh and ſevere Language to a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> he do's not ſeem to do the Office of a <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Faithful Paſtor;</hi> for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64141:17"/>

Beſides, his conceiving an Hatred againſt a <hi>whole Body</hi> of Men, for the ſake of <hi>one ſuppos'd Member</hi> thereof, and being fill'd with <hi>Suſpicion</hi> and <hi>Jealouſie</hi> againſt them <hi>all,</hi> upon his ſcore; which is a piece of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> fitly to be retaliated by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> if they ſhould be Jealous of every <hi>Parſon</hi> they met, for fear he ſhould by <hi>Perjury</hi> Swear them to the <hi>Gallows,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one of that <hi>Coat</hi> help'd Five of their Brethren, not out of their <hi>Livings,</hi> but out of their Lives, moſt infamouſly and barbarouſly, not in the laſt Age but only Seven Years ago; beſides the ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſinuation into his Pariſhioners, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he Diſcours'd with, was a <hi>Hypocrit</hi> and a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler,</hi> ſomething of the <hi>like nature</hi> with his own Father's old Friend, and by this vile and undeſerv'd Character, raiſing a Prejudice in the Minds of his Readers, that being thus prepoſſeſs'd, they might the eaſier give the Doctor the Victory over his Antagoniſt, whom they had found knock'd down in the very firſt Leaf with a Calumny.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, I ſay, is it not a very uncharitable Preſumption in the Doctor, thus by Inſinuation to make a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> of that <hi>Oubbard,</hi> who ſucceeded his

Father, and Preaching up <hi>Purgatory</hi> prov'd an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrit</hi> and <hi>Diſſembler?</hi> Do's the Doctor know he was a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> that he ſo confidently, not now in the Heat of Diſpute, but in the cooler management of his Pen, expoſes all the Body of <hi>Juſuits,</hi> as infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, to his Pariſhioners, upon his ſcore? Is he certain he was a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> that now he ſerves up this Story to confirm his Flock, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, become <hi>Teachers</hi> to the <hi>Diſſenters?</hi> If the Doctor knows it to be a Truth, 'tis more than he has yet made appear; for all as I ſee in the Story, as he has told it, 'tis as likely he was a <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland Diſſembler,</hi> as a <hi>Jeſuit.</hi> Don't every body know, there's many a <hi>Church of England Divine</hi> has had <hi>Popery</hi> enough in them, to be mark'd for <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its,,</hi> and to be cenſur'd and turn'd out for ſuch, by the Men that made up the <hi>Committee</hi> in thoſe Days? What if Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> had Preach'd to ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation his Doctrin of <hi>Praying for the Dead,</hi> and requeſted of them (as he did in his Will) that they would <hi>Pray for his Soul,</hi> when departed? Don't the Doctor think, that he had ſaid enough of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> to have been caſhier'd by the <hi>Committee,</hi> and outed for a <hi>Papiſt?</hi> If M. <hi>Montague</hi> had deliver'd there his Opinion of the uſe of <hi>Images,</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> of <hi>Traditions,</hi> of admitting the <hi>Pope</hi> for Arbitrator in Controverſie, &amp;c. would not they as certainly have caſt him by for a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as they did <hi>Gubbard?</hi> So that, I believe, if the Doctor will ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the Point, he'll find, that many <hi>Church-of-England-men</hi> have had <hi>Popery</hi> enough in them to have been turn'd out in thoſe Times for <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and to have paſs'd for ſo many <hi>Gubbards.</hi> This I ſay as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64141:18"/>
to his <hi>Popery;</hi> and as to his <hi>pretending a Kindneſs to their Cauſe,</hi> 'tis more likely again he was a <hi>Church of England Divine</hi> than a <hi>Jeſuit;</hi> whilſt 'tis well known, what the <hi>Church-Divines</hi> did at that Time for <hi>Livings:</hi> of the Ten thouſand Benefic'd Men, there being many hundreds, that comply'd with the Times, whether really or pretendedly, let the Doctor determine. If he can ſhew only <hi>Five Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its</hi> that did as much, 'twill be more than ever was done yet; and if he ſhould, 'twill be ſtill, I believe, a thouſand to one, that his Friend <hi>Gubbard</hi> was a <hi>Church of England Divine,</hi> rather than a <hi>Jeſuit.</hi> And yet the Doctor will have him to be nothing but a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> he's ſtill angry at the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> for his ſake; and he tells his Pariſhioners the occaſion of it, that this wrought upon him when he was young, and he cannot yet wear it off; but I hope there are ſome amongſt them that will have ſo much compaſſion on him, as to be ſorry, that in all this time the <hi>Doctor</hi> has not worn out the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his <hi>Childhood:</hi> for my part, I am ſorry to find ſuch a malicious Story ſet forth by a <hi>Paſtor</hi> to his <hi>Pariſhioners,</hi> and that he has ſo little Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Charity, as to expoſe the Reputation of ſo great a Body, under the black Colours of <hi>Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> upon ſuch a bare Preſumption. Would the Doctor like well to be thus ſerv'd; and that He and his Brethren ſhould be thus trampl'd upon, upon ſuch ſlight Imaginations? Theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, I know, ſerve well enough, to keep faſt the People, and to make them averſe to the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> But I hope thoſe whom the Doctor has endeavor'd to make appear as <hi>Hypocrits,</hi> will ſhew themſelves
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64141:19"/>
Men of better Conſciences, than to follow him in ſo ill an Example. But let us now proceed to our Cautions.</p>

               <p>THAT if any Preacher be zealous to prevent his Flock from going over to any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which he judges to be Erroneous; he would be careful, not to uſe any Inſincere or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Means, for the working this Effect: That he would not be ſo Paſſionately earneſt in the diſcouraging his People from ſuch a Change, as to forget both <hi>Honeſty, Juſtice, Truth</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> while he's Warm in his Diſſuaſives.

I cannot therefore but adviſe all ſorts of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in caſe they fear their Congregation may be ſeiz'd with Doubts, and tempted to leave their Communion, that they would ſeek other ſorts of Arguments to Secure and Settle them. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe kind of Ungentile Satyrs, may perhaps rid them of a great many Uneaſineſſes, and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Pangs of Conſcience; yet I cannot think the Method to be Apoſtolical. 'Twould certainly be more according to the Spirit of the Goſpel, to Preach nothing but <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> to be <hi>Meek</hi> and <hi>Moderate,</hi> and <hi>Peaceable;</hi> to ſpread no <hi>Calumnies,</hi> inculcate no <hi>Falſities,</hi> to <hi>exaggerate</hi> nothing, to <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue</hi> nothing, to make no <hi>Falſe Inferences,</hi> and <hi>Half-Deſcriptions;</hi> and as not to encourage or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at Vice, ſo neither to practiſe it in the way of Preaching againſt it. 'Tis very Ridiculous to ſee a Man doing the very thing he condemns; to hear a Man pronouncing Sentence againſt <hi>Equivocating</hi> and <hi>Lying,</hi> with an <hi>Equivocation</hi> or <hi>Lie</hi> in his Mouth: To hear another condemning <hi>Cruelty,</hi> and at the ſame time inſpiring his Auditory with Blood and Revenge: To hear a Third reproving ſome Principles to be the <hi>Doctrin of Devils,</hi> with ſuch Arguments, as require the aſſiſtance of a <hi>Fiend</hi> at the <hi>Elbow.</hi> Theſe, I ſay, and ſuch like, are very Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; and therefore I look upon it more beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all Pretenders to the Goſpel, to avoid all ſuch indirect and unjuſt Means.

So noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſo hateful were their Practices, till at length all that befel the Nation, was ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ariſe from thence; ſo general was the Odium of that Name, that like a common Thief, every Felony, by whomſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, is charg'd upon them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any Doctor, I ſay, ſhould in this manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Preacher ought to be careful, when he Prints his Sermon, not to Dedicate it to his Sovereign, a Member of that Communion. For certainly, a Sermon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64141:35"/>
the Church and Religion of <hi>Catholics,</hi> of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, Cheating,</hi> of being Hateful and Odious, do's not ſeem very fit for the Patronage of a <hi>Catholic King.</hi> I think there can be no greater Affront, than for a <hi>Preacher</hi> thus to expoſe his <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Religion</hi> under all the hateful Forms that can be, and then to deſire his <hi>Prince's Protection</hi> for the Infamy he has caſt upon it. This is juſt as if he ſhould ſay to him, <hi>May it pleaſe your Majeſty, I have Abus'd and Ridicul'd your Religion behind your back to your Subjects; and now I am come to do it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain before your Face, and I expect you ſhall uphold me in it.</hi> What greater piece of Confidence and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption can there be than this? 'Tis a thing not to be ventur'd on to a <hi>Subject,</hi> tho' but of a middle Rank; for who is there ſo Phlegmatic amongſt them all, that can hear his Religion derided and render'd odious, and think himſelf oblig'd by the <hi>Abuſe?</hi> I am confident at leaſt, there's no Preacher whatſoever, would take it for a Complement, to have his People and Perſuaſion made Contemptible in Print, and then to have a Preſent made to him of the Satyr. What a Raſhneſs then muſt it needs be, to do this to a Prince? Is it to be thought, he has not as much Kindneſs for his Religion, as any <hi>Gown-man</hi> for his? Can he ſpend ſo many Hours in Prayer, be ſo Exemplary Pious in his Devotions, and ſo Exact in all Obſervances of his Church, and after all take it kindly to ſee his Church vilifi'd and contemn'd? At leaſt, can it enter into the Heart of any Rational Man, that a Prince who has ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded Three Kingdoms for his Religion, ſhould be welcom'd to his Crown with the Preſent of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64141:36"/>
in which his Religion is thus expos'd to the Scorn of all his Subjects? Certainly none can be ſo abſurdly ſtupid. I hope therefore there's no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of enforcing this Caution with any farther Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, the improbability of the Attempt making that needleſs.</p>
               <p>Neither would it be a Piece of much better Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if a Prince of the <hi>Catholic Communion</hi> being come to the Crown, and having call'd a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to Settle the Affairs of the Nation, a Doctor of another Communion ſhould in theſe Terms Hold-forth to the Members of the Lower Houſe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I would deſire you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That 'tis a <hi>Church-of-England Loyalty</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dr. Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock <hi>to the Commons, May</hi> 29. 1685. <hi>pag.</hi> 31, 32.</note> I perſuade you to; <hi>This</hi> our King Approves, Commends, Relies on, as a Try'd and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd <hi>Loyalty,</hi> which has Suffer'd with its Prince, but never yet Rebell'd againſt him; A <hi>Loyalty</hi> upon firm and ſteddy Principles, and without Reſerve. And therefore to keep us true to our Prince, we muſt be true to our <hi>Church,</hi> and to our <hi>Religion.</hi> It is no Act of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> to Accommodate or Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment away our <hi>Religion,</hi> and its Legal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities; for if we change our <hi>Religion,</hi> we muſt change the Principles of our <hi>Loyalty</hi> too, and, I am ſure, the King and the Crown will gain nothing by that; for there is no
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64141:36"/>
Laſting and Immoveable <hi>Loyalty</hi> as that of the <hi>Church of England.—</hi>I deny not, but ſome who are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in ſome Junctures of Affairs, may, and have been very <hi>Loyal;</hi> but, I am ſure, the <hi>Popiſh Religion</hi> is not; the <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> may be <hi>Loyal,</hi> but not the <hi>Papiſt;</hi> And yet there can be no ſecurity of thoſe Men's <hi>Loyalty,</hi> whoſe <hi>Religion</hi> in any Caſe teaches them to Rebel.</p>
               <p>If any Doctor ſhould Hold-forth, I ſay, in theſe Terms, 'twould not be a Piece of the beſt Manners; Becauſe there can be no greater Rudeneſs in the World, than for a Miniſter thus abuſively to Reflect upon his <hi>Prince,</hi> and to tell his <hi>Subjects,</hi> that they have a <hi>Sovereign,</hi> whoſe <hi>Religion teaches to Rebel.</hi> What greater Affront can there poſſibly be offer'd to a <hi>Crown'd Head,</hi> than to be thus vilely expos'd to his own Subjects, and by a <hi>Subject</hi> too? 'Tis certain, to a <hi>Generous</hi> and <hi>Noble-Hearted Prince,</hi> who knows how to value his <hi>Word,</hi> and makes Conſcience of his <hi>Duty,</hi> nothing can be no more Diſpleaſing, than to hear of <hi>Falſe-heartedneſs, Treachery</hi> and <hi>Diſloyalty;</hi> to hear of it, I ſay, even in Subjects, muſt of neceſſity be Odious to him: and what muſt it be, when his own <hi>Subjects</hi> are aſſur'd from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> that even He himſelf profeſſes a <hi>Religion,</hi> which encourages <hi>Diſloyalty,</hi> and in ſome Caſes, even teaches to <hi>Rebel?</hi> Can a Prince who has an Abhorrence to Treachery and Diſloyalty, be pleas'd to hear, that what he ſo much deteſts in others, is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64141:37"/>
found in the <hi>Religion,</hi> he nouriſhes with in his own Breaſt? Certainly, next to the Striking at his Crown, as nothing can be more Diſreſpectful, ſo nothing can be more Offenſive than this. Beſides, muſt not a Prince be very ſenſible of ſuch kind of <hi>Mockery</hi> in Preaching, whilſt his Subjects are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd to be Loyal, but with an Argument in the Cloſe, which is enough to blow a Trumpet to Rebellion: For what more powerful Argument to ill-deſigning Men, than to have this Aſſurance of the Religion of the Prince?</p>
               <p>And then again, when a Prince has call'd a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> in order to a Settlement of the Affairs of the Nation, what a kind of good Subject muſt he be, who in this manner ſets himſelf to raiſe an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in the Hearts of this Aſſembly againſt their Prince, by expoſing his Religion under ſo vile a Character, that 'tis impoſſible, where the Charge is believ'd to True, to entertain very kind Thougts for any that is a Profeſſor of ſuch Unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principles? 'Tis well known, that when a <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> meet, 'tis the <hi>Sovereign</hi>'s Deſire, there ſhould be a mutual good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imſelf and that Council; and that none can more affront the Prince, than to raiſe Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies in their Heads, and diſturb their Minds with Foul Idea's touching Himſelf and his Religion: What need then of further Arguments to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſuch kind of Preaching; ſince, however it may ſound big of being <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>True to the King,</hi> it do's notwithſtanding work the quite contrary Effect, and even anſwer the Wiſhes of the moſt wicked Enemies of the Crown?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:64141:37"/>
In this manner it injures Him as <hi>Sovereign;</hi> and were there nothing of this in it; yet muſt it be very unwelcome to him, to hear ſuch a Character of the <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>his own Communion,</hi> that there can be <hi>no Security in their Loyalty;</hi> ſince being but newly come to the Crown, he cannot but remember, that 'tis but a little time ſince he was a <hi>Subject</hi> himſelf. And how near this comes to his own <hi>Perſon,</hi> let every one conſider. I meddle here nothing with the Controverſie; but I believe, that all <hi>Honeſt Men,</hi> that know how hearty a Lover this our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign is of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> and how <hi>Sincere</hi> in his <hi>Religion,</hi> need no other Argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him a Calumniator, who has thus Aſpers'd his Religion, and ſet it forth as <hi>Diſloyal,</hi> and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rebel:</hi> Since if it <hi>really</hi> were ſo whoſoever profeſs'd a Love to it, and <hi>Loyalty</hi> together, muſt of neceſſity be a <hi>Diſſembler</hi> on the one Side or the other; there being no poſſibility of being <hi>heartily Loyal,</hi> and yet be <hi>True</hi> to a <hi>Church,</hi> which teaches to <hi>Rebel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that remains here worthy of Conſideration, is, whether it be <hi>Wiſe</hi> or <hi>Mannerly</hi> for <hi>Preachers,</hi> to make their <hi>Prince's Religion Odious</hi> and <hi>Contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to his <hi>Subjects,</hi> tho they make no <hi>Dedications</hi> of it, or do not Preach it to a <hi>Parliament-Houſe?</hi> The Reaſons for the Doubt are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it do's not look like the part of a good <hi>Subject,</hi> to undervalue his <hi>Prince</hi> to his own <hi>People.</hi> And yet he that inveighs againſt his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſeems to do ſo: For when ſuch and ſuch Points of his <hi>Faith</hi> are painted out and condemn'd as <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, Nonſenſe, Prophane, Impious, the Effects of</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:64141:38"/>
                  <hi>Madneſs, full of Contradictions, contrary to Senſe and Reaſon, Charms, Hocus-pocus, Cheats, groſs Idolatry, worſe and more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nnatural than that of Barbarians and Pagans.</hi> Are not all theſe moſt ſevere Reflections upon his <hi>Senſe,</hi> his <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Reaſon?</hi> Whilſt He being ſuppos'd to approve and embrace all thoſe <hi>Tenets,</hi> that are ſtampt with theſe Ignominious and Unworthy Titles, is at the ſame time ſuppos'd not to know the difference between <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Nonſenſe, Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Contradictions, Judgment</hi> and <hi>Madneſs, Chriſtianity</hi> and <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and eſpecially when after theſe Black Characters this Concluſion brings up, <hi>Theſe things are ſo Plain, that any Man of Senſe, any Child may ſee it.</hi> Is not this within one Step of rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of that Communion in the Liſt of Madmen or Fools? It leaves 'em all, at leaſt, at the Mercy of the Congregation, by their <hi>Inferring Faculty,</hi> to make what they pleaſe of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe ſuch a way of Preaching Reflects upon the <hi>Government</hi> of their Sovereign. The Reaſon is evident; becauſe when They ſet forth the Religion of their Prince, as teaching and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Uſurpation, Tyranny, Maſſacres, all ſorts of Cruelty and Treachery, of introducing Slavery, and making no Conſcience of any thing that is for the Intereſt of Mother-Church: This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fills the Subjects with <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies,</hi> makes them uneaſie under ſuch a Government, and indiſpoſes them for giving a <hi>hearty</hi> Service to ſuch a Prince, who, they are made to fear, intends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better for them, than <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Slavery.</hi> Whoſoever conſiders the Temper of this Nation, how ſuſceptible the People are of Fears, how jealous
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64141:38"/>
of their Liberty, how credulous at the Noiſe of Plots and Deſigns; cannot but know, how far a Hint or ſly Inſinuation will go with them; and that one <hi>Innuendo,</hi> that touches upon the right String, will ſet them more in a Ferment, than open Danger will do any other Nation in the World. 'Tis ſtrange, how ſenſibly the Noiſe of a <hi>Cloud,</hi> or a <hi>Storm,</hi> or a <hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> works upon them, tho' in the Quiet of a general Calm: To talk to them of <hi>Patience, Non-reſiſtance, of being ready to ſuffer all that God ſhall permit for their Sins,</hi> is to fill their Heads with <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Fagots;</hi> and a Word of <hi>Slavery</hi> carries their Fancies into the middle of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now when a People is thus diſpos'd, how can thoſe <hi>Preachers</hi> be good <hi>Subjects,</hi> who cannot get ſix Steps above their Congregation, but immediately they diſcover <hi>Clouds</hi> hanging over the People's Heads, they fright them with <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Tempeſts,</hi> and then pretending to allay their Fears with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of <hi>Have but Patience, be ready to ſuffer, all this will blow over,</hi> they fright them ten times worſe than before, and ſlily improve their <hi>Comforts</hi> into a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Storm?</hi> Now what kind of <hi>Subjects</hi> muſt theſe be, and how wonderfully <hi>Loyal,</hi> that by theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances and ſubtle Inſinuations, can fill his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's People with as much <hi>Diſturbance,</hi> and render them as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neaſie</hi> under the moſt benign Influence of a Gracious and Indulgent Prince, as if they had the heavy Weight of <hi>Tyranny</hi> galling their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? I know the Pretence is <hi>Religion,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferve them from <hi>Error:</hi> and 'tis no more than a Pretence; for 'tis certain, Men may be taught to be <hi>Good Chriſtians,</hi> without being made <hi>Bad Subjects;</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:64141:39"/>
and the diſturbing the Government, is no neceſſary Preparation for directing People the Way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Reſignation</hi> may be eaſily taught without the help of <hi>Storms;</hi> the Scripture furniſhes Matter and Examples enough without going up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Clouds.</hi> And I wiſh this <hi>Modern</hi> way of teaching <hi>Patience,</hi> be not a new kind of <hi>Pulpit-Drum</hi> to alarm People into the Spirit of Rebellion.</p>
               <p>I would not be for raiſing Scandals againſt any Society of Men much leſs againſt thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Goſpel. But when I ſee the Effects of ſuch kind of Preaching, how it raiſes <hi>Diſcontents</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies,</hi> and becomes an Aggrievance to the Prince, I cannot but wiſh, that ſuch as follow this Method, and <hi>intend</hi> the Miſchief, were more <hi>Loyal;</hi> and ſuch as <hi>intend it not,</hi> were more <hi>Wiſe.</hi> Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, I am ſure the Method is unwarrantable, and not at all becoming thoſe, who would willingly be thought the <hi>Beſt Preachers</hi> in the World, and the <hi>Beſt Subjects.</hi>
