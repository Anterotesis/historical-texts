            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

In which diſcourſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready extant, (gentle Readers) you have underſtood how the Emperor <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſo loved and honoured Knights er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, that from the furtheſt parts of the world they came to his Court, becauſe yearly he continued a ſumptuous ſpectacle in form of a Tourney, for the exerciſe of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and military diſcipline: And with ſuch religious zeal was this worthy practiſe followed, that the Court might well be called the School of Arms, and Nurſe of civility. For this cauſe, many Kings Princes, and great Lords, ſent their ſons to be there educated among whom the good Knight <hi>Fryſol</hi> King of <hi>Hungaria</hi> ſent one of his, named <hi>Belcar,</hi> and the Duke <hi>Euſtace</hi> of <hi>Mecaena</hi> another, called <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos</hi>; that they might deſerve their Knighthood at the hand of the Emperour the true mirror and <hi>Idea</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and ſo conſequently they to participate ſome part of his bounty and proweſſe.</p>
               <p>The time then being come that <hi>Belcar</hi> ſon to King <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſol</hi> ſhould receive his order of Knighthood, he humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Emperour that he might enjoy it at his hand; and <hi>Tirendos</hi> ſon to Duke <hi>Euſtace</hi> of <hi>Mecaena,</hi> deſirous of the ſelf ſame honour, made the like requeſt unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: Whereto the good Emperour (who loved them both with ſingular affection, knowing how well Chivalry would be imployed by them) right willingly condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, after they had performed the accuſtomed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, he knighted theſe two Princes with great royalty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52643:6"/>
God to beſtow ſuch favour on them, as at no time they might degenerate from their famous predeceſſors. And to <hi>Belcar,</hi> embracing him in his arms, he ſaid, My good Nephew, heaven accompliſh in you ſuch perfections of manhood, as each one may know you to be the ſon of the worthy Knight Sir <hi>Fryſol,</hi> a Prince ſo hardy and valiant, as any that ever followed Arms. The ceremonies being ended, they all returned to the Pallace, where the new Knights being unarmed, rich Robes and Mantles were brought them, for the greater honour of the feaſt, which in the Court at this time excéeded. But <hi>Belcar</hi> took little pleaſure in beholding the divers occurrences at this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, becauſe his mind mas more buſied with expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of future glorie, which made him thus to commune with himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Belcar</hi> thou haſt now no longer time to reſt, ſéeing thou haſt received the honourable order of Knighthood, and that at the hands of the Emperour thine Vncle, whom the divine providence hath indued with ſo many laudable vertues: nor doth any thing want in the King thy father, that is required in a man at arms. If then hitherto thou haſt lived in pleaſures and delights, henceforth thou muſt bequeath thy ſelf to travell, to ſhew that thou doeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in ſome things thy Anceſtors, who with great labour have attained ſuch fame and renown, as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory thereof ſhall remain immortal. And if thou wilt not darken this honour, then muſt thou haſten thy depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and follow the ſearch of ſtrange adventures, as they did in their dayes for thine exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>After many and ſundry thoughts that fought together within his ſpirit he concluded to depart accompanied but with one Squire, and that ſo ſecretly as could be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Thence would he travell directly towards Macedon, to make the firſt proof of his valour in the adventure of <hi>Francelina,</hi> who was inchanted in the Iſle of Carderia, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52643:7"/>
was declared in the hiſtory of <hi>Palmerin di Oliva.</hi> And at this time was little talk of any other thing, then of the number of Knights that daily ſought to win her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and with her the Kingdome of <hi>Theſſaly</hi>: for ſuch was the promiſed guerdon and recompence, to him that could deliver her out of the inchanted Caſtle, but hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Knights loſt their labour, for none was able to finiſh the adventure. <hi>Belcar</hi> being earneſtly provoked with the fame of this occaſion, which was generally repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtrange and full of danger, reſolved to frame his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney thither, becauſe he earneſtly deſired to bring the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment to end: his reaſon herein not to be diſallowed for beyond the atchievement of great honour and praiſe, he ſhould be endued with ſo fair a Princeſſe, as could not he judged inferiour to any. In this ſurpaſſing deſire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from any one but himſelf, in regard of his perfect hope to compaſſe the ſame: thrée daies he honoured the feaſt with his preſence, and the fourth day early in the morning putting on a ruſty gréen armour, which for this purpoſe he had ſecretly provided, carrying likewiſe in his Shéeld for his deviſe, a Caſtle Gules in a field Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, unſéen of any, he left the city, riding on toward the realm of <hi>Macedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour ſoon after underſtanding hereof, was not a little glad of his worthy enterpriſe, which he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed in the preſence of all his Lords and Barons, ſaying. So help me God, as my opinion and hope is perſwaded, that <hi>Belcar</hi> will ſo honourably follow arms, as each of you will rejoice to hear the diſcourſe of his fortunes: heaven further and favour his attempts, directing all his actions in ſuch ſort, as no tongue may controle his noble forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Belcars</hi> departure was liked of every one, except <hi>Tirendos</hi> who was thereat marvellouſly offended, becauſe he had not acquainted him with his intent, for gladly would he have born him company, and therefore he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined never to give over travell till he found him, as it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52643:7"/>
came to paſſe very ſoon after. In mean while, <hi>Belcar</hi> made ſuch ſpéed in his journey, as without meeting any adventure to hinder him, in ſhort time he attained the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and confines of the Empire: and entring the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Macedon,</hi> that night he was lodged in the Caſtle of an old curteous Knight, who fitting at his gate, and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Belcar</hi> paſſe by in the evening, ſomewhat late, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for that night to let him be his Hoſt, which he not willing to refuſe, was well content to accept his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. After that <hi>Belcar</hi> was unarmed, the old Knight ſo well liked his brave conſtitution of body, his affable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and modeſt ſpéeches, as he had great pleaſure to ſit and talk with him, and falling from one circumſtance to another, the good old Knight perceived in the end, that his gueſt was one in great favour with the Emperour <hi>Palmerin.</hi>

               <p>Now muſt I let you underſtand, that this courteous old Knight had thrée ſons, by nature proud and evil diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, envying the liberal hoſpitality which their father uſed to travelling paſſengers; wherefore the good old man, too well acquainted with their malicious behaviour, took them aſide to admoniſh them, that they ſhould uſe no frowning or diſcourteſie to his gueſt. Know my ſons, quoth he, that this night we have in our houſe one of the Emperors Knights, whoſe countenance doth witneſſe that he is of high deſcent: I pray you therefore do him all the honour you may, entertaining him with chearfull and hearty good will, not uſing any ſpéeches, but ſuch as are modeſt &amp; meet for Gentlemen. They anſwered that they would fulfil his commandement; yet their father was no ſooner gone, but they concluded altogether on the morrow to aſſail <hi>Belcar</hi> at the entrance of a Forreſt, which was not far diſtant from the Caſtle, to try if he were ſuch a man as their father commended him to be: and being thus reſolved, they would not be ſéen at ſupper, but early in the morning claſping on their Armour, they rode to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52643:8"/>
place of their appointment. The reverend father ſéeing the ingratitude and diſobedience of his ſons, did all the honour he poſſibly could to <hi>Belcar</hi>; who requiting his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe with many thanks in the morning ſet forward on his journey: And ſcarcely had he ridden two leagues but he met the thrée brethren under a wood ſide, when the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of them came to him with theſe ſpéeches. Sir Knight you muſt of neceſſity Iuſt with me, otherwiſe your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage may not be permitted, for now I am deſirous to make proof if thou be ſo valiant as men do eſtéem thée. <hi>Belcar,</hi> who ſtood in doubt of a greater ambuſh, took his Lance from his Squire, and in very courteous manner thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. You may be aſhamed, Sir Knight, to aſſail any Gentleman belonging to the Emperour in this ſort, and happily you may deal with ſuch a one, who ſhall give you but little time to ſit down and repent ye. Trouble not your mind with ſuch imaginations (quoth another of the brethren) but prepare your ſelf to try the event. At which words they fetched their carréer, and encountred together with ſuch vigour, as their Lances flew in ſhivers up into the ayre, <hi>Belcar</hi> being not moved in his ſaddle, where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wiſe he gave his enemy ſuch a puiſſant ſtroke with the counterbuſte of his ſtaffe, as it was too late for him to call for a Chyrurgian. When the other two brethren ſaw this ſpectacle, and being perſwaded that their elder Brother was wounded to the death, provoked with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame rage and indignation, they came to <hi>Belcar</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th theſe words.</p>
               <p>In an evil hour (Knight) didſt thou give that blow, becauſe thy death ſhall recompence the fame. So they ran both together fiercely agaiſt him, the one failing in the meeting, and the others hap ſo good, as he gave <hi>Belcar</hi> a ſmall wound on the Arm; yet being of reſolute courage, he buckled with them ſo cloſe, as one of them he ſent to kéep company with his eldeſt brother, and the other he brought into ſuch extremity, that he fell from his horſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52643:8"/>
of his ſenſes. The Squire that came with theſe thrée brethren, ſéeing the bad fortune of his Maſters ſons, rode preſently back to the Caſtle, and finding the aged Knight in his chamber thus began.</p>
               <p>Alas my Lord, in an unhappy hour did you entertain the Knight that lodged here laſt night, who (as it ſéems) came onely to kill your ſons. So delivered he the whole diſcourſe of the fight, which provoked the ſad father to ſhed forth abundance of tears: yet did he eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his ſons, whoſe pride and arrogancy had thus cauſed their own death. His ſervants underſtanding the cauſe of his laments, went preſently to the place where the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were diſcomfited, and there they found two of them deprived of life, the third likewiſe in very great danger, unleſſe ſpéedy proviſion were made to prevent it. So cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to be laid in a Litter, and the other two on a Knightly B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er, they thus brought them to their fathers Caſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where their Lady mother met them with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effuſe of tears and lamentations, as one would have judged her altogether void of ſence and diſcretion, then any way pertaker of humane wit or reaſon. Like ſorrow was made by one of her daughters, who loved her brethren very dearly, and after ſhe had ſomewhat pacified her ſelf, ſhe made a ſolemn vow to her mother, never to take reſt in her mind and thoughts, untill ſhe were throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on the murtherer. Wherefore when her two dead brethren were buried, ſhe departed againſt her fathers will, accompanied onely with two Squires to ſéek <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> intending to be revenged on him by one means or other.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. How <hi>Belcar</hi> came unknown into <hi>Macedon,</hi> where he bare away the prize of the Tourny which King <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos</hi> had appointed, to honour the marriage of the Princeſs <hi>Deniſa</hi>: and how he diſcovered himſelf to <hi>Alderina,</hi> daughter to the Duke of Pontus and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Elcar</hi> riding in great haſte toward <hi>Carderia,</hi> finding the heat of the day very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, he alighted at a fair Fountain to refreſh himſelf a while, where long he had not ſtayed, but in a path leading di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the ſame place, he beheld a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Knights and Ladies coming, attended on with a very ſufficient train. It was the Duke of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi> who rode to <hi>Macedon</hi> to the marriage which the king <hi>Florendos</hi> had made, betwéen his daughter <hi>Deniſa</hi> and the King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> Nephew to the wife of <hi>Caniano.</hi> This Duke had his eſpouſed Lady <hi>Laurana</hi> with him, as alſo one of his fair daughters named <hi>Alderina,</hi> who rode formoſt in the troop, beguiling the time in talk with her Ladies: yet intending to ſtay till the heat was paſt, and in the mean while to ſolace her ſelf at the Fountain. There ſhe arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before <hi>Belcar</hi> had put on his Helmet, ſo that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his amiable countenance, his rich armour, and yet having no company but one Squire: as a Lady wiſe and wall governed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe ſaluted him very graciouſly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Belcar</hi> was ſomewhat amazed, doubting ſhe knew of whence and what he was. But ſoon did he alter that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and rather thinking this kindneſſe to proceed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonair curteſie, imagined her of high calling, for which cauſe he made her humble reverence, and ſéeing how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52643:9"/>
followed his Lady, among whom he might peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be known, he called for his horſe minding to ride a contrary way. <hi>Alderina</hi> hereat ſomewhat moved, becauſe ſhe deſired to know of whence he was, thus ſpake, Sir Knight, abide here hardly at your eaſe, and for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming do not forſake a place ſo ſweet and delectable: you ſee the heat of the day is ſuch, as ſcantly will permit you to travell. If you go to adventure your fortune in the Tourney at <hi>Macedon,</hi> you may ride with the Duke my Father, who will be very glad of your company, and much more my ſelf, becauſe my good hap was firſt to find you here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Belcar</hi> humbly thanking her for this courteſie made an excuſe that he could not go to <hi>Macedon,</hi> becauſe he had ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent affairs elſewhere, and whither he muſt travell with all ſpeed: wherefore taking his leave again of her, he rode which way liked him beſt, onely to eſcape unknown of this company. And meeting a Squire, that came after the train with the carriage, he demanded if he knew the Lord that rode by ſo wel accompanied; to whom the ſquire anſwered that it was the Duke of <hi>Pontus,</hi> who rode to <hi>Macedon</hi> to the feaſt of the King <hi>Florendos</hi> for the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his daughter <hi>Deniſe,</hi> and that the Duke had his fair daughter <hi>Alderina</hi> with him, to ſee the Iouſts and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament which was now prepared. So ſoone as <hi>Belcar</hi> heard theſe words, he preſently conjectured, that the Lady which came firſt to the Fountain was the Dukes daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of whom report had made great commendation. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he determined to go ſee this aſſembly, in the moſt ſecret manner as he could deviſe: for he had time enough to accompliſh his voyage. So forſook he the way to the Iſle of <hi>Carderia,</hi> framing his journy toward <hi>Macedon,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming near the City, he overtook two Knights that rode to the Triumph: they having reciprocally ſaluted each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the two Knights demanded of <hi>Belcar</hi> if he came to Iouſt? I come to ſee (quoth he) what men at Arms will
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52643:10"/>
enter the field at this time of brave exerciſe. Then let us ride together if you pleaſe, (ſaid they) for we left our countries for the ſelf ſame cauſe. Thus rode they on friendly together, and arriving at <hi>Macedon,</hi> they found the field all covered with Tents, which belonged to the noble perſonages that were come to the feaſt. For this cauſe the two Knights gave in charge to their Squires, to provide their Pavillion, which was purpoſely brought with them, intreating <hi>Belcar</hi> likewiſe to kéep them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: whereto (becauſe he would not enter the City) he gladly conſented, thinking he ſhould hardly find a more convenient lodging.</p>
               <p>On the morrow there arrived the Duke of <hi>Pontus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom rode the King <hi>Florendos,</hi> as one willing to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his new kindred: but <hi>Alderina</hi> ſhewed ſuch Majeſty in countenance, as every eye wondred at her rare perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, notwithſtanding ſhe was ſomewhat ſad and penſive, the cauſe procéeding from her deſire, to know the Knight ſhe ſaw at the fountain, whom yet ſhe could not by any means forget. When <hi>Belcar</hi> beheld her arm in arm with the King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and in what coſtly garments ſhe was attired: he imagined her more fair, then when he ſaw her at the fountain, ſo that he reſolutely intended, if he could not finiſh the adventure of <hi>Francelina,</hi> to give himſelf to travell, and to enterpriſe ſuch attempts as might be thought worthy the love of this Lady. All this while the Quéen <hi>Griana,</hi> wife to the King <hi>Florendos,</hi> very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entertained the Dutcheſs <hi>Laurana,</hi> and the young prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Deniſa</hi> accompanying <hi>Alderina,</hi> would not forſake her till the marriage night.</p>
               <p>On the morrow following, the King, the Queen, and the new married couple, came into the field to behold the Tourney, where they were no ſooner mounted on the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds, which were ſumptuouſly adorned as beſeemed ſo great perſonages: but both on the one ſide and the other, they might behold great ſtore of armed Knights, cheefly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52643:10"/>
they that came from the Court of the Emperour, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not be preſent at his ſiſters marriage, ſent many of his bold Barons to honour the aſſembly. The brave exploits in feats of arms there performed, ſurpaſſed them of greateſt reputation, and among other, the Dukes of <hi>Anemon</hi> and <hi>Menſa</hi> ſo well behaved themſelves as they had well near gained the honour of the firſt aſſault, if <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> had not ſuddenly arrived, who ſtayed a while to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the order of the Iouſts, intending to help the weaker part, when at length he ſaid to his companions: follow me my friends to aſſiſt the vanquiſhed. So giving his horſe the ſpurs, he ran fiercely with his ſword drawn, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Bellequin</hi> the ſon of <hi>Moſſo,</hi> who did the greateſt harm to the other ſide: and with him he met ſo bravely in his carreer, as horſe and man went both to the ground. Afterward, he dealt ſo roughly with all them that durſt meet him in the face, as in ſhort time courage began to revive in thoſe Knights, who (in the judgement of all the beholders) were before eſtéemed vanquiſhed.</p>
               <p>Which the Duke of <hi>Anemon</hi> perceiving, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to grow into ſuch diſgrace, he was thereat excéeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended, and thruſting himſelf among the thickeſt, gave <hi>Belcar</hi> a very great ſtroke with his ſword on the Helmet: for which he received ſpéedy repayment, for <hi>Belcar,</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf in his ſtirrops, returned the Duke ſuch a cruel blow through the ſight of his helmet, as he fell to the ground aſtonied betwéen his horſe legs. Then breaking in amidſt the praaſe, he gave ſuch ſharp entertainment to all that met him, as the King <hi>Florendos,</hi> and the other great eſtates that accompanied him, were driven thereby into great admiration: nor was he known to any there but the Princeſſe <hi>Alderina,</hi> who being ſeated on the right hand of the Quéen <hi>Deniſa,</hi> could not ſmother her thoughts, but thus ſpak. What think you (Madam) of the Knight in Gréen Armour? What do I think? anſwered the Quéen, truly never did I ſée the man who might eual
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52643:11"/>
or paragon himſelf with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that he alone hath done more in this tourny then all the other: and greatly would it content me to know if he be deſcended of noble bloud as he delivers good teſtimony of his knowledge in feats of Arms.</p>
               <p>Madam, (quoth <hi>Alderina</hi>) I cannot think him leſſe then you doubt of, in reſpect he concealeth himſelf ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and would not willingly be known of any. Herewith ſhe recounted how ſhe found him at the Fountain, bare headed without his helmet: and this I can aſſure you (qd. ſhe) that as you confeſſe him valiant Arms, ſo can I wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe him of ſuch brave feature and complexion as there is no one abſolute point wanting in him. Your ſpeeches ſaid the Queen, makes me much more deſirous to know him, wherefore I will ſend one to him for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Then I beſeech your Majeſty, anſwered <hi>Alderina,</hi> to ſend one of my Pages, who ſhall attend for him till the end of tho Tourney, and then conjure him in your name, that he ſend you word of whence and what he is: and if he ſtand loth to be known, to reſolve him from your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and me, that no living creature ſhall bewray him by our means. Your counſell I very well allow, ſaid the new married Queen, but I would that this Embaſſage ſhould rather go from you, becauſe he remembring what knowledge you had of him at the Fountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will happily manifeſt himſelf unto you rather then any other. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Alderina</hi> called one of her pages named <hi>Gracian,</hi> artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially inſtructing him in his errand to the green Knight: that uſing inſtant intreaty, accompanied with a ſingular deſire, he ſhould gain the mean to return with his name and parentage.</p>
               <p>All this while <hi>Belcar</hi> ſhewed ſuch rare deeds of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, as having well laboured the adverſary, and none leſt that would confront him: he went as Conquerour forth of the Liſts, where he met the two Knights that came with him thither, who ſtayed more deſirous to note
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52643:11"/>
his behaviour in the fight then to intrude themſelves in place of ſuch danger, and being not a little glad of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor he had done them, in that their companion bare away the palm of victory, they rode on each ſide of him towards their Tent, being followed all the way by the Princeſſe Page, who awaiting due time to deliver his meſſage, took <hi>Belcars</hi> horſe by the bridle, and uſing ſuch means of ſecret conference, as <hi>Belcar</hi> ſtooped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to hear him, he ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus whiſpered with him. Sir Knight I would it might like you to ride aſide a little, that I might deliver a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſecreſie to you. He who was ſo courteous and affable as any man could be, preſently left his two companions, when <hi>Gracian</hi> thus began his meſſage.</p>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>Alderina</hi> daughter to the Duke of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Durace,</hi> hath at this time ſent me to you, to let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that ſhe hath received juſt cauſe of offence towards you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that ſhe comming to ſee this Tourney, you disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make offer of your company: Notwithſtanding if you will grant one requeſt that ſhe makes by me, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all paſſed ungentlneſs, ſhe will gladly leave further to misdeem of you. My friend, anſwered <hi>Belcar,</hi> the thing muſt be very difficult or impoſſible, that I would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize to obtain the gracious pardon of ſo choiſe a Lady as is thy Miſtreſs: it may be that I have treſpaſſed in duty towards her excellency, but in ſooth meer ignorance of her eſtate was the onely cauſe. And when I left her at the Fountain, far was my intent from coming to this Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in ſo much as I was thereto (in a manner) conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, notwithſtanding excuſes of as great importance as thoſe I uſed to thy gentle Lady.</p>
               <p>It reſteth now, (quoth the Page) that you grant my Miſtreſſe her earneſt deſire, which is, to know what you are, and why you conceal your ſelf in ſuch ſort: For beholding your noble and valiant behaviour, ſhe ſets you beyond all other in her conceit, and promiſeth withal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the word of ſo great a perſon as ſhe is, not to reveal
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52643:12"/>
it to any, if you be willing it ſhould be ſo. Highly may I commend my fortune (ſaid <hi>Belcar</hi>) that a Princeſſe ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and perfect, would deign to enquire after my poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts: and though I had vowed to conceal my ſelf from the whole world, yet would I ſtrain courteſie with that vow for her ſake. Say to her therefore, courteous Page, that my name is <hi>Belcar,</hi> Nephew to the Emperour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>; and the cauſe why I would not willingly be known to any, is the ſmall portion of time ſince I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my Knighthood: And having not yet done any thing worthy my name, or to be accounted among the actions of honour, I determined not to publiſh the ſame, til I might do it with good teſtimony. Thou mayeſt alſo aſſure her from me, that he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceforth I ſhal ſerve as her devoted knight, hoping under favour of her name to gain ſuch account, as both I and mine ſhal remain perpetually bound to her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. And when I have accompliſhed any thing, that may he reputed worthy honourable commendation, I will come my ſelf, and offer therewithal to her my heart, which hath received ſuch an impreſſion of obeyſance to her, as henceforth it will attempt nothing, but in her ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: proof may ſhe make hereof in commanding me; for ſuch is my deſire to be imployed in her ſervice, as were I aſſured my death conſiſted in the attempt, yet could not any fear thereof with-hold me. Let me further intreat her, not to diſcloſe my name to any one, becauſe at this time I will not viſit the King <hi>Florendos,</hi> and the Quéen, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I am ſo near allied unto them. With this anſwer returned <hi>Gracian</hi> to his Lady, who attended his comming in great devotion, ſo that he was no ſooner entred the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but ſhe demanded the ſucceſſe of his meſſage. All well Madam, anſwered the Page, but you muſt kéep it very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, becauſe the Knight himſelf hath ſo deſired. Which after ſhe had faithfully promiſed to do, he told her, that the Knight was <hi>Belcar</hi> ſon to the King of <hi>Hungaria.</hi> May it be ſo, quoth the Quéen <hi>Deniſa</hi>? then is he my Nephew; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52643:12"/>
thinks he ſcorn to be known to us? Right gladly would I have ſéen him, for from our infancie we were nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together: And well may you aſſure your ſelf, Madam <hi>Alderina,</hi> that he hath béen evermore benign and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which makes me not rejoyce a little, that his fortune in Arms is equal with his other vertue; yet ſeeing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to paſſe unknown, let us keep the ſame ſo ſecret as we may. It were needleſſe to demand if <hi>Alderina</hi> were pleaſed, when ſhe heard that <hi>Belcar</hi> was iſſued of ſo great and illuſtrious bloud, offering himſelf withal ſo religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly her Knight: wherefore now ſhe began extreamly to affect him and imprinted the remembrance of him ſo live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in her ſpirit, as nothing might deface it again. Thus hourly ranged Loves paſſions in her heart, wherein they took immediate ambuſh, ſo ſoon as ſhe beheld him at the Fountain.</p>

               <head>CHAP III. How <hi>Belcar</hi> fearing to be known, departed ſecretly from Macedon, and by the way met with a Knight, whom he vanquiſhed: And how he fought a cruel Combat with him that defended the Bridge where the fair <hi>Francelina</hi> was enchanted.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O ſoon as <hi>Belcar</hi> had ended with <hi>Alderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Squire, he minded to depart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, fearing leſt the King <hi>Florendos</hi> would ſend for him, as indeed he did ſoon after: for he greatly deſired to know the Knight that bare away the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Tourney. But his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was greatly deceived, in that <hi>Belcar</hi> was already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; whereof the King could not be perſwaded, but that he miſſed his preſence in the Triumph following, which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52643:13"/>
he compared to the paſtime of little children, in reſpect of the former day, when the unknown Knight performed matter of incredible valour. And albeit the Quéen <hi>Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> and the Princeſſe <hi>Alderiná</hi> heard every judgement paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the Knight, yet would they yeeld no other anſwer, but that he ſéemed to be one of the beſt eſtéemed Knights in the Emperors Court. <hi>Belcar</hi> then having graciouſly thanked his two companions for the courteſie and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they had uſed towards him, took his friendly farewel of them, feigning an earneſt conſtraint, which command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his preſence in matters of importance. The Knights loth to looſe ſo good a friend made offer to go with him in his travel; but he excuſed their requeſt with a neceſſary venial wherewith they were pleaſed, and he had liberty to depart.</p>
               <p>And riding along the way where he met <hi>Alderina,</hi> he happened into a fair gréen meddow where (becauſe no lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging was near at hand) he determined to make his hoſtage that night: But as he thought to enter into a ſound ſléep, a ſudden imagination caught hold on his ſences, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the rare beauty of <hi>Alderina,</hi> during which paſſion, he was conſtrained thus to parley with himſelf. In ſooth, <hi>Belcar,</hi> right well mayeſt thou be charged with diſcourteſie and ingratitude, having made ſo ſlender ſhew of civility to ſo fair a Princeſſe as the Dukes daughter of <hi>Pontus</hi>; full well may it beſéem thée to amend this fault, and by the dutifull repentance fitting a Knight, recover the note of thy former blemiſh. After many amorous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, he concluded (if he could finiſh the adventure of <hi>Francelina</hi>) to make choiſe of this Lady onely as his wife; and in theſe imaginations a ſwéet ſlumber overtook him, wherein he continued till the next morning, when mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on horſeback, and riding not paſt the ſpace of two miles, he met with a Knight at Arms, who demanded if he came from <hi>Macedon,</hi> and if ſhe Nuptials of the Kings daughter were finiſhed: <hi>Belcar</hi> anſwered, that they were

now in performing, and if it liked him to travel thither, he ſhould there find matter enough to be imployed in. The Knight left <hi>Belcar</hi> to his journey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpéeches they departed.</p>
               <p>But if you be deſirous to know the man, it was <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> who departed from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with <hi>Colmelio,</hi> in ſearch of the Damoſel that brought ſuch a ſudden meſſage to the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> as you may read in the laſt Chapter of his Hiſtory. And albeit they had travelled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Countreys to find her, yet could they not hear any ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of her, becauſe ſhe preſently returned to the Caſtle of <hi>Carderia</hi> from whence the Fairies ſent her to the Court on that occaſion, the intent thereof being no other, but onely to extol and commend the future proweſſe of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendos,</hi> Son to the Quéen of <hi>Tharſus</hi> and the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and that the Knight who ſhould come to finiſh the inchantment of <hi>Francelina,</hi> might be received with greater honour and magnificence. <hi>Cardino</hi> had tried his fortune in this adventure, but he could ſpéed no better then others had done before him, wherefore hearing of the feaſt and open Court held at <hi>Macedon,</hi> he went as one doubtfull to come ſhort to the Triumphs, till <hi>Belcar</hi> had thereof certainly reſolved him. Theſe Knights were not parted the ſpace of a mile, but <hi>Cardino</hi> met the Damoſel, who was ſiſter to the two brethren ſlain by <hi>Belcar</hi> in the wood, ſhe having followed him to the Court of the King <hi>Florendos,</hi> was advertiſed by a ſquire of his ſucceſſe in the tourny, and how he rode the common high way leading to <hi>Carderia,</hi> whereupon ſhe made good haſt after him, and met with <hi>Cardino</hi> ſoon after their departure, to whom ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in this manner.</p>
               <p>I beſéeeh ye Gentleman to reſolve me certainly, if ye met a Knight in gréen Armour or no the moſt traiterous and diſloyal man that this day liveth: for my father having done him all the honour he could deviſe, while one night he came and lodged at his Caſtle, and on the morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52643:14"/>
(the more to content him) commanded my three bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to accompany him ſomewhat on the way; but he, a moſt inhumane and unthankfull wretch, without any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſlew two of them, and put the third in great danger of his life. And in this juſt cauſe I purſue the villain, in hope to meet with ſome worthy man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who deteſting ſuch notorious and horrible ingratitude, will (in taking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on my grief) revenge this injury. So well could the traytreſſe colour her ſpeeches, and ſet ſo fair a gloſſe on her cautelous preſopopey, as ſhe imprinted in the heart of <hi>Cardino</hi> a dutiful regard to revenge ſuch wrong; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thus anſwered.</p>
               <p>Damoſel, if it be ſo as you ſay, the Knight cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf, but that he is both a Traytor and a Fellon, nor will the God of Heaven ſuffer him to eſcape unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in this world. The Damoſel with terrible oaths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted what ſhe had ſaid deſiring him to give her aid, if no other occaſions might hinder her ſuit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Right gladly (quoth <hi>Cardino</hi>) will I perform my duty herein; for that I am a profeſſed enemy to ſuch offenders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhall cauſe him to pay dearly for his treachery. So rode he with the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel after <hi>Belcar,</hi> but all that day they could not overtake him. On the morrow they got ſight of him on the edge of a Mountain, whereat the Damoſel not a little conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, deſired <hi>Cardino</hi> now to rouze his forces againſt the Tyrant that had ſo diſhonoured her. <hi>Cardino</hi> promiſing to accompliſh her deſire, gave the ſpurs to his horſe, and gallopped after <hi>Belcar,</hi> and in a great Bravado thus cried to him. Stay Traytor, unworthy the name of a Knight, and receive thy guerdon at my hand, for ſlaughtering him that entertained thee with all humanity. <hi>Belcar</hi> hearing himſelf thus injured, was immediately provoked into cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and turning towards him that touched him with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty, he thus ſternly anſwered.</p>
               <p>But little to thy profit will it be, to purſue me with ſuch falſe and lying accuſations. So claſping his helmet, he ran
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52643:14"/>
furiouſly againſt <hi>Cardino</hi> who met him with no leſſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and vivacity, and breaking his lance bravely, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſcarred the skin of his enemy: but <hi>Belcar</hi> welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him with ſo ſound a ſalutation, as he fell down with the ſaddle betwéen his legs, ſo ſore aſtonied with his fall as he was not able to ſtir hand nor foot, which <hi>Belcar</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, rode on and there left him. The Damoſel ſéeing <hi>Cardino</hi> in ſuch wofull plight, alighted from her palfray, and with the help of his Squire binding up his wounds, determined to bring him to ſome place for help uſing the greateſt ſhews of lamentation that could be. Ah heaven (quoth ſhe) why give ye ſtrength to wicked men againſt the good and vertuous? ſuffer not this diſloyal villain to do any further danger, but rather give ſome miſerable end to his unworthy life. By this time the Squire had mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cardino</hi> on his horſe, and ſo they returned the ſame way they came, happening to the place where <hi>Belcar</hi> had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his faſt the morning before.</p>
               <p>There they underſtood by their Hoſt, that he was gone to prove the adventure of <hi>Francelina,</hi> whither the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel would gladly have followed him; yet was ſhe loth to leave <hi>Cardino</hi> in ſuch danger, and therefore abode there with him three days, uſing all the means ſhe could to heal him, becauſe that for her ſake he was ſo wounded: where we will leave them, and return to the onely thread of our Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>So long rode <hi>Belcar,</hi> that he arrived within half a days journey of the Caſtle where <hi>Francelina</hi> was: This For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe appertained to a Lady that was a Widdow, who had two fair daughters, and a ſon already knighted, of no leſſe valour in feats of Arms, then learned and well ſeen in divers other Diſciplines. In this place was he marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous well entertained, the Lady of the Caſtle being a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great honour, and her daughters of very Courtly and civil behaviour. After ſupper, <hi>Belcar</hi> entred into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with them, and among many other things, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52643:15"/>
the cauſe that moved ſo many Knights to attempt the adventure of that Iſle; when the Ladies ſon, who was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Lypes,</hi> anſwered him in this ſort. Beleeve me ſir, I have ever accounted the man but badly counſelled, that takes ſuch pains to travel hither, ſeeing it is ſo long time ſince any Knight arrived here, who returned not without diſhonour, becauſe the action and exploit of this enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſo wonderfully compacted by the three Faries) is of ſuch efficacy, as it behoves him that ſhall finiſh the ſame, to be of moſt rare and exquiſite perfection.</p>
               <p>But tell me then (quoth <hi>Belcar</hi>) the ſtate of this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and wherein conſiſteth the greateſt peril thereof; for as yet have I not met with any one that could tell me the truth, to ſatisfie my long and earneſt deſire. Better then any other (anſwered <hi>Lypes</hi>) can I diſcourſe the ſame unto you, becauſe I have often accompanied Knights travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thither as you now do, and ſeen many Combat with him that defends the entrance on the bridge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> albeit to their great diſadvantage. Know then (gentle ſir) that the Iſle of <hi>Carderia</hi> ſtretcheth in diameter very far, beeing on the one ſide encloſed with the ſea, and on the other are moſt wholeſome Bathes and rivers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which hinder the ſalt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from comming near the Caſtle: At the foot where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is builded a marvellous artificial bridge, heretofore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſable for all Knights errant, but ſince the time that <hi>Francelina</hi> was encloſed within the great Dungeon, there might not enter any ſtranger; thoſe of the Iſle onely come and go, but others not. Vpon this bridge are erected thrée Turrets, one of them being in the middeſt, and the other two at either end. In the firſt is a Knight, ſurpaſſing the common ſtature and proportion of men, ſo fierce, hardy and couragiouſly, as ſince the time of this enchantment, he hath not béen dealt withal by any one, that could in ought diſable his proweſſe, onely the Lord of the Iſle of <hi>Lique</hi> excepted, ſon to him whom the Emperour <hi>Palmerin</hi> vanuiſhed, when in the Tourney he conquered the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittary.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52643:15"/>
He, being named <hi>Lynedes,</hi> was ſo reſolute and magnanimous, as he fought againſt the Knight of the bridge from morning till night; and though the Combat was fierce and cruel, yet could no want of courage be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in him; which fell not out ſo with the guardant of the bridge, becauſe the loſſe of his bloud ſo weakened him, as his heart began utterly to diſmay. But an ill favoured Dwarf, who never ſtirs from the Beacon of the firſt Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, to diſcover ſuch Knights as come along the field, by winding an enchanted Horn that hung about his neck, therewith ſo revived the Knights ſtrength again, as if he had but even then entred the combat.</p>
               <p>In this ſort the fight continued till Sun ſetting, when <hi>Lynedes</hi> perceiving his enemy to wax féeble again, and that the Dwarf as yet blew not his Horn, brought the Knight of the bridge into ſuch extremity that he fell upon his hands to the ground. Then running ſwiftly over the bridge, he came to the Turret in the middeſt thereof, the gates whereof being open before, clapt together at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival with ſuch a fearfull trembling of the whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Lynedes</hi> fell to the earth in a ſwoon.</p>
               <p>In this trance he remained a great while, ſo that his Squires fearing he was dead indéed, bemoned their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with very grievous lamentations: But when hée came to his former féeling, they ſaw hée was ſo cruelly wounded as they carried him to his tent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where thrée days he remained to re-obtain his health; and on the fourth, fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf able to ſit on Horſeback, and not willing to make any further proof of this adventure, he departed thence ſorrowing for his bad fortune. And this I tell you ſir for a certainty, that when the Dwarf ſits as Centinel in the lanthorn of the firſt Tower, perceiving the Knight of the bridge to have the worſt of the combat, hée with the ſound of his Horn renues his ſtrength, which is the cauſe that no man is able to deal with him. Seeing then this enterpriſe bringeth ſuch danger, and oftentimes death
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52643:16"/>
withal, I could wiſh that hereafter no man would attempt his own ruine.</p>
               <p>You tell me matter of marvel, anſwered <hi>Belcar,</hi> and right skilfull were the Fairies in framing this enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo it ſhould ſéem, that they have <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> encloſed the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy there without great occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being aſſured that ſome Knight ſhall end the adventure, to which each one travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with this couragious hope, that he is the man for whom it is reſerved. Nor can I be diſſwaded from it, if many heretofore have fallen in that errour, therefore no doubt of what ſhall happen can hinder my determination. If I happen in my tryal to be overcome, I ſhall but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of them, that could not attain y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> height of their enterprize, and no other diſhonour can I receive. <hi>Lypes</hi> earneſtly intreated him to forbear the voyage, and ſo did his ſiſters likewiſe, into whoſe grace he was greatly entred, eſpecially the youngeſt, fair and debonair beyond the other: but all their perſwaſive reaſons could not cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge him; for <hi>Belcar</hi> having travelled ſo far for that purpoſe, might not by any occaſion whatſoever be withdrawn from making proof of his fortune. When <hi>Lypes</hi> ſaw him ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately inclined, he made offer to bear him company, if it were but onely to ſhew him the way which friendly courteſie <hi>Belcar</hi> accepted; ſo on the morrow they mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on horſeback, and came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſle about mid-day. There was ſet up a rich Tent for this young Prince, which the ſiſters of <hi>Lypes</hi> had ſent thither by thrée Squires, with all neceſſary proviſion for his attempt; and in the evening <hi>Belcar</hi> went to view the Iſle, regarding the Tower wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Francelina</hi> was impriſoned; invocating on God in his ſpirit, to endue him with ſuch ability, as he might deliver her, and bear away the honour of the adventure. Theſe imaginations ſo buſied his thoughts, as all that night he could entertain no other, but oftentimes thus talked with himſelf. Ah <hi>Belcar,</hi> why ſhouldeſt thou thus delay time, and not rather couragiouſly attempt the execution of this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52643:16"/>
enterpriſe? Admit thou want force anſwerable to a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch dignity, yet ſhould the renown and generoſity of thine Anceſtors ſtimulate thée hereto, being ſon to one of the beſt Knights that liveth this day under the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, and nephew to the great Emperour, with whom none may be equalled. In theſe, and ſuch like conceits he conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the night, and in the morning (having armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) came to the Bridge, where in a convenient place near the firſt Tower, he eſpied the Knight that defended the paſſage, whoſe huge ſtature ſomewhat amazed <hi>Belcar</hi>; and as he offered to ſtep on the Bridge, the Knight very proudly thus ſpake.</p>
               <p>Withdraw thy ſelf Knight, unleſſe thou wilt enter fight with me, for I am here to deny paſſage to any. For no other cauſe come I, anſwered <hi>Belcar,</hi> but to try thy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and paſſe the Bridge if poſſibly I may. With theſe words he gave the Knight ſuch a ſound ſtroke on the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, that he thought the fire flaſhed out of his eye, and ſo they began a long and dangerous combat, the Knight gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Belcar</hi> many cruel blows with his Iron mace, and he defending them ſo well as he could, till having ſomewhat wearied his enemy, and thinking to do as he heard of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes,</hi> but the Knight gave him ſuch a forcible ſtroke on the ſhoulder, as he was conſtrained to ſet one knée to the ground to eſcape the fall. Herewith the Dwarf blew his Horn, which rejoyced them within the Caſtle: albeit the Prince was aſtonied-hereat, yet he diſſembled the ſame from being eſpied.</p>
               <p>The Knight having recovered his former ſtrength, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed <hi>Belcar</hi> with marvellous fury, who notwithſtanding held out couragiouſly, and one thing comforted him above all other, which was, that none of his adverſaries blows gave him any bléeding wound, but bruiſed his fleſh a little under his Armor, whereby he fought at his own pleaſure. Thrée times the Dwarf blew to animate his Champion, by which means <hi>Belcar</hi> was much overlaboured, becauſe he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52643:17"/>
could find no opportunity to reſt himſelf: but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if he ſhewed leſſe valour then he had done, in vain he might account his travelling thither, and greatly would it redound to his ſhame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the Emperour ſhould be adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed thereof. In the end, he had brought his enemy into ſuch a ſtate, as he got on the bridge without any more reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and came to the Tower that ſtood in the middeſt thereof; but the gates cloſed together ſo furiouſly, that he was ſmitten to the earth deprived of his ſences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lypes</hi> being glad that he had recovered the bridge, came to him, and with the help of the Squires carried him into the Tent, where ſuddenly unarming him, they applyed ſuch remedies as brought him to his former ſences. He had no ſooner féeling of himſelf, but he entred into many ruful lamentations, as well for his misfortune and diſgrace, as alſo with the pain he felt of his adverſaries ſtrokes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his Armour being battered to pieces was a ſufficient witneſſe. Comfort your ſelf, my Lord (quoth <hi>Lypes</hi>) and let your wonted courage exile this anguiſh, remembring that theſe eight years no Knight came to the Iſle, onely <hi>Lynedes</hi> excepted, that won like honour as you have done at this inſtant: Greater reaſon have you then to cheriſh your fortune, then thus to condemn it with exclamations. Ah my friend (anſwered <hi>Belcar</hi>) little pleaſure take I in this ſucceſſe, for that my intent procéeded further; but ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no remedy, I muſt with patience bear my ſhame; for of matters ſo diveliſhly enchanted, can ſeldom ariſe greater good: But curſed be the Fairies and their helliſh charms, that deal ſo diſcourteouſly with poor travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Knights.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IIII. How Belcar concluded to combat with all ſuch as came to prove the adventure of <hi>Francelina:</hi> and how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other he fought with the Marqueſse of <hi>Troſſe,</hi> whom he vanquiſhed, and afterward with <hi>Tirendos</hi> to whom he made himſelf known.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Elcar</hi> being indifferently calmed by the courteous behaviour of <hi>Lipes,</hi> determined to recover his paſſed foil by actions of Chivalry, and therefore reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in that place, to combat with all ſuch as came to try the adventure: but to his intent he added this principally, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what déeds of Arms he there performed, or in any other place where he might be imploied all ſhould be for the love of <hi>Alderina,</hi> daughter to the Duke of <hi>Pontus,</hi> whom above all other he meant moſt conſtantly to love. And if his fortune were to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by any Knight, he would then forthwith return to the Court of the King <hi>Florendos.</hi> This deſign he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Lypes,</hi> who was not a little glad thereof, ſaying, that he ſhould apprehend great matters by his enterpriſe, becauſe continually many good Knights reſorted thither. And becauſe (quoth he) you are ſo reſolutely minded, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall make me to forſake your company, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the knightly Chivalry, which I am out of doubt to ſée executed by you. I offer my ſelf to accompany you in all loyal ſervice. Now the better to furniſh their wants, he ſent to his mothers houſe for all kind of proviſion, that might agrée with the time of their abode there. By this time <hi>Belcar</hi> found himſelf able to vear arms and therefore went to take his place of charge, at what time the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Troſſe</hi> came to hazard his fortune. This Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52643:18"/>
was a brave and hardy man at Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and although he came from his country wel accompanied with Knights Squires, and Pages: yet cauſed he them to ſtay a pretty diſtance from that place, and came thither but with one Squire that carried his Lance. When <hi>Belcar</hi> ſaw him make ſo couragiouſly toward the bridge, he mounted on horſeback and coming to him, thus ſpake.</p>
               <p>Gentleman, you may not paſſe here, except you firſt try the Iouſt with me, becauſe I have eſtabliſhed here ſuch a Law, as that no Knight ſhall have battell with him that kéeps the Bridge, untill he have firſt diſmounted me: for having received ſome foil in this place not many days ſince, I will not ſuffer any one to prevail in this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unleſſe he bring me firſt into ſubjection. Great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is this in you (anſwered the Marqueſſe) that you will take in hand to bear a burthen of ſuch weight: but I think you do it to this end, that you would depart hence with greater ſhame and confuſion, then ever you ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained heretofore. That quarrel (quoth <hi>Belcar</hi>) ſhall our ſwords ſoon decide. And ſo without any more ſpeeches they fell to the combat, wherein the Marqueſſe ſhewed very Knightly and gallant behaviour, albeit <hi>Belcar</hi> caſt him from his Saddle, and afterward fought with him on foot a long while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the end the Marqueſſe was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, and underſtanding the name of his Conquerour, returned to the place where he left his company, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had recovered better health, he rode ſtraight to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> where he recounted his overthrow by <hi>Belcar.</hi> Of this news the King <hi>Florendos</hi> and the Queen were very joyful ſaying they had a Nephew that was ſo named, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſired to know what Arms he wore? when the Marqueſs told them he was in gréen armour. Without queſtion (quoth the King) it was the ſame Knight that won the honour of the Tourney, and went hence ſecretly leaſt he ſhould be known, wherewith I cannot be juſtly offended, becauſe both in this enterpriſe and knightly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52643:18"/>
valour, he reſembleth his worthy father King <hi>Fryſol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Each one in Court was well pleaſed with theſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, but above all other the Princeſſe <hi>Alderina,</hi> becauſe ſhe had bequeathed his remembrance to the ſecret cloſet of her heart, and as the daies, ſo her lovely affections to him increaſed, in reſpect of the great praiſes was every where bruited of him, which made many worthy Knights to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture their fortune with him with whoſe conqueſt he ſtill gave grace to his own report. But let us now return to the damoſel that followed <hi>Belcar,</hi> to be revenged for her brethrens death ſhe ſéeing <hi>Cardino</hi> was indifferently reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, took her leave of him, becauſe ſhe intended to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute her enemy. It ſo fell out, that <hi>Tirendos</hi> ſon to the Duke <hi>Euſtace,</hi> who travelled to find his companion <hi>Belcar</hi> arrived at the ſame lodging where the damoſel was, and noting her complaints, which ſhe could deliver very artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, he took compaſſion on her, promiſing to aſſiſt her in what he could. Demanding the cauſe of her ſorrowfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, ſhe told him how ſhe had two brethren traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſlain, by a diſloyal Knight whom her father enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained into his caſtle, and ſhe purſuing the murtherer, met a courteous Knight that undertook to revenge her cauſe, yet his miſ-fortune was ſuch, as he was likewiſe danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wounded which made her griefs the more impatient. Theſe flattering griefs ſo beguiled <hi>Tirendos,</hi> as he again made her promiſe of his aid, inquiring of her where the wounded Knight was.</p>
               <p>My Lord (quoth ſhe) he is here in his chamber, meetly well recovered by my pains and diligence. No ſooner was <hi>Tirendos</hi> entred the chamber, but he immediately knew <hi>Cardino,</hi> for whoſe hurt he was a great deal more ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and therefore vowed to him and the damoſel, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he met the Knight to be revenged on him. After ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny courteous embracings &amp; kind ſpeeches, he told <hi>Cardino</hi> how <hi>Belcar</hi> and he were both Knighted in one day, by the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> from whence he very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52643:19"/>
and ſecretly departed: and ever ſince have I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſearch of him, yet in no place can I hear any tidings of him. What arms doth he bear? ſaid <hi>Cardino,</hi> White, as I take it, anſwered <hi>Tirendos,</hi> and ſuch as are both rich and coſtly. No ſuch Knight have I ſéen (qd. <hi>Cardino</hi>) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily he may be now at <hi>Macedon,</hi> at the magnificent nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the Princeſſe <hi>Deniſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thither would I go, ſaid <hi>Tirendos,</hi> had I not paſt my promiſe to this Damoſel; nor can my mind enjoy any quiet, until I have found the Knight that ſo wronged her and you. All this night they were very merry together, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the damoſel for <hi>Tirendos</hi> his promiſe, becauſe he ſéemed a man of ſufficient valour to accompliſh her deſire. On the morrow they took their leave of <hi>Cardino</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied toward the Iſle of <hi>Carderia,</hi> where they arrived as <hi>Belcar</hi> was managing his great horſe: and no ſooner had the damoſell eſpied him, but ſhe preſently knew him by his Armour, wherefore diſſembling pittiful looks, ſhe thus ſpake to <hi>Tirendos.</hi> Behold Sir the Traitour that did put my Brethren to death, I think the Heavens ſtayed him in this place, that vengeance might be taken on him for the ſhame he hath done me. <hi>Tirendos</hi> was not a little glad hereof, becauſe he ſhould now make the firſt tryal of his Chivalry. But <hi>Belcar</hi> (who knew him by his Armour, being the ſame wherein he received his order) was ſcant well pleaſed with his preſence, becauſe he doubted that he was ſent to find him: notwithſtanding, he would make a little proof of him in the Iouſt, and therefore he came to him with theſe words. You may paſſe no further this way Sir Knight, becauſe I ſtand here to make denial thereof. Little count ſhall I make, anſwered <hi>Tirendos,</hi> of ſuch as thou art, that traiterouſly murthereſt Gentlemen, who gave thée welcome beyond thy deſerts, which I will cauſe thée buy full dearly. That would I fain ſée, ſaid <hi>Belcar,</hi> if it be in thée to make me confeſſe that which I never thought, much leſſe committed. Thou lieſt as a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52643:19"/>
anſwered <hi>Tirendos,</hi> I will make good what I have ſaid, therefore get you to your tools. Herewith they gave the ſpurs to their Horſes, and met very valiantly together, ſo that with breaking their Lances, they gave each other a little wound, <hi>Belcar</hi> loſing his ſtirrops, and <hi>Tirendos</hi> caſt forth of his ſaddle to the ground: but recovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preſently, he came againſt his enemy with his ſword drawn, ſaying, Alight ſir you were beſt, or I ſhal ſlay your Horſe.</p>
               <p>That will I gladly do (quoth <hi>Belcar</hi>) but it ſhall be to embrace you, for I have no will to enter combat with you. Alas ſir, ſaid <hi>Tirendos,</hi> it is no time now to ſcoff, albeit I am from my horſe, I am not vanquiſhed. Great pleaſure took <hi>Belcar</hi> to reaſon with his ſingular good friend, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting from his Horſe, thus replied. I ſpeak for your good (ſir) if you can ſée it; but ſéeing reaſon will not rule you, I am content to deal with you a little. <hi>Tirendos</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what offended at his fall, began to ſtrike at <hi>Belcar</hi> very reughly: but he who was loth to wrong his friend, threw his Sword and Shield to the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with open arms came to embrace him, ſaying. My perfect friend <hi>Tirendos,</hi> I have heretofore had experience of thy valiant behaviour, wherefore forgive thy brother <hi>Belcar,</hi> for not acquainting thée with my departure from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> yet was I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that thou wouldeſt follow in ſearch of me.</p>
               <p>How now (quoth <hi>Tirendos?</hi>) are you then my Lord and loving friend <hi>Belcar</hi>? In ſooth the errour commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was onely ignorance of you: put off your Helmet that I may be reſolved; for your diſguiſed Armour made me miſtak you. So caſting down their Helmets, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced each other very courteouſly, when <hi>Tirendos</hi> thus ſpake to <hi>Belcar.</hi> Hardly can I be perſwaded, my Lord, that you would conſent to ſuch treaſon as this Damoſel hath enformed me withal. Declare I pray you (quoth <hi>Belcar</hi>) whence ariſeth this ſlander; for another Knight (who I think I have ſlain or ſore wounded) purſued me with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52643:20"/>
the like quarrel; doubtleſſe this Damoſel is ſome bad wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to accuſe me with any ſuch diſloyalty. She told me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid <hi>Tirendos,</hi> that you being honorably entertained at her fathers Caſtle, where one night you were very friendly lodged, on the morrow, her thrée brethren bare you compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny on the way, and two of them without any cauſe you did murther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaving the third in very great danger.</p>
               <p>Ah trayterous Damoſel, anſwered <hi>Belcar,</hi> what an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſlander hath ſhe raiſed on me? and herewith he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed the whole diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according as y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> have read it in the firſt chapter of this Book. She ſéeing the two Knights agrée thus friendly, with the tears in her eys, gave forth theſe ſpéeches. Miſerable and unfortunate that I am, what a ſubtil colluſion do I hear? This Knight is as falſe and diſloyal to me, in not revenging my ſhame, as the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer that hath ſo highly wronged me: But ſéeing I am thus circumvented, and he a perjured wretch by breach of his promiſe unleſſe I ſpeedily die, I will cauſe him to repent it, and be ſufficiently revenged on them both.</p>
               <p>So gallopped ſhe the ſame way ſhe came, and <hi>Belcar</hi> with <hi>Tirendos</hi> went into the Tent, where they diſcourſed together on many matters, <hi>Tirendos</hi> declaring how <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> was the other Knight that fought in the damoſels cauſe, for which the Prince was greatly offended with himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to wear away that conceit, acquainted <hi>Tirendos</hi> with his fortune at the Caſtle, and of the task he had taken in hand, which he liked ſo well, as he concluded likewiſe to bear him company. Thus <hi>Lypes</hi> and they two remained there together, oftentimes reſorting to viſit his mother and ſiſters, who would not ſuffer them to want any thing: And ſuch was the fame of <hi>Belcars</hi> victories, as the whole Realm of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and the Emperours Court of <hi>Greece,</hi> was cloyed with the dayly reports thereof. But here will we leave theſe Champions a while, and ſpeak of the good Knight <hi>Palmendos,</hi> ſon to the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Tharſus.</hi>

How <hi>Palmendos</hi> underſtanding that he was Son to the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> cauſed himſelf to be arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Knight: And how he intreated licence of the Queen his Mother to go ſee Constantinople, which at length very hardly he obtained, and what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened thereon.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Arefully did the Queen of <hi>Tharſus</hi> nouriſh her young ſon <hi>Palmendos,</hi> whom ſhe had by the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> when he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the exerciſe of Arms, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the Admiral <hi>Alfarano</hi> in the Realm of <hi>Paſmeria,</hi> as you may read in his worthy Hiſtory. This child, as he grew in years ſo did he increaſe in all vertuous behaviour, being unable to ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow his royal diſcent; yet to hinder his deſire from ſearch after his father (the Queen and all the Nobility ſo entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affecting him) no knowledge might be given him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, leſt by that mean he ſhould become a Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that he might be inſtructed in thoſe heroical qualities, which beſeem a Prince of ſo high calling, the Queen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to the charge of the Brother to the deceaſed King her husband, a Knight of great wisdom and valour; by whom he was ſo worthily educated, as he won the love of every one in general. Rigour he would requite with mercy and clemency, and charity he preferred in all his actions; notwithſtanding as he ſhewed courteous and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign countenance towards the good, ſo did he ſternly and ſeverely oppoſe himſelf againſt the bad, ſo that by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit prudence, and choiſe care in honourable cauſes, in his youth he would learn to manage the affairs of the Realm, wherein he ſhewed himſelf ſo quick of ſpirit, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52643:21"/>
ſuſceptible, as he waxed to be ſuch a politick Oeconomy, that the Queen intended to put the Royall Government into his hands. If he were thus enriched with all perfect vertues, nothing wanted in him for brave conſtitution of body, whereof he made no ſhew of pride or preſumption; but became ſo famous through all the neighbour Marches and limitrophes of <hi>Tharſus,</hi> as the very beſt would come to offer him their ſervice.</p>
               <p>The Court was filled with reſort of Nobles and others; for beſide the Royal Nature he brought from his Mothers womb, according to the <hi>Idea</hi> and celeſtial influence of his conſtellation, he was born and naturally inclined to Arms, which made him evermore converſe with the moſt skilful in that ſcience. But one day before he was armed Knight, a very aged, decrepit and over-ſpent woman came and ſate down on a ſtep in the Porch of the Palace, attired in ſuch poor garments, as her naked fleſh was ſeen in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and there ſate ſhe trembling in ſuch ſort, as though her ſoul were ready to forſake her body. Such as paſſed in and out the Court were greatly amazed hereat, and moved to pity her caſe very much ſo that <hi>Palmendos</hi> came himſelf to behold her; and ſeeing ſhe would uſe no ſpeeches to him, went in again and ſate down to dinner. Afterward, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth to walk abroad for his delight, he found her ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there ſtill in the ſame place, wherefore he called his Couſin <hi>Ozalio</hi> to him, who was ſon to his Vncle and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſaying. Can we not underſtand what this poor old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would have? <hi>Ozalio</hi> as deſirous as the Prince, came to the old woman, demanding of whence ſhe was, and if ſhe ſtood in need of any thing? But ſhe without anſwering one word, gave him a very frowning countenance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſcornfully turned her back towards him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Ozalio</hi> ſomewhat offended, did give her ſuch a ſpurn with his foot as ſhe tumbled quite beſide her ſeat, whereat <hi>Palmendos</hi> and his Lords merrily laughed: But their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime was quickly altered into admiration; for after the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52643:21"/>
woman aroſe again, ſhe ſéemed of ſuch huge deformed ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as each one was amazed that had beheld her before; and turning her ſelf angerly towards the Prince, ſhe uſed theſe ſpéeches.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Palmendos,</hi> little regardeſt thou to reſemble the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> thy father, whoſe gentleneſſe and ſwéetneſſe ſtretcheth as well to the meaneſt perſons, as them that are Lords, and of great account. What gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou in rejoycing at the injury done me by thy Knight? I pray that the great imperious Monarch <hi>Cupid</hi> (quoth ſhe, with lifting up her eys and hands to heaven) may ſo cruelly wound thy heart with the love of fair <hi>Francelina,</hi> and cauſe thee to conceive ſuch gracious thoughts of her, as thou mayeſt leave this idle and delicious life thou lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to win the honour that is gotten with pain and travel. So did thy father heretofore for the fair Princeſs <hi>Polynar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> whom he loved ſo religiouſly, as with the dexterity and ſtrength of his body, he aſſayed to gain the reward which Fortune provideth for her chiefeſt favourites; whereon imperially he is now mounted, accompanied with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt felicity, that can happen to any one under this Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere. Leave then theſe wanton and Courtly ſurfettings, wherein thy mother laboureth to contain thée, and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to manage Arms, which may make thy name perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and yéeld the reward of immortal glory: for it will redound to thy great ſhame, being ſon to ſo rare and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible a Knight, not this way to imitate his laborious déeds. And when I ſhall ſée thee throughly wrapped in the paſſions of love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wil think my ſelf ſatisfied with revenge of the diſhonour, which thou haſt ſuffered to be done to me in thy preſence.</p>
               <p>The old Woman ſo breaking off immediately vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, to the great terrour of all the beholders, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the young Prince <hi>Palmendos,</hi> whoſe ſences were for a while eſtranged; and walking up and down muſing on the old Womans words, his heart was ſo enflamed with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52643:22"/>
the love of her he knew not, as he was enforced thus to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune with himſelf. What may the Lady be with whom (at the report of this woman) I find my ſelf ſo diſtraught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Doubtleſs, if her words be no fables, but that I am ſon to the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> it behooves me to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize ſuch actions, as I may be judged ſomewhat to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him.</p>
               <p>While his ſpirit was thus buſied with diverſity of theſe thoughts and no one daring to interrupt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Ozalio</hi> went into the Quéens chamber, and telling what had happened, ſhe was therewith greatly diſpleaſed. Immediately ſhe came down into the great Hall, and finding her ſon thus perplexed, took him by the hand, cauſing him to ſit down by her, and then begun to him in this manner. I know not (my ſon) what follies it ſhould ſéem the old Hag hath trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled your mind withal; but refrain from giving credit to them and I ſhall tell you the very truth of all. Madam (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Palmendos</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) I am certain you will not dally with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding I cannot but marvel, that you would all this while conceal the original of my birth; for the Emperour <hi>Palmerin</hi> being ſuch a worthy accompliſhed Knight as he is eſtéemed of every one little occaſion have I of disdain to be his ſon, and you much leſſe to kéep it from me. Wherefore I humbly intreat your Majeſty, to reſolve me faithfully of this preſent doubt, to the end, if it be ſo, I may ſhew my ſelf forward in duty, in cauſing the bud to flouriſh that came from ſuch a noble and vertuous ſtalk. And fear not that for his ſake I will abandon you; becauſe it is impoſſible for me to leave the Law wherein I have hitherto lived, for a ſtrange opinion which I am ignorant in.</p>
               <p>Ah my ſon (quoth the Quéen) the Gods ſo inſpire and direct your deſigns that you may perfectly accompliſh what you have promiſed; for the onely fear to loſe your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hath cauſed me to conceal the thing you are ſo deſirous to know, But ſéeing you have heard what I can no longer
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52643:22"/>
diſſemble aſſure your ſelf my ſon, that the old woman hath told nothing but truth. Hereupon ſhe recounted the whole Hiſtory, how to have iſſue by ſuch a péerleſſe Prince, (imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> Queen of the Amazons, who for the like cauſe acquainted her ſelf with the valiant king <hi>Alexander</hi>) ſhe by the counſel of a wiſe Magician, amourouſly begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Emperour <hi>Palmerin.</hi> Laſtly, ſhe intreated him not to forſake her while ſhe lived, becauſe her life was onely prolonged by his preſence.</p>
               <p>Great matters have you told me (anſwered the young Prince:) the Emperour then knows not that he hath any child by you? No verily (replied the Quéen,) nor would I he ſhould know it for the whole world. Nor can he, I think underſtand it by any (ſaid the Prince;) yet, in mine opinion, I count it neceſſary that one day I ſhould go ſee my father: But truſt me Madam it ſhall not be without ſpeedy return, becauſe I am determined not to leave you, or give over (with my will) the Countrey and Kingdome which the heavens have appointed me to rule and govern. Thus reaſoned the mother and her ſon on divers matters; and henceforth the Prince ſhewed himſelf more chearfully diſpoſed, intending very ſhortly to be armed Knight and to be called the Knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> bearing for his Deviſe, an Heart wounded with an Arrow. For himſelf he provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an Armour as red as bloud; and for <hi>Ozalio</hi> whom he loved as his brother, a fair white Armour: and were both Knighted by <hi>Ozalio</hi> his father, who was one of the beſt Knights in all thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>Having thus received their order, a very ſolemn feaſt was made in honour thereof, during which time <hi>Palmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> gave away ſundry ſumptuous gifts: Yet could he not be unmindfull of <hi>Francelina,</hi> or forget one jot of the old Womans words, becauſe he had lodged them ſo near his heart, as they were (in manner) a martyrdom to him. For eaſe whereof he determined to ſee <hi>Greece,</hi> as alſo to viſite the Emperour his father, and learn ſome tidings of his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52643:23"/>
unknown Lady: for he perſwaded himſelf that the old Womans ſpeeches grew upon no ſmal occaſion. And fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Queen his mother one afternoon at good leiſure, among divers other proceedings between them, <hi>Palmendos</hi> earneſtly intreated her to grant him one requeſt: which the Queen (who loved him as her proper life, and not thinking he would have deſired any ſuch thing) agreed unto very willingly. Then would I good Madam quoth he) not have you conceive any diſpleaſure, if I make a brief voyage to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to ſee the Emperour my Father, and the good Knights in his Court: for ſince the time you aſſured me that I was his Son, my deſires have been unmeaſurable to travell this journey. Yet I ſwear by the ſincere and inviolable faith, which the Child above all other oweth to his Mother, to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with all poſſible ſpeed. Alas my Son (quoth the Queen, giving a bitter ſigh) your words have ſo ſharply pierced my heart, as me thinks I feel my very thread of life cut in ſunder, the fear of this preſent extremity, with-held me from uttering mine own ruine: but ſeeing I cannot hinder what I have willingly conſented to, with what patience I can I will bear my miſ-fortune. One thing yet would I commend to thee, if zeal and love to thy Mother may ſolicite any compaſſion: that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt return to the place of thy birth as ſoon as thou canſt, that mine eys beholding thee once more before I die, my ſoul may paſſe with greater comfort into another world. So help me God, anſwered <hi>Palmendos,</hi> as I intend not to break the leaſt of your commandements, nor will I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you in my ſhort and ſpeedy return. Sith then my ſon (quoth the Queen) you will needs undertake this voyage, I would adviſe you to have good ſtore of hardy Knights with you, that your entertainment by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour may be the more honourable. Madam (quoth he) I am certain my Lord will not eſteem any thing the more of me for my company, becauſe it ſhall ſuffice that I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52643:23"/>
am King of <hi>Tharſus</hi> wherein conſiſteth the point of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown: as for my pain in travell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome report of good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in Chivalry ſhall wipe that away. For (as you are not ignorant thereof) his Majeſty travelled alone through the world, oppoſing his unconquerable mind againſt all adventures whatſoever: yet did the divine bounty ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſhield him from peril &amp; death, and as he, ſo many other famous Kings &amp; Potentates. What enterpriſe was more dangerous then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of <hi>Jaſon,</hi> when he won the golden fléece in the Iſle of <hi>Cholcos?</hi> or that of the gentle Champion <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi> when he conquered the Minotaur in the inextricable Labyrinth of <hi>Creet</hi>? yet the Gods defended them in all their attempts. In my time (Mother) I have ſéen, that poor and ſimple ſhips have ſailed in the ſea, with great fortune in tempeſts and outrage, and at length have returned home richly furniſhed: on the contrary I have noted that ſundry gallant veſſels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have cut with full ſail through calm and quiet ſeas, favoured both with wind and weather, and at the very entrance of the Havens mouth, have ſplit on ſome Rock, or ſuſtained other miſchance. Néedleſſe then were my fear of the ſea or fortune, becauſe (where ere I go) death tracks me as my ſhadow, and dare not ſtrike till he be commanded: therefore I am thus determined to have none with me but <hi>Ozalio</hi> and two Squires, becauſe we will travell as mean Gentlemen, and try our manhood with the Knights of <hi>Europe,</hi> before the Emperour ſhall have any knowledge of me.</p>
               <p>The Queen would no more contrary his intent, but referred all things to his own diſpoſing, wherefore <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendos</hi> having ſent for the chief Lords of the Realm, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to them openly his mind: giving them this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe charge, to obey the Queen his Mother, and his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, whom he left as Lievtenant General of the Province in his abſence. They all ſorry that he would ſo ſoon depart knew not how to hinder it, he being ſo reſolute: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, they promiſed to fulfill his command,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52643:24"/>
wiſhing him a tranquile and proſperous navigation. Soon after the Q. went into her Cabinet, where her hand ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the office of her tongue, ſhe wrote a friendly letter to the Emperour, which ſhe accompanied with a ring, like to that ſhe gave him at his departure: to the end that by this Iewel, <hi>Palmendos</hi> might be the ſooner known of him.</p>
               <p>Ship and all things ready for this voyage, he took his leave of his Lords and ſubjects, &amp; afterward of the Queen his mother, who biting in her grief as well as ſhe could, delivered him the Ring and the Letter, the contents wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thus followeth.</p>

Once more I conjure ye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the honour and reverence of the firm love, you alwaies bear ſo religiouſly to the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miſtreſſe of your heart, that you will quickly return our ſon again, that he may yet be ſome comfort to my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing date of time, while I enjoy my being in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Region.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. How <hi>Palmendos</hi> by means of a Tempeſt on the ſea, was brought to the Iſle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> where after he underſtood the adventure of the Temple, he went on ſhore. And how after he conquered the ſon to the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Baledon,</hi> who held the Iſland in forcible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Almendos</hi> with <hi>Ozalio</hi> &amp; their Squires embarqued, the Mariners hoiſed ſail and ſet away merrily, the Prince commanding the Pilot to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Thrace,</hi> becauſe he hoped to hear ſome tidings of <hi>Francelina,</hi> whom he had made chief miſtreſſe of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. But after they had ſailed half a day a violent contrary wind aroſe, which drove them three days and three nights, as the Mariners could ſcant tell in what part they were. At length this rough and boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous tempeſt ceaſed, when <hi>Palmendos</hi> deſirous to know in what countrey they were: was anſwered by the Maſter, that they were in <hi>Europe</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranian</hi> ſea, very near to the Iſle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> where after ſo long and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable weather, <hi>Palmendos</hi> would go on land to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelf. In this Iſle the Pagans were often wont in ancient time, to come and viſit the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> as alſo to conſult with his Oracle; and at this time was Lord thereof a Giant named <hi>Baledon,</hi> the moſt fierce and cruell Tyrrant in all thoſe three parts of the world. This Gyant had a ſon no leſſe valiant then himſelf, and after he had by force gotten this Iſland, he builded a ſtrong Caſtle on a little Promontorie, deſcending ſo artificially into the ſea, as having a huge Rock on either ſide, it was well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52643:25"/>
from the extremity of the water. No other port for landing would he permit in all the Iſland, then this only, he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med in with the two Rocks, between which he had faſtened a great chain of iron, which commonly lay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhallow in the water. But when any veſſel came to anchor in that port, certain villains which he kept in Towers for the purpoſe, would hoiſe them up with the chain in ſuch ſort, that they could depart no more thence except the Giant pleaſed: and thus would he roh and ſpoil all that landed there, that all thoſe parts lamented to hear of his villany. If happily he met with any Knights who reſiſted his will then would he outrage them by force of Arms, and afterward put them into an infectious ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priſon. The Merchants and others that uſed traffck, from them would he take all they had, and afterward deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them over unto a moſt cruell death, ſo that all ſuch as had notice of his tyranny, fled that place as the dangerous gulf of <hi>Caribdis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding there was in this Iſland a great adventure, for in the time of the Gentiles, there inhabited a wealthy Prieſt, a Magitian, and wonderfull inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of hidden things, he was high Prieſt of the Sanctuary in the Temple, as alſo he had the general adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through the whole Province: he having a comely beautifull daughter, indued with all vertues requiſite in a Virgin, and her he gave to the ſervice of the Oracle. It ſo fell out, that the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> a very gentle and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous youth, became enamoured of her onely by report, for oftentimes he had heard her comended, to excéed in beauty the choiceſt dames of that Countrey: wherefore he made ſundry requeſts to injoy her as his Wife, but all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was to no purpoſe, becauſe her father would not part with her. And as it often happeneth, that the Meſſenger who is twice or thrice ſent to one place, to obtain a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter earneſtly deſired, will deviſe what means he can for the behoof of his Maſter, more to eſcape the ſhame of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52643:26"/>
then for any great good will (happily) to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: even ſo fell it out with the miniſter of this ſute, for ſéeing he went and returned ſo often without avail, he got one day to ſpeak with the Maiden her ſelf, whom he laboured with ſo many perſwaſions, and whetted on to <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>n in a ſecret marriage, as ſhe became raviſhed with the love of the Duke, and promiſed if his maſter could cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly ſteal her from her father, ſhe ſhould go with him whither he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>The Duke not a little glad of this anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preſently journied to the Iſland, where being arrived, he advertiſed the damoſell, that he would ſtay for her in a convenient place near her fathers Pallace, whither ſhe ſhould not fail to come, ſo ſoon as the ſilent night had brought every one aſléep. But the Prieſt, who by means of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick foreſaw all theſe practiſes, and knowing the place where the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> ſtayed for his daughter: cauſed two fierce inchanted Lions to diſcend from the mountains which came with ravenous mouths on the unprovided Duke, and he no way able to defend himſelf, they rent and tore him cruelly in pieces. Which pittiful ſpectacle when his Squire that came with him beheld, he gave ſuch a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſhriek, as the damoſel (whoſe eys and ears were carefully waking) eaſily heard it. In like ſort did divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the houſe, who came forth with lighted torches to underſtand the cauſe, but the maiden hearing too ſoon in what caſe they found the Duke, came running from the Caſtle as a mad Woman to accompliſh the Sacrifice. Such was her grief to behold her vowed Husband thus cruelly maſſacred, as ſhe taking his Rapier, ſet the pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel thereof to the ground, and placing the point oppoſite to her heart, with marvellous violence threw her ſelf thereon as one diſdaining to live, being robbed of her love. Nevertheleſſe, ſhe was herein deceived, for the Sword paſſing through her right ſide, ſhe fell upon the dead corps and ſo lay a while alive, breathing forth many grievous
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52643:26"/>
ſighs and lamentations. And finding in her boſome a ſhéet of paper, with her own bloud ſhe wrote twelve mournfull verſes in form of an Epitaph: then ſéeing her lateſt hour to haſten on, with rufull mones ſhe delivered theſe ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Séeing it is ſo, my ſwéet choice, and paragon of courteſie, that for my ſake thou haſt endured this martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it will remain as a gall in my conſcience, that I did not end thy funeralls according to thy deſert. And that my father may know what wrong he hath done us, I will leave ſome occaſion for his too late repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no other recompence, but cauſing our bodies to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in one Coffin, he will ſuffer (for a perpetual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this ſtratagem) this Epitaph to be engraven thereon.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Forbear mine eyes more to bemone thy friend,</l>

                  <l>Ah angry fate, and Planet moſt unkind,</l>
                  <l>What more in humane act could ye deviſe:</l>
                  <l>Then ſtep between the heart, the eye, and mind,</l>
                  <l>And pierce that vein which could them all ſuffice?</l>
                  <l>But fith in life our fortune was ſo bad,</l>
                  <l>To miſſe of that which we deſired moſt:</l>

                  <l>Wherefore of love in death we make our boaſt.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This Epitaph ended, ſhe yéelded the humane tribute to nature, for afterward her body made no motion of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall moving: and it cannot be eſtéemed as fabulous that love ſhould cauſe the death of any one, becauſe in ancient Hiſtories, we may find innumerable of recent and modern examples thereof. But return we to the Prieſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that his daughter ran forth with ſuch a cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, followed her immediately, fearing ſhe would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52643:27"/>
ſome violence on her ſelf, and finding her dead, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Epitaph in her hand, he was in great danger to make a third in this wofull tragedy. Ah miſerable and deſolate wretch (quoth he) if thy knowledge had efficacy in working the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi>'s death why was it not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prevent thy daughters miſhap? unhappy was the hour when firſt I practiſed this divelliſh ſorcery.</p>
               <p>Many other ſorrowfull lamentations he made over the dead bodies whom we may aptly compare to the loyal lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Piramus</hi> and <hi>Thisby</hi>: but afterward he erected a coſtly Sepulchre of braſs, and having embalmed them according to the ancient ceremonies of funeral pomp, he intombed them in the Temple both together, and cauſed the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph to be cunningly graven thereon. Not long after, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering himſelf deprived of his lawfull heir, and how greatly he had perverted the courſe of nature very extream grief ended his daies: but ere he died, he incloſed the treaſure of the Temple with ſuch enchantments, and with ſo ſtrong and fearfull a guard, that from the time of his death it was very dangerous to come near the place. And till the time of <hi>Palmendos</hi> arrivall there, there durſt not any one make tryall thereof, albeit before <hi>Baledon</hi> abuſed the Iſland, Knights of divers Regions came to prove their fortune: and the Giant himſelf came thither for the ſame occaſion, but ſéeing he could not approach the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perceiving the Iſland to be fair and delectable: he got it by force of arms, the people thereof being unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his hoſtility.</p>
               <p>Let us now remember where we left before, the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of <hi>Palmendos</hi> in this Iſland of <hi>Delphos,</hi> to whom one of the Marriners told all theſe things, as alſo the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble villainy of the Giant: wherefore he intreated him not to anchor in that Port, becauſe (quoth he) we ſhall all be either ſlain or taken priſoners. Why? ſaid <hi>Palmendos</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is no man able to puniſh his pride and tyranny? ſéeing Fortune hath conducted me hither, and will permit
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52643:27"/>
me to have a ſight of him I will not depart without ſome proof of my ſelf; for if I be ſon to the Emperor <hi>Palmerin,</hi> I muſt not be frighted with the name of Giants who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſemble huge <hi>Coloſſes</hi> without any ſouls, then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane creatures, much leſſe ſtrange adventures, how hard and dangerous ſoever they ſéem. If I would acquire praiſe and honour immortal, long time muſt I follow military exerciſe, as my father did in his younger days, prevailing againſt divers ſuch Monſters, and bringing innumerable enterprizes to happy end: Turn prow then toward ſhore, and boldly let us enter the Port, without any fear of this deformed <hi>Goliah.</hi> With much adoe they ſet into the Port, where they were no ſooner entred, but they ſaw themſelves encloſed with the chain; which ſight diſmayed both the Maſter and Mariners, but <hi>Palmendos</hi> and <hi>Ozalio</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put on their Helmets and Gantlets, ſtanding ready for defence of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Giant being advertiſed that a rich ſhip was got within the chain, commanded his ſon preſently to take Arms, and with ſufficient aſſiſtants to go and take all the ſtrangers priſoners; whereto the young Tyrant was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ready; and entring with thrée Knights into a boat, he came directly to the ſhip, where <hi>Palmendos</hi> ſtanding fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, the Giants ſon thus ſpake to him. How dareſt thou, Knight, be ſo bold, as to enter our Port without licence? I dare do more then that (anſwered <hi>Palmendos</hi>) in deſpight of ſuch diſloyal villains as you are, who by treacherous means intrap the innocent, and afterward exerciſe what cruelty you pleaſe upon them; but now is the time come, I hope that ſhall guerdon you with recompence anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch brutiſh behaviour.</p>
               <p>The Giants ſon diſpleaſed with theſe words, ſought with his Knights to enter violently the ſhip: But <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendos</hi> and <hi>Ozalio</hi> being too high above them, gave them ſo many ſharp repulſes, that young <hi>Baledon</hi> received his deaths wound at the Princes hand, and <hi>Ozalio</hi> ſent one of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52643:28"/>
the Knights to bear him company. With this foyl the boat ſpéedily returned, and they advertiſed <hi>Baledon</hi> of what had happened, bringing his ſon ſlain up into his chamber; wherewith he was ſo wonderfully enraged, that he vowed to revenge his blood with the death of all the ſtrangers. In bitter anguiſh of heart, he called for his Armour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himſelf to the diſmal attempt; in the mean time, the two Knights that eſcaped back alive, ſtood on the ſhore reviling the Prince, willing him to prepare, for his death was comming.</p>
               <p>If your Maſter (quoth <hi>Palmendos</hi>) be ſo valiant as you report let him deal alone with me in ſingle fight, and if I chance to vanquiſh him, let him accompliſh what I ſhall ſet down and I will grant him life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On the contrary, if he conquer me let him do with me and mine as him plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Tell him that Bravadoes and proud ſpéeches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not daunt reſolute minds; and if he dare grant me ſafe conduct, with good aſſurance not to offer me any wrong, I will preſently come on ſhore, and try my fortune with him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. How <hi>Palmendos</hi> came on land to combat with the Giant <hi>Baledon,</hi> whom he vanquiſhed, and afterward delivered many Knights out of his priſons, among whom were two young Princes, being Moors, who in travelling to the Emperours Court, were by a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest cast on this Iſland.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight ſoon went the Knights to the Giant with <hi>Palmendos</hi> challenge, who being very well pleaſed therewith, came down proudly to the Port, with theſe ſpéeches. Which is the wretched Knight, that dares ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily venture on ſhore, to receive the death
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52643:28"/>
he hath juſtly deſerved? I am the man (anſwered <hi>Palmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi>) and I will be ſo good as my word, if thou wilt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promiſe me ſafety from thy people. By the hallowed faith (ſaid <hi>Baledon</hi>) that I owe to our Gods, thou ſhalt be as ſecure as thou canſt require, albeit I die under thy ſword in combat.</p>
               <p>The Prince loth to waſte the time in words, called for a skiff to carry him on ſhore, which the Mariners unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conſented to, being loth to loſe a Knight ſo valiant. In brief, he came on land, and no one with him but his couſin <hi>Ozalio,</hi> who would not at any time forſake his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. <hi>Baledon</hi> pranceth up to the plain before his Caſtle, commanding his attendants on pain of their lives, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way to trouble or moleſt his enemy. Now are the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions covered with their ſwords and ſhields, and with ſuch fury do the weapons claſh upon the Armour, as though <hi>Vulcan</hi> and his <hi>Cyclops</hi> were at work with their hammers. You muſt think that the Giant being a man of monſtrous ſtature, dealing with a young Prince, but a griſtle (in a manner) in compariſon of him, did often bring his life to very perilous exigents: Notwithſtanding ſo did the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens favour <hi>Palmendos,</hi> and deſpiſe the manifold tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Giant, as after a long, cruel and bloudy fight, <hi>Baledon</hi> had received ſo many wounds, as he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fall at the Princes mercy; for which <hi>Palmendos</hi> humbly thanking heaven, boldly ſet his foot upon the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, ſaying. Confeſſe thy ſelf, <hi>Baledon</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vanquiſhed by me, and let me enjoy the priſoners which thou unjuſtly detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in thy Caſtle, for the remainder of thy life hangeth on the point of my ſword.</p>
               <p>When the Giant beheld his great pomp ſo overthrown, and he had no mean now left wherewith to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he breathed forth theſe ſorrowfull ſpéeches. Ah angry Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how ſtrange and divers are your judgements, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering both me and my ſon to be foyled by one Knight? Now ſée I well, that mine infinite and wicked offences
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52643:29"/>
committed againſt men without deſert, hath thrown this wreakfull ſentence on me. Then calling his ſervants, he comanded them to conduct the Prince into the Caſtle, and deliver all his priſoners to him, with any thing elſe he ſhould command them.</p>
               <p>So went the Prince with his couſin <hi>Ozalio</hi> and two of the Giants ſervants to the Caſtle, the reſt remained to bring their Maſters dead body, and when they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the baſe Court, they met the Gianteſſe heavily lamenting and curſing the Knight who was cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But <hi>Palmendos</hi> made no account of her words, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all the priſoners to be preſently brought before him, which indéed were very many, both Knights, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and other travelling ſtrangers, who had long time béen kept there in captivity; and now ſéeing they were ſo generally called, they verily thought to die, or endure ſome cruel torment; but finding the contrary, I leave their joy to the Readers judgement. Then <hi>Palmendos</hi> called for the Knights Armour, that each one knowing his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour might be armed therewith, For this their happy deliverance, they all fel down at the Princes féet, deſiring God to reward his honourable pains.</p>
               <p>But among the priſoners, there were two young knights of comely ſtature, being both Moors, who had not long time béen held in that ſervitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and witneſſing by their countenances that they were deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of royal parentage. The one of them was <hi>Rifarano,</hi> ſon to <hi>Trineus</hi> Emperour of <hi>Almain,</hi> and <hi>Aurecinda</hi> the Soldans ſiſter, as you may read in the Hiſtory of <hi>Palmerin d' Oliva</hi>; the other was named <hi>Lecefin,</hi> ſon to the Soldan of <hi>Perſia,</hi> being the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of thrée which he had by the Princeſs <hi>Zephira.</hi> Theſe two young Lords were nouriſhed together by the Soldan, becauſe he beheld the towardly inclination of <hi>Rifarano,</hi> whom he ever imagined would prove a worthy Knight: and becauſe he was ſon to his ſiſter, and the Emperour <hi>Trineus</hi> his great friend, he loved him as <hi>Lecefin</hi> his own
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52643:29"/>
child. <hi>Rifarano</hi> comming to the age of ten or twelve years, waxed very forward in all commendable exerciſes, and one day reaſoning with his mother, deſired her to tell him the cauſe, why ſhe went ſo continually clad in mourning, the truth whereof ſhe diſcourſed to him, and how his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Emperour <hi>Trineus</hi> of <hi>Almaign.</hi> When <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farano</hi> underſtood that he was ſon to one of the chiefeſt Princes in Chriſtendome, he made greater account of himſelf then he did before, and diſpoſed himſelf to matters of higher quality, ſo that being of years to receive his Knighthood, he requeſted the Soldan to honour him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: which he with right good will performed, cauſing Iouſts and Tournaments to ſolemnize that time withall, wherein <hi>Rifarano</hi> ſtill bare away the prize. Following arms and chivalry he ſtil continued, and with good ſucceſs won ſuch fame through all <hi>Perſia,</hi> as the Soldan thought to join him in marriage with the King <hi>Maulerino's</hi> eldeſt daughter. But he would never hearken to ſuch matters for that he had ſecretly vowed to ſée the Emperour his father, whereto his Mother (whoſe days long ſickneſſe had now ſhortned) evermore provoked him that <hi>Trineus</hi> beholding the fruit of her love, might think the better of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with her.</p>
               <p>After the obſequies and royall funeral, as well beſéem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Princeſſe of ſo great regard, and <hi>Rifarano</hi> loth to ſtay, his mother being dead: he deſired the Soldan that he might travell to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to ſée the Court of the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and thence he would go to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Almaign.</hi> Albeit very unwilling, yet the Soldan condiſcended, whereat the young Prince <hi>Lecefin,</hi> who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Rifarano</hi> as himſelf, began to conceive great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: wherefore he intreated his father, that he might travell with him in company, perſwading him that it would be a cauſe of his couſins more ſpéedy return. The Soldan liked hereof very well, and although he was yet very young, he gave him his Knighthood: and ſo with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52643:30"/>
preſents from his father and <hi>Zephira,</hi> as alſo Letters to both the Emperours, accompanied with thirty hardy Knights they took ſhipping, and by means of an excéeding rough tempeſt on the Sea, they were driven perforce into this Iſle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> where being hemmed in with the Chain, and flattered by the Gyant to come on ſhore, without ſuſpecting any treaſon they went to his Caſtle, and finding outward friendly entertainment, they were fetched forth of their beds and thruſt into priſon, and twenty of the Knights that came with them cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, the reſt were brought into the Dungeon to their Maſters and afterward the Giant took the ſpoil of the ſhip at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But to come to our purpoſe, <hi>Rifarano</hi> and <hi>Lecefin</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves delivered from this dolorous life, much worſe then that of the ſlaves of the Gallies they ſpake to <hi>Palmendos</hi> in this manner. Tell us in courteſie, good Knight, by what means you have obtained our liberty? for we marvel we ſée not the Giant who brought us hither by villany and treaſon. Gentlemen (quoth the Prince) I am a Knight born far hence, and being by the angry ſeas caſt upon this Iſland, I determined to come on ſhore, where being no way able to eſcape the death preſent before mine eyes, I was conſtrained to Combate with the Giant you talk of, who to allure me the ſooner to the battell, promiſed me ſecurity from any ſave himſelf. But hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven giving me ſtrength, to erect a mortal Trophie of his ſlaughtered body, hath thereby given you all fréedome again.</p>
               <p>Might we not ſaid <hi>Rifarano,</hi> know your name to whom we are ſo much indebted for our deliverance? as for us it is neceſſary you ſhould know of whence and what we are, that if we ſhould hereafter grow ingratefull for this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the meaneſt in the world might juſtly condemn us. This young Prince (quoth he) is named <hi>Lecefin,</hi> Son to the noble Soldan of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and I his unworthy Nephew,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52643:30"/>
iſſued from <hi>Trineus</hi> Emperour of Almaign, brother by marriage to the incomparable Prince <hi>Palmerin d' Oliva</hi>: hereto he added the whole diſcourſe of their trouble, which you have heard already. In happy time came I hither, anſwered <hi>Palmendos,</hi> to ſuccour ſo good and noble knights as you are, chiefly for your near alliance to the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> whom I continually deſire to ſerve, and ſhortly ſhall preſent my ſelf unto him: but firſt (by the favour of Fortune) I would have his ears ſo acquainted with ſome actions of account as might move his ſpirit with the more affection to ſée me. And ſéeing you go ſo ſoon to his Court, let me intreat this favour at your hands, as to conduct this company with you which I have delivered from priſon, and preſent his Majeſty with them from me, as alſo the wife and daughter of <hi>Baledon</hi> the Gyant: for it is both juſt and reaſonable, to diſpoſſeſſe this Iſland of ſuch bad people, as have with ſuch horrible tyrannies ſo long time abuſed the ſame. For I dare ſay, the people that inhabit this Iſle, will more gladly ſubmit themſelves to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Regiment, then be held in ſlavery by ſuch Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds. In mean while we will leave ſome good Knight of this ſoil as Governour thereof in his highneſſe name, untill he have diſpoſed thereof as ſhall ſéem beſt in his wiſedom. Willingly would I make proof before your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of a ſtrange adventure couched in the Temple: that if I die in the attempt, you may revenge my death, and happily live to finiſh the ſame. <hi>Rifarano</hi> and <hi>Lecefin</hi> made anſwer, that they would fulfill any thing he pleaſed to command them, for which <hi>Palmendos</hi> requited them with many thanks.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter all the Knights and Gentlemen had armed themſelves, <hi>Palmendos</hi> cauſed the Gianteſſe and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be faſtned with a ſtrong chain to a pillar, leſt they ſhould offer ſome violence on themſelves, &amp; the chain in the port he comanded to be taken away, with all other dangers that might hurt travellers, then ſummoning the people of the Iſland, he thus began to confer with them.</p>
               <p>My Brethren and friends, I cannot think but you all rejoice to ſée your ſelves delivered from the miſerable ſervitude, wherein the Tyrant <hi>Baledon</hi> hath long time held you; henceforth therefore I intend, that you ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for your liege Lord and Soveraign the famous and vertuous Emperour <hi>Palmerin d' Oliva,</hi> to whom I will make preſent of this Iſland which the God of heaven hath ſuffered me to conquer: for you know the Gyant is ſlain, his wife and daughter likewiſe remain my priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to his Majeſty will I ſhortly ſend them. Let me therefore intreat you, to continue his true and loyall Subjects, and I ſhall ſo behave my ſelf with his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as he ſhall henceforth defend this Iſland and you: for the government whereof in mean while, I will leave one that ſhall be choſen among you, who ſhallſwear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52643:31"/>
his office to him whom the Emperour ſhall pleaſe to ſend hither.</p>
               <p>The Knights and Gentlemen of the Iſland were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contented, when they heard <hi>Palmendos</hi> uſe ſuch graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpéeches, acknowledging themſelves happy to remain the Emperours vaſſals; whereupon they ſware fidelity to him, and elected a reverend Knight of the Iſland, named <hi>Guillador,</hi> to whom the authority of Deputy was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and then they cauſed the Giants body to be burned, for the horrible villanies he had done in his life time, to which execution all the people of the Iſland reſorted, not ſo much for the ſight thereof, as to honour the patron of their deliverance.</p>
               <p>Every thing thus wiſely and diſcréetly pacified, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to try the adventure of the Temple, whereupon the new Governour deſired him, not to hazard himſelf in a matter ſo perilous, for that many Knights had loſt their lives in the attempt; which made <hi>Palmendos</hi> far more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know wherein the greateſt danger thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, at whoſe requeſt <hi>Guillador</hi> thus began the diſcourſe. Know, my Lord, that the Temple wherein our Prieſts great treaſure is hid is a place now overgrown as a thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of young trées, by reaſon of the long time ſince any one durſt approach the ſame; and in that wood is a ſavage wild Boar, of more cruel nature certain then that which <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> ſlew on the Mountain <hi>Erymanthus</hi> in <hi>Arcadia</hi>: And when any one doth offer to enter the Temple he commeth forth of his den, and maketh him ſure for ever returning again. In ſooth (quoth the Prince) theſe news are very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in hearing, yet never was there any adventure in the world ſo difficult, but one or other hath accompliſhed it and I truſting onely in the help of God, will try if this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment were ordained perpetual, not fearing all the Boars or divels in the world.</p>
               <p>I am ſure, my Lord, (quoth <hi>Rifarano</hi>) that if you finiſh not this enchantment, it will never be accompliſhed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52643:32"/>
other, therefore boldly ſet upon it, for gladly would I endure part of the pain: and by the faith of a true Knight, I ſhall aſſiſt you with my uttermoſt endeavour. No other help do I deſire (anſwered <hi>Palmendos</hi>) then the favour of the Gods onely, and I hope they will not be far from me, if ſo I ſtand in néed thereof; notwithſtanding I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thank you for your good will, and if I happen to fail in mine enterprize, you ſhall make no better witneſſe of your words, then courteouſly to hazard the adventure, to recover the honour loſt by me; for which cauſe, as alſo to beguile the tediouſneſſe of travel, you ſhall accompany me to the Temple. So willing the Merchants and other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to ſtay in the Caſtle, <hi>Palmendos, Ozalio, Rifarano, Lecefin.</hi> and the reſt of the Knights being all well armed, ſet toward the Temple, many of the Iſland travelling with them to guide them the way, and do other néedfull ſervices.</p>
               <p>Now had <hi>Palmendos</hi> cauſed to be made by marvellous ſubtil cunning, a coat of Arms, compoſed of wax, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like clammy mixtures, wherewith he covered all his Armour, that the ſharp briſtles and tusks of the Boar might have no power to hurt him: And in this ſort they rode on together. Being at length come to a convenient place, which was within ſight of the Temple, he beheld the bruſhie thornie plain, which made him doubt how he ſhould get thither with his horſe. Yet reſolute for all chances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he takes an Iron Mace that he had brought from the Giants Caſtle, and forward goes to the Temple, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all his companions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that not one of them ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; wherewith <hi>Ozalio</hi> and <hi>Rifarano</hi> were ſomewhat offended, yet being loth to break his commandement, they ſtayed, uſing hearty and zealous invocations for his good ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmendos</hi> making way with his Mace through the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted briars, eſpied a Knight before him, who preſently winded a mighty horn, at the ſound whereof the ugly and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52643:32"/>
monſtrous Boar came forth of his den, and ran before the Temple gate, there ſtaying for <hi>Palmendos,</hi> with ſuch horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grinning of his tusks, as the very ſight thereof was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to fray a man of good courage. By this time the Prince gained a convenient place by the Temple ſide, when beholding the cruel beaſt come running fiercely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, he commended himſelf to the heavens, and fell to his work. So thick a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hall ſlew the enchanted briſtles from the Boar at the Prince; but the coat of wax ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded their ſtrength as they could not pierce his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which onely had been the death of many Knights before: But the Prince gave the beaſt ſuch ſuch a ſound ſtroke with the Mace on the head, as he ſtaggered to and fro, unable to ſuſtain himſelf; and following this good advantage, thruſt his ſword ſo déep down his throat, as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting forth a great deal of bloud upon the Prince, at length he tumbled down on his ſide, when half a dozen good ſtrokes with the Mace, made him ſafe for ſtirring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. And although this was a natural Boar, yet had he been diveliſhly enchanted, and brought into that place by the Prieſts Magick, as the Lions were that killed the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi>: this Boar was appointed by him to guard his treaſure in the Temple, which (as you hear) was ſlain by the hand of <hi>Palmendos.</hi> And even as the Boar of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that was ſent to torment the whole Countrey, died by the valour of <hi>Meleager,</hi> who after made a preſent of his head to the fair <hi>Atalanta,</hi> as a notable experience of his magnanimity in like ſort did the Prince of <hi>Tharſus,</hi> as a remembrance to all that ſhould come thither, cut off the Boars head, and as a trophie of his victory ſet it on a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the ſame place where he obtained it. He had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner put off his coat of wax, which was well laden with the Boars briſtles, but he ſaw the Knight of the Horn come towards him with a huge Mace in his hand ſaying. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy was thy comming (Knight) into this Deſart, when thou muſt buy thy boldneſſe with thy deareſt bloud. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52643:33"/>
he gave the Prince ſuch a cruel blow, as made him ſet one knée to the ground, and ſo long endured the ſharp ſight betwéen them, as they both being far ſpent and over-laboured, fell down to the ground, not able to ſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmendos</hi> in ſhort time recovering ſtrength, aroſe, and ſeeing his enemy was not to be found, boldly went to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Temple, the gates whereof ſtood now wide open, which greatly augmented his deſire to enter. Being come within the porch, two Images of braſſe ſtood on either ſide, who with monſtrous trumpets blew ſuch forcible wind on him, as he was three or four times carried forth again therewith: but preſſing on ſtill with all the ſtrength he had, he got ſuch ſure footing within the Temple, as he felt no more of that violent wind. Paſſing forward in the body of the Church, he came to the magnificent Sepulchre wherein the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> and the high Prieſts daughter were interred, which was ſo rich, ſumptuous, and rarely invented, as he had never ſeen the like before.</p>
               <p>Having read the Epitaph he eſpied the ſword where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the moſt perfect Damoſel in love had ſlain her ſelf; then mounting on the bars that invironed the Tomb, he took the ſword in his hand, and in remembrance of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, as alſo for the beauty thereof, he hung the ſame at his girdle determining to take it with him, and ſo walked higher to find out the treaſure. At length he came to the Sanctuary, where ſtood the ancient coſtly Altar for the ſacrifice, having thereon an Idol of maſſie gold upon the head whereof was a moſt rich Imperial Crown, and in his right hand a Scepter ſo curiouſly framed, that it was impoſſible to ſee Iewels of greater price. In the Idols other hand was a Book faſt ſealed with four great buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of gold; and in ſuch a marvellouſly coſtly Chair was the Image ſet, as nature her ſelf would have been driven into admiration, to behold a matter of ſuch ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing excellency. All about the Altar ſtood many Baſons
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52643:33"/>
of Gold, and before it hung divers images of ſilver with lighted Lamps, from whence came ſuch a ſweet ſmell of Myrrhe and other Aromatick drugs, and the light cauſed the precious ſtones in the Idol ſo to gliſter, as it would have raviſhed any eye to note the Majeſty thereof. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendos</hi> carried away with contemplating this ſight, and not able to withdraw his eye from gazing thereon: at length beheld the dark night to draw on, the Lamps in this holy conclave having ſo beguiled him, wherefore he concluded not to depart thence till the morning, that he might behold the other ſingularities of the place.</p>

               <p>Am I not more wretched and unfortunate, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

under the Globe of heaven? yes queſtionleſſe, ſéeing the fatall Deſtinies hath appointed me to endure perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cruell and rigorous martyrdomes, for thy ſake noble Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> the onely record of mine afflicted ſoul, for whom love took ſuch priviledge on me, as I feared not to offend my ſelf with mine own hand. But who hath robbed one of the Sword that ſo ſuddenly made the ſad execution of my life? Ah <hi>Palmendos,</hi> think not to carry it away ſo lightly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that ſword is yet more neceſſary for me. With theſe words ſhe ran violently upon him, and ſhook him as if ſhe would have torn him in pieces: at which inſtant there aroſe ſuch a thunder and trembling of the earth, as he thought verily the Temple would have ſunk, and the four elements reſolve and turn into their former ſtate of Chaos. By reaſon whereof the Prince could not continue his magnanimous and wonted vigour, but fell down depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his underſtanding, as though pale death had taken poſſeſſion of him. During this trance, a fair Virgin richly accouſtred (whom the old woman that told him of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things at <hi>Tharſus,</hi> had ſent thither by her Poſt) came and took him by the hand, ſaying.</p>
               <p>Ariſe <hi>Palmendos</hi> my noble Lord, and come to her, who ſéeing the fearfull ſtate wherein you are, onely by fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies repreſented to your eyes, do intreat you not to diſable your heroical and noble courage, at the ſight of vain and fantaſtical viſions, for it beſeemeth not ſo good and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed Knights, as you are, in ſuch ſort to paſſe through ſtrange adventures: Be of good chear then, and repute this hour of your renown, to ſurpaſſe all the braveſt men in the world: becauſe ſince the eſſence of this enchantment, no Knight could enter this Temple but you alone. Wherefore by good reaſon ought the treaſure to be yours, which hath ſo long time béen concealed here: take hence then the Golden Idol on the Altar, with all the other rich and precious jewels, and ſend them to the vertuous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour your Father. And for your ſake ſhall this temple hereaf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52643:34"/>
be frequent and acceſſable for any, which you ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate to the name of Chriſt, and of the treaſure you ſhall yet find, you ſhall erect a Monaſtery of Virgins, in honour of that incontaminate maiden, that brought the Saviour of al mankind into the world, who hath given you ſtrength to run through theſe actions, that this place may be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and devoutly uſed, which heretofore hath been blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed with Idolatry contrary to the bounty inexpuiſable, making to ſinfull men vows, offerings, and ſacrifices. And albeit you are not as yet a Chriſtian, yet for my ſake enter that unſpotted faith, for the time will come, wherein you ſhall ſundry times ſay, happy was that hour wherein you found me. Having taken good order for all that I have ſaid, contain your ſelf no longer in theſe countries, becauſe in other climats is reſerved a tryumphal Scepter for you, inriched with honour and eternal praiſes.</p>
               <p>In vain it were to ask, if <hi>Palmendos</hi> was filled with great marvell, hearing the damoſels voice, who came to comfort him in this auſtere calamity, and could ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher his affairs, for the extaſie and radiſhment of his ſpirit, which evidently appeared in his countenance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered ample teſtimony thereof. Nor were theſe words any thing elſe but fuel to encreaſe loves fire already burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: nevertheleſſe, ſéeing himſelf in a place ſo commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, where fréely he might hold that with this Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he called up his ſpirits, and boldly made this anſwer. Madam, for the reverend honour you bear to your God, conceal not who you are that know me ſo well, intreating you to pardon my preſumptuous requeſt, becauſe your rare and perfect beauty, which is the onely ſpur to my demand, hath confounded me with greater admiration then all the ſtrange ſights I have yet beheld: all which, (in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of your excellence) I hold as diabolical and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for you ſéem celeſtial and ſent by the Gods into theſe nether Regions, where having diſcovered the future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of my deſtinies, my heart hath thereby received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52643:35"/>
joy and contentment. Be not abaſhed courteous Knight (quoth ſhe) at any thing I have ſaid, for it is long ſince I knew what I have uttered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in regard of your worthy valour, I love and eſtéem ye above all other in the world, ſo that I have left the Countries of my ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal onely to ſée and tell ye what I have done, deſiring you to excuſe me in the reſt, as concealing of whence and what I am, becauſe at this time you cannot be ſatisfied therewith, yet ere it be long we will méet again, and then ſhall you underſtand more of me, by one requeſt I muſt make to you, which as yet may not be manifeſted. Wonderfull will that conſolation be (quoth the Prince) to me, that you will command any thing wherein I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe my forces, and in that devotion, I have vowed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore faithfully to continue your friend: offering in witneſſe of this obeiſance, to ſerve henceforth as your Knight, with promiſe not to prejudice the leaſt of your commandements, ſo long as my ſtars give me leave to breath. Nor will I further preſſe you to tell me what you are, ſéeing your will ſtandeth not thereto: but till that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hour of commandement come, I will accompliſh your appointment, erecting here a Monaſtery of virgins for the ſervice of your God, and your words have made me thirſt with unquenchable deſire, till I be reſolved as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that faith. While ſhe returned him many thanks for his friendly offers, the old woman arrived who made him enamoured with the love of <hi>Francelina</hi> in his Realm: ſhe taking the Damoſel by the hand ſaid, Go with me fair daughter, and leave this moſt diſcourteous Knight, who ſuffered me to be miſuſed before him in <hi>Tharſus</hi>: whereof I hope to take ſufficient revenge, by the extream paſſions his heart ſhall endure hereafter.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had ſhe ended theſe words, but immediately they both vaniſhed away, wherewith the Prince great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admiring, was driven into ſuch a profound conceit of her rare beauty, as he thought even there to yéeld
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52643:35"/>
up his Ghoſt, becauſe he imagined never to have ſéen her like. Herein his judgement was no whit beguiled, for he did as many young Lovers do, ſhew themſelves fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Iudges in their own cauſes. Now enters he into conceit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the old woman had taken her away, that this Damoſel was <hi>Francelina,</hi> ſhe whom he had ſo lively imprinted in his heart, as for her love he had left his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country. Thus compaſſed with grief on every ſide, entred into theſe terms. Alas old Woman, I know not what thou maiſt be, yet very true do I find thy words: but ſmall to my avail did <hi>Ozalio</hi> ſmite thée in my preſence, that I muſt requite with ſo long, irkſome, and lingring pennance. Ah cruell enemy, why didſt thou rob mine eys ſo ſoon of their unſpeakable content? thou ſufferedſt me to ſée, that my love might grow the more immeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: but thy words were ſuch daggers to my heart, as never can I taſt a ſharper coroſive. And if this were the object of <hi>Francelina</hi> (for fairer creature did the Sun never ſhine upon) at no time ſhall my ſoul enjoy reſt, till once more I have ſéen her again. Thus entercourſing a thouſand opinions, he ſtood a long time as driven to the Antipodes, accuſing himſelf with baſe puſillanimity, and blaming the old woman who had ſo robbed him of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as he could not ſtay the Lady with him, by whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and gracious ſpéeches, he ſuppoſed himſelf in an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal beatitude.</p>
               <p>But now is the clowdy night chaſed toward the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, when he determined to effect what the damoſel had commanded him: and going to the Altar, he took the golden Baſons and the other ſumptuous things, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ready to be carried thence, deſpoiling likewiſe the Idol of the Crown, Scepter and Book. But as he would have lifted the Image forth of the chair, he found it ſo heavy as he was not able to ſtir it: wherewith he being offended, ſaid. And I ſhall do thée more honour then thou haſt yet received of me: ſo lifting up his Mace, he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52643:36"/>
made it fall in pieces to the ground. From out the body of the Image, flew a very ſtrange bird all black, giving ſuch fearfull ſhrikes and cries, as the Prince was thereat amazed: and following her out of the Temple, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a great many more ſuch like birds with her, they flying altogether with that noiſe, the ſame way where <hi>Ozalio</hi> and his Knights attended, whereat they likewiſe marvailing were certified by the men of the Iſland, that this prodigie ſignified <hi>Palmendos</hi> entrance into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for they had heard before, by ſundry learned Nigro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers, that theſe were certain infernal ſpirits which ſhould be chaſed forth of the Countrey, when the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Temple was finiſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rifarano, Ozalio,</hi> and all the Knights glad of this news, went where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the monſtrous wild Bore, and thence to the Temple, where <hi>Ozalio</hi> firſt found the Prince opening a great cheſt, which contained the Prieſts principal treaſure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſuch rare and ineſtimable Iewels, as (it was thought) the like was never ſéen before. <hi>Palmendos</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his friend <hi>Ozalio,</hi> ran and embraced him mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous kindly, the like did he to <hi>Rifarano, Lecefin,</hi> and the reſt, all of them extolling the happy ſtar that guided the Prince: and he acquainted them with all things ſince his departure from them, ſaving his conference with the Damoſel, becauſe none of them ſhould ſuſpect his love. Then intreated he <hi>Guillador</hi> to ſend for ſome skilful man who might undertake to deviſe and build the Monaſtery: in ſhort time the greater part of the Clergy was ſent for, and among them to a virtuous man of ſpecial knowledge, he gave the charge and ſuperintendance of the work, as alſo bountiful ſtore of Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Silver, which was taken out of the Prieſts wealthy Cheſt. All things he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the truſt of <hi>Guillador,</hi> that the Temple, Monaſtery, and ways thereto, ſhould be done in decent order: but he whoſe heart was onely dedicated to the Ladies beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which appeared unto him under form of a bodily il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52643:36"/>
took ſmall delight in any thing elſe, but in her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and divine remembrance. Now did he haſten the day of his departure, deſiring <hi>Rifarano</hi> and <hi>Lecefin</hi> to make ſpéed to the Emperour, and preſent the Gyanteſſe, her Daughter and the other priſoners to him, as alſo all the Treaſure was found in the Temple from a ſtrange Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman religiouſly vowed to his ſervice: who in reſpect of great affairs that called him elſewhere, could not come to kiſſe his Majeſties hand, which he will no with all ſpéed poſſible. <hi>Rifarano</hi> and <hi>Lecefin</hi> were loth to leave <hi>Palmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi> but ſéeing it muſt néeds be ſo, they ſoon after convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gyanteſſe and her Daughter on ſhipboard, they making great mone to be carried from the Iſland. In the ſame Ship was the Crown, Scepter, Image, Baſons, and all the other Treaſure carried, and in another ſhip the priſoners found in the Caſtle on the promontory, with all things elſe expedient for the voyage: then <hi>Rifarano</hi> and <hi>Lecefin</hi> taking their leave of <hi>Palmendos</hi> and <hi>Ozalio,</hi> went on board where the Gyanteſſe and the treaſure was, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding their anchors to be weighed, their ſails hoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the wind then ſerving fit and favourable, and ſo are they ſailing toward <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> As yet above <hi>Palmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> to ſée what <hi>Guilladors</hi> workmen would compaſſe, in ſo great a work as he had given them charge of.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T what time <hi>Rifarano</hi> and <hi>Lecefin</hi> ſhould arrive at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there were aſſembled many great Lords and Barons, in honour of a ſolemn feaſt, which the Emperour made for the marriage of the Hungarian Prince <hi>Ditreus</hi> ſon to King <hi>Fryſol,</hi> and twin brother to <hi>Belcar. Ditreus</hi> ſo ſoon as he was armed Knight, went to the Emperours Court where he was worthily welcommed, and albeit he was his Majeſties Nephew, yet he loved him with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affection, his courteous and civill manners, joined with his forwardneſſe in arms, gave hope that he would prove a valiant Knight hereafter. He had not béen long in the Emperours Court, and throughly acquainted with every one, but he grew enamoured with the beauty of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivela,</hi> daughter to the Soldan of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Alchidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> ſo that being one day in the Chamber of his couſin <hi>Philocriſta,</hi> eldeſt daughter to the Emperour, deviſing with her and her ſiſter <hi>Melicia</hi>: he got ſuch apt time and occaſion, as he made his intent known to <hi>Eſquivela,</hi> ſhe modeſtly anſwering, that if he faithfully meant to make her his wife, ſhe would ſettle her choice upon him onely. <hi>Ditreus</hi> who was thereon reſolved, deſired the Emperour and Empreſſe to grant that marriage: they being willing to gratifie their Nephew, as alſo to prefer the young
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52643:37"/>
Princeſſe: with the conſent of King <hi>Fryſol</hi> affianced them together, and <hi>Ditreus</hi> fearing the marriage would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred too long, ſolicited the Emperour in ſuch ſort, as he ſent with all ſpéed to make the ſame known to the Soldan. In mean while his Majeſty ſummoned the chiefeſt Lords of the Empire, to prepare a Triumph in honour of this feaſt, for the accompliſhment whereof nothing wanted, ſave onely the Embaſſadours return that went to the Soldan.</p>
               <p>But now are <hi>Rifarano</hi> and <hi>Lecefin</hi> entred the Haven of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> intending to land before the Emperour ſhould know any thing of them, becauſe they came not in ſuch equipage as happily he would expect. Being then all Armed, except with their Helmets, they rode through the City but with two Squires onely that brought their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Helmets, they being wonderfully noted of every one, and reputed for ſome ſtrange Lords of great birth, and in this ſort they came to the Pallace where very bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would have entred, but the guard ſtayed them, to underſtand the cauſe of their comming. We are, quoth they, two Knights of Countries far hence diſtant, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we come to ſée and ſerve the Emperour <hi>Palmerin.</hi> You muſt then leave theſe offenſive Arms, anſwered the Guard, if you mean to go where his Highneſſe is: or elſe declare your proper names to us, that we may go ſée if it be his pleaſure you ſhall come in this ſort before him. Our Arms we will not leave ſaid <hi>Rifarano,</hi> becauſe it ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéems an honeſt Knight ſo to do: but you may go certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Majeſty, that here is <hi>Lecefin</hi> ſon to the Soldan of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the Princeſſe <hi>Zephira,</hi> in whoſe company is <hi>Rifarano,</hi> Son to the Emperour <hi>Trineus</hi> of <hi>Almaign,</hi> who humbly deſire to kiſſe his Highneſſe hand. His Majeſty had no ſooner notice of their names<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but (in excéeding contentation) he ſent his ſon <hi>Primaleon</hi> with divers other Knights, to entertain them as beſéemed, and the Moor Princes ſéeing every one give place to him that came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52643:38"/>
immediately they reputed him to be the Emperours ſon, whereupon they alighted, when <hi>Primaleon</hi> courteouſly embracing them ſaid.</p>
               <p>My Lords, you are more then welcome to my fathers Court, his Majeſty being not a little glad of your arrival, ſo taking each of them by the hand, he conducted them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great Hall, where the Emperour ſate in his chair attending their comming, and then approaching the ſtate, made offer to kiſſe his Highneſſe hand, but he took them in his arms, and would not ſuffer them ſaying. Know my good couſins, that I account my ſelf greatly indebted to you, in that you would forſake your own Countries to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit me ſo far off, and that I may not fail in the uſe of your names, let me underſtand which of you is <hi>Rifarano,</hi> albeit you both ſtand equal in my grace and favour: yet being ſingularly deſirous to continue my love to the Princeſſe <hi>Zephira,</hi> I muſt conſequently eſteem and affect all that come from her. On the other ſide, as well for the indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble amity, intirely grounded in our young years betwéen the Emperour <hi>Trineus</hi> and me, as alſo in regard of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance united betwéen us: I am conſtrained to love his linage and poſterity, and thus I would have you both perſwaded, that greater good could not happen to me, then the ſight of them they eſtéem ſo dearly. Heaven ſo proſper and favour you in all things, as they have throughly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted my ſpirits, by the very hearing of my good friends and confederates the Soldan and <hi>Zephira,</hi> whoſe health I pray you reſolve me of, for it is long ſince I heard any thing from them.</p>
               <p>My Lord, anſwered <hi>Rifarano,</hi> at what time we departed <hi>Perſia,</hi> we left their perſons in moſt ſafe diſpoſition, and they by us (humbly kiſſing your Majeſties hand) have ſent this Letter in ſign of the reverence and love they bear you: now for they could not themſelves come ſo far, they have ſent this Prince their ſon named <hi>Lecefin,</hi> in their ſtead to do any ſerviceable duty in your royal Court· As

for my ſelf, I am <hi>Rifarano,</hi> ſon to <hi>Aurecinda,</hi> expreſly lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my Countrey to have knowledge of your excellency, and with my uttermoſt indeavours to follow your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: craving this licence, that I may go ſee the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Trineus</hi> my father, whoſe ſon I account my ſelf not onely happy to be, but greatly accuſe my ſelf of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that I have ſo long time deferred this voyage. <hi>Lece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin</hi> kiſſing the Letter, upon his knée delivered it to the Emperour, which he commanding to be opened, took and read as followeth.</p>

               <p>For this gentle Letter from the Soldan and <hi>Zephira,</hi> the Emperour gave <hi>Lecefin</hi> their Son many thanks, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again welcomming him to the Court, then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to <hi>Rifarano,</hi> he ſaid. I well perceive my Lord <hi>Rifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano,</hi> that you are the undoubted Son of the Emperour <hi>Trineus,</hi> becauſe you ſo lively reſemble him in face, well have you done to come ſee ſo good a father, and the more do I thank God for your arrival here, at this time when we intend to hold open Court, to honour the approaching marriage of our beloved couſin: and ſo pleaſe ye to ſtay the intended Triumphs, here ſhall you ſee good ſtore of worthy Knights that mean to tempt Fortune for the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of honour.</p>
               <p>This news dread Lord, anſwered <hi>Rifarano,</hi> are not a little welcome to us, in reſpect that next the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal point of our voiage, which was to kiſſe your Majeſties hand: we were deſirous to behold the valour of your Knights, for their renown is ſpread through the whole world, and now we ſhall well witneſſe the ſame, comming at a time ſo apt for the purpoſe. Nor can we forget a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Knight whom we met in our journey, being named <hi>Palmendos,</hi> without his ſecond or match in martiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and I think there is no one man living, except your Highneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the mirrour and Paragon of chivalry, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52643:39"/>
worthily may be equalled with him: Right ſorry are we, becauſe we can deliver no better knowledge of the man, by reaſon of his deſire to paſſe unknown, and therefore concealeth himſelf in all places where he travelleth. This famous man (right noble Lord) humbly kiſſeth your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hand, having ſent you ſuch rare and ineſtimable rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as when you have ſéen them, you will judge that the like preſent was never given to any King or Emperor as we are to preſent your Majeſty withal from this unknown Knight. The charge of this meſſage we undertook in that our ſelves with divers other Knights were delivered from the cruel bondage of <hi>Baledon,</hi> the Giant in the Iſle of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,</hi> where we endured miſeries, not fit to be recounted in this gracious aſſembly. Yet the heavens gave <hi>Palmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> power to kill this Tyrant: After which victory, he hath ſeized the Iſland ſubject to your Majeſty, until you ſend ſome ſuch Governour or Lieutenant as beſt liketh you: wherewithal, as teſtimony of his honourable victory, he hath ſent you the wife and daughter to the Giant to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them as ſhall ſéem beſt in your wisdom. Hereto he added the whole diſcourſe of the Temple, and how <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendos</hi> had ended the enchanted adventure thereof. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt (quoth the Emperour, being driven into great admiration) I cannot imagine who this worthy Knight ſhould be for if he have ended ſuch a weighty enterprize, it muſt néeds follow that he is peerleſſe in Chivalry; and if it be his fortune to ſée our Court, I ſhall requite him with all the honour I can: but tell me, is he a Moor, or a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian?</p>
               <p>A Moor born as I think (anſwered <hi>Rifarano</hi>) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he well underſtandeth this language; and ſuch is his brave conſtitution of body, as I think a more gallant Gentleman was never ſéen. But may it pleaſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to ſend for the wife of <hi>Baledon,</hi> and her daughter, as alſo the rich preſent abiding in your port? The Emperor requiting them with many thanks, ſent for the priſoners
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52643:40"/>
be brought on land, commanding the two Princes to be unarmed, and ſent them two coſtly Turkiſh Robes, which his ſon <hi>Primaleon</hi> and <hi>Ditreus</hi> ſaw effectually executed, with all things elſe neceſſay for men of ſuch calling: In mean while he ſent for the Empreſſe and his daughters to behold the rare and precious treaſure ſent by <hi>Palmendos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Empreſſe and her daughters were come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hall, they entertained the ſtrange Knights excéed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courteouſly, but <hi>Lecefin</hi> regarding the beauty of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſta,</hi> grew into ſuch conceit of her ſingular feature, as ſhe ſtood in his thoughts beyond all compare. She with her ſiſters <hi>Flerida, Bazilia</hi> and <hi>Melicia,</hi> (for ſo were the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors daughters named, gave them a maidens welcome to the Court, ſuch as beſéemed them towards Knight errant, as alſo becauſe they were Princes of ſo honourable birth. After that, the Gianteſſe, her daughter, and the reſt of the priſoners through a mighty throng of people, were brought to the Pallace, one of the Knights in behalf of all the reſt, knéeling before the Emperour, thus ſpake.</p>

                  </gap>lower of Knights, named <hi>Palmendos,</hi> who delivered us from cruel <hi>Baledon</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> hath ſent us (with this ineſtimable treaſure) unto your Majeſty, as to the onely Lord and Prince of the world, of whom he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt humble and religious opinion, that you ſhould take compaſſion on our miſeries, and grant us acceſſe to our own houſes. Good friends, ſaid the Emperour, your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt report of this Knight, to whom I am ſo much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, doth make me more earneſtly long to ſée him in our Court: whither you all (for his ſake) are ſo heartily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as ye ſhall well perceive the ſame before ye depart: afterward (in Gods name) go when you pleaſe. And theſe were not words alone, but deeds did confirm the ſame, the Emperour rewarding each one of them with ſuch liberal gifts, as they eſteemed his largeſſe and munificence equal with that of <hi>Xerxes, Julius Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> the great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward

he ſent for the Gianteſſe and her daughter, and to them offered very honourable kindneſſe: but their hearts were ſo ſwollen and confounded with grief, as they would make no anſwer at all; whereupon he appointed them a convenient place in the City, with proviſion of all things for their neceſſary uſes: but the Gianteſſe falling into an extream lunacy, died ſoon after thereof; yet her daughter became a Chriſtian, and lived long time in the Emperors favour.</p>
               <p>Now are all the ſumptuous utenſils brought before his Majeſty, the Idols Chair, his Crown the Scepter, Book, and the reſt, which being well and adviſedly regarded, were judged the like never to be ſeen before: whereupon his Majeſty took the Book labouring with all his ſtrength and cunning to open the ſame, and after delivered it to his Barons to try what they could do, but all their labour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, he ſaid. I think this Book can be opened by none other then him onely that conquered it; let it therefore be carefully kept till his comming: Now call I to mind the Damoſels words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that departed ſo ſuddenly without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and verely I am perſwaded, this Knight is the man ſhe ſpake of, who hath ſent us this treaſure from the Iſle of <hi>Delphos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With theſe ſpeeches of the Emperour, divers of his Knights grew ſomewhat offended, to hear ſuch commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations paſſe on him who was unknown; wherefore they intended if ever he came thither, to make ſuch proof of his valour and proweſſe, as the Emperour ſhould perceive he ſpake but by affection. Not long after his Majeſty ſent one of his chief Knights to <hi>Delphos,</hi> and with him ſuch a train as beſeemed the expedition, there to ſee all things ordered to his highneſſe uſe, and to prevent inſurrections, if any were like to grow; giving the Knight charge, if he found <hi>Palmendos</hi> there, to requeſt him with all ſpeed to viſite the Emperour. But the Knight came ſhort of his intent, for he had ſet ſail towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> according as you

ſhall hear hereafter: Notwithſtanding the Knight was very graciouſly welcomed thither, and the poſſeſſion of the whole Iſland ſurrendred to him, which in the end was transferred to one of <hi>Palmendos</hi> ſons, being a pleaſant, fair and opulent Countrey, navigable for all paſſengers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>

This young Prince was named <hi>Abenunco,</hi> a gentle youth, and very well given, who earneſtly intreated his mother, to obtain ſo much of the Soldan his father, that after his ſiſters marriage, he might ſtay a while at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which ſute at her requeſt the Soldan granted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent him by ſea well accompanied with Knights. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benunco</hi> ſailing along the coaſt of <hi>Thrace,</hi> met with <hi>Ocuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> King of <hi>Culaquin,</hi> who was ſon in law to the great Turk, and reputed the hardieſt Knight among al the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Nobility: his Majeſty having given his daughter in marriage to this Barbarian, ſhe being one of the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed Ladies in all Heatheneſſe. <hi>Ocurites</hi> knowing the inveterate malice betwéen the Emperour and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law, (the more to pleaſe him) provided himſelf of good ſtrength by ſea, and daily came upon the coaſts of <hi>Greece,</hi> ſending vauntcurriers with ſtrong Brigandines before him, to diſcover what Chriſtians ſtirred abroad, and ſundry times took many of them captives, as now
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52643:42"/>
he intended to do by the Soldans ſon. When <hi>Ocurites</hi> by the ſtreamers and banderolls heard of the Babylonian Prince, and knew (withall) that his father was a chief friend to the Emperour: in great fury with his ſhips he ſet upon him, <hi>Abenunco</hi> with his Knights defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo well as they could. During this conflict <hi>Palmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> approached very near them, and of a Galley filled with Chriſtian ſlaves, he demanded the cauſe of this fierce incounter.</p>
               <p>Sir, anſwered one of the ſlaves, he to whom this great train of ſhipping appertaineth, is <hi>Ocurites</hi> King of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laquin,</hi> and ſon to the great Turk, that with divers of his league and faction daily coaſts on Greece, to endamage the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> enemy to his Father, and thoſe he hath now met withall, belong to the Soldan of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> they ſailing (as we underſtand) toward <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> When the Prince heard what the Chriſtian had ſaid, he bravely incouraged his couſin <hi>Ozalio,</hi> in aſſiſting the well-willers to the noble Emperour: ſo coming to the Kings ſhip he thus ſpake.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhalt thou <hi>Ocurites</hi> offend ſo good a Prince, as is the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> herewith he began to lay about him valiantly and <hi>Ozalio</hi> not one inch behind him, made the enemy well underſtand his invincible courage. <hi>Palmendos</hi> knowing the King by his rich Armour, gave him ſuch a puiſſant ſtroke with the hills of his Sword on the Helmet, as made him ſtagger, and at length fall down, when offering to riſe again, <hi>Palmendos</hi> caught him ſo ſtrongly by the helmet, as he puld it violently from off his head, keeping him ſtill under his ſword in ſuch ſubjection, as at length he was carried priſoner into the Princes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, and there committed him to the charge of four truſty Knights. In mean while <hi>Ozalio</hi> fought with the Kings brother, who underſtanding that <hi>Ocurites</hi> was taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, did what he could to recover him again: but <hi>Ozalio</hi> ſtept between him and his purpoſe, ſtill labouring him
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52643:42"/>
with ſo many hardy ſtrokes, as at length he ſmote his head from his ſhoulders. The reſt beholding their King taken, and his brother ſlain, beſide the great maſſacre made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, &amp; that they were not able to withſtand their fortune: a number fell headlong into the ſea, rather then they would die under the enemies ſword. <hi>Palmendos</hi> ſeeing no further reſiſtance but that the Turks were utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cauſed ſuch priſoners as were taken to be made ſure, the ſhips likewiſe to be ſeized on as his own: then coming to <hi>Ozalio,</hi> whoſe forwardneſs he commended, he willed him to ſee all things diſpoſed as beſeemed ſuch a victory; afterward he imbraced the Soldans ſon, and divers courteous ceremonies paſſing between them, the one for his happy deliverance, the other reported what he had done was for the Emperours ſake, at length <hi>Palmendos</hi> uſed theſe ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>My Lord, willingly would I bear you company to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> but that a voyage of great importance doth ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently call me to another place, yet ſeeing you are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Tyrant <hi>Ocurites,</hi> and all your Knights in ſufficient ſafety, let me obtain this favour at your hands, to take the King with you to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and all the Chriſtian priſoners delivered from captivity. Them ſhall you preſent on my behalf to the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting that this ancient Chriſtian enemy may be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept, untill I come to ſee his Majeſty, which ſhall be with all the expedition I can. Worthy Sir anſwered <hi>Abenunco,</hi> it grieves me that your journy lies not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> becauſe I ſhould think my ſelf happy in having your company, being the man to whom I am continually bound for my life and liberty: and hereof I am aſſured, that over and above your gracious welcome, you ſhall win the honour of the famous triumph, ordained by the Emperour at the marriage of my ſiſter with the Prince of <hi>Hungaria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And heartily ſorry I am, anſwered <hi>Palmendos,</hi> that I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52643:43"/>
cannot be preſent in ſo worthy an aſſembly: whereof at this time you may well excuſe me, not doubting but I ſhall come with ſome ſufficient amends for my ſtay. Theſe ſpéeches he uttered, his thoughts being far otherwiſe, for ſo ſoon as he heard of the Iouſts at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to go thither ſecretly without making himſelf known to any, but as a ſtrange Knight to adventure his fortune among other: wherefore he departed from <hi>Abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunco</hi> who offered him many rich preſents for his great kindneſſe, yet would not he accept of any. <hi>Abenunco</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him many thanks chiefly for his promiſe, that he would in ſhort time viſite the Emperour in perſon: ſo after many courteous ſpéeches, and ſundry familiar farewels, <hi>Palmendos</hi> commanded his Pilot to lanch into the high Seas, for that he intended another kind of courſe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reatly did <hi>Abenunco</hi> commend his fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in finding ſo good ſuccour at a time of ſuch neceſſity, and all the Knights in his company held opinion, that <hi>Palmendos</hi> was the onely flower of Chivalry: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other the Chriſtian ſlaves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting their deliverance for a miracle, imagined the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof was ſome great friend to the Emperour.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52643:43"/>
In this joy they ſailed till they came to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where his Majeſty being advertiſed that the Soldans ſon was arrived, commanded <hi>Primaleon, Ditreus,</hi> and many of his beſt Barons to go and conduct him to the Court. In the mean while <hi>Abenunco</hi> cloathing himſelf moſt ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, cauſed the King <hi>Ocurites</hi> and the Chriſtian priſoners to be carried on ſhore, that he might not fail in the charge given him by <hi>Palmendos</hi>: So the Babylonian Prince ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Court, with all the priſoners going orderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him he gave charge to one of his chiefeſt Knights, that he ſhould preſent them to his Majeſty; and being come into the Emperours preſence, the Knight delivered theſe ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>High and mighty Monarch of the world, behold here the King of <hi>Culaquin,</hi> ſon to the great Turk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who keeping the ſeas with a great power to endamage your Empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Maſter the Prince <hi>Abenunco</hi> and we fell into his danger: from which a worthy Knight, named <hi>Palmendos,</hi> by deeds of rare and haughty Chivalry delivered us in a time moſt needfull, and therefore hath ſent both us and him to your excellency, deſiring that <hi>Ocurites</hi> ſhould be ſafely kept till he come himſelf. Theſe ſundry good turns received from a Knight unknown, drove the Emperour into a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full admiration; and becauſe he could not imagine whence they ſhould proceed, therefore he was the more deſirous to behold the Knight: whereupon he committed the King to a ſtrong Tower, commanding he ſhould have all things neceſſary for his health, and a Page to attend on him leſt he ſhould offend himſelf.</p>
               <p>But now is <hi>Abenunco</hi> by <hi>Primaleon</hi> and the other Princes brought to the Emperor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who embracing him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honourably in his arms, gave him ſuch entertainment as beſeemed his eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becauſe he was not yet knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he willed that he ſhould be bedfellow to his ſon <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,</hi> which united a faithfull League of Amity between them, hoping one day to travel as companions in Arms
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52643:44"/>
together. <hi>Abenunco</hi> having likewiſe told the Emperour of his good ſucceſſe and wonderfull deliverance by the means of <hi>Palmendos,</hi> gave no little contentment to <hi>Rifarano</hi> and <hi>Lecefin,</hi> who imagined themſelves as much beholding to the Prince as any. Afterward he was conducted to the Empreſſe chamber, where ſhe and her Ladies graciouſly welcomed him, but eſpecially the Princeſſe <hi>Eſquivela</hi> his ſiſter, becauſe he came to confirm what ſhe moſt deſired. My Lord and brother (quoth ſhe) nothing could happen to my greater contentment, then to have your preſence in the honour prepared for me; whereto ſéeing our gracious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents could not come, they have for my ſake ſent you in their place: and doubt not but your entertainment ſhall be ſuch as ſhall agrée with their expectation and your own worthineſſe. Fair ſiſter (anſwered <hi>Abenunco</hi>) the Soldan our father hearing of the honour the Emperour intended, by giving you in marriage to the Prince <hi>Ditreus</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, hath ſent me to thank the Emperour on his behalf, offering for this: contract to articulate with his Majeſty, in all ſuch things as with honour he ſhall demand. As for our gracious mother, <hi>Alchidiana,</hi> ſhe hath ſent you by me jewels and treaſure beſéeming your degrée, that on your marriage day you may witneſs the royal race from whence you are deſcended; not doubting but before you depart this court, to make the magnificence of the Babylonian Prince ſo famous, as the moſt opulent Lord of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſhall not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare therewith.</p>
               <p>Divers other ſpéeches paſſed betwéen the brother and the ſiſter, till the coffers of treaſure were brought and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Princeſſe; which when <hi>Ditreus</hi> behold, he judged them to excéed the limits of all frugality, &amp; might full well beſéem the greateſt ſtate in Chriſtendome. Now did the Emperor cauſe the Tourney to be openly proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the fifth day following the marriage was ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, great ſtore of worthy Knights reſorting day by day to the Court, that all the field appointed for Triumphs
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52643:44"/>
was covered over with Tents. Among other came thither <hi>Lynedes,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Lique,</hi> he that hazarded himſelf ſo far in the adventure of <hi>Francelina,</hi> being (in ſooth) reputed one of the moſt valiant men at Arms in all <hi>Greece</hi>; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of this marriage drew him from his Caſtle, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied onely with the County of <hi>Pelada,</hi> his couſin who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he was younger then <hi>Lynedes,</hi> yet was he thought lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inferiour to him in Chivalry. This County had eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Lady of great parentage and loved her with ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular affection, as he brought her in company to ſée the Iuſts at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being there arrived, they would not enter the City, but ſet up their Tent far diſtant from all the reſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſent a Squire to the Court, to publiſh that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would hazard himſelf in the Tourney, ſhould find two Knights there ready in the field, that would Iuſt with any one that durſt enter the Liſts; ſuch therefore as were minded to make proof of their valour, might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained for thrée or four courſes. Theſe ſpéeches being heard by the Duke of <hi>Pera,</hi> he ſtept to the Squire, and thus anſwered.</p>
               <p>You may (my friend) return to your Maſters, and ſay, that ſuch as are minded to Iuſt, will not ſtay long before they enter the field. Then turning to the Knights of the Court, he procéeded in this manner. Doubtleſſe theſe Knights are valiant and hardy, that are loth to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſlothfull in any vertuous exerciſe. With this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Squire returned back to the Tent, and the two Couſins being ſatisfied therewith, prepared ſtrong Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at the entrance of their Pavilion, for all ſuch as ſhould come to Iuſt againſt them: But the County intreated <hi>Lynedes</hi> to ſuffer him to make the firſt tryal of his fortune, which he did in regard of his love to his Lady, who had cauſed the Tent to be ſo commodiouſly placed, as ſhe might at pleaſure behold al the paſtimes, docking herſelf in moſt gorgeous attyre, and bravely attended on by her waiting
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52643:45"/>
woman to out countenance ſuch as came againſt her Lord and husband.</p>
               <p>The Emperor underſtanding what meſſage the Squire had brought, imagined that theſe two Knights were <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendos</hi> and his Couſin <hi>Ozalio</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when one thing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually beateth on a mans conceit, he imagineth every thing conformable to the ſame. Wherefore he told his opinion to the Prince <hi>Rifarano,</hi> who could not think them to be the Lords of <hi>Tharſus,</hi> yet to ſatisfie the Emperours mind, he mounted on horſeback, and being accompanied with other Knights of the Court, rode to the Tent, where the two Couſins remained. Saluting the Squires, he entred, finding <hi>Lynedes</hi> unarmed, but his Couſin was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided at all points except his helmet: whereupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded if they were the Knights that ſent the challenge to the Court? To whom the Lord of <hi>Lique</hi> anſwered, that they were. Then <hi>Rifarano</hi> procéeded thus. Gentlemen, ye have attempted a thing (in my opinion) but little for your eaſe: but I think you did it to this end, that you might méet with ſome one to abate your pride and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>When that commeth to paſſe (anſwered <hi>Lynedes</hi>) we ſhall but accompany many others, who unable to effect their haughty enterprizes, have remained fruſtrate in their deſigns: in vain therefore ſhall you take any further care for our affairs; but if you will go arm your ſelf, return and prove what this Knight can do, who is more deſirous to ſight with his ſword then with his tongue; otherwiſe you offer injury to the order, which every noble mind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth as his proper life. <hi>Rifarano</hi> ſomewhat moved with theſe words, took his leave, and returned to the Emperor, aſſuring him that theſe Knights were not <hi>Palmendos</hi> and <hi>Ozalio,</hi> notwithſtanding they ſéemed good and hardy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions deſcended of ſome great birth, in that they were ſo worthily accompanied, with women of choiſe and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar beauty, as alſo Gentlemen of civil behaviour. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52643:45"/>
many Knights jouſted with the County, who ſtill bare away the honour of the field, <hi>Lynedes</hi> all this while not arming himſelf, for the worthy ſucceſſe of his couſin deſervred high comendation, whereof his Lady was not a little proud, to ſée her husband perform ſuch chivalry. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farano</hi> and <hi>Lecefin</hi> envying the Counties glory, intended to ſée how they ſhould ſpéed in the jouſt, yet they deſired to defer it till the laſt day, when they vanquiſhing the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and <hi>Lynedes</hi> his couſin, might bear away the whole praiſe of the Triumph: but others came in the mean time and altered their intent, as you at large ſhall perceive hereafter.</p>

               <p>For this cauſe, when the time likewiſe ſhould conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently agree therewith, he commanded his ſon to remember
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52643:46"/>
the Emperour of his promiſe; which Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his dying father to perform, with exceeding ſorrow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed his funerals, and making choice afterward for his own fancy, in hope to fulfill his fathers deſire in his iſſue, he married with the daughter to the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> by whom he had three ſons, and two daughters that were born at a birth. His eldeſt ſon was named <hi>Arnedes,</hi> whoſe mind was evermore given to arms and military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, wherein time and uſe made him ſo expert, as he was eſteemed the onely champion of <hi>France</hi>: it came ſo to paſſe, as the King of <hi>France</hi> married one of his daughters with the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> at whoſe marriage <hi>Arnedes</hi> won ſuch fame by his chivalry, as the report of him was blazed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row many provinces.

               <p>King <hi>Lewis</hi> ſeeing his ſon <hi>Arnedes</hi> of years to have a wife, and fearing he ſhould elſewhere diſpoſe his liking, one day called him into his chamber, and thus conferred with him. My ſon ſuch is the natural inclination of my love towards thee, as I would not wiſh any thing to thee, but to have thee as well contented therewith as my ſelf: to this end I uſe theſe ſpeeches, for that our late Kingly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of famous memory, at the very ſhutting up of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt days, gave me charge to join thee in marriage with the Emperors daughter of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that ſuch iſſue (as no doubt) ſhall proceed from you both may ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble their famous Anceſtors. Wherefore I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, right ſoon to ſend an Embaſſage to him to ſolicite this marriage, which I hope he will like well of, and this I can aſſure thee, if fame tell no leaſings that the Princeſs <hi>Philocriſta</hi> now aged ſixteen years, is a Lady of ſuch rare
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52643:46"/>
and ſingular beauty, as nature hath not framed her like under the moving of theſe eight Spheres.</p>
               <p>When the Prince <hi>Arnedes</hi> ſaw that his father talked ſo courteouſly with him about theſe affairs, he humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him not to travel any further in the matter, for there was time enough hereafter to deal in ſuch occaſions: wherewith the King pacified him, becauſe he ſaw his ſon ſo cold (as he thought) in matter of marriage, nor would he trouble him any more therewith afterward. But the young Prince wiſe and adviſed in concealing his own deſires, having long before heard fair <hi>Philocriſta</hi> commended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond compare, as alſo the déeds of the Knights in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Palmerins</hi> Court, he had no leiſure now to forbid them his remembrance, ſo that fain would he compaſſe a ſecret journey to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> intending if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe pleaſed to demand her of the Emperour in marriage, and if his Majeſty would not conſent thereto, he intended to do ſuch exploits in <hi>Greece,</hi> as the honourable praiſe of them ſhould compaſſe his love. This was the project of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes</hi> reſolution, which in ſecret he imparted to his couſin <hi>Recinde,</hi> who with mighty perſwaſions animated him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: vowing that till death they would loyally continue friendly companions, and ſo well govern themſelves by diſguiſing their perſons, and contrarying their languages in theſe affairs, as the moſt skilfull head ſhould not ſearch the depth of their intent. When the two couſins were thus determined, <hi>Arnedes</hi> imagining it no wiſedom to juggle with his father, went and requeſted a favour at his Highneſſe hand the effect whereof was thus.</p>
               <p>Gracious Lord and Father, quoth he, my deſire is (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your diſpleaſure) that I may go ſée the Princeſs <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locriſta,</hi> as well to like as love before any motion of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: and becauſe my couſin <hi>Recinde</hi> will bear me compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I would have your Majeſty ſo perſwaded, that in ſecret diſguiſing we will paſſe unknown of any, much leſſe give occaſion of ſuſpect what we are, not doubting but by our
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52643:47"/>
vertuous behaviour, to yéeld you content by our voyage, and our ſelves good report. Beſide, the world is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith that this Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had not won ſuch fame and renown, but onely by the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merables Trophies, erected in divers regions of his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full travels, which are examples ſufficient for Knights of high deſire, not to deſiſt from worthy enterprizes for the object of death, who without regard of time or place, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth in ambuſh the ſteps of the worthieſt. Nor let doubt of our ſtay in <hi>Greece</hi> hinder us, good father; for as we go not to build any dwelling there, ſo is the hope of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to be expected more ſpéedy. It greatly diſpleaſeth me, anſwered the King, that I have promiſed to mine own diſcontentment, and which much more will redownd to your diſadvantage; but ſéeing I have paſt my word, and in this ſort you mean perſonally to viſit <hi>Greece,</hi> go in Gods name, who guide and ſend you ſafely home again, elſe will your ſtay more hurt me then can you imagine.</p>
               <p>Humbly taking his leave of the King, becauſe he would not have his departure known, he ſecretly got him to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> accompanied with none but his couſin <hi>Recinde,</hi> his dwarf and thrée other, where finding a ſhip ready they hoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſail and away, landing at the firſt port they came to in <hi>Greece,</hi> and commanding the ſhip to ſtay for them at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>

had adviſedly marked their Arms, when immediately he judged them to be Frenchmen) gave the ſpurs to his horſe and ran againſt the County, each of them breaking their ſtaves gallantly without any further danger. At the ſecond courſe the County was unhorſed by <hi>Arnedes,</hi> whereat the Emperour and his Lords very much rejoiced, highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the behaviour of the French Knight. Needs muſt we think, that <hi>Lynedes</hi> was offended ſeeing his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin thrown ſo furiouſly to the ground, wherefore arming himſelf ſpeedily and mounting on horſeback, with a very ſtrong Lance he angerly encountered <hi>Arnedes,</hi> who gave his enemy as good as he brought. <hi>Lynedes</hi> was very cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick that he had ſped no better, whereupon at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond race, <hi>Arnedes</hi> met him ſo full in the carrier, as he caſt him out of his ſaddle over the crupper of his horſe: he thinking to recover himself, and loth to forſake the rains of his bridle, cauſed his horſe to fall backwards upon him, that he was the worſe for this long time after. But <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes</hi> he remained freſh and frolick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as though he had yet done nothing at all, wherefore he came to his companion, ſaying.</p>
               <p>Now let us go kiſſe my Lord the Emperours hand, ſeeing there is no more to be done here: and ſo in the troop they withdrew themſelves, early one marvelling at this Frenchmans valour, becauſe they knew <hi>Lynedes</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one of the hardieſt Knights in <hi>Greece.</hi> When the Emperour ſaw them comming toward him, he advanced himſelf to entertain them, and imbracing them graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his arms, ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Right welcome are you Gentlemen into this Country, where you have exceedingly contented me by your fortunate ſucceſſe: let me therefore know of whence and what you are, that I may love and eſteem you accordingly.</p>
               <p>It is the wonted grace and vertue of your Majeſty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Arnedes,</hi> that makes you evermore regard poor travelling Knights, although their deſerts be nothing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent;

I thank you (anſwered the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) for the pain you have endured in this journey, which amply declares the generoſity of your brave minds; becauſe ſuch principles cannot procéed but from a haughty and reſolute courage. With theſe words (for this day) he returned to the Pallace, commanding <hi>Arnedes</hi> to go on his right hand, and <hi>Recinde</hi> on his left, they both marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſée the goodly train of Knights that attended on the Emperour.</p>
               <p>All the way his Majeſty eyed <hi>Arnedes</hi> very much, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining he ſaw the lively countenance of <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and therefore deſired to know his name and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, telling him whom he reſembled in many points. In truth, my Lord, anſwered the French Prince, it doth not beſéem me to dally with your Majeſty: I am King <hi>Lewis</hi> his eldeſt ſon, therefore I am the more like to him. And for his ſake, ſaid the Emperor, muſt I needs love you the more, becauſe heretofore I received by him and his brother great honour. Yet becauſe he perceived that <hi>Arne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> was unwilling to be known, he cut off theſe ſpéeches; &amp; being come to the Pallace, after the Princes were both unarmed, he welcomed them as beſéemed their eſtates.</p>

though not with dainty and delicate viands, yet with indifferent good chear, and kind humanity, which eſpecially proceeded from the Knights wife and her fair daughter, who diligently noted the behaviour of theſe Knights. Such was the countenance of the young Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, as by the continual office of her eys, her heart began to be ſomewhat touched, and fain would ſhe participate of the pleaſure her mind conceived; whereto <hi>Palmendos</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was ſomewhat provoked, ſéeing his eys over-buſied with bathing in the flood of delight, which the preſence of this Damoſel onely procured.</p>
               <p>All ſupper time theſe queint glances endured, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other talk they had together, the old Knight deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his gueſts if they travelled to the Tourney at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>; for yeſterday (quoth he) came I thence, not a little marvelling to ſée the number of Knights come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all Countreys.

                  <hi>Palmendos</hi> hearing the name of <hi>Francelina,</hi> was aſſailed with ſuch a ſudden and vehement paſſion, procéeding from the unquenchable flame, wherein his heart lay burning for her love as his countenance altered, and his very ſoul was touched with the word <hi>Francelina.</hi> Wherefore moſt inſtantly he deſired the Knight his Hoſt, to tell him of what race the Lady was diſcended, and (withall) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed in diſcourſe of the adventure, which ſo many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Knights had loſt their labours about: likewiſe to tell him, in what Country the Caſtle was, where the Fairies had appointed this enchantment, becauſe he had ſundry times heard ſpéeches thereof, yet could not méet with any one to reſolve him of the truth.</p>
               <p>Know then good Sir, anſwered the old Knight, that this Lady is one of the faireſt and moſt gracious Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that this earthly habitation enjoies, between the two Tropiques of Heaven, Daughter to the King of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly,</hi> now priſoner to the great Turk, ſhe being taken forth of her Cradle, and incloſed in the Caſtle of <hi>Carderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a,</hi> by the thrée inchanting Siſters of the Iſland, becauſe they foreſaw by their Magicall Art, that her Father (who was their noble Friend) never could be delivered from the captivity of the Infidels, but by the means of ſome perfect accompliſhed Knight. Thus did they direct this enchantment, that the readineſſe of <hi>Francelinaes</hi> beauty, might be blazed by them through all Regions, and deſire to gain the Kingdome of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> (for he that ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Lady muſt enjoy her as his Wife, next heir after the death of the captive King) might incourage Knights to come prove this adventure: whither many have gone in hope of happy conqueſt, as the aforenamed Prince <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> did, but he wants ſtrength as ſundry other have done, yet will he make the acceſſe to the Fortreſſe more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, untill he for whom the Princeſſe is deſtinied, arrive there with ſuch puiſſance and magnanimity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him to forſake the place.

And then <hi>Palmendos</hi> ſeeing his friend well weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed comes bravely prancing into the field, ſo diſguiſed, that <hi>Abenunco</hi> and <hi>Rifarano</hi> could not know him. A while he ſtood regarding the Emperour his father, ſo honourably placed with his noble Lords and Barons on the ſcaffolds: Then viewing the Empreſſe with her gracious train of Ladies, he wondred at ſuch pomp and magnificence, thus ſpeaking to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Soveraign Creator and director of all things, how am I bound in duty to thy Majeſty, having made me the ſon of ſuch a father, as not onely is reputed, the beſt Knight under heaven, but is alſo the mightieſt Prince on the face of the earth. Seeing then thou haſt beſtowed on me ſuch grace and favour, as that I ſhould iſſue from ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſonage, I muſt endeavour my ſelf to reſemble him, and by ſomething declare that I am his ſon: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though now I go againſt the Knights of his Court, I
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52643:53"/>
hope he ſhall have ſmall cauſe to miſlike of me, when he knows my forwardneſs in other matters on his Majeſties behalf.</p>
               <p>Then beholding a Knight ready to encounter him, he brake off his muſings, and gave him ſuch a welcome, as he tumbled headlong down to the ground. Like ſucceſſe had divers other Knights of the Court, which <hi>Arnedes</hi> ſeeking angerly to revenge, accompanied the other in misfortune, and after him <hi>Pernedin</hi> ſon to the Duke of <hi>Pera,</hi> one of the beſt eſteemed knights in <hi>Greece. Rifarano</hi> next ran againſt <hi>Palmendos,</hi> and three courſes they paſt bravely with the break of the lance, but at the fourth <hi>Rifarano</hi> was diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; wherevpon <hi>Recinde</hi> came to revenge his couſin <hi>Arne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> foil, whoſe fortune was as bad as any of the other, and <hi>Lecefin</hi> had his diſgrace likewiſe for company.</p>
               <p>The Emperour moved to admire this Chivalry, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant who this gallant ſhould be, affirmed that he never ſaw his equal in proweſſe; the like did <hi>Primaleon,</hi> being very deſirous to know his name.

So went <hi>Palmendos</hi> cloſely to his lodging again, where being unarmed, he found that he had received three wounds that day in the Iuſt, the greateſt whereof he took by <hi>Recinde</hi> the Prince of <hi>Spain</hi>: but when he ſaw <hi>Ozalio</hi> in good diſpoſition, he was right joyfull, commending him for his worthy behaviour.

               <p>Madame (quoth he) the rare ornaments wherewith na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath accompanied your divine perfection, cauſeth you to ſpeak ſo favourably on my behalf, although no deſert in me can apprehend the leaſt part of this kindneſs: but were I poſſeſſed with any ſuch ability, the very glance of her eye, who hath power to command me, would increaſe my ſtrength, and make me invincible, wherfore my deſires

               <p>
                  <hi>Recinde</hi> (on the other ſide) had ſo communed with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi> that ſhe perceiving how many offers he made to be her Knight, favorably gave him entertainment: and more then any thing elſe it pleaſed him to note her beauty, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and good grace, which ſet his eys, and all his ſences to work.

               </p>
               <p>But now is the hour of reſt come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the Emperor withdrew himſelf to his chamber, and all the Knights likewiſe to their lodgings, where <hi>Arnedes</hi> ſtill meditating on the words of his beloved, immediatly wrote to the King his father, that he ſhould ſend Embaſſadors to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, for concluſion of the marriage; and till they came he would there ſtay at the Court, without any further ſpéech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the matter till their arrival: ſo ſealing his pacquet as it ſhould be delivered to his fathers hand, he ſent one of his Squires the next morning away therewith in poſt; who made no leſs ſpeed then the Prince had commanded him. Afterward he called <hi>Bruquel</hi> his Dwarf aſide, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him not to ſtir out of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> becauſe he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52643:55"/>
was to be part about ſome matters of importance, and if the Emperour in the mean while asked for him, to make him that anſwer; or any other that enquired after him. Moreover, that he ſhould from time to time confer with the Princeſs <hi>Philocriſta,</hi> aſſuring her of his zealous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her ſervice; which that he might the better execute, he was ridden abroad to take the air of the fields. The Dwarf very willingly performed every thing he had in charge, not daring to break the leaſt article he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>The time being come of the Tourney, rare Chivalry was there delivered on all ſides; but <hi>Arnedes, Recinde</hi> and <hi>Rifarano</hi> had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefeſt honor, attending when the ſtrange Knight ſhould ſhew himſelf again: And when they ſaw he came not, they immediately determined the execution of their enterpriſe, without returning into the City, or knowing which way each other rode, but even took their chance as fortune directed them. The Emperour was glad that his Knights had won the day, yet could he not but marvel that the ſtranger was ſéen no more: Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Pallace, and ſéeing none of thoſe five which were departed in the ſearch of <hi>Palmendos,</hi> he could not tell what to imagine. Of every one he deſired to be reſolved; yet could he not be anſwered to his content; wherefore <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the ſolemn feaſt for the marriage was ended, the Knights returned to their own Countreys; ſo did <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treus</hi> and <hi>Eſquivela</hi> toward <hi>Hungaria,</hi> with an honourable train ſent by the Emperour. <hi>Philocriſta</hi> was ſorry for the departure of <hi>Eſquivela,</hi> whom ſhe loved as if ſhe had been her ſiſter, becauſe from their young years they were edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated together: Nor could <hi>Abenunco</hi> her brother go with them ſo far as happily he would, becauſe the league of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

               <p>Sir Knight, I think my ſelf favoured of Fortune by

méeting you here, in that I left the Emperours Court for nothing elſe but to ſéek you, becauſe his Majeſty deſireth to ſée and know you in reſpect of your brave behaviour a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Tourney; therefore I intreat you, for the love you bear his highneſs, to return back with me, that I may diſcharge my promiſe herein to his Majeſty. You did not well, ſir (anſwered <hi>Palmendos</hi>) to promiſe any thing depending on another mans will; and for that at this time I have urgent occaſions elſewhere, I cannot ſatisfie his Highneſs deſire, albeit I am ready in any thing elſe to do him ſervice: and ſo I beſéech you anſwer on my behalf. Knight (quoth <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes</hi>) I pray you conſider hereon a little better, and think that ſuch ſpéeches cannot diſcharge me of my duty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determine right ſoon to go with me willingly, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I muſt compel you to return perforce. Perforce? no, (ſaid <hi>Palmendos</hi>) well may I go with my will, if ſo be I pleaſe. I wiſh it for your good (anſwered <hi>Arnedes</hi>) and the remembrance of your valour in the Tourney, cauſeth me to bear with you very much: but ſéeing you will not willingly yéeld hereto, provide for the combat; and think not that your bravery at the triumph, ſhall any thing avail you now in this place. If you will néeds inforce me to it (quoth <hi>Palmendos</hi>) let yours be the ſhame: as for my ſelf, in reſpect of my love to the Emperor, I would be loath to combat with you. Hereupon they ſo furiouſly encountred together, that both of them were ſent to the ground; and afterward they fought a cruel combat at the ſword, till <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes</hi> with the great expence of his bloud, having received many a grievous wound, fell down at the Prince of <hi>Thar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> féet, who having made clean his ſword, that was very bloudy, and put it into the ſheath ſaid.</p>

moved with charity and compaſſion, came down the Mountain, to ſuccour <hi>Arnedes,</hi> who lay bléeding in the graſs and unclaſping his Helmet to give him air in ſhort time he recovered his ſences again: when ſéeing none but the Hermit, and that the Knight was gone, he reputed it for an act of great humanity, in not killing him out-right, his life ſtanding at his mercy: Afterward he thus ſpake to himſelf. What ſhall I now do, if not complain of the inſtability of Fortune? was not my comming into theſe Countreys unhappy where I thought to win honour and renown, when all things turn to my ſhame and reproof? ſith my ſtrength is not correſpondent to the valour of my mind, I muſt give over the exerciſe of Arms, which For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (I ſée) envies I ſhould follow.

               <p>My ſon, give thanks to him that delivered thée out of the Knights hands, and hath not ſuffered both body and ſoul to periſh: Let idle and undecent thoughts be now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned and lift thy mind to the place of eternal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. With theſe words he bound up his wounds ſo well as he could, minding to lead him to his Hermitage. But as one miſchance happeneth not alone, ſo fell it out at this inſtant: for he was no ſooner gotten on foot, but <hi>Lecefin</hi> his mortal enemy arrived; and knowing him to be his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in love, drawing his ſword, thus ſpake.</p>
               <p>Now ſhall I teach thée, my capital enemy, what it is to love her whom thou art not worthy to ſerve, and that ſhall I make thée preſently confeſs or buy thy boldneſs with the price of thy bloud; for a Lady of ſo care perfections, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth too high out of a Frenchmans reach. Herewith he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently ſtrook at <hi>Arnedes,</hi> whom the good old Hermit ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch dangerous caſe, did take him in his arms, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring <hi>Lecefin</hi> not to ſeek his death, that had of late e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ah dogged and diſloyal Traytor (ſaid <hi>Arnedes,</hi> when he beheld this tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal act) why haſt thou ſlain this religious Father that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offended thee? the Heavens I hope will not let thée paſs unpuniſhed, but plague thée as ſuch a damnable déed requireth.</p>
               <p>So taking his ſword as well as he might, by reaſon of his former hurts, he ſought to defend himſelf and revenge the Hermits death: but all was in vain; for (without a marvellous chance) <hi>Arnedes</hi> death was now ordained. In a happy hour arrived there <hi>Pernedin</hi> ſon to the Duke of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> one of them that departed in the ſearch of <hi>Palmendos,</hi> who knowing both the combatants ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At theſe words, <hi>Lecefin</hi> was ſo aſhamed of himſelf, as mounting preſently on <hi>Arnedes</hi> horſe, he rode away not ſpeaking to either of them, knowing he had notoriouſly blemiſhed his honour: wherefore he went to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Well may <hi>Lecefin</hi> reſemble the Soldan his father, a man full of treacherous and ignoble practiſes; but he muſt not thus think to wrong a Prince of <hi>France.</hi> So ſtepping frowningly from his Chair, he went to the Princes chamber to ſee him, charging his Phyſitians and Chirurgians to tend him as well as if they had his own perſon in cure.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Arnedes</hi> revealed the whole diſcourſe of that which happened between <hi>Palmendos</hi> and him, at the end whereof the Emperor thus anſwered. I wonder that the Knight ſhould be ſo deſirous to do me ſervice, and yet doth ſly in this ſort from me; doubtleſs he is gone to prove the adventure of <hi>Francelina,</hi> if he rode that way you ſay he did, and it may be his fortune to end it, I hope, except our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Belcar</hi> exceed him in valour, and that I can hardly beleeve he will.</p>
               <p>When the Emperor departed, he commanded that the Empreſs and her daughters ſhould go viſit the Prince, which ſhe accordingly did, taking <hi>Philocriſta</hi> and <hi>Melicia</hi> with her, ſhe being greatly offended at the injury done to

                  </hi> very much bemoned his miſhap, yet wiſely and diſcreetly as became a ſober virgin; for the love ſhe bare him was derived from gentleneſs and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which ſhe noted him to prefer in all his actions, and nothing had ſhe in more eſpecial account, then to conſerve her chaſtity pure and unſpotted. <hi>Arnedes</hi> was joyfull to ſee her he loved ſo dearly, how ſhe ſorrowed for his hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and blamed <hi>Lecefin</hi> as a diſloyal Traytor: which gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpeeches did more comfort his heart then all the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick or cunning in the world could do.</p>
               <p>While the Empreſs and her daughters beguiled the time with him, <hi>Amenada</hi> a woman Dwarf that attended on <hi>Philocriſta,</hi> and <hi>Riſdeno</hi> her Nephew, came to <hi>Bruquel, Arnedes</hi> Dwarf, who uſed ſundry lamentations, for the great miſhap had befallen his Maſter. <hi>Amenada</hi> comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in the beſt ſort ſhe could, ſaying, that in reſpect his wounds were not mortal, there was no doubt but he would ſoon recover them; and the rather, becauſe the Emperour had given ſuch charge of him, as his own perſon could not be better attended.

               <p>Ah my noble Lord <hi>Arnedes,</hi> how dear doth her beauty coſt thee, for whom thou lefteſt thy Countrey? where the onely reputation of thine eſtate, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

promiſe you to ask him the queſtion, and if he be pleaſed, I will ſatisfie your deſire.</p>

                  <hi>Melicia,</hi> who was earneſt in affection to know more as concerning her Lover <hi>Recinde,</hi> ſeeing theſe Myrmedons thus conferring together, and over-hearing ſome of their ſpeeches, after they were departed to their chambers, ſhe demanded of <hi>Amenada,</hi> what talk ſhe had with <hi>Arnedes</hi> Dwarf: whereupon ſhe repeated the whole diſcourſe, to the no little content of <hi>Philocriſta,</hi> becauſe this way ſhe might attain to more knowledge of the French Prince. And as ſhe heard her ſay, that he left his Countrey for the love of a Lady, ſhe preſumed immediately her ſelf to be ſame, for commonly, it falls out, that Lovers will favour themſelves in ſemblable judgements &amp; conjectures: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe commanded <hi>Amenada,</hi> to await <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The dwarf when he ſaw conuenient time to talk with his Maſter, he gave him to underſtand what had paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Amenada,</hi> which pleaſed him ſo well as nothing could do more, &amp; commended to him the purſuit of his practice. On the morrow, the Emperour and <hi>Primale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> dined together, wherefore <hi>Amenada</hi> went to find out <hi>Bruquell</hi> at his lodging, and he méeting her by the way, firſt of all told her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would perform the promiſe he made the day before: but (quoth he) before I ſatisfie you herein, I muſt requeſt one thing of you.</p>
               <p>Demand hardly what thou wilt quoth <hi>Amenada,</hi> for thy ſute being honeſt, thou canſt not be denied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me then, ſaid <hi>Bruquel,</hi> that to no living creature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Madam <hi>Philocriſta,</hi> you diſcloſe what I ſhall reveal to you. So is it <hi>Amenada,</hi> that for the love of her onely, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes</hi> my honourable Lord and Maſter, eldeſt ſon to the King of <hi>France,</hi> hath forſaken his native Country, in that the renown of her excellent beauty ſpread by fame through all thoſe parts, cauſed him to cut through the dangerous ſeas, to credit with his eys what his ears were cloid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52643:59"/>
And having at ful contemplated her ſwéet face, he finds that nature willing induſtriouſly to imbelliſh the chief piece of work, hath taken all ability from human report, how curious or eloquent ſoever it be, thorowly to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the praiſe of her merit: wherefore he hath ſent a Currier to the King his father, that his Majeſty ſhould ſend Embaſſadors hither to confer with the Emperour on a marriage betwéen my Maſter and your Lady, and till they come to diſpatch this occaſion, he will not be known hereof to any one, except it be to her gracious ſelf onely. Humbly then deſire her, with ſome benigne clemency to intreat the heart, which her divine figure hath ſecretly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed and made her thrall, ſo ſhall ſhe give cure to his wounds, &amp; make him the moſt fortunate Champion that ever entred field for his Lady: otherwiſe he can not long injoy his vital motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by his death ſhall occaſion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other beſide, eſpecially his couſin <hi>Recinde,</hi> ſon to the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who loveth him as his proper life, and as he bare him company in this voyage, ſo will he take part of the hardeſt fortune, for the love and near alliance, that is betwéen them.</p>
               <p>So, well could this tall Pigmy uſe his language to gain ſucceſſe for his Maſters intent, as he made no more differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwéen the two Princes, in reſpect of their loyal u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity together: then was betwéen the two Pythagorick companions, <hi>Oreſtes</hi> and <hi>Pylades,</hi> or <hi>Niſus</hi> and <hi>Eurialus,</hi> that would one die for another.

               <p>In ſooth, if I had not promiſed to acquaint my Lady herewith, I durſt not for my life diſcover ſuch weighty matters, becauſe I cannot tell her the whole diſcourſe, in that her Siſter <hi>Melicia</hi> is never from her, and then ſhall

This he ſpake, for that ſhe had her part in the play, namely by her love to the Prince <hi>Recinde,</hi> and if perhaps <hi>Philocriſta</hi> ſhould be ſlow or opinitive in her love, <hi>Melicia</hi> happily would councel her not to refuſe ſo good an offer, in brief, that they might reciprocally adviſe one another, as ſick folks who had ſurfeited both of one diſeaſe, and ſo oftentimes it comes to paſſe, that two thoughts afflicted with one kind of martyrdom, receive together more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, then they could by any other that féel not the like torment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bruquel</hi> having done his indeavour, for the conciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Philocriſta</hi> with his Maſter, returned immediately to him, whom he found attending in ſilent devotion, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the iſſue of this amorous ſtratagem, and after that the dwarf had word by word recounted all his negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <hi>Arnedes</hi> was wrapt in ſuch unſpeakable joy, as he imagined the hour happy when he met with ſuch an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Truch man; <hi>Amenada</hi> on the other ſide, when ſhe eſpied time for the purpoſe, interpreted ſo well and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the intent of the Prince to her miſtreſſe <hi>Philocriſta,</hi> as ſhe therewith was carried into a thouſand imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And albeit the Knight deſpaired not in his ſute, but rather imagined ſo ſweet a countenance would be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to mercy: yet ſhe had ſo loſt her liberty in this cauſe, by ſeeing her beloved ſo dangerouſly wounded, as now ſhe feared to ſend him any ſevere or rigorous anſwer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe thus ſpake to her Dwarf. I am offended that thou didſt promiſe <hi>Bruquel</hi> to acquaint me with this news, but ſeeing what hath happened cannot be prevented thou ſhalt then go to <hi>Arnedes,</hi> and tell him from me, that I marvell he would thruſt himſelf into many perils, for which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

From the Court of the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> anſwered <hi>Rifarano.</hi> How happy then am I, ſaid the Dwarf, to meet you here, becauſe I have evermore heard, that thence comes many good and vertuous Knights, wherefore I ſhall pray (in reſpect of the good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wiſh to ſo benigne a Prince) that you may ſoon find the man you look for, and likewiſe that his Majeſty may pitty my cauſe, in revenging me on a Knight that hath ſhamefully outraged me, I giving him no cauſe of offence in the world.

               <p>Know gentle Knight, that albeit God hath faſhioned me as you ſée yet did he beſtow on me riches and poſſeſſions &amp; among other things I have a ſtrong Caſtle not far hence, there fell I in love with a beautifull damoſel.

ſuch ſort, as ſoon after I enjoyed her in marriage. Living afterward in all proſperous felicity, we walked abroad to recreate our ſelves, in a pleaſant field near adjoyning to my houſe, where this proud and diſcourteous Knight (who long laboured to have my Wife in marriage, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his evil conditions could not obtain her) came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with two of his Kinſmen (as bad diſpoſed men as himſelf) and there took my Wife perforce from me, carrying her to a caſtle of his two days journy from hence, where he kéepeth her under ſtrong guard, and hath ſent me word by one of his Squires, that if I complain hereof to any living creature, he will come and kill me with his own hand in my Caſtle. Yet being unable to endure this villanous oppreſſion. I am going to tell my cauſe to the Emperor <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who I hope will ſpéedily do me juſtice herein, being a Prince thereto greatly addicted, as I have heard report.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rifarano</hi> marvelling at this horrible injury, ſaid to the Dwarf. Shew me the Caſtle where the Knight abideth; for I doubt not but to do ſo much in the right of thy cauſe, as he ſhall yeeld recompence for this fault, and fear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to offer the like to any one, without any further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Emperour herein. The Dwarf accepting this friendly offer, that night lodged <hi>Rifarano</hi> at his Caſtle, where he was exceeding well entertained, and on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, taking ſix Squires with them, rode to the Knights Caſtle, where eſpying one upon the walls, <hi>Rifarano</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded if his Lord were within. Marry is he (anſwered the Squire on the walls) he is now ſporting himſelf with that tall fellows love: but I am ſorry that you would be ſo badly counſelled (quoth he to <hi>Rifarano</hi>) as to come to end your life in this peace. Be not thou ſo carefull for me (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Rifarano</hi>) but go, and let thy Maſter underſtand, that I would ſpeak two or thrée words with him, on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain matters that very nearly concern his honour. The Squire went preſently to his Maſter, who hearing that the

Dwarf had brought a Knight with him, took the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman by the hand, and brought her with him to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, where opening the caſements that they might ſée her, ſaid.</p>

I had not thought replyed the knight of the Caſtle) that thy indiſcretion had been ſo great, as to think I would win a thing ſo hardly, and deliver it from me ſo lightly; nor ſhall the paragon of my heart be again in the cuſtody of ſo baſe an excrement of nature. Then he ſpake to the Dwarf in this manner.</p>
               <p>Thou wretched and ridiculous creature, commeſt thou likewiſe to make one in the Tragedy? begin with thine own hand thou wert beſt, or I ſhall plague thee with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream torments. So took he the Gentlewoman in his arms, and oftentimes laſciviouſly kiſſed her, ſhe ſtriving in tears to hinder his imbracings, wherefore he ſaid. Good Madame, ſeek no occaſion whereby to offend your ſelf; for you ſhall ſee me pluck down the bravery of this Knight, and make the monſter your husband ſafe from troubling you any more. Tuſh theſe are but words (quoth <hi>Rifarano</hi>) let me ſee thee come armed into the field, then ſhall I live in hope of ſome deeds: And if thou wilt have me imagine thée couragious, bring down the Lady with thée, that the conqueror may carry her whither him pleaſeth.

               <p>Many humble thanks ſhe requited him withal, ſéeing her ſelf free from this injurious enemy; and the Dwarf ſeeing this fortunate ſucceſs, came and humbled himſelf at the conquerors feet, imbracing his wife with abundance of joy, being neither of them able to expreſs their contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that tears and inward motions of comfort had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them of ſpeech. Afterward the Knight had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf again, and came ſtealing on <hi>Rifarano</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to murther him but the Dwarf eſpying him, cryed out; whereupon the Prince returned, and once more getting him into ſubjection, with his his ſword ſmote his head from his ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>The Dwarf not a little joyfull for this victory, deſired the Prince that he would accompany him to his Caſtle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that trayterous Knight had a brother and two cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins who hearing of his death would preſently purſue them Whereto <hi>Rifarano</hi> courteouſly condeſcended, and mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gentlewoman behind her husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they journied thence with all ſpeed poſſible.

               <p>
                  <hi>Palmendos</hi> perceiving how his firſt adverſary would trouble him no further approached to the gates of the firſt Tower, where he beheld the great Knight ready to offer

               <p>After theſe words, he cloſely buckled with the Knight of the Bridge, continuing a long, dangerous and doubtful combat with him, the Dwarf in the Lant horn ſundry times with his Horn renuing his Champions forces: yet by the man of invincible courage, who was ordained to be his Conquerour, he was confounded maugre all his divel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh helps. So forward he marched to the ſecond Tower, and as the gates were clapping together, according as they did to the Prince <hi>Belcar,</hi> he thruſt his Sword betwéen the gates, when immediately the thunder ceaſed, and they fell back wide open as they were before.</p>
               <p>At this good hap the beholders were greatly amazed, eſpecially the Queen of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> who followed on ſtill accompanied with <hi>Ozalio,</hi> and to him ſhe highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the worthy behaviour of this Knight: <hi>Ozalio</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her, that ſhe had good cauſe to applaud her ſtars, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent hither a Knight of ſuch royal diſcent, as his like was not to be found through all the Chriſtian kingdomes. <hi>Tirendos</hi> in this while was carried into his Tent by his Squires, where he ſo grieved for his diſgrace, as he was ready to die in deſpight thereof.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rancelina</hi> already had felt the flames of love, in as vehement manner as the Prince <hi>Palmendos,</hi> becauſe the Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies (knowing the end of the inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was at hand) told her that ere long ſhe ſhould be conquered, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that Caſtle by one of the beſt Knights in the world, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her birth appointed his wife, in recompence of his adventurous travels.</p>
               <p>And this diſcourſe ſhe ſealed with ſo many rare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the Knight, as her heart was ſurpriſed with love in ſuch ſort, that ſhe longed every hour to ſée the man appointed for her husband. And as the Pilot long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with outragious tempeſts, mounts to the top to ſée if any Haven for reſcue is at hand: ſo this Lady toſſed too and fro in the rough billows of love, oftentimes left her Dungeon and came upon the walls expecting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this promiſed Knight. By good hap ſhe eſpied when <hi>Palmendos</hi> came to the bridge, beſide the trembling of the Caſtle at the departure of the Knights, touched her heart with a ſign of preſent comfort, whereupon in this bravery ſhe went with her damoſels into the garden, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the iſſue of the Knights fortune that preſaged ſo much before hand. In brief, he being entred the garden,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52643:67"/>
as you have heard already, ſhe being directed by the Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries what ſhe ſhould do, when ſhe perceived the dogs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, aroſe with her Damoſels, and went towards the Knight, ſhewing many gracious countenances for his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; but <hi>Palmendos</hi> ſeeing her approach ſo near him, fell on his knee, offering to kiſs her hand, whereat <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celina</hi> baſhfully bluſhing, offered him the like, ſaying.</p>
               <p>It is my duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir Knight, to uſe ſuch humility, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit your courteſſe hath prevented me, for this wonderfull adventure finiſhed by you declares your rare perfection in Chivalry, being ſecond to none that at this day beareth Arms. Yet ere you take me hence, I would requeſt one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at your hands not any thing to make you doubt the loſſe of her, who fréely giveth her ſelf as your own, but for that you have delivered me from the inchantment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt granted, you may diſpoſe of me as your loyal ſpouſe and wife. Madam anſwered <hi>Palmendos,</hi> I now think my ſelf no leſſe beloved of heaven, then favoured by fortune, hearing you ſay that I am yours, and you are mine, which makes me think all my labors nothing in reſpect of you: therefore dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A thouſand thanks good Knight (qd. ſhe) albeit ſuch ſpéech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es agrée not with your calling, I being onely in your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and ready to attend as your hand-maiden: but me thinks it were neceſſary you ſhould take a little reſt being good to regard the end and period of all things, let me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly intreat you, to come refreſh your ſelf for the better conſervation of your health.</p>
               <p>So went they both together to the Fountain, where <hi>Palmendos</hi> was unarmed by the Princeſſe <hi>Francelina</hi> and her damoſels, and a coſtly Mantle was brought to wrap about him, then ſate he down by his Lady, in another chair covered all over with Gold. There was Lillies, Roſes, Violets, and all the ſweet flowers that the earth afforded, &amp; of incomparable beauty: the maidens beguiled the time
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52643:67"/>
with ſundry ſounds of inſtruments, and thereto ſung ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dainty Canzonets, as if <hi>Apollo, Orpheus, Arion,</hi> and all the other fathers of heavenly Muſick had been preſent, which ſo attracted the ſences of the Prince, as his memory began to wax drowſie and forgetfull imagining himſelf in a very beatitude, where he ſeemed to ſee, not onely the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beauty of a Goddeſs but a divine ſhadow, which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away both his heart and eys in contemplation.</p>
               <p>Of the like opinion was the young Princeſs, marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the brave conſtitution of her Knight, and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf beyond all other in happineſs, that Fortune had ſorted her out ſuch a husband: and in ſooth theſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were the faireſt couple that ever were joyned in marriage together, not unfitly compared to <hi>Leander</hi> and <hi>Hero,</hi> the two goodlieſt ſtars that were in their times. In this ſurpaſſing contentation, they continued till a Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel (underſtanding that ſupper was prepared) there ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them a table ready covered the wood whereof was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precious, delivering a ſavour much like to Balm and thereon was ſet all ſorts of coſtly viands: hard by ſtood a Cupboard richly adorned with Baſons and Cups of gold, which were embelliſhed with ſuch precious ſtones, as the value of them was reputed ineſtimable.</p>
               <p>But theſe Lovers could eat very little, becauſe they had work enough to regard each other; for there is nothing in the world more agreeable to one enamoured, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the object of his thoughts, becauſe love making a breach into the body, and planting his ſiege againſt the very ſoul, hinders the paſſage of nouriſhing meats, and makes them feed on his lovely deviſes, which are ſuch as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of you that have taſted thereof, can beſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the pleaſure and ſwéetneſſe thereof.

               <p>In this ſort ſupped <hi>Palmendos</hi> and <hi>Francelina,</hi> when the damoſels withdrawing the Table, went to take their own refection, leaving theſe twain to deviſe together: Then approached the Knight to the Miſtreſs of his heart, and ſaid.

By this time the Knight of the Iſle had made ſuch proviſion in the Caſtle as they might there lodge according to their content, becauſe more convenient place there was not near at hand, and there three days they ſported themſelves in pleaſure, marvelling at the ingenious deviſes there fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Fairies, ſo that the Caſtle ſeemed as a terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Paradiſe.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ecinde</hi> leaving <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for the ſame cauſe as the other Knights did, happened to the ſame place where <hi>Palmendos</hi> lodged the night before, demanding of his Hoſt, if he had ſéen any ſuch man: who made this anſwer. Verily the ſame man that had the honour of the Tourney, was my gueſt this laſt night, and never did I ſee a more courteous Gentleman, which makes me hope, he will end the adventure of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celina,</hi> whither he is gone as he told me he would. With theſe words the Spaniard was well contented, minding to follow him to the Iſle of <hi>Carderia,</hi> and riding by the way, he heard a very lamentable cry, which cauſed him to look about, when he eſpied one hanging on a tree by the arms, and five villains hard by, making a fire, to dreſs ſome food they had killed on the mountain. Comming to the man that hung in this woful plight, he cut him down; and underſtanding that theſe villains had robbed and ſo miſuſed him, he cauſed the Merchant to take his weapon, and ſo they ſetting upon the Thieves, ſlew three of them, driving the other to flight: by which means the Merchant had moſt of his treaſure again, for which he thanked the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52643:74"/>
Prince: and mounting on horſeback, he accompanied him on the way.</p>
               <p>Not far had they gone, but they met a Knight unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of huge conſtitution and evil favoured, having a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie bow in his hand and a quiver hanging by his ſide full of arrows, of whom they deſired to know which way they ſhould get out of the Forreſt: The diſcourteous Knight (without making any anſwer) let fly an arrow at them, wherewith he killed the Prince <hi>Recindes</hi> horſe; he being not a little moved at this miſhap, grew into a great choler againſt him, who made no longer ſtay, but ran from them ſo faſt as he could. <hi>Recinde</hi> and the Merchant ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, till having loſt the ſight of him, and marvelling where he ſhould be hidden at length they found the mouth of a very dark Cave, which they ſuſpected the Knight had taken for refuge: whereupon the Prince intreated the Merchant to ſtay there without, becauſe he intended to ſearch the Cave, and be revenged on him that had ſo wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him.</p>
               <p>Not far had he gone under the earth, but he heard a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull voice crying for help, which cauſed him to return back again, when at the entrance of the Vault he beheld a mighty Lion, which came forth with the Knight, and ran upon the Prince exceeding furiouſly: but he who could not be frighted with matters of greater moment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly defended himſelf againſt the beaſt, as in ſhort time he laid him dead at his foot. Now ran the Knight back again into the cave, and the Prince after him ſo faſt as he could, till at length he came into a goodly Hall, which was hanged round about with gorgeous Tapiſtry, and therein might one behold all ſuch as paſſed by the mouth of the cave, as if they had diſcerned the ſame in a Glaſſe. While he ſtood beholding this beautifull proſpect, he ſaw the Knight comming towards him armed, and drawing his ſword, thus ſpake to the Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:52643:74"/>Wretched Knight, overmuch fooliſh hardineſs hath brought thée to this place, for I ſhall let thee ſée the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger incurred by thy preſumption. More indiſcreetly (quoth the Prince) haſt thou behaved thy ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in killing my horſe without any occaſion of offence. Herewith they combatted a long while together, till the Knight ſeeing himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reſiſt the Prince, would have ſaved himſelf in the chamber he came from, offering to keep the door againſt him as his defence: but <hi>Recinde</hi> thruſting after him into the chamber, he beheld a great and hideous Dragon lying there, the ſight whereof ſomewhat amazed him; yet ſeeing the beaſt ſtirred not againſt him he continued his former quarrel with the Knight, bringing him at length into ſuch ſubjection, that with his ſword he ſmote his head from his ſhoulders. The Serpent terrified with extream fear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhrink back, when <hi>Recinde</hi> lifting up his ſword to ſtrike, the Serpent ſpake in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, for Gods ſake pity me, and ſeek not to ſhed my bloud, having no way offended you; ſo ſhall I be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually bound at your commandement, for delivering me from this cruel Knight who hath forcibly kept me here the ſpace of ſix years. The Prince hearing theſe words, held down his ſword, when the Serpent thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. I am no Serpent, ſir, as happily I ſeem in your eye, but a moſt infortunate and abuſed damoſel having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the moſt miſerable life that ever woman endured, living (againſt my will) in the cuſtody of this traiterous Knight. If thou art a humane creature (anſwered <hi>Recin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>) I marvel thou ſhouldeſt have the ſhape of ſuch a defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med beaſt. I know (ſaid the damoſel) what repreſentation I have in your judgement; but I dare aſſure you on my life that I am no Serpent or any thing elſe but a moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed woman.

               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:52643:75"/>He loved this Damoſel ſo extreamly, ſhe being the daughter of an ancient widdow, dwelling not far off, as ſéeing he could not obtain her in marriage, by reaſon of his bad manners, and ill favoured body, ſo laboured with a Magician, a friend of his, to cauſe her to reſemble a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to any but himſelf. Her mother and brethren (being ignorant of this treachery) ſéeing ſuch an ugly Serpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them were ſo affrighted at this ſtrange metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis, that they fled preſently out of their Caſtle. The Damoſel following to underſtand the cauſe of their fear, wandred ſorrowfully after them thorow the fields, where ſhe was ſurprized by her Lover, and brought to the Cave prepared by the Sorcerer, appointing ſhe ſhould continue in that appearance, untill one of the beſt Knights in the world ſhould arrive there, and valiantly win her out of his cuſtody, onely by his death to be delivered, and ſix years ſhe had abode in that place, ſéeming a beautifull woman to her Lover onely, and to all others a monſtrous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Recinde</hi> driven into wonderfull admiration bemoaning her cauſe, thus ſpake. In ſooth this is the moſt ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that ever I heard of; but ſeeing your Lover is dead, boldly may you depart the chamber, and return home to your mother again; for in time (perhaps) this hideous ſhape will forſake you. My Lord (quoth ſhe) I have many times ſtriven to get forth of this priſon, but all my labour hath béen in vain; for by like ſortiledge hath the Knight bound me here, as he got me from my mothers Caſtle. So am I perſwaded (anſwered the Prince;) wherefore ſéeing of your ſelf you cannot depart, I will try if my ſtrength wil releaſe you of this ſervitude. Then taking his arming girdle from about him, he made it faſt about the Serpents middle and forcibly thought to pull her out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but the ſtrength of the inchantment over-maſtering him, when he had gotten her to the very door, would vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently pluck her back again. Yet <hi>Recinde</hi> being all heart
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52643:75"/>
and courage, gave not over for all theſe reſiſtances, but at length by exceeding labour and travel he got her into the Hall, and then ſhe ſeemed a very beautifull woman, who falling down at his feet, intreated him not to forſake her, till that he had brought her to her mothers Caſtle. So going forth of the Cave, ſhe told the Merchant all that had happened, which made him anſwer her in this ſort.</p>
               <p>Madam, both you and I are highly beholding to this Knight, for he hath miraculouſly called you from a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſufferance, and not onely hath he ſaved my life, but helped me to my goods again which were utterly loſt: wherefore we have good cauſe to think that he is the onely Paragon of Chivalry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So breaking of theſe ſpeeches they took the Knights horſe, becauſe he had ſlain the Princes, and mounting the damoſel behind him, brought her home to her mothers Caſtle, the ancient Lady being not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle joyfull to ſee her daughter, whom ſhe reputed utterly loſt: likewiſe her brethren were very glad to ſee their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter reſtored home again.

               </p>
               <p>Now come we to the Damoſel again, that purſued <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> for the death of her brethren, according as you have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently heard before. She underſtanding that he was in the Court of <hi>Macedon,</hi> ſo highly loved of the King Queen, and the whole nobility ſhe was out of hope to work him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny injury there; wherefore ſhe intended to return home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and by the way ſhe hapned to meet with the Prince <hi>Recinde,</hi> when beginning her accuſtomed complaints, ſhe delivered the ſame diſcourſe which ſhe had done to <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> and <hi>Tirendos,</hi> ſaying, that the Knight who had ſo tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly ſlain her brethren, ſojourned in the Court of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon.</hi>

If it be, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel, as you ſay, that the Knight in ſuch trayterous ſort ſlew your brethren, I promiſe you, by the faith I bear to Chivalry, that to my power I will revenge your wrong, becauſe all Gentlemen receiving this Order, are bound by duty to aſſiſt Damoſels injuriouſly wronged by diſloyal varlets. The crafty deceiver fell at the Princes feet, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming what ſhe had ſaid with many oaths.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:52643:77"/>Sée here, my Lord, the Knight that ſlew my brethren: I beſeech you make him know before the King, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he committed againſt harmleſs men: for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty not knowing the enormity of the caſe, reputeth this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender to be one of the moſt courteous Knights in his Court as my ſelf perceived at my laſt being here. <hi>Recinde</hi> having with humble reverence ſaluted the King <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi> turned to <hi>Belcar</hi> with theſe ſpéeches. Sir Knight, this Damoſel hath ſworn to me, that you have trayterouſly ſlain two of her brethren, after you had béen friendly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at her fathers houſe: if you did ſo, ſurely it was an act far unbeſéeming you, and by force of arms I ſhall make you ſo to confeſs it, if you have the hardineſs to enter the field with me. <hi>Belcar</hi> greatly offended to hear himſelf ſo charged, and evermore by one that ſought to bring his life in danger, in anger thus replied.</p>
               <p>In ſooth, Knight, I cannot but think thy diſcretion ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſimple, in ſaying, if I have the hardineſs to enter the field with thée; and thy preſumption is as inſolent, as this Damoſel is trothleſs and diſloyal, in accuſing me without any cauſe: notwithſtanding I hope to recompence you for light belief, and that falſe woman likewiſe, the inſtrument of thy folly. After theſe ſpeeches he went and armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the combat, which the King many ways laboured to hinder; but <hi>Recinde</hi> continued ſo reſolutely againſt <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> that the King could not diſſwade the matter, wherfore he thus ſpake to <hi>Recinde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Séeing you will not at my intreaty give over this raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let me underſtand the name of him that will not grant ſo ſmall a matter, eſpecially to one that is able to yéeld thanks therefore. I am (quoth <hi>Recinde</hi>) a Knight of a ſtrange Country, who came to the Emperors Court at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> mean while the Nuptials of the Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prince were ſolemnized, whither likewiſe came a Knight unknown, bearing a ſilver flower in his ſhield: he having won the honour of the Tourney, departed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52643:77"/>
from the aſſembly, which made me follow in ſearch of him: and in reſpect I am but a poor Knight errant. I deſire no wrong may be offered me in the battel. Be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aſſured, ſaid the King that none ſhall meddle with you but your adverſary onely: And truſt me it grieveth me to the very heart, that comming from the Court of the Emperour <hi>Palmerin</hi> my ſon you ſhould here enter the field againſt <hi>Belcar,</hi> who is one of his Majeſties chiefeſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. When <hi>Recinde</hi> heard <hi>Belcar</hi> named, on the one ſide it diſpleaſed him, that he was to deal with a Knight ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowned; on the other ſide it grieved him as much, when he conſidered the near alliance betwéen him and <hi>Melicia,</hi> whom he loved as his very ſoul, ſo that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly he would have forborn the combat but that he could not with honour gainſay it.</p>
               <p>Now the King deſires the Duke of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and another of his chiefeſt Barons, to judge the fight according to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and without any exception oi perſon. Soon after the champions enter the Liſts where breaking their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces bravely in the carréer they were both diſmounted: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they quickly recovered themſelvs and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſwords fell to the combat. Long while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a moſt furious fight ſharp and cruel wounds being delivered on either ſide, that judgment could not be given who was in greateſt danger: but his Majeſty ſéeing <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> wax féeble, and that it was like this fight would end both their lives, as one loth to ſée the death of either, he threw his ſtaff of peace betwéen them; and coming down from the window where he ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>od into the field he deſired them at his requeſt to give over the fight. My gracious Lord, anſwered <hi>Recinde,</hi> that may we not conſent unto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Damoſel that complained of <hi>Belcar,</hi> will firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the injury he hath done her. My ſelf will thereto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her, ſaid the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in mean while do you travel no further in this controverſie, ſeeing you have both ſhewed ſufficient and haughty chivalry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:52643:78"/>So went the King to the Damoſel, who was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full glad to ſee <hi>Belcar</hi> in ſuch dangerous eſtate, as no Knight before had brought him in the like. Damoſel (ſaid he) ſéek not the death of two ſo good Champions as theſe are, but (for my ſake) pardon <hi>Belcar,</hi> if he have in ought offended, and I ſhall cauſe him to make ſuch amends, as your ſelf ſhall like well thereof: beſide, ſuch courteſie ſhall you find at my hands, as happily ſhall yéeld occaſion of thanks while you live. Hereto will I never conſent, though I die (quoth ſhe) and more would the preſent death of <hi>Belcar</hi> content me, then if the whole Monarchy of the world were under my puiſſance, conſidering the enorm and deteſtable treaſon wherewith he villanouſly wronged my father and brethren, which makes me I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my Knight of his promiſe. The King with great inſtance intreated her again, and ſo did all the Lords at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on him: but all was in vain, ſhe was ſo reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded in her wickedneſs, as ſhe accounted it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be ſelf-willed therein. Whereupon, the Queen (heartily ſorry to ſee <hi>Belcar</hi> ſo ſore wounded) underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obſtinate refuſal of the Damoſel; ſhe accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Alde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi> her daughter, came altogether and deſired her, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge her Knight of his promiſe, and the Queen would entertain her amongſt the Ladies of Honour in her Court.</p>
               <p>All theſe prayers and requeſts nothing availed, to move any pity in this inexorable Damoſel; which the Queen perceiving, and that ſhe continued ſo obſtinate in cruelty, ſhe made a ſolemn oath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if ſhe did not preſently par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the two Knights, (hearing a murmuring among the the people, how her accuſations againſt <hi>Belcar</hi> were falſe and ſlanderous) that her ſelf ſhould die a moſt ſhameful death. The Damoſel ſeeing the Queen ſo diſpleaſed, was affraid of her cauſe, and beſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe grieved to behold the tears of fair <hi>Alderina,</hi> wherefore ſhe alighted from her pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52643:78"/>
and falling at the Queens feet, deſired her not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard her great errour of ingratitude, which ſhe had ſhewed to the King her husband, in denying a matter conſiſting in her power: but for her Majeſties ſake, ſhe was content to pardon both the Knights. The Queen embraced her in ſign of thanks, ſending word to <hi>Recinde,</hi> that he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further in battel. So the Damoſel went with the Queen and her Ladies to the Pallace, and both the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions accompanied the King, who bringing them to their chambers, commanded that his chief Phyſitians and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgians ſhould give very diligent attendance to ſee their wounds healed.</p>
               <p>Daily would the Queen, accompanied with the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and the fair Princeſs <hi>Alderina</hi> her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, come to viſit them, ſo that at length they reconciled the two Princes to amity; and ſhortly after, the Queen (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of her promiſe) cauſed the damoſel to be very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably married, when <hi>Belcar</hi> made her openly confeſs, that her accuſations were moſt falſe and untrue, in reſpect that he never ſaw any of her brethren, before that night where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was intreated by her father to lodge at his Caſtle.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this dare I avouch Sir, that there is no part ſo little in all that country, but I know it as well by night as by day, even as perfectly as the port whereof I tell you: there may you abide in aſſurance and do what beſt your ſelf ſhal pleaſe uncontroled by any, this will I make good for the great courteſie I have found. <hi>Palmendos</hi> ſéeing how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune favoured him committed his conducting to the Turk who was named <hi>Oricano,</hi> when at length they came to the port near <hi>Tubant:</hi> then <hi>Oricano</hi> went on ſhore with the Knights, to take ſome order for their good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but finding not his father at home, intreated his mother and two brethren, who were not a little glad of his ſafe return, to uſe thoſe Gentlemen ſo courteouſly as might be, expreſſing what kindneſſe he had found at their hands.</p>

                  <hi>Palmendos</hi> rejoiced that they were in a place ſo ſure and ſecret, and near <hi>Albayzo</hi> Caſtle, where the King of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> was detained in captivity, yet kept he on his rich black armour, which the Fairies left for him at the Caſtle of <hi>Carderia,</hi> his good ſword likewiſe he had by his ſide, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he could inchant and bring aſléep any one by drawing it forth.

               <p>
                  <hi>Palmendos</hi> attentively noting this tale, conſidered with himſelf, that if he could by ſubtil trains entire this Lady to Love, he might eaſily get into <hi>Albayzo</hi> Caſtle, where he ſhould the better compaſs the ſtratagem, to ſet the King of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> at liberty. For this cauſe he determined to be preſent at the Tourney, and in bed acquainted <hi>Ozalio</hi> with his whole intent, who thought it the onely way to work their enterprize.

               <p>Not far had they rid, but they met with a Page that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on <hi>Iffida,</hi> for ſo was the beautifull virgin named, the Captains daughter, and occaſion of this triumph. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendos</hi> then asked him if the Tourney held the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <p>The Prince calling to mind the perfections of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celina,</hi> breathed forth a ſigh that came from his very ſoul: and on the other ſide he was marvellous glad, that he had ſo fortunately met with the Ladies Page: and being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to gain ſome acquaintance with her, he ſpake to the youth in this manner. Gentleman, I think the graces of your Miſtreſs to be ſo amiable, as in one inſtant they are ſufficient to captivate all ſuch as behold her, and therefore I can aſſure you, that with the better will and more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection is he provided to her ſervice, that never ſaw her; which I ſpeak on mine own behalf, who abandoning the place of my original, have with inſupportable travels croſt many Countreys, onely to come let her underſtand my extream devotion, to be her perpetual and faithfull ſervant, whereto the renown of her beauty induced me, which I think is ſpread over the face of the whole earth. And ſéeing my hap was ſo good to méet with you, albeit you know me not, nor have I yet deſerved any thing at your hand: yet let me intreat you to do one favour for me, the iſſue whereof, beſide your atchievement of notable reputation in debonair courteſie, which all of your young years ought to have in ſingular commendation: I hope I ſhall let you ſufficiently perceive, that you deal not for an ingratefull perſon, nor will ye miſlike your travel in the cauſe.</p>

               <p>Me thinks this is very ſtrange (replied <hi>Iffida</hi>) that this Knight ſhould come from far Countreys to ſee me; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ingratefull might I be reputed, if I ſhould not thank him for ſo great pains; therefore fail not, but ſhew me him to morrow, ſo ſoon as he doth enter the Liſts, that I may give good héed to his behaviour. Herein (quoth the Page) will I accompliſh your command becauſe right well I know him by his rich Armour, as alſo the luſty Courſer herde on yeſterday. Thus made the Page a train for love, which afterward reached to the heart of his Miſtreſs, where having kindled the fire her ſelf, ſhe felt the ſparks ſo to leap about her imaginations, as all this night ſhe could enjoy no reſt, for thinking on the Knight that came from far Countreys.</p>

               <p>Madam (anſwered <hi>Palmendos</hi>) I cannot expreſſe my high good fortune, finding ſuch grace and courteſie at your hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being on my part no way as yet deſerved, but time may yéeld the due to every gentle mind, and make me able to requite ſuch extraordinary favour. And think not ſweet Goddeſſe of my heart, that in pittying the unſupportable burthen of my oppreſſions, you ſhall any way incur the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of lightneſſe, but rather of honourable and well-governed care, when you ſhall behold the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I hope ſafely to bring you: for Madam, ſetting aſide my ſimple outward appearance, I am a King born, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſundry famous Provinces, and this attempt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded onely of religious zeal, to make you Lady of me and mine, as your wondefull fame at firſt took the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of my heart.</p>
               <p>How can I worthy Lord (quoth <hi>Iffida</hi>) but ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; that you being a King and a man of ſo rare fortune in managing Arms, ſhould come hither for ſo ſimple a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel as my ſelf, not worthy to caſt mine eys to ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment? yet not to diſſemble with you as concerning my reſolution, without my fathers conſent, I neither may or will go hence with you, becauſe it were both diſobedience and injury to nature.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, one thing I will do for you, which never heretofore I offered to any Knight I will bring you to my Father, and tell him you are one of this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Nephews, ſhe being my Nurſe in the time of mine infancy: to him muſt you offer your ſervice, and no ſooner ſhall he behold your Knightly chivalry, but he will gladly

accept you as his Son: ſo with my Parents conſent you may convey me hence, and in mean while I ſhall keep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret your eſtate, albeit it were good that you tell him the truth. <hi>Pamendos,</hi> who deſired nothing but to get into the Caſtle, and to compaſs the ſame by any way he could, thus replied.</p>
               <p>Madam, ſuch is the extreamity of my vehement paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as no one can recure them, but ſhe from whom they took their Original; nor do my vital ſpirits receive any force to execute their office, but from your gracious and gentle diſpoſition: therefore I will go with you when you pleaſe to your Father, and ſay what you can beſt imagine, for the peaceable aſſurance and fruition of the good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>Theſe words he uttered with very chearfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, by reaſon of the hope wherewith his heart was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, ſeeing the practiſe of his negotiation ſtand now on the tearms himſelf deſired: the Lady on the other ſide was ſo raviſhed with his love that ſhe could not be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with beholding him, or conſent to forſake his company, till time of conſtraint came that they muſt to their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings where <hi>Iffida</hi> could not ſleep through the whole night, her ſlumbers were ſo broken by the abundance and plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of amorous diſcourſe, which chaſed all other imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from her ſpirit.</p>
               <p>In theſe extreams poor <hi>Iffida</hi> was tormented, a diſeaſe clean contrary to that which troubled <hi>Palmendos,</hi> who onely ſought by diſſimulation to recover the good King of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> whereof he conferred in bed with <hi>Ozalio,</hi> what ſtratagems and ſubtilties he muſt compaſs in the action; intreating him moſt affectionately, they having once get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten entrance into the Caſtle to ſhew himſelf hardy and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, putting every one to the ſword when the watchword ſhould be given. When the morning was come, <hi>Iffida</hi> dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her ſelf in her brave accouſtrements, and coming into the garden, found there y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Knights armed except their

Helmets, ſhe praying them to go with her to the Caſtle of <hi>Albayzo,</hi> that ſhe might have the honour of preſenting them to the Captain her Father.</p>
               <p>This matter being ſoon concluded they all mounted on horſeback, and about noon arrived at the fortreſſe, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ſtructure whereof cauſed <hi>Palmendos</hi> to wonder, in that it was placed on a high and mighty rock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtored with ſuch munition for war, as it was thought impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Being come to the gate, <hi>Iffida</hi> lighted from her hackney and entred taking the Knights by the hand, the Arches permitting them quietly paſſe, without any fear or further inquiry what they were, ſeeing them ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with fair <hi>Iffida,</hi> whom the Captain loved ſo well as none might gain-ſay what ſhe commanded.</p>
               <p>Afterward the bridges were drawn, &amp; the gates ſtrongly barred according as they were wont to be ſo the Princes entring the great Hall, <hi>Palmendos</hi> diligently looked about him, thinking each hour a year till the skirmiſh were ſought in this ſtrong Hold thanking the heavens that had ſo well guided them thither.</p>

Why daughter? how chanceth it that you are come without your brother? My Lord (quoth ſhe) the deſire I had yeſter-night to ſée you, haſtened my return in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your two Squires, my four waiting damoſels, and theſe two Knights, who are both Nephews to my Nurſe, where I found them as I paſſed by that way; and hereof be aſſured good father, that this Knight (pointing to <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendos</hi>) is one of the moſt hardy and courteous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that ever you knew. Whereof his victory in the tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at my brothers marriage, hath given me evident exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as alſo the honeſt ſpeeches he hath uſed to me this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, declaring his earneſt deſire to offer you his ſervice: under hope whereof I have been his guide hither eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the acquiſition of ſuch a man rare, and of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and will chiefly help the ſtrength of your charge.</p>

For all theſe words, he had other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his mind; and becauſe his daughter praiſed him ſo much, ſo much the more willingly could he have ſpared his company in the caſtle, for that his preſence made him miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt and fear ſomewhat: yet to diſſemble the matter, and take away all occaſion of contrary miſtruſt, with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit merry countenance, he ſaid.</p>

               <p>The Page ſéeing this ſudden alteration, driven into as great a quandary as if he had been new metamorphoſed, began to cry out very pittifully tearming this act abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and ſcelerous diſloyalty; wherewith he ran down to advertiſe the Guard thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they themſelves were not far behind him, becauſe <hi>Palmendos</hi> knew this enterprize was not to be deferred, therefore he and <hi>Ozalio</hi> came into the Caſtle Court, where they found the Captain threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the guard, that they had ſo lightly ſuffered the Knights to enter: but they excuſed themſelvs on <hi>Iffida</hi>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus after continued in the Theater of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baizo,</hi> where all they of the Caſtle miſerably ended their lives, except thrée or four damoſels and their waiting women: who likewiſe were ſo amazed at this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpectacle, as they thought themſelves half deprived of life. <hi>Palmendos</hi> being ſtricken in a dump by theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, ſtood a good while not able to ſpeak a word, which his couſin <hi>Ozalio</hi> perceiving, and marvelling at his alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he came and comforted him in this ſort My Lord, you muſt now leave all dumpiſh muſing, and rejoice for your good ſucceſſe in this attempt; never trouble your thoughts with other imaginations, but let us determine our departure hence, before the matter be further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, otherwiſe we may fall in danger a hundred times more to be feared, then were we incloſed in the inextrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Labyrinth.</p>
               <p>Your reaſon is good, couſin (anſwered <hi>Palmendos</hi>) wherefore preſently we wil go ſéek for the priſon, wherein my Lord the King hath béen kept ſo long: after they had ſearched a good while in vain, at length they found him in a ſtrong Tower, bound with huge bars of iron, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſo lean wrinckled, pale and wan, as they marvelled to ſee him ſo withered away.</p>

                  <hi>Palmendos</hi> beholding him in this grievous plight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring this was the father to his beſt beloved <hi>Franceli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> compaſſion cauſed the tears to trickle down his cheeks; but the King not perceiving this humanity, rather ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee their ſwords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo bloudy, thought they were come to end his miſerable and diſtreſſed life, wherefore he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly prepared himſelf thereto, ſaying. Soveraign redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of humane nature, to thee I commdnd my ſoul, which muſt now leave this loathſome priſon; be thou then my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour to thy mercifull Father, having ſo patiently for my ſins ſuffered puniſhment in this wretched place: And ſeeing he hath reputed my body unworthy of longer being in this life, be thou my gracious mediator for my ſoul, that in his judgement it be not baniſhed from eternal felicity promiſed to the good.</p>
               <p>This prayer having ſtopt the paſſage of <hi>Palmendos</hi> ſpeech, <hi>Ozalio</hi> uſed theſe words to the King. My Lord, be not diſmayed, we come not hither to offer you any outrage, but to deliver you from this thraldom, and carry you with us to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where you ſhall find your Queen and fair daughter <hi>Francelina,</hi> by whoſe means your troubles have now taken end, and there they ſtay onely for your comming.</p>
               <p>Afterward he declared the whole ſucceſs of the action; and breaking the bars of the little wicket, took him forth of that dark priſon wherin he had remained twenty years, ſuch marvellous hatred did the great Turk bear him. Yet could he not be certainly reſolved of his liberty, till he ſaw the Captain and the reſt that were ſlain, when em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Knights, he thanked God and them for his happy deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmendos</hi> thought it neceſſary to make no longer ſtay there, wherfore commanding one of their Squires to fetch a good horſe out of the Captains ſtable, they cauſed the

ſword, lay as quiet in his arms, as fair <hi>Daphne</hi> did with <hi>Phoebus,</hi> when <hi>Jupiter</hi> converted her into a Bay-trée. Wrapping her coſtly mantle about her, he departed ſafely from the guard, and coming where <hi>Oricano</hi> ſtaied with his horſe, made ſuch ſhift as he mounted into the ſaddle, and ſo gallopped to the reſt of his company, who marvelled not a little that he had got ſo good a booty.</p>
               <p>Great haſt they made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till they got on ſhipboard when <hi>Palmendos</hi> laying her upon his bed, and uſing her reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, becauſe ſhe was of ſuch honour, he put up his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſword into the ſheath, when very ſoon after <hi>Marenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> awaked; and ſéeing her ſelf in the company of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, crying out with fear, ſhe ſaid.

Why Fortune haſt thou not yet afflicted me enough? are my ſtars grown into ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred toward me, as in my ſléep to ſéek my deſtruction? And what are you that have béen ſo bold as to take me out of my bed? this audacious behaviour will return you no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guerdon, then the very ſharpeſt death that can be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

               <p>Falſe and diſloyal Knight (quoth ſhe) how can I but receive ſhame and infamy by this treachery, having in ſuch ſort been taken from among my Guard? If I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſee the King my husband, it was only to content my

               <p>Then began <hi>Marencida</hi> to fear her hair, which ſéemed as the golden wier, and beat her fair hands ſo white as the Alabaſter, with out-cries as a Woman deprived of her ſences: when the Prince pittying theſe feminine impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, drew his ſword, and to eaſe theſe extreams charmed her a ſléep again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> During this time, <hi>Ozalio</hi> had told the King of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> the whole news of his daugh-<hi>Francelina,</hi> whereto he gave good attention, becauſe ſince the time of his impriſonment, he had not heard any thing as concerning the affairs of his Realm, or that the Quéen his wife had any ſuch daughter, wherefore the tears trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down his face, he came and imbraced <hi>Palmendos,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, In ſooth my ſon, all the grievous torments I have heretofore indured, ſéem nothing in reſpect of the comfort I now feel, that my unknown child ſhall injoy a man ſo vertuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for this Ladies taking I am likewiſe glad, becauſe by this mean I ſhall be ſufficiently revenged on the Turk.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52643:92"/>
ſhe ſtill continued her former acclamations, not unlike <hi>Ariadne</hi> at the comming of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> when ſhe was found forſaken by <hi>Theſeus</hi> at the ſea-ſide: in like ſort did ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue her maledictions, invocating on <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Thetis,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Tritons,</hi> their Heralds, Monſters, Nimphs, and Sirens, that ſhe might ſuffer ſhipwrack in the ſea, and the fiſhes feed on her unhappy carcaſſe. But <hi>Ozalio</hi> pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her dolorous complaints, and finding his heart ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what eſprized with her love, intreated <hi>Palmendos</hi> to grant him one requeſt, which above all things elſe he required at his hands, when the Prince yeelding unto any thing his couſin would demand, <hi>Ozalio</hi> proceeded in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>My ſute is (worthy Lord and couſin) to enjoy this Lady as my Wife, to whom I know the deſtinies have fatally reſerved me, conſidering the ſudden change, and inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable controverſie my heart indureth: whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual accompanying of beautiful Ladies heretofore, could never move my frozen affections, and now I féel them not warm but boiling. Eaſily may you (quoth <hi>Palmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi>) obtain this demand of me, if nothing elſe ſtand in the way to hinder it, and as much do I deſire your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, as any way I can be covetous of mine own, hoping while I live to ſée no divorce betwéen us, but that our eſtates ſhall continue equally together, and in witneſs of my word, I deliver you the charge of this Princeſſe, hereafter to diſpoſe of her according to your deſires. <hi>Ozalio</hi> now uſes all decent courteſies to <hi>Marencida,</hi> thereby to gain favour in her conceit: yet all was in vain, for ſhe would not afford him any good countenance, but remain in her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted obſtinacy.</p>
               <p>When the poor fiſherman underſtood by his ſon <hi>Orica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> how his gueſts had delivered the King of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> out of <hi>Albayzo</hi> caſtle, he thought it no longer tarrying for him in Turky, wherefore he came and intreated the Prince <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendos,</hi> that he might ſail with him into Chriſtendom,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52643:93"/>
which ſuit was very ſoon obtained; ſo he, his wife and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily came all aboard the ſhip, the Prince promiſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their gentleneſs liberally.</p>
               <p>Now let us come to the Guard, and them that attended on <hi>Marencida,</hi> who waking, and not finding their Lady in her bed, began to chafe and rage in moſt extream manner; ſome rending their hair and beards violently, others run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mad among the Trees, thinking ſhe had been meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed in the Garden; nor could they imagine how to eſcape the danger, when the great Turk ſhould hear of this miſhap. Theſe comfortleſs creatures thus amazed, not any one of them daring to go tell the Emperour hereof, they determined to fly the Country, and return no more to the Court, leaving <hi>Marencidaes</hi> Ladies and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men mourning in that unhappy place, where (about noon) <hi>Ripole</hi> brother to <hi>Iffida</hi> arrived, returning from the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with his wife and divers brave Knights: but when he underſtood the cauſe of their ſorrow, he was ſtricken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a quandary, as he would paſs no further before he enquired more of this event. In the mean while he ſent a Squire to <hi>Albayzo</hi> Caſtle, to advertiſe his father of his comming; and the Squire prauncing up to the Fortreſs, marvelled to ſee the gates wide open, but much more when he ſaw the ſlaughter of the Knights, and the Captain himſelf lie ſlain among them: now was he ſurprized with ſuch fear, as he had not the heart to tarry there any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but truſting to the ſpeedy ſuccour of his horſe legs, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopped with all ſpeed to his Maſter; where ſtanding a while, as a man beſide himſelf, at length he thus ſpake.</p>
               <p>Pardon me (my Lord) in declaring a bloudy and tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal report, your worthy father, and all the guard of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, lie cruelly murthered in the baſe Court; and becauſe I found the great gates open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doubt the treaſure and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Caſtle hath occaſioned this maſſacre by ſome robbers and thieves. <hi>Ripole</hi> hearing theſe unlooked for news, was terrified in ſuch ſort as he could not tell what
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52643:93"/>
to ſay, but mounting on a luſty courſer, he rode to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, the Gentlemen bringing his wife fair and ſoftly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But when he beheld this wofull ſpectacle, and what a butchery <hi>Palmendos</hi> ſword had made, his ſervants feared he would have followed in this hard fortune. Nor can I here ſet down the rufull mones which <hi>Ripole</hi> made over his father, mother and ſiſter; no doubt they were as ſtrange and irkſome as this accident: but when they had ſearched through the Caſtle, and found nothing wanting but the King of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> they judged the authors of this tyranny to be Chriſtians, and that they likewiſe had carried away the Quéen <hi>Marencida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had taken order for interring the dead, he rode immediately toward the great Turk, having heard of <hi>Iffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daes</hi> Nurſe, all that had hapned betwéen her and the two Knights; and being come before the Emperour he fell at his feet, delivering the ſigns of an afflicted ſpirit, which onely ſought for grace and mercy. At length he declared the ſubſtance of this wreakfull occurrence, as well that of <hi>Marencida</hi> his Majeſties daughter, as the other of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death and deliverance of the King of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his ſiſter <hi>Iffida</hi> to be the onely cauſe thereof, and by what trains ſhe had been beguiled, himſelf being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innocent of the treaſon: notwithſtanding, he fréely offered himſelf at his gracious diſpoſition, to abide what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he would aſſign him. Theſe words ſo wounded the Turk to the heart, as he remained ſilent a great while, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger having ſo locked up the paſſage of his ſpéech: yet furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly at length ſtarting from his Chair, he railed on the Gods, ſtars, devils, and all the infernal powers. Ah <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> (quoth he) doubtleſs thou art angry with me, or elſe doſt take but litle care of thy ſervants, that evermore have extolled thee above all other Gods and Prophets: but much I wonder thou wouldſt thus forget me, unleſs thou wilt have me think thée extreamly offended, or that the hope is vain and fruſtrate which is repoſed in thée: You

               <p>Dread Lord, I am the ſervant and friend to the noble <hi>Palmendos,</hi> whoſe renown hath heretofore been blazed in this Court, and he humbly intreateth your Highneſs by me that you would entertain the King of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> whom he hath brought from <hi>Turkie,</hi> with ſuch grace and honour as beſeemeth his dignity: By this time I think they are entred the haven, in that they were not far off when I left them, I being ſent before to acquaint your Majecty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.

Behold my good Lord, your Queen and daughter, who are joyfully come to ſalute your arrival.

I pray you reſolve me preſently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in longer ſuſpence, in that your deformed eſtate hath greatly perplexed my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Madam (anſwered the King) it is no marvel though you know me not, conſidering the long time ſince you ſaw me laſt, which the integrity of our love hath made us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of greater compaſs, although the accuſtomed revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of years, do not diminiſh or increaſe one moment in their natural courſe: notwithſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am the ſame King your husband, who have felt more paſſions for your abſence, then anguiſh or torment in my miſerable captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But ſéeing the immortal bounty hath ſuffered me once again to ſée you, before my ſoul forſake this paſſible body, which was my continual deſire during my tribulation: now care I not though Death preſently do his duty; for ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circle of your arms have embraced me, I am the readier for my mother Earth to receive me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:52643:95"/>Now are joyfull tears plentifully poured forth on all ſides, and embracings ſo vehement, as though they ſhould never unfold again, the liberty of ſpéech being hindred all this while; for <hi>Palmendos</hi> and <hi>Francelina</hi> were tranſported into a ſecond heaven, where the outward ceremony ſerved to confirm the inward contentation, at length the Quéen taking <hi>Francelina</hi> by the hand thus ſpake to the King. Sée here (my Lord) your daughter, of whom I was but newly conceived when you went from <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> happy and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate may ſhe juſtly be tearmed, in that her deſtiny hath delivered you from priſon, reſtored me my former joy and given her the moſt perfect Knight that ever bare Arms.</p>
               <p>When the King beheld his daughter ſo fair and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he took her in his arms, expreſſing with ſilent favours his hearty joy: and in this while the Emperor came with his train, alighting from his horſe to welcome the King of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> whom when he beheld ſo ſpent and diſ-figured, the tears fel from his eys, and imbracing him in his arms, ſaid.</p>
               <p>My noble brother, heaven have the honour for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you from our common enemy; where albeit heretofore I was glad of your reſcue, yet was I agrieved at your impriſonment, being then my ſelf (as you know) in the Turks power, although he gave me more liberty then you, in hope I would have aided him with my uttermoſt ability: My deſire then to get from his ſervice, conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to deal ſomewhat hardly againſt you, an errour too notable, and I confeſs worthy reprehenſion: but God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the offences of the repentant hath in pitty regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us both, and by his inexpuiſable goodneſs, directed all things to a happy end.</p>
               <p>My Lord (replyed the King) the whole diſcourſe thereof have I heard by <hi>Palmendos,</hi> which gives me reaſon not to think any fault in you, when you could not otherwiſe help the ſame: But let us leave occaſions paſt, ſéeing heaven hath ſo miraculouſly delivered me, that I ſhould come
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52643:96"/>
my ſelf to preſent the entire affection wherewith I am bound to your Highneſs ſervice. Nor could any thing in the world (ſaid the Emperor) more delight me, then your comming with the Knight I have ſo long deſired to ſee; with whom I cannot but be offended (theſe words he mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily uttered) in that he hath tarried ſo long time from me. Then <hi>Palmendos</hi> falling on his knee, modeſtly anſwered in this manner. Dread Lord, if heretofore I have provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked your diſpleaſure, I confeſs ſuch puniſhment is due to me as you ſhall ordain, and willingly will I endure it, to faſhion me the better to your ſervice wherein I would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my ſelf according to your appointment, although it were to ſight againſt the gates of Death; whereof I gladly could afford ſome proof, ſo pleaſe your Highneſs to enjoyn me ſuch a task, as may expreſs my zeal and forwardneſs. And that you may know the name of your voluntary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, I am that <hi>Palmendos,</hi> who was ſince the hour of my birth deſtinied to follow your vertues, humbly intreating to diſcharge your remembrance of any diſcontentment I have heretofore occaſioned, in that mine own mind ſtill perſwaded me, I wanted worthineſs to come before your Excellency.</p>
               <p>The Emperor beholding him of ſuch gallant ſtature, did not a little marvel at his rare perfections, wherfore taking him graciouſly in his arms, deſired he would command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing wherein he might ſtand him in ſtead, for he was not able to requite his high deſervings. Afterward came <hi>Primaleon,</hi> and courteouſly entertained him; the like did <hi>Abenunco,</hi> ſignifying how much he was bound to him for his happy deliverance: then came <hi>Arnedes</hi> with the other Lords and Knights, all of them embracing the hardy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion that went away with the honour of the Tourney.</p>
               <p>By this time had <hi>Ozalio</hi> brought <hi>Marencida</hi> on ſhore, ſhe wondring to behold ſuch ſtate and royalty, wherefore ſhe deſired to know the place of her landing. Madam (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Ozalio</hi>) this City is called <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

this flouriſhing troop of Princes, who have vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed their comming hither to this Port, there may you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the famous Emperor <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who is here in perſon to receive the King of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and the worthy Knight that delivered him from priſon: your ſelf likewiſe will eſteem him a vertuous Prince, by the good entertainment you ſhal enjoy, when once he underſtandeth your ſtate and calling; ſo that I hope you will not repent this voyage, were it but to have knowledge of him alone.</p>
               <p>How miſerable and unfortunate am I (quoth ſhe) to fal into the mercy of my fathers capital enemy? how can my griefs but grow into an exceeding ſurpluſage? If I ſee the King <hi>Occurites</hi> my husband the meeting will be with marvellous heart-break on either ſide, being both of us captive to the very worſt enemy we have. The Emperor and his Lords kindly ſaluted her, but ſhe would not once bow her ſelf, or make any anſwer, whereat the ſtanders by very much wondred, tearming her a woman of rough and unſeemly behaviour, ſaying, nature might much better have made her a man. Mounting all on horſeback, in moſt comely order they rode to the Pallace, where the Empreſs and her Ladies met them in the Court. To tell the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies, gratulations and welcome there uſed would ask a world of time, yet but little to the purpoſe: let it ſuffice then, they are ſo well entertained as you can any way ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmendos</hi> taking <hi>Marencida</hi> by the hand, brought her to the Princeſs <hi>Philocriſta</hi> with theſe ſpeeches. I deſire you Madam to accept this Lady into your company, and give her ſuch good counſel as you can beſt deviſe, for ſhe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of royal bloud I aſſure you. Sir <hi>Palmendos</hi> (repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Princeſs) I muſt obey what you command me, for the love I bear to you and your ſweet friend: and I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine my ſelf fortunate, having ſuch a precious gage from a Knight ſo perfect; nor ſhall ſhe be worſe intreated then mine own ſelf.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Marencida</hi> hearing theſe gracious ſpéeches, and what courteſie <hi>Palmendos</hi> uſed to the Princeſſe, perceived that ſhe was the Emperours daughter, wherefore ſhe gave her many thanks, ſhewing better countenance then before ſhe did to any: which <hi>Philocriſta</hi> took very kindly, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the ſteps with her into the Hall, ſhe came to <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celina</hi> with theſe words. This Lady, (Madam) doth now ſupply your place, ſéeing Lord <hi>Palmendos</hi> is returned, for now your company with me muſt diſcontinue becauſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and your fatal love doth ſo command me, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I hope our amity ſhall continue.</p>
               <p>Fair Princeſſe (anſwered <hi>Francelina</hi>) we are both ſo far yours, and ſo good part have you in my Lord, as you ſhall find your ſelf no leſſe contented then abaſhed when you know all: therefore fear not that I will forget your friendly familiarity, rather will I continue your loving ſiſter, as our further aſſurance of our mutuall agreement. Sundry other ſpéeches paſſed betwéen the two young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in mean while <hi>Marencida</hi> looking about her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the great pomp, ſtate and riches of her father, ſhe made but ſlender account of the Emperours Court, which was not at this time ſo well ſtored with Knights as it was wont to be, whereupon ſhe giving a great ſigh, thus uttered her mind.</p>
               <p>You know, Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that the ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous royalty of my fathers Court, doth exceed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Princes in the whole world, as alſo how many migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lords ſerve him with homage and fealty, becauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore you have ſeen the ſame; where if you were ſo adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous and hardy, as to kill without fear of them (as the whole world knoweth) the mighty Emperor mine Vncle, think, I pray you, what miſerable caſe the Lady is in, ſo trayterouſly brought from her own Country, and now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered captive into your cuſtody, wherein me thinks, in reſpect of the renown ſpread abroad of you, you ſhould take example by my adverſity, and rather grieve then glory
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52643:97"/>
therein, as I ſée you do, conſidering that inconſtant For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is ſtill variable, and doth not always allow men feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. This I ſpeak not, whereby to gain the more favour or honour in your Court, becauſe death would be much more welcome to me, then to live in the vexation of mind I do: wherefore I intreat you again (if intreaty may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeem an adverſary) hereafter to conſerve your reputation in ſuch ſort, as I may receive no impeach to mine honor, and you ſhall comfort me better therein, then all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of your fame can do.</p>
               <p>To theſe words ſhe added many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I underſtand, Madam full well what you have ſaid, and know beſide, that the feminine choler which governeth your ſpirit, maketh you uſe ſuch kind of language, as is clean exempt from all the rules of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly modeſty: nor am I now to learn, that the ſtrength of earthly Kings and Potentates is leſs then nothing, when God is bent repugnant againſt them, whereby we are all to reſolve that we can do no good act without his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
               <p>According to his direction came I unto your Vncles Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before whom I proteſt, and crave no mercy in the day of vengeance, if I ſlew him, or ever thought to do it, being too far carried away from minding any ſuch intent, by the honor I had before received at his Highneſs hands. Yet was I privie to his forcible detaining of the Lady, and laboured to reſtore her to her Lord and husband, ſhe being daughter to the renowned King of <hi>England,</hi> and wife to the now famous Emperor <hi>Trincus</hi> of <hi>Almain</hi>: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (me thinks) I committed no offence, he kéeping her moſt unjuſtly profaning thereby the ſacred Laws of royal equity.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the wiſe have evermore patiently endured their fortune, being either good or bad, I verily perſwade my ſelf, Madam, that you will forbear to complain and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52643:98"/>
lament in this unſéemly manner, knowing your ſelf to be conquered by the moſt courteous and debonair Knight that this day liveth in <hi>Europe,</hi> even he that in Helleſpont overcame the King <hi>Ocurites</hi> your husband.</p>
               <p>Theſe news ſo grieved <hi>Marencida</hi> to the heart, when ſhe heard the Emperor ſay, that the King her husband and ſhe her ſelf were both taken captive by one Knight, as fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick-like ſhe could have eaten her fleſh with anger: but the young Princeſs <hi>Philocriſta</hi> conducting her to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, appeaſed her fury with divers friendly ſpéeches and courteous behaviour. But let us now return again to the Prince <hi>Palmendos,</hi> who in this time unarmed himſelf, that the Emperor might at more pleaſure behold him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXI. What courteous conference <hi>Palmendos</hi> had with the Emperour, the Empreſs, and <hi>Primaleon:</hi> And how being afterwards baptized, he was affianced to his Lady.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that <hi>Palmendos</hi> had put off his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, he threw a rich Turkiſh robe about him embroidered all over with Oriental Pearls, which he brought from <hi>Tharſus</hi> with him, according to the modern cuſtome uſed among the moſt magnificent Kings of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to wear it when he ſhould come into the Emperours preſence. Being returned into the great Hal and each one covetous to underſtand his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, <hi>Primaleon</hi> took him by the hand, and ſate down, when the Emperour began in this manner. My noble friend <hi>Palmendos,</hi> longer muſt you not conceal your ſelf, your renown being ſo laviſhly bruited through all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys:

tell me then, I pray you, of what parents you are iſſued, as alſo what you think elſe convenient to acquaint us withal.</p>
               <p>Gracious Lord (anſwered <hi>Palmendos</hi>) with you whom I ſo reverence by honour, I may not diſſemble in any point, for that I were unworthy your preſence if I ſhould deal double with ſo great a ſtate. Know then mighty Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, that I am ſon to the Quéen of <hi>Tharſus,</hi> the affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſervant and vowed friend to your Majeſty, forſaking my Country by a ſtrange occaſion, ſo ſoon as I underſtood where my father remained, which long before was concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from me. The cauſe of my comming into your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Court, was the fame and praiſes I heard of <hi>Franceli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> to whoſe ſervice the fatal deſtinies enjoyned me at my very eſſence, in that I never affected any other Lady, yet reputing my ſelf unworthy of her grace and favour, or to be ſeen in this honourable Court. To this he added the diſcouſe of the old woman that appeared unto him in the Pallace at <hi>Tharſus,</hi> and how ſhe blamed him for his idle and ſlothfull life; yet hiding how ſhe aſſured him to be his ſon becauſe further opinion ſhould paſs till that were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.

               <p>When the Emperour heard theſe things, he preſently judged <hi>Palmendos</hi> to be his ſon, by the ſudden and ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſupputation he made of his age, and of the time he was in <hi>Paſmeria</hi> where the Queen his mother came ſo ſubtilly acquainted with him. Baſhfull hereof he was, when he looked on the Empreſs, as his vermilion colour plainly diſcovered, yet did he diſcreetly ſhadow the ſame: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Empreſs miſdoubted ſomewhat, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring her dream of the Queen of <hi>Tharſus,</hi> and what the Emperour himſelf had told her before; yet made ſhe no
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52643:99"/>

               <p>In ſooth my eſpecial good friend <hi>Palmendos,</hi> I now love and eſteem you much better then before, underſtanding that you are ſon to the Queen of <hi>Tharſus,</hi> who did me ſo great honour in her Countreys; her very name maketh me to remember my travels in thoſe parts: So that I know not how to expreſs my joy, hearing your ſelf ſo well reſolved, to forſake the Ethnick paganiſm of your blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Gods. Wherefore I am thus adviſed, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſo good an occaſion, but to morrow you ſhall receive the holy character of Chriſtianity, and be likewiſe affian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to your Lady <hi>Francelina</hi>: for reaſon required herein to haſten your right, ſeeing for her you have endured ſuch dangerous travels, and forſaken a Realm of ſo great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate the riches and fertility whereof I am well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withal.</p>

               <p>In reſpect, my good Lord, (anſwered <hi>Palmendos</hi>) that truth muſt and wil come forth at length, know then migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prince and my gracious father, that in the Realm of <hi>Paſmeria,</hi> you begat me your ſon, the night before you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Quéen my mother; for ſhe being adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of your rare perfections, became impatient in her amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

affections, and compoſed the mean of your acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by a charmed drink provided for that purpoſe. And here behold the effect of this action, my ſelf your humble ſon and obedient ſervant, yet did my mother give me a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimony hereof, having her ſelf given you the like at her departure: but <hi>Francelina</hi> hath the ſame now in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion for to her I gave it after her deliverance: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore ſhe concealed this matter from me, till miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly I was informed both thereof &amp; as concerning <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celina,</hi> becauſe ſhe feared I would forſake my country, to come and ſerve in your highneſſe Court. As concerning my behaviour ſince that time, ſomewhat I am ſure hath happened to your hearing, yet of ſuch ſmall and ſlender value, as they neither beſeemed this place, or your perſon. The Emperor raviſhed with conceit of this report, knew not which way beſt to ſignifie his joy, for conſidering the ſtrange courſe of the action paſt, &amp; what the ſucceſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of now proved, his ſpirits were carried away with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imaginations.</p>
               <p>Ah my noble ſon <hi>Palmendos</hi> (quoth he) full well am I aſſured of what thou haſt ſaid although nature hath ſhaped thee not much unlike me, and given thee ſuch heroical courage as I had in my younger daies; and albeit the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe may wel be offended with me, when ſhe ſhall be thus thorowly reſolved, yet is her wiſedom and modeſty ſuch, as ſhe will not miſlike what I allow. With theſe words the Emperour took him by the hand, going with him immediately to the Empreſſe Chamber, and after his Majeſty had kindly kiſſed her, he entred into theſe ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>I know wel Madam, that heretofore you have held good opinion of my loyalty, and that I ever loved you intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as your ſelf could deſire no better proof thereof: but the cauſe why I uſe theſe words at this inſtant, is a little ſcruple that long ſince entred my mind, and I fear will offend you when the ſame is known. Yet leaſt further

doubts ſhould trouble your thoughts, I proteſt before him who is the onely ſearcher of hearts, and I ſwear by all the divine aſſiſtants about his tribunal, that never with my will and knowledge did I contaminate our wedlock-bed, much leſſe have I infringed the laws of marriage, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the inviolable faith I ſolemnly gave you.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding ſuch hath been my former fortune, that another woman beſide your ſelf, by charms obtained what was your right, then muſt you not (Madam) be ſo ſevere and rigorous, as not to pardon me, ſeeing I have voluntarily confeſſed my offence, beſide, the fault not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from me delivers my cauſe to be more innocent.</p>

As for <hi>Palmendos,</hi> he ſhall now accept me as his mother, and I wil love him no leſs then my own ſon <hi>Primaleon</hi>; with ſundry other ſpeeches were theſe joies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and <hi>Palmendos</hi> right lovingly imbraced by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, at length <hi>Primaleon</hi> came, and he being throughly acquainted with the matter, took the Prince in his arms, thus ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>Hath the mighty governour of the heavens appointed, that the onely flower of chivalry ſhould be my brother? wherein can I more honour that ſuperexcelling bounty, then confirming my thanks to him by kindneſſe to the worthy copartner of my vital bloud, drawn from the ſelf-ſame ſource where I received my original?
