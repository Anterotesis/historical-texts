         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSVVER WITHOUT A QUESTION: OR, The Late <hi>Schiſmatical Petition</hi> Expounded.</head>
            <p>WHen I firſt lookt upon the ſimply prophane Title of that impious <hi>Petition</hi> which the two-horn'd Beaſt preſented to the ſeven-headed Monſter at Weſtminſter, I could do no leſs then deride their ſimplicity, and condemn their inſufferable Demand for a Diabolical TOLERATION: Certainly it was penned by that Pragmatical fellow, Colonel PRIDE the Devils Secretary, who being diſerted by the other ſix deadly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109111:3"/>ſins (who are gone with <hi>Cromwel</hi>) in a Melancholy, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Cholerick rather then a ſuſpicious Humour, wrote this preſumptious and damnable Command, diſguiſing it with the Hackney Roabes of a PETITION, and leading <hi>TOM</hi> indifferent by the Noſe, let him ſee it through his fingers, who, poor fool (being uſed to it) according to his breeding, Signed it: But to ſpeak truth, FAIRFAX that neceſſary evil was a fool, and PRIDE that nominal and natural Devil, proved himſelf a Knave: the one for not looking on it but with another mans Spectacles; the other for Cheating him and the world by his Hypocritically humble PETITION, and pretended Spirit of Faith and Supplication: But he doth not only ſeek to Cheat men, but to mock God, he would put a trick upon his Divine Majeſty, by fathering that upon him, which he never intended, as <hi>that the Victory (if they had one) was given by God to them in</hi> Ireland, as <hi>The fruit of that Faith &amp; Supplication which God hath powred forth on the hearts of the people, to the bringing down the common Enemy, &amp;c.</hi> when it is evident, that whatever they have done ſince theſe Wars, hath proceeded from our ſins as the <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> and not from their Righteouſneſs: I confeſs they be Gods Servants, but no otherwiſe then <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was, to puniſh the Iſraelites, and then God will puniſh him: but how impudently they perſevere in their prophane expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! taking the Lords <hi>Name in vain, by diſſembling That they fight under his Banner, and that by the ſame power and preſence that hath made bare his Arm in the late Victory,</hi> wickedly intimating that God fought for them and their <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> at <hi>Dublin,</hi> they tender to this Conventicle their annexed Propoſals as full of Hereſie and Blaſphemy as this exordium is of Hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>Firſt they condemne thoſe which ſometimes they hold infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, of a Crime, in making Ordinances of Parliament (which indeed were the beſt that ever they made) whereby many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious people are much moleſted, &amp;c. meaning that by thoſe Ordinances Sectaries &amp; Hereticks, whom they term con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious people, were hindered from diſperſing their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Tenents: but ſee how they ſport with God, engaging him in every buſineſs, <hi>That the Spirit of Chriſt flowing forth in his Servants for the declaring his Name in the Nation, may not be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109111:3"/>ſuppreſſed, but receive all due encouragement:</hi> What fair pretences theſe Impoſtures have? ſuch as would deceive the very Elect if it were poſſible: but their Actions are ſo contrary to their expreſſions, that any one may perceive they make heaven their Pander, earth their Bawdy-houſe, and the Devil their Servant, who hath endeavoured ſuch a Toleration in many Kingdoms, but could never prevail till now he found how devoted the Whore of <hi>England</hi> was to him, he hath gotten what he lookt for, which makes him not doubt of good ſucceſs: for having once ſowed this ſeed, he ſhall ever after have a great Crop, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he is in hope that theſe his Servants by his help, may bring other Countries to it in a yeer or two, which he in almoſt two thouſand yeers could not do: But now to their ſecond Propoſal.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>And becauſe we are ſenſible, that through the ſubtilty of Sathan, &amp;c.</hi> Surely the Devil gave them leave to abuſe him, or elſe they durſt not be ſo diſ-obediently wicked as to ſpeak againſt their own Father: but if they diſpleaſe him in theſe, they pleaſe him in the following Lines: and make the worſt of it, they do but break his head, and preſently give him a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter far better then a Mountebancks Balſom, which comes in juſt as the Devil would have it, <hi>We therefore from our hearts do humbly declare, That it is not our meaning, that the Liberty before Deſired by us ſhould extend to the Toleration of Popery, Prelacy, the Book of Common-Prayer, &amp;c.</hi> This Reconciles the Devil unto them, for now he finds that all their intentions, words, and actions, tend to the exaltation of his Kingdom: for although Popery be excluded, yet he is fully Recompenced in the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of Prelacy and Uniformity: Beſides, one Hereſie is more profitable to him then a thouſand Papiſtical Fopperies: For he will ſuddenly bring in as many Hereſies as houſes, and as many Opinions as there be people: to adde to the number, he hath got leave, that a ſervant of his, a Saint of the laſt edition, ſhould tranſlate that Academy of Hereſies, the Turkiſh <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which in the dayes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charls</hi> of bleſſed Memory, was treaſon in any one to tranſport hither, much leſs Tranſlate: and that it might be more vendible and acceptable, all the groſs abſurdities are left out, as a learned and holy man of this Kingdom hath obſerved.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:109111:4"/>
            <p>The Turkiſh <hi>Alcaron</hi> ſaith he is abroad, but that the Reader may not be abuſed, let him know, That all the moſt groſs, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, ridiculous Blaſphemies, and impoſſible Fictions which were wont to make that wicked volumn juſtly odious to the world, are left out in the Engliſh Tranſlation; for my part I know not how to Conſtrue it, but as done in too much favour to the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> miſ-religion: the pretence of the Error muſt be this, The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlator follows the Verſion of a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> too much it ſeems Intereſted in the Turkiſh Court, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employed from the French King as his Agent at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> was likewiſe re-employed by the <hi>Turk</hi> into France, and taking upon him to Tranſlate this Worthy <hi>Work</hi> as he calls it, out of the <hi>Arabick,</hi> thought fit (for what ends he knew beſt) to take the beſt, and leave the worſt: Know this Reader, and reſolve that thou canſt not enough hate that <hi>pack</hi> of <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Fopperies, which chiefly aime at the diſparagement of thy Saviour, and the de-crying of the bleſſed Trinity.</p>
            <p>Thus far the Obſervator gives his Cenſure of the <hi>Alcaron:</hi> Now I will leave this to the impartial Reader to judge what a Medly of Religions we ſhall have; <hi>Amſterdam</hi> muſt be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to us, as we have been formerly to them, for new Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: we ſhall be as much cryed up for Rarieties of Religion, as the French-men for Faſhions; as for the Socinians, Niſtorians, Arrians, &amp;c. they will look like old faſhion Dublets: we muſt have the German Anabaptiſt, the Scottiſh Presbyter, and the Engliſh Independent, the Epitomy of Hereſie.</p>
            <p>But now they ſtop up this gappe of Iniquity with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſpriggs of Righteouſneſs: <hi>Viz. We further deſire, That through your Care and Zeal, all open Acts of Prophaneſs, as Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Swearing, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, &amp;c. be vigorouſly proceeded againſt and puniſht in all Perſons whatſoever.</hi> But this they do for their Profit and Recreation, and not out of any godly Principle, for by this, the encreaſe of the rich mens ſins will be the augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Saints wealth; and the miſdemeanours of the Poor, will be the Recreation of the rich; ſo that as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have proſpered by the Devils help, by their own wickedneſs, they ſhall hereafter grow rich by the ſins of the People.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:109111:4"/>
            <p>Now that they may ſeem to be as merciful as ſevere, they Deſire that which the other dare not Deny, and with their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed prophaneſs thus go on, <hi>That upon the ſence of this great Mercy lately received from God, your hearts will be moved to extend your favour ſo far as may ſtand with the ſafety of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, to thoſe who have formerly ſerved you, &amp;c.</hi> Still they reiterate <hi>Monkes</hi> Lie, the great Victory that the Annals of the Saints boaſts of in IRELAND, and therefore as a Manifeſtation of their joy, they ſhould ſet free the Spirit of Contradiction, <hi>Lilburn</hi> and his baſtards the Levellers, which I wiſh they may do, that thoſe Firebrands may burn up all the Blocks and Loggerheads of the Three Kingdoms: But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve fooliſh <hi>Jack Preſbyter</hi> may wait long enough for this day of Deliverance; for they mean (by <hi>thoſe that have formerly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them</hi>) none but the generation of Vipers the Levellers: but theſe drops of Mercy end in a ſhowre of Cruelty, for after they have pleaded for their Brethren in Iniquity, they furiouſly Demand, <hi>That for the future, all Diſturbers of the Publick Peace be vigorouſly proceeded againſt:</hi> This thundering ſentence is like a <hi>Pedagogues</hi> menaces, you ſhall be whipt if you do ſo any more: But I dare ſwear, if <hi>Jack Lilburn</hi> and his Confederates once get looſe, they will not fear to play Truant, and perhaps before Chriſtmas wil ſhut their Maſters out of the School, and vigorouſly proceed againſt them, as the Diſturbers of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace: but now (that they may be the better thought of by the Communalty) they like <hi>Publick Perſons</hi> Deſire, <hi>That ſpeedy Conſiderations may be had of thoſe great Oppreſſions which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Nation groan under by reaſon of the Multiplicity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Laws, &amp;c.</hi> This were a good Requeſt if Cordial, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if they would ſtand to the performance of it: For firſt, All thoſe unneceſſary waſte Papers, Acts and Ordinances made by this Heretical Parliament, ſhould be Re-called, and then theſe Catterpillers of the Kingdom (which be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Oppreſſors that ever people groaned under) ſhould be taken away.</p>
            <p>But now I come to the <hi>Junctoes</hi> Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Officers after the reading of the ſame, were called in, and

            </p>
            <p>They durſt not do otherwiſe: Ile undertake if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded five of the moſt innocent in the Houſe to be delivered to them to ſuffer Condign puniſhment, they ſhould have them with all their hearts; and therefore in ſuch a thing as this is, they muſt needs conſent; for they would if they durſt, long before this, have Voted not only diverſity of Religions, but variety of Gods, and Plurality of Wives.</p>
