            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After these rose vp Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 22. of that name. But least any man distrust my words in this point, I will receite the words of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> who in his fourth booke of sentences, in the ende of a certaine question of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of confirmation, saith thus; last of all, it is reported of Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. that he publiquely taught, declared, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <note place="margin">The Pope comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his Vassals, to sweare to false doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</note> all men to held (this opinion) that the soules of the iust, haue not before the day of dome, the sole, which is the cleare and faciall sight of God. And it is said, that he induced the Vniuersity of <hi>Paris</hi> to this; that no man should take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the same, but, he that first did swear to desend this error, &amp; to mantain the


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1597:21"/>
same for euer. Thus saith <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was him selfe the Byshoppe or Pope of Rome, and the most excellently learned Byshoppe, that euer was in that sea. And it will not serue the turne to say as the Iesuite <hi>Bellermine</hi> doth, in the defense of popish faith: to wit, that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a priuate man, but not as Pope, for that distinction doth not onely want a good foundation, whereupon it should be built, but also it flatly destroyeth the plain text: the reason hereof is most euident, euen to euery childe. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">1</note> Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> saith, <hi>(docuit,)</hi> hee taught. Secondly, because he saith, <note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>(publice,)</hi> publiquelie. Thirdly, because <note place="margin">3</note> he saith, <hi>(mandauit,)</hi> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded all to holde it.

Fiftly, because euery gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <note place="margin">5</note> did swere, to hold &amp; defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it foreuer.
