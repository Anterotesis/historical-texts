            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following Sheets which I found written by my Dear Brother (now in Glory) with his own Hand, being dedicated by himſelf to you; I do accordingly, with much ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, humbly preſent then, to you. And tho they are but the rougher Draughts of what was intended by my Brother, (he having begun himſelf, and made ſome progreſs

            <p>The Advice which my Brother has left towards the Cloſe of his Life (Dear Siſter) had he lived to perfect what he had begun, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, would have been in every particular ſuted by himſelf to you, wherein it now differs from your Circumſtances; but my Brother not reaching ſo far with his own Pen, I thought it better to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it as it was, than in any thing material to alter or vary from the Original.</p>
            <p>And that this Book may reach the Hands of all Relations, for whom it was deſigned; and may be of uſe to others alſo, into whoſe

            <p>IF thou beeſt one acquainted indeed with Religion, and haſt ſo far approved of its Laws and Principles, as to give up thy ſelf to the ſtudy and practice thereof; thou doſt not need any one ſhould tell thee, that it is a ſerious, and deſerves to be a commanding Thing, and not to be played and trifled with: There is nothing in all the World to be compared with it, becauſe of its Excellency; nothing to be minded above it, or equally with it, becauſe of its Importance.</p>
            <p>But alas! alas! how little is there of pure and undefiled Religion upon Earth? In how few is it to be ſeen in its Power and Glory? A great number of Perſons have their Religion to chooſe, being altogether indifferent, rude Matter fit for any Form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ready to receive any Impreſſion; that ſhall be their Religion which is moſt eaſy, and gives the greateſt Latitude, and hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:100468:5"/>
Safety and temporal Advantages to commend it to them; but let the Pretences of theſe be what they will, for certain their Belly is their God.</p>
            <p>Others are to be found, who ſeem to have choſen and pitch'd upon their Religion, and that the true One; they have given up their Names to Chriſt, make profeſſion of him, wear his Livery; but they do ſo untowardly manage the matter, that Religion receives no Honour from them, nor are they like to reap any ſaving Benefit by it: And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this is one great reaſon why it gains ſo little in the World, why it ſtrikes no more awe upon By-ſtanders, why it gets no more Love and Reſpect, why it hath no more Followers, no more to embrace it; becauſe though abundance of People have their Tongues tipt with it, there is very little of it made viſible in their Lives; though they love now and then to talk of it, they do not care to be in all things govern'd by it; but inſtead of that, are its Reproach and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement, contradicting their Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, by an unſutable and unworthy Converſation; there is very little, if any thing at all, of the Power of Godlineſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering it ſelf in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:100468:5"/>In the Church and publick Aſſemblies, and during the time of Religious Worſhip, there you may poſſibly ſee in them ſomething of Solemnity, a ſerious Deportment, a compoſed Countenance, an attentive Ear; ſo that one who obſerves them, will be ready to conclude them really ſet for God, and greatly devoted to his Fear and Service. But when that Work is over, how much are they altered from what they ſeem to be? Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them in their Converſes with Men, their Diſcourſes at their Tables, their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in their Families; nay could you look into their Chambers and Cloſets, you would quickly find too much reaſon to fear that Religion and they are too great Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. O how common a thing is it to ſee in Men and Women, making a Profeſſion, ſhameful Neglects, frequent, if not conſtant Omiſſions of Duty, together with other great Miſcarriages, and unjuſtifiable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, notwithſtanding that glorious Light which hath ſhined among us, thoſe precious Ordinances which have been afforded to us, and are yet continued, notwithſtanding that Holy Communion which they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into; and thoſe repeated Obligations which have been laid upon them both by God and themſelves, beſides thoſe various and
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:100468:6"/>
Tremendous Judgments with which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but provoked, God hath followed us in theſe Nations, that by them he might humble us, and prove us, and make us better.</p>
            <p>The Strength and Spirits of too many are exhauſted, and ſpent upon matters of leſs worth and concernment, while the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Chriſtianity are miſerably forgotten and overlook'd. O that God would be graciouſly pleaſed to pour out more of his Spirit on thoſe who are called by his Name, that ſo the old Godlineſs might be reſtored and revived among us; and we may not only look forth as the Morning, and fair as the Moon that hath its Spots, but alſo as the Sun when he is at his Meridian, in his Brightneſs, and Height and Strength; And when once it comes to that, then will the Church be terrible as an Army with Ranners.</p>
            <p>Our Gracious God hath of late been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in his own Strength, and triumphed gloriouſly; He hath done great Things for us, of which we are glad: O that we would put on all the Strength we have, and put it forth, and go to God for more, and be exalted in our Deſires, and Zeal, and Endeavours, and do to our utmoſt for God.
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:100468:6"/>
O that all thoſe who name the Name of Chriſt, would part from Iniquity, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſtand compleat in the Will of God, filling up their Days, and Places, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations with Duty, and leading ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable and exemplary Lives as may condemn the wicked World, and be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of God, and ſhew forth the Vertues of him that hath called them out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into his marvellous Light. O that I could ſee the Church, the Lamb's Wife, in her Bravery, in her Garments of wrought Gold, as a Bride made ready for her Husband; and ſo the Beauty of the Lord our God upon all thoſe who own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves his Children, begotten to him by the Goſpel.</p>

by them: for he was rich toward God, rich in Faith and good Works.</p>
            <p>After many Troubles which he met with, divers toſſes and tumblings which diſturbed that ſweet Repoſe he otherwiſe would gladly have taken, he did by the good Hand of God upon him fix in this City, where he had a comfortable enjoyment of himſelf, ſitting with great delight under the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Shadow of his deareſt Lord, in the moſt precious Ordinances of the Goſpel. It pleaſed God after a conſiderable time, to direct and incline his Heart to join himſelf to that Flock of Chriſt, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made me Overſeer: In which he was very eminent for his conſtant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and ſerious Attention, and great Affection. He took the Sermons deliver'd, <hi>verbatim,</hi> read them to his Wife and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily when he came home; and ſeveral of them he wrote out in a very fair Hand, that he might leave them behind him for the benefit of others.</p>
            <p>He was an humble and holy Chriſtian, no Buſy-body, not captious nor quarrelſom, a Companion of all thoſe that feared God, for in them was all his Delight, as the Excellent Ones of the Earth: Moſt willing to condeſcend to, and be familiar with
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:100468:7"/>
Perſons of low Degree; not valuing any ſo much by what they had of the World, as by the Relation in which they ſtood to Chriſt, and by the Spirit, Grace and Diſpoſition of Chriſt, which diſcover'd it ſelf in them. He was no Faſhion-monger, Genteel, but not Gaudy, Neat, but Modeſt and Sober; ſo adorning himſelf as that he might adorn the Doctrine of his God and Saviour, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Chriſt, and Mercy, and Bowels, and over all Humility; that was the upper Garment through which the reſt were ſeen, being immovably reſolved to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. He bid Evil-doers depart from him, and was a Companion of them that would walk with him in the Way everlaſting: They and none but they were the Men of his Choice. When our publick Liberty was by our good God graciouſly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, after very long and furious Storms had been upon us, he ſoon made choice of me for his Paſtor; and that Flock of Chriſt which I am appointed to water, and lead into green Paſtures, and by the ſtill Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; he did, as I ſaid before, chooſe to walk in a Holy Communion with: And with them he continued, until the Great God, in whoſe Hand our Times are, was pleaſed to remove him to the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:100468:8"/>
in Heaven. During all that Time, he was very exemplary to others, and no leſs pleaſant to me.</p>
            <p>I being deſired one Day to preach the Morning-Lecture in <hi>Southwark,</hi> he would needs accompany me. We together croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Water, and either going or return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he got Cold, which was obſtinate, and kindled in him a Feaver, and that Feaver conſumed him; his little Oil ſpent aſpace, and the Lamp of his precious and much deſired Life, was ſoon extinguiſhed. But O, how did he ſhine and glorify God in that Fire! How ſweetly did he carry toward him, without any Quarrelling, or the leaſt ſpice of Diſcontent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I heard not the leaſt word that ſpake a Diſlike of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; No, no, his Spirit was, as it ought to be, ſubmitted to the Divine Will, and he at God's diſpoſal, ready to die: for Preparation had been his Work, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die, for that would be his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. His ſubmiſſive Reſignation to the Holy Will of God herein, ſee in the Record he left in his Diary in the beginning of his Sickneſs, thus; <q>
                  <hi>March 10,</hi> Through Mercy, this Day much better with me than my Deſert, tho I find my ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what indiſpos'd by Cold, full of Aches
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:100468:8"/>
and Pains, and Chillineſs, and ſore Eyes; the Lord, if it be his Will, heal me this Night, or grant a Preparedneſs for his Pleaſure, and that as the outward Man decays, the inward Man may be renewed day by day: The Lord pardon my Sin, and accept of Praiſe for all Mercies.</q> And the Night following, (which was the laſt he writ in his Diary) he recorded it thus; <q>
                  <hi>March 21.</hi> This Day ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper ſeems to hang upon me, thô not worſe (bleſſed be God) than laſt Night; The Lord in Mercy heal me, and recover me, or fit me for thy Pleaſure: The good Lord fit me for the approaching Sabbath, and make it a good Day to my Soul for Chriſt's Sake. Pardon my Sin, and take Praiſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And God was exceeding gracious to him, for he chained up Satan ſo that he could not throw one fiery Dart at him; and he enabled Conſcience to bear its Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to his filial State, and having led his Converſation in the World in Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God; and alſo he lifted upon him the Light of his Countenance, ſhed abroad his Love in his Heart by the Holy Ghoſt which had been
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:100468:9"/>
given him, and furniſhed him with ſuch an Anchor of Hope as was fixed within the Vail, and both ſure and ſtedfaſt. And all this being done for him, it was not in the power of the King of Terrors to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright him; but in his neareſt Approaches he could look him in the Face without any Diſcompoſure, and not only triumph over him as a baffled and conquer'd Enemy, whoſe Teeth were broken and Sting loſt, but likewiſe bid him welcome as a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſent by his Father to do him a real Kindneſs: And knowing whom he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, he could with Joy breath out his Laſt, and take his Flight to the unſeen World; where, as he was ſure, his deareſt Lord had taken up his own Reſt at the Right-hand of his Father, and there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a Place for him.</p>
            <p>That I may contract; After God had touch'd his Heart, He lived as one that knew he ſhould die, and he died as one that knew he ſhould live better than ever. He lived in Holineſs, and be died in Faith. His Ways were Righteous, and his End was Peace. Now he is gone to Reſt, and rejoice in that God whom he ſerved, and with whom he walked while he was here. What Earth hath parted with, Heaven
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:100468:9"/>
hath receiv'd: His Death was a Loſs to many, to me that was his Paſtor; for with him I ſometimes took ſweet Counſel, rejoicing in the Greatneſs of that Love and Zeal he had for God in his holy Diſcourſes, and Expreſſiveneſs of a Goſpel-Temper. A Loſs <hi>to the Church</hi> of which he was a Member; in which he was very lovely and acceptable for his Carriage under Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and Management of himſelf after them. A Loſs <hi>to the Poor,</hi> who found his Hand liberally, yet withal pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently open for their Relief. But above all, a Loſs <hi>to his dear Yoke-fellow,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed felt the Smart of the Blow, yet was dumb, and opened not her Mouth, becauſe the Lord had done it. And it highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes her, me, and us all, to be ſilent, and acquieſce in the Providence of that God, who being infinite in Wiſdom, doth all things well without Miſcarrying in a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.</p>

Cards and Dice, and worſe things too. O that ſuch as read it, would tread in his Steps, and by his Example learn to take care of their immortal Souls, and Pains about them; for their Intereſt is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and ſhould be moſt minded, and firſt ſecur'd. Wilt thou pleaſe to read it with Prayer, and an hearty Deſire of being the better for it, and then I do not queſtion but thou wilt be ſo. The Author's Will was, that it ſhould be communicated to his Relations; for he was an hearty Friend to their Souls: His affectionate and worthy Brother hath rather choſen this way of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it, that ſo the Benefit thereby might be more extenſive: And if their united Deſire and Deſign do take, there are Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds that will make their thankful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, and bleſs God. In it there are many things worthy of thy notice: It is before thee, and I ſhall leave them to thine own Obſervation; only a word or two.</p>
            <p>Here thou wilt ſee how much he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Sin, which is the baſeſt of Evils, and doth the greateſt Miſchief in the World. Here thou wilt ſee his ſecret and daily retiring into himſelf, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with his own Heart; though too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

are, yet he was not a Stranger at home. Thou maiſt ſee the conſtant Watch he kept, as knowing how many Enemies he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, how many Snares he walked among, and that there was in his own Boſom a ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and treacherous Heart, by no means to be truſted. Thou maiſt ſee his Self-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, Self-Condemnings, his Fears, his Cares, his Profiting by Ordinances, his Conjugal Affections, his Senſe of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his Care to make his Peace with God, and to keep up a Communion with him, and a great deal more. The Father of Mercies bleſs all to thee, and make thee a Bleſſing to others. So Prays</p>

I muſt beg your Acceptance and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of this the laſt Legacy of your Deceaſed Friend, who, tho dead, you find ſpeaking. You may now take a Review of me (if ſo vile a Thing as I was, can be worth your Pains); I have in the following Papers, given you ſome Paſſages of my Diary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſed, in which I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as impartially as I can (if my Heart deceive me not) to give you the view of my Dark Side, as well as my Bright. And both for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: By the former you may take a view of the miſerable Corruption of my moſt wretched Nature. You have there the very Picture and Character of one poſting to Hell; the Wiles and Subtilties of an active buſy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; the Snares and Baits of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching World; and the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Conſequences of bad Company. By the latter, you may behold the wonderful Rich and Free Grace of God in Chriſt to me; to me, I ſay,

one of the vileſt and greateſt of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; to me, that had hardened my Heart, after many and many a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and might upon that account have expected ſudden Deſtruction, and that without Remedy: To me, that had not only ſinned my ſelf, but had drawn others into Sin too.

            <p>I The ſaid <hi>Gervaſe Diſney,</hi> was born<note place="margin">Birth.</note> the Day of <hi>March</hi> 1641, at of Religious Parents, <hi>viz. John Diſney</hi> of <hi>Swinderby</hi> in the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Eldeſt Son (by a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100468:19"/>
Second Venter) of Sir <hi>Henry Diſney,</hi> of <hi>Norton-Diſney,</hi> Kt. and <hi>Barbara</hi> his Wife, who was the Eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Gervaſe Lee,</hi> of <hi>Norwell-Hall</hi> in the County of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> They had nine Children lent them by the Lord, <hi>viz. Cornelius, Elizabeth, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſe, Mary, John, Sarah, Samuel, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, Daniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> died very young: The former of the <hi>Purples,</hi> and tho<note place="margin">Sarah.</note> very young, yet had a good Savour of Spiritual Things upon her Heart; and in that Sickneſs a longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt. She was eſteemed one of the beautifulleſt Children that ever was ſeen, her Hair being Milk white, and Complexion pure white and red; yet it was judg'd her greateſt Beauty lay within, the Lord having betimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned her Soul with Ornaments of Grace: and from the abundance of her Heart, her Mouth did often ſpeak, to the great Comfort and Refreſhment of weeping Friends that ſtood about her. She called much upon God, as her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. My Father one Day ſtanding by her Bed-ſide, and hearing her fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100468:19"/>
cry out, <hi>O my Father, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> asked her who ſhe meant, did ſhe mean him? <hi>O no, no,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>it's my Heavenly Father I cry after; you are my Father on Earth, but it's my Father in Heaven I want: You cannot help me, but he can.</hi> Many ſuch like Paſſages I have heard my Father <hi>Diſney</hi> report of her, which ſhewed her to be more ſit for Heaven than Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel</hi> alſo died young of a <hi>Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Samuel.</note> being removed from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when about the Age of 4 Years. He was a Child of moſt pregnant Parts, and had a ſtrange underſtanding in the beſt Things: He was indeed a good Young <hi>Samuel,</hi> and feared God from a Child. He was my Father's great Favourite and Darling; in his Company, and with his pretty Talk, my Father did much delight; and would therefore uſually, at his walking Hours (which he did pretty much for Exerciſe) he muſt lead his young <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> by the Hand, and then could not but admire his pious Talk, his ſtrange Queſtions in Divinity; which (I have heard my Father ſay) ſometimes he was aſtoniſhed at: and ſometimes his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100468:20"/>
Queſtions would be ſo deep, that lie was almoſt non-pluſt to anſwer. He was extraordinary Inquiſitive, and would uſually demand a Reaſon for every Thing under Debate.</p>
            <p>He loved Prayer, and would not (tho ſo very young) be got to Bed without it; his wonderful Ripeneſs in his Infancy, ſeemed a Preſage and Prognoſtick, in his Friends Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, that he was not like to be long one of this World; he ſeemed indeed to be, tho a Bud, yet ripe for nipping. As ſoon as Sickneſs ſeiſed him, my Father ſent down Hill, at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> to good Old Mr. <hi>Reyner,</hi> to deſire his Prayers for him; and not long after went down himſelf to make Enquiry after him: Mr. <hi>Reyner</hi> preſently told him, (I believe with Sorrow enough) that as to his Son <hi>Samuel,</hi> he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign him to God, and prepare to part with him, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he did not believe he was long for this World; and, ſaith he, I ground my perſwaſion upon this, when I pray for his Recovery, I find ſtrange Reſtraints upon my Spirit, and am much dampt &amp; ſtrained; but when I pray that the Lord would fit him for

himſelf, and crown him with Happineſs to Eternity; when I beg for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Welfare of his Soul, I am then much enlarged.

(not only of that School, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) of that Town and Country. As to Grammar-Learning, his Maſter (Mr. <hi>Clark</hi>) was pround he had ſuch a Scholar to boaſt of, being indeed the very Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his School; and would therefore uſually put him upon the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tasks in Learning and Diſputing. He was a great Improver of Time in his younger Years: I having been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed he would hardly allow himſelf time for thoſe neceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſts that Nature might warrantably challenge; the ſpare time that he had from School, which other Scholars ſpent in Play and youthful Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he would conſtantly, with great Delight, ſpend in his Study; uſually riſing early, and ſitting up late for ſuch end. His great Proſiciency in Learning was ſuch, that he proved very uſeful (I may not ſay ſerviceable) to the Scholars of the ſame Form; for whilſt they were ſpending their ſpare Hours, with delight in Play, he would be ſpending his with as great delight in his own Studies, or in the Service of thoſe Idle Lads, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly engaged his help in preparing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100468:21"/>
their School-Exerciſes for them; they knowing well that what he did of that Nature, would paſs in School as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Pay, for the diſcharge of thoſe Debts they by their idle trifling Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour had contracted. He was likewiſe very forward in the beſt Things, truly Conſcientious (as in Charity muſt be believed) in his Cloſet-Duties, he ſpending much time there; a conſtant Attender upon Ordinances, both on Sabbath-days and Week-day-Lectures. He took Sermons very exactly in Short-Hand, and repeated them as diſtinctly, after, in my Father's Family.</p>
            <p>He was very uſeful to thoſe of us that were Younger, and would moſt frequently upon a Sabbath-day, in the Evening of it, take one or other of us to walk with him in the Garden, where he would always commune with us of Heavenly Matters; would enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Proficiency by the Means of that Day; would try our Knowledg in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Things; and as carefully inſtruct us, where he found Ignorance prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But above all, (which I muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget) he has ſo awakingly and pathetically diſcourſed to us about the

Joys of Heaven, and the Happineſs of Souls being arrived there; that I can ſay, I have even longed, at ſuch a time, to he out of the Body, and to be with the Lord; have been filled with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring Deſires to forſake the World's Husks, and to taſte thoſe Dainties of my Father's Houſe, which indeed my Brother did moſt lively and ſweetly repreſent to us: I well remember I have then been ready (with <hi>Paul</hi>) to deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt. At other Times, he would in ſo ſweet, yet ſtartling, manner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to us about the Pains of Hell, and the Eternal Miſery of Damned Souls; would ſo lively ſet forth Sin in its Black and Bloody Colours, as that which brings Souls to that place of horrid Darkneſs, that I, and (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) others of my Brothers and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, were ſuſſiciently ſtartled and frighted for that Time: It made me (whilſt the Thoughts were afreſh upon me) much afraid of Sin; my main Reaſon, alas! being then only (as I well remember) that I might eſcape thoſe dreadful Miſeries he had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us. I can ſay to the Glory
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100468:22"/>
of God, that thorow his Bleſſing upon my Brother's Diſcourſe, I have had good Impreſſions ſometimes upon me, which I muſt ſadly ſay too ſoon wore off again, being but as the Morning-Cloud, and as the Early Dew. He would with ſome others of his School-Fellows, who were of the ſame Form with himſelf, (ſuch as Mr. <hi>John Reyner,</hi> that moſt eminent Servant of God now in Heaven, Mr. <hi>Jonathan Robinſon,</hi> that Pious Chriſtian, now a Bookſeller in <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Peachall</hi> an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourney, and divers others, (then well diſpoſed) frequently meet together; and kept Hours, nay often whole Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoons, in Religious Exerciſes by themſelves: They took their Turns for the carrying on that Work, and uſually diſcourſed from ſome Text of Scripture at ſuch times; and this they did from Houſe to Houſe, doing good (it's hoped) wherever they came; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting conſtantly of ſome Auditors of the Houſe where they were. My Brother was ſeveral Years at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and a Member of <hi>Corpus-Chriſti</hi> Colledg; was an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Scholar, and ſuppoſed to have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100468:23"/>
but few Equals in Learning. As for Phyſick, he ſomewhat delighted in that Study, and proved not a little uſeful, to ſome, upon that account. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I my ſelf being much out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and weak, tho not Sick, at about 13 or 14 Years old, many thought I was going into a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> (the Diſtemper of our Family) I ſpit Blood, and had other Symptoms that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; he perceiving me diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at ſuch their Apprehenſions, told me I was not far gone in that Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and tho it ſhould prevail, might live 20 or 30 Years. He adviſed me to eat Raiſons frequently, and ſome time to drink my own Water every Morning; which I did for ſeveral Days, and through the Bleſſing of God moſt ſucceſsfully.</p>
            <p>Unhappy Differences (when my Brother was grown a Man) did too frequently fall out betwixt my Father and him, which did ariſe ſometimes a conſiderable height; ſome thought my Father too ſtrict with him, in his Years of Manhood, and others thought him abundance too ſtubborn and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious in his Carriage towards my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100468:23"/>
but further mention of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not become my Pen. Thoſe Differences reduced my Brother to great Straits; and I heartily blame my ſelf (who too often occaſioned the Quarrels) for want of Brotherly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and Tenderneſs towards him, when in Diſtreſs, and I my ſelf (tho a Child) in ſome Capacity, at <hi>London,</hi> to do it; (the Lord forgive me.)</p>
            <p>My Brother <hi>John</hi> died at about the<note place="margin">John.</note> Age of 16 Years, at <hi>Swinderby,</hi> of a deep <hi>Conſumption:</hi> And tho I (having for ſome Years before been an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in <hi>London</hi>) had not the advantage of intimate Acquaintance with him, nor therefore of making Remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for ſome Years before his Death; yet this I was certainly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of by thoſe who knew him beſt, that he lived a very blameleſs and unſpotted Life, and died a moſt comfortable and happy Death, reſigning his Soul into the Hands of God his Faithful Creator, and leaving a vain World with Joy and Comfort.</p>

Not to be born of Popiſh, Pagan, Turkiſh, or Debauched Parents, muſt needs be eſteem'd a great Mercy; and ſurely will be by thoſe the Lord does ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlighten: ſuch will know how prone Corruption within, will be to encline to an Imitation of what's bad and ſinful. But now to be born of Chriſtian Parents, yea, ſuch who are of the ſtricter ſort; ſurely this can be no leſs than diſtinguiſhing Mercy. If it be a Mercy to Children to be train'd up in the Nurture and Fear of the Lord, to be taught to be Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by the Example of ſuch Parents: If a Mercy to Children to be in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, to have a Stock of Prayers laid up in Heaven for them, to have wholeſom Counſel, ſerious Inſtructions, pious Reproofs, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Comforts, and neceſſary Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: If theſe things be Mercies, (as ſurely none will deny) certainly then the Children of religious Parents, have cauſe all their Days to bleſs God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100468:25"/>
for ſuch a Mercy. Here's now the advantage of Religious Education, when a Parent or Governor's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Children, committed to their Care, is moderated betwixt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of an unwarrantable Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and cruel Rigor; when Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſo deport themſelves in their good Conduct and Government, that Children may both love and honour their Preſence; when they are not too fond, leſt Children ſhould not fear them; nor too ſtern, leſt they ſhould fear them too much.

            <p>As to my Brother <hi>Daniel,</hi> in his<note place="margin">Daniel.</note> younger Years, he and I being both Abroad, and at great Diſtance each from the other, I had not the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of making particular Remarks. He had his Learning and Education in part, at the Lady <hi>Huſſy</hi>'s, with Mr. <hi>Birkitts,</hi> and after that with Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon,</hi> both of them Non-conforming Miniſters.

hopeful.) She proved a moſt tender loving Wife, a dear Parent, and a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtian, for many Years before ſhe was ſummoned from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which was on <hi>May</hi> the <hi>16th,</hi> 1690. A farther account of her, ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in this Book contain.</p>
            <p>I the ſaid <hi>Gervaſe Diſney</hi> being but<note place="margin">Gervaſe.</note> a weak Child (while young), by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Rickets I had in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, was as tenderly regarded and brought up; much Care was taken of me, eſpecially by my Mother, than whom, I believe there can't be any more loving, kind and tender-hearted breathing. I could not (by reaſon of my Weakneſs) go till about eight years Old; but long before that, I fear, could run ſwiftly enough in the Ways of Sin and Vanity. In theſe Years, I cannot ſay, that I had the leaſt ſenſe of the Corruption of my Nature, and the Evil of Sin, upon my Heart: Several Years I was carried in the Arms of one <hi>Anne Carlton,</hi> a Servant in our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who conſtantly attended me. Bent enough I was to play, and therefore for ſome Years, had a conſtant way of Hitching about upon a Cuſhion, the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100468:26"/>
better to follow and join with my Brothers and Siſters in their Sports, when by reaſon of the Rickets, my Legs would not carry me.</p>
            <p>The firſt Tidings of my Walking alone, was welcome Tidings to my Father and Mother, and brought by my Uncle <hi>Lee,</hi> (then a Tabler at our Houſe at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> for the Benefit of Free-School-Learning.)—It ſeems he, and the other Children, were engaged in ſome kind of Sports, that I had an Eagerneſs to purſue; when finding I could not follow faſt enough by Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, did ſtrangely and ſuddenly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture a trial of Skill after them, upon my Legs, holding by Tables and Stools as I went along. But O what a Miracle of Mercy am I (to the Glory of God be it ſpoken) who am now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving the <hi>48th</hi> Year of my Age, having for moſt of theſe Years been healthful and ſtrong, and little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Sickneſs! when as for ſeveral Years (when a Child) I was ſo weak that few thought I could live many Months. O that I ſhould out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live Seven of my Brothers and Siſters ſo many Years, who were all of them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100468:27"/>
ſo much ſtronger, and moſt of them ſo much younger than my ſelf! But God's Ways and Thoughts are not as ours. Surely as ſome times, yea, often I have thought, God has ſomething extraordinary for me to do, (tho the meaneſt and unworthieſt of all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants) only this I have learn'd (through Grace) to ſay heartily and chearfully <hi>Speak, Lord, for thy Servant deſires to hear; ſend me, Lord, upon any Errand, and ſet me about any Work, whether do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſuffering, and I thy Servant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires faithfully to attend it: If I may have but thy Preſence with me, and thy Supports and Comforts to refreſh me in my way, I ſhall be content.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I being in Childhood ſo long weak, was not ſent to School till about 12 or 13 years Old, and then to the Free-School at <hi>Lincoln;</hi> but did not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether loſe my time before; for my honoured and good Aunt <hi>Thorneton,</hi> who was with my Mother moſtly, from her Marrying with my Father, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me in my Engliſh Learning: Indeed to moſt, (if not all of us) ſhe was both Nurſe and Inſtructer; my Mother having Children thickly, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100468:27"/>
nurſing us all herſelf, was rendred leſs capable; and therefore my dear Aunt's Service was much more grateful and acceptable.</p>
            <p>I went not to School of ſeveral Years, and when I did, made but little Proficiency, having an averſneſs to-Learning, or rather to Study (the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom part of it); my Inclination and Fancy working rather to other Things, as Writing, Herauldry, Muſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe Exerciſes I uſed not only as Diverſion, but ſpent all the Time I could ever be Maſter of, in them. My Father therefore perceiving me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Learning, gave me my choice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Trade: I inclined moſt to a Herauld-Painter, (having by frequent Practice arrived at tolerable Perfection in that Art.) But that Employ being judged to be too burdenſom to an Apprentice, I inclin'd to be bound to a Bookſeller, the advantage of many Authors, and a good Library, being to me the main Inducement: But that, Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> told my Father was a declining Trade. At laſt it was concluded, with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of all concerned for me, that I muſt be bound, for 7 Years, to my
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100468:28"/>
Couſin Mr. <hi>Martin Oglethorp,</hi> a Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,<note place="margin">Apprentice.</note> and Merchant, in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet, London.</hi> And there I was placed about the Year 1661, and about the <hi>18th</hi> or <hi>19th</hi> Year of my Age. There alas! my Carriage and Deportment was ſuch, that I have cauſe to bewail my Folly, being not ſo diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in my Service as I ought to have been, in anſwer to a good Education the Lord had bleſſed me with.</p>
            <p>Theſe particular Sins (I remember)<note place="margin">Sins.</note> I was too frequently guilty of, <hi>viz. waſting my Maſter's Time,</hi> by employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much in my own Service, and that generally to my Diſadvantage; <hi>neglect of Duties, Equivocation,</hi> ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contrived, for the covering, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing, and hiding other Faults, which then, I remember, the Devil and my own naughty Heart perſwaded me was not Lying; yet ſince (through Grace) I have learnt to know was no better, being intended, and contrived, for the deceiving of others. And thus I have moſt wickedly (ſometimes) for the hiding one Fault from Man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many Sins againſt God. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thing for which the Lord has
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100468:28"/>
humbled me ſince, and ſhewed me the evil of, tho then I could not ſee it, was this: My Maſter being by Covenant bound to find me with Meat, Drink, Clothes, and other Neceſſaries at his own Charge; I finding him pretty penurious, however not ſuiting my proud Humour, I did often furniſh my ſelf with ſome ſuch Things at my own Charge out of that Money my Friends ſent me: Yet now and then (tho very rarely, and never, I believe, exceeded 40s. in all) I would pay for ſome ſuch Neceſſaries out of the Shop-Box; which being yet done in ſo clandeſtine a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I have accounted highly ſinful, and (bleſſed be God) has coſt me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Tear; tho ſince, one way or other, I believe, I have made more than dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reſtitution. Another Dreadful Sin I was in that Service Guilty of (the Review of which has been grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to me) was this; I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf to ſin alone, but did draw on and encourage <hi>John Mildmay,</hi> my Fellow-Apprentice, and under me, to ſin with me: And this I did ſo long, that he at laſt (which was but a juſt Judgment) became the greateſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100468:29"/>
Tempter to me; by this God has ſhewed me my Sin in my Puniſhment. But O the ſad Sabbaths that we have too often kept! ſometimes having waited on our Maſter into Church at one Door, we have got out at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And thus for ſome Hours have wickedly trifled away precious Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-time, by walking about from place to place for Pleaſure; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we have appointed Meetings at Ale-Houſes on Week-days, where moſt idly we waſted our Maſter's time, and our own Money. Once, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at ſuch a Houſe, where we were perfect Strangers, knocking 2 or 3 times for a Reckoning, no Body came at us; ſays <hi>John Mildmay,</hi> let's be gone and ſave our Money; with all my heart, ſays my wicked Tongue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd thereto by a worſe Heart: But we had not got half a Mile, before my Conſcience flew in my Face for that Wickedneſs; ſo that at my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, we went back and paid all. Thus ſinfully did we too often waſte our precious Time in Ale-Houſes, and ſometimes in worſe Houſes: Twice I think we went to Syder-Houſes, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100468:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proved Bawdy-Houſes, which yet we did not decline; ſome of our wicked Comrades having taught us (which the Devil ſet home to ſilence Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) that it was a good Way ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to frequent ſuch Houſes, and to aſſociate with ſuch Company, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to work in us an Abhorrence and Antipathy againſt the Practices and Sins of ſuch places. This plauſible Pretence, guilded Bait, and wicked Notion, was too readily eſpouſed by us, young Men (tho old Sinners;) this ſerv'd to ſtop the Mouth of Conſcience a while, till the Lord pleaſed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken it: And then I ſaw deſperate Folly in committing Sin, to prevent Sin; and thought of thoſe Texts, <hi>You may not do Evil that Good may come of it; and if Sinners intice thee, conſent not:</hi> And of the wiſe Man's Counſel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. ſpeaking of the Harlot, <hi>O let not thine Heart decline to her Ways, go not aſtray in her Paths; Come not nigh her Dwelling, for ſhe hath caſt down ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wounded: her Houſe is the way to Hell, going down to the Chambers of Death,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:100468:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>By unbecoming Dalliances, Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Carriages with young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Relations and others (in which I thought, in younger Years, there was no Evil) I fear I too often broke the <hi>7th</hi> Command: for tho never (bleſſed be God) guilty either of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery or Fornication; yet ſince I have learn'd to know, that there's more forbidden by that Command than is expreſs'd, and that every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſte Thought, Word and Action, is a breach of it, the review of ſuch youthful Follics, has been dreadful to me, ſince God touch'd my Heart, and gave me Grace to conſider. Some Sins (whilſt a Child) that I omitted before to mention, were ſuch as theſe; Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truant frequently, when I ſhould have been at School; and the better to colour over and hide ſuch Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, I ſeldom ſtuck at telling a Lie. Thus I added Sin to Sin, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Sin ſeldom goes alone); I have too often experienced it, that one Sin draws on to another: <hi>David</hi>'s Sin with <hi>Bathſheba</hi> had others accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it; his firſt Sin was Idleneſs, his ſecond Uncleanneſs, and then the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100468:30"/>
Murder of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> her Husband. I was alſo guilty of robbing Orchards, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and taking what has not been my own from my Brothers and Siſters, and Father; Fooliſh Jeſting, idle Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, ſlighting holy Duties, profaning Sabbaths, Diſobedience to Parents, and indeed what not? I had ſo baſe a Nature, and ſo wicked a Heart, even then when I could do but little more than go, that I boggled at almoſt no Sin that ſuch Age inclin'd to.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like Sins of Youth, made ſad work for Repentance in Riper Years; it was long before, but (bleſſed be God) at laſt, I ſet my Sins in order before me, with all their ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating Circumſtances: Then I thought of the Love and Light, the Means and Mercies, the Vows and Promiſes, the Exhortations and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the Reproofs and the good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I had ſinned againſt. Whilſt I was a Servant at Mr. <hi>Oglethorps,</hi> I was under good Family-Diſcipline, I had opportunity to attend upon the beſt Means, had good Examples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, was examined on Lord's-Day-Nights, what I remembred; but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100468:31"/>
alas! was too long a Trifler under all, which I have been much more ſenſible of, and afflicted for, ſince I left my Apprenticeſhip, than before. It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God there, to begin a Work of<note place="margin">Work of Grace.</note> Grace, which (notwithſtanding too many ſad Slips) I believe and hope he has been carrying on ever ſince: There it was, the Lord firſt enabled me to ſet my Face Heavenwards, and to engage me in ſerious Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the eternal Welfare of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul; moſt remarkably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved upon a Fit of Sickneſs, the Lord was pleaſed there to viſit me with; in a very few Days I was brought very low in Body, begun to be ſerious, to think of my Ways, and of turning to the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 59. was then full of Purpoſes, and Promiſes too, that (if the Lord pleaſed to ſpare me) I would (through Grace) mind Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as my Buſineſs, and follow the Lord fully. God was pleas'd to hear my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Prayers, and to ſpeed an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Peace to me; in a Day or two I was perfectly recovered; and my Body being healed of Sickneſs, I begg'd hard that my Soul alſo might be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Sin.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100468:31"/>
The Lord did wonderfully bleſs to me the Miniſtry of Mr. <hi>Brooks,</hi> (of whoſe Church my Maſter was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) and I therefore frequently had the advantage of hearing him: But eſpecially, the Lord was pleas'd to do my Soul good, by ſetting home, with power upon my Heart and Conſcience, ſome Sermons of worthy Mr. <hi>Flavel,</hi> ſen<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. (whom I muſt reckon my ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Father); but thoſe Sermons, with many others, to my very great loſs now, were conſumed by <hi>London's</hi> Flames; Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> himſelf died a Martyr for Chriſt the Year before, <hi>viz.</hi> 1665, (remarkable in that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mortality by the Plague.) Good Man, he durſt not fly from it, when the Hand of God, in that Plague, ſeem'd to be gone out againſt the City. He was willing (being a Miniſter) to hazard his own Body for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of others Souls; and ſo truly he did: for being taken at a Religious Meeting, he was carried before ſome Magiſtrates, who, (after ſome debate with him) plainly told him, they would ſet before him Life and Death, and leave him to make his choice.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100468:32"/>
They told him he muſt either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe never to preach at a Conventicle more, or they muſt commit him to a Priſon, (at that time) ſorely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Sickneſs. He was too great a Champion for Chriſt, and a more faithful Servant to his Lord and Maſter, than to ſtand long to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Anſwer, but readily told them, As to their former Propoſal, He did abhor the Thoughts of a Compliance, by deſerting his Saviour's Service; and as to their latter Threatning, he was freely willing to comply with the Will and Pleaſure of God, and could heartily ſay, His Will be done.</p>
            <p>So that he was (O height of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Cruelty!) committed to Priſon; there, preſently took the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and in a few Days, tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Earth to Heaven. After I was acquainted with this worthy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and had taſted and receiv'd ſome Benefit by his Miniſtry, (being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, at firſt, by <hi>John Southam</hi> a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-man Drugſter, in <hi>London,</hi> a very ſerious young Man, and one I muſt bleſs God for) I became a conſtant Attendor upon him, where-ever he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100468:32"/>
preached, either in City or Suburbs. He ſurely was as powerful, plain and practical a Preacher, as I ever did, or reaſonably can expect ever to hear: He had one Practice (though exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſeful) I think peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which was this; He would at his firſt entrance upon Sabbath-Day-Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Exerciſes, endeavour to raiſe his Peoples Affections, and to engage them to Seriouſneſs, by a moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening Exhortation, preſſing them to conſider with whom they had to do, the Great and eternal God, that ſearcheth Hearts; what they came about, no leſs than Souls Concerns, and that for ought they knew their eternal Welfare might depend upon their improving that Opportunity, which Prayer might prove their laſt Prayer, and that Sermon the laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that ever they ſhould hear.</p>
            <p>It was about the <hi>25th</hi> Year of my Age, when the Lord was pleaſed again to check and ſtop me in my Career of Sin, to awaken my drouſy Conſcience, to give me a Senſe of Sin's damning and defiling Nature, and of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a ſaving Change; which ſhould
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100468:33"/>
be accompanied with a ſtrict, ſerious and holy Converſation, if I would not eternally miſcarry. Here I made a ſtand, and began to conſider what I had done, and what I muſt do! Now began I to be ſenſible that I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enough bewail the Sins of my Youth; never enough live to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory of that God, who had given me to out-live thoſe Days of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; who had beſtowed upon me, not only ſpace for Repentance, but the Grace of Repentance too, as I truſt he did about that Time. Now it was that the remembrance of my Sins was more grievous to my Soul than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of them; the Sins I once loved, I now loathed, and would (if that had been poſſible) have given ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Worlds, I had never committed them. Now it was, I by Experience felt, (what before I would not believe) that the beſt of Sins Sweets are really moſt intolerably Bitter. I now expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the Truth of that Paſſage I met with in a Reverend Author, (Mr. <hi>Hardcaſtle</hi>) ſays he, <q>Let every Perſon that lies under a Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to commit Sin, ſeriouſly conſider
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100468:33"/>
thus; If I commit this Sin, I muſt either repent of it, or I muſt not: If I do not repent, it damns me; and if I do repent aright, I ſhall find it coſt me more Pains, and Trouble, and Sorrow, than the Sin was worth that I did commit.</q> And this I have often thought upon ſince, upon any Temptation.</p>
            <p>Conſcience now flew in my Face, and was more than a thouſand Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt me; now I did (by ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) feel the truth and terrour of that ſingle Text, <hi>A wounded Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence who can bear?</hi> And this (through Grace, I can ſay) that when I did not ſinfully ſtop its mouth, it was a faithful Monitor to me. That Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture terrified me greatly, <hi>The Soul that ſins, ſhall die.</hi> And here was my Argument upon it; The Law ſays, the Soul that ſins, muſt die; my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells me, But thou, O Soul, has ſinned, and what's the Concluſion? why very dreadful, <hi>thou muſt die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſet about the Work of Repentance, but muſt confeſs (till the Lord did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, by his Word and Spirit, ſhine in upon my Soul) I thought that bare
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100468:34"/>
Repentance was enough, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that true and ſaving Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance conſiſted in forſaking, as well as in confeſſing Sin: but here the Lord ſet home upon my Heart ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations as theſe; That his holy and righteous Law was broken, and Satisfaction muſt be made; that he himſelf was Juſt, and his Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied: And that all my Prayers and Tears, and Duties and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (though I ſhould uſe them as means) were yet no good foundation to build my Hopes of Heaven upon: That though I could ſhed a thouſand Tears, and thoſe of Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for one vain Thought, they would be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than puddle Water to juſtify and ſave me. Now did thoſe Scriptures ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> And that of <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Now the Works of the Fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100468:34"/>
Adultery, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Hereſies, Envyings, Murders, Drunkenneſs, Revellings, and ſuch like: they that do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> And though, I bleſs God, the moſt of theſe Sins that do entitle to eternal Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, I could not charge my ſelf as guilty of, yet ſome I could; and the leaſt of them, in their own nature, I found was damning, and would ſerve to exclude me out of the Kingdom of God; now (through Grace) was I ready to cry out, <hi>O what muſt I do to be ſaved! and a little ſeriouſly to enquire into my ſpiritual State, and after Jeſus Chriſt, and the way of Salvation by him.</hi> Now I began to think of the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Nature, and the Sinfulneſs of my Heart; and that all the impure Streams of my Life had proceeded from that moſt corrupt Fountain, <hi>Mar.</hi> 15. 19. And that it was not enough to bewail the outward Acts of Sin, but the inward Principles of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leading to it. Now I came to ſee my need of Chriſt, and to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100468:35"/>
that a ſingle Chriſt would be of more worth than ten thouſand Worlds; and theſe were the Texts of Scripture that did much revive me, viz. <hi>That Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sinners; and that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Tenders of him was to ſuch: And that the Covenant-Terms of Salvation were attainable</hi> (thrô aſſiſting Grace.) Iſai. 1. 18. <hi>Come now, let's reaſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaith the Lord, Though your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be white as Snow; and though they be red as Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool.</hi> O what Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is here, thought I, for me a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner! who though but young in Years, was yet old in Sin. And another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Scripture I often thought on, was <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. <hi>He that confeſſes and forſakes his Sin, ſhall find Mercy.</hi> And <hi>Iſai. 55. 7. Let the Wicked for ſake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts, and let him turn unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> I then, to encourage my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God, and the forſaking of my Sins, thought of the great Sinners that had obtain'd Mercy; ſuch as <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100468:35"/>
Mary Magdalen;</hi> and ſome of the very Jews, that had been guilty of the Blood of Chriſt, and had murdered the Son of God; yet (through Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith in Chriſt) many of them were pardoned and ſaved; nay <hi>Paul,</hi> (that eminent Pattern of God's free Grace, to great Sinners) and <hi>David,</hi> and others of God's Dear Children, (that had foully faln) was Encouragement to me a Prodigal, now to ariſe and go to my Father. Now I began to ſet upon a Courſe of Duties, which when I found I was pretty ſtrict in the performance of, I begun too much to reſt upon them: Now I was for believing, but hardly knew how to believe that Chriſt died for Sinners, ſo as to throw my ſelf, and reſt wholly upon him, and to think my Tears, and Prayers, and other Duties, will do me no good in point of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>When I had ſerved in my Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip about four Years, my eldeſt Brother <hi>Cornelius,</hi> being dead ſome ſhort time before, it pleaſing the Lord to viſit the City with the Plague, which began in the Street in which I lived; upon which my Father prevailed with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100468:36"/>
my Maſter to give me leave to retire into the Country, to him, during that Viſitation: Accordingly I came down in the Year 1665, to my Father's Houſe (then at <hi>Swinder by.</hi>) And then began other Sins to appear in me, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct or Remainders of Corruption in my Nature; I have great cauſe to bewail and lament that proud Garb I came from <hi>London</hi> in, having, I do believe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended as much for one Sute of Clothes, as would have clothed compleatly 40 poor Servants of Jeſus Chriſt. For which Equipage I contracted much Debt in <hi>London,</hi> (which my Father af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paid.) I had then ſo proud an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that I thought this Dreſs (thô exceſſively Gaudy) was but ſuitable to my Rank (thô alas much beyond it.) This Vanity I can hardly think of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bluſhing. Yet now living an idle Life, and being dreadfully puft up with Pride; tho alas! alas! I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World to be proud of, but rather to be humbled for; I preſently was under Temptation to think that I muſt now carry it out, and live at the Rate of my Father's Eldeſt Son, and not as Mr. <hi>Oglethorp</hi>'s Apprentice and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100468:36"/>
Servant. Now it was, that tho indeed I durſt not much aſſociate with wicked Companions, that were Strangers, tho Neighbours to me; yet I did it too much with thoſe that were Relations, and thought that Relation would juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy that practice, not conſidering the Snares of it. I there made too many ſinful Slips, went often to <hi>Norton,</hi> and <hi>Norwell,</hi> where I met with ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as (had not Free-Grace ſuſtained me) had certainly ruined me, both as to my Principles and Practices. There it was I fell to the Practice of good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, moſt undeſervedly ſo called, and then have been perſwaded to think that time well ſpent; could ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moſt wickedly triumph in my Ability to bear ſtrong Drink; not conſidering the ſad Woe in Scripture denounced againſt ſuch. At that time I learn'd to drink and game, and ſmoak Tobacco, and trifle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſpent (by Perſwaſion of others, tho my bad Heart was moſt to blame) not only Days, but Nights in thoſe kind of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but obſerve how unwilling the Devil was to loſe me,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100468:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who ſo lately had been his Prey, and led captive by him at his pleaſure. But yet, after theſe Relapſes, (for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver magnified be diſtinguiſhing Love) the Lord graciouſly gave me a Check; and after ſome Reproofs and Advice from Parents and ſerious Friends, I again begun to conſider my Ways: Conſcience was ſtartled, and begun to do the Office of a faithful Monitor: And this Scripture was often in my Thoughts, and ſounded terribly in mine Ears, <hi>He that being often reproved, and hardeneth his Heart, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without Remedy.</hi> Much precious Time I did waſte and trifle away in thoſe Days, in ſinful Delights and Pleaſures, the want of which I now ſadly experience. Several Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, one after another, I courted; being invited thereto by one Friend or other: and too many of my Addreſſes of that Nature, were too extravagant, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, and ſinful (which the Lord has humbled me much for ſince.) From <hi>Swinderby,</hi> I went to <hi>Barkſton,</hi> with my Father and his Family, who went to ſettle there, for the ſake of Mr. <hi>Trott</hi> the Miniſter of that Town, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100468:37"/>
a worthy good Man; (whilſt there) I went ſometimes to <hi>Grantham</hi> to hear ſome Non-Conformiſt Miniſters, as there was opportunity for their Preaching (which was but ſeldom); much Soul-advantage I received then, through the Lord's Bleſſing upon Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi>'s Miniſtry, who was then a Non-Conformiſt of very great Note.</p>
            <p>After this, my Father buying a Houſe at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> we removed to it; and thither the Lord in his Providence ſent holy, humble and worthy Mr. <hi>Abdy,</hi> to be Paſtor of that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for which he had Liberty by the King's Proclamation, and Licence of Indulgence. Here I delighted greatly to attend upon thoſe Ordinances, through God's Bleſſing upon which, and an intimate Correſpondence I held with him, I received much benefit. Then began I, in good earneſt, to ſet my Face Heaven-ward, and to mind the great Work the Lord ſent me into, and continued me in the World about. Now began I not only to obſerve my private Retirements for Prayer, but to pray in my Father's Family (tho too hypocritically) in thoſe my firſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100468:38"/>
I have cauſe enough to believe. However, having caſt a Look Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Hell was preſently in an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, the Devil ſtorms at it; my old Companions begin to upbraid me for it: which yet the Lord gave me Grace to bear with Patience, as knowing that I had much better bear, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Frowns of wicked Men, for being Religious, than the everlaſting Frowns of the great God for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo.</p>
            <p>But here let me ſtop a while, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the tranſcendent Goodneſs of my Heavenly Father to me a moſt vile Wretch, That he ſhould do more for me than others, who I think had done leſs for him, and more againſt him than moſt others. What, ſuch a Brand as I ſnatch'd out of the Fire! Such a wandring Prodigal brought home to God! O my Soul, ſtand and wonder! What, ſo hard a Heart as mine ſoftned! So proud a Heart as mine humbled! So obſtinate a Will as mine ſubdued! O amazing Goodneſs! <hi>This is the Lord's doing, and muſt always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>About the Year 1670, I was by many<note place="margin">Marriage.</note> Friends recommended to ſeveral good Matches, but particularly by that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and Worthy Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, my Couſin <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially I met with at my Brother <hi>Hatfield</hi>'s, who there acquainted me that he had it long and much upon his Thoughts, to recommend a Perſon to me he believed would make me a good Wife; That he knew her to be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Worth, and the only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married Daughter of Mr. <hi>Spateman:</hi> He encouraged me very much, that though I ſhould not proceed in that Affair, yet the Acquaintance of ſo good a Family would ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe my Pains and Journey. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome mature Conſideration, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him Thanks, and embraced the Motion; and ſoon after went to that Houſe, where (though I was then a perfect Stranger) yet through the very great Freedom and Kindneſs of the good old Gentleman, I ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came acquainted; was received with much Candour, and entertained with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100468:39"/>
a hearty Welcome. So ſoon as his Daughter came down, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 6 a Clock, to Family-Prayers, he put us (I remember) both to the Bluſh, by telling her here was one Mr. <hi>Diſney</hi> come, as recommended to her for a Sweet-heart. After ſome ſhort time, I had encouragement to proceed in the Affair, was much pleaſed with the Family, and with the Report I had of the Perſon to whom I was to make my Addreſſes. Providence ſeemed to ſmile upon the Tranſaction; our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, after ſome Debate, came to an Agreement, as to Terms. So that when we had ſought God ſolemnly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Day, (that I deſired we might keep for that purpoſe) by Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Otefield,</hi> we came to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <p>And that happy Union betwixt my Dear Wife, Mrs. <hi>Rebecca Spateman,</hi> and my ſelf, was made the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1671, (being Thurſday.) We were married by Mr. <hi>Nixon</hi> of <hi>Morton,</hi> at <hi>Trinity-Chappel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here methinks I cannot but take notice (to the Honour of God) what a Wife he was pleaſed to lend
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100468:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me; God has made her to me the greateſt outward Bleſſing, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that ever I had to the time of her Death. The uſual Properties of a good Wife are ſuch as theſe, Piety, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Love, Faithfulneſs, Chaſtity, Houſewifery, Frugality, Self-Denial, Meekneſs, Patience, Subjection, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and Helpfulneſs. I do not know any in the World that can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouſt of a Wife exactly thus qualified; but do believe moſt of them to be in mine, a valuable Portion indeed to this time, (when we have been married 14 years) I have found her firſt and laſt.</p>
            <p>She is a truly good Woman, yet but a Woman, and therefore ſubject to humane Frailties; her Spirit was ſomewhat too high, and my Humour a great deal too proud, and this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd too often Jarrings betwixt us; but (through Grace) we have both ſeen the ill Conſequences of ſuch ſtrife, and the Lord has made us more uſeful and leſs provoking one to another.</p>
            <p>It was then conſidered, where we ſhould make our ſetled abode; <hi>Roade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nooke</hi> Friends were deſirous we would either be there, or near them, when
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100468:40"/>
at the ſame time my Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Diſney,</hi> deſired we would be with them at <hi>Lincoln;</hi> and ſeveral Reaſons of weight were urged on both ſides, which put us into a great Strait and Labyri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th, being deſirous as near as we could to pleaſe them all, and not diſoblige any: So that this Medium was by me propos'd, and as readily approv'd of to fix ſome-where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Friends; and the Place concluded on was <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where, though I was a perfect Stranger to the Town, and knew not one Perſon in it, yet (after ſeeking of God in the Matter) we were wonderfully induced to take a Settlement in that Place.</p>
            <p>And now being reſolv'd (and that with the Approbation of our Friends) upon a Removal thither, we conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Tabling would beſt comport with our Circumſtances at that time: We ſoon then enquired, and found out, (by the help of Mr. <hi>Reyner</hi>) a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Family to table in, <hi>viz.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>'s in <hi>Bridleſmith-Gate,</hi> whither we came the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1672. And I muſt ſay it was a good Providence that brought me thither, not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100468:41"/>
on the account of a good Land-lady we tabled with, and the good Society we had with worthy Mr. <hi>Secker</hi> and his Wife, (who were Tablers there at the ſame time) but eſpecially upon account of the good Acquaintance I there preſently got, and the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opportunities for our Souls we there enjoy'd. The Reaſons inclining us to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> were ſuch as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;</p>
            <p>1. The very good Society there to be had, and the comfortable Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there to be enjoy'd, not only on Sabbath-Days, but Week-Days too. Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Barrett,</hi> being the Miniſters of that Society there, that I and my dear Wife entred our ſelves unworthy Members of, (bleſſed be God for that;) they carried on the Work for the moſt part on Lord's-Days; and every Wedneſday there was a Lecture car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by all or moſt of the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Miniſters there-abouts, in the Counties round; they taking their turns in that Work.</p>
            <p>And O what cauſe have I to bleſs God to eternity, for the comfortable

Enjoyments of that Place! there, I think, my Heart was more carried out after God in an Ordinance, and I did enjoy more of God in a few years, than I had done, perhaps, all my Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. There indeed it was we ſat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our own Vine with delight; there could we go to our ſolemn Aſſemblies, where Multitudes with us did keep Holy-Day; there did we long enjoy our Sanctuary-Bleſſings, none making us afraid: There had I opportunity of converſing with thoſe ſerious Chriſtians, in whom was my delight; <hi>(viz.)</hi> Mr. <hi>Lupton,</hi> my firſt Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a holy Chriſtian, and one uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, loving, and aſſiſting to me in all Offices of Love whilſt he lived; <hi>James Coates,</hi> a near Neighbour, a plain Man, but a hearty Chriſtian, a Perſon moſt unwearied in Labours of Love, and always active in ſerving the Church of Chriſt; Mr. <hi>Muſſon,</hi> a moſt lively and refreſhing Companion, a Man of as meek, humble, and heavenly a Frame, as any I think I ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd: And the Reverend, my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy good Friend Mr. <hi>Reyner,</hi> who was extreamly uſeful whilſt he liv'd, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100468:42"/>
moſt heartily lamented when he died; his Memory is precious to me, and I believe will be to all good Men that knew him; but theſe are all gone to Heaven: and ſurely then it was time for me to leave <hi>Nottingham,</hi> having before parted with ſo many Friends I dearly lov'd. Others in <hi>Nottingham</hi> I ſoon got acquaintance with, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of great Worth; but theſe named were my intimate Friends and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Acquaintance, whom I eſpecially valued becauſe they fear'd God. I bleſs God for this Experience, as to my firſt inducing Motive to <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another Reaſon inclining me to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> being alſo very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive, was this; That I ſhould come into that Town a perfect Stranger, and was perſwaded I ſhould find it a much eaſier matter to make choice of new good Companions there, than it could be to ſhake off my old bad Companions at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> if I ſhould ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle there: when the Lord toucht my Heart, and ſet my Face Heavenwards, I durſt not again truſt my ſelf amongſt the Snares and Temptations of thoſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100468:42"/>
near <hi>Lincoln,</hi> that had ſometimes been Brethren in Iniquity with me.</p>
            <p>I was now much upon my Watch, my Heart having too often deceiv'd me to be much truſted. I had found it too treacherous at <hi>London, Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derby, Barkſton</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore durſt not but guard it well at <hi>Nottingham.</hi> Though I can ſay (and heartily bleſs the Lord for the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) God has wrought up my Heart to an univerſal Abhorrence of Sin, and a Love to the Ways of Holineſs; ſometimes indeed, and too often, Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Temptation runs me into too great, (though, bleſſed be God, not groſs) Miſcarriages; and Pride, I ſee, at the bottom of all.</p>
            <p>But O! after ſuch Stumbles, God has help'd me up again, and humbled me, and made me more watchful and circumſpect: I now experience (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be Free-Grace) God has given me a tender Conſcience; I am now afraid of Sin, yea, of any thing that looks like Sin. I can indeed remember the time when I could have committed apparent Evils with leſs Trouble and Terror of Conſcience, than now
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100468:43"/>
(through Grace) the very appearance of Evil in me is accompanied with. And this I do experience, that all the Service that Sin has ever done me, is this; I have been, after, the more enlarg'd in Prayer. I have put (through aſſiſting Grace) greater Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency into them, and I have been much humbled in bewailing them, and very importunate with Tears for the Lord's Pardon.</p>
            <p>3. The third Thing that perſwaded me to <hi>Nottingham</hi> was, that my Self, Wife, and all our Relations, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of our Deſign, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Reaſons of it: here we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with great Content and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at Mrs. <hi>Gamble</hi>'s, for almoſt a Year and half. And then we finding (through the Lord's Bleſſing) our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſomewhat altered and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, and we in a Capacity to furniſh part of a Houſe, we then concluded to take Lodgings partly furniſh'd, which we did, and entred upon Rooms at Mr. <hi>Roger Ryley</hi>'s as Tennants, the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1673. Here we had a little Family, but obſerv'd partly the ſame Methods for Family-worſhip
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100468:43"/>
we do now; not only for our own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but I hope to the advantage of ſeveral of Mr. <hi>Ryley</hi>'s Family too: His eldeſt Daughter liv'd with us, and <hi>Nelly,</hi> a younger Child, came very often to join with us, both on Week-Days and Sabbath-Days; and I do truſt, God made us ſome ways uſeful to that Girl, who I obſerv'd to have a good appetite to ſpiritual Things; ſhe came to Repetition and Catechiſm; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was pretty forward for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and I do hope retains her Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, (now being a Servant in the City of <hi>London</hi>): We continued there not quite three Years, where though we could not expect to get much good from our Neighbours, in the other part of the Houſe, (they being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally too carnal) yet the Lord made it a comfortable Settlement, in regard (I truſt) the Lord ſo far bleſſed our weak Endeavours, as that we did ſome good there, (as ſome of them, yea, Mr. <hi>Ryley</hi> himſelf did acknowledg.)</p>
            <p>But now, yet finding our Condition, as to worldly Matters, encreaſing, (through the Lord's Bleſſing) and our Family alſo enlarging, I took a Houſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100468:44"/>
of Mrs. <hi>Smith</hi>'s, over againſt the Caſtle, and entred upon it the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1676, and that Houſe we furniſhed compleatly; the Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our Pride in that. After we had continued ſome time here, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to go to <hi>Lincoln;</hi> and my Father's Deſign then, being ſhortly to leave that City, and to live in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> at Brother <hi>Stanyforth</hi>'s at <hi>Firbeck,</hi> he did earneſtly and importunately ſollicite me, by ſeveral Letters, to live in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> with him. His main Reaſons for cohabiting were;</p>

            <p>Theſe Reaſons fully ſatisfied my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Diſney,</hi> and Mother; and I had their Leave to continue at <hi>Nottingham:</hi> and here the Lord bleſſed me wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; though now and then I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rebukes of Providence, yet was ſtisfied all was in love to my Soul, and to the advantage of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-Man.</p>
            <p>Several Troubles I met with upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Nonconformity; though I did believe, and did accordingly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, that it was my Duty to go as far as I could, with a ſafe Conſcience, in obeying the Authority I liv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: And was perſwaded in my own Breaſt, That I could never take Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in thoſe Sufferings I brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelf, by not doing what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority enjoin'd, and I might lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comply with without Sin.</p>
            <p>About <hi>April</hi> 1682, when the Spirit of Perſecution grew hot in <hi>Nottingham,</hi>

and much of the Malice of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſeem'd to be levelled againſt me; I thought I had a Call, and was thereupon reſolved (with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of God) to remove, and that, as ſometimes we thought, to <hi>London,</hi> grounding my Opinion of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it upon ſome Reaſons, but eſpecially upon that Text of Scripture, <hi>If they perſecute yon in one City, flee to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi> For about half a year I ſought Counſel of God in the thing, having always a deſire to be where God would have me.

On <hi>October</hi> the <hi>19th,</hi> 1682, (Winter being far come on, and Ways bad) I took up a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, with the advice of Friends, to ſettle at my own Houſe in <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that I had bought upon the <hi>High-Pavement.</hi>

ſerving him: Much Money it coſt me to take off Fines and Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Some Miniſters were taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lodgers, at thoſe times, at my Houſe; as Mr. <hi>Barrett</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdine.</hi>

            <p>Upon Mr. <hi>Shelverdine</hi>'s Taking, I find this <hi>Memorandum</hi> in my Diary; <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>The firſt Day I begun the courſe of having Miniſters to help me in my Sabbath-day-work, Mr. <hi>Shelverdine</hi> being that Day the Perſon my Siſter <hi>Wigley</hi> (who liv'd then by us) deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red might take the firſt turn, and begin the Work.</q> He was taken by an Officer at the Lady <hi>Berresford</hi>'s, who had deſired ſome help from him, and was committed to Priſon, where he lay ſome Weeks, but was as ſoon as might be, with Mr. <hi>Barrett,</hi> (who was afterwards taken at my Houſe) releaſed out of Priſon by the ſaid Lady <hi>Berresford</hi>'s Kindneſs, who paid down 40 <hi>l.</hi> for that purpoſe, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both ſuffered in her Service.</p>
            <p>And now methinks, I have cauſe to fear my Sins had a hand in ſtripping me of ſuch a Mercy; and O that my heavenly Father would ſhew me
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100468:48"/>
wherefore he thus contends with me! It looks, in my Apprehenſion, as if the Lord judg'd me and my Family un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of ſuch a Bleſſing as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is. The Lord pardon thoſe Sins that thus provok'd him, and give me to underſtand ſo dark a Diſpenſation; but in all my Sufferings, I ſtill expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced much of the Goodneſs of God, in moderating often, the Spirits of Men towards me, in raiſing me up Friends, and in reſtraining ſome that had very ill Will (though without cauſe) againſt me.</p>
            <p>Well, now I ſoon found <hi>Nottingham</hi> too hot longer to hold me, and my Thoughts went much upon removing; but wither I could not tell, though a ſpeedy: Removal was neceſſary; I being under the Sentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and feared a Writ would be ſoon taken out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And beſides, I found that there was no way to take off that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, (which I feared moſt upon the account of Orphans, and others buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, lodged in my Hands) but either Conformity, (which I durſt not yield to) or leaving the Town, (which I was reſolved upon) as the beſt Expedient for my Eaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:100468:48"/>The Lord who has never failed me in a time of Trouble, now appeared for me in his Counſels and Conduct. I was now upon Terms with my Couſin <hi>Clar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And ſhe, at that time, being at <hi>Wigwall,</hi> thither I went; and as ſoon as I came, I met with a Letter from Mr. <hi>Barrett,</hi> (my moſt worthy Friend, who was conſtantly contriving for my well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both in Soul and Body) acquainting me that there was a Houſe at <hi>Ollercarre</hi> to be det, which might prove a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Seat for me; and here, (though I met with ſome Rubs) yet God in his Providence ſeemed to point out that Habitation to me. I went to view it, and though it was upon diſadvantage, there being much finiſhing work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Doors wanting, yet I liked it ſo well, as hoping it might prove a quiet and comfortable Place to me, beſides the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100468:49"/>
Priviledges appertaining to it; That I concluded to take a Journey to Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> about it: but his Bailiff, who lived with his Family in the Houſe, (and as I perceived ſince, had no deſire it ſhould he let) told me he would ſend to Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> to know his Terms, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with my deſire of taking it. How he managed his Buſineſs I know not, but the anſwer he returned me, was, that his Maſter <hi>Burton</hi> would not let it under Sixſcore Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> which was 20 <hi>l.</hi> more than he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore offered it to others for. This I took to be a croſs Providence, and had proceeded (I think) no farther, but for my Brother <hi>Spateman,</hi> who adviſed me that nothing could be done, or known, without my going thither, who offered very kindly to go along with me; thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we went, and in a few Days I took the Houſe, for 30 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> leſs than was mentioned, to the great grief, (I did perceive) of the Bailiff; who (it's to be feared) conſulted his own profit, more than his Maſter's inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
            <p>And truly this Providence I cannot overlook, <hi>viz.</hi> That I had not had the

To the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 85, I find in my Diary Acknowledgments, Day by Day, that I had experienced the Lord's Goodneſs, in caſting my Lot into this Place; having to that time enjoyed moſt comfortable Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, &amp; for the moſt part very publick Aſſemblies, to the refreſhment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well as our ſelves.

            <p>At my firſt coming to <hi>Ollercarre,</hi> it was much upon my Heart to conſider what I ſhould render unto the Lord for all his Benefits towards me and mine: I had this ſerious Reſolve, That I would not ſhut God out of my Houſe, who was pleaſed to give me Entertainment in it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Here again, at my firſt coming, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed my Covenant with God, and did deſire and beg, I might bring a new Heart to my new Habitation; and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily give God Entertainment, where he has been pleaſed to give me Admiſſion.

O the comfortable Sabbaths, Sermons, Sacraments, Faſts, and Family-Duties here enjoyed! O the ſweet Repaſts we had for our precious Souls! Now did I begin to make a more ſtrict Scrutiny into the ſtate of my Soul than ever, and was now for weighing the Reaſons of my choice of Chriſt in the Ballance of the Sanctuary; did ſit down and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with my ſelf what it might coſt me to be Religious, and whether or no I could be at that Charge.</p>
            <p>Well, but did theſe Halcion Days always laſt? Did my Sun ſuffer no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe? Alas, alas! we ſoon ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our Comforts; and by Sin as ſoon involv'd our ſelves into the Depths and Labyrinths of Miſery and Trouble.</p>
            <p>An Account of which, take from my Diary, to this purpoſe; <q>Upon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100468:52"/>
the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1685, (being the Day that (the firſt Tidings of the D. of <hi>M</hi>'s Landing in the Weſt came into the Country) I had, by ſeveral Friends, one after another, Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the <hi>Nottingham</hi> Magiſtrates, had intercepted a Letter of mine; in which, they found a Paper written in Characters; and preſently cry'd, Treaſon, Treaſon: This Paper they preſently ſent to many Perſons in the Town, if poſſibly, to get it read, but (it ſeems) all in vain, either they could not, or would not read it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A very great ſtir they made about it, concluding it was the D. of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s Declaration, and contained a Call to me to appear in Arms for his Aſſiſtance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were their idle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Conjectures, which put them upon threatning me in a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner, and ſending out their Warrants to ſeize me either at <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi> or <hi>Derby,</hi> that I might read the Letter, (as was alledg'd.) This Paper they never ſent me, nor could I poſſibly ſuddenly know the Contents of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though I did underſtand it came
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100468:53"/>
from my Brother <hi>Daniel Diſney,</hi> (who was that Term in <hi>London.</hi>) I confeſs this Tidings did ſomewhat ſtartle me, and made me ſome Days then abſent my ſelf from my Habitation, as not knowing what Injury my reading the Characters might be to my Brother; though I knew it could be none to me, (whatever it prov'd to be.) I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it beſt to lie <hi>incognito,</hi> till I could underſtand from my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he had written in thoſe Characters; to that purpoſe, I ſent my Couſin <hi>Watſon</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> (or to <hi>Epſom-Spaw,</hi> 12 Miles further) to find him out; which Journey he went, and came in ſafety, though altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs, my Brother being newly come down to his own Houſe at <hi>Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead,</hi> contrary to his former Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In a Day or two after, my Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin <hi>Watſon,</hi> (being now return'd to <hi>Ollercarre</hi>) was ſeiz'd by Souldiers at my Houſe, and preſently committed Priſoner at <hi>Derby,</hi> who by his moſt imprudent Anſwers to thoſe Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories put to him by the Officers, did ſomewhat prejudice Mr. <hi>Chauntry,</hi> a young Miniſter, taken at my Houſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100468:53"/>
with him; and might have done hurt to others by Imprudency, had not the Lord's over-ruling Providence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. The D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Army now increaſing, things begun to be in a great Uproar and Confuſion; many Gentlemen of this County were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, and ſeveral of them ſent to <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> a Place far remote from their Habitations, and ſo near the Sea, that People were fill'd with ſad Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, concerning the further Conſequences of ſuch a remote Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinement; many Rumours there were that I ſhould be fetch'd in immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Friends advis'd me to withdraw, which at firſt I did decline, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding my Innocency would be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Protection to me; but when I ſaw it did not prove ſo to others, and did conſider the Character-Paper, (the Contents of which I knew not) I took their Advice, and did abſcond about the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1685, and (I bleſs God) did find moſt hearty wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and Entertainment, in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Families the Lord in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did direct me to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:100468:54"/>But no ſooner was I gone than the Countries round (as well as <hi>Derbyſhire</hi>) did ring with Hue-and-Crys after me; great Sums of Money now offered for the taking me, by thoſe, who were as full of Rage and Malice as could be, breathing out nothing but Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt me, ſuggeſting moſt wickedly and falſly, that I had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Duke with 600 <hi>l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him two Months in my Houſe, and was certainly gone to him.</p>
            <p>Others as falſly reported, that I was taken with his Declarations in my Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and a Letter of Thanks from him for my Kindneſs to him, in befriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Intereſt.</p>
            <p>At my going away from <hi>Ollercarr,</hi> I firſt went to <hi>Mansfield,</hi> upon the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1685, (that Day being their Fair) whither (as I hear ſince) I was followed by the Sheriff of <hi>Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and was very much in danger; many I met upon the Road (coming from the Fair) begg'd of me to have a care of my ſelf, for great Inquiry was made after me, and ſearch for me. A little before that time, I being in <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> upon Buſineſs with my
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100468:54"/>
Landlord <hi>Burton,</hi> (which occaſioned my ſtay 3 or 4 Hours) and had no ſooner taken Horſe, than (as I underſtood ſince) Officers came to my Inn to ſeize me. Here the watchful Eye of the Lord was upon me for good.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Mansfield</hi> Fair-day at night, Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers came to <hi>Ollercarr</hi> to apprehend me; others were making diligent ſearch for me at <hi>Nottingham</hi> at a great many Houſes, giving me moſt revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Language, and threatning me with Death when ever taken; and ſome (as was reported) ſaid I ſhould never come to a Trial, for they would ſhoot me, and tear Bit from Bit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they met me. Theſe poor Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who I never injur'd, but have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſerved, I can heartily pity, and pray for, and if ever I have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſerving them, do hope to let them ſee that my Religion teaches me to do good to my Enemies, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite Evil with Good; <hi>the Lord forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time, I was at Friends Houſes not far from home, but thought it now convenient, for greater ſafety, to remove further, and was directed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100468:55"/>
by a Friend (who very kindly did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me) into <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire:</hi> Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we went, and (as the Lord was pleas'd to order it) juſt in time, for preſently after I could not have got away, there being ſtrict Watches ſet night and day for me, in all or moſt of the Towns (for many Miles) round about <hi>Ollercarr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We travell'd from one place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, not ſtaying long in any till we came into <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire.</hi> And the Lord preſerved me in all my Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, (bleſſed be his moſt holy Name) and gave me much Favour in the eyes of thoſe I viſited, and had with all moſt hearty Welcome, and free Entertainment. Many remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Paſſages and great Providences I experienc'd, as I came from Place to Place, mention'd particularly in my Diary, and therefore leſs needful here; only this; <q>Upon the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1685, I find my Experience noted in the ſaid Diary, That notwithſtanding my Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Threatnings, and, my Fears, my Dear God had wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerv'd me; ſo that, through Mercy, no Evil has hitherto befaln
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100468:55"/>
me. O that I could take Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from my Father's Goodneſs to live more the Life of Faith, and to depend more upon God! upon that God that has brought me out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Troubles, and kept me from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Dangers; he has delivered, does deliver, can deliver, and I truſt will yet deliver me. O that in the mean time preſent afflictive Diſpenſations may be to his Glory, to my Soul's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and my Relations Benefit!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> I came to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> where for better ſafety, I went by the name of—; there I had moſt friendly Entertainment, found him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good chearful Company him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as thoſe alſo, who were ſeveral of that Neighbourhood that came to ſee me: Here I had very comfortable and Soul-refreſhing Society, and Safety while I ſtaid: And upon the <hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1685, upon the advice of very worthy and good Friends, ſuch as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Brother <hi>S.</hi> &amp;c. (beſides my own Inclinations) to ſurrender my ſelf to the D. of <hi>N.</hi> I came away in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening from Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and therefore could reach no further than <hi>Duffeild</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:100468:56"/>
that Night: We got not thither till 11 a Clock, and therefore concluded it beſt to ſtay at a little Ale-houſe, at the hither End of the Town, that <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey Batty</hi> knew, though I did not. And here I obſerv'd a great Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the Watch-men of that Town juſt ſtood at the Door where we light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being (I have cauſe to believe) at that time, in an eſpecial manner, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to look ſtrictly for me, as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, all the Watch-men for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miles round about my Houſe were directed to do. Theſe Watch-men demanded my Name, but <hi>Godfrey</hi> very prudently, by telling them his, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their further Inquiry; there we lighted, and the Watch-men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently came in, who I entertain'd with Ale and Tobacco, and left <hi>Godfrey</hi> with them, whilſt I, in my Clothes and Boots, went to lie down upon a Bed in the next Room, being both Sleepy and Weary; but now being under a ſlaviſh Fear, and a diſquieted Mind, leſt I ſhould be taken before I had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred, (for which the good Lord forgive me) though I did get 3 or 4 hours Reſt, yet not one wink of Sleep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:100468:56"/>In the Morning early, the Conſtable came, who knocking at the Window where I lay, I verily thought I had been ſurprized; but it appeared, it was only to ſee whether the Watch-men duly obſerved their Office: the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord ask'd <hi>Godfrey</hi> my Name, which he refuſed then to tell him, but promiſed he would the next time he ſaw him; which, as the Lord ordered it, did ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy; though he told him he could ſtop and ſecure me if he would.</p>
            <p>By 6 a Clock, on Wedneſday Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I got to my Houſe at <hi>Ollercarr;</hi> and though in the way I met with and ſaw ſeveral People, who (I believe moſt, if not all) knew me, yet, through the Lord's Reſtraints, none to hurt me.</p>
            <p>By 9 a Clock that Morning, after I had ſtay'd about 2 Hours with my Dear Wife, (whom I had not ſeen of long before, and was her ſelf under ſome Trouble, and having Warrants out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, as was ſaid, was a little before forc'd to keep from home)—I went to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> at <hi>Wallen-wells,</hi> who being abroad, came not Home till 8 a Clock that Night.—I acquainted him
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100468:57"/>
with my Deſign of ſurrendring my ſelf to the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his Company with me; I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him timorous and ſomething ſhy;- he told me he would not do it till he had obtained firſt the Duke's leave to that purpoſe; upon which (by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on purpoſe) he acquaints the Duke with my deſire to ſurrender my ſelf to him. To which the Duke made this Return on Thurſday Morning; he gave him many Complements and Thanks for his Letter, but told him that as for Mr. <hi>Diſney,</hi> he might ſecure him, and expected that he came along with him. Upon this ſtartling Anſwer, I began to think I had taken a wrong Method in this Surrender, and did expect nothing leſs (from the Duke's Letter) than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent to <hi>Nottingham</hi> Goal. That Day about 4 a Clock we went to <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> when I feared to find him the more ſevere upon me, becauſe of the Corporation-men of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> who (I underſtood) dined with him that Day. But here I again experienced the Goodneſs of the Lord, who had ſo wonderfully moderated his Spirit, that I found him very calm and kind; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100468:57"/>
him, that I underſtanding he had ſent his Warrant out againſt me ſome time ſince, I was now come to wait upon him to know his Pleaſure. He replied, he never ſent out any War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant againſt me, nor had he any thing to charge me with, only a great Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour there was of a Character-Paper directed to me, which the Aldermen of <hi>Nottingham</hi> had ſent to King and Council; that therefore it was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient I ſhould be forth-coming, till he had acquainted the King and the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> with my Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render; and did not doubt but in a Week's time he ſhould receive Orders for my Liberty. In the mean time, he wiſh'd me to make choice of any Friend in the County to be withal.—I named my Uncle <hi>Lee,</hi> which he readily appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, ſent his Servant and Letter with me.—And thither we came on Friday Morning about 10 a Clock, there I had kind Reception and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Entertainment, as alſo my Wife and 2 Servants with me: Here again the Devil ſet his Agents a-work to raiſe ſlanderous and lying Reports of me; by ſome it was reported, that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100468:58"/>
of <hi>Nottingham</hi> were drawing up a Paper againſt me, to ſend to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> others that I was run away pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately from my Uncle <hi>Lee;</hi> ſome that I was a Priſoner at <hi>Newark;</hi> others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported me hanged in the Weſt, at the ſame time the Lady <hi>Liſle</hi> was executed; others ſaid that <hi>John Oliver</hi> of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> was juſt going to <hi>London</hi> to ſwear Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt me, and ſome others; but I might eaſily prevent and ſtop him, by laying an Action I had upon him, and ſo impriſon him: But this Counſel I utterly diſliked, and bleſs God none of theſe things did much move me. A Paſſage in my Diary giving this Reaſon for it, <q>I can heartily truſt the Lord, who has all along been my Helper; I can with Comfort enough ſet a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle God againſt all mine Enemies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt I was at my Uncle <hi>Lee</hi>'s, (which was between 5 and 6 Weeks) my Uncle was unwearied in his Pains for me; going twice to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> thrice to the D. of <hi>N.</hi> and once to <hi>Ollercarr,</hi> in my behalf; was very ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous and deſirous to ſet me right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that had aſperſed me, the Lord require him more than I can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:100468:58"/>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 10, 1685. my Uncle <hi>Lee</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the D. of <hi>N.</hi> acquainted me the D. was much troubled for my long Confinement, but could not help it; that he had ſent 3 ſeveral Letters to the Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> to know the King's Pleaſure about me, but could receive no Anſwer. He concluding they had nothing againſt me, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he ſhould upon his own Head, and without Order ſet me at Liberty; and if poſſible afterwards take advantage againſt him for ſo doing; he being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they watc'd to take Pique againſt him, reſolved he would give no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: Therefore, by a fourth Letter, acquaints the Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> that he was reſolved he would not ſet me at Liberty, without the King's Order, and deſired to hear (with what ſpeed might be) his Pleaſure about it.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Auguſt</hi> 26, 1685. being at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> with my Uncle <hi>Lee,</hi> my Mother <hi>Diſney</hi> gave me a Letter, <hi>Ben. Bromhead</hi> brought from <hi>London,</hi> from my Couſin <hi>W. Diſney</hi> ſome 3 Days before he died (who was executed as Printer of the Duke of <hi>M.</hi> Declaration) full of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Deſires, that I would take care of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100468:59"/>
his Daughter with me (ſhe being both Fatherleſs and Motherleſs): The which (by the Grace of God) I ſhall do, and look upon her as a Child Providence has caſt upon me as my own. The Letter bore Date the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1685. had lain ſome time before King and Council ere it was ſuffered to be ſent to me; but bleſſed be God it did me no hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 28, 1685, being Friday, the D. of <hi>N.</hi> by a Servant on purpoſe, gave me tidings of my Liberty by a Letter he ſent me, which he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> to this purpoſe; That it was the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Command, that I ſhould be ſet at Liberty, upon ſuch Security as his Grace thought fit. And now here's Food for Faith to feed upon, a gracious return to Prayer. Thus the Lord was pleaſed to reſtrain the Hands of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Enemies, that had threatned me Ill; and to influence the Hearts of great Men to do me Good. I have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 13. <hi>For I have heard the Slander of many: fear was on every ſide, whilſt they took counſel together againſt me, they deviſed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100468:59"/>
to take away my Life; yet I have ſeen the Goodneſs of the Lord in the Land of the Living.</hi> And have good encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with holy <hi>David</hi> to ſay, <hi>At what time I am afraid, I will truſt in the Lord.</hi>

            <p>My Uncle <hi>Lee,</hi> and I, then went to the D. of <hi>N.</hi> where the D. receiv'd me very kindly; and told me, though he had nothing at all againſt me, yet being the King's Letter to him had mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Bail, he would adviſe me to enter into Bonds for the good Behaviour, my ſelf in 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and my 2 Sureties in 1000 <hi>l.</hi> a Man. This I declined very much, yet at the Duke's importunity (after I had taken ſome time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on it) I very unwillingly granted to endeavour it; and, indeed, I muſt ſay, a great many I found very ready to ſerve me in the Thing: But the D. himſelf having named to me my Uncle <hi>Clay</hi> for one, and my Uncle <hi>Lee</hi> having offered himſelf for another, I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon them; and to that purpoſe deſired my Uncle <hi>Lee,</hi> to ſpeak to my Uncle <hi>Clay,</hi> he being juſt then going to <hi>Southwell,</hi> which he did, but ſent me word by my Man, (who went with him) that my Uncle <hi>Clay</hi> poſitively
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100468:60"/>
refus'd me; but (as I have ſince heard, and do believe it) 'twas not in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs; for he acquainted the D. of <hi>N.</hi> he did not think me in earneſt in that Requeſt another made, having neither Letter nor Meſſage from me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; but my Couſin <hi>Low,</hi> his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law, did very chearfully accept of piece of ſervice for me.</p>
            <p>We all three accordingly, went to the D. of <hi>N.</hi> to enter into Bond; but the Duke declaring ſome great Pique againſt my Couſin <hi>Low,</hi> fell into a Paſſion, and declared he would not take <hi>Low</hi>'s Bond for a Groat; and ſince <hi>Clay</hi> would not, <hi>Lee</hi> ſhould not be Bail for me, but I muſt get two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This prov'd a good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for meeting with this Croſs, I took heart to ſend the Duke word, that I having no ways appear'd againſt King or Government, nor any ways miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaved my ſelf, did think it very hard thus to be call'd to enter into Bond for the Good-Behaviour. The Duke return'd by Letter, this Anſwer to me, That ſince I had declined en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Bonds, he had, by Letter, acquainted the King that no Body
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100468:60"/>
came in againſt me, that I was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enter into Bonds; (being no ways guilty) and left it to his Majeſty's further Pleaſure; only bad me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member he had mine, and my Uncle <hi>Lee</hi>'s Promiſe to come to him (if ſent for.) And thus (through Mercy) I have eſcaped thoſe enſnaring Bonds, having heard nothing from the D. of <hi>N.</hi> to this <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1685, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt four Months, and I truſt I may not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 31, 1685; This Day I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and my Wife, and Mr. <hi>Coats</hi> and his Wife, to <hi>Ollercarr.</hi> Upon the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1685, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd a very comfortable Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being the Sabbath-Day: good Mr. <hi>Coats</hi> preached a Congratulatory Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for the Lord's Goodneſs towards us, in bringing us together again! who had ſo long been ſeparated one from another; he preaching from thoſe words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 12. <hi>What ſhall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto the Lord for all his Benefits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me?</hi> and rais'd this Doctrine, <q>
                  <hi>That</hi> gracious Souls have, and ought to have, ſuch a Senſe of Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, as to be extraordinarily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100468:61"/>
forth in Love and Thankfulneſs to God for them. In the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he told us, We might take ſome Meaſures of the Greatneſs of the Mercy, of Deliverance God had wrought for us, by conſidering the Greatneſs of thoſe Troubles, and the Perplexity of the Condition we were moſt of us in; ſays he, Was it not ſad for a Family, once ſo united, not only in Affection, but in a ſweet and delightful Society, to be ſhattered and broken all to pieces?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Was't not ſad that a Houſe ſhould ring with Oaths and Curſes, that for ſome time before had no ſuch Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to be heard in it?</q>
               <q>Was't not ſad! that a Family ſhould be quite left and forſaken of thoſe ſweet and comfortable Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths it had ſome time enjoy'd in great ſecurity?</q>
               <q>In a word; Was't not ſad, that we, who had ſo often join'd together in Family-worſhip, as Reading, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Praiſing God, ſhould be ſo ſeparated one from another; that we could not aſſemble together for ſuch Worſhip without apparent Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100468:61"/>
nay ſome of us caſt into ſuch Places where there was no Worſhip of God to be join'd in? Here was our Miſery. God give us all a lively Senſe of Divine Favour in our great Deliverance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When God had returned me to my Family, my earneſt Prayer was, I might not return to Sin, but honour God more in it than ever, who had done ſo much for me and mine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> the <hi>10th,</hi> 1685, (the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being juſt met) We kept a Night of Humiliation, by the help of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>C.</hi> and Mr. <hi>C.</hi> the Latter made a Sermon from theſe words, <hi>Iſai. 8. 17. And I will wait upon the Lord that hideth his Face from the Houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and I will look for him.</hi> They were much enlarged in thoſe Duties; and I do at this time experience (bleſſed be God) both in them, and Cloſet-Duties, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame occaſion, my Heart was in a good warm Frame, and was work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much after God. God has heard and anſwered our Prayers moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably, as appeared by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's putting forward things very beneficial to the Nation; they did,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100468:62"/>
I believe, beyond either the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who brought moſt of them irregularly in, or others who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed expected nothing of good from them.</p>
            <p>But by this, I have learn'd this Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that by thoſe from whom Men expect leaſt, God can do moſt; and I fear we have loſt many and many a Mercy, by knocking at wrong Doors for them, and by truſting too much to, and expecting too much from an Arm of Fleſh.</p>
            <p>The Lord I do find and experience,<note place="margin">Benefits by Afflictions.</note> has (by bleſſing to me late Afflictions) done me this Good, (bleſſed be his moſt holy Name.)</p>

            <p>I kept a conſtant Diary or Journal, recording my Carriage towards God, towards others, and my ſelf, and God's Carriage towards me; giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſignal Returns to Prayer, and great Providences; a few here take.</p>
            <p>The <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1674, (being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rainy at night,) I travelling to <hi>Laughton</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> upon the <hi>Moore,</hi> about a Mile and half off the Town, I light into a deep watery Place, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the pav'd Bridge, my Horſe ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, fell ſide-ways, I all over in the Water, and a great Mercy I was not loſt, by the Horſes lying upon me; my Man drew me out by my great Chamlet-Cloak, which help'd me to ſwim; I rid afterwards to the Town wet to the Skin, with Boots full of Water; immediately went to a hot Bed, took ſomething warm, pray'd to the Lord, and got a good Night's
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100468:64"/>
Reſt; and next Morning was never the worſe: This good Providence I deſire to remember, acknowledg and improve.</p>
            <p>2. When we liv'd at Mr. <hi>Ryley</hi>'s in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> my Wife being one Night juſt gone up into a very narrow ſtrait Chamber, being immediately to return down again, having a Candle with her; a Gun was diſcharged in the Street, made an amazing roaring, and noiſe all over the Houſe; but in that Chamber ſuch a Noiſe, as much affrighted her; next Day, I coming into the Chamber, found a round Hole in the Caſement by a conſiderable large Bullet made, which (the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber being ſo very narrow) it could no ways have miſt her, had not a good God wonderfully preſerv'd her from the Danger, by <hi>directing the Bullet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. A good return to Prayer: <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1674, which the Lord, <hi>in mercy, help me to improve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. A gracious Return to Prayer, in my dear Wife's Recovery of ſuch a Sickneſs as moſt gave her over, in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1674.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:100468:65"/>5. <hi>January</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> 1675, coming with my Wife from <hi>Wigwall,</hi> and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through a thick Wood to <hi>Roade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nooke,</hi> one Bough of a Tree coming up on my Eye with a great force, one being juſt gone by before, and held it back, it (ſlipping from him) ſtruck violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon my Eye, ſo that I concluded it ſtruck quite out; it ſtood immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Gore-blood, was ill a little time, but (through Grace) in 2 days ſo well, that I could ſee to record this ſingular Providence; which Eſcape and Deliverance, I deſire to aſcribe to Divine Goodneſs, as a Return to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and deſire I may uſe my Eyes more to the Honour of God.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>January</hi> the <hi>14th</hi> 1683, I and my Man <hi>Sam. Fone,</hi> being going a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Rotheram,</hi> about ſeven Miles off of <hi>Nottingham, Sam</hi>'s Horſe ſlip'd, and fell on the ſide of a Hill with his Leg under him, which was greivouſly brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſtrained, and he ſo full of Pain, that I was forc'd to return to <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> with him: In my return, ſuch a like Fall I got, my Horſe lying upon me a conſiderable time, for he could not riſe; and had he riſen of himſelf,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100468:65"/>
it might have broken my Leg, which lay juſt in a Cart-rut; and <hi>Sam.</hi> being lam'd before, could not help me; but now, providentially a Perſon comes riding by, juſt at that inſtant, did help me up; and through Mercy, I got not the leaſt Hurt, though my Fall ſeem'd much more dangerous than <hi>Sam</hi>'s, who was lame and under the Chirurgeon's Hand long. This is a diſtinguiſhing Mercy, which I deſire to improve to the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>7. The <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1677. In the Cloſe of that Day, in Cloſet-Prayer, I found my Heart ſo warmly carried out after God, that nothing would ſerve my turn but God, and I truſt God gave me himſelf: Bleſſed Lord, enable me to improve ſuch a Priviledg.</p>
            <p>8. My Father <hi>Diſney,</hi> in his time, and I for ſome Years after him, were perplexed with long and tedious Suits by <hi>John Oliver</hi> of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> a Bankrupt, who ſued in <hi>formâ pauperis:</hi> He did moſt wickedly occaſion ſeveral People to forſwear themſelves againſt me, particularly one <hi>Jane Farrow</hi> of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi> aged about 54, a Woman ofa bad Life, and no Principles; ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100468:66"/>
ſubpena'd by <hi>J. O.</hi> to be an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for him: At our ſitting a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion at <hi>Lincoln</hi> for that purpoſe, ſhe the ſaid <hi>Jane Farrow</hi> did ſwear poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively that the Goods in <hi>J. O</hi>'s Shop at the time my Father ſeized them, were worth 1500 <hi>l.</hi> and therefore ſhe would conclude my Father was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly ſatisfied <hi>J. O</hi>'s Debt, and had no right to detain his Eſtate longer from him. Though I at the ſame time brought ſubſtantial Witneſſes, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of good Credit and Reputation, who upon Oath made appear juſt the contrary; one Mr. <hi>Snowden,</hi> in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, ſwore that he had a Judgment of a 100 <hi>l.</hi> upon the Bankrupt's Eſtate, and went at that time my Father ſeized, with a deſign to take out Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution upon the Goods, but not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of near a 100 <hi>l.</hi> value, did deſiſt. Since this, the ſaid <hi>Jane Farrow</hi> has told ſome the Reaſon of her Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo deſperately was, That <hi>J. Oliver</hi> had inſtructed her, and others of his Witneſſes, what to ſwear; had made them all drunk, and then (as ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt) they ſwore any thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:100468:66"/>Since, this poor wretched <hi>Jane Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> was viſited with Sickneſs, and died <hi>Feb.</hi> 27, 1683. and upon her Death-Bed was in a moſt ſad deſpairing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and cried out much againſt her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf for being forſworn. She told thoſe about her that ſhe ſaw the Devil, and there, ſays ſhe, he ſtands (pointing to a Place) ready to fetch me away: She very frequently ſpoke the ſame or the like Words. O! ſays ſhe, thou art come to fetch me; I am certainly thine, and ſhall be with thee er'e long. She further added, it muſt needs be ſo, if Mrs. <hi>Diſney</hi> (meaning my Mother) and Mr. <hi>Diſney</hi> (meaning my ſelf) does not forgive me. Some about her told her (for ſhe had many Viſitors daily) that ſhe muſt call upon God for Mercy, (who alone for Chriſt's Sake could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give her) but ſhe bad them ſay no more of that; for ſhe had nothing to do with God nor Chriſt, nor would ſhe receive any Soul-advice, as concluding ſhe muſt be damned. She ſent for <hi>J. O.</hi> that wicked Wretch, who was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Ruin of that poor Woman's Soul (if the Lord ſhewed not Mercy at laſt Gaſp); and told him, that for his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100468:67"/>
Sake, and at his Requeſt, ſhe had damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Soul, in forſwearing her ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Diſney.</hi> He endeavoured to pacify her, by telling her ſhe had ſworn nothing but Truth, and adviſed her not to regard what any ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: But this did not do, for ſhe ſtill cries out moſt horridly againſt her ſelf, deſired thoſe about her to pray for her Death. But ſays ſome by her, <hi>Jane,</hi> we fear you are very unfit to die: to which ſhe preſently replied, ſhe knew ſhe muſt be damned, and the Devil ſtood ready for her. And thus ſhe lived 2 or 3 Days, and went out of the World in a ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing Condition. A moſt remarkable Inſtance indeed it is of God's Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon a perjured Perſon. May o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take warning by it, and ſuch as are guilty in the ſame kind, repent in time.</p>
            <p>9. An Inſtance very remarkable of two others I could not but here inſert, which I had certainly atteſted by near Neighbours, and my own Tenants at <hi>Swinderby;</hi> One <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Simkin,</hi> at <hi>Harby</hi> (having been at <hi>Agle</hi> Feaſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home late) ſays <hi>Smith, Come we muſt gallop, Neck or nothing, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100468:67"/>

            <p>10. <hi>Novemb.</hi> 26, 1684. being Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, at Dinner, ſome of our Servants diſcovered Quick-Silver amongſt the Pudding they were eating, and we at our Table had eaten on before; we preſently concluded it muſt be ſome that had ſcattered into the Cheſt where the Meal uſed to lie, in which Cheſt, at our removal from <hi>Nottingham,</hi> I brought a Pot of Quick-Silver that I kept by me for Weather-Glaſſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things: we all eat of the Pudding, but none of us, through the Mercy of God, experienced the leaſt Prejudice from it.</p>
            <p>11. At <hi>Nottingham,</hi> whilſt we lived at Mr. <hi>Ryley</hi>'s Houſe, a ſad Fire broke out the at <hi>William Stirrop</hi>'s a Flax-man, next Mr. <hi>Reckliſes,</hi> at about 11 a Clock at Night, which did burn and flame ſo furiouſly, by reaſon of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100468:68"/>
great quantities of Combuſtible Matter there, that in all probability it had much endangered the conſuming the Town to Aſhes, had it not been for this great Providence, <hi>viz.</hi> That very night, and at the very time, when its likely all, or moſt others were a-ſleep in their Beds, We (as the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to order it) had a Religious Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at our Houſe, where many were aſſembled to ſerve God; Mr. <hi>Billingſley</hi> (being towards the concluſion of that Exerciſe) and we (met in a Room part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt thoſe Flames) did ſoon eſpy them, and as ſoon diſmiſt thoſe likely to be ſerviceable at ſuch a Work, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Hawkins, Jo. Boote</hi> and others, who being freſh and active, did ſoon (thrô the Bleſſing of God) quench that Fire, there being very few others that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; which made ſome ſay, they were conſident there was a Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that Night, there were ſo many Diſſenters about the Fire. How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully ſo ever theſe might ſpeak, I believe Mr. Mayor (then <hi>Parker</hi>) at <hi>Hencroſs,</hi> was more ſerious, when he told me the Town of <hi>Nottingham</hi> was much beholden to our Conventicle
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100468:68"/>
for the timely ſtopping of thoſe Flames.</p>
            <p>12. The <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1685. this Night (through extraordinary Drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs) at Family-Prayer, I ſlep'd 2 or 3 times; and awaking again, did not uſe the beſt means I could, and ſhould, of ſtanding up to prevent the Drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I hop'd might go off without it. Upon which (being dropt again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep) to my Apprehenſions, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing gave me a great Blow upon the Middle of my Back, which preſently awaked me in a Fright, which I did really feel paining me ſome Minutes after I was awaken. I have purpos'd upon it, and hope (through Grace to perform it) to be always more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the future againſt ſuch a Sin.</p>
            <p>This brings to my Mind another Providence of like nature; My eldeſt Brother being to repeat a Lecture-Sermon one Night in my Father's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, I being then very young, (and not liking that Work) cry'd to go to Bed, and to have my Brother with me, in which (after ſome repulſe) I was gratifi'd in my Deſire: to our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we went, and into Bed I got, but
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100468:69"/>
before I could drop aſleep, I felt the bottom of the Bed-clothes lift up, where preſently ſomething pull'd me by the Toe, but nothing there was to be ſeen: this affrighted me exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and though young, I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it a Rebuke to me for hindring that pious Exerciſe of Repetition, and durſt never do it after.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100468:72"/>
Earth, which whilſt I live I hope to follow with my Prayers to the great God, and our heavenly Father, for his Bleſſing upon. This I was the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther induced to do now when through Mercy in perfect Health, that I might have no Worldly Affair unſetled to diſturb and diſtract my Mind withal, when upon the very Confines of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and lying upon a Sick-Bed, or Death-Bed, when I deſire God may have all my Thoughts, and all my Time, and would fain be moſt ſerious and intent upon Soul-Concerns.</p>
               <p>This little Treatiſe in three Parts (containing the moſt remarkable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of my Life that occurr'd to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and collected out of my Diary, written in Short-hand) as a laſt Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I heartily commend to thy peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and other Friends that ſurvive me: In it I have endeavoured impartially, to God's Glory, to give the darker Side of a vile Wretch on Earth, as well as the brighter—. I was long, thou ſeeſt, a Wanderer from God, and in a moſt bewildred Condition on that account. I knew not where to reſt, till I anchor'd on the Rock of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100468:73"/>
Ages; had no true Peace, till, through Mercy, I clos'd with Chriſt the Prince of Peace: Conſcience then often ſpoke when it was not heard, and flew in my Face, when my Study too much was, to check, ſtifle and huſh it. I was then a Terror to my ſelf, and perhaps to others about me; eſpecially obſerving Chriſtian Friends, who fain would, but then could not prevail with me to be ſerious, ſtrict and good. I was too long, God knows, in the Gall of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and in the Bonds of Iniquity; and O what rich Mercy was it I was not then taken from Earth, and thrown into Hell; that through Grace I did out-live the Years of a looſe, carnal, freſhly and unregenerate State. O, my Dear! I cannot expreſs the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, the Terrors, the Heart-break and Trouble, that my youthful Follies coſt me in Riper-years: My Cloſet was witneſs to ſomething, and my God to more; but alas, all too little! if Free-Grace ſave me not, I muſt yet periſh: but of this I nothing doubt, through the Merits and Mediation of my bleſſed Redeemer, to whom I hope in Heaven, to Eternity, to give the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100468:73"/>
Glory of what he has been pleaſed to give me the comfort of. The Lord has fully convinc'd me, that all my Prayers and Tears, my Searchings and Watchings, can nothing avail me without Chriſt: God ſhew'd me my loſt and undone Condition, before I had thought of enquiring what I muſt do to be ſav'd, or of looking out after a Saviour.—And this, through Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I can ſay, that I could never have truly a quiet Minute, till I was moſt ſweetly perſwaded, and powerfully enabled to cloſe with Chriſt, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Goſpel. O Rich-Grace! Free-Grace! And now, Dear-heart, let me invite thee into the Embraces of bleſſed Jeſus: Come, taſte and try how good God is to returning Sinners. I believe thou haſt: Well, be more and more in love with Chriſt, enter into Covenant with God, and frequently renew thy Covenant-Engagements, and labour to perform Covenant-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; never think thou can'ſt do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for that God thou expecteſt ſo much from; nay, indeed thy all, that can either make thee happy here, or to Eternity.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. SEttle thy Temporal Affairs, and Wordly Concerns betimes, that upon a Death-bed thou maiſt not be diſtracted and diverted with them, from higher and more beſitting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. I delay'd making my Will too long, which was no ſmall Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to my Mind, till the Year 1685, (when I did it.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou can'ſt think me worthy thy Remembrance, forget not ſhewing ſome Kindneſs to ſuch Relations and Friends of mine, who I need not name, being known to thee, who are Objects of Pity, and need thy Charity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If thou do'ſt not incline to a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> in the Houſe I leave thee for thy Life, then be with, or as near as may be ſome of thy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Friends, ſuch as may be Helpers and Promoters, not Hinderers of thy eternal Welfare.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the Lord ſhould again incline thee to marry, dare not to join thy ſelf
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100468:74"/>
in that Relation to any that is not join'd to the Lord; marry one, I ſay, who in the judgment of the beſt of Friends, as well as thine own (which may in ſuch a caſe deceive thee) do's truly fear God; nay, I would adviſe thee to marry one of a healthful, ſtrong and ſound Conſtitution, by whom if the Lord pleaſe, thou may'ſt have the Bleſſing of Children; for I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe, that ſome Weakneſſes and Infirmities, whilſt a Child and Young, might render me leſs capable in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If thou ſhouldeſt have Children, train them up in the fear of the Lord, help to fill Heaven with thy Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Having marry'd, own thy Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band as thy Head, ſubmit to the Duties of a Wife for the Lord's Sake; labour and pray for a meek and quiet frame of Spirit, which is in the ſight of the Lord of great price.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Have ſome eye over, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into the Behaviour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of thoſe I were ſome-time intruſted as Guardian for; Jog and quicken Loyterers Heaven-wards;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100468:75"/>

                  <p n="13">13. If the Lord ſhould again make thee Head of a Family, and bleſs thee with Children, as well as Servants, take care of their Souls, train them up for God, and let thy Houſe be a Nurſery for Heaven; take an account every Week of their Proficiency in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: and always eſteem of thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants moſt, that love, fear, and ſerve God beſt.

               <p>SINCE my laſt particular View of my Diary, deſign'd in the Treatiſe of my Life, I find my up's and down's, and that I am but a poor, vile and weak Creature, unable of my ſelf to anſwer by a holy and humble Carriage the Lord's great Goodneſs to me, in late ſignal Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances out of Trouble, and that upon better Terms than I could expect. I was now no ſooner at eaſe and reſt, thrô the Lord's Mercy, and at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than I grew ſecure, and begun to be too regardleſs of Soul-Concerns. I too little remembred and conſidered Promiſes made when under Affliction,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100468:79"/>
and neglected too much to pay thoſe Vows. My Circumſtances when in Trouble, were a Snare to me in ſome Particulars.</p>
               <p>In my Diary, the 19th of <hi>September</hi> 1685, I find my ſelf bleſſing God for his Protection and Care of me in my Journey and Exile, for the Friendſhip of Relations at <hi>Norwell</hi> and <hi>Southwell.</hi> I am there begging pardon for ſinful Compliances; as in ſitting late in an Ale-houſe in <hi>Southwell,</hi> where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were Healthing it about, though bleſſed be the Lord, I drank not much; yet I was a bad Example, in ſitting and ſipping with the Wicked, in waſting my precious Time; my Prayer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, that the Lord would pardon that and continue Mercies, and give me a thankful Heart in, and a lively ſenſe of Divine Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>The 20th, being the Sabbath-day, through Mercy, I find my ſelf in a pretty good Frame of Spirit, and took particular notice in my Diary of Mr. <hi>Coats</hi>'s Subject, which was, <hi>Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me all ye that labour, &amp;c.</hi> I there find a Deſire that the Lord would work thoſe Truths more and more
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100468:80"/>
upon my Heart by his Spirit, that my Sins may be pardoned and my Soul proſper.</p>
               <p>The <hi>21ſt,</hi> Under ſome Dulneſs, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ſlaviſh fear of Man, which I find bewail'd that Day, with this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, That the Lord would enable me to live by Faith, and that I might encourage my ſelf in the Lord my God under all outward Diſcouragements whatſoever, who has delivered me, does deliver, and I truſt will deliver me, his poor Creature. O! that my Sins may not provoke the Lord to turn away his Face!</p>
               <p>The <hi>23d.</hi> Having this Day been ſtating Accounts with my Wife and ſeveral others, with reference to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements the three Months in the Summer of my Exile, and Troubles in the Year 85; though I find them extraordinary large, yet, thrô Grace, I find my ſelf free from thoſe Paſſions, that upon ſuch Accounts, I uſed to be prone to: my experience again there recorded of God's gracious Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances for me.</p>

                  <hi>27th.</hi> I took notice of the many comfortable Sabbaths that I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſince I came home, without Fear or Diſturbance: Couſin <hi>Billingſley</hi> preached here from theſe Words, <hi>Commune with your own Hearts;</hi> which much affected me.</p>

I am yet delivered from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, notwithſtanding their Rage and Threatning, and from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring Bonds: I begg'd then of the Lord, That he would continue this Mercy, and give me to live a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, holy, humble and fruitful Life, and pardon the particular Sins of this Day, and help me againſt it, and to perform Promiſes made under my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>9th.</hi> I there bleſs God for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of that Day, and beg pardon for my Sins, and that the Lord will cauſe me to live better the next Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>10th.</hi> My Sins ſtare me in the Face, being many and great; there I find my ſelf begging that I might eye the Blood of Chriſt, and might, through Grace, be intereſted in it, being the only Sovereign Remedy for a poor Sinner; yet I am preſerved from enſharing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100468:81"/>
Bonds; and enjoy (through Mercy) comfortable Liberty, and ſit under my own Vine with delight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>11th.</hi> This I find a comfortable Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, when Mr. <hi>Coats</hi> did moſt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call, invite and encourage Sinners to come to Chriſt: O! that I may not ſtand out; the Lord bleſs the Sermon to my poor Soul, and pardon my Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>12th.</hi> No actual Sin that I know of. I this Day begg'd Direction from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven about the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> I and others in my Family were called to take; and next day I did take it, having obſerved no Intimations from the Lord againſt it, but being well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied about it; beſides, I feared if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, it would be worſe with us upon the account of our Meetings, which I did deſire to keep up. I beg the Lord would enable me to keep the Oath, being taken, as a ſacred Thing. I am yet at liberty, and free from enſnaring Bonds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>15th.</hi> I that Day begg'd the Lord would humble me under any thing of Sin that might be in my Swearing, and taking the Oath the Day before.</p>

                  <hi>16th.</hi> This Day Mr. <hi>H.</hi> acquainted me that one did ſay, That the Lord—would lie heavy upon me; that I was to give a Security by Bond of 7000 <hi>l.</hi> which would ask a great time for me to get, and that I was only Capt. <hi>L</hi>'s Priſoner at large: Well, I find this hint in my Diary that Day, That I can truſt my God who has delivered me, and that he will deliver me ſtill from the Fury and Rage of Men, and the Effects thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>17th.</hi> This Day I had an encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letter from <hi>V.

                     <hi>May</hi> 13, 1686. I met with Stops as to my <hi>London</hi> Journey, by Buſineſs, and my Dear Wife's Illneſs; for this very Day in the Morning ſhe was ev'n ſpent with a Conghing-Fit: I was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from Prayer in my Family, found her very Ill; but, bleſſed be God, ſoon grew better, and told me, I bleſs God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am now pretty well.

               <p>Theſe Letters coming all together, were very ſurpriſing to me; at the ſight of them, I felt a trouble in my Mind, though I had before longingly waited for Tidings from my Dear Wife, whoſe Illneſs I then knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of: I feared to open them, took them up and laid them down ſeveral times before I broke them open, which being at laſt opened, I was overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Grief and Sorrow at the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, being unable to contain my ſelf within due Bounds; my Man not knowing the meaning of it, nor I able to tell him, asked me again and again how all was, and particularly whether his Miſtreſs was well; I at laſt told him ſhe was; for ſhe was got to Heaven, but I was miſerable: I then went to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>L.</hi> who was a hearty ſympathizer
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100468:90"/>
with me in my Trouble; did much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh me, and ſhewed indeed a great deal of Sorrow and Concern beyond Expreſſion. That Night I went not to Bed; next Morning by 6 a Clock ſet forward for the Country; that Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney being the ſaddeſt that ever I took in my Life. I got to <hi>Leiceſter</hi> on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Night, and there met Dr. <hi>H.</hi> by ſending for him, who gave me then ſome of many of the comfortable Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of my Dear Wife's laſt Hours; that ſhe had one grievous Fit, after I was gone to <hi>London,</hi> but through Mercy was well recovered; that ſhe fell into a Relapſe, and was then under diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Symptoms; that ſhe much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſee me, and asked the Doctor, whether he could not give her one Word of Comfort that ſhe might live to ſee me? he told her he could tell her in the Morning: but her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by <hi>Aſthma</hi> and Feaver, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and prevailing upon her; ſhe had ſome Diſturbance, by Temptations from Satan that grand Adverſary of Souls, to queſtion her right to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whether God would accept ſo vile a Wretch. Yet bleſſed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100468:90"/>
be the Lord, through Faith and Prayer, and the never-failing Mercies of a Good God, ſhe got over all, baffled Satan, and was filled with unſpeakable Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. The Doctor prayed with her, and afterward ſhe her ſelf prayed a conſiderable time, diſtinctly and aloud; and for her then Comfort and Support, many Paſſages of Sermons ſhe had heard, eſpecially ſome from Mr. <hi>Coates,</hi> on that Text, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, &amp;c.</hi> came freſh in her Memory, which the Lord helped her to improve to the great Comfort and Refreſhment of her Soul: She was now full of Heavenly Thoughts, and from the abundance of her Heart, her Mouth was now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> She uttered nothing but what was ſavoury, religious and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and being ſpent by great Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, went triumphantly to Heaven, upon the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1686. The Doctor told me it was the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Night that ever he enjoyed in all his Life.</p>
               <p>Here at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> worthy Mr. <hi>Clarke,</hi> the Nonconformiſt, waited my coming, that he might accompany me to <hi>Oller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carr,</hi>

which he did; and the Lord made him mighty uſeful, by his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian advice to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 3. I got home, where I found a moſt ſad and diſconſolate Family; I that needed others to comfort me, was fain to be their Comforter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 5, 1686. This Day my Diary manifeſts that I was grown more calm under the Lord's mighty Hand, and the loſs of a Deareſt Wife; but yet too full of miſerable Complaints, and quarrelling Thoughts againſt my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: the Lord forgive me, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me for the Duties of the Sabbath following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 6. This Day was a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Sabbath with reference to my Enjoyments; but the want of my Dear Wife, occaſioned Floods of Tears and violent Paſſions; the Lord pardon my tumultuous Thoughts, and in the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of my Thoughts within me, let his Comforts more refreſh my Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 7. This Day my Dear Wife was Interr'd at <hi>Crich,</hi> where (if the Lord pleaſe ſo to order it) I deſire and intend to lie by her; the Lord pardon Sins while I had her, and ſuch

as I have been moſt guilty of ſince I parted with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 8. This Day, through Mercy, not much quarrelling with the Lord's Diſpenſations; more calm than I was. O that I could be dumb with Silence, and not open my Mouth in a fretting and repining way, becauſe the Lord has done what's done unto me; the Lord ſanctify this ſad Breach upon me to my Soul's Good. May I remember my Sins that have provoked God, and be humbled for them, and return to the Lord that ſmiteth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 9. This Day I find my Heart better fitted and framed to bear this ſad Stroke.</p>
               <p>This Day was preach'd by Mr. <hi>Coats,</hi> my Dear Wife's Funeral-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, from theſe words, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 4. 13. But I would not have you to be ignorant, Brethren, concerning them which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</hi> Paſſion in the Sermon I was guilty of, when in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory Part, he was ſhewing what a Wife ſhe was; the Lord pardon my unbecoming Carriage to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:100468:92"/>Several days after, I gave account of the Lord's quieting my Mind under the ſad Loſs ſuſtain'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 20. This was a very comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sabbath, and the Lord gave me great Delight under the Droppings of the Sanctuary. Mr. <hi>Coats</hi> preach'd from theſe words, <hi>Hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it:</hi> O! I would fain make application to my ſelf. O that I could hear the Voice of this ſad Providence, and take out the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this Rod! O that I may carry my ſelf like a Chriſtian under this mighty Hand of God! I have cauſe to fear I did not improve Laſt-Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's Mercies as I ought, and God has made this a much more uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Summer.

                  <p>BY a Letter I received Yeſterday from Mr. <hi>Coats,</hi> I perceive the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I ſent you in Town, on Monday Night, were like <hi>Job</hi>'s Meſſengers; one bringing you ſad, the other ſadder News; but I hope you receiv'd the News with <hi>Job</hi>'s Temper or mind, <hi>viz. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord;</hi> and God hath taken away the Delight of your Eyes, and removed her out of ſight, ſhe is in a ſtate of Reſt, and you muſt behold her no more among the Inhabitants of the World; this muſt needs be a preſſing Affliction, to loſe ſo near, ſo dear, and ſo pious a Companion; and that which aggravates the Affliction, is, that ſhe was taken away in your Abſence, ſo ſuddenly and ſo unexpectedly. But, Dear Sir, though God has croſt your Will herein, yet I hope a Tumult doth not ariſe, your Paſſions and Affections
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100468:93"/>
are not in an uproar. Why ſhall not God take away his own, in his own time, way and manner? But, Sir, I am not to teach you; God has rarely quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied you with the Graces of his Holy Spirit, ſo that you know how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and how to reſign a Mercy; you know how to add to Faith, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, as you lately heard. There is an animal Life of a Soul void of Grace, accommodating it ſelf to the Intereſts of the Fleſh, to all ſuch things as are grateful to Senſe; but then there is a Spiritual Life, which is a Principle enabling a Soul to bear up when God takes away our greateſt Comforts; ſuch a Principle there is in you. All I have to do, is to ſympathize with you, and to pray that God would afford you more of the Aſſiſtances of his Holy Spirit, that you may exert that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple now at this time under this Loſs. The truth is, 'tis one of the moſt lovely Sights in the World, to ſee a Chriſtian acting Faith, Patience, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Submiſſion, Reſignation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in times of Affliction; this makes the World ſay, that there is ſomething more in Religion than Talk: but as I
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100468:93"/>
ſaid, I am not to teach you. You have the teachings of the Spirit, which will enable you to improve this Loſs to better Gains. The Lord ſit us all for our laſt and great Change; and in the midſt of our private Loſſes, let's remember the Afflictions of <hi>Sion,</hi> now ſitting in the Duſt. So prays</p>

                  <head>A Copy of a Letter from Coſ. <hi>M. S.</hi> dated <hi>June 17, 1686.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THis Letter ſhould have reached you before this time, and had done ſo but for ſome intervening Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100468:94"/>
I was ſurprized with the report of your Deceaſed Conſort, of whoſe ſo ſpeedy Removal hence, there was to you and me (when laſt together) ſo little Intimation or Preſage. But Fleſh is Graſs, though Souls be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and invaluable; and God knows what he does, and why; he is no ways obliged to let us know what is in the Womb of his Providence, till the Birth be produced; we live to die, and die that we may better know what it is to live; and then beſt know what it is to be, when gone to God. I hope you know how to comport with Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and to be ſilent and ſubmiſſive, and ſatisfied in the great Arbiter of all things. Infinite Wiſdom hath contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Diſpenſations into the exacteſt Order; and he who worketh all things after the Counſel of his own Will, called her home at the right time. Did you and I ſee the beautiful Syſtems of providential Diſpenſations, we ſhould both ſind, and yield, that longer had been too long for her that is gone, to live, and ſooner had been too ſoon to die. What occurs in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29, 31. equally concerns both you and me,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100468:94"/>
though as yet under different Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations: You muſt be as if you had not loſt a Wife, and I as if I had no Wife; Time is ſhort, and Life, and relative Comforts are tranſient and fluid Things; therefore your Sorrows muſt be moderate for your Loſs, and my Joys muſt be as if they were not, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we and ours are to follow, and part, and paſs away in our Courſes.</p>
                  <p>All the Occurrences of our little Time, even boldly challenge from us the Spirit and Poſture of preparedneſs to reſign our All to God. Methinks we are dying whilſt we live; parting while and when we ſeem to meet; and Providence rings Changes all the while that we are paſſing to our Graves. No one's too good to die, too needful to us to be taken from us; or too much endeared or tied to us, to be divorced from us. But O! what wonderful Things has Chriſtianity laid in, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper us to the Divine Will, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us under, and to better us by, even the ſharpeſt Diſpenſations that can betide us here! There are Ties not to be looſed, Relations that know not what it is to die, Treaſures not to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100468:95"/>
be impaired, Regions above ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, ſo richly ſtored, ſo wiſely ordered, ſo freely promiſed, ſo well inſured to us, and ſuch care taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our fitneſs for them, and ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and effectual tranſlation thither under all accents of Solemnity and Triumph, as that we greatly ſhame and wrong Religion and our ſelves, if we prove ſullen o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> deſpondent. When God takes from us our deareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here below, all are ſatisfied, or ſhould be ſo; but all look not through and beyond the Grave; one glance of Things beyond the Vail, though ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len or got by Faith, will eaſily counſel a Chriſtian that under his greateſt Preſſures and Sequeſtrations here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis through himſelf, and his great Fault, if his Joys do not ſurmount and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up his Griefs. But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Worthy Couſin, I much forget my ſelf, I hope for charitable Conſtructions of theſe bold Eſſays: Sympathy and Gratitude, and a Concern for you, make me tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Bounds of Modeſty.

                  <p>I Cannot poſſibly write my trouble for the Death of your Dear Lady, and my moſt intirely Beloved Friend; it's a cutting Stroak indeed, yet muſt be quietly born, coming from the Hand that always acts wiſely and graciouſly for holy Purpoſes and Ends. Certainly the great God afflicts not for his own Pleaſure, but our Advantage, either to expel Sin, deſtructive to the Soul; or encreaſe Graces, the Life, Health, and Proſperity of a Soul. And, Dear Sir, I queſtion not your endeavour to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100468:96"/>
know the Errand, and to purſue the Ends of this ſudden and ſad Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Lord ſanctify it to us all, that as we have certainly loſt one way, we may gain Benefit another way, and learn to place our Happineſs in him, that will never leave nor forſake his; there true Contentment and Felicity is to be found, and no where elſe. I am yet as you left me, but every Hour in expectation of a time of Trial. I beg your Prayers for Submiſſion, Faith and Courage to go through that Work that my Heavenly Father ſhall put me to; may I but have his Preſence and Aſſiſtance, and then I can paſs ſweetly through the Shades of Death: I am wonderfully ſatisfied in the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Death of my Dear Friend, and ſhall prize whatever dropt from her Mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, ſince it has pleaſed the Lord to remove from me a Dear Wife, and Boſom-Friend, and Companion; the deſire of my Soul is to conſider the Errand of ſuch a Diſpenſation, to hear the Voice of this Rod, and know who hath appointed it. It may be this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100468:97"/>
Stroke may be upon theſe, or ſome of theſe Grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may be I was too fond of that Creature-comfort the Lord took from me; for though by my wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments, ſuch Fondneſs could not always be obſerved, yet I had an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire love for her, and could ſeldom bear any abſence from her.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be I did not improve ſuch a Mercy as I ought, whilſt I had it; did not enough give God the Glory of a Mercy he had given me ſo much Comfort in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may be I have been too inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Miſeries of Sin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord has brought this Miſery upon me, that being afflicted my ſelf, I might better know and learn how to comfort others in their Straits, and ſympathize with them in their Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Leſſer Troubles, as that the laſt Summer, and others, have not it may be done that Work upon me God intended them for; and therefore the Lord ſees cauſe to add this great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, of ſtripping me of the beſt Creature-Comfort I ever enjoyed.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:100468:97"/>5. My Carriage to her was too high and peeviſh, apprehending her too little ſubmiſſive to me as a Husband, and too ready to invade the Authority I thought my ſelf to have a Right to; here I might miſtake, but however by it ſee abundance of Pride and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my Nature, the Good Lord humble me for that.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. My not diſcharging, it may be, all Marriage-Duties as I ought, might provoke the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It may be I have done this, in cumbring my ſelf with ſo much world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Buſineſs in bad times, and when I had no need. Now the Lord ſeems to knock me off from ſuch Cumbers by taking from me her that was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſiſting to me in them.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. The very great Unſetledneſs of Preſent-times, and my Obnoxiouſneſs to their Effects, ſeems to call me to a more retired way of Living than here at <hi>Ollercarr.</hi>

               <p>COnſidering the ill uſe you have made of ſome former Advice given you, I have not upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count much encouragement to make further Attempts of that nature; yet knowing that the Work of Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and Converting is the Lord's, and that the Wind blows where and when it liſteth, I may not deſpair but ſome Good (through the Bleſſing of the Almighty) may yet be done upon you. I do indeed purpoſely conceal my Name at preſent, leſt you ſhould deſpiſe or ſlight the Advice, upon the account of the Adviſer, whom you
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100468:100"/>
have too laviſhly and unjuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, though I am confident I have deſerved better Treatment at your hands. But this is not the thing, ſuch Paſſages I can paſs by, yet ſadly bewail them in you, as knowing them to be ſome of the diſmal Effects of your drunken Frolicks; but remember for theſe and the like things God will bring you to Judgment. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that many of thoſe that wiſh you well, have advis'd and reprov'd you again and again, for your ſinful Follies; and would fain have you as well remember that terrible Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, That he that being often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, and hardens his Heart, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroy'd, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Remedy. Wherein you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured me by your Tongue, I can paſs it by. I would not return Slander for Slander, nor anſwer Railing with Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor Reproach with Reproach; I have not ſo learned Chriſt; I can heartily pity you, forgive you, and pray for you, and would now fain perſwade you to be good; and what can be more your Intereſt than to be ſo? Come, Sir, if you have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100468:101"/>
to a dear and tender Wife that lies in your Boſom, to a ſmall Babe, to indulgent Parents, to well-wiſhing Friends, to your own Soul, Body, or Eſtate, but above all, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of a great God, you muſt be good; make a ſtand, conſider, and take up in time. It's my Love to you makes me thus plain with you, for I dare not flatter. Whatever you may think, or however others may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to palliate great Sins, by giving them eaſy Names, Sin will be called Sin, and Wickedneſs Wickedneſs, Drunkenneſs will be call'd Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Sweating Swearing, at the Great-day, and puniſhed as ſuch, and why not now? Repentance is your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that can never be right and evangelical without Reformation. I do believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is your deſire to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy, and can you expect it if you be not holy? <hi>Without Holineſs no one ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. Can you ever expect to get in at the Strait-gate, while you walk in the Broad-way? no, <hi>Strait is the Gate, and narrow the Way that leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it?</hi> O that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100468:101"/>
you may be one of thoſe few! Will you do the Devil's Work, and expect the Lord's Wages? it cannot be; for your Bible tells you, <hi>What you ſow, that ſhall you reap:</hi> and he that cannot lie, hath ſaid, <hi>If you live after the Fleſh, you ſhall die; but if you, through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, do mortify the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi> I am not for inviting you to a Party, or for tying up Salvation to this or that Opinion, but I would fain prevail with you to be good: for be of what Opinion you will, the Scripture warrants me to tell you, That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Strictneſs, Self-denial and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you cannot be ſaved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 42. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15, 16. Dear Sir, as you tender the everlaſting Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of your Soul, do no longer as the moſt, but imitate the beſt, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be a Follower of thoſe who, through Faith and Patience, inherit the Promiſes (or things promiſed.) Forſake bad Company; for you know who has ſaid, <hi>The Companion of Fools ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> Prov. 13. 20. Be you a Companion of thoſe that fear God, and let not the Wicked any longer intice you, or however, prevail with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100468:102"/>
you: for the Scripture is very clear and poſitive in it, That except Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards repent and reform, they ſhall be ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. That except Swearers repent of their prophane Swearing, and reform, they ſhall fall into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>James</hi> 5. 12. That unleſs Liars put away their Lying, and ſpeak every one Truth to his Neighbour, they ſhall have their part in the <hi>Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> Rev. 20. 8. That if Company-keepers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake not the Fooliſh (that is the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and live, they ſhall be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Companions of the Wicked, who ſhall be deſtroyed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. I charge you not, but leave it to your own Conſcience, to conſider how far you are guilty in any of theſe Matters, and then get into your Cloſet, down upon your Knees, bewail before God your ſinful Miſcarriages, and beg a new Heart, and Grace that you may live a new Life; and be aſſured, that what I ſay is out of a ſenſe of your deplorable Condition whilſt you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in your Sins, and a Deſire to ſee you return to that God who waits
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100468:102"/>
to be gracious: Come to Chriſt, and heartily accept him, for he is offered to you. O that I could ſee this great Work done! what a rejoycing would it be to all that are good about you? Then might your Wife bleſs God for ſuch a Husband, who would help her Heavenwards; then would your pious Relations delight in your Society, and your Parents with joy ſay, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Prodigal, <hi>This my Son was loſt, but is found, was dead, but is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <head>A Letter to my Mother, Mrs. <hi>B. D.</hi> upon the Death of her good Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and my dear Siſter <hi>Stany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth.</hi>

                  <salute>Ever honoured Mother,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AT this time I have much Buſineſs upon my hands, and ſome that requires quick diſpatch, otherwiſe my coming to ſee you would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my writing to you; and now I ſhould be ſorry that theſe Lines ſhould add weight to your Sorrows, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Wounds a bleeding afreſh. I am much readier to bear a part of your Burthen, having reaſon enough to be concern'd for, and ſenſible of ſo ſad a Breach as it has pleas'd the Lord to make upon us, by the Death of my dear Siſter <hi>Stanyforth.</hi> Something I would contribute to your Support and Refreſhment, under ſuch a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore deſire your peruſal of the under-written Conſiderations, which has wonderfully ſupported me;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100468:103"/>
the Bleſſing of Heaven render them uſeful to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may and ought to conſider the neceſſity of Dying, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>For we muſt needs die.</hi> Preceding Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made way for us, and ſhall not we make way for others, when God calls?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Friends we loſe are not ſo much ours as God's; God has taken but what he firſt lent. This comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Job,</hi> when amongſt other things he had loſt his Children, <hi>The Lord gave</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God has a hand in the Death of Friends; <hi>My Times are in thy Hand,</hi> (ſays holy <hi>David</hi>) and is there not an appointed time to be upon Earth?</p>
               <p n="4">4. God in the ſaddeſt Paſſages of Providence aims at his People's Good; <hi>All things ſhall work together for them that love God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God is ſtill with us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 1. Though Friends forſake us (through unavoidable Mortality) yet an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God is where he was. There is Sweetneſs enough in God to ſweeten all outward imbittering Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100468:104"/>
Though the Conduit-Pipes, thrô which Mercies were convey'd unto us, be taken away; the Fountain runs ſtill entire in God. May we have a care of doing any thing to dim the Eye of our Faith; for <hi>Hagar</hi> (we read) had a Fountain by, but her blubbering Eyes kept her from beholding it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. How great ſoever the Stroke and Affliction is, we yet deſerve greater; our Sins are heavier than our Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; the Fire of God's Wrath is not proportion'd to the Fewel of our Sins.</p>
               <p n="7">7. God has taken away one great Comfort, but he might have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all; <hi>Shall we receive Good at the Hands of God, and ſhall we not receive Evil?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Conſider the Evil that comes by Diſcontent, and immoderate Sorrow. Diſcontent makes us our own Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. <hi>In Patience poſſeſs your Souls:</hi> by Impatience we are Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of our Sins, and turn'd out of our Underſtandings, Peace, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Too immoderate Sorrow waſtes the Spirits. <hi>Prov. 15. By Sorrow of the Heart, the Spirit is broken.</hi> 2 Cor. 7. <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sorrow worketh Death;</hi> it greatly provokes God. A meek and quiet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100468:104"/>
is in the Sight of God of great price; but a froward, peeviſh Spirit is abominable to him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 20. &amp; 17. 20. &amp; 22. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 26. God may be provoked by this Sin, to lengthen out Miſery, and to adjourn Mercy.</p>
               <p n="9">9. God gives and takes away Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations at his own Pleaſure; let us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praiſe God we have enjoy'd ſuch a Bleſſing ſo long, than repine ſhe is gone ſo ſoon; bleſs we a ſmiting as well as a ſmiling God, a taking as well as a giving God.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Breach made is ſad; but herein God has, (1.) Done us no Wrong. (2.) He has done our dear Friend no Hurt. Done us no Wrong; he has taken but his own, his own by his Creation, by your Donation, by Purchaſe and Redemption, and by her own free Reſignation; And has our dear Father hurt her? Is it to hurt her, to put her to Bed, to throw off her filthy Garments from her, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify her in her own longing Deſire, which was, To be diſſolv'd, and to be with Chriſt, and to enſhrine her in Glory?</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:100468:105"/>11. Think of the Invalidity of Weeping. If Tears could poſſibly bring my Siſter from Glory, would you or any of us have a Heart to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite her from ſo bliſsful a State? Does not the Spirit of God, by ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Scripture, ſeem to ſay to us, as <hi>Judas</hi> ſaid in another caſe, What needs all this waſte? Tears are a good Ingredient for Prayer and Repentance; let's not be too prodigal of them in other caſes. Humanity does allow of ſome Sorrow, but Divinity forbids much. Dear Mother, refuſe not to be comforted; receive the Comforts, and refuſe no longer the Creatures God affords you for the refreſhing and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Nature. Let <hi>David,</hi> I pray, be your Pattern in this caſe: he pray'd for his Child while living; he faſted, he wept; <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who can tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will be gracious to me, and the Child may live?</hi> this I doubt not but you did. But when the Will of God was ſignified in the Death of his Child, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22, 23. <hi>Now he is dead,</hi> ſays he, <hi>wherefore ſhould I faſt? can I bring him back again? I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not return to me.</hi> O that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100468:105"/>
you could do likewiſe! The Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, he wipes his Eyes, falls to his Refreſhments, and ſubmits to God. Let not the want of one Mercy we all priz'd, deprive us of the Comfort of the many Mercies we do enjoy.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If we conſider who we have loſt, methinks our Sorrow ſhould be abated; One who gave moſt excellent Demonſtrations of a good Heart, and a good Condition; one, I truſt, ripe for God, and fitter for Heaven than Earth; one panting for Glory long before ſhe died, and had ſet all in order for Eternity before ſhe was ſick; ſhe long'd to be diſſolv'd, that ſhe might be with Chriſt. Methinks, I ſtill hear her; <hi>Ah,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>how long, O Lord, how long? when wilt thou come?</hi> And to By-ſtanders, (ſays ſhe) <hi>I'm jealous you are conſpiring to keep me longer out of Heaven!</hi> And ah! what a Sight did I ſee in my dear Siſter, when upon the very wing for Heaven, and juſt ready to take her flight. Ah! the heavenly Language ſhe uttered, while ſhe did ſpeak (which was almoſt to the laſt;) and then when ſhe could not ſpeak, the Movings of her Lips, the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100468:106"/>
Pantings of her Heart, the Liftings of her Eyes, and indeed, every Motion of her Body, ſpoke her to have ſtrong Workings of Heart after God, and to be upon the very Confines of Glory. What cauſe of Mourning now? it's our Loſs, but her Gain. She had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good Husband, but now, O now! the Match between Chriſt and her Soul is compleated. Me-thoughts ſhe held my Father <hi>Diſney</hi>'s Hand ſo faſt to the laſt, as if ſhe long'd to take him with her, yet by degrees let go; as if ſhe had ſaid, God has more work for you here, and I can freely let my Hold go of beſt Creature-Comforts, as longing to be in my heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Embraces. I doubt not but to her to live, was Chriſt, and to die, Gain; therefore, well might ſhe leave that to be preach'd on at her Funeral, and as her laſt Legacy to ſurviving Friends, <hi>Weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves and for your Children.</hi> The greateſt Reaſon for ſuch Weeping, preſent times ſeem to prognoſtick.</p>
               <p>My dear Mother, labour for a Chriſtian Carriage under ſuch a Croſs. God's Rod has a Voice as well as his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100468:106"/>
Word; and it's our great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hear it, and him that has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it: Let us ſay, <hi>Righteous, O Lord, art thou, and in very Faithfulneſs thou haſt afflicted us.</hi> Let's not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hard Thoughts of God, but with <hi>Aaron,</hi> hold our Peace, for God has done it. Dear Mother, you know well that ſpiritual Comforts are the beſt Comforts; Is not Chriſt better than ten Daughters, than ten Siſters, than ten Children? Is not his Loving-Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs better than Life? Is there not more in a God, than ever was or can be in a Creature? We have no reaſon to ſorrow as thoſe without hope: She whom we dearly lov'd, is gone to her dearly Beloved; ſhe's reaping the Fruits and Benefits of her Labours in the Lord, and is bleſſed; <hi>For bleſſed are the Dead that die in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Like another <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe choſe the better Part, which will never be taken from her. She is, it's true, taken away in the flower of her Age, and when we moſt expected Satisfaction in ſuch a Relation; but God knew it the beſt time to gather ſuch a Flower. Mr.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100468:107"/>
                  <hi>Baxter</hi> well obſerves, <q>Such have run long enough, who have reach'd the Prize; have ſail'd long enough, who are ſafely harbour'd; and liv'd long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, who are ready to die.</q> We have more cauſe to rejoice, that once we did enjoy ſuch a Wife, ſuch a Child, ſuch a Siſter, ſuch a Niece, ſuch a Friend, to give up at God's Call, than now to murmur that ſhe is ſo ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd; ſhe is (I doubt not) happy. God has preferr'd her to Manſions of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before us; let us prepare to follow. God has call'd home another of your Children, but you are not Childleſs: O take heed by Repining Carriage of provoking God to farther Strokes; but if God ſhould write you Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, you are not yet bereft of Comfort, while the God of all Comfort is yours: If God will not let any part of your Happineſs lie in Children, then let it wholly lie in himſelf. The Love and Delight we plac'd in ſuch a Friend, may now be placed to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Advantage upon Jeſus Chriſt.

very lately heard you reflected upon for ſome looſe Carriages, and that particularly, by one eminent for Grace and Goodneſs, whoſe Name I am o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to conceal; what he acquaints me with, is in Tenderneſs to you, and out of a hearty Deſire I ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove my Intereſt in your behalf.

               <p>I Receiv'd your very kind Letter and Chriſtian Lines, ſome time ſince, and had return'd you my Thanks ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100468:112"/>
had not extraordinary Buſineſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. I have cauſe to bleſs God for your Acquaintance, and for that Chriſtian Society I had with you, whilſt at <hi>London.</hi> O that I could be as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to you in the beſt things, as you have been to me. Poor unworthy Me! who needs jogging Heavenwards. It's with us as with others, a very dark and gloomy Day; but <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous,</hi> (who ſhall reap, if they faint not) <hi>and Gladneſs for the upright in Heart,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks. O that we could be (like the Doves of the Valley) mourning after the Lord, who ſeems to be departing from us. The Sons of Violence with us act high, our Sufferings many; but O that none of theſe things may move us, neither may we account our Lives dear to us, if call'd to lay them down for the Sake of Chriſt and his Goſpel. If the Lord give us but a fixed Heart that we can truſt in him, we need not then be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the worſt times, nor the ſaddeſt of Tidings, but may encourage our ſelves in the Lord our God, under the greateſt Diſcouragements from Men whatſoever. Surely the People of God
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100468:113"/>
have greatly provok'd God. O that we may repent and return to him that ſmiteth! God will certainly ariſe in the behalf, and plead the Cauſe of his People; he will work Deliverance for <hi>Sion;</hi> if not in our time, yet in his: O that this may ſatisfy us. And that when Foundations ſeem to be out of courſe, we may with Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, look up to the Rock of Ages. Dear Sir, pray for us, and for me in particular, who need your Prayers, that my Faith fail not, that I may with Conſtancy and Courage own the good Ways of God, and hold faſt my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, the very deſire of my Soul being to keep cloſe to God: I would fain win as many into Heaven's-ways, and as much ſtrengthen ſuch Hands as hang down, as ſuch an unworthy Wretch as I may. What Intereſt I have at the Throne of Grace, I hope ſhall not fail to be improv'd for the Church of God, and for you my dear Friend. Being, Sir,</p>

               <p>THis Day I receiv'd yours, till which time I was afraid mine to you had miſcarry'd. I heartily rejoice at the Lord's Goodneſs to you and yours; and through Mercy, can give you the ſame Account concerning me and mine, though a ſickly Seaſon in many Places. We have, through the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, of late enjoy'd very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Opportunities at my Houſe; for which, I deſire to bleſs God: But the laſt Meeting we had here, being rather too large, was diſturb'd; the Mayor having notice of Peoples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, ſent his Serjeant, who when the People were diſperſt, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter gone, came in, and deſired Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſearch my Houſe, which (I giving him,) he told me, if upon my word, I would ſay there was no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at my Houſe, he would neither trouble me nor himſelf: I aſſured him

there was none; he then only went into the Garden, where he pretended he ſaw 300; but however, they not being able to make a Conventicle of it, nor a Riot, the Jury found it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Aſſembly; the which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, and I intend to traverſe, for they cannot make out any unlawful Act. The Day is yet dark, and the Sufferings of many great, and Sin at the bottom of all.
