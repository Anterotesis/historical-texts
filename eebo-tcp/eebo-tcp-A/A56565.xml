            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Pastoral Letter
FROM THE
Four Catholic Bishops
TO THE
LAY-CATHOLICS of England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Piscopal Authority, Dear Brethren,
of which You and your Catholic
Ancestors have been long deprived,
being lately, by a merciful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, and the Piety of His
Majesty, restor'd unto you; and
Our Persons, tho' unworthy of such a Dignity,
made choice of to bear the Weight, and undergo
the Sollicitude annexed to it: We have judged it
proper, before We separate Our selves in order to a
discharge of Our Duties in the respective Counties
committed to Our Care, to join in a common Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
unto You All, hoping that what comes thus
directed by an united Application, will make a
deeper Impression on your Minds, and dispose you
to an easier Compliance with the Fatherly Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52833:2"/>
which every one in his particular District
shall think fit to be made unto you.</p>
            <p>Your Condition for many years past hath been
such, as enabl'd you to manifest a stedfastness in your
Religion, rather by suffering for it in your own
Persons, than by contributing actively towards the
planting it in the Minds and Hearts of your Fellow-Subjects.
The Exercise of it hath been private and
precarious, tending rather towards the Preservation
of it in your selves, than a Propagation of it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But now you are in Circumstances of letting
it appear abroad, and of edifying your Neighbors
by professing it publicly, and living up to the Rules
prescribed by it.</p>
            <p>We need not tell you what Obligation you lie
under on this Account, and how unjustifiable your
Behavior will be in the Judgment of God and Men,
if it be not conformable to those Rules, if the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
you enjoy of professing your Religion be
not improved into Practices suitable to the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereof, and if the Truth of your Faith be not
manifested by an Exemplarity in your Lives.</p>
            <p>Charity, which the Apostle declares to be the
End of the Law,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note> is the Vertue by which your Faith
is to operate, and be kept alive: Your Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
may be united without it, but your Hearts
cannot. This latter Union is that which maintains
the former, and renders it useful towards obtaining
the End for which it is bestowed upon you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52833:2"/>
We cannot mind you of this important Duty with
words more expressive of what We desire, than
those which the same Apostle made use of to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
the <hi>Ephesians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> 
               <hi>We conjure you,</hi> as he did them,
<hi>to walk in a manner worthy of the Vocation by which you
are called, with all Humility and Meekness, with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
supportin one another in Charity, sollicitous for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Unity of Spirit in a Bond of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You see of how great Concern this Unity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is unto you, by the care which the Apostle takes
to have it well guarded. You likewise may observe
the quality of the Guard which is set to secure it.
The imployment of ordinary Guards is to secure
Peace, but here Peace it self is appointed to be the
Guard: Peace in the first place with God, by an
entire submission to the Orders of his Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
from which connaturally follows a Peace
within your selves, and a Peace with your Fellow-Subjects.</p>
            <p>As Peace is a secure Guard to the Spirit of true
Religion and Piety,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> so it is by the Apostle ranked
in the third place amongst the Fruits of the Spirit.
The Soul centers in God by Charity, and finding
there an entire Satisfaction, rests in Peace.</p>
            <p>Our Intention in exhorting you to a Practice of
Charity, is not that it be confin'd to persons of your
own Religion: Such confinement would be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of it; for true Charity hath no Bounds.
You must love those of your Religion, because they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52833:3"/>
are so; and others, that as they profess themselves to
be Christians, they may become Members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
Church. You must evidence your Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
these, by an inoffensiveness in your Behavior.</p>
            <p>The memory of past hardships which you have
suffered from some amongst them, may be apt to
create provoking Animosities, and the Liberty you
now enjoy may possibly tempt you to insult over
those who formerly abridged you of it: But it must
be your care to prevent or suppress all such irregular
Motions. You must endeavor to tread in the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of our Divine Master, who was so far from
making such passionate returns, that he did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
even in the height of his Persecutions, to signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
the Excess of his Charity to those who were
guilty of them.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> puts you in mind of this,
proposing the Example of Christ to your imitation;
who, when his Enemies treated him with most out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
Language, was far from answering them in
the same Dialect: When he was provok'd by them
to the highest degree of a just Indignation, he did not
so much as threaten them with the exercise of his
Power.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> The same Apostle leaving us a Character
of true Christians, declares, That <hi>they must be unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
compassionate, Lovers of the Brotherhood, merciful,
modest, humble, not rendring evil for evil, railing for rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but on the contrary returning Blessings to those who
treated them in this manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if in quality of true Christians you ought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52833:3"/>
to live up to this Character; if you ought to make
it good in the most provoking circumstances that
Providence might place you in; what is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from you in these which at present you are
favored with? You are indulg'd a public Exercise
of your Religion; a great part of the Nation, whose
Persuasion in Points of Religion doth differ most
from Yours, and which in time past hath been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
upon your Persons, is willing to enter into a
Friendly Correspondence with you; and if some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do repine at your being Sharers in the Liberty
which themselves enjoy with much greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
the most effectual means to convince them of
their Error, is to edifie them by your good Example.</p>
            <p>You live under a Prince of your own Religion, to
whom, next unto God, you owe this Felicity. You
have his Power to protect you in the free Exercise
of your Religion, and his Example to encourage
your discharge of this Duty in a most edifying man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
His Majesty's assiduousness at the Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and other Functions perform'd in his Chappel,
notwithstanding the multitude of weighty Affairs,
which might frequently excuse him from such At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance;
the respectful Posture in which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
this Religious Duty, and which argues a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Mind no less than of his Body, cannot but
invite you, both as good Catholics and good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to a Conformity with so Eminent a Pattern.
What business can dispense you from discharging
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52833:4"/>
these Obligations, when you see His Majesty under
the Weight of the whole Government so punctual
in His Compliance with them?</p>
            <p>It may seem needless to suggest unto you another
Obligation you lie under, not only of a passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to His Majesty's Orders relating to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but also of an active and chearful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
with Him therein: Your own Safety and
Interest being concern'd in this, and depending on
it, are sufficient Inducements for your endeavoring
to give full Satisfaction in this Point.</p>
            <p>His Majesty hath been graciously pleased not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to favor you with His Royal Protection, but
moreover to honor many amongst you with a share
of the Government under Him. He hath admitted
you to Employments both Civil and Military, from
which by the severity of our Laws you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been excluded: He hath plac'd you in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of manifesting to the World that it was
neither want of Loyalty nor Ability that occasion'd
your former Exclusion: He hath capacitated you
hereby to remove the Prejudices which in former
Reigns your Religion and Persons have lain under.
So that henceforth there will be no reason to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
your being Sufferers, or that your Fellow-Subjects
will be preferr'd before you in manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of public Trusts on these accounts, since Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is no longer a Bar to your Preferment.</p>
            <p>We therefore earnestly desire those amongst you
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52833:4"/>
who are already in Offices, so to behave themselves
in them, that neither His Majesty may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to repent, nor His other Subjects to repine at
the Choice he hath made of them. We exhort those
who are not yet in public Employment, to bear
their Lots with Modesty and Patience, without Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
or Envy. We conjure you all to abstain
from speaking or acting any thing that may seem
to have the least indecent reflection upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
The Councils of Kings are Sacred, as
well as their Persons; and it is a kind of Sacrilege in
Subjects to be too bold with either: Their Duty is,
not to approach their Persons but with respect, nor
discourse of their Councils without submission.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let every Soul</hi> (We speak to you again in the words
of St. <hi>Paul) be subject to Higher Powers; for there is no
Power but of God, and those that be, are ordained of God:
Therefore he that resisteth Power, resisteth the Ordinance
of God; and they who resist, do purchase to themselves Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
What in this Text of the Apostle is said of
Higher Powers, must be understood not only of the
Supreme Authority which is seated in the King's
Person, but proportionably also of that which His
Majesty is pleas'd to impart to His Ministers of State,
and other Magistrates in their respective stations. It
is the King that acts principally in, and by those
Subordinate Officers: His Royal Character being
stampt upon them, challengeth respect from the rest
of His Subjects, and renders their failings therein a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52833:5"/>
Trespass in some measure against Majesty it self.</p>
            <p>Having thus minded you of the general and more
substantial Duties incumbent on you, We do not
judge it either necessary or proper to descend at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to such others as are of a more special Nature:
Occasions hereafter will not be wanting of inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
these, when We enter upon Our respective
Provinces, where We are to dedicate Our Labors to
your Spiritual Improvement, and where We hope
to find such Dispositions, as by rendring Our Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sollicitude profitable to you,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> may make it easie
and comfortable to Our selves. Pray for Us: <hi>And
the God of Peace, who brought out from the dead the great
Pastor of the Sheep in the Blood of the Eternal Testament,
our Lord Jesus Christ, fit you in all Goodness, working in
you that which is pleasing in his sight.</hi>
