            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>She wrought a Sea in one flame full of ships:</l>

               <l>(Like simple marchants goods) <hi>Leander</hi> was:</l>
               <l>For in that Sea she naked figured him;</l>
               <l>Her diuing needle taught him how to swim,</l>

               <l>Scarce could she work but in her strength of thought,</l>
               <l>She feard she prickt <hi>Leander</hi> as she wrought:</l>

               <l>All might be seene beneath the waues to swim.</l>
               <l>In this conceited skarfe she wrought beside</l>
               <l>A Moone in change, and shooting stars did glide</l>
               <l>In number after her with bloodie beames,</l>

               <l>Beneath all these she wrought a Fisherman,</l>
               <l>Drawing his nets from forth that Ocean;</l>
               <l>Who drew so hard ye might discouer well,</l>

               <l>And springs of sweat did in his forehead rise:</l>

               <l>That in his bosome flew and stung him dead.</l>
               <l>And this by fate into her minde was sent,</l>

               <l>And by her lay her skrip that nourisht her.</l>
               <l>Within a myrtle shade she sate and sung,</l>
               <l>And turts of wauing reedes about her sprung:</l>
               <l>Where lurkt two Foxes, that while she applide</l>

being drawne by strange instigation
to employ some of my serious time in so
trifeling a subiect, which yet made the
first Author, diuine <hi>Musaeus,</hi> eternall. And were it not that
wee must subiect our accounts of these common receiued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
to seruile custome; it goes much against my hand to
signe that for a trifling subiect, on which more worthines of
soule hath been shewed, and weight of diuine wit, than can
vouchsafe residence in the leaden grauitie of any <hi>Mony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Monger;</hi>
in whose profession all serious subiects are conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
But he that shuns trifles must shun the world; out of
whose reuerend heapes of substance and austeritie, I can, and
will, ere long, single, or tumble out as brainles and passionate
fooleries, as euer panted in the bosome of the most ridiculous

Louer. Accept it therfore (good Madam) though as a trifle,
yet as a serious argument of my affection: for to bee thought
thankefull for all free and honourable fauours, is a great summe
of that riches my whole thrift intendeth.</p>
            <p>Such vncourtly and sillie dispositions as mine, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
hath other obiects than profit or glorie; are as glad,
simply for the naked merit of vertue, to honour such as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
her, as others that are hired to commend with deepeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

            <p>It hath therefore adioynde much contentment to my
desire of your true honour to heare men of desert in Court,
adde to mine owne knowledge of your noble disposition, how
gladly you doe your best to preferre their desires; and haue as
absolute respect to their meere good parts, as if they came per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed
and charmed with golden incitements. And this most
sweet inclination, that flowes from the truth and eternitie of
Nobles; assure your Ladiship doth more suite your other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
and makes more to the aduancement of your Name,
and happines of your proceedings, then if (like others)
you displaied Ensignes of state and sowrenes in your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;
made smooth with nothing but sensualitie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents.</p>
            <p>This poore Dedication (in figure of the other vnitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

him, my honoured best friend; whose continuance of ancient

kindnes to my still-obscured estate, though it cannot encrease
my loue to him, which hath euer been entirely circulare; yet

               <l>The Nuptials straight proceed, whiles all the towne,</l>

               <l>But the midst holds one to reioyne it euer,</l>
               <l>As common to both parts: men therfore deeme,</l>

               <l>Being authors of sweet peace and vnitie,</l>

               <l>Hath gone with an Ambassadour, and been</l>
               <l>A great mans mate in trauailing, euen to <hi>Rhene,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And then puts all his worth in such a face,</l>
               <l>As he saw braue men make, and striues for grace</l>
               <l>To get his newes forth; as when you descrie</l>
               <l>A ship with all her sayle contends to flie</l>
               <l>Out of the narrow Thames with windes vnapt,</l>
               <l>Now crosseth here, then there, then this way rapt,</l>
               <l>And then hath one point reacht; then alters all,</l>
               <l>And to another crooked reach doth fall</l>
               <l>Of halfe a burdbolts shoote; keeping more coyle,</l>
               <l>Then if she danst vpon the Oceans toyle:</l>
               <l>So serious is his trifling companie,</l>
               <l>In all his swelling ship of vacantrie.</l>
               <l>And so short of himselfe in his high thought,</l>
               <l>Was our <hi>Leander</hi> in his fortunes brought.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5206:50"/>And in his fort of loue that he thought won,</l>
               <l>But otherwise, he skornes comparison.</l>
               <l>O sweet <hi>Leander,</hi> thy large worth I hide</l>
               <l>In a short graue; ill fauourd stormes must chide</l>
               <l>Thy sacred fauour; I, in floods of inck</l>
               <l>Must drowne thy graces, which white papers drink,</l>
               <l>Euen as thy beauties did the foule black Seas:</l>
               <l>I must describe the hell of thy disease,</l>
               <l>That heauen did merit: yet I needes must see</l>
               <l>Our painted fooles and cockhorse Pessantrie</l>
               <l>Still still vsurp, with long liues, loues, and lust,</l>
               <l>The seates of vertue, cutting short as dust</l>
               <l>Her deare bought issue; ill, to worse conuerts,</l>
               <l>And tramples in the blood of all deserts.</l>
               <l>Night close and silent now goes fast before</l>
               <l>The Captaines and their souldiers to the shore,</l>
               <l>On whom attended the appointed Fleete</l>
               <l>At <hi>Sestus</hi> Bay, that should <hi>Leander</hi> meete.</l>
               <l>Who fainde he in another ship would passe:</l>
               <l>Which must not be, for no one meane there was</l>
               <l>To get his loue home, but the course he tooke.</l>
               <l>Forth did his beautie for his beautie looke,</l>
               <l>And saw her through her Torch, as you beholde</l>
               <l>Sometimes within the Sunne a face of golde,</l>
               <l>Form'd in strong thoughts, by that traditions force,</l>
               <l>That saies a God sits there and guides his course.</l>
               <l>His sister was with him, to whom he shewd</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5206:51"/>His guide by Sea: and sayd, oft haue you viewd</l>
               <l>In one heauen many starres, but neuer yet</l>
               <l>In one starre many heauens till now were met.</l>
               <l>See louely sister, see, now <hi>Hero</hi> shines</l>
               <l>No heauen but her appeares: each star repines,</l>
               <l>And all are clad in clowdes, as if they mournd,</l>
               <l>To be by influence of Earth out-burnd.</l>
               <l>Yet doth she shine, and teacheth vertues traine,</l>
               <l>Still to be constant in Hels blackest raigne:</l>
               <l>Though euen the gods themselues do so entreat them</l>
               <l>As they did hate, and Earth as she would eate them.</l>
               <l>Off went his silken robe, and in he leapt;</l>
               <l>Whom the kinde waues so licorously cleapt,</l>
               <l>Thickning for haste one in another so,</l>
               <l>To kisse his skin, that he might almost go</l>
               <l>To <hi>Heros</hi> Towre, had that kind minuit lasted.</l>
               <l>But now the cruell fates with <hi>Ate</hi> hasted</l>
               <l>To all the windes, and made them battaile fight</l>
               <l>Vpon the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> for eithers right</l>
               <l>Pretended to the windie monarchie.</l>
               <l>And forth they brake, the Seas mixt with the skie,</l>

               <l>The Destinies sate dancing on the waues,</l>
               <l>To see the glorious windes with mutuall braues</l>
               <l>Consume each other: O true glasse to see,</l>
               <l>How ruinous ambitious Statists bee</l>
               <l>

               <l>To <hi>Boreas,</hi> that for his <hi>Atthaeas</hi> sake,</l>
               <l>He would some pittie on his <hi>Hero</hi> take,</l>

               <l>But Glorie neuer blowes cold Pitties fires.</l>
               <l>Then calde he <hi>Neptune,</hi> who through all the noise,</l>
               <l>Knew with affright his wracket <hi>Leanders</hi> voice:</l>

               <l>But the curst Fates sate spinning of his death</l>
               <l>On euery waue, and with the seruile windes</l>
               <l>Tumbled them on him: And now <hi>Hero</hi> findes</l>

               <l>Kneeld to it, gaue it drinke out of her eyes</l>
               <l>To quench his thirst: but still their cruelties</l>

               <l>Could not preserue it: out, O out it went.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Leander</hi> still cald <hi>Neptune,</hi> that now rent</l>

               <l>Where teares in billowes did each other chace,</l>
               <l>And (burst with ruth) he hurld his marble Mace</l>

               <l>Anger doth still his owne mishap encrease;</l>
               <l>If any comfort liue, it is in peace.</l>
               <l>O theeuish Fates, to let Blood, Flesh, and Sence,</l>
               <l>Build two fayre Temples for their Excellence,</l>

               <l>Though soules gifts starue, the bodies are held deare</l>

               <l>With searching the lamenting waues for him;</l>
               <l>Like a poore Snayle, her gentle supple lim</l>

               <l>As she would diue beneath the darknes quite,</l>
               <l>To finde her Iewell; Iewell, her <hi>Leander,</hi>

               <l>A name of all earths Iewels pleasde not her,</l>

               <l>Where all ioy was, now shrieke out all complaints.</l>
               <l>Thus cryed she, for her mixed soule could tell</l>
               <l>Her loue was dead: And when the morning fell</l>
               <l>Prostrate vpon the weeping earth for woe,</l>
               <l>Blushes that bled out of her cheekes did show,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Leander</hi> brought by <hi>Neptune,</hi> brusde and torne,</l>

               <l>To filthie vsering Rocks that would haue blood,</l>
               <l>Though they could get of him no other good.</l>
               <l>She saw him, and the sight was much much more,</l>
               <l>Then might haue seru'd to kill her; should her store</l>
