            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>FIrst, That the ſaid Sir <hi>William Cole</hi> had notice of the intended Plots of the <hi>Jriſh</hi> to breake out into Rebellion above a fortnight before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels tooke up Armes, as it is generally given out in <hi>Jreland;</hi> and yet did neither timely informe the State, nor his Neighbours for to prevent the miſchiefe and to defend themſelves.</p>

And when hee had made uſe of their Service neere a yeare and a halfe, when proviſions were ſent him by the Parliament, whereof they expected a ſhare, he caſheer'd foure of the moſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Captaines and their Companies of purpoſe to gaine all the ſaid Proviſions to himſelfe and his Sonne in law Deane <hi>Barkley,</hi> who was his Agent to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for thoſe proviſions.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III.</hi> About the beginning of the Rebellion, there were two Engliſh Papiſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:121092:2"/>
whoſe ſirnames were <hi>Hetherington,</hi> who joyned themſelves with the Rebels, and plundered one Serjeant <hi>Abrels</hi> houſe, a Tenant unto Sir <hi>Frederick,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards burned the Houſe, which was certified to Sir <hi>William Cole</hi> by Sir <hi>Frederick,</hi> with the Depoſitions of certaine witneſſes proving the ſame fact: and it was deſired that Sir <hi>William Cole</hi> would make them ſure for Iuſtice, they being then daily imployed by him, which he refuſed to doe, aleadging that they had done good ſervice to him and afterward ſuffered them to eſcape.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> That whereas Sir <hi>Frederick Hamilton</hi> had taken one <hi>Robert Parck,</hi> one that complyed with the Rebels and had him in cuſtody a yeare and more, and had likewiſe gained the Command of his Caſtle, which was of great advantage and ſervice to the Parliament; and by meanes whereof, the ſaid Sir <hi>Frederick</hi> did daily much ſpoyle and annoy the Rebels: The ſaid Sir <hi>William Cole</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſequence thereof, and how well affected the ſaid <hi>Parck</hi> ſtood unto the Rebels, on a time after that horrid Ceſſation concluded with the Rebels, and when he knew that Sir <hi>Frederick</hi> himſelfe, his Wife and children were gone for <hi>London-Derry,</hi> ſome ſixty miles from <hi>Mannor-hamilton:</hi> The ſaid Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cole,</hi> upon the Marquis of <hi>Ormonds</hi> commands, ſends his Enſigne with <hi>40.</hi> Muſquetiers unto Sir <hi>Fredericks</hi> ſaid Garriſon, and by permiſſion of the ſaid Sir <hi>Fredericks</hi> Lieutenant, who commanded in his abſence, and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with him as it ſhould ſeeme, hee tooke away the ſaid <hi>Parck.</hi> And whereas he was by the ſaid Order to have conveyed him unto <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Dublin,</hi> he firſt feaſted him at his Caſtle, and then returned him backe amongst the Rebels, who received him with all gladneſſe, and after they had rejoyced a while together, they goe along with him to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where afterwards hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures an Order of the State for reſtitution of his Caſtle with whatſoever Armes and goods were in it; which he accordingly obtained in Sir <hi>Fredericks</hi> abſence: Which he and the Rebels now make good againſt the Parliament, to the great prejudice of the Parliaments ſervice, and the danger and hazard of all thoſe parts of <hi>Conaght.</hi> And this done, albeit, the ſaid Sir <hi>William Cole,</hi> well knew that Sir <hi>Frederick</hi> had refuſed to deliver the ſaid Priſoner upon ſeverall Orders and Commands, ſent unto him by the ſaid Marquis for that purpoſe, as well knowing the ſaid <hi>Parck</hi> to be an utter Enemy to the Parliament heere and their proceedings.

               <p>
                  <hi>The ſaid Sir</hi> Frederick <hi>could informe many other particular Omiſſions and Diſ-ſervices which the ſaid Sir</hi> William Cole <hi>hath committed in this time of his imployment, ſince the Rebellion began in</hi> Jreland: <hi>which becauſe they doe concerne himſelfe in a more neere relation, hee ſhall therefore forbeare to mention.

And under colour of going forward with that deſigne, procured the ſaid Maſter <hi>Parck</hi> with 30, or 40 of his Souldiers to accompanie him to <hi>Sligoe,</hi> and when they came neere the ſaid Town, both Maſter <hi>Parcks</hi> Souldiers and thoſe of the Informers entred the Suburbs thereof, and having burned ſome few houſes in it, and received ſome Brittiſh Proteſtants, that eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped unto them from the Rebels, they brought them unto the Informer where he ſtood aloofe, with the ſaid Mr. <hi>Parck,</hi> two of the ſaid reſcued Proteſtants, namely <hi>Iohn Wetherſpin</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Iames Wetherſpin</hi> his Sonne, both <hi>Scotchmen,</hi> were queſtioned by the Informer; wherefore they were amongſt the Rebels.

And then hee not onely ſeized upon and kept his Caſtle of <hi>Newtowne,</hi> putting a Guard of his owne into it, but alſo Plundered, and converted to his owne uſe, all his Money, Plate, Armes, Houſholdſtuffe, Bedding, Furniture, and all other his goods whatſoever, which hee had then aſwell without as within Doores there, not ſuffering his Souldiers to come out of Reſtraint, or uſe their owne Armes, untill hee had unlawfully compelled them, to take an Oath to ſerve as Souldiers under his onely Command.

And afterward their Lordſhips retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſaid <hi>Bryan</hi> unto this Reſpondent, allowing him and his men to be continued upon Protection at <hi>Iniskillin;</hi> Necre unto which Garriſon hee remaines loyall even at this time, but in a moſt miſerable condition for want of Neceſſaries. And this Reſpondent denyeth that ever he did forme the ſaid Protected men into a Company, conſiſting of a Captain and Officers, as in the ſaid ſixth Article is meerly deviſed and ſurmized, but did imploy them under the leading of ſome of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Gentlemen of his Garriſon, upon ſervice many times, with the reſt of his Regiment againſt the Rebels, wherein they were of abundant uſe, aſwell for Spyes and Guids, as by killing and deſtroying the Enemy as effectually as others did; And (for ought knowne to this Reſpondent) did no diſ-ſervice at any time unto the State, in giving Intelligence againſt all or any of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> of their proceedings, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the ſaid Protected men, being taken Priſoners at ſeverall times, by the Rebels, were put to Death for taking part with this Reſpondent.

<pb facs="tcp:121092:7"/>
wherein this Reſpondent and his Captaines, Officers, and Souldiers, are moſt injuriouſly taxed, with often reiterations of unworthy and meane cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards him, for that they did not wait upon him, upon all his calls, which this Reſpondent conceiveth was more then he was bound to doe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to this Reſpondent would ſeeme fit, for the good of the publique ſervice; eſpecially when as at the ſame very times (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was long before the Ceſſation) he was imployed about ſervices of farre greater and better concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Counties of <hi>Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan, Tirone, Donegall, Letrim,</hi> or <hi>Sligoe,</hi> which hath formerly been well knowne both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>And this Reſpondent further ſheweth, that immediatly after the ſaid Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, this Reſpondents Regiment deſtroyed 295 of the Rebels and famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many hundreds of them, and alſo tooke in <hi>Rory mac Gwires</hi> Caſtle, which is now preſerved for the Parliaments uſe; And afwell then as before did reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue, or otherwiſe redeem from the ſaid Rebels 5467 <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and relieved them for many Moneths, out of the ſpoyles gained from the Enemy, untill that in his owne perſon hee guarded and conveyed great numbers of them towards <hi>London-derry,</hi> where further care was taken for their reliefe by the good people there: And ſaith alſo, that he this Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was one of the firſt Collonels of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Regiments in <hi>Vlſter,</hi> which did imbrace and take the ſolemne League and Covenant, which hee humbly conceives will not be deemed to be Omiſſions or Diſ-ſervices, as the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tearmes them: who ſince his comming hither, hath not onely laboured to Defame the Reſpondent, but alſo hath taxed the reſt of the Collonels in <hi>Vlſter</hi> for their Neglects in their ſervice, who (in this Reſpondents opinion) have done much better Service than either of them.</p>
                  <p>Yet did this Reſpondent ſeverall times ſhew his deſires in a moſt effectuall manner to helpe and relieve the ſaid Informer; for having received a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Meſſage from him about the 26 of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1642. That hee, his Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Souldiers, were like to be deſtroyed by Nine hundred of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels that then beſieged him; This Reſpondent immediatly ſent a party of Foure hundred Horſe and Foot for his Reliefe, with Orders that after they had releeved the Informer they ſhould returne within 48 houres; This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent being then threatned to be Beſieged, by the Generall of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces <hi>Owin mac Art O Neille</hi> with 6000 Men. But when the Reſpondents Lieutenant Collonel came to the Informer with this Partie, they found him not at all beſieged nor in no ſuch extremity as hee pretended, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hee ſent this preſſing Meſſage, onely to get ſome of the Reſpondents men with him to take in the Caſtle of <hi>Dromoheare,</hi> which without Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance they could not have effected, though being come, at his importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb facs="tcp:121092:8"/>
they attempted, in concluſion to no other purpoſe, then to deſtroy their Men.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon his Officers and Souldiers returned on the 29. th of <hi>July</hi> from him having received many affronts and abuſes. And on the 20 of <hi>May</hi> following this Reſpondent intending ſome ſervice, in the Province of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght</hi> drew forth about 500 horſe and foot, and Leaguring within two miles of the Informers Garriſon, was importuned with much earneſtneſſe, to come unto him to Chriſten his Sonne, which the Reſpondent (conceiving to be an act of Charity and Chriſtianity) conſented unto, expecting, ſuch civility, as might bee anſwerable to ſo neighbourly an Office. But both himſelfe and thoſe few Officers he carryed with him, received ſuch groſſe diſrcſpect, that he will not defile your eares with the hearing it.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe, God having bleſt the Reſpondent in his journey with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe againſt the Enemy, hee gave him for the reliefe of his Garriſon Two hundred fifty nine Cowes; There going with him in his Journey of their owne accord of the men belonging to his Garriſon, onely 38 Footmen and 12 Horſe.</p>
                  <p>He moreover then beſtowed upon his good Lady 1000 Sheepe, and what he beſtowed on thoſe Gentlemen of his Ladies kindred, and his Officers, who went in a friendly manner with this Reſpondent, the Jnformer ſuffered them not to enjoy, but converted to his own uſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe civilities, which this Reſpondent is moſt unwillingly drawne to mention, he conceived might deſerve more thankes, and not to be himſelfe and his Regiment, exclaimed againſt by the Informer, meerely to render him and them odious, in all places where his tongue gets any credit.</p>
                  <p>In the time of Peace, his carriage towards his neighbours was ſo full of contention, that there was hardly any man of quality or worth neere him, in the Province of <hi>Conaght,</hi> that he had not laboured to injure and oppreſſe, either in their Eſtates or reputations, if not in both, ſo that before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion began, ſuch his carriages made him extreamely diſtaſtfull to men of all conditions, that lived within 20 or 30 miles of him in that Province, which will be evidenced by divers of his Neighbours, of the beſt qualitie, now in this Citie, if they may be called upon for that purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>Theſe be the names and number of the Priſoners, Sir <hi>Robert Hannay,</hi> his Lady, his two Daughters, two Boyes, two men, and a gentlewoman, Maſter <hi>Andrew Adare</hi> and his wife and Siſters Son, Maſter <hi>Alexander Mountgome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> his wife and eldeſt ſonne, Maſter <hi>William Liſton,</hi> his Wife and Daughter, Maſter <hi>Thomas Fullerton</hi> and his Wife, <hi>Patrick Deomand</hi> Mr. <hi>Adares</hi> man.</p>
                  <p>Sir, after the writing of this Letter, we are brought to <hi>Dromaheare</hi> Caſtle, and Order left with the Captaine to bring us unto the Camp at <hi>Mannor-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> where we muſt ſuffer death, if thoſe Priſoners with you be not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>

                           <hi>SIR,</hi> I have received your Letter, whereby I am given to underſtand of your treacherous ſurpriſal notwithſtanding of your ſafe conduct promiſed, for the which I am very ſorry. But ſuch is the trecherous falſhood of thoſe diſloyal Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors generally throughout this whole Kingdome, that hoth made me Vow and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:121092:9"/>
ſweare in the preſence of Almighty God, that I will never give or take quarter, with them or any of them, yea though my own Sons that diſcended from my loynes were in your eſtate, I had rather they ſhould dye gloriouſly for the cauſe of Chriſt, then I ſhould ſo abaſe my ſelfe, as to deale with ſuch Traytors to God and his Majeſty. Thus beſeeching God Almighty to ſtrengthen and incourage you that you may continue conſtant, untill it ſhall pleaſe God to give you deliverance ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by life or death. In the meane time I am perſwaded that they will uſe you with no worſe meaſure, then their Priſoners, who were apprehended by me in the action of Rebellion are uſed, ſo recommending you to God I reſt.</p>

                  <p>And after he delvered this letter unto the Meſſenger, he hanged the chiefe of the Priſoners (being brother to Collonel <hi>O Roirke</hi> who was deſired by this exchange) in the ſight of the Meſſenger before he would permit him to depart, upon whoſe returne to the Rebels they in revenge thereof, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered about 10 or 11 of the ſaid Proteſtants, whereof two were Godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and yet if their mercy, and Compaſſion in the midſt of their Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had not farre tranſcended Sir <hi>Frederick Hamiltons,</hi> they had likewiſe put Sir <hi>Robert Hannay</hi> and his Lady and Children and all the reſt to death.</p>
                  <p>And that his ill diſpoſition may the more fully appeare, he hath with ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and other ill uſage ſo behaved himſelfe, toward his Officers, that his Lieutenant, Enſigne, Miniſter and one of his Serjeants have all forſaken him, ſo that he hath now no Officers, but one Serjeant to Command his Company, at <hi>Mannor-Hamilton</hi> conſiſting of 70 men or thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding all this, the ſaid Informer is labouring for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> and becauſe he conceived he might prevaile in that ſure if his miſcariages were not diſcovered, he moved this Reſpondent, that all the differences betwixt them, might be compoſed by the order of friends, which motion if this Reſpondent would then have accepted, he conceives this information had never beene heard of.</p>
                  <p>And as touching the Government of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> aforeſaid this Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent humbly deſires leave to declare that once it was conferred upon Sir <hi>George Pawlet,</hi> a man whoſe temper in ſome things, was not much unlike this of the Informers, whoſe paſſionate demeanour in his Office, was not onely the occaſion of the loſſe of his own life, but of the loſſe alſo of the lives of many of this Nation there, and the burning of that Towne, with the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a violent (though as it happened) but a ſhort Rebellion in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try thereabouts, which did put the State then, to much unneceſſary expences in the ſuppreſſing of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:121092:9"/>
All which together with the premiſſes, this Reſpondent humbly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as pertinent inſtances, and reaſons to induce the honourable Parliament, not to put the Government thereof into the power of the Informer, whoſe demeanour will never be brooked, by thoſe good people that now inhabit there, upon whom, all the aſperſions that are layd by any late reports or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted letters, (this Reſpondent beleeves) were invented and contrived by the Informer, or his Inſtruments, of purpoſe to make them deteſtablee to this Honourable Parliament, whom this Reſpondent is confident, are as Loyal, and well wiſhing to the Parliament as can be expected, and will really witneſſe the ſame, by their ready and joyfull receiving and obeying of any Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (except Sir <hi>Frederick Hamilton)</hi> that the Parliament will be pleaſed to appoint over them. But his conditions are ſo well knowne unto them, that they will quit their fortunes and ſtations there, which they have hitherto preſerved, with ſo much expence and hazard, rather then ſubmit unto his Command.</p>
                  <closer>And this Reſpondent moſt humbly deſires this honourable Committee, would be pleaſed to pardon him if hee have treſpaſſed upon your Patience, in anſwere to the Charge given in by the Informer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſitated thereunto, for his more ample Vindication, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the diſpoſition of the Informer, which hee hath moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily drawne upon himſelfe, without any provocations given to him, by this Reſpondent. And humbly prayes ſuch reparations as in your Wiſdomes ſhall be thought fit.
