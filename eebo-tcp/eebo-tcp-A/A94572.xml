            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the PARLIAMENT of the Commonwealth of <hi>ENGLAND: The humble Petition of divers Citizens and inhabitants in and about</hi> LONDON,</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat after a long conteſt in this poor Iſland againſt tyranny and injuſtice, (wherein the treaſure of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been exhauſted, and the precious blood of many thouſands ſpilt; wherein the Parliament were forced to ſpend their time for many yeers in maintaining the War, and providing for the defence of their lives, who ingaged in that quarrel) God hath pleaſed (we hope in mercy to this Nation) to bring you together in a time of peace, to heal our breaches, to eſtabliſh firmly the ancient Rights and Freedoms of <hi>England,</hi> which were the ſubject of this great Quarrel (which God hath decided on our ſide) and to ſettle ſuch waies of diſpenſing impartial juſtice, that the Name of God may be exalted in righteouſneſs, and no man have cauſe to repent of the blood and treaſure expended in the purſuance of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioners therefore humbly crave leave to preſent to your Honors their ſenſe of the principal things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that tyranny conſiſted, againſt which we did in judgement and conſcience engage; which were,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The late Kings uſurpation over Parliaments, to prevent their meeting, and diſſolve them when they were met, at pleaſure, and eſpecially under pretence of a Negative voice; His denial and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their ſupreme Truſt to provide in all things for the ſafety and welfare of the People.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His challenging of ſuch an intereſt in the <hi>Militia,</hi> as to command the ſame at his pleaſure without the Parliament; and to place the ſubordinate commands of the ſame in whom he pleaſed: whereby he would have had power to enforce obedience to any of his illegal commands, whether in matters of Religion, or matters Civil, and to have razed out (if he pleaſed) the very name and root of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which have been the ancient preſervers of Engliſh Freedom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His introducing of Arbitrary power to be exerciſed by his Council and others, over mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and eſtates, when they ought to have been tried by the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His challenge of a right (under pretence of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> whereof he would have been judge) to levie Moneys upon the people without their conſent in Parliament; and that in all theſe things he was unaccountable for what he did, either to the Parliament, or any earthly power whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And your Petitioners do further humbly minde your Honours of the many ſignal teſtimonies which God hath given of his diſpleaſure againſt all that have endeavoured to ſupport the aforeſaid Tyranny, or have eſpouſed that as their Quarrel, under any notion whatſoever; and of the price now put into your hands, to ſecure the Nation from future attempts and dangers of the like Tyranny: And not onely the Armies Declarations, and <hi>The Agreement of the People</hi> propoſed by them, (remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Record in your Houſe) but the Ruines and Spoils of the Land, and of many thouſand Families, The expence of many millions of Treaſure, The wounds, and ſcars, and loſt members of many thouſands, and, above all, The precious blood of thouſands of Gods People ſlain in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, cries aloud to you to call to God for wiſdom, that you may be taught and enabled to eſtabliſh ſuch a ſure Foundation of Right, Freedom, and Juſtice, that the People of God might not be put again upon ſuch hazards and expences of their Eſtates and Lives for the defence of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore your Petitioners humbly pray,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That together with the conſtant ſucceſſion of Parliaments (never being entruſted for perpetuity) the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power and Truſt, which the People commit unto them, to make Laws, Contitutions and Offices for the Government of the whole, and to call all Officers of Juſtice, and Miniſters of State whatſoever to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, may be ſo cleerly declared and ſecured againſt all attempts to the contrary, that no queſtion may hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ariſe concerning the ſame.</p>
            <p>That the Militia may be ordered with ſuch wiſdom and ſecutity, that it may not be in the power of any ſingle Perſon, (who may, while he is man, be corrupted) to make uſe thereof againſt the People, or their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Parliaments, either to deſtroy their Being or their Freedom.</p>
            <p>That no moneys may be levied upon the People, but by their common conſent in Parliaments.</p>
            <p>That Wars being now ended, the Peoples Perſons and Eſtates may be onely ſubject to be diſpoſed of accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of the Land, in the ancient way of Tryals by their Equals; that henceforth none may be reputed offenders, but ſuch as ſhall be found tranſgreſſors of the Law.</p>
            <p>And, that as the ſafety of our Religion was concerned in the defence of our Civil Rights, ſo ſuch proviſion may now be made for the encouragement of the ſincere profeſſors of the ſame, that no tender conſcience may be oppreſſed. And in doing theſe things, you will be glorious inſtruments in the Hand of God, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in your Country; And the Lives and Eſtates of your Petitioners will be freely expoſed to hazard in your Juſt Defence.</p>
            <closer>
               <hi>And your Petitioners ſhall ever pray,</hi> &amp;c.</closer>
