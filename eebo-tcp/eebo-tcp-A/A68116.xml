            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And here alſo in the words of my Text: <hi>Behold I bring you good ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great ioy, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>I;</hi> that is, an Angell, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the beginning of the Verſe:<note place="margin">I.</note> 
               <hi>Then the Angell ſaid vnto them, Be not afraid, for behold I bring you good tidings, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Angell;</hi> it is as much as Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: it is <hi>Nomen officij, non naturae;</hi> a name of office, not of nature: as you may reade, <hi>

            <p>Theſe high and heauenly Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were Meſſengers ſometimes of Gods frowne, ſometimes of Gods fauour.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of Gods frowne: as was that Angell that ſlew of <hi>Senacherios</hi>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:14265:7"/>
Hoſt, in one night one hundred foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and fiue thouſand.</p>
            <p>And as were thoſe Angels, that<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 13</note> deſtroyed the Citie of <hi>Sodome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, of Gods fauour: as were thoſe Angels that miniſtred to Chriſt in the Wilderneſſe: For <hi>the Angels came and miniſtred to him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And as was that Angel that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted Chriſt in the Garden: For <hi>an Angell came from Heauen, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted<note place="margin">Luk 22. 43</note> him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as was this Angell, that brings bleſſed newes of the Birth of the Lord Ieſus: <hi>Behold, I bring you good tidings, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The point of this part, office of Angels, is the laſt Verſe of the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes:</hi> Angels are miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter for their ſakes, that are and ſhall be heires of ſaluation.</p>
            <p>And this their office they haue<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> moſt frequently performed, witneſſe the fore-named places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and many other places alſo: As an Angell bade <hi>Eliah</hi> flye from <hi>Iezabei;</hi> and an Angell here brings
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:14265:7"/>
excellent newes from Heauen of the Birth of a Sauiour: <hi>Behold I bring, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Angels are preſent with vs, it is plaine by that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>
                  <hi>Corinths:</hi> Let the women be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, becauſe of the Angels.</hi> The Angels behold the behauiour of man and woman in the Congregation, in the worſhip of God. If therefore women ſhould be ſhorne as man (to whom God hath giuen the hotter and ſtronger braine) it would be a confuſion of Sexes, and a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to the Angels.</p>
            <p>Againe, the office and preſence of Angels is ſéene in this: A man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his Horſe, and trauelleth him, his Horſe falleth vpon him, no bone broken; how commeth this to paſſe? By the prouidence of God, in the watch of Angels.</p>
            <p>This firſt ſheweth the rare mercy of God to mortall &amp; miſerable ſinners, that he will vouchſafe ſuch high and heauenly inſtruments to attend vs in our out goings &amp; in commings, that <hi>we daſh not our foot againſt a ſtone.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 12</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:14265:8"/>Lord, what is man that thus thou<note place="margin">Pſal. 8. 4.</note> ſhouldeſt regard him, or what is the beſt of the ſonnes of men, that thus in mercy thou ſhouldeſt viſit him?</p>
            <p>Secondly, here note the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of the children of God; though they be in baſe eſtéem of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reprobate worldlings, yet they are great in the fauour of the moſt high: yea the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Angels are appointed of God their waiting men: as for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, it is not ſo with them, but the black guard of Hell dogs them, here to ſinne, hereafter to ſinke them to perdition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, here is matter of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the people of God: though man and deuill bee againſt vs, wée néed not bee afraid: the Angels of God ſhall fight our battels for vs: as in Eighty Eight, and as <hi>Eliſha</hi> told his ſeruant, vpon the hoſt of Angels perceiued, <hi>Feare not, for there are<note place="margin">2 Kings.</note> more with vs, than are or can bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs.</hi>

            <p>Whence I note, that it is not a<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> generall report of a Sauiour that makes vs happy; but a particular applyance, that makes vs happy and bleſſed.</p>

               <p>Anointed to be a Prieſt; to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome his Elect, and redeeme them.</p>
