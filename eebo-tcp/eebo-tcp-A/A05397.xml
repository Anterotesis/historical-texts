            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD be mercyfull
vnto vs: For the
tyme is euen nowe
comynge, when as
God muste needes
eyther of his mercy
here in Englande, worcke suche a
wonderfull miracle vnto our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte,
as farre passeth mans expec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacion:
or els of his righteousnes
take such vengeaunce of this land
to the example of all other landes,
as shal be to our vtter distruccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Ye know, that immediatly after
the preachynge of Noe, came the
great floud that drouned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world.
After the warnyng of Loth, came
fyre, &amp; brimstone vpon the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
and Gomorrians. When
Moises had declared Gods thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ngynes
in Egipt, kynge Pharao
and his people were plaged vpon
the lande, &amp; drouned in the red sea.</p>
            <p>Suche plages came euer wher
<pb facs="tcp:3917:3"/>
gods worde truly preached, is not
beleued, receaued, and folowed.
But it the preachyng of Ionas,
the Niniuites repented wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
When the boke of the lawe
was reade vnto Iosias the kinge,
he, with all his people spedely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentynge,
found exceadyng mercy
blessynge, and grace: as lykewyse
all other shalbe sure to find, which
heare the worde of god &amp; kepe it.</p>
            <p>For when Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
had preached the gospell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Iewes, those that beleued
were delyuered frome the curse of
the law, vnto the blessing of grace
out of worldly miserye, to be inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritours
of the heuenly kingdome:
and those that did not beleue, were
cast from god, oppressed of men,
ouercome, spoyled, murthered, and
destroyed of their enemies.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Englande, whyche
at his presente tyme, by reason of
<pb facs="tcp:3917:3"/>
the worde of god set fourth, reade,
preached, and comuned, dothe in
euery place heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Noe,
the warning of Loth, the lawe of
Maises, the threatnings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phetes,
and the grace of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
as it was declared and taught
by Christ and his Apostles: This
Englande muste nedes, either by
beleuynge of these thyngs, obteine
of god wonderful grace of ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,
or els by neglectinge them,
prouoke the vengeance of god, as
a dewe plage and punyshment.</p>
            <p>Take heede therfore England,
for if thou by vnbelefe, let &amp; stop
god from workynge of miracles
to thy comforte, then surely doest
thou prouoke god to powre doun
vengeaunce vpon the, to thy vtter
distruccyon: But if thou doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,
receaue, and beleue goddes
worde, he wyll worke wonderfull
miracles to thy conforte, wealthe,
<pb facs="tcp:3917:4"/>
and prosperitie. Yea, let euerye
man, of what estate or degree so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
he be, grope his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
for if he dooe not there fele
that the worde of God dothe take
place to moue him to repentaunce
and amendment of lyfe, then shall
he be sure sone to haue experience,
that the vengeaunce of God, by a
shameful shorte ende of his wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
lyfe, wyll bring him vnto an
euerlastynge dampnable deathe.
For all those that wyll not crepe
vnder the merciful wings of god,
as the chikinnes of Christ, shal be
caught &amp; deuoured of puttockes,
haukes, and kytes, as a praye for
the deuyll. The wynges of God
be stretched abrode here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
by the kinges gracious ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iestye
and hys honorable counsel,
or mighty power, with ready wyll

            <p>The filthye gredy puttockes,

be supersticious papistes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

as Christ in his owne person dyd

ouer Englande, to crye, to cal, and
to geue warnyng vnto the people
saying as is write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say:
If ye willingly wil heare &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,

            <p>Now your reuerende maiesty,

wyth Christes bloude, and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto your handes, to be

            <p>God be praysed, with thankful

dewe to your gracious maiesty &amp;

<pb facs="tcp:3917:6"/>
that the gredye wolfe of
couetous ambicion, do not creepe
in at your backes: For surely he
wyll doo more harme in a weeke,
then the foxe did in a yere.</p>
            <p>Take hede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vncleane spirit of

For if he returning w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowes,
enter in agayne, then wil he
make the ende of this generacion
to be worse then the beginnynge.
Then shall you leese the rewarde
of your former dilygence, and be
damned for your later negligence.
Then shal the welspring of mercy
which of long tyme hath watered
this Realm with the grace of god,
be closed vp, and the blody flouds
of vengeance gushing out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
wrath &amp; indignacion of God, ouer
flow al togither. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil not god
by workinge of miracles declare

mercy, but by takynge of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce
execute rightousnes.</p>
            <p>But God beyng as mercyfull
yet, as euer he was, if you conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe
as faythful, wise, and dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gente
as ye haue bene to handle
the wolfe, as you haue done the
foxe, to keepe out the denyll, as to
cast out the deuyll: then shall the
people of this la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de feede in quyet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out feare of euyl: then shall
you continuyng to thende, be sure
of an hunderdfold reward in thys
lyfe, and afterwardes, euerlasting
lyfe, iaye and glorye. Then shall
God do wonderfull myracles in
Englande, to declare howe mercy
shall triumphe ouer rightousnes.</p>
            <p>And that wee maye all dyspose
our selues the more conuenientlye
for god to worke suche a miracle
amonge vs, wee haue appoynted
for the gospel of this day, wrytten

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Mercyfull Lorde, what a

to do them good, by theyr own vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes
&amp; misusinge of the same
doth encrease theyr greuous daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

hauing great occasion of comfort,
by reason y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in this place, throughe
the true preaching of gods worde,
al sinne is playnly and frely rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and those thinges especiallye
whiche dooe appertayne vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gystrates,
wherby anye man of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
iudgemente, maye thinke
that these magistrates beinge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente,
and willingelye hearynge, be
purposed to amende: These peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
I say, that thus haue a greate
occasion of comforte offered vnto
them, by theyr owne mistakinge of

gryefe and daunger. For they
speake vnreuerently, and vntruly
slaunder the magistrates, not only
with the faultes that bee here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but also with rebukynge, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoninge,
and forbiddinge of the
Preachers. And when as by the
same mouth of the true preacher,
theyr venemous tounges be rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they spare not to say, that
the Preacher hath learned his les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in Iacke an apes court: doing
as much as lyeth in them, to make
other men, neither to reuerence the
magistrates, nor beleue the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.
What they them selfes mean
thereby, peraduenture by reason
of blyndenesse; they wot not. But
we knowinge the craft of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
as Paul writeth .ii. Cor. ii. per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue
that he would haue nothing
in thys place layed to the Rulers
charge: Not fearynge howe muche
be spoken to those of the people,
<pb facs="tcp:3917:10"/>
whiche be past any amendment by

is lest that the rulers be put in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce
of the greate daunger
that thei be in, for suffring to great

the people.</p>
            <p>I therfore trusting to do most

laye great and many fautes vnto

For sure I am, that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
ordeyned of God to see the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunte

Gods vengeaunce, for the greate

do grow and spryng of ignorance
for lacke of knowledge, &amp; of disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutenes
for lacke of due correccion.</p>
            <p>And you people be ye sure that
the more theyr daunger is, for lack

<pb facs="tcp:3917:11"/>
other mens faultes, the greater is
the damnacion of them that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit
and do these faultes.</p>
            <p>Nowe I trustinge to God, and
not fearinge the deuyll, wyll pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceade
to declare and applye thys
parte of scripture vnto thys Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyence,
so that for no man I wyll
cloke or flatter any vyce.</p>
            <p>Iesus lyftnge vp hysepes, and seinge
muche people cummynge vnto hym. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here note two thynges: in the
people note co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minge vnto Christ,
and in Christ, note charitable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
for the people. For in thys
people dothe Christ declare by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
&amp; proue in experyence hys
doctryne to be true, whiche he had
afore taught, sayinge: Fyrste seeke
for the kyngdome of God and the
ryghtuousnes thereof, and al these
other, meaninge necessaryes, shall
be ministred vnto you. For here
they folowinge Chryst, to seke the
kyngdome of God, had not only
<pb facs="tcp:3917:11"/>
this kingdome of God, this bread
of lyfe, thys worde of saluacion

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully

            <p>Yea the plentye of these people
hauinge inoughe euen so muche
as they woulde, was farre more
then the plentie of crafty Lawers,
disceitful Merchauntes, couetous
greedyguttes, &amp; ambicious prol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
whiche canne neuer haue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
but alwayes continewe in
vnsaciable hunger, and nede of
couetousnes. As the .xiiii. Psal. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth:
<hi>Diuites eguerunt:</hi> The riche
haue felt nede &amp; hunger: but they
which seke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord lacke no goodes.</p>
            <p>He that seeketh to be ryche, be
he neuer so poore a slaue, or so
myghtyea Lorde, he falleth into
dyuers temptacions and snares of
the deuyll: but they that seeke the

            <p>Seeke for to be rich, &amp; thou shalt
fynd sorow, mysery, and mischiefe:
Seeke for to be godlye, and thou
shalt find coufort, welth, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie,
with al maner of felicity.</p>
            <p>If thou wilt be godly, thou must
folowe Chryst: thou must not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the steppes of hys fete, which
be taken vp into heauen out of
thy syghte, but thou oughtest to
folow the doctryne of hys worde,
which is here left vpon carthe, to
guyde the steppes of thy lyfe, in
the way of peace. And whyther
wyll goddes word gyde the in the

Surely vnto the Lorde, whych
saith: <hi>Propter miseriam inopum. &amp;c.</hi> For
the miseryes sakes of the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
and syghynges of the poore,
now wyl I ryse, sayeth the Lorde.</p>
            <p>O Lorde, seeynge thou haste
manye people in Inglande, that
<pb facs="tcp:3917:12"/>
as yet be in myseryes without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and in pouertye, and lacke

in the .xxxiiii. of Ezechiel:
<hi>Suscitabo super eos pastorem unum. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wyll set vp ouer theym one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
euen my seruaunte Dauyd, he
shall feede theym, and he shall be
theyr pastor, and I the Lord wyll

was wrytten longe after Dauids
tyme. Wherefore by Dauid here
named, is sygnyfyed and meante
suche a Kynge as shalbe as fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and diligent to kepe, feede, and
cherysh hys subiectes within hys
owne Realme, as was Dauid to

hope, truste and beleue, that oure
gracions Kyng, indued wyth the
faythfull diligence of Dauid, is
ordeyned of God, to gouerne,
cherish and feede vs the people of

thys his realme. Wherefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge
to the example of Chryst
Iesu, most Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Gracious
Kynge, for the reuerence of God,
which hath set you vpon the hygh

pitie, and behold muche peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
througheoute all Englande,
comminge to seke reliefe, ease and
comforte, sente frome God vnto
them, by your excellente Maiestye.
For althoughe there hathe bene to
much mercy shewed vpon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracion
of vypers, the vngraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
rebelles: Yet is there manye
poore people, whiche lyke symple
sheepe, shorne to the bare skynne,
haue as yet lytle prouision &amp; great
neede. Euen as .v. thousandes in

Apostles, so manye thousandes in
Englande, past all other hope and
refuge, folowe your gracious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestye
<pb facs="tcp:3917:13"/>
and honourable Counsel.</p>
            <p>For theyr parsons, whiche should
lyke shepheardes feede them, doo
lyke theues, robbe, murther and
spoyle them. And theyr landlordes
which shuld defend them, be moste
heauye maisters vnto them: Yea,
all maner of officers doo not theyr
duties to kepe the people in good
order, but rather take such fees as
maketh the people veraye poore.
Who so hathe eyes, and wyll see,
may easely perceiue that those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages,
which be most in number
and greateste in value through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
al Englande, be no shepherds
houses to laye vp fodder to feede
the poore shepe of the parysh, but
theeuysh dennes, to conuey awaye
great spoyle from all the rych men
of the parysh. I say ther is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
there, to releue the poore &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with natural sustinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge
of house, and to fede all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generally
<pb facs="tcp:3917:14"/>
with the heauenly foode
of goddes worde by preachinge:</p>
            <p>But there is a persons deputy or
fermer, which hauing neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitye,
power, nor authorytye to
doo the persons dutye in feedyng
and teachinge the parish, is able,
sufficient, and stout inough to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
and take for hys maysters
dutye the tenth parte of al the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysh.
Likewise other officers take
many fees, and do few dutyes: And
especiallye landlordes take excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
fynes and rentes of theyr
tenauntes, and doo no good vnto
theyr tenauntes.</p>
            <p>Now my Lordes, bothe of the
laitie and of the clergy, in the name
of god, I aduertyse you to take
heede: for when the Lorde of all
Lordes shal se his flocke scattred,
spylte and loste, if he folowe the
trace of the bloude, it wyll leade
him euen streyght waye vnto thys
<pb facs="tcp:3917:14"/>
court, and vnto your houses, where
as these great theues which mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
spoyl, and destroy the flockes
of Chryst, be receyued, kept, and
mainteined.</p>
            <p>For you maintain your chaplens
to take Pluralities, &amp; youre other
seruaunts mo offices then they can
or wyl discharge.</p>
            <p>Fye for synne and shame, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gyue your seruauntes wages,
or els let them go and serue those
which do gyue them wages. For
now your chaplaynes, your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts,
&amp; you your selues haue the
persons, the shepherds, &amp; the offy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
wages, &amp; nether you nor they,
nor other doth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> persons, the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
or the officers duty, excepte
peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture ye imagin that ther is
a parishe priest, curate, which doth
the persons duti. But although ye
do so imagin, yet the people do feel
and perceiue that he doeth meane
<pb facs="tcp:3917:15"/>
no other thing but pay your duty,
pay your dutye. Yes forsouth he
ministreth Gods sacramentes, he
sayeth hys seruice, and he readeth
the homilies, as you fyne, flatring,
courtiers, which speake by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion,
tearme it: But the rude
lobbes of the countrye, whiche be
to symple to paynte a lye, speake
foule and truly as thei finde it, and
saye. He minisheth Goddes sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
he slubbers vp his seruice
and he can not reade the humbles.
Yet is there some that canne reade
very well, but how many of those
be not either supersticious papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,
or els carnall gospellers, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
by theyr euyll example of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng,
and worse doctrine, do farre
more harme then they do good by
theyr fayre reading &amp; saying of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.
But put the case, as it maye
be, that there be at a benefyce in
some place at somtime, some good
<pb facs="tcp:3917:15"/>
curate, all those summes wyll make
but a feewe in number, and yet
ye see many persons in manye pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
absente from theyr benifices,
whiche if they be seldome absente,
may be good, but if they be conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
or for the most part absent,
then can they be neither good, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
nor godly. For if theyr dutye
be vndone, then can no man excuse
them: if it be done, then is it by other
and not by them: and then whye
dooe they lyue of other mennes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures?
He that preacheth the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
shoulde lyue vpon the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
as God hathe ordeyned: As
for those, <hi>Qui mollibus uestiuntur, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mibus
Regum,</hi> whyche goo gaye in
Kynges houses, and either mosell
the labouringe oxe, or els spoyl the
poore parish in the country, be of
the deuyls ordynaunce. As there
is in all offices some putte in by
Chryste, some by the deuyll: so is
<pb facs="tcp:3917:16"/>
there in personages, some sente
from Chryst as shepherdes to fede,
&amp; some from the deuyll, as theues
to deuoure. Yea amongest all
kyndes of offycers, some be true
Prophetes and sheppeheardes in
dede, and some haue shepe skynnes,
and be raueninge wolues in dede.
The one taketh paynes in doyng
of hys dutye, and the other seketh
gaynes in professyng of hys duty.
Take heede of those, for they are er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt
theeues.</p>
            <p>Alas, if all those whiche take
the names and professyons of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fycers,
for desyre of luker and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and do not execute the dutyes
belonginge to theyr offyces wyth
painful diligence, be errant theues
as they be in deede, then is ther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
a strong erraunt theefe amongst
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be called honest, worshipful,

            <p>For they haue the names, the

authorytyes &amp; vauntages of those
offyces gyuen &amp; payed vnto them,
the dutyes of the whyche be verye
slenderly or nothyng at al executed
amongest the people.</p>
            <p>If I were in anye other place
in al England, I could and wold
vse another trade of preachynge
afore another audience: but beinge
called of God by your appoynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vnto this place at this tyme,
my conscience doth compell me to
vse this trade and no other, afore
this solemne audience. Wherfore
with dreede and feare of God, with
charitable pyty of the people, with
moste reuerend loue and homage
vnto your honors, I muste needes
cry wyth the Prophete Esaye:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Principes Sodome, populus Gomorre:</hi> 
               <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g>
Heare the woorde of the Lorde ye

<pb facs="tcp:3917:17"/>
the great number of your sacrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Dicit Dominus,</hi> sayth the Lord:
rebukyng all the sacrifices, Ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes,
and feastes of the Iewes
which he him self had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be obserued and kept: by
the which thyng left in wrytyng
he doth teach and commaund me
how to speake of your well doyng
here in England. Heare therfore
ye Prynces of Sodome, and ye
people of Gomor, thus sayth the
Lord: What pleasure haue I, yea
what care I for all your Englysh
Bibles, Homelies, &amp; all your other
bookes? set forth no more godly ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uice
to honor me wyth: I hate them
al wyth my herte, they are greuous
vnto me, I am wery of them: Yea,
it is a great payne for me to suffer
them. Why, O Lord these be good,
these be godly, and these be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye

            <p>Truthe it is, the faulte is not in

the things that be set forth, but in

            <p>Your handes, your seruyce and
your houses be full of persons li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynges
preachers liuinges, and

the person hath his dyspensacion,
the preacher is put to scilence, and
the offycer vnpunyshed, for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectynge

through the negligence of the ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers

whych you haue cheryshed &amp; kept

            <p>Thus hath God by Esaye in

described Rulers Faultes, wyth a

<hi>Principes Anglie:</hi> Ye heade Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers

your owne faultes: and then, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usynge

by doynge dutyes, and how many

ye perceaue that there must nedes
be manye sheepe, that wyth theyr

do folowe the Kynges Maiestye,
and you of hys honorable counsel
so farre past the houses and cities
of their owne prouysion, that if
they haue not spedy reliefe at your
handes, manye of theim is lyke to
fainte and decaye by the way.</p>
            <p>Therfore thys considered and
knowen, as Christ liftinge vp his
eyes dyd teach you to see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder
the people: so learne by that
whiche foloweth in Christes doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge,
what shalbe your dutye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that ye se and knowe the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
the state and condicion of
the people.</p>
            <p>And he said vnto Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyp:
<pb facs="tcp:3917:20"/>
From whence shall
we bye breade, that these
maye eate? But thys he
sayde to proue hym: for he
hym selfe knewe what he
would do.</p>
            <p>Christ said to Philip as euerye
Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Kyng ought to say to his
Counsell: From whence shall we
that be gouernors kepers and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
bye &amp; prouyde with our own
costes, labor, and diligence, bread,
foode and necessaryes, that these
may eate and be relieued, which be
our subiects in obedience, brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in Christ, and felow heyres of the
heauenly kyngdome?</p>
            <p>Pharao wyth Counsell in
Egypte, consulted howe to bryng
the welthy people vnto misery: so
that he is a very Pharonicall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
whych laboureth by oppressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:3917:21"/>
to thrust down the welthy people:
And he is a faithful christen king
that humbleth him self by dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to releiue, conforte, and set vp the
afflycted people. For the one, by
worldly policy, would haue much
honor, and the other of godly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
wil do much good. Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
said this, to proue and trie Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,
knowyng him self what shuld
be done. So that here, Kynges
and great men may learne to trye,
and proue the honestie, wit, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie
of theyr Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sellers, in such
matters as they them selues be so
perfect that they can diserne wyth
what discrecion and mynd the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seller
doth answere.</p>
            <p>Philip au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swered, that
two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth peny worth
of breade wyll not serue
vnto these, so that euerye
one myghte take a lyttell</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3917:21"/>
In the which answere, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernynge
his witte, he declareth it
to be to slender to prouide for so
great a matter in so short tyme.</p>
            <p>And hys mynde semed to be suche
as would not haue Christ to trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
hym selfe wyth so great cares
but rather as the other Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes
do declare, to sende the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
away, and let them <gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for
them selfes. The same minde and
affeccion was in Peter, after that
Christ hadde tolde hys Disciples
howe that we must go to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
to suffer sore paines and mise<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable
death. For then Peter tooke
hym a syde and sayde: Mayster
fauour your self, doe not enter in
to such daunger and sorowes.</p>
            <p>And it is not vnlyke, but if youre
Magestye, wyth youre Counsell
speake vnto youre nobles for pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uision
now to be made for the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple:
ye shall fynde some that bee
<pb facs="tcp:3917:22"/>
Philippians and Peters, whyche
by settynge afore youre eyes the
hardnes of the matter, the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of your yeares, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
charges that should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
wyl moue and counsel you
to quyet youre selfe, to take youre
ease, yea to take your pastime, in
haukyng, Huntyng or gamnyng.
Unto whom your Magestie may
aunswer, as Christ dyd vnto Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Auoyde fro me Sathan, thou
hyndrest me by thy carnall temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion,
to doo that thyng whyche
God hath moued me vnto by hys
gracious inspiracion. Thou hast
no tast nor sauour howe delicious
God is vnto a pure conscience, in
Godly excercise of good worckes.
But al that thou regardest &amp; felest
is voluptuous pleasure in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vanities. And therefore y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> doest
not perceiue, how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which be
indued with a special grace of god
<pb facs="tcp:3917:22"/>
may fynd more pleasure &amp; pastime
in godly gouernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to kepe togi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
&amp; saue simple me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then in hau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king
and huntynge, to chase and
kyll wylde beastes. Yea, a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kyng shall finde more pleasure
in castinge lots for Ionas, to trye
out offenders, whiche trouble the
ship of his commune wealth, then
in casting dice at hasarde, to alow
&amp; maintaine by his example, such
thynges as should not be suffered
in a commune wealth. Yea surely,
a good King shal take farre more
delyte in edifiynge wyth conforte
and deckynge wyth good order
the Congregacion of hys people,
the Churche and house of God,
the heauenly Citye of Ierusalem,
then in buildinge suche houses as
seeme gaye and gorgeous, and be
in deede but vyle earthe, stones,
tymber and claye. Suche lyke
aunswer ought your Magestye, &amp;
all noble men to make, if ye fynde
<pb facs="tcp:3917:23"/>
any of your Counsellers more car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal
than spiritual, more worldlye
then godly. Or els tourne awaye
your eares from such Philipians,
&amp; heare other, as Christ did.</p>
            <p>Then saide vnto him
one of his Disciples, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
Simon Peters bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Ther is a boye here
that hath fyue barely loa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues
and two fyshes, but
what auaile those amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
so manye?</p>
            <p>Note here that this boye was
the Apostles page, &amp; these loues
and fishes were their vittayles.
For as appeareth in Marke, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thei had made search howe manye
loaues they them selues had, thys
answere was made, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had .v.
loues &amp; .ii. fishes: but what be they
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest so many? As who should
<pb facs="tcp:3917:23"/>
say: although these be al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer we
haue &amp; seme more mete to be kept
amongest a few, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be giuen to
many, yet for because thei y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> becum
whyche beynge many haue more
nede then we: therefore ar we wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>linge
to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be disposed, &amp;
wish y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were of more value to
do more good amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people.</p>
            <p>These men cared more for the
Commune people, then they dyd
for them selues, and therfore were
very mete to be Counsellers, and
neare about a great Kyng.</p>
            <p>Here we perceyue what sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Phylippe, and good Andrewe
thinke, but here is nothyng decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
of couetous Iudas counsell.
No, for Christ beynge fully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to doo a good deede doeth
neither aske, nor heare anye coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of couetous Iudas: teachyng
all them whych intende any good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,
neuer to aske nor admit anye
<pb facs="tcp:3917:24"/>
counsel of those whom they know
to be couetous. For truely the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
mans councel, although it
seme neuer so good and honest, yet
is it in dede nought and deuilish.
For what could seme better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a litle ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the swete
smel of the whyche continued but
a while among a few, should haue
ben sould for thre hundreth pence,
the greate price of the whyche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
amongeste manye poore,
should haue done them good for a
great season?</p>
            <p>The Euangelyst doeth shewe
howe that Iudas dyd gyue thys
counsell, not for that he had anye
care of the poore, but bycause he
was a thefe, and bare the bagges.</p>
            <p>Iudas pretence was wonders
godlye, to sell the oyntmente for a
great summe of moneye, to relieue
the poore wyth, but hys purpose
was deuelyshe, to get the mony in
<pb facs="tcp:3917:24"/>
hys bagges, and kepe it to hym selfe.
And those in England why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
dyd pretende, that besides the
abolishinge of supersticion, wyth
the landes of Abbeys, Coliges
and Chauntries, the King should
be enryched, learnynge mayntay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
pouertye relieued, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
wealthe eased, and by thys
pretence purposely haue enriched
theym selues, settynge a brode in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloystered
papistes, to get their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges
by giuing them pencions,
yea, and thrustynge them into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
to poyson the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
welth for the risignacion of
those pencions: &amp; so craftly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lerning
from pouertye, &amp; from al the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
wealth, vnto their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
vauntage: These mennes
counsell semed better then Iudas
counsell was: and their couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
by their owne deedes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="tcp:3917:25"/>
no lesse then Iudas couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
dyd. Well, beware, for if ye
play Iudas part on styll, &amp; make
no restitucion, vntil ye go to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng,
ye are lyke to fynde despera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
at the end of your life, because
ye wold not by restitucion amend
your life. Ye noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; especialli
you of the kings cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
of God, pitie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men
wealth, and safegarde of your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes,
awaye wyth these Iudasses,
let them go hange them selues: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
perauenture ye thyncke it
fytte and necessary, that you fyrst
hang them afore thei betray you.
For vndoutedly, he that hath the
couetousnes of Iudas in his hert
he wyll playe all the other partes
of Iudas, if he euer haue suche
oportunitie as Iudas had.</p>
            <p>A way with Iudas, and learne at
Andrew, to saye vnto thys kynge
and his councel intendynge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue
<pb facs="tcp:3917:25"/>
the multitude of hys people
here in Englande, learne ye noble
men to saye: Here is a boye, Here
be seruauntes and retayners of
oures whyche haue fyue loaues
and two fyshes, manye benefices,
some prebendes, wyth dyuers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyces:
yea, and some of vs our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
haue mo offyces then we can
discharge. Pleaseth it your maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
to take these into your hands,
which haue bene kept for vs, that
they now in thys great nede, maye
be better disposed amongest youre
people. <hi>Quid hec inter tantos?</hi> These
be verye small thynges towardes
the amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of so many lackes
in so great a multitude. How be it
these wyl serue, so that there maye
be mo good Persons, good prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and good officers placed a
brode in euery countrye, which in
doing theyr offices, keping of hou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses,
and preachyng of gods worde
<pb facs="tcp:3917:26"/>
may teach the ignoraunte, relieue
the poore, punyshe the fautye, and
cheryshe the honest, and so repayre
the pale of good order about thys
comen welth. For the loue of God
giue your seruauntes wages, and
cause the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to restore these liuinges,
whych coming of the sweate of the
labourer, be in dede the relife of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
poore, the mayntenaunce of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stye,
and the reward of vertue, yea
the verye pale, wall, and bulwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
of the commen wealth. The
Apostles gaue all that they had
of theyr owne, freelye vnto other:
stycke not you to restore that now
whych ye haue of longe tyme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably
kept from other.</p>
            <p>Heare what foloweth: whan these
fishes &amp; loaues were broughte vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
Iesus, make (sayth he) the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to sit downe. God alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
his benefites vpon theim
that sit doune in quietnes, &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="tcp:3917:26"/>
furth hys ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those
that be vnpacient, vnquiet, &amp; full
of businesse. For as appeareth in
Genesis, the people gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the playne of Sanner, &amp;
made a greate vprore, buildyng a
tower lyke rebels agaynst god, to
get the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a name. Howe be it god de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied
their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyworke, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
theyr la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gage, &amp; scatered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abrod.</p>
            <p>The Scribes &amp; the Phariseys
came vnquietly, temptyng Christ,
and required a sygne from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Christ rebuked them sharply, and
shewed them no sygne, but called
them a frowarde and aduoutrous
generacion. So the people in
England gathered together, they
woulde make maisteryes, and bee
notable felowes: yea, the towre of
theyr presumpcion shuld be built
vp vnto heauen, in dyspite of gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyll
men and nobilitye: they haue
partlye felte, and we haue ryghte
<pb facs="tcp:3917:27"/>
pitifully sene howe sore God was
therwith offended. Nowe I heare
saye there is as yet remaininge in
Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d sum stiffe necked Iewes,
which come presumptuously tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
God, and say: if these our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
be sent of God, to take better
order then other haue done, well
then, let theym begynne betime to
gyue vs a notable sygne &amp; token,
for els we wyll not beleue, truste,
nor obey them.</p>
            <p>Wel, I wyl tel you that thus
whysper: Euen as Christe was
<hi>Positus in resurreccionem et ruinam mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum
in Israell:</hi> Set to restore and
decaye manye in Israell: So be
Christen rulers in euerye comune
wealth, set and ordayned of God,
to beate doune &amp; kepe vnder these
sturdye rebels, whyche be so euyll
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, that they cannot thinke
that any man doeth intende to do
them good, &amp; to rayse vp, conforte
<pb facs="tcp:3917:27"/>
and cherish the simple pacient peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple,
whyche be of a good truste to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
theyr rulers, knowynge
that they theim selues haue deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
no euyll: or els if they haue
done euyl, yet by repentaunce and
amendemente, do not doute to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
mercye at theyr rulers han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
So God hath ordeyned ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to cheryshe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, if thou be meke
quiet and paciente, or els to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshe
the, if thou be vnquyet, busy
and stubborne. Learne at Paule.
Rom. xiii. If thou do wel, to trust
well of thy rulers, and if thou doo
euyll, not to be wythoute feare of
theyr powers, for he beareth not
the swerde wythout a cause. Take
hede therefore ye rulers, for gods
sake, and pitye of people, seynge
that God hath geuen you a swerd
to cut of rotten cankred members
for the safegarde of the hole body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
knowyng no ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ker to be so daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb facs="tcp:3917:28"/>
as rebellion in a commen
wealth: If ye fynde one person in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
wyth that canker, awaye
wyth him, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> safegard of the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye
of that house. If one house be
infected, away wyth it, for the safe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>garde
of that toune. If the toune
be infected, awaye wyth it, for the
safegarde of the contrey. Yea, if a
shyre or contrye be all poysoned,
awaye wyth it, for the pitye, and
safegarde of the hole bodye of the
commen welth. So ye se, that the
sharper that youre sworde is, and
the sooner that ye strike rebellion,
the more pyty shewe ye in cutting
away the lesse, and sauynge the
more part and porcion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
beynge all of one bodye, of one
realme and common welth. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that Chryste wente from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
vnto wildernes, to drawe
the Gentle people from amonge
the stoborne scribes: and so Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
<pb facs="tcp:3917:28"/>
rulers muste nowe nedes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the tyme to drawe the people
that be good and trust well, from
amonge this frowarde generaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whiche of presumption loke to
haue order taken as they require,
and appoynte the tyme, the place
and the thynge. Wherfore, ye that
be good quiet people, beware of
these busye felowes, and as thys
multitude whiche oughte to be
youre example, folowed Chryst in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
the wyldernes, so folowe you
Christen rulers, goddes offycers,
youre chiefe gouerners in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande.
And as they dyd not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
sayinge: why shall we sitte
downe here in the wyldernes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
an infinite number, where no
meate is, seynge that in the cityes
where was more meate, and lesse
gatherynge of the people, we had
neuer feaste gyuen of hym by hys
Apostles?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3917:29"/>
So I saye, do not you grudge
and saye: why shall we quyet oure
selues nowe, trustynge to reliefe,
where wee see nothynge, and were
nothynge at al releued when there
was great plentye of landes, and
goodes of Abbeys, Colegis, and
Chaunteries? Do not murmour
so vngodlye, but see that there be
no faulte in you, and ye shal fynd
no lacke in GOD. Suerlye, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
ye do sytte downe quietly, ye
shall soner prouoke goddes ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce
to your damnacion, then
deserue any reliefe of goddes offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
to your comfort. Sit downe
and be quyet, for the same rulers
&amp; ministers are ordeyned of god
to feede you wyth plentye: whych
be commaunded of God to make
you fyrste to set downe in order &amp;
quyetnes. Yea, and herke all ye
that be godlye Rulers: there was
much grasse in the place, god had
<pb facs="tcp:3917:29"/>
prouided muche grasse for theym
that loked for no carpets: geuyng
all godly gouernours example to
prouyde thynges necessarye for
those people that at loketh for no su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities.
But alas, here in
England, superfluous gorgeous
building is so much prouided for
ryche mens pleasures, that honest
houses do decay, where as labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
men ought to haue necessary
lodging. It is a commen custome
with couetous landlordes, to lette
their housynge so decaye, that the
fermer shalbe fayne for a smal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or none at all to gyue vppe
hys leasse, that they takynge the
groundes into their own handes,
may tourne al to pasture: so nowe
Old Fathers, poore Wydowes,
and yong children, lie begging in
the mirie stretes.</p>
            <p>O mercifull Lorde, what a
number of poore, feable, haulte
<pb facs="tcp:3917:30"/>
Blynde, Lame, sycklye, yea, wyth
idle vacaboundes, and dissembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge
kaityffes mixt among them,
lie and crepe, begging in the myry
streates of London and West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster?</p>
            <p>Nowe speakyng in the behalfe of
these vile beggers, for as much as
I know that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vilest person vpon
earth, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuely image of almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye
God, I wyll tell the that arte a
noble man, worshypfull man, an
honest welthye man, especiallye if
thou be Maire, Sherif, Alderma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
baily, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stable or any such officer,
it is to thy greate shame afore the
worlde, &amp; to thy vtter da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nacion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
god, to se these beggi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as thei
vse to do in the streates. For there
is neuer a one of these, but he lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
eyther thy charitable almes
to relieue his nede, or els thy due
correction to punyshe hys faute. A
great sin and no les shame is to for
<pb facs="tcp:3917:30"/>
him that sayeth he is a Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to se Chryst lack things necessary,
&amp; to bestowe vpon the deuil super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluousli.
It is Christ Iesus hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> self
that in the nedy doth suffer hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger,
thrist &amp; cold: It is the deuyll hym
selfe, that in the wealthye fareth
deintely, goeth gorgeously, &amp; vseth
superfluitie. Looke Mathewe the
xxv. &amp; there shal ye se playnly that
it is Christ which lacketh suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in the neady: and therefore the
deuyll beyng contrary to Chryst,
contrariwyse hathe to much in the
wealthye.</p>
            <p>You also that do prouyde that
your cattel do not longe tary pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in a folde where there is no
grasse, whye do you suffer youre
owne brethren in Chryst, wythout
prouysyon to lye in the streates,
where is muche myer? These selye
soules haue ben neglected thorow
oute all Englande, and especiallye
<pb facs="tcp:3917:31"/>
in Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Westminster: But
nowe I trust that a good ouerseer
a godly Byshop I meane, wyll se
that they in these two cities, shall
haue their nede reliued, and their
faultes corrected, to the good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample
of al other tounes &amp; cities.</p>
            <p>Take hede that ther be much
grasse to sit vpon, there as ye com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
the people to sit downe, that
there be sufficiente housynge and
other prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the people ther
as ye commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d theim to be quiet.
The men satte downe about fyue
thousandes in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. If they had
not bene obedient to sitte downe,
Christ wold not haue bene liberal
to haue gyuen them meate.</p>
            <p>Meate was prouided for the
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mens of England, and readye
to haue bene deliuered. But when
they were bydden to sit downe in
quietnes, they rose vp by rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and haue lost all the chere of that
<pb facs="tcp:3917:31"/>
feast. Yet that notwithstanding,
I trust that those which sat quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in dede, shal sone be fed with ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye,
if they sit styll vntyll it maye
conueniently be disposed. I praye
GOD they maye, I truste they
shal. The Euaungelist saith that
the men sat, namyng neyther wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
nor Chyldren, how be it there
was both women and Chyldren,
as appeareth in the other Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes.
And men be here named
onely, because al women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
did folow the example, and o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bey
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the fathers, and women of
their husbandes.</p>
            <p>Let not therefore your wyues
and chyldren, when they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode,
be so bold openly, as to say
or do any thinges of them selues,
but as they haue example and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of you. Now the
multitude placed in quyetnes,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3917:32"/>
Iesus toke the loues,
and when he hadde giuen
thankes, he deuided them
vnto his Disciples: and
the Disciples vnto them
that were set downe: and
lykewyse of the fyshes, so
much as they would</p>
            <p>Here learne fyrste of Chryste, to
take nothynge, be it neuer so lytell,
but wyth thankes rendered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vnto God: For of God sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
thou haste receiued it, by what
messenger or meane soeuer thou
came vnto it. Then secondarilye,
learne at the Apostles to geue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
other, that which the Lord hath
geuen vnto the, that thou mayest
truly say wyth the Apostel Paul.
<hi>Quod accepi a domino, hoc tradidi uobis.</hi>
That whiche I receyued of the
Lorde, haue I geuen vnto you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3917:32"/>
Beware that thou playe not the
wycked seruaunt, which kept his
talent hyd, and not delyuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any vse, for then it shal be taken
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the, and thou shalt be cast into
vtter darkenes.</p>
            <p>Nowe, to applye this miracle
vnto this present time, the kynges
Magesty may learne at Chryst to
take of his seruauntes, Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
Benefices, Improperacions
and all maner of Offyces, that be
not presently occupyed &amp; executed
of a faythful diligent officer, and
after thanckes geuen vnto God
therfore, to deliuer them vnto his
Counsell and Nobilyty to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
amongest the people of hys
Realme, whych be in such hunger
and lacke of faythful officers, and
house kepers, and godli preachers
that they must nedes faint, excepte
they be sone prouided for.</p>
            <p>And in thys dystrybucion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb facs="tcp:3917:33"/>
and benefyces, your Mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stye
wyth your Counsell had nede
to stand and beholde the dealyng
of your Nobles, as Christ dyd of
his Apostles. For it is not vnlike
but as there was amongest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
Apostles, so wyll there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
euery Chrysten Kynges
Counsellers and Nobles, some
Iudas whych is to be trusted no
further then he can be seene. For
in syghte Iudas doth as other of
hys felowes do: but beyng out of
syghte he solde hys Maister. And
so the most couetous of them all,
wyll be afrayde to do any thynge
amysse, yf you loke vpon: but if
your backes be turned, then wyll
couetous Iudas sell dearly that
whych hys liberal maister gyueth
frelye. As for example of late da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes,
the Kynges Magestye that
deade is, dyd gyue a Benefyce to
be appropryat vnto the Uniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitye
<pb facs="tcp:3917:33"/>
of Cambrydge. <hi>In liberam et pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
eliemosinam:</hi> As fre and pure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
Howe be it, hys handes were
so vnpure, whiche should haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered
it, that he receiued .vi. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
poundes of the Unyuersytye
for it. Whether that this .vi.C.
pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds were conueied to the kings

whyche by playne wrytynge was
geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> frely, or els put into some Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>das
pouch, I would it were kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen.
For nowe, by suche charitable
Almes, the king is slaundered, the
parish vndone, and the vniuersyty
in worse case then it was afore.</p>
            <p>Pleaseth it your Magestye, wyth
your honourable Counsell, for the
reuerence of God, the pytye of the
poore, and the godlye zele that ye
haue to good learning, heare what
hath bene done in your tyme.</p>
            <p>Your Magesty hath had gyuen
&amp; receiued by Act of Parliament,
<pb facs="tcp:3917:34"/>
Colleges, Chauntries, &amp; guyldes
for mani good consideracions, and
especially as appeareth in the same
Act, for exectinge of grammer scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
to the educacion of youthe in
vertue &amp; godlynes, to the further
augmentynge of the vniuersities,
and better prouision for the poore
and nedy. But now, many Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
scholes, and muche charytable
prouision for the poore, be taken,
sold, and made awaye, to the greate
flaunder of you and youre lawes,
to the vtter discomfort of the pore,
to the greuous offence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to the mooste miserable drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
of youthe in ygnoraunce,
and soore decaye of the Uniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>There was in the North coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye,
amongest the rude people in
knowledge (whyche be most readye
to spend theyr liues and goodes, in
seruinge the king at the burnyng
<pb facs="tcp:3917:34"/>
of a Beacon) there was a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
schole founded, hauynge in the
Uniuersitie of Cambrydge, of the
same foundacion .viii. scholerships
two felowshippes, euer replenished
wyth the scholers of that schole,
whych schole is now sold, decayed,
and loste. Mo there be of lyke sort
handled: But I recyte thys one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
because I knowe that the sale
of it was once stayed of charytye,
and yet afterwardes broughte to
passe by brybrye, as I hearde saye,
and beleue it, because that it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brybrye that customablye ouer
commeth charytye.</p>
            <p>For gods sake you that be in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorytye,
loke vpon it.</p>
            <p>For if ye winke at suche matters,
God wyl scouse vpon you. Thinke
not that I do burden you w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more
than that which God by hys ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out your willes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentes,
hath charged you wythal.
<pb facs="tcp:3917:35"/>
For by whose faute or negligence
so euer it was, that thynges afore
tyme haue ben vncharytably abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
suerlye it is your charge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
be nowe in authorytye, to se at
thys tyme all such thynges as yet
remayne out of order, rightuously,
spedely, and charitably redressed.</p>
            <p>And as I do perceyue, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
of these thynges afore tyme,
hath offended God, troubled the
common wealth, and brought some
men towardes shame &amp; confusion:
So do I wyshe, praye, and trust,
that nowe the redresse of the same
maye be to gods pleasure, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, &amp; to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honor &amp; establish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
of them that be in most highe
authorytye.</p>
            <p>Heare therefore, and I wyl tel
you more: There were in some
townes .vi. some .viii. and some a
dosyn kyne, gyuen vnto a stocke
for the relyefe of the poore, and vsed
<pb facs="tcp:3917:35"/>
in such wyse, that the poore cotin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
which could make any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
for fodder, had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, milke for a
very small hyre, &amp; then the number
of the stocke reserued, al manner of
vayles besydes, bothe the hyre of
the mylke, and the pryces of the
yong veales, and olde fatte wares,
was disposed to the reliefe of the
poore, these be also soulde, taken,
and made awaye. The Kynge bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the slaunder, the poore feleth
the lacke, but who hath the profit
of suche thynges, I canne not tell:
but well I wot, and al the worlde
seeth, that the Acte of Parlimente
made by the Kynges Magestye,
and hys Lordes and Commens of
the Parliamente, for the maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
of learnynge, and reliefe of
the poore, hathe serued some, as a
most fit instrument to rob learning
and to spoyl the pore.</p>
            <p>If you that now be in authorytye
<pb facs="tcp:3917:36"/>
do not loke vpon such thynges to
redresse them, god wyl loke vpon
you, to reuenge theym. Here haue
I rehersed theim, that the Kynges
Magestye, wyth you of hys coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
maye learne not onelye by the
doctrine &amp; examples of scripture,
but also by experience in hys own
land, to se and consider howe hys
benefytes, put into the handes of
hys nobles and offycers, be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and vsed amongest his inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
people.</p>
            <p>For if landed men &amp; offycers by
keping of houses, &amp; doing of theyr
dutyes in theyr countryes, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
amonge the people, all that
they haue receiued of god, by the
kynges gyft, theyr fathers inhery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
or other waies: then shal god
giue such encrese, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery man shall
haue inough.</p>
            <p>As Salomon, the .xi. of the
Prouerbes testifieth: <hi>Alii diuidunt
<pb facs="tcp:3917:36"/>
propria, et ditiores fiunt: alii rapiunt non
sua, et semper in egestate sunt:</hi> Some
dispose and gyue theyr owne, and
become rycher and rycher: some
doo rauine and spoyle that whiche
is not theyr owne, and be euer in
lacke and deede. As ye see in day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
experience, those that do theyr
owne duties in executinge theyre
offyces, and bestowe theyr owne
goodes in kepynge good houses,
baue euer suche plentye, that all
other men maruayle from whence
god sendeth it. And those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do no du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties,
nor kepe no houses, but brybe
in theyr offyces, and polle theyr te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes,
take so much and haue so li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tel,
that all men wonder how the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyl
they waste it.</p>
            <p>Nothynge is more true then the
Gospell: <hi>Date, et dabitur uobis:</hi> Gyue
&amp; it shal be gyuen vnto you. Gyue
plentifully vnto other, and godwil
gyue more plentie vnto you.
<pb facs="tcp:3917:37"/>
For God wyll alwayes be afore
hand, in giuyng good giftes. For
as appeareth in thys gospell, when
the Apostles hadde giuen vnto the
people so muche good meate as
they desyred, then saieth the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliste.</p>
            <p>When they wer filled,
Iesus sayeth to hys dysci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
Gather vp the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
meates that remaine,
so that nothynge be lost.
They therefore gathered
and fylled .xii. baskets ful
wyth the broken meates
remaining of that which
they had eaten.</p>
            <p>Here they gaue but .v. loues &amp; two
fishes, &amp; ther was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .xii
baskets ful of meates.</p>
            <p>The Wyddowe of Sarepthat
<pb facs="tcp:3917:37"/>
gaue but one handfull of flowre,
and a litle oile vnto Elias, and had
gyuen vnto her againe so much as
serued her and her sonne, al the time
of the great drought .iii. Reg .xvii.
Learne therfore that couetous bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bry
&amp; extorcion hath neuer inough:
and charytable lyberalytye euer
hath plentye.</p>
            <p>Here also maye rych men learne,
when and howe to fyll theyr store
houses. Surely, euen as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
dyd fyll theyr baskettes, when
the people haue inoughe, then by
gatherynge vp that whiche elles
shoulde be lost. So dyd Iosephe
in Egipt, suffer no corne to be lost
in the yeares of plentye, but stored
it vp in barnes, to reléue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
wyth, in the tyme of darth: Not
as couetous Carles do here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
forstall the markets, and by
corne at al tymes, to begyn and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
a dearthe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3917:38"/>
Blessed be they that sell, to make
good cheape, and cursed be they
that bye, to make it deare. For Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
sayeth. Prouerbes .xi.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qui abscondit frumenta, maledicetur in
populis: benediccio autem super caput uen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencium:</hi>
He that hydeth vp corne,
shall be cursed amongest the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
But blessynge be vpon theyr
heades, that sell.</p>
            <p>Nowe, to teache Chrysten ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
theyr dutyes, in the example
of Chrystes Apostles: marke howe
the Apostles dyd fyrst minister vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the people, and than gathered
vp for them selues, teaching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all Chrysten ministers, lande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lordes,
offycers, and rulers, fyrste
to minister vnto the people, euerye
one the dutye of hys owne voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
afore they gather of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
rentes, tythes, or fees, by the
name and aucthorytye of that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion.
<hi>Qui non labor at,</hi> sayeth Paule,
<pb facs="tcp:3917:38"/>
               <hi>non manducet:</hi> He that doeth not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
should not eate. He that doth
no worke, shoulde take no wages:
he that doeth no dutyes, shoulde
take no fees. Alas, thys is goddes
woorde, wrytten in hys wyll and
Testamente, sealed wyth Chrystes
bloude, and yet the customes and
lawes of Englande be cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye.
For it hathe bene custome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably

these for the most part be paied.</p>
            <p>For he that hath the propertyes

I say, which not only by sayinges
but also in wrytynges, do name &amp;
call theiues, murtherers, &amp; wolfes
that be euyll, by the names of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
<pb facs="tcp:3917:39"/>
pastors, and lambes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
be good. I do not onlye meane
Persons, Prebendaryes, and other
benefised men, but also all manner
officers, whiche haue wages, fees,
or liuinges, because you geue them
such names, and not for that they
do such dutyes.</p>
            <p>These be al Wolfs, and the names
and titles that you gyue them, be
nothynge els but shepe skynnes.</p>
            <p>Some saye, they wyll take better
heede hereafter, but that whiche is
nowe past, can not nowe be called
backe, and amended. Yea, and it
were great pytye, seynge that they
haue payed the fyrst fruites vnto
the Kinges Magesty, and no smal
reward vnto other men, perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
bought theyr offyces dearelye, now
to put them out of those lyuynges,
wyth the losse. of. all those charges
whiche they haue bestowed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
as other wayes, to gette
<pb facs="tcp:3917:40"/>
such lyuynges.</p>
            <p>Wo, wo wo vnto you hypocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
that stumble at a strawe, and
leape ouer a blocke, that strayne
out a gnat, and swalowe vp a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell,
that pytye more the losse of
mens brybrye, whiche was geuen
to corrupt some men, then the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnder fote of Christes bloud,
whiche was shead, to saue all men,
that dooe imagin it pytye to dryue
the theues, murtherers and wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongest y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lambs of God,
redemed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christs precious blud,
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto your gouernaunce
and kepynge.</p>
            <p>As God shal helpe me, I speake
wyth feare, pytye, and reuerence:
if you do not rather pulle the she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
skinnes ouer the wolfes eares,
and hang theyr carcases vpon the
pales, then suffer theym to conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe
styll, God wyll plucke you
downe wyth some sodein mischiefe,
<pb facs="tcp:3917:40"/>
rather then mainteine or suffer you
in so hygh authorytye, to vse such
vncharitable, vngodly, and cruell
pytye. You knowe that some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
haue bought theyr benefyces, haue
bought theyr offyces, than must ye
nedes know, that eyther Christ is
a lyer, or els that they be entered in
as theues, to spoyle, murther, and
to destroye.</p>
            <p>If you suffer theues, murtherers
and wolfes to take theyr plesures
amongest Goddes lambes, I tell
you playne, God wyll not longe
suffer you to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hedshepherds, &amp;
gouernours, &amp; feders of hys la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bes.</p>
            <p>And take hede you people that
on the otherside ye runne not into
an vntollerable stobernes, deniyng
your re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, your tithes, or other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture forbydoeth you
vtterly, to deny or withdrawe any
thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: thou art co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded if
he conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to take thy cloke to geue
<pb facs="tcp:3917:41"/>
hym also thy cote. What soeuer is
asked, rather gyue more, than by
denyinge of that, not to shewe thy
selfe to be an innocent shepe that
gyueth hys fleese, but a noysome
Goat, that striketh with the horne.
You are alwayes bounden to geue
the flese. It is the magistrates du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to consider and note, whether
they be theues or shepherds, dogs
or woulfes, that taketh the fleese.
Medle not wyth other mennes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for if ye do, surely ye shal finde
no remedye, but prouoke vncolou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
vengeaunce.</p>
            <p>Nowe to tourne to oure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
purpose, lette all theym that
do receiue offices, landes, power,
or authorytye frome God, by the
kynges gyfte, or by other meanes,
Firste bestowe &amp; dispose the dutyes
of those thynges faithfullye amon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gest
the people, afore they gather
vp to theim selues the reuenues &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:3917:41"/>
commodities of the same from the
people. And then when as no man
can come to meat, but by doyng of
labour, nor none to receyuynge of
fees, but by doing of duties, surely
euery man shal haue as much as
he deserueth, &amp; no man shall lacke
that which he needeth.</p>
            <p>For he, that by doing of greate
duties deserueth the moste, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teininge
the fees and rewardes due
for the same dutyes, shall haue the
best. And he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in nede, hauinge
no trust to get any thyng by idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
crafte, or flattery, shalbe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to vse that labour &amp; honest
exercise, whyche shall relyeue hys
nede sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. Yea, by thys mean
no man shall spende hys tyme in
idlenesse, nor vse any labour or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
wythout due recompence,
For nede shall dryue all men from
slouthfull idlenesse, vnto labour &amp;
dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: and where as no laboure
<pb facs="tcp:3917:42"/>
nor dylygence lacketh hys iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
there euery labouring and
diligent man, shal haue sufficient
plenty: So ye see how thys doeth
consequently ensue, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>shal
haue sufficient inough &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye,
wheras men do first dispose,
minister, &amp; giue according to theyr
dutyes, &amp; afterwards receiue kepe
&amp; saue that which God doth sende
as a rewarde, encreased &amp; augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for doing of theyr dutyes.</p>
            <p>So dyd the Apostles, after the
faythful diligent disposyng of the
v. loues and .ii. fyshes receiue and
keepe theyr rewarde wonderfullye
augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, to replenish and fyl .xii.
baskets. So God graunt, that all
officers in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d may wyth such
faithful diligence do theyr duties
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may please God to gyue to all
the people sufficient inough, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
euery minister, the basket of his
honest desire, heaped vp bi the brim</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3917:42"/>
The men therfore seynge what
a signe Iesus had done, sayd that
this is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Prophet, whiche cometh
into the worlde. This is euen he
whom Moises, the law, &amp; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
do teache, to be the fully &amp;
only sufficient sauiour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world.
Moses saying, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .xviii. of Deut.
A Prophet of thy nacion &amp; of thy
brethren, lyke vnto me, shall the
Lorde thy God rayse vp vnto the,
hym shalt thou heare. The lawe,
as a tutour, leadeth &amp; bryngeth al
men to thys sauyour, to receyue of
hym that perfeccion, which the law
it selfe lacketh. The Prophetes
dyd tel long afore of this sauiour
which is now comen in our tyme,
after theyr dayes. Thys was the
peoples confession of Chryst, after
that they were by so great a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
so plentyfullye fed. Christe ofte
afore had wrought wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
disputed learnedly, &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb facs="tcp:3917:43"/>
playnely: but by al those mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
did he not so muche perswade
the people, and win theyr heartes,
as by thys one miracle, in feeding
&amp; cheryshinge the people. Yea, and
whosoeuer listeth to mark thorowe
out all Englande, he shall se that
a meane learned person, keping an
house in hys paryshe, and beyng of
godly conuersacion, shal perswade
&amp; teach mo of hys parishners with
communicacion at one meale, than
the best learned doctor of diuinitie
kepynge no house can perswade or
teache in hys parish by preachyng
a dosen solemne sermons.</p>
            <p>Lyke wyse the gentle man that
kepeth a good house in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey
shalbe in better credit with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for hys liberalitye, then the best
orator or lawier in England, for
all hys eloquence. I do not prayse
those men whych brybe and pol al
the yeare to kepe riot in theyr hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb facs="tcp:3917:43"/>
for a fortnyght, a moneth, or a
quarter of a yeare: But those I se
beloued, trusted &amp; obeyed, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge
to theyr habilitie, keepe
good houses continually.</p>
            <p>And the chiefe cause why the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
doo not loue, trust, nor obey
the gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; officers, is, because
the gentlemen and officers buylde
many fayre houses, and kepe fewe
good houses, haue plentye of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to tell fayre tales, but vse
lytell faythfull dylygence in doing
of theyr duties. Wherefore, sende
forth, and place in euerye countrye
godly preachers, wel disposed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and faithful diligent officers
of all sortes. Yea, but where shuld
we now fynd liuyngs for al those?</p>
            <p>Forsoth I do tel you: Outand
away with the wily foxes, the false
flatteryng theues, &amp; the rauenyng
wolfes, and than se how many lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
how many offices, prebendes,
<pb facs="tcp:3917:44"/>
and benefices ye finde voyde, howe
mani you haue amongest your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
that youre boye caryeth, that
your chapleynes, your seruaunts,
and your houshold officers haue, &amp;
let all these be broughte forth: and
althoughe at the fyrste syghte they
shal seme to litle, and fewe to serue
so greate a Realme with so manye
shyres, beyng all runne nowe oute
of ciuil order into rude wildernes,
Yet, after equal diuidyng &amp; fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
diligent ministring of those lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
and fyshes, of these prebends,
personages, and all kynd of offices
amongest the people, God of hys
goodnesse shall geue suche increase
vnto the people, hauynge thereby
sufficiente plenty of Chrystes holy
worde of good ciuil order, &amp; of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
reliefe, that there shal be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynyng
so much tithes, offrynge,

thys one acte perswade and allure

then all that euer was done afore:
For when they shall see, that by
