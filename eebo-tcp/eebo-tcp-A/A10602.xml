            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd therfore sholde noo man care nor be heuy that he is so troubled more than an other. Sy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ster alwaye whan I speke of a man in this wrytynge take it bothe for man and woman / for so it is ment in all suche wrytynges / for all is mankynde / and ferther more as touchynge your troubles thynke in all your dyseases what troubles goddes seruauntes hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred and what paynes and turmentes they haue had here in this worlde in many sondry maners and ye shall fynde cause to suffre. Leo the pope sayth / it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth somtyme that good and ryght wyse soules be sty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red sharpely by the fende / &amp; somtyme by theyr owne compleccyon to angers troubles dredes &amp; suche other taryenges that it semeth to them theyr lyf a turment in so moche that somtyme for very drede the begyn to dyspayre bothe in lyfe of body and soule / thynkynge
<pb facs="tcp:90:6"/>
they be forsaken of god / whiche dooth it but to assaye and proue his chosen chyldren and frendes by suche temptacyons. For as I afore haue sayd at the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of this wrytyng in lyke maner as fyre purgeth golde and as a knyghte is proued good and hardy by batayle: ryght so temptacyons and troubles purgeth a ryght wyse soule / this is proued well by Toby / for the aungell Raphaell sayd this to hym. Toby for as moche as thou arte ryghtfull to god it is nedefull that temptacyon sholde preue thy wyll / and well it is kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen that sykenes falleth to a man after the dysposy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon of his compleccyon. So lyke wyse temptacyon as Leo the pope sayth. The fende our ghostly enemy aspyeth in euery man what wyse he is dysposed by his compleccyon / and by that disposicyon he tempteth hym. For there as he fyndeth a man full of malencoly he tempteth hym moost with ghoostly temptacyons of Ire. But they that wyll attende to withstande it for the loue of god they must shape them to pacyence &amp; saye with Iob. Sythen we haue receyued of god so grete benefaytes why sholde we not receyue and suffre dyseases. And thynke on the grete anguysshes sorowes and dyseases that our lorde Ihesu cryste suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred hymselfe here in erth. And also suffred his blyssed moder to haue the same. And thynke that to suffre dys<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ease pacyently is the waye to heuen warde. And that ye may not in this frayle worlde be so free as an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell that is confermed by grace / but whyle your body and soule be togyder in this lyf they must receyue trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bles as well as eases. And thynke not that god hath forsaken you: but mekely abyde the comforte of hym
<pb facs="tcp:90:6"/>
and without doubte whan it nedeth ye shal not fayle therof. But some men whan they haue drede of salua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon or be tempted to dyspayre by vysyons or ghostly sterynges of theyr owne frayltye / they wene anone that they haue synned in the synne of the holy ghoost / and than the fende putteth in them that they may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be saued nor forgyuen of theyr trespaces. Thus speketh the fende w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in them. So ferynge synne good creatures that they wene to goo out of theyr myndes / But they that ben thus tempted answere the fende thus agayne that he is false and a lyer as his nature is to be. For the synne of the holy ghoost as clerkes sayth is infynyte without repentaunce. And that is whan a man wylfully by delyberacyon wyll neuer repente nor aske god mercy ne forgyuenes of his synnes / nor wyll be tourned / but wylfully departeth hym from the goodnes of god / and in his wretchednes abydeth wylfully with full consent of wyll / he that doth thus synneth in the holy ghoost whiche may not be forgy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen here nor elles where / for he wyll not trust in the goodnes of the holy ghoost nor aske forgyuenes of his synnes. And therfore he that wyll noo mercy aske noo mercy shall haue / for his synnes be infynyte without repentaunce. But thoughe a man or a woman haue or fele all these vycyous sterynges and as many moo as ony herte can thynke ayenst theyr owne free wyll and whan reason cometh to them they be sory therof &amp; flee alwaye hastely to the mercy of god: it is to them but a preuynge or a clensynge of theyr synnes though they be neuer soo ofte in the nyght and the daye now vp now downe as wrestelers be / &amp; thoughe ye haue
<pb facs="tcp:90:7"/>
ony tyme fall in ony synne ghoostly or flesshely &amp; layne therin wylfully by delyberacyon and full content of herte: ye than ought to be sory and aske god forgyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with as grete contrycyon as god wyll gyue you grace / and than thynke fully the goodnes of the holy ghoost surmounteth all synnes that euer was done or euer shall be done / though a man had synned in them all / as well in dede as thought he beynge truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryte &amp; confessed mekynge hymselfe lowly to almygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty god and to his sacramentes of holy chyrche / doubte ye not he so askynge mercy shall haue full forgyuenes of all his synnes / for the mercy of god is so grete that it passeth all his werkes. And therfore thoughe ye somtyme here by spekynge or elles of wrytynge or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge in bokes sharpe wordes and harde sentences: yet comforte your selfe and thynke well that all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che harde wordes be sayd and wryten to chastyse the synners and to withdrawe them from euyll / and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to pourge and pure goddes specyall louers as the metall is in the fyre afore rehersed / and in them god wyll make his hous. And wete it well many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that seme full harde be ment full tenderly whan they be well vnderstonde / and though some wordes be ment ryght hardely as the playne texte sheweth / yet sholde ye not take them to you warde / but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte your selfe and thynke that all those harde senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces shall be fulfylled in Iewes and sarasyns / for the crysten people that wyll be contryte &amp; trust in goddes mercy or haue a wyl so for to do: they shal escape all pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rylles / so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shall not perysshe / but be saued / where as the Iewes &amp; sarasyns in theyr perylles shal vtterly

perysshe to pardycyon / for they haue not the strength of Baptym ne the precyous oyntement of crystes pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syon / that sholde gyue to theyr soules lyf and helth. Of this they haue example &amp; a grete fygure in holy wryte that where as Moyses ledde the chyldren of Israell ouer the reed see whiche were goddes people. Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses wente before them and smote the water with his rodde and therwith the water parted &amp; the chyldren of Israell wente ouer in suertye. And they of egypte that folowed perysshed &amp; were drowned. By Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses I vnderstonde our lorde Ihesu cryste / and by the yerde or rodde that departed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water I vnderstonde his holy passyon / and by the chyldren of Israell that were not perysshed all crysten people / for ryght so our lorde Ihesu cryst came from his faders bosome to the see of trybulacyons &amp; temptacyons to be our guyde &amp; leder / he gooth before vs with his precyous passyon &amp; smyteth awaye the perylles of our troublous tempta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyons / so that we shall not perysshe / but it shall brynge vs to suertye of euerlastynge lyf / and therfore gyue we to hym thankynges louynges &amp; infynyte praysynges as the chyldren of Israell dyde / for thoughe a crysten man were neuer soo synfull thynkynge hymselfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he stode in the sentences of the hardest wordes that be wryten: yet sholde he trust faythfully in the mercy of god / for and he wyll forsake his synnes &amp; tourne hym to good and vertuous lyf: he shall haue grace and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuenes / and the harde sharpe wordes of dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon sholde tourne hym to mercy and saluacyon. For thus sayth our lord god in holy wryte by his prophete Ieremye / though I make grete thretes I shall repent
<pb facs="tcp:90:8"/>
me of my wordes yf my people wyll repent them of theyr synnes. O beholde the grete goodnes of our lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de / and how pyte alwaye constrayneth hym to mercy worshyp and thankes be euer to his goodnes / he is so benygne and mercyfull to them that be repentaunt that he frely wyll chaunge his sentences from sharpe vengeaunce to forgyuenes / &amp; of the paynes that they be worthy to suffre / gyue them alygeaunce or lyghter payne to suffre. He sayth also by the prophete I saye I shall forgyue the synnes of euery man that with ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry true contrycyon wyll drawe hym to good and ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuous lyfe. And this grete mercy shewed our lorde openly vpon the Cyte of Niniue / and also by kynge Ezechie / therfore lette noo man dyspayre but alwaye trust fully to goddes mercy that so well can redresse our myscheues and tourne all our woo to wele / and our sorowe to Ioye. O thou gloryous myghtyfull god that thus meruayllously werketh in thy creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res it is to se that thy mercy is large and brode whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che maketh the to chaunge thy sentence that before was bothe thy wyll and worde / blessyd be thou good lorde in all thy vertues for thou canst / may / and wyll tourne and chaunge all our infyrmytees to our moost proufyte yf we wyll not flee from the / but tourne to thy goodnes and aske mercy. But for all this thy gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te goodnes / god forbede that ony man sholde be the more bolder to synne or wylfully and wyttyngly by delyberacyon sholde presume to falle to synne vpon trust of thy mercy. And therfore our lorde is so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyfull I surely trust that euery true courteys soule wyl be the more lothe to offende his goodnes / and as for
<pb facs="tcp:90:8"/>
you that be tempted ayenst your wyll / and wyll not for all the worlde dysplease god wylfully: but that ye be thus begyled and encombred by the fende with many paynefull thoughtes / be ye not afrayde of the fende nor of his ferefull assawtes / for he is full sore dyscomforted whan that he seeth a man or a woman whiche he soo tempteth is not aferde of hym. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme the fende cometh and tempteth a soule fyersly lyke a dragon / and somtyme he assaylleth hym lyke a rampynge lyon / but and yf a creature strengthynge hymselfe saddely in the passyon of almyghty god / and arme hym with that holy passyon / a thousande suche fendes how someuer that they come shall haue noo more power ouer hym thenne hath as many flyes or gnattes. And therfore strength you all in god and be not abasshed. Soo to strength and arme you in hym though ye be synfull / for he sayth hymselfe in the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell he came for synners. And in an other place of the gospell he saythe that he came for mercy and not for noo vengeaunce / and to be our shelde and strength and so lette vs humbly with a meke herte take hym And yf ye fele ony dredes by ymagynacyon or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacyon or for wordes that ye haue herde or redde in bookes by the whiche ye doubte of saluacyon / than thynke on the wordes that cryste hymselfe taught to a man that doubted / sayenge and askynge of our lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de who sholde be saued / for he thoughte it was to harde to hymselfe for to esche we all the poyntes that ledde man to pardycyon. And our lorde badde hym for to saye Credo in deum patrem omnipotentem creatorem celi et terre. Et in iesum christu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> filium cius.
<pb facs="tcp:90:9"/>
Byleue sayd our lorde Ihesu that god the fader is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghty and that no thynge to hym is impossyble but that he may forgyue all synnes and redresse all wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and brynge the soules to his blysse and thynke fer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thermore that his myght and power may do all that his wysdome can / and his goodnes wyl / and therfore truste fully that by his goodnes he wyll saue you and brynge you to euerlastynge Ioye whan he seeth best tyme / for he hath bought you full dere with his precy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blode and paynefull deth. And I dare sauely saye that there is none so synfull a caytyf whiche is cryste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or wolde be crystened this daye on the erthe all thoughe he were in the syght of god dampnable and in the syght of all creatures also: ye and yet were Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be dampned by all scrypture and he wolde for sake his synne and be contryte and aske god forgyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he sholde haue mercy and forgyuenes of hym / &amp; yf it were so that he stode in that case or had a good mynde to stonde so in the tyme of deth he sholde be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued / the myght &amp; mercy of god is so grete that it sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth all his lawes Iugementes and scryptures And so our lorde Ihesus sheweth vs by an example in the gospell of a woman that was founde in aduou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and by Moyses lawe whiche was ordeyned by god y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she sholde be stoned to the deth. But the myght and the wysdome of that blessyd lorde god was soo gretely shewed to the pharyzens whiche accused her that they so largely perceyued theyr synnes that they myght not for shame deme her but stale awaye out of the temple. And our lorde Ihesu wolde not deme her but of his gracyous mercy forgaue her all her synnes
<pb facs="tcp:90:9"/>
And therfore be a man or woman neuer soo synfull and that they fele neuer soo many bodely and ghostly synnes alwaye rysynge and sterynge within them / they sholde neuer the rather dyspayre of the mercy of god / ne be dyscomforted. For there as moche synne is / there is shewed moche mercy and grace / and the good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of god is knowen by the forgyuenes of the synne whan a body turneth hym there from and is very con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tryte / but god forbede as I sayd before that ony crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be the more recheles or bolde to synne wylfully / for in so moche the mercy of god is so large we ought to be the more besy and dylygent to loue and prayse hym. Almyghty god werketh lyke a leche / for a leche suffreth somtyme the deed flesshe to growe on hym that he hath in cure / but afterwarde he taketh away the same and maketh the quycke flesshe to growe / and soo he heleth the pacyent. Ryght soo dooth our lorde Ihesu cryste maker of heuen and erth suffreth somtyme a man or a woman to fall in deedly synne: but afterwarde of his grete mercy and pyte he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to his hande of grace / for they that were deedly wounded thorough synne he heleth them and was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth away theyr synnes with the water of his well of mercy / &amp; maketh in them quycke vertues to growe wherby he gyueth to theym euerlastynge lyfe. Our lorde god is also lyke a gardyner for a gardyner suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth somtyme wycked wedes to growe in his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyn / and whan the erth thorugh moysture of rayne wexeth tender he taketh &amp; pulleth awaye the wedes bothe rote &amp; rynde. So in lyke wyse dooth our lorde Ihesu cryst he suffreth somtyme in his gardyn whiche
<pb facs="tcp:90:10"/>
is mannes soule wycked dedes of synne to growe / but whan the herte of man wexeth tender by meke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and moysture of contrycyon he than taketh away all the synnes bothe rote and rynde and planteth and setteth in his gardyn herbes and fruytes of good ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues / and watreth them with the dewe of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syd goodnes / wherby the soule of man shall come to euerlastynge Ioye and reste. Now than sythen our lorde god is so good so pyteous and soo mercyfull to synners that wylfully offendeth hym by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myttynge of horryble synnes / moche more he is mercyfull and hath pyte and compassyon of a soule / that thorughe trouble and temptacyons falleth to synne / for almygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty god suffreth often tymes the soule of man for to be tempted and vexed in withstandynge temptacyons / wherof it deserueth the more meryte. And therfore be ye not doubtefull nor heuy for it shall neuertourne you to peryll ne daunger but to grete proufyte. For therby ye shall wynne the crowne of glorye and the palme of vyctorye whiche shall be gyuen to you for withstandynge of suche temptacyons / &amp; to the fende it shall tourne to shame and confusyon / and though it semeth to you somtyme that ye fele dyscorde bytwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne god and you be not therfore recreaunt ne dyscom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. For almyghty god sayth by his prophete I saye A lytell whyle I haue forsaken and hydde my face from the: but I shall call the to me agayne by my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde mercyes whiche euer shall endure.</p>

Ryght so yf a man be in perfyte rest and quyetnes of herte / it is no maystry for hym to serue god.

One is that though a creature be it man or woman be neuer so well ne soo ofte shryuen / yet the fende maketh them byleue they are not well shryuen / and that he dooth to brynge the soule in heuynes / and so anoyeth &amp; troubleth the poore soule that he maketh hym to forgete what he wolde saye / &amp; therby maketh hym out of rest tyll he be newly shryuen agayne.

The seconde why<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le and colour that the fende maketh to withdrawe goodnes is that whan a man or a woman by deuout sterynges of thoughtes haue felynges of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon and medytacyon as perauenture some solytarye persones hath: and he maketh them to thynke that to holde &amp; kepe that medytacyons is to theyr moost prou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyte to thentent they sholde leue theyr dyuyne seruyce that they be bounde to / and bryngeth them in suche a combraunce that they wote not whyche waye is

best to them to take / and all this he dooth vtterly to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue them and cause them to be vnquyet to doo ony of theym bothe. The thyrde crafte or wyle that he tempteth with is whan a man or a woman gyueth them to honest dysporte to strength them selfe ayenst his false wyles to the comforte of theyr owne soule / than wyll the fende cause theym to haue a conscyence therof / and putteth in to theyr myndes that all suche dysportes is but synne and vanyte.

And as to the seconde temptacyon wherby the fende wolde lette a man from his dyuyne seruyce that he is bounde vnto vtterly temptynge hym to leue it: than ought he to be the more dylygent deuoutly &amp; reuerently with good aduysement to saye it / &amp; yf it be so he say alone his seruyce he may whan good though<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes come or that it wyll please god with swetenes or some hye vysytacyon of the holy ghoost to vysyte and touche hym / than shall it be but well done for to stynte of his seruyce / &amp; attende to that medytacyon for a tyme and after to saye forth / soo that his seruyce that he is bounde vnto be not lefte vnsayd or vndone / and in thus doynge it shall be but lytell lettynge to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce / and he shall fynde grete comforte and ease therin For though it lette hym for the tyme: it shall well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hym to the quyckenes of his soule an other tyme.

Gloryous trinite sende me clennes of herte / purete of soule / re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store me with thy holy vertues / strength me with thy myght / that I alway may withstande the fende and all euyll temptacyons.

hym to preche at Rome in the audyence of the grete prelates of the worlde and shewed by fygures and examples this blessyd vyrgyn to be saluted moost spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyally by her psalter. All they meruaylled of thafflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his wordes. They were astonyed at the grete wonders. To whome he sayd. O faythfull and true lordes and other true louers of the fayth: here this syn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guler holsome sayenge to you all / that ye may veryly knowe those thynges whiche I haue spoken to be true. Take the psalter of this blessyd vyrgyne / and in sayenge it: call deuoutely vnto your remembraunce the passyon of cryste. Thus I shewe vnto you that ye shall haue in experyence the spyryte of god bothe in sayenge and in forgyuynge. Truely soo greate a flambe may not stonde in ony place without makyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge hote. Neyther soo grete lyghte without gyuynge lyght / nor soo godly a medycyne without the vertue of makynge hole. What sholde I saye more / all the people gaue audyence and in maner astonyed: they meruaylled of his godly wordes / many persones not onely of the comyn people / but also of grete prelates of the chyrche as reuerende cardynalles and many ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nourable bysshoppes toke vpon them to saye this psal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of our lady / to thentent they myght gete some gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of almyghty god. A meruayllous thynge. The cyte beynge in trouble / dyuerse multyplycacyon of prayers was amonges the people in euery state or degre. For truly thou myght se bothe mornynge / euenynge / and at myddaye men and women euery where berynge the psalter of our lady. Cardynalles whiche be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

the pyllers of the worlde and bysshoppes sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to bere in theyr handes &amp; at theyr gyrdelles these soo grete tokens of the godhede and of our fayth veryly to be byleued. Truely by the myracles of our lady shewed by saynt Domynyck they doubted not but in excercysynge of this psalter goddes helpe to be redy at all tymes. What more. All that dyde assaye this psalter perceyued some knowlege of the pyte of god. And amonges all I shall shewe this wonder or myracle onely folowynge. At Rome was a certayne mysdysposed woman of her body moost famouse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other lyke dysposed / in beaute / eloquence / ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parayle / and worldly gladnes / whiche fortuned gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyously to haue the psalter of our lady by thaduyse of holy saynt Domynyk / whiche she hydde vnder her kyrtell and sayd it many tymes on the daye. But alas she neuertheles vsed the vnlawfull flesshely pleasure and vnclennes of her body aboue all other / more men resorted to her than to ony other woman of suche vay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne dysposycyon. This woman named fayre Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryne for the incomperable beaute of her body conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in her mysselyuynge / and ones on the day at the leest she dyde vysyte the chyrche sayenge the psalter of our lady / and thus was her medytacyon and thought The fyrst fyfty she sayd for the infancye of cryst in the whiche he bare all his passyon to come / and yf it were not at that tyme in execucyon / neuertheles it was in his entent and mynde. The seconde fyfty she sayd for crystes passyon exhybyte and done royally lyke as he suffred in his manhode. The thyrde fyfty she sayd for
<pb facs="tcp:90:22"/>
the passyon of cryste as it was in his godhede / not by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the godhede as the godhede myght suffre / but bycause this infynyte godhede loued so moche the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man / that yf it had ben mortall it sholde haue suffred deth. Therfore bycause the eternall wysdome of god in hymselfe myght not dye for vs / he toke vpon hym our manhode / whiche his wyll was sholde suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre passyon &amp; dye for all mankynde. And as this fayre Katheryne thus contynued in prayenge / it happened on a season as she wente aboute Rome wandrynge after her olde maner / a meruayllous fayre man mette her &amp; sayd. Heyle Katheryne / why stondest thou here / hast thou noo dwellynge place. To whome she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered sayenge. Syr I haue a dwellynge place and euery thynge in it ordred to the best and goodlyest ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner. To whome he sayd. This nyghte wyll I soupe with the. She answered I graunt with all myne herte / and what soeuer thou wylte haue I shall glad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly prepare. Thus goynge hande in hande they came vnto her hous where as were many wenches of lyke dysposycyon. Souper was prepared and this vnkno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen geste sate with fayre Katheryne / the one dranke to the other. But euery thynge that this strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge geste touched were it drynke or other thynge lyke / anone turned in to blody colour w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a meruayllous excellent smell &amp; swete sauour. She meruaylynge sayd to hym Syr what arte thou / eyther it is not well w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me elles thou arte very meruaylous / for euery thinge that thou
<pb facs="tcp:90:23"/>
touchest is anone made of blody colour. And he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered sayenge / knowest thou not that a crysten man neyther eteth nor drynketh but that is dyed or colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the blode of cryste. Thus this woman was meruayllously abasshed of this straunger / soo moche that she fered for to touche hym. Notwithstondynge she sayd. Syr I well perceyue by your countenaunce that ye be a man of grete reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. I beseche you who be ye / and from whens come ye. To whome he sayd whan we be togyder in thy chaumbre / I shall shewe the all thyn askynges. And thus lefte in doubte of the mater? she made redy the chaumbre. This woman Katheryne wente fyrst to bedde / &amp; desyred the straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to come to bedde to her. A wonderful thynge and suche one as in maner neuer was herde of ony crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Sodeynly this straunger chaunged hymselfe in to the shappe of a lytell chylde / bare vpon his heed a crowne of thorne / vpon his sholder a crosse / and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his passyon with innumerable woundes vp on all his body / and sayd vnto Katheryne. O Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryne now leue thy folysshenes. Beholde / now thou seest the passyon of Cryste veryly as it was in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancye for the whiche thou sayd the fyrst fyfty of thy psalter I shewe vnto the / that from the fyrste houre of my concepcyon vnto my deth I bare contynually this payne in myne herte / whiche for thy sake was soo grete that yf euery lytell pece or stone of grauell
<pb facs="tcp:90:23"/>
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> see were a chylde and euery one of them had as moche payne as euer suffred al the men in the worlde at theyr deth: yet all they togyder suffre not so grete payne as I suffred for the. This woman was sore abasshed seynge and herynge this wonder. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none agayne he was tourned in to the lykenes of a man euen after the same fourme whiche he had the tyme of his passyon royall. And sayde Doughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde now thou seest how grete paynes I suffered for the / whiche dooth excede all the paynes of helle / for my power of suffrynge is of god and not of man. And my passyon was so grete that yf it had ben de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyded amonge all creatures of the worlde / they shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de all haue dyed or ben dystroyed. After this seynge he chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged hymselfe in to the clerenes of the sonne / notwithstandynge the tokens of his passyon remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge also gloryously he apered / in all his woundes were sene al and infynyte creatures of the worlde for compassyon of the same and he sayd vnto her.</p>

            <p>BEholde / take hede / now thou seest what I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my godhede for thyn helth / syth all thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges be in me and I in euery thynge / in all these I se the / I loue the / &amp; in them all I am redy to suffre eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nally the payne for thy soules helth whiche thou seest for my loue is infynyte (after saynt Dyonyse) and all thynges in me be infynyte as the same Dyonyse she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth.
<pb facs="tcp:90:24"/>
Therfore knowe the mekenes of god / and call to mynde the threfolde passyon of cryste / for the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thou sayd thryse fyfty Aues / and fyftene Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. And here after amende thy selfe / that as thou were before the example of all malyce and vnclene ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uynge / soo now from this tyme forwarde lyue in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che maner that thou may be to all other a myrrour of purete and clennes. I do not appere to the for thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytes but onely for an example of penaunce / and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thy brethren and systers of myn vndefyled mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders fraternyte haue prayed for the / that by thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersacyon many sholde be conuerted and be the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of god / lyke as before innumerable were made the chyldren of the deuyll by thy wyckednes. what more. This vysyon vanysshed awaye. It was also vnfayned / for the woman afterwarde felte in her han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des and fete the sorowe of crystes passyon / and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes of her body. Therfore she rose from synne &amp; toke her to penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / and on the morowe after made her confessyon to saynt Domynyk / to whome he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned in penaunce to saye the psalter of the blessyd vyrgyn Marye as she was wonte to doo and to be one of her fraternyte / whyche she had not before in dede / but onely in purpose and entent / as it is afore sayd / where it is to be noted how moche this sayd fraternyte is worth to them whiche haue it in dede / syth it was soo grete valure to this woman hauynge it but in purpose / whyles that she prayed deuoutely vnto this vyrgyn Marye / the same blessyd lady ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered to her with saynt Katheryne sayenge to her.
<pb facs="tcp:90:25"/>
Doughter beholde / take hede / thou hast synned mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: therfore thou must suffre grete penaunce for this cause / take in penaunce euery daye thre dyscyplynes or thre correccyons / wherof euery one shall be of .lv. strokes whiche make a penyte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cyall psalter. She sayd also / it shall not alwaye nede to haue a rodde / but pryc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke the with thy nayles / or pynche thy flesshe in euery place. Thou mayst at all tymes doo this penaunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenst euery wycked temptacyon and for to obteyne all goodnes / and this is a royall preuy penaunce and naturall. It may be called the quene of all penaunces. This woman herde all these wordes and fulfylled them in dede. And as she was thus dayly penytent: vpon a tyme saynt Domynyk auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by the power of god sawe in the nyght a wonderfull thynge to all the worlde. He perceyued that from the hous of this same Katheryne yssued out .lv. flodes from the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of a lytell chylde / whiche flodes descended to hell in whose comynge the soules there to be purged were gretely comforted. O how grete and Ioyfull noyses made they than: how many blessynges gaue they vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to this sayd Katheryne: veryly the erth sounded agay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to theyr voyces for Ioye. There were soules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered / comforted / made hole &amp; excluded from theyr paynes by the medytacyon that Katheryne had of cry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes passyon in his chyldehode. She was alwaye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute to applye it to the comforte of all true crysten sou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les departed out of this worlde. O meruaylous thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge. After this saynt Domynyk sawe a man entre in to Katheryns chaumbre / &amp; from .v. fountaynes of his
<pb facs="tcp:90:25"/>
body yssewed out .lv. woundes whiche nourysshed and watred all the chyrche mylytante / and also this present worlde / trees and plantes dyde burgyn / byr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and fysshes were quyckened / true crysten people were bathed in those flodes. O how grete swetenes was there and how grete worldly gladnes. All crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures blessyd this woman Katheryne and prayed for her to almyghty god maker of all thynges. And these two meruaylles were shewed for the fyrst fyfty and the seconde. And where as this penytent Katheryne began the thyrde fyfty of her psalter. Saynt Domy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyk sawe a meruaylous grete gyaunt clerer than the lyght / of whome yssewed out fyue fountaynes / of the fyue fountaynes sprange fyfty flodes whiche neyther descended to therth / nor to hell / but meruayllously as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended togyder vnto heuen. And by them all heuenly paradyse was watred. Theyr swetenes was so gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te that the aungelles and holy sayntes dyde drynke of theym / gyuynge grete thankes to almyghty god. whan saynt Domynyck sawe all these meruaylles as Thomas of the temple wryteth: he meruaylled gretly why they sholde be shewed and done in the hous of so grete a synner. To whome marye the vyrgyn ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and sayd. O my frende Domynyk why doost thou meruayle in suche causes? Knowest thou not I am a frende to all synners and that the mekenes of god is in me? It was my wyll to shewe these vysy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the of this my doughter that thou sholde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che them to the worlde / for this entent that no crysten persone be theyr synnes neuer so grete sholde dyspay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re in ony condycyon / but alwaye trust in god and his
<pb facs="tcp:90:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mercy / and namely they that wyll flee vnder my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teccyon with this woman Katheryne the holy vyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn and martyr saynt Katheryne socoured her very moche whiche alwaye she loued and serued with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me prayer from her yonge aege / for the congruence of the name. More ouer the blessyd moder of god sayd. O Domynyk thou haste sene these meruaylles. Here now and preche that I soo holy and meke shall saye. Shewe that I haue purchased of my sone to all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as sayth my psalter and are of my fraternyte / they shall haue the same excellence whiche the sayd Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryne hath / &amp; though they can not se it in this worlde lyke wyse as men can not se god / his aungelles / the deuylles neyther theyr merytes and vertues in this lyfe. Also they can not se the vertue of a precyous stone nor of the sterres: therfore the knowlege of heuenly thynges must be moche ferther from them. Notwith sto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dynge they shall beholde this excellence after theyr deth. Therfore Domynyk be of good comforte / pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che my psalter and my fraternyte / for vnto all suche as hath them I haue purchased not onely to se this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence but also to haue it eternally in possessyon. what sholde I saye more. Saynt Domynyck gaue thankes to almyghty god for his grete mercy. And this Katheryne made herselfe a recluse / she dystrybu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her goodes to the poore people / whiche afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de was of so grete holynes that many very holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones came vnto her bycause of her godly reuelacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To whome appered our lorde Ihesu .C. dayes &amp; fyfty before her departynge out of this lyfe shewyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge the tyme of her deth / whiche afterwarde departed

All crysten people by this take hede of how grete ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue the psalter of our lady is with the remembraunce of crystes passyon / it is alwaye in strength bothe in lyf and at the houre of deth.
