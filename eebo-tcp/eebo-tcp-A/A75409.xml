         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Believe that it was never heard of until now, that heavy Imputations were laid on any Man (I ſpeak not, now, of KINGS, which I confeſſe makes the Caſe, yet, more ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt) and He not permitted to ſee, much leſſe to Anſwer them: but ſo it is now with the KING: which does (though ſilently) yet ſubject Him to as great an Imputation, as there is any in the ſaid Declaration; for thoſe who know no better, may think that He cannot, becauſe He does not, Anſwer it: Wherefore I hold it my Duty (knowing theſe things better then every ordinary Man) to do my beſt, that the KING ſhould not be injured, by the ignorance of His People; and albeit, I (lying under Perſecution, for my Conſcience, and Love to Regall Authority) have not the means, in every thing, to make full Probations; yet, I am confident, in all the moſt materiall Points, ſo to make the Truth, of the KINGS Innocency, appear; that I ſhall ſatisfie any Impartiall judicious Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:116434:3"/>What the Iſſue of <hi>former Addreſſes</hi> to the KING hath been, is moſt certainly known to all the World; but, where the Fault reſts, whereby Peace hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, bare Aſſeverations, without Proofes, cannot, I am ſure, ſatisfie any Judicious Reader. And indeed, it ſeems to me, that the Penner of this, ſeeks more to take the Eares of the Ignorant Multitude, with big Words, and bold Aſſertions, then to ſatisfie Rationall Men with reall Proofs or true Arguments. For, at the very firſt, he begs the Queſtion; tak<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng it for granted, that the KING could eaſe the <hi>Sighes</hi> and <hi>Groanes,</hi> dry the <hi>Teares,</hi> and ſtanch the <hi>Blood</hi> of His diſtreſſed Subjects: Alas! Is it He, that keeps Armies on foot, when there is none to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? Is it He, that will not lay down Exciſe, Taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and free-Quarterings? But, it is He indeed, who was ſo far from Power, even at that time, (being far worſe ſince) that, in moſt things, He wanted the Liberty of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny free-born Man: It is He, who never refuſed to eaſe His People of their Grievances; witneſſe more Acts of Grace paſſed in His Reigne, then (to ſpeak within my compaſſe) in any five Kings or Queens Times, that ever were before Him: Moreover, It is He, who, to ſettle the preſent unhappy Diſtractions, and (as the beſt means to it) to obtain a Perſonall Treaty, hath offered ſo much; that (to ſay Truth) during His own Time, He hath left Himſelf little more then the Title of a KING; as it plainly appears by His Meſſage from the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> and chooſing the Officers of State, and Privy-Counſellours; beſides other points of Complyance, which is needleſſe here to mention.</p>
            <p>Good God! are theſe <hi>Offers, unfit for them to receive?</hi> have they <hi>tendred ſuch Propoſitions, that might occaſion the World to judge that they have yeilded up, not only their</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:116434:3"/>
               <hi>Wills and Affections, but their Reaſons alſo, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for obtaining a true Peace or good Accommodation?</hi> It is true, that if they can ſhew, what, Reaſonably, they could have asked more; or, wherein the KING'S Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were deficient (either in Point of Security, or, by with-holding, from any of His Subjects, a jot of their juſt Priviledges) then, they ſaid ſomewhat, to challenge Belief: But, bare Aſſeverations, even againſt what a Man ſees, will not get credit with any, but ſuch who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon their Judgments to an Implicit Faith: Nor can the Determinations of all the Parlaments in the World, make a thing Juſt or Neceſſary, if it be not ſo of it ſelf: And can it be imagined, that any, who were ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Paſſages at the <hi>Treaties,</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> will believe (though it be ſaid) That <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions tendred at</hi> Newcaſtle, <hi>were the ſame in effect, which had been preſented to the King before, in the midſt of all His Strength and Forces?</hi> Indeed methinks ſuch groſſe ſlips as theſe, ſhould, at leaſt, make a Man be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, how to believe ſuch things, for which he ſees no Proofs; And yet it ſhould ſeem, that a Man muſt either take their Words, for good Payment, or remain unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; for a little after, it is ſaid, That <hi>the Kings ſtrange, unexpected, and conditionall Anſwers or Denials might juſtly have made them conſider ſome other courſe for Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Kingdome in Peace and Safety, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Application;</hi> but never ſhowes, wherein the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of His Anſwers or Denials conſiſts: And I ſhould think, that thoſe Reaſons, upon which the laying by of a Kings Authority is grounded (for it is no leſſe) ought to be particularly mentioned, for the Worlds ſatisfaction, and not involved in generall big Words: for it thereby ſeems, that it is their Force of Armes, more then that of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116434:4"/>
Reaſon, which they truſt to, for procuring of Obedience to their Determinations, or Belief to what they ſay: Otherwayes, can it be imagined, that their ſaying, That <hi>their laſt Propoſitions were to be qualified, that (where it might ſtand with the Publick ſafety) the wonted Scruples and Objections were prevented or removed,</hi> can give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to any Rationall Man, who hath ſeen all their former Propoſitions? for, it is moſt evident, that their Demands have alwaies encreaſed with their good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>And for their great Condeſcention to a <hi>Perſonal Treaty</hi> (which, under favour, can ſcarcely be called ſo; for the KING, though He had granted what was deſired, was not to come, neither to nor near <hi>London,</hi> but to ſtay in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and there to Treat with <hi>Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>) upon Signing the Four Bils; Surely, they incurred therein, but little danger; for it is moſt evident, that they containe the very ſubſtance of the moſt eſſentiall parts of their Demands; which being once granted, the KING would neither have had Power to Deny, nor any thing left worth the refuſing; for after He had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that He had taken up Armes, to invade the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his People, (whereas it was only for the Defence of His own Rights) and had likewiſe Condemned all thoſe, who had faithfully ſerved Him, of Rebellion; and that He had totally deveſted Himſelf, his Heires, and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours for ever, of the Power of the Sword; whereby the Protection of His Subjects (which is one of the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall and neceſſary Rights belonging to Regall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) is totally torne away from the Crown: and that by a ſilent Confeſſion, He had done Himſelf and Succeſſours, an irrepairable prejudice concerning the Great Seal (I ſpeak not of the other two Bills, neither
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116434:4"/>
of which are of little importance) what was there more for Him to grant (worth the inſiſting upon) after ſuch Conceſſions? or, indeed, what Power was left Him to deny any thing? So that the KING'S neceſſity of giving the Anſwer He did (for it was no abſolute Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall) is moſt evident; unleſſe, He had reſolved to have lived in quiet, without Honour; and to have given His People Peace, without Safety; by Abandoning them to an Arbitrary and unlimited Power of the Two Houſes, for ever, concerning the Levying of Land or Sea Forces, without ſtinting of Numbers, or diſtinction of Perſons; and for Payments, to levy ſuch ſummes of Monies, in ſuch ſort, and by ſuch waies and means, as they ſhall think fit and appoint. And now, I cannot but ask; Is this the <hi>Militia,</hi> that the KING contends for? or, did ever any King of <hi>England</hi> pretend to, or ſeek for, ſuch a Power? ſurely no: But, this is a new <hi>Militia,</hi> and take heed, leſt this ſhould prove like the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Praetorian Cohorts,</hi> that what they did in chooſing and changing Emperours, theſe do not to this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by moulding and altering it according to their Fancies. Now, my eagerneſſe to clear this Point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the four Bills, had almoſt made me forget, a moſt materiall Queſtion: I wonder much wherein the <hi>Danger</hi> conſiſts of a <hi>Perſonall Treaty</hi> with the KING, ever ſince He was laſt at <hi>Newcaſtle?</hi> Surely He cannot bring Forces along with Him, to awe His Two Houſes of Parlament: and it is as well known that He hath not Mony to raiſe an Army: and truly, there is as little fear, that the Eloquence of His Tongue ſhould work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; but on the Contrary, if He were ſo ill a Man, as you deſcribe Him to be, whatſoever He ſhal ſay or write, muſt more prejudice <hi>Him</hi> then You: for let Him never
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116434:5"/>
flatter Himſelf; it muſt be clear, not doubtfull, Reaſon, that can prevaile againſt that great viſible prevailing Power, which now oppoſes Him: nor do I ſay, it will; but certainly, leſſe cannot doe it: Where is then, the <hi>Danger?</hi> Believe it, Reaſon will hardly maintain thoſe who are affraid of her.</p>
            <p>After this, it is ſaid, That <hi>they had Cauſe enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the</hi> KING <hi>ſometimes denied to receive their humble Petitions:</hi> but, they neither tell, where, nor when; which, I am moſt confident, they cannot: but I am certain, that the KING hath ſent divers Meſſages of Peace to them, unto which, He hath yet, had no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; namely, His laſt from <hi>Oxford</hi> of the 15. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1645. and all the reſt ſince: As for the Fight at <hi>Brainceford,</hi> whoſoever will read the Collection of the Declarations in Print, upon that ſubject, will clearly find, that the KING hath more Reaſon to complain, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of Treaty, ſought to environ Him with their Forces; then they, for what He then did; and His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat was neither for <hi>Feare,</hi> nor with <hi>Shame;</hi> for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the Enemy made Him retard, not haſten His Orders for retiring, which divers howers (before their appearing) He had given: which He did without any loſſe at all, but (on the contrary) Retreated with more Armes, Eleven Colours, and fifteen pieces of Ordnance (beſide good ſtore of Ammunition) then He had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and for Cruelty; there was not a drop of Bloud ſhed, but in the heat of the Fight, for I ſaw above five hundred Priſoners, who (only promiſing, <hi>never after, to beare Armes againſt the</hi> KING) were freely Releaſed.</p>
            <p>Again, they ſeem to have good Memories, ſaying, <hi>That the King once ſent them a ſpecious Meſſage of renewing a Treaty, when at the ſame time, His Meſſenger was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:116434:5"/>
               <hi>how to manage that bloody Maſſacre in</hi> London, <hi>which was then Deſign'd by vertue of the Kings Commiſsion, ſince publiſhed:</hi> And hath the KING ſent but one Meſſage, for the renewing of a Treaty? Then what was that from <hi>Taveſtock</hi> in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1644. and <note n="*" place="margin">5. 15. 26. 29. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> and 15. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1645.</note> five others from <hi>Oxford</hi> the next Yeare? But indeed this, that is here mentioned, they knew not how to Anſwer (for at that time, they knew not the way of Silence) but by this forged Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation againſt the Meſſenger; who, I dare ſay, knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that, which might have been (at that time) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the KING'S ſervice, by ſome who had more Zeale then Judgment: But, that there was a <hi>Maſſacre</hi> intended, or, that any <hi>Commiſsion from the</hi> KING, ſhould countenance ſuch a Deſigne, is a moſt notorious Slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. As for the KING'S mentioned Letter to the QUEENE; I am confident that any judicious Reader, will find the Gloſſe made upon it, very much wreſted: And certainly, after-Ages will think theſe Times very Barbarous, wherein private Letters betwixt Man and Wife are publiſhed to open view: and in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, there is ſuch Reſpect carried to private Letters of Princes, that (to my knowledge) the laſt <hi>Emperour</hi> in the greateſt heat of the <hi>Bohemian Warre,</hi> having intercepted a Packet, wherein were private Letters to King JAMES of bleſſed Memory (who was then known, no great Friend to the <hi>Emperour</hi>) from His onely Daughter, then, avowedly the <hi>Emperours</hi> greateſt Enemy; yet He ſent them to the KING, without the leaſt offer of violence to the Scales.</p>
            <p>And now I come to their Determination upon the whole Matter, what Courſe they have reſolved to take with the KING: their words are; <hi>But notwithſtanding this and other former Tenders, we have now received ſuch</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:116434:6"/>
               <hi>a Denyall that we are in Deſpaire of any good by Addreſſes to the</hi> KING; <hi>neither muſt we be ſo injurious to the People in further delaying their Setlement, as any more to preſſe His Conſent to theſe, or any other Propoſitions:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is <hi>Reſolved upon the Queſtion: That they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no more any Meſſage from the King;</hi> and do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne, <hi>That no Perſons do preſume, to receive or bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Meſſage from the King to both or either Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament or to any other Perſon.</hi> Thus you ſee, that the KING is laid by; but, that is not all; for, He muſt, neither juſtifie His Innocency againſt Calumny, nor is there any way left Him to mend any Errour, that He may have committed: Is this a Juſt way of proceeding? when Truth, though offered, muſt not be heard; and that no way muſt be left to recant an Error? And why all this Severity? Becauſe (as I have already ſhown you) the KING will not injure His Conſcience or Honour, nor ſuffer His People to be oppreſſed; to which they give the Terme of <hi>ſuch a Denyall,</hi> though really it was none. But ſince they thus ſeek to hoodwink the People; it is no great Wonder, that they forbid the KING to repent Him of thoſe Faults, which He never committed: and I believe all Indifferent Men, will eaſily judge of the KING'S Innocency, even by their way of Accuſation: for, thoſe who wil lay ſuch High Crimes to His charge, as the <hi>breach of Oaths, Vows, Proteſtations,</hi> and <hi>Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> would not ſpare to bring their Proofs if they had any: But on the Contrary it is known to all the World, that He had not ſuffer'd, as He ha's done, if He would have diſpenſed with that part of His <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> which He made to the <hi>Clergy;</hi> which is no great ſigne that He makes ſlight of His Engagements: of which it is ſo univerſally knowne, that He ha's been ſo Religiouſly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116434:6"/>
Carefull, as I hold it a wrong to His Innocency, to ſeek to clear Him of ſuch Slaunders, for which there are no Proofs alledged; for, Malice being once detected, is beſt Anſwered, with Neglect and Silence: And was there ever greater, or more apparent, Malice, then to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to put the horrid ſlaunder of Paricide upon Him, who was eminently known to be as obedient and loving a Son to His bleſſed Father, as any Hiſtory can make mention of? But indeed the loſſe of <hi>Rochell</hi> doth fitly follow; to ſhow, how Malice, when it is at the height, is ordinarily accompanied; for there are none, but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or forgetfull Men, who know not that it was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the want of Aſſiſtance, from the Two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament (contrary to their Publick Generall Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that loſt <hi>Rochell:</hi> and there is nothing more clear (to any who hath known French Occurrences) then, that reall Aſſiſtance, which the KING, to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of His Power, gave to thoſe of the <hi>Religion,</hi> at that time, made the Cardinall of <hi>Richelieu</hi> an irreconcileable enemy to the KING; wherefore I cannot but ſay, that it is a ſtrange forgetfull Boldneſſe to charge the KING with that which was evidently other mens faults.</p>
            <p>There are alſo other things, that, to any knowing Man, will rather ſeem Jeers, then Acuſations; as the <hi>German Horſe,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Fleet in the yeare</hi> 1639. But my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhall not ſo blind me, as to ſay, that the KING never erred; yet, as when a juſt Debt is paid, Bonds ought to be cancell'd; ſo Grievances, be they never ſo juſt, being once redreſſed, ought no more to be objected as Errours. And it is no Paradox, to affirme; that Truths, this way told, are no better then Slaunders; and ſuch are the Catalogue of Grievances here enumerated; which, when they are well examin'd, every one of them,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116434:7"/>
will not be found ſuch as here they are deſcribed to be.</p>
            <p>Now as concerning thoſe Diſcourſes which mention the Beginnings of theſe Troubles, (which are in Two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places of this Declaration) I will onely ſay this; that what the KING did, upon thoſe Occaſions, was meerly to defend the Rights of His Crown, which were and are evidently ſought to be torne from Him; nor can I acknowledge all thoſe Relations to be true, ſuch as <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Levies,</hi> of Men; <hi>by Popiſh Agents; Arming of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in the North, Calling in of Daniſh Forces,</hi> and the like: And as for the ſtale Slaunder of <hi>calling up the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Army,</hi> now renewed; it is well known, that the Two Houſes (even at that time) were not ſo partiall to the KING, as to have conceal'd a Practiſe of that kind, if they could have got it ſufficiently proved.</p>
            <p>But, if the <hi>Iriſh Rebellion</hi> can be juſtly charged upon the KING, then I ſhall not blame any for beleeving all the reſt of the Allegations againſt Him; onely I proteſt againſt all <hi>Rebells</hi> Teſtimonie, as good Proofe; it being moſt certaine by experience; that they, who make no Conſcience of Rebelling, will make leſſe of Lying, when it is for their Advantage. And, it is no little wonder, that, ſo grave an Aſſembly as the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> ſhould ſo ſlightly examine a Buſineſſe of that Great Weight, as to alleage, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Great Seale, did countenance the Iriſh Rebellion, when I know it can be proved, by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes without exception, that, for many Moneths before, untill the now Lord Chancellour had the Keeping of it, there was nothing at all Sealed by it: Nor concerning this Great Point will I onely ſay, that the KING is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and bid them prove (which, to moſt Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is a ſufficient Anſwer) but, I can prove, that if the KING had been obeyed in the Iriſh Affaires before He
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116434:7"/>
went laſt into <hi>Scotland,</hi> there had been no <hi>Iriſh Rebellion;</hi> and, after it was begun, it had, in few Months, been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, if His Directions had been obſerved; For if the KING had been ſuffered to have performed His Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the <hi>Iriſh Agents;</hi> and, had diſpoſed of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented <hi>Iriſh Army,</hi> beyond Sea (according to His Contracts with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadours) there is nothing more cleare, then that there could have been no Rebellion in <hi>Ireland;</hi> becauſe, they had wanted both Pretence and Meanes, to have made one: Then, when it was broken forth, if thoſe vigorous courſes had been purſued, which the KING propoſed, (firſt to the <hi>Scots,</hi> then, to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parlament) doubtleſſe that Rebellion had been ſoon ſuppreſſed. But what He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed took ſo little effect, that in many months after, there was nothing ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but what the KING Himſelfe ſent (aſſiſted by the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi>) before He came from <hi>Scotland,</hi> unto Sir <hi>Rob: Steward;</hi> which, though it were little, will be found to have done much ſervice, as may be ſeen by the ſaid Sir <hi>Roberts</hi> voluntary Teſtimony, given in writing to the Parlament Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners then attending the KING at <hi>Stoak.</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a greater Evidence for Conſtancy in Religion there cannot be, then the KING ſhewed in His <hi>Iriſh Treaty;</hi> for, in the time that He moſt needed Aſſiſtance, it was in His Power to have made that Kingdome Declare unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly for Him, and have had the whole Forces thereof employed in His Service, if He would have granted their Demand in Points of Religion, they not inſiſting in any thing of Civill Government, which His Majeſty might not have granted, without prejudice to Regal Authority; and this can be clearly proved, by the Marques of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> Treaties with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> not without very good

Evidence by ſome of the KING's Letters to the QUEENE, which were taken at <hi>Naſeby</hi> that are purpoſely concealed, leſt they ſhould too plainly diſcover the KING'S deteſtation of that Rebellion, and His rigid firmneſſe to the Proteſtant Profeſſion: Nor can I end this Point, without remarking with Wonder, that Men ſhould have ſo ill Memories, as again to renew that old Slander, of the <hi>King's giving Paſſes, to divers Papiſts, and Perſons of Quality, who headed the Rebels;</hi> of which He ſo cleared Himſelfe, that He demanded Reparation for it, but could not have it, albeit no ſhew of Proof could be produced, for that Allegation: as is moſt plainly to be ſeen in the firſt book of the Collection of all Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, Declarations, &amp;c. fol. 69. &amp; 70.</p>
            <p>Thus having given a particular Anſwer to the moſt materiall Points in this Declaration, the reſt are ſuch fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, malicious, and many of them groundleſſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, that Contempt is the Beſt Anſwer for them. Yet, one thing more, I muſt obſerve, that they not onely endeavour to make Fables paſſe for currant Coyne, but likewiſe ſeek to blind Mens Judgements, with falſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences upon ſome Truths: for Example; It is true, that <hi>the KING hath ſaid in ſome of His Speeches or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; That He oweth an Accompt of His Actions to none but God alone; and That the Houſes of Parlament joynt or ſeperate have no Power, either to make or Declare any Law;</hi> But, that this is <hi>a fit foundation for all Tyrannie,</hi> I muſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Deny; indeed if it had been ſaid, that <hi>the King, without the Two Houſes of Parlament, could make or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Lawes,</hi> then there might be ſome ſtrength in the Argument; but, before this Parlament, it was never, ſo much as Pretended, that either or both Houſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the KING, could make or Declare any Law, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116434:9"/>
HIS MAJESTY is not the firſt (and I hope will not be the laſt) King of <hi>England,</hi> that hath not held Himſelf Accomptable to any Earthly Power; beſides it will be found, that this HIS MAJESTY'S Poſition is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all Divine and Humane Lawes; ſo far it is, from being <hi>Deſtructive to a Kingdome,</hi> or <hi>a Foundation for Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</hi> To conclude, I appeale to GOD, and the World, whether it can be parallel'd by example, or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Juſtice, that any Man ſhould be Slander'd, yet denyed the ſight thereof; and ſo far from being permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Anſwer, that if He have erred, there is no way left Him to acknowledge or mend it: and yet this is the KING'S preſent Condition; who is, at this time, laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; Becauſe He will not conſent that the old Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Lawes of this Land be changed, Regall Power deſtroyed, nor, His People ſubmitted, to a new Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Tyrannicall Government.</p>
