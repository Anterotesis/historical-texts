            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Beleeve me, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Benlowes,</hi> I have had such experience of this party, whom here I commend unto you, that I dare confidently say, If you entertain him into your service, you shall never repent you of it. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> appointed one every Morning to salute him with a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi> of <hi>Mortalitie: Drexelius</hi> his office shall be, if you please, To be your <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> and every Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Noon, and Evening, to round you in the eare with a <hi>Memento</hi> of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> But, I know, That is so often in your thoughts, that you need not any to put you in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it. Neither yet do I intend here, though I have a fair
<pb facs="tcp:25492:6"/>
occasion, to run over the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of your <hi>Christian Vertues,</hi> specially that pair of Christian twins, your <hi>Pietie</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> with your <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Bounty.</hi> For the first, they that daily converse with you cannot but see how you converse with them. The other pair go along with you wheresoever you go, and though you desire to hide them, cannot be concealed: in speciall many poore Scholars, <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Ministers</hi> in the <hi>Universitie,</hi> and <hi>abroad,</hi> of severall <hi>Colledges,</hi> have had a feeling themselves of them, and cannot but make them conspicuous nay palpable to others. These shall praise you in your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: for my part, I do not love to praise a man to his face. But if the <hi>living</hi> hold their peace, the <hi>dead</hi> shall rise up and praise you, I mean those <hi>many</hi> and <hi>excellent books</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other <hi>rare monuments</hi> purchased at a great price, which without any sollicitation at all, out of meere affection you bore to Saint <hi>Johns Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where you were sometimes a <hi>Student,</hi> you
<pb facs="tcp:25492:6"/>
have bestowed on their <hi>Librarie:</hi> Their <hi>Librarie,</hi> but the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent work, and <hi>Eternall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument</hi> of the <hi>Mecoenas</hi> of our age, <hi>John Lord Bishop of Lincoln,</hi> the true lover of learning, and Patron of Scholars. And now it appeares, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Benlowes,</hi> that you have lesse need of <hi>Drexelius</hi> his service, then before. But howsoever, I pray you, entertain him: Let him have but the honour to weare your <hi>Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance:</hi> And both <hi>He</hi> and <hi>I</hi> will put it upon the file of <hi>Thankfull Remembrance,</hi> and register it for a singular act of your <hi>Beneficence.</hi> Pardon my boldnesse in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And command me in what liberall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you please.</p>

But the knowledge of this cost me so deare, that I was forced to leave the studie of it: For many nights together I was constrained against my will to practise <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> oftener then I would, telling the Clock, and could take but little rest. Whereupon I resolved with my self to leave the <hi>Arithmetick School,</hi> and so I went unto the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:25492:8"/>
and <hi>Musick Schools,</hi> imploring at one and the same time the help of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and the <hi>Muses.</hi> For at that time I turned the first book of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his <hi>Aphorismes</hi> into Greek verses, hoping to procure rest by <hi>Physick</hi> and the <hi>Musick</hi> of <hi>Poeticall Numbers;</hi> by which I found some rest indeed (And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since I have well-nigh finished at spare houres the other six books, which, if God permit, may ere long see light.) But though I found some rest, yet I did not sleep so soundly as at other times. So I left the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and the <hi>Muses,</hi> and betook my self into the <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> to learn of <hi>David</hi> divine <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> which consisteth in the due numbring of the dayes of this short life, by comparing them with the yeares of <hi>Eternitie:</hi> And so I fell upon translating this book of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> And this I found by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience to be the best <hi>Hypno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticon</hi> that ever I used; For it brought me to my rest better then if I had taken <hi>Diacodion.</hi> Thus I found the old saying true, <hi>Where
<pb facs="tcp:25492:9"/>
Philosophie ends, there Physick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins; and where Physick ends, there Divinitie begins;</hi> which I interpret thus, (as I found it true by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) <hi>When Philosophie by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had done me harm, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick could do me little good, I found perfect help in Divinitie.</hi> And having found so much good by this book my self, I could not be so envious as not impart it unto others for a <hi>Soveraigne Medicine, to</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure quiet sleep. Neither is it good for that onely, but (Farre unlike to other Medicines, which are onely good for some one disease, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into unskilfull hands often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time do more harm then good) It is a <hi>Medicine</hi> fitting <hi>All Ages, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, Conditions, Places, Parts, Diseases Spirituall and Corporall</hi> whatsoever: It is a <hi>Medicine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative, Curative, Restaurative:</hi> It is an <hi>Antidote</hi> against the <hi>poyson</hi> of sinne: It is <hi>Dictamnum</hi> to drive out the fierie <hi>darts</hi> of <hi>Satan:</hi> It is <hi>Catholicon</hi> to purge out all ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. It is better then <hi>Exhilarans Galeni,</hi> to cheare the Heart oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

So I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee to the <hi>Physician</hi> both of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> and heartily desire thy <hi>Temporall</hi> and <hi>Eternall</hi> Health and Welfare.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> What men of former times have thought of Eternitie, and how they have represented it.</head>
               <p>FIrst of all, they have represented <hi>Eternitie</hi> by a <hi>Ring,</hi> or a <hi>Circle,</hi> which hath neither beginning nor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25492:16"/>
ending, which is proper onely to <hi>Gods Eternitie.</hi> Seeing therefore that God is <hi>Eternall,</hi> and his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is properly called <hi>Eternitie,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> used to signifie <hi>God</hi> by a <hi>Circle.</hi> And the <hi>Persians</hi> thought they honoured <hi>God</hi> most, when going up to the top of the highest tower, they called him <hi>the Circle of heaven.</hi> And it was a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome amongst the Turks (as <hi>Pieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> teacheth at large) to cry out eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning from an high tower, <hi>God alwayes was, and alwayes will be;</hi> and then to salute their <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi> The <hi>Saracens</hi> also used to call <hi>God a Circle. Mercurius Trismegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> whom I named before, the most memorable amongst Philosophers, (who wrote more books then any mortall man beside, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and <hi>Meneceus</hi>) said, that God was an intellectual <hi>sphere,</hi> whose <hi>centre</hi> is every where, and <hi>circumference</hi> no where: because Gods Majestie and immensitie are terminated no where. For this cause the Ancients built unto their gods, Temples for figure <hi>round.</hi> So <hi>Numa
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:25492:17"/>
Pompilius</hi> is said to have consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Vesta</hi> a <hi>round Temple</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> So <hi>Augustus Cesar</hi> in the name of <hi>Agrippa</hi> dedicated to all the gods a <hi>round Temple,</hi> and called it <hi>Pantheon.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> to shew <hi>Gods Eternitie,</hi> teached his scholars to worship him, turning their bodies round about. And there was a statute made by <hi>Numa,</hi> (as <hi>Brissonius</hi> witnesseth) That they which were about to worship God, should turn themselves round. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God</hi> is, according to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, a <hi>Circle,</hi> but a <hi>Circle</hi> without a <hi>Peripherie</hi> or <hi>circumference,</hi> whose <hi>Centre is</hi> every where: because God is the beginning and end of all things. Whereupon <hi>Job</hi> most just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Job 6. 26.</note> cryes out, <hi>Behold God is great, &amp; we know him not, neither can the number of his yeares be searched out</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, they have represented <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie</hi> by a <hi>Sphere</hi> and a <hi>Globe.</hi> Therefore <hi>Faustina</hi> the Empresse had money stampt after this figure and superscription; There was a <hi>Globe,</hi> on which the Empresse sat stretching forth one hand, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25492:17"/>
in the other a <hi>sceptre</hi> with this inscription, ETERNITIE. Hence it was that many of the Ancients thought the world to be <hi>Eternall,</hi> because it was <hi>Round:</hi> whom S. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> answers very fitly, <hi>Let the world be a Circle; but the beginning of the Circle, is the Centre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented <hi>Eternitie</hi> by a <hi>Seat:</hi> by which is signified <hi>Eternall rest.</hi> The <hi>Nasamones,</hi> a certain people of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> for the most part did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breathe out their last, sitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a seat, but also desired to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after that position, as having then attained to <hi>Eternitie,</hi> and a long cessation from all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: As in many places at this day Kings and Emperours are found sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in vaults under earth, in silence and mournfull majestie. And it was usuall with the <hi>Romanes</hi> to support with such like the molten statues of their deceased Emperours, as having then the fruition of <hi>Eternity.</hi> Some there are that thus reason with themselves oftentimes: Behold! I have been a long time held and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25492:18"/>
with cares and labours: But now why do I not take some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite? why do I not make some pause? why do I not rest from my labours? I have laboured long enough: let others labour as much as I have done; for my part I'le rest now, and take mine ease. So they set up their seats, and promise unto themselves dayes of rest: But (alas!) they are of no long continuance: They set up their seats, and embrace their ease; but neither in due time nor place.

Therefore we must set up our seat in heaven, and not here: for here amongst so

many troubles it can never stand quiet; and though all other things should spare it, yet death at length will overturn it. There is no true rest to be hoped for, but that which is <hi>Eternall.</hi> But if there be any rest in this life, this is it, For a man to commit himself, and all that is his to the will of God, to put his whole trust and confidence in him, and to account all other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, but vain.

               <p>In the fourth place they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented <hi>Eternitie</hi> by the <hi>Sunne</hi> and the <hi>Moon.</hi> The <hi>Sunne</hi> revives every day, although it seems every day to die, and to be buried.

               <p>In Hell there is <hi>Eternall night,</hi> but without sleep: There they sleep not, because they slept here, where they should have watched: there they watch, because here they slept in their sinnes; indeed not long, but longer they would if they could, yea <hi>Eternally.</hi> But it is farre otherwise with those that are in heaven: For a perpetuall light shall shine forth to the Saints, and Eternitie of time: there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is rest; there, is pleasure after long labours and watchings.</p>
               <p>In the fifth place they have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented <hi>Eternitie</hi> by the <hi>Basilisk.</hi> The <hi>Basilisk</hi> is the most venimous of all creatures, and it alone of all others (as <hi>Horus Niliacus</hi> saith) cannot be killed by humane force; yea it is so virulent, that it killeth herbs with the very breath of it,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25492:19"/>
that it puts to flight all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with the hissing of it, &amp; that it makes all birds suddenly silent, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first presence of it. <hi>AElianus</hi> reports that in the desert of <hi>Africa</hi> a certain beast fell down being ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that the Serpents came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as it were to a feast, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the carcase, and that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently ran all away and hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the sand, upon the sight of the <hi>Basilisk. Eternitie,</hi> whether of joy or of torment, cannot be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened or diminished, much lesse ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away or avoided. Neither is it strange, if it affright all that are in their right wits, with the very thought of it. Infinite are the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this <hi>Basilisk;</hi> unmeasurable, and untwinable are the <hi>orbs</hi> and <hi>circuits</hi> of it. Oh Dragon to be trembled at! Let us divert a little to our selves. It comes to passe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when a man descends into himself, and rips up his conscience by confession, that he findes many Serpents nests, and whole broods of vipers, and thereupon much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velleth in himself, saying, Whence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:25492:20"/>
is there so much venime in my breast? Whence are so many fat Snakes, so many grievous and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinnes? Whence is there so great an host of Lisards? whence so many filthy and lustfull cogitations? I am afraid my self at such a numerous and pestilent brood. But marvell not; we shall easily shew thee the cause thereof. A moyst and a rude place is very apt to breed Serpents. Lo then, there is a double cause, The moysture of the place, and the negligence of them that should look to it. So it is in the soul of man: If we spend all our care upon our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, handling it delicately, feeding it daintily, pampering it with feasts, &amp; effeminating it with pleasures: it must needs be confessed that the soul the inhabitant thereof hath her dwelling in a moyst place. Adde hither slothfulnesse, and neglect of divine duties: Let no care be had at all of salvation; so the body be sound, and it goes well with it, let no regard be had what happens to the soul; Let confession of sinnes be seldome made unto God, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25492:20"/>
when it is, but in a negligent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: What marvell then, if a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Serpents, and poysonous vermine breed there? But (O good Christian brother) Let the <hi>Basilisk</hi> enter into thy Breast, that is, the cogitation of <hi>Eternitie,</hi> and thou shalt presently perceive that these venimous beasts will soon vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Thou confessest that thy heart doth abound with these Snakes: It is a signe therefore thou seldome thinkest upon <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Amend therefore, and now at length begin to think upon this with thy self, <hi>That which delighteth is but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie, but that which torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is Eternall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the sixth place, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented <hi>Eternity</hi> after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. There is a <hi>vast den,</hi> full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: round about which a <hi>Serpent</hi> windes it self, and in the winding bites it self by the tail. At the right hand of the den stands a <hi>Young man</hi> of a beautifull and pleasant counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, holding in his right hand a <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>two arrows,</hi> and in his left hand an <hi>Harp:</hi> In the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25492:21"/>
of the den sits an <hi>Old man</hi> opposite, and having his eyes very intent upon his <hi>Table-book;</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the celestiall globe by its motion, or the young man standing by, dictates unto him, so he writes. At the left hand of the den sits a <hi>grave matron,</hi> gray-headed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her eyes alwayes busied. At the mouth of the den there are <hi>foure stairs,</hi> each higher then other: The first is of <hi>Iron,</hi> the second of <hi>Brasse,</hi> the third of <hi>Silver,</hi> &amp; the fourth of <hi>Gold:</hi> On these are little children running up and down and playing, and never fear the danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. This is the <hi>Picture:</hi> The meaning is this: The <hi>Den</hi> signifies the incomprehensibility of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:</hi> The <hi>Serpent</hi> that twines it self about it, <hi>Time:</hi> The <hi>Young man, God;</hi> in whose hand is <hi>Heaven, Earth,</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> On <hi>Earth</hi> and in <hi>Hell</hi> are the <hi>Arrows</hi> of the Lord fastened; but in <hi>Heaven</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Joy</hi> and the sounding of the <hi>Harp.</hi> The <hi>Old man is Fate,</hi> or rather, That which God hath <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed</hi> from all <hi>Eternitie:</hi> The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,

Alack! O mortal men, we have play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too long amidst these dangers: we are very neare unto <hi>Eternitie,</hi> even in the very entrance of it, whilest we live: Let but death light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch us, and we are presently swallowed up of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Death need not use any great power, or fight long against us: we are thrown down headlong in a moment, and tumble down these stairs into the <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Bethink your selves well, you that play upon these stairs, and think upon any thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then upon <hi>Eternitie;</hi> It may be <hi>to day,</hi> or <hi>to morrow</hi> you may be translated from <hi>Time</hi> to <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>

When <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> had cast the three Hebrew children into the fiery furnace for refusing to obey his impious command, the flame is said to have ascended nine and fourty cubits above the furnace.

Did any man ascend and apply unto it a rule, to take the just mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of it? was it just nine and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cubits, neither more nor lesse? Why not fifty? For we use to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thus, Twenty, thirty, fourty, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though the number be somewhat more or lesse.

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Why the place of Eternitie is called a Mansion.</head>
               <p>JOHN, <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a very devout and godly man, was often wont to go to visit the sick, &amp; took with him for his companion <hi>Troilus</hi> a Bishop, which had more care of his money, then of the sick. The <hi>Patriarch</hi> whispered him in the eare and said, I pray thee, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let us help the friends of Christ: whereupon <hi>Troilus</hi> like a crafty companion concealing the disease of his mind, to wit, his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, bad his servant give to the poore, all the money which at that time he had about him to buy other things withall. Not long after it happened that he fell into a Fever which his covetousnesse had caused: whereof the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> hearing, and easily guessing at the cause of his disease, went to visit him, and carried with him as much silver, as he had not long before given to the sick: and after a little conference had with him, he said
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:25492:25"/>
thus, I did but jest with thee the other day, when I wished thee to bestow something to the relief of the sick: and it was because my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant had no money about him. But behold here in good earnest, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store unto thee the money which thou laidst out for my sake, and I thank thee for it. When <hi>Troilus</hi> saw the money told, his fever began to leave him, and his heat to abate, and in every part he found himself much better: whereupon finding himself gather strength, he rose up to dinner, and sat down at Table. About noon tide when dinner was ended, and the Table removed, he went to sleep, and sweetly took his ease, and dreamed that he saw a very stately edifice, and in the <hi>fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tispice</hi> thereof over the gate, this inscription, <hi>Mansio AEterna &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies Troili Episcopi:</hi> In English thus, <hi>The Eternall Mansion and Resting-place of Bishop Troilus.</hi> He was very much delighted with this dream. But not long after he had another vision that troubled him. For there came one with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:25492:26"/>
of workmen, and gave them a strict charge, saying, Take away that inscription, and put this in the place thereof, <hi>Mansio AEterna &amp; Requies Joannis Archiepiscopi A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandriae, empta libris triginta argenti:</hi> In English thus, <hi>The Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Mansion and Resting-place of John Archbishop of Alexandria, which he bought for thirty pounds.</hi> With this vision he was very much affrighted: but he made a very good use of it. For presently, of an hard and covetous man, he became li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall and charitable, especially to such as were in need. So much did the very dream of an <hi>Eternall Mansion</hi> prevail with him.</p>
               <p>But oh ye rather blessed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and therefore blessed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Eternall!</hi> Oh! how excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly doth Christ desire that we should loathe and forsake these our tabernacles, and ruinous houses, and with earnest desire make haste unto those <hi>Eternall Mansions!

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Why Hell is Eternall.</head>
               <p>HEre ariseth a question which is worthy to be known of all men, How it can be, that God who is good and mercifull, and whose mercy is over all his works, should notwithstanding punish even one mortall sinne, committed, it may be, in a moment, and in thought onely; How he should punish such a sinne, I say, for all <hi>Eternitie,</hi> and so punish it, that it shall deserve still alwayes to be punished, and though millions of yeares be passed, yet it shall never be said, This sinne hath been sufficiently punished, it is enough, he hath made satisfaction for the wicked thought by which he hath offended God.</p>
               <p>What then? Hath God for one sinne, and that in thought onely, decreed the punishment of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting fire? What equalitie is there in this, For a <hi>momentanie</hi> sinne, to appoint an <hi>Eternall</hi> punishment?<note place="margin">Psal. 106. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:25492:34"/>
he is good, and his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> And why doth he repeat it twenty seven times, if God be so severe? To this S. <hi>Augustine, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie, Thomas Aquinas</hi> and others answer, That in every mortall sinne the offence of its own nature is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, because it is an injury against the infinite majesty of God. Again, He that dyeth guilty of a mortall sinne without repentance, doth as much as if he should sinne <hi>Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> For if he might live <hi>Eternally,</hi> he would sinne <hi>Eternally:</hi> He hath not lost a will to sinne, but life in which to sinne, still being ready to sinne, if he might live still: So he doth not cease to sinne, but doth cease to live. Further it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, That a damned person can never make satisfaction, though he should pay never so much: For being an Enemie, and not in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, his paiment is not worthy acceptation; seeing that he himself is not accepted with him: Neither indeed, to speak truely, can he be said to pay any thing: because he doth nothing, but suffers onely
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:25492:34"/>
punishment, and that against his will. We will make the matter yet more plain by a familiar example. Suppose a man should borrow of his neighbour a thousand crowns, and for the use thereof make over the Rent of his house unto him for ever: It may be in twenty yeares he may thus repay the summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney borrowed: But what then? Is he fully discharged of all the debt? Doth there remain nothing to be paid? The Principall remains still as due to be paid, as if there had been nothing at all paid. For this is the nature of such lones, That although the yearely use be paid, still the Principall remains entire, and due to be paid. So it is with the damned: For although they should pay never so much, yet they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get out of debt. They are debters still, and ever shall be. <hi>The</hi>

               <p>BUt I return to the school of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to consider further upon <hi>Eternitie.</hi> There are found <hi>hot Baths</hi> in certain mountains and rocks, whose waters in running make such a noise and murmuring, that the diseased persons that resort thither for cure, if at their entrance into the <hi>Bath</hi> they do but imagine they heare musicall instruments and an Harmonious consort, they have their eares so dulled with the continuall noise thereof, that the Musick which at first was sweet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, becomes at length, by their imagination working upon it, very loathsome, and a torment unto them: But if they imagine they heare a drumme, or any other loud sounding instrument, they at length grow almost mad with the noise thereof daily molesting and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them. From hence also we are led, as it were by the hand, to the consideration of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> The

weeping and wailing, yelling and crying which is heard at the first entrance of Hells mouth under those infernall mountains shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cease, but shall torment the damned without end, and be no whit mitigated by time and long sufferance. But on the contrary, the blessed in heaven shall without wearinesse heare the <hi>Thrice Holy</hi> sung, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy;</hi> yea and the more they heare it, the more they shall be delighted with the sound thereof.

There was also heard noise under earth, as if it had been thunder: The sea roared and made a noise; the Heaven thundred as if mountains had in conflict met together; great stones were seen to fall; the aire was filled with smoke and fire mixt together; the Sunne did hide his head. Whereupon it was thought by many that the world was almost at an end, and that the last day was come wherein all should be consumed with fire: For there was such abundance of ashes scattered up and down over land and sea, and in the aire, that there was much hurt done amongst men and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and in the fields, that fish and fowl were destroyed, that two ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

the name of the one was <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culanum,</hi> and the name of the other <hi>Pompeii,</hi> were utterly ruined.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:25492:41"/>
To whosoevers lot fell any one of these, he presently received accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the inscription.</p>
            <p>The same <hi>Nero</hi> for a Donative to a common souldier commanded to be told, two hundred and fifty thousand crowns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippina Nero's</hi> mother cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the like summe of money to be layd upon a Table, thereby secretly reprehending, and labouring to restrain her sonnes profusenesse. Whereupon <hi>Nero</hi> perceiving that he was toucht, commanded another summe to be added as great as the former, and said thus, <hi>Nesciebam me tamparum dedisse, I forgot my self in giving so little.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same <hi>Nero</hi> entertained at <hi>Rome</hi> for nine moneths together King <hi>Teridates,</hi> and was every day at cost for him twenty thousand Crowns, which came in nine moneths to five Millions and fourty thousand Crowns. And at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he gave him for a <hi>Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,</hi> or to spend by the way, two Millions and an half. What should I tell you of their stately and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent buildings?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:25492:41"/>
               <hi>Caligula</hi> the Emperour made a bridge over an Arm of the Sea, three miles long.</p>
            <p>There were Temples in Rome foure hundred twenty foure, most of them very magnificent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Domitian</hi> spent upon the sole gilding of the Capitol seven Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.</p>
            <p>On the staires of the <hi>Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi> which were made all of stone, there might sit very conveniently fourescore and seven thousand spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatours; above, there might stand round about twelve thousand; in all fourescore and nineteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</p>
            <p>Beside many others, there were twelve publike Baths made by the Emperours, where men might bathe <hi>gratis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the hot Baths of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>toninus</hi> there were of polished stone one thousand and six hundred seats, &amp; there might so many men bathe themselves very conveniently.</p>
            <p>In the Bath of <hi>Hetruscus,</hi> as <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> saith, all was of silver, The passages for the water, the lips of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:25492:42"/>
the Bath, and the very floore it self. But I passe to other things.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> there were almost as many statues as men, of no worse matter then silver and gold, beside infinite others of Brasse, Marble, and Ivorse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Domitian</hi> had one of Gold in the Capitol, of an hundred pound weight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Commodus</hi> and <hi>Claudius</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so statues of Gold, each of them being of a thousand pound weight. <hi>Claudius</hi> had also in the place at <hi>Rome</hi> called <hi>Rostra</hi> another of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Hereupon there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Officer appointed, who was called the Count of Rome, on whom there attended a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny souldiers continually, to guard and look to the great number of statues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The way</hi> which is called <hi>Appia</hi> will exercise a nimble footman five dayes in running it over. It reacheth in length from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Capua;</hi> So broad, that two coaches may meet, and never trouble one another; so solid and firm, as if
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:25492:42"/>
it were all of one stone, in no place loose or broken up. There were also more wayes like unto this. It is incredible what good Authours do write of their Conduits and Aqueducts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed about one, seven Millions of Gold, and an half, and there were maintained six hundred men with the onely keeping and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the waters. These were great works indeed, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours thereof in part deserved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension for their immoderate profusenesse. There was at <hi>Rome</hi> one thing that surpassed their stately buildings, but as for name, to say no worse, and to spare your eares, dishonourable and not fit to be named. They had certain vaults under earth built with arches, you may call them the sinks of the City (they called them <hi>Cloacas</hi>) run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with water to carry away all the filth out of the City. Of these there were so many, so large, and so long, that you may well reckon them amongst the wonders of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:25492:43"/>
world. I need not instance in any more: these which I have named are sufficient. He that is any thing conversant in Histories, or hath heard of the great power &amp; wealth of the <hi>Romanes</hi> in former ages, will easily beleeve my relation: if he will not beleeve me, let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the testimony of <hi>Suctonius, Dion Cassius, Plinie, Livie,</hi> and others that have wrote of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> monuments.</p>
            <p>These things which I have rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up are very laudable in themselves. But they governed their common-wealth so prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in warre for the most part they were inconquerable, for Arts and Sciences excellent, for vertue illustrious; in so much that <hi>Cyneas</hi> an Ambassadour sent from <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> a very eloquent and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent man, when he had all in vain solicited the City to make a league with his Lord and Master, which league could not stand with the honour of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> upon his return told the king, That he thought the <hi>City</hi> to be a <hi>Temple;</hi>

and all the <hi>Senatours, Kings</hi> - Herein the <hi>Romanes</hi> were highly to be commended. But in this they were much overseen, (though otherwise very prudent men) in placing their <hi>Eternity</hi> in such things, as neither could give unto them, nor had in themselves <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi> If the <hi>Romanes</hi> had made choice of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> for their guide in the way to <hi>Eternitie,</hi> he would have shewed them a more certain and readier way.

            <p>These Rules or Lawes hath Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> fixed upon the double gates of the world, for a Glasse sit for Princes to look into. But, O ye <hi>Romanes,</hi> how farre have ye gone astray from the way that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the Gates whereon these lawes are fixed! Not to speak of other things, You have in stead of one &amp; the onely true God brought in innumerable others, to worship
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:25492:45"/>
them which are no Gods. For <hi>Rome</hi> seemed to make it a great matter of Religion, To refuse no falsitie; and when she ruled almost over all nations, To serve and follow the errours of all nations.</p>
            <p>But to let these things passe also. How vain and ridiculous a thing is it for them, to leave behinde them all their <hi>Eternitie</hi> in Parchments and Papers, in Marble and other stone, in Theatres, and Pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, in Monuments and Tombes! What is now become of their <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> which was sometime carved in stone?

How great was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in <hi>Chaldea</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and after him <hi>Belshazzar?</hi> From them the Sceptre was translated unto the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> to <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius.</hi> Neither continued it there long.

kingdome be <hi>Eternall,</hi> though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, though every way blessed, though it be promised to us, Not a word of that. For what man is there of a thousand that spends the least part of a day in meditating upon that? that ever once makes mention of that? that ever instructs his wife, his children, and his servants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that? We prattle much of all other things; but as for heaven, there is scarce any mention made of that, or if there be, surely it is very rare. In setting forth the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his own Countrey, every man is a nimble-tongued Oratour: But as for that which is our true Countrey indeed, we blush and are almost ashamed, being too modest in commending that. For it is come to passe in these dayes by the disuse of holy conference, that men think themselves not witty or facete enough, unlesse they speak idle and unprofitable words, and make foolish jests: nay that is not all, unlesse their cheeks swell, and their lips run over with filthy and unsavourie speeches. Oh! this is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:25492:48"/>
to go astray quite out of the way. But let our hearts and mouthes be filled with the praise and desire of things <hi>Eternall;</hi> let our thoughts and words alwayes run after them: we have no other way to true glory, but this; and there is no true glory, but that which is <hi>Eternall.</hi>

Such is the vanity, and affected mockerie of our foolish cogitations. What are we? And what is all that we call ours? <hi>To day</hi> we flourish like a flower, we are well spoken of, we please, and are in favour with men: But (alas!) <hi>To morrow</hi> our flower will fade, we shall be ill spoken of, and out of favour with God and man: man, whom hitherto we pleased; and God, whom we never studied for to please. We neglect heaven, and keep not earth: We get not the favour of God, and lose the worlds favour. And so we are most deplorately miserable, and destitute on both sides. If death would but spare those that are the happy ones of this world, it may be they might finde here
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:25492:49"/>
some glory; some I say, such as it is; For there is none true but that which is in heaven, and <hi>Eternall.</hi> But (alas!) Death spares no man; sees in the dark, and is not seen; and watches his time when he may set upon us, when we think not of him.

What gains he by his implacable impatience? What doth it profit him to rage and fret with indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation, to make outcries and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, to shew his will to do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, though he cannot effect what he would; or, to conclude, to salute no man civilly, as if he were an enemie to all humanitie and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie? What shall we say of such
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:25492:54"/>
a man? If there be any such, he is sure to suffer losse of goods or good name, or both: for, the riches which he hath, he possesseth not, but keeps them like a dog, whose propertie is to bark at a man, to flie upon him, and to bite him: As for his good name, if he have any, he shall not augment it by the title of impatience: and as for heaven, he loseth that before he hath taken possession of it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Teares.</hi> For, by weeping and mourning we redeem the time past, we recover what we prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally spent by sinning. But this mourning and sorrow must not last for an houre onely, or for a day: for this is nothing else, but to do as he did, who at his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death put on mourning clothes, forced for the present a few teares, and so went along af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beare, and left her not till he saw her buried; but the same day, or the next day after wiped away all teares from his eyes, changed his weeping into laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cast off his mourning clothes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:25492:54"/>
and put on colours. This is not to mourn in good earnest, to make an end of mourning so suddenly. But this we do (alas!) too often. To day we make publike confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our sinnes to God, and heare absolution; we repent us of our sinnes, and receive the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: and within a day after we sinne again with delight, and without fear, and oftentimes more grievously then before. We detest for the present the wicked course of our life past; and we return again to the same passe. We for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear the sinnes which we former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed; and again the same day we commit the same.

After a while we begin to hate even pietie it self, and the stream being turned, we turn again to our former riot and intemperance: and we are as ready to dissolve the knot of friendship made betwixt God and us, as at the first we were unwilling to have it knit. At length <hi>Pietie</hi> attended with <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> presents her self again unto us, and puts to flight lasciviousnesse, untill the time comes that we begin to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>

us of our <hi>repentance.</hi> So we seldome continue long in any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and godly course, for it seems unto us too laborious: and at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light beck we row down the stream of our former uncleannesse. Such is the inconstancie of our life, that it presents unto our mindes all sorts of pleasures and vices. We make an outward shew of adoring vertue: but in heart and minde we fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship vice, a most laborious kinde of service: This is not the way unto <hi>Eternitie,</hi> unlesse it be of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and torments which shall have no end.</p>
               <p>Let us single out one Christian man of many, and such a one es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as is most addicted to his pleasure; let us carrie him along with us to the mouth of a furnace red hot and flaming; and then let us begin to question him after this manner; How much pleasure wouldst thou ask, to continue burning in this furnace for one day? He will answer to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, I would not be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:25492:56"/>
in these flames for one day, to gain the whole world, and all the pleasures in the world. But let us propound another condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, What reward wouldst thou ask, to endure this fire onely for half a day? Propound what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you will, there is nothing so delicate, so precious, so deare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, which I would be willing to buy at so deare a price, as these torments. But to trie once more, What reward and pleasure wouldst thou ask, to go into this furnace, and to stay there but one houre? His answer certainly will be this, Let the most covetous and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man in the world ask what he can, that is not to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the unutterable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable scorchings and torments of this fire, though they should last but for one houre. If these answers be good and agreeable to right reason, How comes it to passe, O God, that for a little gain, and that but vile, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull honour, and that fugitive, for filthy pleasure, and that not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:25492:56"/>
long, so many men so little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>Eternall</hi> punishment in Hell fire? We cannot be perswaded with any reward, no though it be to gain a whole world, to stay but for one houre in fire <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:</hi> And yet, if either gain at any time invites us, or if honour smiles upon us, or pleasure allures us, we never fear Hell and fire <hi>Eternall.</hi> But thou wilt say, I hope for better; God is mercifull, and his goodnesse will not suffer me to despair, or to be terrified with the fear of evil to come. So indeed we are wont to speak: And the words in themselves are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, if our works were pious. But for the most part our works are such, that if we rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them, we have little cause to hope for mercy. It is a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and foolish part for a man to live in a constant course of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse, and to hope for <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> amongst the blessed.

               <p>LEt every Christian man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often ask himself, and others also, which are in the place of God, this question, What shall I do that I may obtain blessed <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie,</hi> or <hi>Eternall</hi> blessednesse?

               </p>
               <p>True Repentance, saith he, ought not to be in word onely, but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:25492:62"/>
in deed; and this is true Repentance indeed, if thou settest before thine eyes, from what glory thou art fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; and considerest with thy self, out of what book thy name is blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and beleevest, that now thou art neare unto utter darknesse, where there is weeping and gnash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth without end. And when thou art certainly perswaded that those things are true, as indeed they are, seeing that the soul that sinneth is in danger of Hell fire, and there is no means after Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme left to escape, but onely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; Be content to suffer any labour, and to undergo any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be freed from <hi>Eternall</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. The diseases of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy move the sick man to purge his body: Let the diseases of our souls move us also to take the purgation of Repentance: let the desire of our salvation move us: let the fear of <hi>Eternall</hi> death and <hi>Eternall</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment move us: let the hope of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Eternall</hi> life and <hi>Eternall</hi> glory move us: Let us embrace that which purgeth the soul, and let us

eschew that which polluteth it. And nothing defiles the soul more then a filthy body. Faithfull is this counsell of Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and worthy of us to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</p>
               <p>O Christ Jesus, Grant unto us that we may so possesse things transitorie and <hi>temporall,</hi> that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally we lose not the things which are <hi>Eternall:</hi> and give us grace to walk in their steps, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their good example, of whom S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh; Many there<note place="margin">August</note> are, saith he, that willingly come under the yoke, and of proud and haughty men become humble and lowly, desiring to be what before they despised, and hating to be what before they were; passing by, like strangers, things present, and making haste with greedinesse after things to come.

I live amongst men; I see and heare much evil; I have no time or leisure once to have so good a thought in minde as the thought of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> When we meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in companie to make merry, amidst our sports, and amongst our cups we never conferre about such grave points: our mindes wander up and down about many things, and cannot then fix themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the consideration of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> At our feasts and merry meetings we take our cups, and please our selves in making jests: Thoughts of <hi>Eternitie</hi> are too severe, too sad and Melancholick to be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us; we banish such out of our companie.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:25492:68"/>
We know it well enough already: what need you repeat it so often, till we loath it? So by this means there is no place or time left once to think upon <hi>Eternitie.</hi> O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian brother, it is true indeed which thou sayest, I cannot deny it. But I could wish thou wouldest be as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and forward to amend thy fault as to confesse it.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That Eternitie transcends all numbers of Arithmetick.</head>
               <p>THere is a very common and well known Arithmetick, which children are taught when they first go to School; and this is it. Suppose there were a mountain of very fine sand as big as the whole earth, or rather much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:25492:70"/>
Then suppose that every yeare an Angell should take from this mountain one, and but one grain of sand: How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, and thousand, and again I say thousand; yea how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand; and yet more, how many thousand millions of yeares must there needs passe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be perceived that the mountain is grown lesse, or any whit diminished! Let a man that is skilfull in Arithmetick sit down, and begin to cast, How many yeares must passe before the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or half the mountain be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the Angell. Certainly we cannot conceive that ever he shall be able to cast up the Totall number of the sand. But herein are we mistaken; for although we cannot conceive it possible to be done, yet it may be done. But <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie</hi> exceeds this number of yeares beyond all comparison; it is most certain: For <hi>between a thing finite and a thing infinite there is no comparison, no proportion: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie</hi> hath no limits, no terms,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:25492:71"/>
no bounds, none at all. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the damned should burn in Hell no longer, then till the mountain by grain after grain, yeare after yeare, should by the Angell be quite removed: yet what an incomprehensible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of yeares must first passe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can expect to see the day of deliverance! But (alas!) there is no such day to be expected; their torments shall have no end: After that incomprehensible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of yeares, it shall be truely said, Now beginneth their <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> their <hi>Eternitie</hi> is not in any part expired, they are as farre from the end of their torments as they were at the beginning. After a thousand yeares, yea after a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand yeares there shall not be an end or middle, or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Eternitie:</hi> For the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>Eternitie</hi> is <hi>Alwayes.</hi> The same Art of Arithmetick about the businesse of <hi>Eternitie,</hi> a late Divine teacheth, in words some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what different, but in meaning all one with the former.

Imagine a thousand millions of yeares. And yet that is nothing. <hi>Eternitie</hi> is not a whit shortened.

Imagine, I say, the damned should burn in Hell so many yeares, and yet thou hast not found the very beginning of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Imagine once more so many millions of millions of yeares as there are drops in the sea, and yet thou art not come to the beginning of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:25492:72"/>
                  <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Such for continuance is the <hi>Eternitie</hi> of joy, into which the blessed shall enter, and the <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> of torments which the damned shall suffer. O Jesus spare us, spare us O Jesus, O Jesus save us; Have mercy upon us, O good Jesus, and suffer us not to be plunged head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the bottomlesse pit, to be tormented with the damned for all <hi>Eternitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet if God would but say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the damned, Let the earth be covered with most fine sand, and let the world be filled therewith, and let it be heaped up so high as heaven, and then let an Angell come once in every thousand yeares, and take one grain of sand out of this heap; When after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand yeares as there be grains of sand, the Angell shall have removed the whole heap, then will I deliver you out of Hell: Oh how would the damned exult and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and not think themselves damned! But (alas) after so many thousands of yeares, there remain yet more, and more, and infinite
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:25492:72"/>
more, to all <hi>Eternitie,</hi> even for ever and ever. This is that heavy weight that so presseth the damned. Let every one therefore that sinneth consider with himself, and again, I say, let him consider, that unlesse he repent, he shall be pressed and grone under this heavy weight of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guilielmus Peraldus</hi> Bishop of Lions, a very religious and learned man, hath another manner of rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, meditating upon the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable number of yeares, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the damned shall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. If the damned, saith he, should every day distill from their eyes but one small teare, and those teares should be added together day after day, they would at length farre exceed the drops of the Ocean: for they have their number and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and it is easie with God to say, So many are the drops of the Ocean and no more. But the teares of the damned exceed all number and measure. Alas! Alas! How little do we think upon these things! How freely and wilfully do we sinne, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:25492:73"/>
make our selves guiltie of <hi>Eternall</hi> punishment, and that oftentimes for a very little short and filthy pleasure!</p>
               <p>Yet there remains one way more of casting up this numberlesse number of yeares: Suppose there were a schedule of Parchment a span broad, but so long that it would begirt and incircle the whole Globe of the earth: And suppose it were written all over very close with figures of 9. from one end to another: Who so skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an Arithmetician, that can tell the number thereof? What moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain so great, that consisteth of so many grains of dust or sand? What Ocean so vast, that containeth within it so many drops of water? And yet this is nothing to <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi> it stretcheth it self further then so; it knows no bounds; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond all measure. But how farre is it extended? It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended infinitely and without end. If thy heart (O Christian man) be not turned into a stone, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but melt at the consideration of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:25492:73"/>
these things, and the very thought of the bottomlesse pit and <hi>Eternall</hi> punishment will make thee fear and tremble. If there be any sense in thee, here it will thew it self. But, as I said before, too few think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these things; and too many live so secure of their salvation, as if there were no Heaven, no God, no Hell, no <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Every day they heap sinne upon sinne, as if they laboured and studied to make their last day to exceed the former, for the measure and number of their sinnes: And so they passe unto <hi>Eternitie</hi> sporting and playing, as if they went to prison but for a few weeks or dayes. Such men as these, saith Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> when they should be mourning for their sinnes, they are dancing for their pleasure; and when they should be seriously meditating upon death, they runne laughing unto executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is blindnesse indeed, this is oblivious madnesse. For this short life, which is but the shadow of <hi>Eternitie,</hi> we labour beyond all measure; but for the life which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:25492:74"/>
is <hi>Eternall</hi> and most happy, we scarce take any pains at all: And yet the not obtaining of this life is the incurring of <hi>Eternall</hi> death, which as it is a torment more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous then all the torments of this life, so in this it is most grievous, that there is no rest or mitigation of pain, no not for one short houre in the infinite space of all <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi>

They that attend onely to the sound of this Trumpet, they that have eares to heare nothing but this NOW, they live for the most part so, as if there were no AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WAYES for to follow. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not remove the camp; amidst their pleasures they wilfully forget that they are here but Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and strangers: whithersoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the wanton flesh inviteth them, they go with greedinesse: they are busied altogether in heaping up riches and following pleasures; And the sound of this NOW doth so obtund and dull their eares, that they are deaf to all good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and precepts; and they will not so much as lend an eare to that ALWAYES which shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. But they which open their eares to heare, and their hearts to understand, when the Church

soundeth both Trumpets (as it often doth) and thereupon seriously consider with themselves, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare together this short NOW with that infinite and everlasting ALWAYES, they will use no delay, but presently remove the camp: they live here as Pilgrims and strangers; they have their loyns girt; they remember that they are in a journey; they send their riches and pleasures before them into their Countrey which is above; they choose rather to enjoy them ALWAYES in heaven, then NOW for a short time upon earth. Certain it is, whosoever heareth attentively, and mindeth seriously the Alarm of these Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and thereupon compareth together things present with things future, and things transitorie with things <hi>Eternall,</hi> He will presently make himself ready to depart, he will prepare himself a place of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, he will lay out his winding sheet, he will send for his bear, and furnish himself with all things necessarie for his journey, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring

            <p>
               <hi>Benedictus Renanus</hi> reports of a vain and ungodly fellow, a very Epicure and meer worldling, which never used to fast or watch, one that could not endure the want of any thing, but especially sleep. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a certain night, it seems, this fellow could not sleep as he was wont, being much troubled with unusuall dreams: so he turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon his bed from one side to another, and could not by any means get any rest; then he wished it were day. But here the winde of the Lord began to blow, though it were in a strange land: for good thoughts were very rare in this man. Being weary with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and finding no ease or rest a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

all, thus he began to think with himself; Would any be hired upon any condition to lie thus two or three yeares together, in darknesse, without the companie of friends, though his sicknesse were not very grievous? Would he be content to want his sports and playes, so long? Would he be content to be bound to his bed, though it were a feather-bed, or a bed of down, and never stirre abroad to see any sights or shews, or make merry with his friends? I think no man would. And shall I alone amongst all men enjoy rest and pleasure by an especiall priviledge, and have no sense of grief and sorrow? Surely no. Will I, nill I, needs I must sometime or other lie down upon the bed of sicknesse, unlesse I be suddenly taken away by death, which God forbid. (<hi>This was a good winde, these were good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations.</hi>) But what bed shall I have next, when death shall thrust me out of this? My body must rot under earth: For this is the condition of all men after death.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:25492:81"/>
But what shall become of my soul in another world? Surely all men do not go to the same place after death. Do not some go one way, and some another? Is there not an Hell as well as an Heaven? Wo and alas! What kinde of bed shall the damned finde in Hell? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares shall they lie there? In what yeare after their first entrance shall the flames cease and be put out? Assuredly Christ doth not onely in word threaten to cast the wicked into everlasting fire, but will also cast them in indeed. This thing is certain and very manifest. Therefore the damned shall burn in Hell for ever. Therefore, a thousand, and a thousand, and again I say a thousand yeares will not suffice to purge away the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>innes of this short life. Therefore they shall never see the Sunne any more, nor Heaven, nor God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most miserable <hi>Eternally</hi> and without end. With such thoughts as these this man became so vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and watchfull, and proceeded so farre, that night and day he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:25492:81"/>
could not be at rest, but <hi>Eternitie</hi> did still runne in his minde. Fain indeed he would have shaken off the thoughts thereof, as gnawing worms; but he could not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he followed sports and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, went to merry meetings, sought out companions like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and sate oftentimes so long at his cups, that he laid his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science asleep, and so seemed to take some rest: But when he came again unto himself, his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being awakened did present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuse him, and suggest unto him afresh sorrowfull thoughts of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Thus finding no rest, he resolved at length to amend his manners, and to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a better course of life. And thus he began to reason with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, Miserable man that I am, what do I here? I so enjoy the world, that indeed I enjoy it not; I suffer many things I would not; I want many things which I fain would have; I serve like a slave; but who will pay me my wages? I see well enough how the world
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:25492:82"/>
rewardeth those that love it, and do all their lives nothing else but serve it. But suppose I had the fruition of all the delights and pleasures in the world that my heart could wish: what certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ie can I have, how long they shall last? I am not certain whether I shall live till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or no: Daily Funerals suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prove this. Oh <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> if thou wert not! Oh <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> If thy place be not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, though it be on a soft down-bed, thou canst not but be bitter and unpleasant. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is a hard matter to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our selves away from those things, whereunto we are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed, whether it be feasting, or drinking, or company-keeping, or such like: But whilest we delay and deferre the time, death may prevent us, and take us away from all these. Why then dost thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay? Why dost thou not impose an honest and happy necessitie upon thy self? Why dost thou not resolve thus presently with
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:25492:82"/>
thy self? Well, I will be another man then I have been, if it please God I live. This life lasts not long; but <hi>Eternitie</hi> endureth for ever. I must walk now in a new way; I am resolved upon it; And <hi>Now</hi> I begin, Where art thou bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Eternitie?</hi> I am seeking for thee, I am travelling towards thee.</p>
            <p>To conclude, he did as he said, he took his leave of the world, he changed the course of his life, and so lived and died an honest and godly man.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Eternitie,</hi> How few are they that think thus seriously upon thee! But certainly there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few, scarce any, that weigh and consider well with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, what thou art, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and persist in that considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We seek earnestly after all other things: onely <hi>Eternitie</hi> seemeth vile unto us, and not worth the looking after. Our thoughts runne after riches; and yet the possession of them is very uncertain; we know not how soon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:25492:83"/>
they shall forsake us, or we them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We are ambitious after honours: and yet they are slippery, and soon slide away from us. We are in love with pleasures: and yet they have sorrow and bitternesse in their latter end. We desire rest: but it is of no long continuance. We knit the knot of friendship with others: but it is such as death shall quickly dissolve. We are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well but when we are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with others: but our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation is never in heaven, where it should be. We seek for abundance: but it is there, where it will soon fail. But surely, if we did more often and seriously think upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie,</hi> we should not have such a fervent desire after things of so short continuance. I call Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> to witnesse, who saith<note place="margin">Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</note> thus, <hi>He that longeth after things Eternall, cannot but loath things transitorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are that have often in their mouthes I know not what <hi>Eternitie,</hi> that will promise and sweare and make good resolutions
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:25492:83"/>
of amendment, and say thus; As long as I live, I will beware of such a place, or such a place, where I have formerly been tempted to sinne: I will never come neare such a man, or such a woman, or such a one that was my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in evil, I will never come neare him as long as I live. As long as I live, I will never go to such and such meetings, where there useth to be gluttonie and drunkennesse, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, chambering and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and such like. It shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice me that I have been there once, and again, and perhaps oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; that I have done as the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did, that I have sinned with such and such. These are good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions: In this I commend thee, O man; Because sinne is to be feared, thou dost well in purposing to avoid the occasion of sinning: and I could wish thou wert as reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in observing what thou hast promised, as thou art ready to promise. But (alas!) after a day or two, yea an houre or two, too forgetfull of thy promise and good
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:25492:84"/>
resolution, thou dost again the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same thing which lately thou didst detest, abhorre and forsweare. Therefore before thou makest a vow or promise unto God, it is good to use due consideration and foresight; and when thou hast made a vow or promise unto God, it is necessarie to use after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care and Christian fortitude in performance. Thou must promise nothing rashly and unadvisedly unto God: But what thou hast promised thou must religiously and constantly keep and observe. How severe God is in punishing such as break their vowes and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, we are sufficiently taught by the wofull experience and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example of others.</p>

All the time of our life is consumed and wasted away with vain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, many sorrows, sundry fears, often suspicions, and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble troubles: Even as the Spider spends her self in the weaving of her web. Our labours are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall, linked one unto another; our sighs and groans continuall, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the pursuing of our profits and pleasures, and partly in the removing and eschewing those things which we count evil.

And when she hath done all this, spun her fine threeds, weaved them one within another, wrought her self a fine Conopie, hanged it aloft, and thinks all is sure; on a sudden in the twinkling of an eye, with a light sweep of a beesome all falls to the ground, and so her labour perisheth.

                  <note place="margin">30.</note> This was a very good question; A better and a more profitable could not be moved. But, O good God, where is this question now in the world? The world is full of other questions: but this is scarce any where to be heard. Most men do now adayes betray themselves by their own questions, and bring to light, and so make others witnesses of their simplicitie, or curiositie, or some such hidden disease of minde. He which makes diligent search and enquirie where the best wine is to be sold, doth sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what he loves best, and where his chiefest care is. Another asketh
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:25492:88"/>
such questions as a modest man would blush to heare: And this man shews that his heart is full, and that out of the abundance thereof his mouth speaketh. All mens mouthes in all places are full of questions such as these are: But it is a rare thing to heare one man ask another this question, Do you think this is the way to heaven? It is a fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to every vicious man, but more proper to the libidinous and lustfull, the luxurious and riotous man, though he be plunged into the deep, and begins to sink and to be overwhelmed, yet seldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to enter into a serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with himself, and with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere minde ask himself this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Shall I ever think to obtain <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> felicitie by this course of life? Is this the way to heaven? But of all men those especially least think upon such questions as these, those I say, that live a soft life, fare deliciously and wallow in pleasures, that feel little or no sorrow and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, or if they do at any time feel never so little, labour what they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:25492:88"/>
can to be senselesse of it. To suffer, they count the greatest of all evils. If it goes well with them, they care not how it fares with others. If it be well with them for the present, they take no care what shall follow after. They never once think upon <hi>Eternitie.</hi> This is their dayly ditty, <hi>The heaven of heavens is the Lords, but the earth he hath given to the sonnes of men.</hi> They want neither strength of body or minde, by which to escape the hands of men: But God hath long hands, he shall surely finde them out; they must appeare before him who is the judge of all the world; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not escape his judgement; they shall surely suffer <hi>Eternall</hi> punishments for their wickednesse and their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. But if God in his secret judgement casts away any man as a reprobate, and suffereth him to live after his own lust and pleasure, He giveth him his portion of prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and felicitie in this life, he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him here that he may punish him hereafter. And if at any time he doth any thing that is good, he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:25492:89"/>
presently receiveth his reward. Of such unhappy-happy men the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 5.</note> Prophet saith thus, <hi>They are not in trouble as other men: neither are they plagued like other men.</hi> They go <hi>a whoring with their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</hi>

               <p>IN the yeare of our Lord one thousand one hundred eighty
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:25492:89"/>
five, <hi>Andronicus</hi> Emperour of the East being overcome and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner by <hi>Isaac Angelo,</hi> had two hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy iron-chains put about his neck, was laden with fetters and shackles, and was most barbarously and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully used, and at length in this manner was brought before the forenamed <hi>Isaac.</hi> Before whom complaining of his hard usage, he was delivered over to the multitude to be abused at their pleasure. They being set on fire with anger, thought it a fine thing to be revenged of their enemy: And thus they used him. They buffetted him, they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinadoed him, they pulled him by the beard, they twitcht his hair from his head, they dasht out his teeth, they dragged him in publick, they made him a laughing-stock, they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered women to beat him with their fists. Then they cut off his right hand, and being thus maimed they thrust him into the dungeon of theeves and robbers, without either meat or drink or any other thing that was necessarie, or any one to look after him. After a few dayes
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:25492:90"/>
they put out one of his eyes, and being thus shamefully mangled, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one eye put out, and one hand cut off, they put upon him a very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short coat, shaved his head, set him upon a scabbed Camel with his face toward the tail, put upon his head a Crown of Garlick, made him hold in his hand the Camels tail in stead of a Sceptre, and so they carried him through the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place very leisurely with great pomp and triumph. And here the most impudent, base, &amp; vile amongst the people like savages after an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane sort fell upon him, nothing at all considering that not past three dayes before he was no lesse then an Emperour, crowned with a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Diadem, commended, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, honoured, yea and adored of all men. Nothing at all regarding their oath of Allegiance, They raged and were mad upon him, and their rage and madnesse fitted every man with instruments of mischief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. Some struck him on the head with clubs, others filled his nostrils with dirt, others squeezed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:25492:90"/>
sponges upon his face first soaked in the excrements of man and beast, others runne him into the sides with spits. Some threw stones, others threw dirt at him: some cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him mad dog, others called him fool and blockhead. An impudent woman running out of a kitchin with a kettle of scalding water in her hand, poured it upon his head as he passed by: There was none which did not some mischief or other to him. At length they brought him to the Theatre to make him a laughing-stock, took him down from the Camel, and hanged him up by the heels between two pillars. Thus poore Emperour having suffered a thousand indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet bore them patiently, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself like a man, and a true Christian Champion. He was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard all the while to lament, or cry out of his hard fortune: For it had been to no purpose. He was all the while casting up his account, which he was to make unto God, and begging pardon for his sinnes. He was heard to say nothing but
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:25492:91"/>
onely this, and this he said often, <hi>Domine miserere, Domine miserere,</hi> Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy.</p>
               <p>Unhappy <hi>Andronicus</hi> which was compelled to suffer such things! But happy in this that thou didst suffer them so patiently, as being the just reward of sinne!</p>
               <p>When he was hanged up, one would have thought their malice should have ceased: but they spared him not then, as long as he lived: For they rent his coat from his body, and tossed him up and down with their hands, tearing him in pieces with their nails. One more cruell then the rest run his sword through his belly and guts as he was hanging. Two others, to trie whose sword was sharpest, thrust him through the back, leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their swords with both their hands. Here the most miserable unhappy Emperour with much ado lifted up his maimed hand to his mouth, to suck out the bloud, as some thought, from the fresh and bleeding wound, and so ended his life miserably. After some few
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:25492:91"/>
dayes he was taken down from the gibbet, and thrown under one of the arches of the Theatre like a beast, till some that had more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie in them then the rest, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved him; But yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was not suffered to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. 1.</hi> The Answers of the holy Fathers and the Church about this.</head>
               <p>OF all the holy Fathers which have lived in divers ages, we should do well to hearken unto five especially, <hi>Augustine, Chrysostome, Gregory, Bernard, Laurentius Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinianus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first question here (which yet may seem a vain and a foolish one) is, Which is easier, and more tolerable, to suffer pain in the head, eyes, or teeth; to be troubled with the stone; to be pained with the winde Colick, or <hi>Iliaca Passio,</hi> or any other acute disease; neither to sleep night nor day, but to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented continually without any respite for three dayes together.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:25492:94"/>
The question now is, I say, Which is easier, whether to suffer the pains now mentioned, or else to eat a piece of a fish, which is made bitter by the breaking of the Gall. This may seem a very ridiculous and most idle question. For, How much sweeter is it to eat such a whole fish, rather then suffer those so grievous torments though but for one day! The bitternesse of the fish will not endanger a mans life, nor make him sick, but leave onely a bitter taste in the mouth, which is unpleasing to it. It is truly answered. And yet how many thousands of men make choice ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the former! For, How often doth the Preacher teach and exhort, cry out and speak plainly! Christian brethren, consider well with your selves and look about you, The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> salvation of your souls is in question: If you walk this way, you must assuredly look for <hi>Eternall</hi> torments: Christ hath shewed you another way both by his life and doctrine. Return therefore and repent, you have gone long enough
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:25492:95"/>
astray: You may if you will have entrance into heaven; if you be shut out, it is your own fault: God is not wanting to those that are willing. It is true indeed, There is some bitternesse in using absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and fasting, in confessing of sinnes, in keeping the body under, in setting a strict watch over thy senses, in conquering ones self, in living chastly and continently. This is no easie task: But let it be what it will, we must suffer it. <hi>Ought not Christ to have</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 24. 26</note> 
                  <hi>suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory?</hi> Let not a little and short labour terrifie us: it is but for a few yeares, or it may be but a few dayes, that we are to do and suffer valiantly: But our joy and rest shall be <hi>Eternall.</hi> He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh all, whosoever overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and conquereth himself, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth himself, and resisteth his evil and violent passions; and all this for Christ, for heaven, for blessed <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Christ after his resurrection found his Disciples eating fish broyled upon the coals:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:25492:95"/>
To teach them how great things they should afterwards suffer; and that they were not to think of a soft and easie life, but that they were to be stoned, whipped, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, have their skin pulled over their eares; that this was the way to a joyfull resurrection, and to the participation and fellowship of <hi>Eternitie</hi> with the blessed: that all other things were small and of no worth in comparison of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, and that blessednesse, which yet eye hath never seen. These things are often spoken of, but they are little regarded. This fish bitter with the overflowing of the gall, that is, worldly crosses and the sufferings of this life, is often set before us: but it goes against our stomack, we cannot endure to taste of it. <hi>Eternitie</hi> is a thing we often heare of, we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reade of, it is continually prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto us, and often repeated: but we either heare not, or beleeve not, or regard not; or if we do for a time, the cares of the world soon put it out of our mindes, and we
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:25492:96"/>
burie it in oblivion. But again, the Conscience often playes the preacher, and recalls to our minde these wholesome lessons, is instant, dehorts, reproves; but prevails nothing. All is in vain. For many are so obstinate and perverse, that neither the Preacher nor their own Conscience can work upon them. But some are so impudent, that they will set themselves in opposition, and reply thus, <hi>Let it go well with us here, and we care not; we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know nor care what shall come hereafter, we are all for present profits and pleasures: no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth again from the dead; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it ever known that any one came back again out of Hell: Come therefore, let us eat, drink and be merry, let us enjoy our goods and take our pleasure.</hi> These are the worldlings Ditties: But let S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> determine this question; <hi>Melius est, modica amaritudo in</hi>

And yet saith the Father, As a dream is to an hundred yeares, so is this present life to the life to come, yea rather it is much lesse: And as a drop is to the main Ocean, so are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares unto <hi>Eternitie.</hi> And in another place, What is there,<note place="margin">Hom. 28. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Hebr.</note> saith he, to be compared unto <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie?</hi> What are a thousand yeares in comparison of infinite

Look for no end of torments after this life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thou repentest before thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partest out of this life: for after death there is no place of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, no shedding of teares will profit thee, or do thee any good: Though a man in Hell should gnash his teeth, and blare out his scorched tongue, he shall not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain so much as a drop of cold water. Grant then that a man should enjoy pleasures all his life long, what is that to infinite ages which are yet for to come? Here in this life all things good and bad have at length an end; but the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments that shall be suffered hereafter shall have no end. Set fire on the body here, and the soul will soon depart: But after the resurrection, when the body shall be from thenceforth immortall and incorruptible, the soul of the damned shall alwayes burn, and not consume in Hell-fire. They
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:25492:97"/>
shall rise again, incorruptible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: But how? Not to receive a crown of incorruptible glory, but to suffer <hi>Eternall</hi> torments. But let us heare what another of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers saith.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> makes answer to<note place="margin">Greg.</note> this common question, Will not drunkennesse sooner steal upon a man in the wine-cellar, standing by the hogshead, then in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour sitting at the table? The Spouse of Christ triumpheth in the words of <hi>Solomon, He brought</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>me to the banquetting-house</hi> (or, as some reade it, <hi>He brought me into his wine-cellar</hi>) <hi>and his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner over me was love,</hi> or, <hi>He hath set his banner of love over me.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which words Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> discoursing, saith thus, By the <hi>wine-cellar</hi> what can we better or more fitly conceive, then the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret contemplation of <hi>Eternitie?</hi> For truely whosoever doth seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider with himself upon <hi>Eternitie,</hi> and let this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sink deep into his minde, he may truely rejoyce, and triumph
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:25492:98"/>
with the Spouse, saying, <hi>He hath set his banners of love over me:</hi> For he will keep better order in his love, loving himself lesse, God more, and even his enemies also for Gods sake. But such is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this profound considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it will presently make a man drunk. Make him drunk? How? With the drunkennesse of the best desires, such as will leade him to amendment of life, carrie him to his heavenly countrey, and bring him at length to joyes <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi> It was cast in the Apostles teeth, that they were drunk with wine: And so they were indeed; but it was with wine out of this <hi>Cellar.</hi> Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath many excellent considerations, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon <hi>Eternitie:</hi> amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he hath this, which is a very short one and a true one, <hi>Momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneum quod delectat, AEternum quod cruciat: That which delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is momentanie, but that which tormenteth is Eternall.</hi> Here I could wish with <hi>Job, Oh that these</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job. 9. 23, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>words were written! Oh that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:25492:98"/>
they were printed in a Book! That they were graven with a pen of iron!</hi> These words, I say, <hi>That which delighteth is momentanie, but that which tormenteth is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi> The <hi>Book</hi> in which this should be written, is the <hi>heart</hi> of man; the <hi>pen of iron</hi> with which it should be written, is serious <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;</hi> the <hi>ink</hi> with which it should be written, is the <hi>bloud</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And these words so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed and ingraven in the breast, are then especially to be called to minde, and to be often repeated, when pleasure fawneth, when lust provoketh, when luxurie inviteth, when the flesh rebelleth, and the spirit faileth, when there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of sinne offered, and danger of falling into sinne. But let us heare what another of the Fathers saith.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place comes Saint <hi>Bernard:</hi> He shall answer to the question here to be propounded. In the lives of men there is such difference, that almost now so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men so many judgements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:25492:99"/>
afflictions. There are found some so grievously and continually afflicted, that they are ready to fall down under the crosse as being too heavy for them to beare. One is oppressed with povertie, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is afflicted with sicknesse, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other is overcharged with secret debts, another is tormented with cares, another is grieved and vexed with injuries and slanders: every man thinks that most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous which in present he suffers. And many times it comes to passe that such as are faint-hearted and impatient, wish for death, runne into the water, and make haste to the halter, thinking thereby to finde an end of all their griefs and sorrows, whereas indeed that supposed end becomes to them but the beginning of their sorrows, and such sorrows as never shall have end. But with the good and godly it is not so: They patiently endure all, submitting themselves in all things to Gods good will and pleasure. They neither desire to die quickly, nor yet to live long.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:25492:99"/>
Is it Gods will they shall die? They also are willing. Will he have them die quickly? They are willing to that also? Will he have them live yet longer? They are not against that: What God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that they will; What he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, neither will they. Beside these two kindes of men, there is a third, and that is the greatest part of men, that desire to live long: And there is almost no man so old but he hopes and desires to live yet another yeare. These men are never heard to say, they have lived long enough. Death makes too much haste with them, he comes to them too soon, yea and before his time. Here now the question may be moved, Who live, or who shall live longer. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in his seventeenth Sermon upon the ninetie first Psalme, upon these words, <hi>with long life will I satisfie him,</hi> breaketh forth into this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, What is so long as that which is <hi>Eternall?</hi> What is so long as that which shall have no end? Life <hi>Eternall</hi> is the good
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:25492:100"/>
end which we are all to aim at, and this end is without end. And further he addes, That is the true day indeed after which there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows no night, where there is <hi>Eternall</hi> veritie, and true <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> and therefore true and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> satietie. So then the question may be determined thus, That those onely shall live a long life truely so called, whosoever shall never die, but alwayes live in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; And again, That those shall die a lingring death (alas! too lingring a death) whosoever shall alwayes die, but never live in Hell: for they shall live onely there to be tormented alwayes. Let us heare but one more, and so conclude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laurentius Justinianus</hi> shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the last question for us. There are, saith he, many things in this world which nature hath so appropriated and assigned to some one certain place, that they are not to be found in any other place, unlesse it be in part. Of some flowers which grow in the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:25492:100"/>
world we have onely the seed: Of some living creatures there are brought over unto us one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the skinnes. Now, <hi>Eternitie</hi> is a thing so proper to another world, that it is not to be found in this; onely the seed thereof we may have even in this world: And what are the seeds of <hi>Eternitie?</hi> They are, saith <hi>Laurentius, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of a mans self, The gift of Charitie,</hi> and <hi>the taste of Christs works. To contemne others,</hi> is a tree that overspreadeth the whole world, whose wood is fewell for the fire of Hell. <hi>To contemne</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is a very small seed, scarce known in the world: Christ brought it down from heaven with him, who <hi>made himself</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>of no reputation, and took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the form of a servant, and became obedient,</hi> not to the<note place="margin">8.</note> Stable onely, or the Manger, but even to mount <hi>Calvarie, unto death, even the death of the Crosse,</hi> unto the grave, yea even unto Hell. <hi>Wherefore God also</hi>
                  <note place="margin">9.</note> 
                  <hi>hath highly exalted him.</hi> Behold!
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:25492:101"/>
this little seed is grown up and spread in breadth, and is become the highest of all trees. The same Authour speaking of <hi>Charitie,</hi> saith thus, The measure of our <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>Eternall</hi> reward, shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure of our <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi> For, <hi>To whom little is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 7. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>the same loveth little.</hi> He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth lesse <hi>grace,</hi> whosoever hath lesse <hi>Charitie:</hi> And where there is lesse <hi>grace,</hi> there also shall be lesse <hi>glory.</hi> So then it is most true, The more thou lovest God, the more thou heapest up unto thy self <hi>Eternall</hi> rewards. The whole Law is <hi>love,</hi> but it must be pure, chaste, and holy. I have done with the second, which is <hi>Charitie.</hi> I come to the third, which is <hi>The taste of Christs Works.</hi> It is a common and witty saying in the Rhetorick Schools, <hi>He is to be thought a good proficient, who can relish Tullies works:</hi> We may say as much in the School of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, <hi>He hath made a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse in Religion and vertue, who can relish Christs Works, who likes
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:25492:101"/>
the taste of Christs doctrine and example.</hi> But whosoever findeth no taste almost at all, no relish in the words and works of Christ; whosoever is not moved, affected, and delighted with those things which belong unto the minde, and Christian pietie, to heaven and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> felicitie; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie findes much sweetnesse in eating, drinking, walking, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, jesting and playing: The same man may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay with sorrow enough, too truely, <hi>How little seed of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie have I within me, O my God!</hi> Or rather, <hi>I have none at all.</hi> For when I descend into my self, I see manifestly what spirit is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, and whither my affection carries me. To spend whole nights in dancing, feasting, revelling, quaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, dicing, and carding, hearing foolish and idle tales, reading im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Books, calling for, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at amorous songs, playing the good fellow, and doing as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany doth, Oh this never offends me, this is pleasing and delightfull to me. But to heare of Christ
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:25492:102"/>
and his life, to heare of holy men that lived formerly, who were much given to watching, fasting, and prayer, or to reade of their lives, that makes no musick in my eares, and this is an eye-sore unto me: I can neither heare nor see: I stop mine eares, and close mine eyes for fear lest they should be offended. To heare a Sermon of an houre long, it is death unto me, and therefore I sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come to Church: or if I do sometimes, I drive away the time, either sleeping or prating. There are too many such men in the world: but of such it may be truely said, That they have no taste or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish at all of the works of Christ. But now let us heare the judgement of the Church concerning <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The memorie of <hi>Eternitie</hi> is so precious in the esteem of the Church, that there is no Psalme, no Prayer, no Hymne but closeth with it, <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to the Sonne, and to the Holy Ghost; as it was in the beginning,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:25492:102"/>
is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. As it was in the beginning,</hi> that is, Before all beginning, from all <hi>Eternitie,</hi> without any beginning: <hi>is now, and ever shall be, world without end,</hi> that is, Throughout all ages; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, innumerable, incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ages; to all <hi>Eternitie.</hi> But let us leave the little rivers, and make haste to the fountain.</p>

upon <hi>Eternitie!</hi> or if I have thought upon it, in what a cold and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent manner have I done it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding every day, yea every houre and minute I draw nearer and nearer unto <hi>Eternitie!</hi> But for the time to come, by the assistance of thy grace I will minde it more carefully then heretofore I have done; and if at any time through thy bounty riches shall increase, I will not set my heart upon them: though the world should smile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, though I should want no temporall thing that my heart can desire, though I should seem to flow in never so much abundance, yet will I still remember <hi>Eternitie.</hi> In the midst of my prosperitie these shall be my thoughts, But how long shall this last? will this fair weather never change? Will this comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table sunne alwayes shine upon me? Or if I should live in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie all the dayes of my life, what shall it profit me after death? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this sweet but short, pleasing but perilous, unhappy happinesse, there shall shortly follow <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:25492:105"/>
Eternitie.</hi> But if the world goes ill with me, if it frown upon me, if I meet with many crosses, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and affictions, if misfortunes befall me, if they rush upon me like waves one in the neck of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, if I be turmoiled and tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up and down, then these shall be my daily thoughts, Well, let the world have its course, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to bear it, Gods will be done. Let the sea be troubled, let the waves thereof roare, let the windes of afflictions blow, let the waters of sorrows rush upon me, let the clouds of tentations threaten rain and thunder, let the darknesse of grief and heavinesse compasse me about, yea though the foundation of the world should seem to shake, yet will I not be afraid. These storms will blow over, these windes will be laid, these waves will fall, this tempest cannot last long, and these clouds shall be dispel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

               <p>MOst true it is, Whatsoever la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or sorrow we suffer in this life, it is but a <hi>Modicum,</hi> or <hi>for a little while.</hi> It is the saying of S. <hi>Augustine, This Modicum or</hi>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:25492:106"/>
it is not yet all past and gone: But when it shall come to an end, then shall we perceive and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what a little while this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum was.</hi> The wisest of men being to shew the vanitie and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this present life, though it should be lengthened to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, which few men can reach unto, makes choice of the most minute things in the world, whereby to expresse it, and set it forth by way of resemblance. For thus we reade expresly in <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticus, The number of a mans</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ecclus 18. 9.</note>

of water to the deep and fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Sea? such are fifty, sixty, yea an hundred yeares (Heare this ye old men) they are but a <hi>Modicum,</hi> a very little while, but a <hi>Minute</hi> of time, indeed nothing at all to the dayes of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> And yet foolish and miserable men, we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with this little stone, this small drop. Our life is indeed <hi>a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle stone,</hi> but no jewell, no precious stone; it is made of no better mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then sand. Our life is <hi>a drop,</hi> but not of sweet and fresh water; it is salt and brackish as the sea-water is. <hi>For all his dayes are sorrows,</hi>

Certainly, if thou hadst lived all the time since <hi>Adam</hi> was thrust out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> even unto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:25492:107"/>
thou wouldst perceive and confesse that thy life was not long, which is so soon fled away. For what is any mans life? Adde as many yeares as thou wilt, imagine the longest old age: What is it? Is it not as a morning blast? All this is most true. I pray you tell me, where is <hi>Adam</hi> now? where is <hi>Cain?</hi> where is long-liv'd <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuselah?</hi> where is <hi>Noah?</hi> where is <hi>Sem?</hi> where is <hi>Eber?</hi> where is most obedient <hi>Abraham?</hi> where is <hi>Jacob?</hi> where is <hi>Joseph?</hi> They are dead and gone, their time is past; we may say of them, <hi>Vixerunt, fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt Troes, Once they were, now they are not.</hi> Thus our life passeth away; thus the glory of the world passeth away. O morning dew! O meere vanitie! What is it that we so desire here? what so long as to be hoped or wished for here? short it is, a <hi>Modicum</hi> it is, it is vile and nothing worth, it is but a small point whatsoever thine eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth here.

               <p>Here, Christian brother, I will deal more boldly and plainly with thee, and lay the matter so open that thou shalt see it clearely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented before thine eyes. Thou sayest that thou dost often think upon heaven, and that thou hast an earnest and longing desire after <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Sayest thou so? I heare thee, but I do not beleeve thee: neither would I have thee beleeve me if I should say so of my self. For how can it be (O good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian brother) how can it be that thou or I should think so often and so seriously upon heaven, and have such a longing desire (as we say we have) after <hi>Eternitie,</hi> and yet be so lukewarm, yea stone-cold in matters of religion; so slow and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:25492:109"/>
backward to that which is good, so prone and forward to that which is evil, so ready and willing to all manner of wantonnesse, so querulous and complaining, so slothfull and negligent? Where we should be angry, there are we too patient; and where we should be patient and couragious, there are we too faint-hearted and pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. In the fire of every light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, our patience melts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes away: nay we are often cast down with a word, we are blown down with the breath of a mans mouth. But never are we more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient and desperate, then when our wills are crossed. I might speak here of the hot <hi>Apostems</hi> of lust wherewith our hearts are often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and swoln, and likewise of the devouring <hi>Cancer</hi> of Envie which often eats into our breasts, and makes our flesh consume away: But I passe them by. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what hath been said, we good and godly men, as we professe our selves, and would have other think us to be, too timourous
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:25492:109"/>
where we should be bold, and too bold where we should be timou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, glory in nothing more then in this, That we have often in our mindes, and hearty desires, the joyes of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Beleeve it, it is not credible that the thoughts of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and <hi>Eternitie</hi> should be so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our mindes as we speak of, and yet mean while that we should live no better then we do. Did I say, It is not credible? Nay I say it is impossible. And thus I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it.</p>
               <p>The Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> served his uncle <hi>Laban</hi> for his daughter <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> seven yeares, <hi>And they seemed</hi>

                  <hi>to him but a few dayes, for the love that he had to her.</hi> Hearest thou this whosoever thou art that so complainest? Thou servest no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postour or deceiver as <hi>Laban</hi> was, but God thy maker, and him that will surely keep his covenant and promise. Thou servest not for a wife, but for the kingdome of heaven: not for the beauty and sight of a wife, but for the beatificall vision and <hi>Eternall</hi> sight of God: not for
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:25492:110"/>
the delight and pleasure of a wife, but for celestiall and <hi>Eternall</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleasures. And yet doth the trouble of one winters day of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes so cast thee down, that suddenly all thy love towards God, and thy desire after heaven begins to wax cold in thee. Assoon as the storm of adversitie begins, thou breakest forth into most bitter complaints, thou callest heaven and earth to witnesse, thou breathest nothing but revenge; yea often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I beleeve, thou sparest not God himself, but callest his justice into question. At other times when pleasure with her fawning allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hath once enticed thee, she doth so bewitch thee, and take away thy memorie, that thou quite forgettest to serve God, and so runnest headlong into the <hi>Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> of sinne, which hath a fair entrance, at least seemingly, but leadeth thee the next way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Is this the vigilancy which thou so much talkest of? Is this thy heroicall fortitude, and love of God? How wilt thou serve
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:25492:110"/>
God seven yeares, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did <hi>Laban,</hi> when (alas!) thou canst not endure the labour and sorrow of one short day? O <hi>Simon, Simon, sleepest thou? Couldest thou not</hi>

And it is very likely that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when he was weary at his work he had an eye unto <hi>Rachels</hi> beauty, and said thus with himself, Surely for her beauty she is worthy for whom I should suffer seven yeares hard service; and, if need were, I would not stick to serve yet seven yeares more. Such was the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that he bore unto <hi>Rachel,</hi> that it made him scarce sensible of any labour.</p>

Thou knowest thy wages, if thou servest God: Not <hi>Labans</hi> daughters nor flocks of sheep; God himself shall be the reward of thy service: Thou shalt be blessed both in soul and body; It shall be well with thee on every side; Thou shalt enjoy all manner of delights, great delights without either lacking or loathing, and without end. Thou shalt swimme in the bottomlesse <hi>Ocean</hi> of pleasures: And yet (behold!) thy hands are slack to every good work; Thy feet are slow to go to Church; Thy heart consumes away with envy, flames with anger and revenge, abounds with the vermine of filthy thoughts, and is quite dead through slothfulnesse and impatience. Is this thy serving of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:25492:112"/>
God? Is this the way, thinkest thou, to heaven, to immortall life, to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> blessednesse? Surely it is not. Why dost thou not rather as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> did? when thou art weary with any labour which thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goest in the service of God, when the world goes ill with thee, when adversitie presseth thee, prosperitie seduceth thee, and labours burden thee, lift up thine eyes to heaven, behold <hi>Rachel,</hi> who is promised unto thee, and thus comfort up thy self, Be not troubled, O my soul, Behold thy <hi>Rachel,</hi> thy <hi>Rachel</hi> which is in heaven, fair <hi>Rachel,</hi> comely <hi>Rachel, Rachel</hi> that is all beautifull, not having any one ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish about her! Behold heaven and the house of thy <hi>Eternall</hi> rest and pleasure! Be content to suffer for a while, a little sorrow, and some pains: For thou shalt short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be where thy <hi>Rachel</hi> is, and there thou shalt be the more joyfull and blessed, by how much the more thou art here sorrowfull and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: There shall thy rest be the more pleasant and joyfull, by how
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:25492:112"/>
much the more thy life here is heavy and painfull. Well then, be of good courage, shew Christian for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and patience. <hi>Eternitie,</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Eternitie,</hi> is more worth, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more worth then all that we can do or suffer. If thus, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian brother, thou wouldest ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and encourage thy self, if with such eyes thou wouldest oftner look up to heaven, if with such affection thou wouldest dayly think upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie:</hi> Beleeve it, All thy dayes of service here on earth, would seem but few, for the great love which thou wouldest have unto <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie:</hi> Thou wouldest count all labour easie, all troubles welcome, all losses gain. This I will say, and therewith I will conclude, The more a man thinks upon the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> of the world to come, the more care he will take here, to leade a godly life in this present world.</p>

               <p>CHrist the <hi>Eternall</hi> sonne of the <hi>Eternall</hi> God came into this world, clad with no other garment then we, that is, stark naked.

And now (alas!) how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably arayed do we come into this world! Christ together with us, yea for us suffers punishment, and yet was not guilty of any sinne.

The thorns, his pillow; And the Crosse, his bed. Which many reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men of former times well considering with themselves, have voluntarily and freely chosen to lie hard, and take little rest, that at the day of resurrection they might rise joyfully to rest <hi>Eternall.</hi> Some, as we may reade, have made the earth their Mattresse; Sackcloth, their Sheet; and a Stone, their Boulster. And many there are which do so still to this day. But I leave them and return to Christ.

That he might save us from death <hi>Eternall.</hi> Die we must all of us; but our death is but short.

By me were you destroyed before you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; by me were you damned before you were brought forth. I

fain would be as God, and by that means I am left scarce a man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you could perish, you all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in me. I my self do not know whether you may better call me a Father, or a Tyrant and a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. I cannot wonder or complain justly that you are so vicious and so sinfull: for you learnt it of me. I am sory that you are so disobedient: but this you learnt also of me. I was first disobedient unto God that made me. The Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven blush and are ashamed to see your gluttonie and intemperance: but this is your fathers fault. Your pride hath made you odious and detestable before God: but this monster first conquered and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over me, and so pride became more proud then she was before. This is the inheritance you receive from me, nothing else but an heap of miseries. God indeed of his free good-will gave unto me by a sure promise heaven for an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and intailed it upon you: But I have undone you all, cut off the intail, and prodigally made
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:25492:118"/>
away all for one bit. I valued my wife and an apple more then you all, more then heaven, more then God. A cursed and unhappy din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for which I deserved to sup in Hell many thousand yeares after. I lived in <hi>Paradise,</hi> a garden full of all delight and pleasure beyond imagination: God gave me the free use of all things therein; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fruit of one tree was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden me. I was Lord of all the creatures, I was wise and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, strong and lusty. I abounded with all manner of delights. The aire was then as temperate as could be desired; the clouds were clad in bright blew; the heaven smiled upon us; the Sunne did shine so pure that nothing could be more. All things seemed to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us at our new marriage. Our eyes could behold nothing but that which was flourishing and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to them; Our eares were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually filled with musick, the birds those nimble Choristers of the aire ever warbling out their pleasant ditties. The earth of it

self brought forth odoriferous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon and saffron. I was compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed about with pleasures on every side. I lived free and remote from all care, sorrow, fear, labour, sicknesse and death. I seemed to be a God upon earth. The Angels in heaven rejoyced to see my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse: there was none that did envy me but my self. But because I obeyed not the voice of God, all these evils fell upon me. I was driven out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> banished from the sight of God, and for shame I hid my face. Labour, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, mourning, fear, teares, cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, a thousand miseries seized upon me, and quite wearied me out; you feel it, as many as are of my familie: and that which seems to be the end of all temporall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie and sorrow, is oftentimes the beginning of <hi>Eternall.</hi> O my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren learn by your own wofull experience, learn by your own losse and mine, learn I say to be wise at length.

When we must needs depart out of this world, then we begin to think upon another world. When we can live no longer here, then we begin to think of the life to come hereafter. When the

to stay at home, and not to stirre abroad, unlesse it be to Church. This is too melancholick a life for a young man. But when they grow old, what do they then? Then are they old and sickly, weak and feeble; you must not look for these things of them at that age; their strength will not permit; it is not with them as formerly it hath been; you must give them leave to take their ease; let them have a care of their health: This is all they have to do.

No man is sufficiently armed against death, unlesse he be alwayes prepared to entertain it. What is it else but rashnesse and folly, folly and madnesse, and indeed meere contempt of <hi>Eternitie,</hi> for a man to lie down in ease upon a feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, to sleep secure snorting and snoring, and to lodge an enemy, a deadly enemy, all the while, sinne in his very bosome? Sudden deaths are very common and ordinary amongst us. How many have we

heard of, that went to bed well over night for ought any man could tell, and were found dead in the morning! I will not say carried away out of their beds, and cast into Hell-fire; whether it be so or no God knows. Have we not seen and known some that have been suddenly struck, fallen sick and died in the space of an houre? Within an houre? yea lesse then an houre, sound and sick, quick and dead. And yet do we (rash and foolish men!) procrastinate it from day to day (that is nothing) from yeare to yeare do we deferre our Repentance, and the amendment of our lives, and death mean time unexpected seiseth upon us, and delivers us up unto <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> correcting in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self such lingring and dangerous delay, such lentitude and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse of minde and will to repent, said thus, I felt and found<note place="margin">August</note> how I was held intangled, and I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A great conflict there was between them, many houres spent to little purpose: they were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off from agreement at length then before: for neither would yeeld to conditions propounded by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: well; it grew late, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted more offended and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed one with another then before, and so left the suit pendent. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetas</hi> thought it a hard case to part with his money, and the <hi>Patriarch</hi> seemed to be in the right, and to stand out in the cause of God and the poore. But yet when <hi>Nicetas</hi> was gone, the <hi>good Bishop</hi> weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the matter better with himself,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:25492:125"/>
and condemned himself for his pertinacie, and though he was in a good cause and knew it also, yet said, Can I think that God will be well pleased with this impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable wrath, and wilfull stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Great surely was the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and speedie was the operation of these few words, <hi>The sunne is going down:</hi> For presently upon the hearing thereof a peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt them, which was sought for before with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of words, but could not be effected. So do thou, whosoever thou art that knowest thy self guilty of any grievous sinne, if not before, towards the evening at least call to minde those operative words, <hi>The Sunne is going down.</hi> For what knowest thou whether thou shalt rise again with the Sunne or no? And if thou diest in the night without Repentance, it is a question in which <hi>Eternitie</hi> thou shalt have thy part, whether of the blessed, or of the cursed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do what thou hast to do quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:25492:126"/>
                  <hi>The Sunne is going down.</hi> But have a care it go not down upon thy lust or luxurie, envie or blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, detraction or theft, or upon any other grievous sinne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of. Good God! what a thing is this? If there be but a stain in a garment, a spot in the face, a blot in a cap, we present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use some means to take it out, or wash it off. Are these such eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sores to us, and yet are we so blinde within, that we cannot see our manifold corruptions and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions? or do we see and suffer them? can we suffer them and not be troubled at them? are we trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and yet seek no means to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate and purge them out? When we are polluted at any time with the stain of sinne, we should la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour presently to take it out: The sooner it is done, the better and the easier it is. Therefore saith Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> We ought to be carefull<note place="margin">Ambros</note> to repent: but that is not all; Our repentance must be also speedy, for fear lest the heavenly husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Gospell, that planted a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:25492:126"/>
figge-tree in his vineyard, come and seek for fruit, and finding none say unto the dresser of his vineyard, <hi>Cut it down.</hi> If the sentence be once past, there is no avoiding the fatall blow: Down it must. If therefore we finde our selves once wounded with sinne, let us look for help in time. The brute beasts which have no understanding will teach us so much providence. The Harts of <hi>Candie</hi> or <hi>Creet,</hi> assoon as they are struck, runne presently to their <hi>Dictamnum</hi> or <hi>Dittanie;</hi> The swallows, to cure the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their young ones eyes, flie to fetch their <hi>Chelidonium</hi> or <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine;</hi> The Dog, when he is sick, makes haste to his <hi>Grasse</hi> to give him a vomit; The Toad fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Spider, assoon as she feels her self begin to swell, crawls to her <hi>Plantain,</hi> and so is recovered. These by a naturall instinct know their own proper medicines, and upon all occasions presently make recourse unto them. But we poore miserable men, more unreasonable and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:25492:127"/>
understanding then the beasts, are wounded every day, and that many times deadly, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we seek for no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to cure our spirituall disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. We use the same diet we were wont to do, we talk as freely and merrily as ever we did, we go to bed at our accustomed houre, and sleep according to our old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe. But <hi>Repentance</hi> is the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick that goes against our sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, <hi>Contrition</hi> cuts us to the heart, <hi>Confession</hi> seems bitter in our mouthes: we choose rather to continue sick, then so be cured. This is our miserable condition: so foolish are we, and void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, either not knowing, or at least not embracing that which would make for our <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> good.</p>
               <p>If we would give eare unto the counsell of the heavenly <hi>Angels,</hi> which seem in the Picture accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their description, to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection unto us, and are indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God as ministring spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits for our good: if we would,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:25492:127"/>
I say, give eare unto their counsell, then certainly we would neither suffer our eyes to sleep nor our eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids to slumber, neither the temples of our heads to take any rest, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till our peace and reconciliation were made with God. They put us still in minde that our day is almost spent, that the night draws on, that our glasse is neare running out, that death is at hand, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death cometh judgement: But we securely walk on in our old way; Let the day spend, let the night draw on, let the glasse runne out; Come death, follow judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, We are not troubled at it, we care not, we regard not, no warning of the <hi>Angels</hi> will serve our turn.

I can, I tell thee, that I can, and finde no harm at all by it. Be not too confident: That may happen in the space of one houre, which hath not happened in a thousand. Thou art not past danger: For consider with thy self how long thou hast to live: There is no great distance betwixt thy soul and death, hell and <hi>Eternitie.</hi> It is gone in a breath. Thou mayst most truely say every houre, I am within one degree of death, within one foot, yea within one inch. Death need not spend all his quiver upon thee: One Arrow, the head of one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row shall wound thee to the heart, and make such a large orifice that bloud and spirits and life and all shall suddenly run out together. Either thou livest in a malignant and corrupt aire, or else thou art troubled with distillations falling down from thy head upon the lungs, or else there is some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction

in the veins or in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or else the vitall spirits are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated, or else the pulsation of the Arteries is intercepted, or else the Animall spirits runne back to their head, and there are either frozen to death, or else drowned: One way or other thou postest to the end of thy short race; and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou art but a dead man, carried away to <hi>Eternitie</hi> in the turning of an hand, before thou couldst ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, or think upon it. There are a thousand wayes to bring a man to his end; I do not speak of lingring deaths before which there goes some warning, but of sudden deaths that summon us, arrest us, and carry us away all in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He dies suddenly that dies unpreparedly. Death is not sudden if it be foreseen and alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. That's sudden death which was unpremeditate: and unpreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate death is the worst of all deaths: And from such sudden death good Lord deliver us. It is good counsell for every one, let him be of what age he will, for no age
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:25492:129"/>
is priviledged more then another; death hath a generall commission which extends to all places, persons, ages, there is none exempt: It is good counsell then I say for every one at all times, and in all places, and in all companies to expect death, and to think every day, yea every houre to be his last: Then let him die, when please God, he shall not die suddenly. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men have we heard of, whose light hath suddenly been put out, and life taken away either by a fall, or the halter, or poyson, or sword, or fire, or water, or Lions pawes, or Bores tusks, or Horse heels, and a thousand more wayes then these! As many senses as we have (That number is nothing) As many parts and members as we have (And yet that is nothing) As many pores as there be in all the parts of our body put together, So many windows are there for death to creep in at, to steal upon us, and suddenly cut our throats. <hi>Thou wast born</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>)<note place="margin">August</note> 
                  <hi>That is sure: For thou

            <p>The Lawyers know well enough that a man will not let go his right and title, though it be but in a matter of three halfpence, if it be a perpetuitie, and to be yearly paid for ever. Yea it is thought a great rent if a man be bound to pay though but three farthings yearely to his landlord, as long as the world endures. In such esteem are perpetuities, though in things little worth, though but three Pepper-corns. If thou art so sollicitous and eager in pursuing thy right of three halfpence; how comes it to passe, O man, that thou art so negligent and carelesse in seeking after the inheritance of an <hi>Eternall</hi> kingdome, which may be had at a few yeares purchase? Thou fallest out with thy brother for three halfpence, thou goest to law with him, thou makest it a long suit: In the mean time thou suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferest others to carry away the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. What is the reason? Is it so
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:25492:133"/>
little worth? is it not worth look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after? It seems, thou thinkest so; or else thou wouldest labour for it more then thou dost. Thou art much cumbred about other things, thou thinkest all pains little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; thou art never weary of seeking after them: But as for <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> that thou thinkest to be a great way off, and therefore thou art scarce ever at leisure so much as once to think upon it; or, if thou art any time at leisure, then thou hast no minde to it. Oh! it is a grievous thing, and very wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risome to be alwayes looking after that which yet is not here ever throughly to be lookt into. Who would trouble his head, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his minde about it? We are all for the present: Give us present possession; that is the thing we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, that is the thing we delight in; there is some content in that.</p>
            <p>See our folly and want of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! What blindnesse is this, or rather is it not madnesse, to look for certaintie where none is, and where it is, never to look for it?
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:25492:134"/>
In a businesse concerning our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and uncertain riches, we love to be certain, we will have good securitie, which yet at the best is very uncertain: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Eternall</hi> &amp; certain riches, we make our selves so certain, that we look for no assurance; we are so secure, that we look for no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, which yet, if we would, we might have as good as could be desired. Does any man lend money without a bill, or a bond, or a pledge? Every man hath this presently in his mouth, I love to be certain; I desire good securitie; I will go safely to work; I will not put the matter to hazard. Things present and certain, when we hold the balance, alwayes weigh down things future and uncertain. <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> say we, (as the proverb goes) <hi>is one bird in the hand then two in the bush.</hi> And, <hi>I had rather see a Wren in the cage, then an Eagle in the clouds.</hi> We are of <hi>Plautus</hi> his minde, we carrie our eyes in our hands, and beleeve no more then we see. What fond and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:25492:134"/>
foolish men are we, that seek for certaintie of such things as are most uncertain, which deceive us most when we make our selves most sure of them, which make themselves wings and flie away, whilest we think we have them fast enough in our hands! But, be it known unto all Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what assurance and securitie Christ the King of heaven will give; what assurance, I say, of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> life Christ will give unto all those that will enter bond for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of covenants: <hi>If thou</hi>

            <p>If a man should suffer in Hell but so many torments, as he hath lived houres, or but so many tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he hath committed sinnes all his life, this might seem some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:25492:135"/>
the more tolerable. If it were so, that in Hell there were any end of torments after the expiration of any certain number of yeares, men would make no end of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the dayes of their life; The enemies of God would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease every day more and more: For albeit they know that the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Hell are so many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that they cannot be numbered; so long for continuance, that they cannot be measured; so grievous for qualitie, that they cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured but with such infinite pain, that every minute of an houre shall seem a whole yeare: Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, men are nothing deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from sinne, but walk on boldly, or rather runne headlong to their own destruction.</p>
            <p>If all the torments that can be inflicted or imagined, should be heaped together upon the head of a man for an hundred yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would not come neare the punishments of Hell for one yeare, no not for a day, nor yet an houre. All the punishments that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:25492:136"/>
Theeves, Robbers, Murderers, and such Malefactours suffer, though grievous for the time, yet they are quickly ended; in three or foure dayes they are over, or in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of a week at most: But the torments of the damned are not for a yeare, or an age, but for ever. God shall ever punish them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he can never punish them enough, though he punish them to all <hi>Eternitie.</hi>

               <p>THis knew <hi>Theodorus</hi> very well, one born of Christian Parents, and as it seems he learned it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when for yeares he was but a youth, but an old man for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and discretion. For on a great Festivall day kept throughout all <hi>Egypt,</hi> there being a great feast at his fathers house, and many invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto, when some were eating and drinking, others laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and playing, and others sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dancing, he amidst all these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ollities retired himself to his inward closet, finding himself wounded to the heart, but with a chast arrow. For thus he began to expostulate with himself, Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Theodore!</hi> What would it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thee, if thou shouldst gain the whole world? Many things thou hast indeed; but canst thou tell
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:25492:142"/>
how long thou shalt enjoy them? Thou livest in abundance now, thou maist feast it and make merry, thou maist laugh and be fat, thou maist rejoyce and skip for joy: But art thou sure how long this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>all last? I should like it well, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> would last alwayes. But what shall I do? Shall I for the enjoying of these short and transitorie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delights, deprive my self of those joyes which are <hi>Eternall?</hi> Tell me <hi>Theodore,</hi> is this accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christian Religion, to frame unto our selves an heaven here on earth, and think to passe from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to delights, from <hi>Temporall</hi> to <hi>Eternall?</hi> Either I am much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or else Christ shewed unto us another way unto the kingdome of heaven, and that is through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tribulations. Therefore have no more to do with worldly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but preferre <hi>Eternall</hi> joyes before <hi>Temporall.</hi> Thus he said, and fell a weeping: So then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired himself into a withdrawing room, and there prostrating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the earth, he prayed after
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:25492:143"/>
this manner, Eternall God, my heart is naked and open before thee: I send up my sighs as hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Oratours</hi> and <hi>Petitioners</hi> unto thee; I know not what to ask, nor how. Onely this one thing I beg at thy hands, that thou wilt not suffer me to die an <hi>Eternall</hi> death. Lord thou knowest that I love thee, and that I desire to be with thee, that I may sing <hi>Eternall</hi> praises unto thee. Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie upon me. Whilest he was thus praying, in comes his mother on a sudden, and presently perceiveth by the rednesse and moistnesse of his eyes that he had been a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thereupon she saith, My Sonne what is the matter with thee? Why weepest thou? Why mournest thou? Why keepest thou out of sight to day? Why dost thou not come to the table? The rest are all there: Thy companie is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired: Come away. But <hi>Theodore</hi> answered and said, I pray you good mother have me excused: I finde my self somewhat ill at stomack, I pray you do not urge me to eat
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:25492:143"/>
or drink against my stomack. So with a fair and colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence he sent away his mother. Then being alone he conferred with God &amp; himself about <hi>Eternity,</hi> and strictly examined all the course of his life, saying unto himself, What am I? or, What have I been? How hath it been with me heretofore? or, How shall it be with me here after, if I lose my part and fellowship in the kingdome of heaven, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Eternitie?</hi> There are divers wayes to heaven: Some go one way, some another: It is no matter which way we go, so we come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But because all wayes are not alike, neither are all natures alike, every man ought to choose that way which is most convenient. There is a short way and a long, a safe way and a dangerous: If then I be afraid to go a long and dangerous way, there is a shorter and a safer, which if I shall choose, without all doubt I shall have the Angels for my companions and comforters, and they will rejoyce with me. But my friends will
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:25492:144"/>
grieve at it: at the first, it may be; but after a while they will also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. Well <hi>Theodore,</hi> deferre a while, but not too long, and do not yeeld too much. I hope I shall one day grow a strong man, and then I shall be better able to deal with mine enemies; for I shall finde those that are strong: But what if they be easie, flattering, fawning, and such as will even weep for me? The truth is, I am most afraid of such. But pluck up a good heart man, and though by nature thou art flexible, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily moved, yet pray unto Christ, and he will make thee strong and immoveable. But what if thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falls a weeping, beseecheth thee with her teares trickling down her cheeks? What if she hangs about thy neck, and desires thee to spare thy self? What if she shews thee her breasts which gave thee suck? Will not all these move thee? Here remember what Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> saith, Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing<note place="margin">Hierom</note> all these importunities, run with speed unto the Standard
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:25492:144"/>
of Christs Crosse: It is a vertue and praise-worthy to be cruell in such a case as this. It is the portion and inheritance of thy mother the Church to stand under the Crosse of Christ: So did <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Christ: and so must thou, if thou wilt have God thy Father in heaven, and the Church thy mother on earth: And so thou wilt do, if thou beest a true Sonne and no bastard. But must I do it now in my youth, in the very flower of mine age? That's hard. So it is indeed to flesh and bloud. But experience teacheth it, that God is not well pleased with late service: for late services are seldome good. Therefore they do well that begin to serve God betimes, that seek him early, and that remember him in the dares of their youth, and learn to submit their tender necks unto the yoke of Christ. But I have been brought up tenderly, I have been fed with d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and shall I now enter upon a strict and rigid course of life, and bid adieu to all my pleasures? Shall I be able to endure it? I hope I
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:25492:145"/>
shall. But, How long? For a yeare or two? That's not enough: I must go further, and continue to the end, even as long as I live. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore weigh and consider the matter well with thy self, before thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvest; and either never begin, or else continue to the end. I will by Gods assistance; for I hope he will not leave me alone to strive with these difficulties, which of my self I shall not be able to overcome. But it is a hard matter to strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst custome. I have hitherto li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved like a Noble man and a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and shall I now live like a poore man, and a slave? or, if I do, How long shall I live so? If I put on the poore mans person, and act in the <hi>Theatre</hi> of this world, when shall I put it oft? At the end of the last Act. And how farre is it thither? As long as it is to the last breath. Thy part is not ended, till thou art to depart out of this life. If thou once comest forth in the poore mans dresse, there is no putting it off again: Thou must not once think of thy silks, fattens,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:25492:145"/>
and velvets; Purple and fine linen thou must not weare, untill thou beest clothed with the robe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie and glory. <hi>Theodore,</hi> what thinkest thou? shalt thou be able to hold out to the last Act? I will strive what I can, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my self by the example of other good <hi>Actours</hi> that have gone before me. And whom should I choose rather to follow and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, then Christ the Sonne of God, who voluntarily became poore, and made himself of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, humbling himself above measure, to do and suffer like a servant, being Lord of all? And shall not I do and suffer any thing after his example? Shall not I take up the Crosse and follow him? Am I better then he? Why should I be afraid to follow, when I have such a Leader? For who is it? Who bids me follow him? It is the voice of man, that I heare; but it is the will of God, whom I ought to obey, because he commands. But this is too high a point of Philosophie, for a man
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:25492:146"/>
to forsake his riches, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace povertie. And, what wilt thou do <hi>Theodore?</hi> Resolve with thy self what to do.</p>
               <p>Why do I thus long doubt and dispute within my self? Why do I wave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thus between hope and feare? Have I not the example of my Lord before mine eyes? Did not he suffer many things not to be uttered? Was not he nailed to the Crosse and despitefully used? He forsook his heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and came poore into this world. His <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>death</hi> showes it. At his <hi>birth</hi> he wanted a cradle: in his <hi>life</hi> he had not where to hide his head: and at his <hi>death</hi> he had not wherewithall to cover his body. Naked came he into this world, and naked he went out. How was it with him in <hi>life?</hi> He was fain to slee from one place to another. He was often wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with travell, scorched with heat, and drie for thirst. He was as indefatigable in doing, as he was patient in suffering; and both in an high degree. Was ever any
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:25492:146"/>
one so well bent to poverty, so patient in labours, and so gentle &amp; milde when he was reproached? And should I be ashamed of such a Leader? Should I blush to be called one of his followers? Shall not I be content to be such as my Lord and Saviour will have me to be? I am ready for love of him to suffer hunger, thirst, cold, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, povertie, and such like. I am willing for his sake to be bound, burnt, and cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. These sufferings are but short, they cannot continue long. But the joyes or torments of <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> are long indeed: for they shall never have end. Therefore farewell all the world, and the things that are in it, I care not for you, I regard you not; Farewell, I say. But welcome <hi>Eternitie</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thou comest; Thou art the onely thing that I seek after, my soul longeth after thee, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I desire in comparison of thee.</p>
               <p>With the heat of such cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his soul was so set on fire,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:25492:147"/>
that it was inflamed with the love of <hi>Eternitie,</hi> which the blessed shall enjoy in heaven. Therefore he resolved to take leave of his parents, to forsake his riches, and bid adieu to his delights for ever. He did not resolve hastily, but continued in his resolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly. He was not soon hot, and soon cold: He was not altered all on the sudden: He did not passe from one extreme to another: He did not strive for the highest pitch at the first, but rose up by degrees, and became one of <hi>Pachomius</hi> his Scholars. You have heard the <hi>Prologue;</hi> But there follows no <hi>Tragedie</hi> after it: For, contrarie to the law of a <hi>Tragedie,</hi> we have a sorrowfull beginning, but a joyfull ending. He came forth with a <hi>Lachrymae,</hi> but went off with a <hi>Plaudite:</hi> At his <hi>Intrat</hi> there was weeping for grief, but at his <hi>Exit</hi> there was clapping of hands for joy. Thus you have heard the life and death of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> whose soul fed as it were upon thoughts of <hi>Eternitie,</hi> and was delighted
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:25492:147"/>
therewith as with marrow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. He was not of the worlds minde, which counteth <hi>Eternitie</hi> but a fable; but refused not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to become a fable and a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word in the world, being perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fully of a blessed <hi>Eternitie,</hi> and earnestly desiring and thirsting to have a part in it.</p>
               <p>Christian brethren, shall I speak a free word but a true? or, not I, but <hi>Theodorus?</hi> Most men live so, as if there were no such thing as <hi>Eternitie,</hi> as if it were but a meer fable, and feigned thing.

And yet, how many are apt to say, We beleeve that there is a blessed <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> after this life, we hope to have part in it, we have a desire and longing after it. But (alas!) How little is their faith! how vain is their hope! How cold is their desire!

and by little and little make the desire and love of <hi>Eternitie</hi> grow quite cold in them, as if they had drowned and buried it in the grave of oblivion. We heare it often read and preached, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, This is the commandment of the Lord:</hi> And as often as we heare it, we still neglect it.

Christ in all ages. There are whole books of them in great volumes: they are recorded to all posteritie, and their names shall be had in everlasting remembrance.

us; not because we shall not be, but because we shall not be like unto them. Whatsoever is written in the Scripture, is written for our learning, it is the voice of God. Observe and make good use of what you reade: Whatsoever we suffer in this life is but the gentle rod of our most mercifull father, who correcteth us here, as his deare children, that we be not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the damned hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>AMongst Christians, God knows, there are a great many, that either beleeve there is neither
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:25492:155"/>

                  <note place="margin">Luke 18. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Sonne of man cometh, shall he finde faith upon the earth?</hi> Some there are that would fain be thought to be true beleevers; They confesse it indeed with their mouthes, but dissemble with their double hearts: If their words may be beleeved, they may go for true beleevers; but if their lives be examined, they may be thought to be no better then Insidels. They never think upon <hi>Eternitie,</hi> or very seldome; and when they do, they do but think upon it, and there is all; it is gone in a thought, they never weigh well with themselves what it is, they never seriously meditate upon it, they never rouse their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to be intent upon it, they never bend their wills and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to seek after it, they never imprint it in their deep cogitations, that so they may remember it. They scarce begin to think upon it, but
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:25492:156"/>
their mindes are presently some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where else, their thoughts go a wandring, their imagination is working upon somewhat else: And if at any time some sparks of devotion and godly desires arise in their hearts, they are presently quenched and choked with cares of this world, with multitude of businesse, with profits or pleasures, and such like. And thus miserable men they stop their eares and close their eyes, and without fear or understanding they run hudwinkt in the way that leadeth to <hi>Eternall</hi> death. It is observed by the holy Fathers of the Glutton in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that he never lifted up his eyes till he was in torments: All his life long they were shut against the poore, and against all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: He opened them not till he was in Hell, when it was too late. And it is no marvell that so many men runne blind-fold to the house of slaughter, and <hi>Eternall</hi> sorrow: For the way is very broad and pleasant, smooth and plain, a man can hardly go out of it, there is no
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:25492:156"/>
fear of losing himself till he comes to the end thereof. Then he shall perceive that all the while he was travelling, he was quite out of the right way: then I say when there is no returning back again. Many would like this way well, if there were no end thereof: For though it rids merrily, it ends miserably; and therefore they do wisely, that leave the great rode, and travell on in the rough way; that choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go through briers and thorns unto an <hi>Eternall Paradise,</hi> then through a pleasant <hi>Paradise</hi> to an <hi>Eternall prison;</hi> that resolve with themselves to break through all difficulties, counting it better to go on weeping and mourning in the narrow way of salvation, rather then laughing and rejoycing in the broad way of destruction. Most true it is which <hi>Job</hi> speaketh, <hi>As</hi>

                  <hi>the cloud is consumed, and vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away: so he that goeth down to the grave, shall come up no more: He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</hi>

Let no man

once doubt of the truth hereof; for between that which is finite and that which is infinite there is no proportion. But this seems wonderfull and strange unto us, because our imagination cannot conceive it: It cannot reach unto that which is so farre remote; It cannot penetrate into that which is infinite, for that is impenetrable. And this is the reason that our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is so hardly drawn to the consideration of <hi>Eternitie:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it blusneth in a sort, and is ashamed, or else for indignation cannot endure to tire it self in the search of that which cannot be found out. But let us put away this foolish and shamefull modesty, and let us force our understanding to the due and serious contemplation of <hi>Eternitie,</hi> and let it be our daily exercise to be still medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon such similitudes as may in some sort shadow it out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it unto us: And so shall we never do amisse.

               <p>IT is not to be beleeved that any man that hath but the least smack of true Religion, can be so farre carried away by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and unruly passions (if he be not as bad as a beast ruled meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by sense, and serving onely his sensuall appetite: For the wicked and ungodly man even then when he is almost swallowed up in the deep pit, whereinto his sinnes have plunged him headlong, even then, I say, doth but laugh at it, regards it not, is not a jot troubled at it) It is not to be beleeved, I say, that any man that hath any Religion at all in him, can be so farre carried away by his head-strong and unbridled passions, but, if he will spend a part of an houre every day in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating upon <hi>Eternitie,</hi> yea if he will but once in a week seriously think upon it, he will mend his manners, he will change the course of his life to better, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly become a new man: Of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:25492:161"/>
a proud man, he will become humble and lowly; of an angry man, he will become milde and gentle; of an unclean man, he will become chaste and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; of a drunken man, he will become sober and temperate. He will put on, not the outward but the inward habit of a true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and godly man. He will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come such a one, not in clothes and outward expression, but in heart and inward affection. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he rashly and unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, slightly and negligently, upon a spurt all at once on the sudden passe from one extream to another: (such alterations are not good, neither will they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long) But he will again and again weigh the matter well with himself, he will consider well upon it, he will fasten his serious thoughts upon it, he will often revolve in minde <hi>Eternitie, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, Eternitie,</hi> that shall never have end, end never, never end; which shall last throughout innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, incomprehensible, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

ages. This will he do with consideration and attention, and often ruminate upon it, as beasts chew the cud. Meat, though never so good and wholesome, if it be not chewed in the teeth, prepared in the mouth, digested in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, turned into bloud, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed by the veins into all the parts of the body, turns to poyson rather then to nourishment, begets all manner of diseases, is retained perhaps some time in the body, but doth more harm then good, were a great deal better out then in Even so the thoughts of death, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Heaven and Hell are good and wholesome, godly and holy, but none more then the thought of <hi>Eternitie,</hi> which may worthily be called the <hi>Quintessence.</hi> But as it is with meat, not the taking of it meerly into the mouth, but the good digesting of it in the stomack, the turning of it into good bloud in the liver, and the distributing of it into all the parts by the veins, nourisheth the body: So it is with these precious thoughts of <hi>Death,

If this be not done, the rest is to little purpose: without this even the reading of the holy Scripture is fruitlesse, the hearing of the word preached is unprofitable. Many heare Sermons often, reade the Scripture over and over again, and yet are little bettered by it, because they do not meditate upon what they have both read and heard. When they heare, what comes in at one eare, goes out at the other: When they reade, the eye is no sooner off from the book, but what was read is soon slipt out of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. Before they can practise what they have heard or read, they have quite forgotten what they should do. Therefore if we will reade or heare with profit, we must

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:25492:165"/>
our thoughts to the contemplation of those things which are <hi>Eternall,</hi> and not subject to any change; if we would have an eye unto them and set our hearts upon them, we would certainly count the sufferings of this life, and whatsoever hath an end, to be as nothing; and again, <hi>joy in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation</hi> is a song in the night: For although we are outwardly afflicted with the sense of sorrows <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> yet we are inwardly comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the hope of joyes <hi>Sternall.</hi>

He that is punished, is the fathers heire; and he that goes unpunished, is disinherited. For, what should the father do? He sees there is no hope of him, and that he is past grace, and therefore he lets him alone to do what he
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:25492:168"/>
listeth. But yet notwithstanding the sonne which is ever and anon punished for the least offence, will be ready to bemone and deplore his own case, and count his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happy which goes unpunished. He will, I say, unlesse God hath given him a wise and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, to know what makes for his own good. He will be apt to say in his heart, My brother follows all ill courses, takes his pleasure, wastes his means, doth what seemeth good in his own eyes, is ever breaking my fathers commandments, and hath never an ill word for it. But the case is otherwise with me: If I be but out of sight never so little while, if I go but to the next doore, if I do but step aside, stirre but a foot, but an inch beyond my bounds, presently I am called in question, Sirrah where have you been? there is no hope of pardon, I am sure to smart for it. This is my case. And I say, Thou art in a farre better case then thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if thou beest not a fool,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:25492:168"/>
thou wilt think so too: For in that thou art corrected, it is a signe that thou art best beloved. If thou thinkest onely upon thy present state, it cannot but seem grievous unto thee: But if thou hast an eye to the inheritance which is reserved for thee, again it cannot but seem joyous unto thee. For the assurance of thy fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reward will quite take away the sense of the present smart.</p>
               <p>Hither may be added out of the same holy Father that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, as the summe of all that hitherto hath been said. How great and wonderfull is the mercy of God! He saith not, Labour thou for ten hundred thousand yeares together; nor yet, one thousand yeares; nor yet, five hundred yeares. But what?

                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:25492:169"/>To conclude then with the same divine authour, Let us therefore be in love with <hi>Eternall life;</hi> and thereby we shall come to know, how much we ought to labour for the obtaining of it: For we see that those men which are lovers of this present life, which is but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and shall shortly have an end, labour with might and main to preserve and prolong it as long as they can. And yet they cannot escape death: For that at one time or other will seize upon them. All that they can hope for, is but to put it off for a little time. When death approacheth, then every one is labouring and seeking to hide himself, ready to give, and part with any thing that he hath to redeem his life. He sends for the Physician, he will be ruled by him in any thing, he will take any thing at his hands, he will suffer any thing, purging, bleeding, cupping, scarifying, and what not? You see what charge a man will be at, and what pains he will vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily endure, to live here
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:25492:170"/>
though but for a short time: And yet he will scarce be at any charge, or take any pains, after this life ended to live for ever. Brethren, it should not be so. If there be such labouring and watching, such sending and going, such running and riding, such spending and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, such doing and suffering, to live here a while longer: What should we not willingly do and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, to live for ever? And if they be accounted wise, which labour by all means they can to put off death a while longer, being loth to lose a few dayes: What fools are they which live so, that finally they lose the day of <hi>Eternitie!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Think upon these things well with your selves O mortall men, and foresee the day of <hi>Eternitie,</hi> whether of joy or of torment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cometh. For although all other things passe away, yet <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> still remains, and shall never passe away.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Punishment of Eternall death.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Messenians</hi> had a certain prison or dungeon under earth void of aire and light, and full of Hellish horrour: which as it was a most dismall place, so had it also a glorious title; for it was called the <hi>Treasure-house.</hi> This prison or dungeon had no doores at all to it, onely one mouth, at which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners were let down by a rope, and so it was stopped up again with a great stone. Into this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure-house</hi> was <hi>Philopoemen</hi> that great <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> cast, and there by poyson he ended his life. God also hath his <hi>Treasure-house</hi> under earth, if I may so speak: But, I pray you, what a one is it? It is of most wicked and ungodly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate and damned men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Actiolinus</hi> a <hi>Tyrant</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> (as <hi>Jovius</hi> reports) had many prisons so infamous for all kinde of miseries and torments, that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:25492:171"/>
whosoever were cast thereinto counted their life miserie, and their death happinesse. Death might come in there without knocking, he was so welcome unto them, and so long lookt for. For this was their hard usage, They were laden with irons, starved with hunger, poisoned with stench, eaten up with vermine, and so in a most miserable manner they lived, and died at length a long and a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring death. There every one was judged most miserable but he that was dead, and could feel no mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Whilest they lived it was a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment worse then death, to have their habitation amongst the dead. For the dead bodies lay on heaps rotting amongst the living in such manner that it might be truely said there, That the dead killed the living.</p>
               <p>But the very worst of these pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is a <hi>Paradise,</hi> and a most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant place, if it be compared with the infernall prison of Hell. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever miserie was suffered in <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olinus</hi> his prison, in this regard it
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:25492:171"/>
was tolerable, because it was of no long continuance, being to last no longer then a short life, and quite vanishing away at the houre of death. But the Treasure-house of the damned, which is Gods prison, is void of all comfort: The tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof are intolerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <hi>Eternall:</hi> Death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter in there, neither can those that are entered get out again: But they shall be tormented for <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> For <hi>evermore?</hi> What a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing is this! They shall be tormented for <hi>evermore.</hi> It was a most true saying of <hi>Cassiodorus,</hi> As no mortall man can apprehend or understand what the <hi>Eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> is, so neither can any man conceive or imagine what that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall torment</hi> is.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> had a prison into which a man might enter easily, but being once in, could get out no more; or if he did, yet very hardly. And therefore it was called <hi>Lethe,</hi> or <hi>Oblivion.</hi> It is an easie matter to descend down into Hell; but to ascend up again it is altogether
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:25492:172"/>
impossible. Was ever any heard to return from Hell? This prison of Hell is not without just cause cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lethe,</hi> or <hi>Oblivion.</hi> For God is so unmindefull of the damned, that he will <hi>never</hi> remember them to have mercy upon them. Hell is called the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Oblivion</hi> or <hi>Forgetfulnesse,</hi> and that for two reasons (as a godly and learned Writer observes) First, Because, saith he, they remember God no more for their good, neither have they any memorie at all of things past, but such as doth afflict and torment them. All their pomp and glory, pleasures and delights are quite forgotten, or else not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred without grief and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Secondly, To those that are in this horrid Region, and lake of fire, God hath forgotten to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and mercifull, neither will he send his Angels at any time to minister unto them the least com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: If once in, there is no coming out again. For what said <hi>Abraham</hi> unto the rich Glutton frying in Hell, and desiring him
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:25492:172"/>
to send <hi>Lazarus</hi> to cool his tongue<note place="margin">Luke 16. 26.</note> with a drop of water? <hi>Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that they which would passe from hence to you, cannot; neither can they passe to us, that would come from thence.</hi> Oh gulf full of horrour and despaire! Oh <hi>Eternitie</hi> of torments, the very thought whereof is able to make a stout man quake and tremble! The wicked and ungodly men dig their own graves, and dwell therein for evermore: But what manner of graves do they dig? They dig as deep as Hell, where the rich Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was buried, from whence <hi>he lifted up his eyes in torments, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 16. 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>saw Abraham afarre off, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus in his bosome,</hi> to his greater torment. Oh what a terrible deep is this! Oh what a fearfull grave is this! Who lies here? He that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Lazarus</hi> to lie at his gate, having no compassion on him. How is it with him now? He lodgeth in flames of fire in stead of his soft bed: he is scalded with thirst, and his sweet cups are taken
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:25492:173"/>
from his mouth; his table is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and he hath no other food but fire and brimstone; He is not now dancing and exulting for joy, but gnashing his teeth for hellish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration. They that are shut up in prison here in this world, have hope for their comfort; it may be they shall be delivered, and redeemed out of prison: But from Hell there is no deliverance, no redemption, no not so much as any hope at all, but <hi>Eternall</hi> desperation.</p>
               <p>It is a short, but a terrible Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that God preacheth by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in these words, <hi>Say to the sorrest of the South,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 47</note> 
                  <hi>Heare the word of the Lord, Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devoure every green tree in thee, and every drie tree: The flaming flame shall not be quenched.</hi> How many tall Cedars, how many wicked and ungodly men flourish and wax green in this life for prosperous successe in all outward things, and yet are dry and withered for want of vertue! Heare this therefore every green
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:25492:173"/>
and yet dry and withered tree. <hi>I will kindle a fire, saith the Lord, and the flaming flame shall not be quenched.</hi> In Hell, whither you make such great haste, there are no Holy-dayes, no Festivals, no set times in which the fire shall cease burning. There is <hi>Eternall</hi> grief, <hi>Eternall</hi> death, <hi>Eternall</hi> sorrow without the mixture of the least comfort. Night and day there is no rest, no sleep at all, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall watching and waking for grief and anguish, and intolerable torments in everlasting fire. There shall you alwayes have your being, that you may alwayes be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: there shall you alwayes live, that you may alwayes die. If you will not beleeve me, beleeve Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> whose words are these, The ungodly, saith he, shall live<note place="margin">August</note> in torments: but they which live in torments shall desire, if it were possible, that their life were ended. But death heares them not, there is none to take away their life: Their life shall never end, because their torments shall never end.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:25492:174"/>
But what saith the Scripture? The Scripture doth not so much as call it life. For life is a name of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: but what comfort can there be imagined in tortures and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, frying and broyling in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting fire? But what doth the Scripture call it? <hi>The second death,</hi> that is, a death which follows af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the first and naturall death which is common to all men. But how can the second death be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a death, seeing that he that hath part therein never dieth? We may better indeed expresse what it is not, rather then what it is. As it cannot properly be called a death, so it may be truely said that it is no life: And as concerning them that have part therein, as they cannot properly be said ever to die, so again it may be most truely said that they never live. For so to live, that a man shall alwayes live in sorrows and torments, is not to live. Therefore that life is no life: But the onely life indeed is, that life which is blessed; and that life onely is blessed, which is <hi>Eternall.</hi> Again, we have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:25492:174"/>
place in the same Father to this purpose: If the soul liveth in <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August.</note> torments, tormented with the unclean spirits; This is rather to be called <hi>Eternall</hi> death, then <hi>Eternall</hi> life. For there is no greater or worse death, then that death which never dieth.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> also giveth the like testimonie. In Hell, saith he,<note place="margin">Gregor.</note> there shall be death without death, end without end, because death ever liveth, and the end ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth: there death shall never die. Oh death, how much sweeter wert thou, if thou wouldst take away life, and not compell those to live, who would fain die! But so it is: the number of the yeares in Hell are without number. It pasleth the skill of the best <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>thmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> to finde out the number there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. God himself knowes no end thereof. After a thousand thousand millions of yeares past, there are still as many more to come; and when those also are past, there are yet as many more to come; and still they are as farre from
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:25492:175"/>
the last as they were at the first. It is now above five thousand yeares since <hi>Cain</hi> that slew his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> was cast into the lake that burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone: and yet the number of the yeares throughout which still he is to be tormented, is as great still as it was the first day of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and after certain millions of yeares, the yeares of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their number shall be nothing diminished: It shall be all one as if he were cast into the fire but this present houre. And though the rich Glutton mentioned in the Gospel, be tormented two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares together, yet still he doth burn, and shall burn for ever; neither shall he obtain so much as a little drop of water, though he use never so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie, not so much as a little drop of water to cool his inflamed tongue.</p>
               <p>These things we often heare of, and when we heare them, we do but laugh at them. Certainly we count it but a light matter to burn
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:25492:175"/>
in <hi>Eternall</hi> fire. Here a man might well ask the question, <hi>where are your teares, O mortall men, ye that are given so much to laughing?</hi> This is our condition: A small losse, if it be but a matter of three halfpence, will wring great store of teares from us: But as for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and irrecoverable losse, that we can brook easily, we can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest that with laughter. When we are cited to appeare at the barre of an earthly Judge, then we quake and tremble: But as we are going to Gods Tribunall, (for every day we rid some of our way, we walk on step after step, will we, nill we; and yet as we are going) we sport by the way. When we go to sea, we are afraid of shipwrack: But without either fear or wit we lanch into the deep sea of <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> and make but a laughing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it.</p>
               <p>It is the wish of Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> Oh that men were wise! that they were wise! Oh that they were wise! What then, holy <hi>Bernard?</hi> Oh, then would the image of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:25492:176"/>
begin to be reformed in them. Then would they order things present wisely, judge of things past understandingly, and foresee things to come providently.</p>
               <p>Here we have Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and not his wish onely, for his words runne in the <hi>Imperative Mood,</hi> and not in the <hi>Optative,</hi> Brethren, <hi>see that ye</hi>

our time in idlenesse; to be calling for our cups, and sit so long at them till we cannot stand, This is not to redeem the time. But this is truely to redeem the time, To give our selves to labour and study, prayer and meditation; not for a spurt and away, but to hold on in this course constantly unto the end; This, I say, is truely to redeem the time. It is the counsell of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> to steal some time from our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly businesse. Will any man sue thee<note place="margin">August<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> at the common law?

               <p>So ought we to spare for no cost, but willingly part with any thing to gain an opportunitie of doing

The dayes of this life are full<note place="margin">Anselm</note> of sorrows, griefs, dangers, and tentations which ever and anon take from us the opportunitie of doing good; So saith <hi>Anselm.</hi> But if we let slip the opportunitie of doing good when it is offered, and let our dayes consume away in meere purposes of amendment of life, without bringing them to good effect: From thenceforth it is in vain to look for any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of doing good; we shall not obtain one minute of time; our losse is altogether irrecoverable.

                  <hi>multitude,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have now been with me three dayes, and have nothing to eat.</hi> Sweet Saviour, dost thou count it such a matter for us to abide with thee three dayes, and eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:25492:180"/>
And why, sweet Jesus, dost thou not rather tell us of the dayes of <hi>Eternitie,</hi> and the everlasting joyes wherewith we shall be abundantly satisfied in the kingdome of heaven? God taketh notice of the least service that we perform, and it is precious in his sight: He telleth the very hairs of our heads; and much more then will he tell the drops of bloud that are spilt for his sake, and put them up in the bottle of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>We may therefore very well cry out with Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> Oh! How<note place="margin">Hierom</note> great a blessednesse is this, To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great things for small, and <hi>Eternall</hi> things for <hi>Temporall;</hi> and further to have the Lord our debtour! But thou wilt be ready to say, It goes hard to be in sufferings every day; and though all other things might easily be endured, yet death is terrible. Christian brother, I am ashamed to heare thee say so: it is foolishly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and like a childe. Knowest thou not thus much? I know that I
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:25492:181"/>
ascend to descend, flourish to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, am young to grow old, live to die, and die to live blessed <hi>Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Trust</hi> therefore <hi>in the Lord for</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 26. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>ever: For in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again S. <hi>Augustine</hi> comes unto my minde, who upon the words of our Lord saith thus, Our Lord and Saviour concluded with these words, saying, <hi>These shall go away</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 46</note> 
                  <hi>into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life Eternal.</hi> It is life <hi>Eternall</hi> that is here promised. Because men love to live here upon earth, therefore life is promised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: And because they are much afraid to die, therefore life <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> is promised unto them. What wouldest thou have? Life? Well, thou shalt have it. What art thou afraid of? Is it Death? Well, thou shalt not suffer it. But they which shall be tormented in Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fire, shall have a desire to die; and death shall flie from them. <hi>To live long</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is no great matter; yea more, <hi>To live alwayes,</hi> is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but <hi>To live blessed,</hi> that is a

thing to be desired, that is a great matter indeed.</p>
               <p>Therefore thou shalt live in heaven, and shalt never die; There shalt thou live blessed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: for neither shalt thou suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any evil, neither shalt thou be in fear of suffering; for there, it is impossible to suffer any evil. There shalt thou possesse whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou canst desire; and what thou possessest, thou shalt desire still to possesse. Thou canst not be cast out of possession: And this shall satisfie thee.

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:25492:182"/>
at anothers table: His own bread and his own wine would not serve his turn, to appease his hunger, or to quench his thirst. There was other bread that he had a minde to, and other liquour that he so thirsted after, the bread of heaven, and the water of life. For what is the plenty and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all the Kings of the earth? It is nothing else but meere want. And what is the daintie fare at their great tables? It is but like the beggers pitcher, if it be compared with the fatnesse of Gods house, and his heavenly table. Come eat and drink, and be filled my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, shall the King of heaven say. This feast of mine shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ended; there shall come no sorrow after it: As it is <hi>To day,</hi> so shall it be <hi>For ever</hi> and <hi>ever.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himself: but he breaks forth again into this exclamation, Oh life of lives surpassing all life! Oh everlasting life! Oh life bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for ever? where there is joy without sorrow, rest without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:25492:182"/>
riches without losse, health without sicknesse (there is no such matter in this life) abundance without defect, life without death, perpetuitie without corruptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, beatitude without calamitie; where all good things are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect charitie, where all knowledge is in all things, and through all things, where the Majestie of God is seen in presence, where the minde of the beholders is filled with the bread of life: They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes behold Gods presence, and still they desire to behold it; they desire to behold it, and yet without anxietie; they are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with it, and yet without sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tietie.</p>
               <p>And that thou maist understand and know, good Christian brother, that this superexcellent glory, these celestiall riches, this heavenly kingdome is to be bought, heare what the same Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith; I have to sell, saith God, I have to sell; come and buy it. Lord what is it that thou hast to sell? I have rest: Come and buy
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:25492:183"/>
it. What is the price of it? The price is labour. And how much labour is <hi>Eternall</hi> rest worth? If thou wilt speak the truth and judge aright, <hi>Eternall</hi> rest is worth <hi>Eternall</hi> labour. It is true indeed; but do not fear: For God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull. For should thy labour be <hi>Eternall,</hi> thou shouldest never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to rest <hi>Eternall:</hi> But that thou maist attain at length to rest <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> therefore thy labour shall not be <hi>Eternall;</hi> not but that it is worth so much, but that thou maist at length get the possession of it. Indeed it is worth the price, though it be labour <hi>Eternall;</hi> But that it may be purchased and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, it is necessarie that the price thereof be but labour Temporall. Therefore Christian brethren, let us rouse up our selves, and stirre up one another with this exhortation of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> which here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>Let us set before our eyes the<note place="margin">August.</note> life which is <hi>Eternall,</hi> and let us well consider the nature of it, which we shall come the better
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:25492:183"/>
to understand, by removing from it whatsoever we account trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some in this life. For it is easier to finde what it is not, rather then what it is. And yet it is set to sale. Thou maist buy it, if thou wilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou shalt not need to be much troubled or turmoiled about it, for the greatnesse of the price. The price is whatsoever thou hast, and no more. Never examine what thou hast, but consider what thou art. It is worth thy buying, though thou givest thy self for it. Give thy self, and thou shalt have it. What? Art thou to seek thy self? Art thou to buy thy self? Behold, such as thou art, if thou canst be content to give thy self, thou shalt have it. But thou wilt be ready to say it may be, Alack! I am a wicked man; And such a man perhaps will not be received for good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: If thou beest not already good, do but give thy self, and by so doing thou shalt become good, and go for current. Do but make a faithfull promise to give thy self; and this shall make thee
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:25492:184"/>
good: And being made good thou art a price of thy self good enough: And thou shalt have, as I said, not onely health, safety, life, and such like as shall have an end; but also thou shalt be freed from many miseries: Thou shalt neither be wearied nor stand in need of rest, thou shalt neither hunger nor thirst, neither increase nor decrease, neither grow young nor wax old, because there is no being born there; For there is full growth and stature, and the entire and perfect number of yeares. There is no num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber like unto it: For as it hath no need of being augmented, so is there no fear of being diminished: Behold what excellent things are spoken of it! And yet I cannot come neare telling thee what it is, or what good things are treasured up in it: For, as it is written, <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor eare heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it entred into the heart of man.</hi> And how should my mouth be able to utter what the heart of man is not able to conceive?</p>
               <p>And because we have gone along
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:25492:184"/>
through S. <hi>Augustines</hi> books as it were through so many pleasant gardens, and are now brought at length to the Celestiall <hi>Paradise,</hi> Let us seal and confirm what hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath been spoken, by the testimonie of the same Father. If we were every day, saith he, to suffer all torments, yea the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell it self, and that for a long time together, to the end that we might behold Christ in his glory, and have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fellowship with the Saints: were it not worth our pains and sufferings? Who would not suffer any sorrow, to be made partaker of so much good, and so great glory? Let the Devils then lie in wait for me, let them assault with tentations; let my body be brought down with fasting, let my flesh be kept under with pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; let me be wearied with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, let my moisture be dried up with watching; let one man cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour against me, let another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet me; let me be bowed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with cold, let me be set on fire
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:25492:185"/>
with heat; let my conscience mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, let my head ake, let my breast be inflamed, let my stomack be troubled with ventosities, let my countenance wax pale and bleak, let me be full of infirmities; let my life consume away with grief, and my yeares with mourning; let rottennesse enter into my bones, and let it spring up like a fountain under my feet; Let all these miseries come upon me, so that I may have rest and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the day of tribulation, and ascend up unto the people of the Lord. For, What shall be the glory of the just, and how great shall the joy of the Saints be, when every face shall shine as the Sunne! When the Lord shall begin to reckon up his people in their distinct orders, in his Fathers kingdome; and when he shall render unto every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works, the rewards which he hath promised, that is <hi>Heavenly</hi> for <hi>Earthly,</hi> and <hi>Eternall</hi> for <hi>Temporall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Think therefore upon the dayes of old, and call to minde the yeares
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:25492:185"/>
which are yet for to come. Think upon <hi>Eternitie,</hi> O man, think upon <hi>Eternitie;</hi> Think upon the <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> of Torment, and the <hi>Eternitie</hi> of Joy, which is to follow after this short life ended, and I dare warrant thee, thou wilt never complain of any adversitie, thou wilt never let slip out of thy mouth such a word as this, <hi>This is too grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,</hi> or, <hi>This is intolerable,</hi> or, <hi>This is too hard:</hi> Thou wilt, I dare say, count all things easie and tolerable whatsoever can happen in this life, and thou wilt never be better pleased then when thou art most afflicted.</p>
               <p>It is reported by <hi>John Moschus</hi> of one <hi>Olympius,</hi> an old man of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular patience, who lived cloystered up in a Monasterie neare unto <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> that he had his minde so bent and fixt continually upon <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> that he had scarce any sense or feeling at all of any temporall sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or miserie. For (as he goes on with his storie) Upon a time, as it hapned, a certain religious man turned out of his way to visit him,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:25492:186"/>
and finding him in a dark <hi>Cell,</hi> a place, as he thought, inhabitable by reason of heat and swarms of gnats and other flies, not without much admiration spake thus unto him, And canst thou, <hi>Olympius,</hi> endure to live in such a close room, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hot, and so much pressed with gnats and swarms of flies? But what did <hi>Olympius</hi> answer? And dost thou wonder at this? I tell thee, my sonne, all these are but light matters; I count them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, that so I may escape <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> torments, which are intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. I can endure to be stung by gnats, that so I may not feel the sting of Conscience, and the gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the worm that never dieth. This heat which thou so complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of I can suffer easily, when I think upon the <hi>Eternall fire</hi> of Hell, which is unsufferable. These troubles, if I may so call them, are but short, and shall have an end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the torments in Hell are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. Whereupon said the other, Certainly, <hi>Olympius,</hi> thou art led by the spirit of wisdome and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:25492:186"/>
truth; so wisely and truely hast thou answered. I would there were more of thy minde, that would think thus seriously upon these things! Then certainly there would be more then there are now adayes, that would after thy example patiently suffer and endure all things.</p>

What I have said before I here say again, because it cannot be said too often, though I should say it a thousand times; Whatsoever we think, speak, or do, once thought, spoke, or done, it is <hi>Eternall,</hi> it abideth for ever.</p>
               <p>Will you heare what S. <hi>Gregorie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Greg.</note> saith? In all our actions we must use great care and circumspection, we must well weigh and consider with our selves what it is that we take in hand, and to what end we do it, that our mindes be not set upon any thing that is <hi>Temporall,</hi> but upon those things which are <hi>Eternall.</hi> Therefore in all thy actions labour to be perfect. Pray for <hi>Eternitie,</hi> study for <hi>Eternitie,</hi> suffer for <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> contend for <hi>Eternitie,</hi> labour for <hi>Eternitie.</hi> So live to God, that thou maist live with God; So live on Earth, that thou maist live in Heaven; So live for <hi>Eternitie,</hi> that thou maist live to <hi>Eternitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heare also what S. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</note> Our works do not passe away as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:25492:188"/>
as they are done (as they may seem to do) but as seeds sown in time they rise up to all <hi>Eternitie.</hi> The foolish man which hath no understanding will wonder to see such a plentifull increase rise up of such little seeds, be it good or be it evil, according to the nature of the seed which is sown. But he that is wise will ponder these things, and count no sinne little: For he hath an eye still not to that which is present, but to that which is to come; not to that which is sown, but to that which is reaped; not to that which is done in time, but to that which remains to all <hi>Eternitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh the dangerous and miserable madnesse of the sonnes of <hi>Adam!</hi> God created us unto the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of infinite and <hi>Eternall</hi> goods: And why are we carried then with the whole bent of our affections to those things which are flitting and vanishing? God made us heirs of Heaven and <hi>Eternall</hi> possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And why do we so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entangle our selves in our vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:25492:188"/>
and run headlong to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Let us be wise in time, let us look well to our steps, let us make speed on the way of <hi>Eternitie:</hi> Let us so live that we may live to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie.</hi> The way thither is short and narrow, but the Term thereof is very large.</p>
               <p>But O miserable and foolish men that we are! We fain would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Eternall</hi> life; but we are loth to tread in the way that leads to it: we fain would be there; but we will not take pains to go thither. Every man desires to be blessed. There is no man, saith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August</note> of what condition or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree soever he be, but hath a desire after that life which is blessed for ever: Therefore that life is the common haven at which all men desire to arrive; but all men know not how to steere their course a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: It is a thing which all men without controversie would fain possesse; but how to compasse it, what course to take, which way to go, that is the point they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree upon. We may seek it
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:25492:189"/>
long enough upon earth; and it is a question, whether we shall ever finde it or no: Not that I condemne the seeking of it, but the not seeking it in the right place. One is of opinion that the Souldiers life is most blessed: but another denies that, and sayes, The life of the Husbandman is most blessed: And again, this another denies, and sayes that the Lawyers life is most blessed; and he gives his reason for it: For the Lawyer is worshipped by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and is much sought unto, he is ever taking of fees and pleading causes.</p>
               <p>And again, this another denies, and sayes, The Judges life is most blessed: For he hath power of hearing causes and deciding them. And yet again, another denies this, and sayes, The Merchants life is most blessed: For he sees divers countreys, learns many fashions, gathers together much wealth. You see, dearely beloved, in so many severall kindes of lives there is not any one to be found that will
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:25492:189"/>
please all. But the life blessed for ever, that is it which pleaseth all.</p>
               <p>Blessednesse therefore is not to be expected here, but is to be sought for elsewhere, and never to be found out but by a good and godly death. Ungodly men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves desire to die the death of the godly, but they will not live the life of the godly: For to die well is the way to felicitie; but to live well is matter of labour: And yet that is not to be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this. <hi>Eternitie</hi> depends upon death: and there is no dying well, without living well. Choose which thou wilt, life or death. If thou livest well, thou canst not but die well; and it shall be well with thee for ever: If thou livest not well, thou canst not hope to die well; but it will be ill with thee for ever.</p>
               <p>Not many yeares ago a man of a good house, having more wit in his head, then religion in his heart, being asked what he thought of the strict lives of the religious, and the loose lives of the licentious,

Once dead, and alwayes dead. He that dies once ill, is damned for ever. There is no returning again to life, to amend what was done amisse.

badge and cognizance of the elect, that they know how to carry themselves in the way of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life in such manner, that by the certainty of hope they are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that they have attained unto a great pitch, in as much as they see all transitorie things farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them, and for the love of <hi>Eternitie</hi> trample all sublunarie things under their feet. And this is it which the Lord speaketh by the mouth of his holy Prophet, saying unto every soul that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth him, <hi>I will lift thee up above the high places of the earth.</hi> For as for losses, reproaches, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie, disgrace and such like, these are, as I may so call them, the lower places of the earth, which the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of this world, as they walk through the plain of the broad way, do not love to come neare, but keep off as farre as is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But as for gain and profit, the fawning and flattering of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, abundance of riches, honours, and places of dignitie, these are the high places of the

For as it is with a man going up an high mountain, still the higher he goes, the lower he sees the earth beneath him: So is it with him whose conversation is in heaven, The higher he mounts from the earth with the wings of pious cogitations, the farther he flies from the earth with the wing of his affections.

either sollicit thee with love, or terrifie thee with fear; thou shalt plainly perceive what a small thing it is, whatsoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the <hi>Centre</hi> of the world, that little <hi>globe,</hi> or <hi>point</hi> of earth; thou shalt plainly perceive how that all things created are vain, weak, short, vile, yea va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie it self, yea rather meere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in respect of God and of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie.</hi> Therefore seek thou af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the onely true and soveraigne good, and regard not other things. Trust in God, relie on him, open thy heart wide to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him; tread under the feet of thy affections whatsoever is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne and Moon, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever allureth thee with smiles, or terrifieth thee with frowns; think upon <hi>Eternitie,</hi> and alwayes keep in minde that excellent saying of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> No labour must seem hard, no time must seem long, all the while we are seeking after <hi>Eternall</hi> glory.</p>
               <p>It is reported by Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> that there was upon a time a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

Camell haunted by an evil spirit, which being brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hilarion</hi> a devout and godly man, began to rage in such a strange and terrible manner, as if it would presently have devoured him: But the holy man nothing afraid spake thus unto the evil spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Do not think to fright me, thou evil spirit, although that thou hast got a Camel on thy back; it is all one to me, whether thou comest in a Camels skin or in a Foxes skin: And presently the fierce Camel fell down before him, and became very tame and gentle, to the great laughter of all those that stood by. Such are all flatteries, fawnings, allurements, and tentations of this world; such are all fears, frowns, frights and terrours. What dost thou hope for? what dost thou fear? what dost thou love? He that rideth upon the Heavens is thy helper; he shall embrace thee with his everlasting arms. With those arms of his, he is able to fetter all thine enemies whether they

Doth the pleasure then of lust, or glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie, or intemperance sollicit thee? That is nothing: Be not moved at it, passe it by, regard it not; think rather upon the pleasures which are <hi>Eternall.</hi> Art thou terrified with threats, oppressed with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, passed by with contempt, afflicted with sicknesse, tired out with povertie? All these are a matter of nothing. The more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent these are, the shorter while they will last: Despise them, lift up thine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh thy help, look up to heaven, <hi>Think upon Eternitie.

Not tearing the hair from her head, or rending her clothes, or laying open her breasts, or making grievous lamentation as the manner of foolish women is to do: But carrying her self like an Heroicall and Christian Lady. For she cryed out and called unto her sonne and said, <hi>Sonne, my sonne I say, remember life Eternall, look up to heaven, lift up thine eyes to him that reigneth there. Life is not taken from thee, but is exchanged for a better.</hi> At which words of his mother the young man was so exceedingly animated, that he went willingly to execution, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully like a stout champion laid down his head upon the block, and exposed his throat to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ax.</p>
