            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received your Letter, full of Zeal, and Christian Piety, the Contents whereof may be reduced to these six heads, wherein you desire resolution; first, what my sense is of the Anabaptists; secondly, when was the spring and rise of them; thirdly, what is the cause of this present growth, and increase of them; fourthly, why they are permitted; fifthly, what I think of Disputes and Conferences had with them; sixthly, a true Relation of that had with us of late, (which you say is variously reported) of all which briefly I'le endeavour to give satisfaction. For the first, I referr you to the Sermon, and Conference here following, to the Harmonies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
<pb facs="tcp:98780:69"/>
of the Reformed Churches, of all Churches since the Apostles, especially the Western, where you shall find Universali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Antiquity, and Succession (besides many pregnant places of Scripture) pleading for Infant-baptism; And that (as <hi>Austin</hi> saies) which the whole Church holds, was never begun by any Councel, but alwaies observed, cannot otherwise be believed, but that it came from the Apostles. For the second, the spring and rise of Anabaptism, as all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, so it had its beginning after Truth, the Husbandman first sowed good Corn, then the Enemy Tares; No Age was free: In the first hundred years arose the <hi>Ebionites, Chiliasts,</hi> and <hi>Gnosticks</hi>; In the second, the <hi>Marcionites, Valentinians,</hi> and <hi>Montanists</hi>; In the third, the <hi>Novatians, Sabellians,</hi> and <hi>Manichees</hi>; In the fourth, the <hi>Arrians, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists,</hi> and <hi>Eunomians</hi>; In the fifth, <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Eutychians,</hi> and <hi>Patripassians</hi>; In the sixth, <hi>Jacobites, Armenians,</hi> and <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelites;</hi> in which time the Mysterie of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity began more fully to work, which was first nascent, then crescent, then regnant, then triumphant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98780:69"/>And no sooner appeared a Reformation in <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, but there were <hi>Herods</hi> that sought the life of this Babe, Dragons watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while the Woman was travelling, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Child; Amongst whom the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists of <hi>Germany</hi> were most venemous; The first Author whereof was one <hi>Nicholas Stock,</hi> then <hi>Phipher, Knipperdoling, Munster,</hi> with their Tayler-King <hi>John Beccold</hi> of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who gave out that he had a Commission from Heaven to destroy all Nations that would not submit to his Gospel, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized; raging with sword and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till he was taken, and being examined by exquisite tortures, confessed he received his Doctrine from an impure spirit; there you have the spring and rise of it.</p>
            <p>Now for the third, the present growth, and increase of it, the reasons may be many; 1. Times of division, wherein the hedge of Discipline is broken down; Liberty in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is like free conversing without restraint, or watch in time of pestilence, one house ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily infects a whole City. 2. Satan's malice, like a River, the further it goes, the deeper, and fiercer. 3. The corruption of man's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:98780:70"/>
more inclinable to errour than truth. 4. The fitness of the engin for devastation, and ruinating all former Churches, under colour of first-baptisms nullity, gathering of new ones (after their own mould) out of the old ruins, by re-baptizing. 5. The pretence that Children are uncapable of Church-membership, or Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>And that by washing, as the Proselytes and Jews Children were initiated.</hi>
               </note> as if there were not the same capacity under the Gospel, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law. 6. False allegation that Infant-baptism is occasion of loose living, as if the native Jews that were sealed when Infants, were more dissolute than the Proselytes. 7. To limit it to ripe years, increases Piety, as if Jews, and Turks, and their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized converts, were not more frequently guilty of Apostasie and Hyprocrisie. 8. Not understanding that Infants Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the Old Testament, is not repealed, but confirmed in the New. 9. A carnal esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that the Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was partly carnal, of which Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is a part, as if Godliness in both Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments had not the promise of this life, and
<pb facs="tcp:98780:70"/>
of the life to come 10. That Circumcision was the seal of righteousness of Faith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not his Posterity. 11. That the Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Spiritual Seed onely, and not with visible Professors. 12. That there is no such thing as National Churches, though Christ saies, <hi>Make Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all Nations,</hi> and <hi>Isaiah</hi> saies, <hi>All Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall flow in, &amp;c.</hi> yet (they say) all Churches must be gathered by actual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, as well in Christian Nations, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Turks and Pagans. 13. Because we have no particular instance <hi>in terminis,</hi> that any Infants were baptized, and because they are not expresly named in the precept, as if generals did not include particulars, as well for Infants as Old Men. 14. Denying equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valencies, and necessary consequences from Scripture. 15. A vilifying of the judgement and persons of all godly and learned men of this present, and former ages, building up their rotten foundations upon their ruins. 16. Temporal interests of the lowest of the people, which while they dream its coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by men in power, cry <hi>Hosanna</hi> to day, and perhaps <hi>Crucifie</hi> to morrow. 17. A
<pb facs="tcp:98780:71"/>
pretending to the Spirit of God; <hi>Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius</hi> feigned that he conversed with the Goddess <hi>Egeria, Minos</hi> with <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Cave, <hi>Solon</hi> with the Delphian <hi>Apollo, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> with the Angel <hi>Gabriel; Montanus,</hi> and the Shakers, with the Holy Ghost; the white Witches, with the Spirit in the shape of a Dove, and all but to palliate their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found opinions and practises. Let not his Soul prosper that does not acknowledge and thirst after the true Spirit of God, yet let us try the Spirits, and not believe every lying Spirit. 18. The learning, subtilty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, of some Anabaptists, to gain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes; <hi>Arrius, Pelagius, Marcion,</hi> were not wiser in their generation than they, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veagle the poor simple people, especially Women and inferiour Tradesemen, which in seven years can scarce learn the Mysterie of the lowest profession, think half seven years enough (gain'd from their worldly imployments) to understand the Mysterie of Divinity, and thereupon meddle with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, which they have no more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to pry into, than a Batt to look up into the third Heaven. These, and many more,
<pb facs="tcp:98780:71"/>
are the causes of the increase of Anabaptism. Now, for the Fourth, you enquire why they are permitted, and their Books printed, and published, seeing those of <hi>Arrius</hi> of old, Dr. <hi>Pocklington</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Archer</hi>'s of late (more innocent) were burned? To satisfie you in this, something is to be imputed to the Providence of God, something to the Wisdome of the State. The Providence of God, who suffers Errours, 1. That Truth by opposition may more diligently be searched out. 2. That the sincerity and constancy of the Faithfull may be tryed. 3. That the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, and proud in spirit, may be blinded and hardned. The wisdome of State, who like wise Chirurgions, will not launce a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Ulcer, till it be ripe; a skilfull Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, that will not purge some floating hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, till they be setled. Therefore the late Parliament declared, that they would not have them cudgell'd, but perswaded out of their Errours. The <hi>two Lights of our Goshen</hi> (though they differ in judgment from them) endeavour not to force them,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cradock,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Walter. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothshire.</hi>
               </note> but by sweet insinuations and
<pb facs="tcp:98780:72"/>
arguments to win them; Besides, some of them have been esteemed Godly, amongst which Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> may be ranked; who knows but that may be verified of him, that was of <hi>Cyprian, Non videt haec, ut videat me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liora,</hi> he sees not these things, that he may see better things? God, it may be, suffers him to fall, with <hi>Peter,</hi> that his rise may be more glorious, <hi>Tu conversus, confirma Fratres,</hi> that being converted, he may strengthen his Brethren; will burn his Stubble, Hay, Wood, with the Spiritual Fire of the Word, or affliction, that his Gold may be the purer. Fifthly, you enquire whether it may be fit to dispute, and conferr with them, seeing their Doctrine eats as a Canker, for which cause the Empress would not suffer her Son <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> to discourse with the Heretick <hi>Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius.</hi> To which I answer; the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, is the onely Weapon to wound the hairy scalp of False Teachers; with this, Christ confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Sadduces; St. <hi>Peter, Simon Magus; Athanasius,</hi> the <hi>Arrians; Austin</hi> the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Manichees.</hi> There are none that speak against seasonable Disputes, but either
<pb facs="tcp:98780:72"/>
those that understand them not, or with spiritual pride storm against those that are gifted with that faculty above them, or they that cannot endure that their Errours be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked, and their Soars galled; Camels, conscious of their deformity, trouble the water, Foul Faces love not the Looking-glass. True it is, we ought to receive the weak in faith, not to doubtfull disputations; but when False Teachers have infused Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, may we not apply an Antidote? when they have sowed Darnel, and Cockle, may not we weed them out? This is to set Towns and Cities on fire, and to deny Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets to quench them; to suffer Invasions, and to permit none to rally together an Army to resist them. The Disputes at <hi>Bewdly, Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Ross,</hi> have been suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfull to astonishment; and in this last at <hi>Abergavenie</hi> (though tumultuary, and on a sudden) hath appeared the Finger of God; he that with Spittle, and Clay, opened the Eyes of the Blind, overthrew the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> with the sound of Ramms-horns, with these weak means hath wrought strong effects, that no Creature may glory in the Arm of Flesh.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:98780:73"/>To the relation whereof (in the last place) and the occasion of it, I come now; which was thus; Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> for several months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether being importuned by Letters and Messengers, came at length to water that, which Mr, <hi>Miles, Prosser,</hi> and others had planted, or (as some think) to confirm a Child lately baptized in <hi>London</hi>; when he entred the Pulpit, great expectation was, what Mountains would bring forth; his Text was <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that Infant-baptism was a nullity, a mockery; no Baptism but by Dipping, or Plunging, was lawfull; all that would be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved must be re-baptized, or baptized after profession; that there was no such thing as Infant-baptism in the Primitive times, but that it came in with other corruptions, upon unsound grounds; and challenged the whole Congregation to speak, if they had any thing to say to the contrary. There were many well learned that heard him, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially two, Mr. <hi>Bonner</hi> a neighbouring Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> Schoolmaster of the Town, formerly a Fellow of <hi>Jesus</hi> College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who both for the present
<pb facs="tcp:98780:73"/>
kept silence, onely Mr. <hi>Bonner</hi> closed with him in the way to his Lodging, and told him, that he had delivered some things contrary to that he had read in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and other things that grieved his spirit to hear, and desired therefore to conferr with him thereabout the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: He slighted the grave old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with as much contempt, as <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk did the British Commissioners at <hi>Bangor,</hi> yet told him, that he would tarry in the Town till such an hour; In the mean time, the greatest part of the People were offended, stagger'd, or scrupled, some not knowing what to think of their own, their Children, and their Ancestours sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The Anabaptists that night, and especially the next morning, triumphed, saying, where are your Champions now? some of them are struck dumb, others dare not shew their faces, whil'st Master <hi>Tombs</hi> is in the Town, naming Mr. <hi>Cragge,</hi> another neighbouring Minister; the report whereof being brought unto him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired instantly to the Town, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:98780:74"/>
with Mr. <hi>Bonner</hi>; and Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> they went all together to Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> where he was at a private house; little was said there, by reason of the throng of people pressing in; but it was agreed upon, that they should meet in the Church, or Publick Meeting place, at one a Clock, which was done accordingly; Mr: <hi>Tombs</hi> took the Pulpit, the Opponents a Seat over against it: Mr. <hi>Bonner</hi> was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to give the On<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>et, but a Gentleman disswaded him, by reason of his age, and bodily infirmities, lest it should impair his health; Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> began, Mr. <hi>Cragge</hi> succeeded, continuing the opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them for almost five hours. When the Dispute was ended, Mr. <hi>Cragge</hi> was desired by many Godly Persons to preach upon the same Text Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> had done, the Lords Day following, which he did accordingly; I send you here enclosed the sum of all; a Copy of Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s Conference, which a Friend procured me from his own hand, Mr. <hi>Cragge</hi>'s Sermon and Dispute, I took from his own mouth

            <p>TO please my self, and perhaps thee, I shall displease many; First, my Friend, for making his private token a publick frolick. Secondly, Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> for bringing him in this last Catastrophe wounded in the heel by <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> who vaunts that in former Scenes, (like <hi>Achilles,</hi> so far as he was dipped in the River by his Mother <hi>Thetis)</hi> he hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierced by the Weapons of the stoutest <hi>Hectors.</hi> Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Cragge,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> for exposing their Disputes, conceived in an hour and an half, and the Sermon contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a day and a half, to long censure. Fourthly, the Anabaptists (as they will deem)
<pb facs="tcp:98780:76"/>
for too uncourteously galling their soars. Fiftly, their Adversaries the Paedobaptists, for too courteously, or (as they will fancy) partially concealing Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> harsh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and his Favourites Incivilities. Sixtly, the Learned in general, for bringing these <hi>Nilus</hi>-like hatched Births in a moment into the open Amphitheater with those Elephants that have been ten years in conception. My Apologie for the whole is as followeth; The bulk of this Manual is small, some may reach to the price of it, that cannot of those larger Volumes; may have time to read it, that cannot them. The method of this is facile, the language plain, some will understand this, that cannot them. Besides, we naturally love the transactions of those, whose persons we know; Some heard them transiently as they were delivered, and would be glad delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to read them; Some heard them not, but at the second hand, as they were vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously reported (according to the judgement and affection of the Relator) who would be willing to know the business truly stated. If any of the Parties cencerned find themselves aggrieved, and intend to bend their stile
<pb facs="tcp:98780:76"/>
against me, I'le answer them at the Day of Judgement, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed: In the mean time, if Truth may be advanced, Errour discouraged, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness countenanced, Hypocrisie unmasked, thou edified, God glorified, I have mine ends. Farewell.</p>

               <p>You must deny it, either because the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seed, is not the same in substance with that which is now actually in force with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and their Children, or Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Baptism succeedeth not in the room of Circumcision.</p>

               <p>For the Former. That the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seed, is the same which is now actually in force with belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, appears by comparing <hi>Genes.</hi> 17.2. with <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.14. where it is clearly set forth, that the promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> came unto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> through <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Here he distinguisheth of a towfold seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the naturall, and spirituall, and saith, that the covenant was made with</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams <hi>spirituall seed, and not the naturall.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>V.</speaker>
               <p>Even all the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> were Circumcised, and consequently admitted into the covenant, not one excepted; for every Man-child was to be Circumcised, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. It appears by what hapned to <hi>Moses</hi> for not circumcising his Child, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24. Even <hi>Ishmael</hi> was circumcised, <hi>Genes.</hi> 17.23: who belonged not to the promise, but was of the naturall seed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Ishmael, <hi>and the naturall Children of</hi> Abraham <hi>were admitted to the externall part, namely outward privileges, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall blessings, and not to the internall, or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall part thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98780:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>By the Internall part he must needs mean that part of it expressed <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. in these words, <hi>To be a God unto thee, and unto thy seed after thee,</hi> and in the end of <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>I will be their God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To justifie this his distinction, he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and I think <hi>v.</hi> 8. where the Children of the promise are contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the Children of the flesh, or the naturall Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>; So that the covenant was made not to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to such of them as were elect, and faithfull.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>V.</speaker>
               <p>This covenant was made alike in the same extent, and latitude, promiscuously with all the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>; and those that lost the promise, and the benefit of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (which men you call the naturall seed) lost it not because they were not at first comprehended in the covenant, but because of their own unbeleef, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. I confesse that the Children of <hi>Isaack</hi> are, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. called the Children of the promise, not in regard of any peremtory election, or designation to faith, and Salvation, or on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98780:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the contrary<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> of any absolute reprobation of the seed of <hi>Ishmael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if it had been <hi>Pauls</hi> designe to declare the Children of <hi>Ishmael,</hi> yea the greatest part of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to have been rejected by a certain absolute decree, why should he <hi>v.</hi> 1.2. so much lament their incredulitie? wish himself accursed for their sakes, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 1. desire, and pray for their conversion? since upon such an absolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of reprobating them, all that happened to them was inevitable.</p>
               <p>But the Children of <hi>Isaack</hi> are called the Children of promise, First, because they onely were to inherite the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because Christ according to the flesh was to descend from the progenie of <hi>Isaack,</hi> not of <hi>Ishmael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might have added, that if none but the elect, and faithfull, can be admitted into the covenant, there is no subject left for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Baptism, it being impossible for man to know who are elect, spirituall, and true believers. Neither can you Baptize with right, or safety, all such grown persons as you Baptize, since you cannot be assured that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98780:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they are elect, Spirituall, or true believers, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 2.17.) nor have any light to guide you, save that of charitable opinion, and conjecture.</p>
               <p>Again, it being admitted that none but the Spiritually, elect, and believing, can be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, the same charitie that swayes your judgment for grown persons, must much rather move you to hope the best of innocent infants, guiltie of no actuall sin, since it hopes all things, and thinks no evill, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. They may have faith (<hi>in semine &amp; habitu)</hi> in the seed (as they have the habit of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and reason) tho they cannot exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it till ripe years. 3. Though they have not actuall faith, yet the faith of their parents may, and doth, put them into a capacitie of being admitted into the covenant, nor is it news that the parents faith advantageth the Children. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.50.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I could wish you could prove that Infants of believers might be admitted to Baptism by virtue of their parents faith.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>They were admitted into the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by Circumcision, into which we are admitted now by Baptism, but Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98780:14"/>
is a <hi>seal of the righteousness of faith, Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12. Whence it will follow, that either they had the righteousness of faith inherent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in themselves, or that of their parents im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them (chuse you whether) or else it will follow that Circumcision was a false seal.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not said there that Circumcision was the seal of righteousness of the Childrens faith, but onely of</hi> Abrahams <hi>own faith in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</hi>

               <p>But the covenant, or promise, was the same and alike to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. and alike to us believers, and to our Children, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This truth appears yet further from. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7- 14. Where we find that the faith of either of the parents makes the Children ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at least in that degree of holyness (which is the meanest imaginable) to be in capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of being admitted into the same covenant with their parents.</p>

                  <hi>The scope of the</hi> Apostle <hi>here, is to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a scruple of the</hi> Corinth. viz. <hi>whether the believing yoak-fellow might live in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and use of the unbelieving yoak-fellow? he resolves them in the affirmative, saying, The
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98780:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unbelieving husband is sanctifyed</hi> in (<hi>as 'tis in the</hi> Greek) <hi>or</hi> to (<hi>not</hi> for, <hi>or</hi> by) <hi>the wife, &amp;c. That is, he may lawfully use, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her, and she enjoy himâ€”and their Children holy, that is, legitimate.</hi>

               <p>But here is certainly some speciall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege set forth to the Children of believers accruing to them from the believing parents. Besides, it had been no news to tell them they might have the lawfull use of one another, and that their Children were legitimate, and no bastards.

               <p>To which he replyed, Nor <hi>Alexander</hi> ever saw such a knot, as the Gordian, which made him cut it, when he could not untie it; you teach me by experience to know that there is no disputing against them that deny all Principles; as where you think the people doe not understand, you make no scruple to deny clear truths in Logick, and Divinitie; Therefore I see I must goe to plain scriptures,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98780:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that all the people may understand the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities. Now that the Definition of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism (which was the thing denyed) belongs to Infants, I prove thus.</p>
               <p>If God institute Baptism for infants, Christ merited it for them, and they stand need of it, then to infants belongs the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Baptism; But God instituted, Christ meritted, and Infants stand need of Baptism; Therefore to infants belongs the Definition of Baptism.</p>

               <p>Which he promised to prove in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, First that God did institute Baptism for infants. He that appointed infants Church-members under the Gospell, did institute Baptism for them; But God appointed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Church-members under the Gospell; Therefore God did institute Baptism for infants.</p>

                  <hi>He said first the Major might be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, because, to be Church-members (whereas he should have said Church-members under

the Gospell) and to be Baptized, were not</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini convertibiles.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He confessed it, for infants under the Law were Church-members, and yet not Baptized, but Circumcised, and before the Law Church-members, and yet neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, nor Baptized; but under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell they were so convertible, that all that were Baptized, were Church-members, and all that were Church-members were to be Baptized, which is that which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed now, and is a truth, a truth so clear, that Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> confesses it all along in his Books, and upon that confessed ground, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> goes in many of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>That I'l confirm (sayes he) with a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold cord, which will not easily be broken, before the Law, under the Law, under the Gospell, which he framed into an Argument thus Those whom God did promise before the

Law, foretell under the Law, actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into covenant under the Gospell, those God did appoint Church-members under the Gospell; But God did promise before the Law, foretell under the Law, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally receive Infants into Covenant under the Gospell; Therefore God did appoint In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Church-members under the Gospell.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the Minor, That God did not promise before the Law, foretell under the Law, and actually receive infants into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under the Gospell.</hi>

               <p>Which was proved in order, first that God did promise before the Law that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants should be in covenant under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, thus.</p>
               <p>That which God did promise to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> was before the Law; But God did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that infants should be in covenant under the Gospell; Therefore God did promise before the Law, that infants should be in covenant under the Gospell. The Minor being denyed, he proved out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>I will establish my covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me, and thee, and thy seed after, thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant.
to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98780:23"/>
be a God unto thee, and unto thy seed after thee.</hi> Thus framing his Argument; He that makes an everlasting covenant to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his seed after him in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, promised that infants should be in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under the Gospell; but God makes an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seed after him in their generations; Therefore God promised that infants should be in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under the Gospell.</p>

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the Major, saying, that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting signifyed onely a long time, not that it should be so under the Gospell to the worlds end; and was to be interpreted by the verse following, I will give unto thee the Land of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan <hi>for an everlasting possession, and yet the</hi> Jews <hi>are now dispossessed of</hi> Canaan.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>They are now dispossest, but shall be possessed of it again at their conversion, and so have an everlasting possession, in the type to the end of the world, in the Antitype for ever, but that the covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> is to continue to the end of the World appears in that it is a Gospell covenant; That which is a Gospell cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is to continue to the end of the world;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98780:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But the covenant that God made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his seed to all generations, is a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. and the scripture foreseeing that God would Justifie the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, through faith, preached the Gospell before to <hi>Abraham,</hi> saying, <hi>In thee shall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be blessed</hi>; Therefore it is to continue to the end of the world.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Without repeating, he confusedly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd thus, that it was an everlasting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to continue to the end of the world, but not to infants.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He told him first that it was a denying of the Conclusion, then took away his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thus; If God command infants to stand before him, in covenant, then it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to infants; But God commands infants to stand in covenant before him; Therefore it is to continue to infants. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11. <hi>Yee stand this day all of you before the Lord, your God, your Captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of</hi> Israel, <hi>your litle ones.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>He said that he should have proved that it should continue to infants to the worlds end, for he did not deny but that infants in some
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98780:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sense were in covenant under the Law, but not under the Gospell.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes under the Gospell; If Christ hath obtained a more excellent Ministrie, and is a Mediator of a better covenant, which is established upon better promisses, then if infants were in covenant under the Law, they are in covenant under the Gospell; But <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. Christ hath obtained a more excellent Ministry, was a Mediator of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter covenant, which was established upon better promises; Therefore if infants were in covenant under the Law, they are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under the Gospell.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the consequence of the Major, that tho the covenant of the Gospell was a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter covenant than that of the Law, yet infants were not in covenant as well under the Gospell, as under the Law.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was thus taken away; That which unchurches the one half of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and leaves them no ordinary means of Salvation, can not be a better covenant; But to deny infants to be in covenant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churches the one half of Christendome, and leaves them no ordinary means of Salvation;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98780:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Therefore it cannot be a better covenant.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Without repeating the Syllogism, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying either of the Premisses, or formally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying any distinction, he said, the covenant under the Gospell was made onely with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall seed of</hi> Abraham.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was thus disproved; If the covenant was made in the same manner, and extent, to the Gentiles, as to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> then under the Gospell it was not onely made to the Spirituall seed; But it was made in the same manner, and extent, to the Gentiles, as it was to the <hi>Jewes</hi>; Therefore under the Gospell it was not onely made to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall seed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved by this Enthyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma: The partition wall is pulled down, and <hi>Jewe</hi> and Gentile are all one in Christ-Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus; Therefore the covenant is made in the same manner, and extent, to the <hi>Jew,</hi> and Gentile.</p>

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the consequent, that, tho the partition wall was taken down, and both</hi> Jew <hi>and Gentile are all one in Christ-Jesus, seeing the Gospell was offered to all nations;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98780:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet under the Gospell the covenant was onely with the Elect, and believers.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was confuted thus; That which is made with the whole visible Church, is not onely made with the Elect, and true believers; But the covenant is made with the whole visible Church; Therefore not onely with the Elect, and true believers.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved thus; That which is made to the kingdom of God upon earth, is not onely made to the Elect; But that which is made to the whole Church visible is made to the kingdom of God upon Earth; Therefore it was not onely made to the Elect.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved thus; In the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, that is in the Church Militant, there are not onely Elect, but reprobates, Saints, but hypocrites, for all that are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly called, are of the kingdom of God in this sense, and many are called, but few chosen, The kingdom of God is compared
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98780:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to a field, where there are tares, as well as wheat; a fould; where there are goats as well as sheep; to a noble mans house, where there are vessels of dishonour, as well as honour; And if the Church in regard of outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of ordinances (which is the Question) were onely the Elect, then it would follow that there were no visible Church upon earth, the <hi>Jewes</hi> had no more visible Church than the heathens, the dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inction of the Church visible, and invisible, were frivolous, for no man, nor angell, knows who are Elect, nor any but God.</p>
               <p>To which issue the first branch of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument being brought, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> referred the judgment of it to the people, And proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the second, that God foretold under the Law, that infants should be Church-members under the Gospell.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>perceiving that the people ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that he was brought to an apparent absurdity, would have waded into a large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to wind himself out.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>C.</hi> told him, that it was his office (being Respondent) to deny or dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inguish, but not authoritatively to determine
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98780:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the question, as if he were the Dr. of the chair; And with much ado (the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes crying let him have liberty to speak on) brought him to dispute again, and to turn to <hi>Esay.</hi> 49.22. Whence he framed this Argument. He that foretold that he would lift up his hand to the Gentiles, and set up a standard to the people, and that they should bring their sons in their Armes, and their daughters shall be carryed upon their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, foretold that infants should be Church-members under the Gospell; But thus saith the Lord God, Behold I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people, and they shall bring thy sons in their Arms, and thy daughters shall be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed upon their shoulders; Therefore God foretold that infants should be Church-members under the Gospell.</p>

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the Major; And said the meaning was, that the</hi> Jewes <hi>should bring the Gentiles children.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>To which he replyed, God sayes I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and they, that is the Gentiles, shall bring thy sons, and Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> says the <hi>Jews</hi> shall bring thy
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98780:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Mr.</hi> T. <hi>recollecting himself said, the meaning was, the Gentiles should bring the</hi> Jewes <hi>children from captivity; And that it did not point at the time of the Gospell.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>To which was replyed, the contents of the Chapter sayes that it points at the time of the Gospell; Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> sayes it points at the time of the <hi>Jewes</hi> captivitie, whether shall we believe? and repeated the contents: Christ being sent to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> complaineth of them to the 5. <hi>verse,</hi> he is sent to the Gentiles to the 13. <hi>verse,</hi> Gods love to his Church to the end; then the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple laughed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The pith of which was framed into an argument thus; That which is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of England ought to be entertained before the groundles assertion of one private man; But that it points at the time of the Gospell is the judgment of the Church of England; Therefore it ought to be entertained before the groundles assertion of one private man.</p>

               <p>Which was thus proved, If the Church of <hi>England</hi> causes it to be printed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it to be read before the Chapter, then it is the judgment of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; But the Church of <hi>England</hi> causes it to be printed, and commands it to be read before the Chapter; Therefore it is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

Chapter from <hi>verse</hi> to <hi>verse.</hi> Mr. <hi>C.</hi> told him, that they came not to hear him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, but dispute, and repeating the last Argument, wished him to answer; at which <hi>Abbets</hi> stood up again, and said the words of the text were, that they, that is, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, shall bring thy Children, that is the <hi>Jewes.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> replyed, that was an addition to the text, for there is no mention of the <hi>Jewes</hi>; But grant it were, must it be therefore meant of the Captivitie? the 20. and 21. <hi>verses</hi> of this Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes it, intimating that the <hi>Jewes</hi> after Christs comming shall lose their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and the Gentiles Children shall be adopted, and engrafted into their place; They, that is the Gentiles converted, shall bring thy sons, thine by a kind of adoption, and spirituall succession, for the Gentiles Children were ingrafted into the stock of the <hi>Jewes</hi> Children broke off; And this is so clear from the Context (compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.) That with reason it could not be denyed; But he was to speak to Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> who understood the nature of a dispute, and not to him, and if he would take upon him
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98780:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Moderat, it was fit that he should have another.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Tombs <hi>asked Mr.</hi> C. <hi>what he understood by standart, what by kings, what by nursing Fathers, &amp;c.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He told him, that it was not his place to dispute Socratically by asking of questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but to answer <hi>ad Appositum.</hi> But to give him Satisfaction (which he needed not) by Standart he understood some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Gospell ordinance, as Baptism; by Kings supream Magistrats, by nursing Fathers, and nursing Mothers, patrons, and protectours of the Gospell.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He said that it was a Metaphoricall speech, and that nothing could be gathered from it.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He replyed, that he would grant him that it was more than a Metaphoricall speech, (for a Metaphor consisted but in one single trope) but it was a continuation of severall tropes, and therefore Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; yet it does not follow, that nothing could be gathered from it, for then nothing could be gathered from any Parable in the Gospell; Nay nor any part of the New testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98780:29"/>
for there is scarce a sentence without some Tropes in it.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>said it was fulfilled in</hi> Hesters <hi>time, which was a nursing Mother to the</hi> Jews:</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>To which was answered; <hi>Hester</hi> was a <hi>Jew,</hi> and a friend to the <hi>Jews,</hi> what is this to the Gentiles bringing Children upon Shoulders? And tho that should be waved, and <hi>Hester</hi> granted to be a nursing Mother in the type, yet in the Antitype it aymes principally at the times of the Gospell, else grosse absurdities would follow; for what Kings, or Queens in <hi>Hesters</hi>-time did bow down to the <hi>Jews</hi> with their face towards the Earth, and lick up the dust of their feet? <hi>verse</hi> 23. Iles are summoned in the first <hi>verse,</hi> which must be meant of the time of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: Christ is promised to be given for a light for the Gentiles, that he may be their Salvation to the end of the earth. 6. Kings shall see, and arise, Princes also shall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships. 7. And the holy Ghost, quotes <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim,</hi> and applyes to the time of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the 8. <hi>verse,</hi> and that expressely 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. There is an implyed cutting off to the <hi>Jews,</hi> 20. An ingrafting in of the Gentiles,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98780:29"/>
the Children of the wild olive into the stock of the naturall olive, 21. And a Bringing of Children to visible ordinances, 22. All which he offered to frame into Arguments.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But Mr.</hi> T. <hi>prevented it, saying, that though it should be understood of the times of the Gospell, yet by sons in Armes, and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon Shoulders, was meant grown men, for any thing he knew, and men women and of a hundred years of age might be carryed upon armes, and upon shoulders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which indeed is the same answer Mr.</hi> T. <hi>gives in his scepticall exercitation; (like foxes, and badgers being beat out of one hole, hath another to fly unto:) Where (as Mr.</hi> Hussey <hi>quotes him) he uses the same words, that Mr.</hi> Abbets, <hi>and he found fault with in Mr.</hi> C. <hi>Major proposition, for these are his words, It is foretold that Gentiles should bring their Children in their armes, therefore the Prophet foresaw the Baptism of Infants; he might have seen the beam in his own eye,</hi> turpe est doctori, &amp;c. <hi>But to return to Mr.</hi> T. <hi>answer.</hi>

               <p>Which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> took thus away; Them
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98780:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they should bring in their bosomes were Infants; But it was foretold that they should bring them in their bosomes; Therefore they were Infants.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He enquired where it did appear that they should bring them in their bosomes.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Out of the text, for the word in the originall (which is translated armes) is bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and so the Septuagints read it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, intimating that they should bring sucking Children hanging upon their breasts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Mr.</hi> Tombs <hi>said it was an ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, and performed when the Gentiles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded their Children to embrace Christ.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, it is their Children, not thy children, <hi>oportet esse memorem</hi>; But not that neither; for that Scripture which in the letter suites with many other Scriptures, but in the pretended analogie with no other, can not be the meaning; But to interpret it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally of bringing Children to Christ in the bosome, suites with many scriptures, and to perswade them to come to Christ, with no scriptures; Therefore it can not be the meaning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>could not name one text of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98780:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where to bring in armes, or bosome, was to perswade to come to Christ.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>So Mr. <hi>C.</hi> referred the judgment of it to the people, and named another text, <hi>Es.</hi> 65.20. <hi>There shall be no more thence an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant of dayes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the child shall die an hundred year old.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Tombs <hi>bid him read the rest of the words, and the verse following.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He said he had read as much as he intended to rayse his Argument from.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take notice (sayes he) he will not read that which makes against him.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Not so; for nothing of it makes against me, but that an Argument must be <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus simplex,</hi> and <hi>homogeneal,</hi> and that you know well inough, but that in place of solid Satisfaction you must say something to deceive the people. The Arguments I raise hence are two, the first is this, There shall be no more an Infant of dayes, that is, Infants shall not be uncapable of the seal, while their age is measured by dayes, as the <hi>Jews</hi> Infants that might not be Circumcised till a week had passed over them; Therefore Infants new born are capable of the seal; The
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98780:31"/>
secund Argument is this, The child shall dye an hundred year old, that is, as an hundred year old, or as well a Church-member as if he were a hundred year old; Therefore Children may be Baptized under the Gospell:</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr:</hi> T. <hi>found fault with that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, shall dye an hundred years old, that is as if an hundred years old.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He answered, to take it literally would imply a contradiction, for it was impossible to be a child, and a hundred years old, and was better than his, and the Anabaptistes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. they were <hi>Baptized under the cloud,</hi> that is (say you) as if they were Baptized under the cloud, when nothing hindred, but they were really Baptized under the cloud. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.19. the <hi>branches were broken off</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that is (say you) as if they were broken off, when it was both possible, and apparent, that they were broken off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Mr.</hi> T. <hi>said it was not meant of the times of the Gospell.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>To which was replyed; Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will still be wiser than the Church of England; and read the Contents of the Chapter; The calling of the Gentiles <hi>v.</hi> 1. the <hi>Jews</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98780:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr:</hi> T. <hi>said it was verifyed</hi> Zacha: 8.4. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, there shall yet old men, and old women dwell in the streets of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and every man with his staff in his hand for very age, and the streets of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie shall be full of boyes, and girles playing in the streets thereof.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>To which was replyed; what is this to an Infant of dayes, or a child dying a hundred years old? when it is apparent both from the Contents, &amp; Text, that this of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is meant of the <hi>Jews</hi> return from Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; more apparent that that of <hi>Es.</hi> is meant of the state of Christs kingdome under the Gospell which I prove thus; That Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that brings with it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Absurditie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, blasphemie, is not to be admitted; But to interpret it of the <hi>Jews</hi> return from Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie brings with it absurditie, untruth, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie; Therefore it is not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Tombs <hi>denyed the Minor.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved in order; first that it brought with it absurdity, To apply the 25. <hi>verse</hi> to the return from Captivity was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98780:32"/>
absurd, that the wolf and the lamb should feed together, and the Lion should eat straw with the bullock, and dust should be the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents meat; Therefore it brought with it absurdity. Secondly that it brought with it untruth; But to apply the 19. <hi>v.</hi> to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from Captivity brought with it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, that the voice of weeping should be no more heard in <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; for it was twice destroyed after, once by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> then by <hi>Vespatian,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>; Therefore it brought with it an untruth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that it brought with it blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; for to interpret the 17. <hi>verse,</hi> (Behold I create new heavens, and new earth, and the former shall no more be remembred, and come into mind) of the second temple, is blasphemous; Therefore it brought with it blasphemie, for it crosseth St. <hi>Peters</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. Wee according to his promise look for new heavens, and a new Earth; For can any rationall man think, that the new temple built at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his time, was this new heaven, and new earth, that the former should be no more remembred? When the antient men are said to weep, because the glory of the latter
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98780:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
temple was short of the glory of the first, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 3.12. [It was inferiour to <hi>Solomons</hi> temple, first in respect of the building, that was lower, and meaner; secondly, in respect of the vessels, before of Gold, now of brasse; thirdly, of five things that were lost, first the Ark of God, secondly, the <hi>Urim</hi> &amp; <hi>Thummim,</hi> thirdty, fire from Heaven to consume the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, fourthly, the glory of God between the Cherubims, fiftly, the gift of prophesie, for after the second temple there was no prophet.]</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>fell to his wonted course of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent exposition, wherein Mr.</hi> C. <hi>told him he violated the rules of dispute, and did lasciviously wanton it out into a wilderness of words, that the truth might be obscured or lost, and like a lapwing carry the hearers far from the matter. Then</hi> C. P. <hi>an Apothecary began to interpose, as he had done once before, till a gentleman of authoritie, told him, that it was not fit for a man of his place, and calling, to speak; Yet Mr.</hi> Tombs <hi>would not be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed, but went on saying that Dr.</hi> Prideaux <hi>in</hi> Oxford, <hi>when a place of Scripture was ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was wont to give a large exposition.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. C.</hi> Replyed; that <hi>Dr. Prideaux</hi> was Doctor of the Chair, and Judge of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and might do that which a Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent may not do, whose office is onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, deny, distinguish, and when a Text is quoted, to give a brief exposition, that the Opponent may have something to fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And what Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> did, he knew not; but what Dr. <hi>Collins,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> did, he could tell him; but that it was not to the present purpose. And that his judgment in this, was but the same with his own Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> as he knew of late by a sad experiment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. Tombes <hi>Asked what that was</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He told him an explosion, not for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability (for his dispute was plausible inough) but that he would neither be satisfied with D. <hi>Salvage</hi> his answer, nor the Doctor of the Chaires determination; but fell to repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and extravagances, as now.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tombes</hi> launched into a tedious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to vindicate himself, till he had tyred the Auditors, who cryed out this is but to waste time; And a learned Gentleman spake
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98780:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aloud, this is but to spend the time in parling, that he may avoid the gun-shot, for he is affraid the great thunderbolt is behind: and so with much adoe, he was brought to dispute again, where Mr. <hi>C.</hi> falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the third branch of his Argument, That God did actually receive Infants to be Church-members under the Gospell, began thus.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Those whom Christ commanded his disciples to Baptize, they may be Baptized; But Christ commanded his Disciples to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize Infants; Therefore they may be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. The Minor being denyed, was proved thus; He that commanded his Disciples to baptize all Nations, commanded them to Baptize Infants; But Christ commanded his Disciples; <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. to Baptize all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Therefore Christ commanded them to Baptize Infants.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved by this Enthyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; The whole includes every part; Infants are a part of Nations; Therfore he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Baptize all Nations, commanded to Baptize Infants.</p>

                  <hi>He denyed the consequent, though the whole included every part, and Nations were the whole, and Infants were a part of Nations, yet it did not follow that Infants were to be Baptized.</hi>

               <p>He returned, that, that saying of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas (posito toto generali, pars ejus negari non potest,</hi> a generall whole being granted, no part of it can be denyed) was an axiome both in Logick, Philosophie, and Divinity, as <hi>Psalm</hi> 117.1. <hi>Prayse the Lord all yee Nations,</hi> is interpreted by another Psalm, <hi>Old men, and babes, young men, and maidens, prayse yee the Lord.</hi>

               <p>Mr. T. <hi>Said it was an Axiome that the whole includes every part, where there is no exception, but here is an exception.</hi>

               <p>Then said <hi>Mr. C.</hi> whether we shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey <hi>Ambrose</hi> Bishop of <hi>Millain</hi> with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98780:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or <hi>Mr. Tombes</hi> Vicar of <hi>Lemster</hi> against Scripture, judge you. But that there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception thus I prove, If Infants be excepted from Baptism, it is either because they are not named in the text, or because we find no instance that any were Baptized, or because they are not capable; But for none of these three; Therefore Infants are not excepted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>T. Denyed the Major, and said that a fourth reason might be given, because they were not Disciples,</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He told him that in this answer he shewed himself to be no good Logician; for it is an Axiome, that in no division, one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can be affirmed of another, because they are opposite, now to be Disciples, and capable of Baptism were not opposite but subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; And to be Disciples, if it made them not capable, it was no exception at all, if it made them capable, it was the same with the third, to which <hi>Dilemma</hi> when he could receive no answer, he demanded where it was required that those that are to be Baptized, must be Disciples?</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He replyed; at <hi>Ross</hi> you found fault with me for that translation, asking me, was I wiser than the translators? and now when it seemes to make for you, you urge it. <hi>Quo teneam vultus mutantem Protea nodo?</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, Baptizing, or by Baptizing in the present tense; as if Discipling were the end, and Baptizing the means, and required no qualification before (as learned men with great probability press) but I will not insist upon that now, But that which you denyed, I prove, that Infants may be Disciples, from [that place <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.10. compared with the 5. <hi>verse,</hi> for so <hi>Mr. C.</hi> said, mistaking it for] <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He replyed, he was in hast, and did not think of this before, but that his answer did drive him to it, and he in his elaborate books did oftentimes quote one place for another, then how much more might he, that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporall, it had been enough to have said, as our Saviour to the Tempter, <hi>its written</hi>: but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98780:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to leave these catches, and come to the proof. They upon whom the Pharasies would have layd the yoak, were Disciples, <hi>verse</hi> 10. Why tempt ye God, to put a yoak upon the neck of the Disciples; But many of them were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; Therefore Infants are Disciples.</p>

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the Minor, that many of them were not Infants.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved thus; The yoak was Circumcision <hi>verse</hi> 5. the Pharasies saying, that it was needfull to Circumcise them; But they upon whom the yoak was to be imposed by Circumcision, were only Infants amongst the Jews, and Infants together with Parents amongst the Gentiles; Therefore many of them were Infants.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the Major, and said the yoak was not Circumcision.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He replyed it was apparent, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the 5. and 10. with the foregoing <hi>verses.</hi> 1. <hi>verse</hi> Certain men came down from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and taught the brethren, except ye be Circumcised, after the manner of <hi>Moses,</hi> ye cannot be saved; where observe that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision is the subject of the Question. In the 2. <hi>verse</hi> they determined that <hi>Paul,</hi> and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98780:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and certain others of them, should go up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> unto the Apostles, and Elders, about this Question, to wit Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision. In the 5. certain of the Sect of the Pharasies said, that it was needfull to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise them. In the 6. the Apostles came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to consider of the matter, that is Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and when there had been much disputing, <hi>Peter</hi> rose up in the 7. and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the Question in the tenth <hi>verse,</hi> why tempt ye God to put a yoak upon the neck of the Disciples?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. T. Said, that Circumcision could not be the yoak, that neither they nor their fathers could bear.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He returned, that it was a bloody, and a heavy yoak, therefore the <hi>Israelites</hi> had a dispensation for 40. years in the wilderness; <hi>Moses</hi> neglected the Circumcision of his child probably for this cause; and his wife (when the Child was Circumcised) called him a bloody husband. The <hi>Sichemites</hi> were slain, as unable to defend themselves, while they were sore of the wound of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>T. Said, that the Doctrine of Moses
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98780:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was the yoak of which Infants were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He replyed; that Circumcision was principally meant, and the doctrine of <hi>Moses</hi> onely as an Appendix of it, and children were as capable of the doctrine then, as they were in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> his time, when all in the moment of Circumcision were tyed to the observation of the doctrine, tho they of ripe years (to use <hi>Vossius</hi> his distinction) were taught the doctrine <hi>antecedenter,</hi> before Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, infants of eight days <hi>consequenter,</hi> after Circumcision, when age made them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; I know (sayes God) <hi>Abraham</hi> will teach his Children; So it is apparent all those upon whom Circumcision with the doctrine of <hi>Moses</hi> was to be imposed, were called Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; But some of these were Infants, for onely Infants were Circumcised among the Jews, and Infants with the Parents among the Gentils; therefore some Infants are Disciples.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. T.</speaker>
               <p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But he pressed him to keep within the lists, urging this Argument. They to whom
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98780:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is the promise, they may be Baptized, its the Apostles own inference, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.28. Be Baptized, for the promise is to you; But to Infants of believing parents is the promise, the promise is to you, and your Children; therefore Infants may be Baptized.</p>

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the Minor, that to Infants of believing parents is the promise.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He told him, it was the words of the text, The promise is to you, and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> Mr. T. <hi>Said they were not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers yet.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. C.</hi> Replyed, they were believers <hi>in fieri,</hi> tho perhaps not <hi>in facto.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>That's Latine (sayes</hi> Mr. T.) <hi>what do you understand by it?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He said, I mean this, they were belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers by outward assent, and disposition, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make them members visible; but perhaps not believers by inward assent, and habit, to justify them. For I know you will not say that none are to be Baptized but they that have a saving faith, which none but God is able to discern. Ministers must act according to rule, which in <hi>adultis,</hi> is outward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98780:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or a willingness to receive the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and that they were thus qualified (which is sufficient) it is apparent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. T. <hi>Denyed that they were sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved thus; They whom the Apostle commanded to be Baptized, were sufficiently qualified; But the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be Baptized; Therefore they were sufficiently qualified.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> Mr. T. <hi>Without repeating the Syllogism, or applying any distinction, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red where the Apostle commanded them to be Baptized.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He told him <hi>verse</hi> 38. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>

               <p>
                  <hi>Yes (sayes Mr.</hi> T.) <hi>Upon condition of Repentance, repent and be Baptized.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That is a condition of your own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and an adding to the Word of God, for where dos the Scripture, either expresly, or implyedly say, that Repentance is a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptism? if it be meant of compleat repentance, true it is, it was their duty both to repent, and to be Baptized, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in relation to crucifying of Christ, to be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98780:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Baptized in relation to Judaism, which they were to put off, and Christianity which they were to put on; But that they must have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat repentance before Baptism, it is not so much as hinted at. And if you mean incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat repentance (which is Indeed all that is required) they had that already, for they were pricked in conscience, saying, Men, and brethren what shall we do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. T. <hi>Said that was not all that was required, nor was it a sufficient qualification for Baptism.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Against which answer was concluded thus; That upon which the Apostles Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed three thousand the same day, was a sufficient qualification; But the Apostles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Baptized 3000. the same day; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a sufficient qualification.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the Minor, and gave his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the</hi> 40. <hi>and</hi> 41. verses, <hi>And with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other words did he testify, and exhort, saying, Save your selves from this untoward genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then they that gladly received the word were Baptized,</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It was replyed, that this was but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation, or reciting of the heads of <hi>Peters</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:98780:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sermon that he preached to them, before they were pricked in conscience, or were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to be baptized, and no new act; which was a thing usual in Scripture, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. God having expressed the creation of Man, and Gods blessing of him, and all creatures to him, by a <gap reason="foreign">

But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it made nothing against him, for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be taken thetically without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or hypothetically upon condition of repentance, the Children were to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed together with the Parents, <hi>the promise is to you and your Children,</hi> and that was all that he contended for; from whence ariseth this Argument, To whom the promise of Grace belongs, to them Baptism belongs also; But the promise of Grace belongs to Believers and their Children; Therefore Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism belongs to both.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He replyed, there were two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the text to overthrow that: The
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98780:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
first might be drawn from the Indicative predication in the present tense, the Promise is to you, and your Children, is, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as well to your Children, as to you. The second, from the opposition betwixt you and your Children, and them that are afar off. They, and their Children, which are, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>He replyed, there are many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in the text overthrows that; first, the word is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>said, it was also given to Men of ripe age.</hi>

               <p>Yes sometimes, by a figurative speech, (as that of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> to <hi>Brutus</hi> in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch) <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>The second circumstance in the text, is the substantive verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98780:40"/>
were all Old Men and Women that were present, and their Younger Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were absent.</p>
               <p>The third circumstance in the text is the <hi>finis cui,</hi> the end to whom the promise is, to you, and your Children; the Jews Children under the Law were in Covenant with their Parents, the Charter is confirm'd under the Gospel to them and their Children. The Jews when they crucified Christ, called for a Curse upon themselves, and upon their Children, here the Apostle gives them a Remedy as large as the Disease, <hi>the promise</hi> (that is, of Freedome from the curse) <hi>is to you and your Children.</hi>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and before they actually believe, which I prove thus: The blessing is as large as the curse; But the curse extended even to children, before they could actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (<hi>his blood be upon us and upon our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>) Therefore the blessing.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98780:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by blessing was meant the inward and spiritual part of the Covenant, it might be true; but that was nothing to the present purpose, seeing it was not known to us: But if the outward, and visible part, he denied that Infants were capable of the blessing, as well as liable to the curse.</hi>

               <p>Which distinction was took away thus: They that are holy with a Covenant-holiness are capable of the outward and visible part; But Infants of Believers are holy with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-holiness; Therefore they are capable of the outward and visible part.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> replyed, it was the language of learned men of all ages, amongst whom were <hi>Vossius, Bullinger,</hi> and <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi>; and that Children of Believing Parents were holy before Baptism, and that Baptism did not make, but declare them to be Christians.</p>

               <p>Well, you discover of what spirit you are, and your ignorance; Are not these the

words of the learned assembly of Divines in the Directory confirmed by Ordinance of Parliament? That Infants are Christians, and federally holy before Baptism, and therefore are they Baptized [<hi>Pag</hi> 12.] And that Infants of Believing Parents are thus holy, with a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derall, or Covenant-holiness, I thus prove from, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.

                  <hi>That sayes Mr. T. Is meant of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall holynes, or a lawfull use of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-bed, that they are no Bastards.</hi>

               <p>That Answer I thus infringe.

            </sp>

               <p>The proof lyes upon you, that it is not, yet Ile give give you one instance, or two, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. if the first fruits be holy, the Lump is also holy, and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>That is not meant of a Covenant-holyness.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, its as cleer as the light, and so you your self interpreted it at <hi>Ross,</hi> as there are hundreds that will witness, which was upon this occasion. I pressed that if the immediat parents were holy, the children were holy with a Covenant-holiness; you denyed the inference, and said the meaning of it was, that <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull was the first fruits, and root that was holy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his posterity was holy, and in covenant
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98780:42"/>
[And in this exposition, as he agreed with truth, so with <hi>Beza,</hi> who sayes that children are holy, that is comprehended in covenant from the wombe, and with <hi>Bowles</hi> who saith, that they are holy with outward holiness, by which they are judged to be in covenant]</p>
               <p>But to return from whence, by your retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have digressed. I am to prove that holyness is never taken in Scripture for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall cleanness in opposition to Illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Not in that place <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.2. the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seed have mingled themselves with the seed of those lands; which is either your on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or principall hold, (as far as I can gather out of your books) therefore in no place.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the Antecedent.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved thus. If it be meant of Matrimoniall cleanness, then this must be the meaning of the words; The holy seed, that is the lawfully begotten Jews, have mingled themselves with the seed of those lands, that is the bastards of those lands; But that cannot be the meaning, for happily there were some Bastards among the Jewes, and in that sense not holy, and no Bastards among the Nations, but all, or the most Legitimate,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98780:42"/>
and therefore in that sense not unholy; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not meant of Matrimoniall holiness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the Major, affirming that both Jews, and Nations, were holy before their mixture, but then, both they, and their Children became unclean, because God had forbidden them to marry with the Nations.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>To which was answered, they that are Saints are not unholy; But some Saints have been begot by this mixture, or unlawfull bed, as <hi>Jepthah,</hi> who <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. Is said to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by faith; Therefore they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the Major, saying, they may be unholy by their Naturall Generation, and first birth, and yet holy by Regeneration, and new birth.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This strikes not home; <hi>Moses</hi> had chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by his <hi>Ethiopian</hi> woman, but they were not illegitimate; therefore those that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got by mixture with the Nations were not Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. T. <hi>Said, that was before the Law was given.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Well, that Answer will do you little service; after the Law was given, <hi>Salomon</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:98780:43"/>
had children by <hi>Rahab,</hi> who was a <hi>Cananitish,</hi> and <hi>Boaz</hi> by <hi>Ruth,</hi> who was a <hi>Moabitish</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and yet they were not Illegitimate, or unholy, as you would have it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>They became Proselites, and received the Religion of the Jews.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, while they were not of the Jews Religion, tho no Bastards, they were unholy, when they embraced the Jews Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (by your own confession) they became holy; what is this but a Covenant-holyness which you have opposed all this while, and now grant it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. T. <hi>Used many words to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but with little satisfaction to the greatest part of the hearers, and still denied that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were holy, and in covenant.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was further proved thus, They that Christ took up in his arms, blessed, said, the Kingdom of God belonged unto them, pronounced a curse upon those that despised, and would not receive, are holy with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-holyness; But Christ took up little children into his arms, blessed them, sayd, the Kingdom of God belonged unto them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a curse upon those that despised, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98780:43"/>
would not receive them; Therefore little Children are holy with a Covenant-holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

                  <p>15. And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, &amp; Preach the Gospel to every Creature.</p>
                  <p>16. He that beleeveth, and is Baptized, shall be saved, but he that beleeveth not, shall be damned.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese two verses hold out the rich Charter of the Gospel, which our Saviour delivered to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles after his Resurrection; The parts are two, First a Precept, in the former verse, <hi>Go ye into all the world, and Preach the Gospel to every Creature</hi>; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Promise, with a Commination in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>He that beleeveth, and is Baptized, shall be saved; but he that beleeveth not, shall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Precept, we have two particulars, First a Mission, he sends them, <hi>Go ye into all
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98780:47"/>
the world</hi>; Secondly a Commission, he au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizes them, <hi>and Preach the Gospel to every Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the latter verse, or promise, we have First the thing promised, layd down affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively, <hi>shall be saved</hi>; Secondly the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, and that either absolute, <hi>he that beleveth,</hi> or conditional, <hi>and is Baptized; he that beleeveth, and is Baptized, shall be saved</hi>; Or a Commination <hi>shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> with a qualification negative, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely without any limitation, <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not, he that beleeveth not shall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Weel only hint at the former verse for introduction to the latter. <hi>And he said,</hi> (that is Christ,) Observe, that it is only God, Christ God and Man, that can give Mission, or Commission to Preach, and ordain Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Math.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given me in Heaven and Earth, Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations.</hi> Go ye into all the world, there is the largeness of their Commission, to all the world, as he, to all Nations as <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi> Hence observe, the Apostles, and by them the Evangelists, had an extraordinary
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98780:47"/>
Commission which extended through the world, but our Commission ordinarily is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to certain places; True it is, there may be itinerants upon special occasions, (and they also confined within their verges,) But as Doctor <hi>Buckeridge</hi> observes well when Christ speaks to Apostles, he says, <hi>Go ye into all the world,</hi> but when to ordinary Pastors, and Teachers <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> he fixed some to be Pastors, and some Teachers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Preach the Gospel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> there is the Commission, wherein we have First the Act <hi>Preach,</hi> that is proclame, Secondly the object of the Gospel, which in the Original, and other languages signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies good news, or a good speech; from the connexion between the Mission and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission comming from the same Authour Christ, and extended to the same persons, the Apostles, and their successours, observe, that none may Preach as Church Officers, but they that are sent in a Gospel way; our adversary in the common cause spoke so home to this, that we need not press it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The last thing is the extent of the Commission, and that a very large one, <hi>unto
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98780:48"/>
every Creature,</hi> as here, to all Nations, as <hi>Matthew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Quaere</hi> will be, what is meant by every Creature? Some limit it to every rational creature, Angels, men, Devils, as <hi>Origen,</hi> &amp; his <hi>misericordes Doctores</hi> who held the Devils and reprobates should be saved; but that cannot be; for 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>They are cast down to hell, and reserved to judgement.</hi> Some more strictly restrain it only to man, and that when he is come to age, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, excluding Children; this is too strict, True it is, Infants are not capable to be taught of men, but they may be taught of God; they cannot actually understand the Gospel, but they may actually receive the benefit of the Gospel; a noble mans Child hath interest in his Fathers Patent, and pardon; a sucking Infant (though he knows it not) may be joined in a lease with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Some extend it, and it is conceived more fitly according to the Letter, without any Synecdoche, or figure, to every creature, as if he should say, Go and proclame the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that comes by Christ to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for as by the first <hi>Adam</hi> all creatures
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98780:48"/>
were accursed, so by Christ the second <hi>Adam,</hi> all creatures shall be blessed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> every creature groans, desiring to be delivered into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, answerable to this, Preach the Gospel <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> to every creature, telling them, that they are now by Christ to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But the creature cannot hear, nor understand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Its true not properly, no more could <hi>John Baptist</hi> in his Mothers Womb, and yet <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the Babe sprang for joy; Nay the Holy Ghost ascribes a hearing to the creature, <hi>Hosea</hi> 2.21. <hi>And it shall come to pass in that day saith the Lord, I will hear the Heavens, and they shall hear the Earth, and the Earth shall hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl, and they shall hear</hi> Jezreel. Hence observe, that every creature in a sense is sensible of the benefit they have by Christ; but every one in their kind, men come to years, and discretion, are capable of actual understanding, actual profession, actual faith; Infants only in <hi>actu primo,</hi> are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98780:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the first seeds of understanding, of profession of Faith, which will shew it self in the fruits when they come to years; The rest of our fellow creatures as by a natural instinct they groan for the curse, so by an other instinct, they lift up their heads in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the blessing, and that <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Thus we have paraphrased upon the first verse for introduction to the second, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is First, a Consolatory promise, <hi>he that beleeveth, and is Baptized, shall be saved</hi>; Secondly a Comminatorie Curse, <hi>he that beleeveth not, shall be damned.</hi> In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, we have first the qualification, and that either absolute, <hi>he that beleeveth,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, <hi>and is Baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Now the <hi>Quaere</hi> will be, what belief is here meant?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> First the event tells us, that belief that saves us, <hi>he that believes shall be saved.</hi> Secondly the opposition, its contrary to that unbelief that damns; Observe that a saving Faith is necessary to salvation, without Faith
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98780:49"/>
it is impossible to please God, all they, and only they that have a saving Faith shall be saved; so that you see that Faith is a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and absolute condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And is Baptized,</hi> that is upon supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if Baptism conveniently may be had; hence observe, that Baptism is not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary by necessity of means (as they call it) as if none could be saved without it, but by necessity of Precept, if conveniently it may be had. The <hi>Israelites</hi> for forty years in the Wilderness were not Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised. <hi>Bernard,</hi> that saw not all things could see this, that, <hi>non absentia sed contemplus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenti damnat,</hi> not the want, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Sacrament damns: <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour dyed, as he was going to be Baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked what he thought of him, answered, that he was <hi>Baptizatus volo, &amp; voluntate, etiam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si non reverÃ  aquae lavacro,</hi> Baptized inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with wish, and will, though not outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the laver of water, <hi>Austin</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived here to be mistaken, who denyed salvation to Infants Un-Baptized, hence he is called <hi>durus Pater Infantum,</hi> a hard Father
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98780:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Infants; and many of the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hold that Infants that dye Un-Baptized, are kept in <hi>limbo Infantum</hi> in a Purgatory of Infants, where they shall never behold the beatifical vision.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But here is first placed beleeving, and then Baptized, so that from the order of placing the words, some would gather that we are first to beleeve before we be Baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That will not follow; for <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. There is placed first Baptizing, and then Preaching, and repentance after, whence they might as well gather that we must be Baptized, before we can hear the word Preached, or repent; Repentance in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is oft placed before Faith, and yet is a fruit, and effect of Faith; some of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists place <hi>Judas</hi> his receiving of the sop before the Sacrament, some after it; it is a rule in interpreting of holy Writ, that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura nescit prius, &amp; posterius,</hi> the Scripture does not alwaies observe the precise order in which things were done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But I beseech you consider what Faith it is that is here meant?</p>

               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:98780:50"/>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> A saving Faith; Must then a saving Faith be the rule of our Baptism? and must we Baptize none, but of those we know have a saving Faith; then we must Baptize none at all; never any Minister upon that ground had ever Commission to Baptize any, no not the Apostles, for they did not infallibly know that those they Baptized had a saving Faith; nay they actually Baptized many that were hypocrites, as <hi>Simon Magus, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Hymeneus, Philetus,</hi> and others; hence observe, That no rule for Baptizing in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral can be gathered out of this Text, And to say that none are to be Baptized, but they that have a saving Faith, which is the Faith that is only here meant, or none but they which make an outward profession of Faith (which is not here meant) is an untruth not gatherable from this Scripture, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of God, against which he hath proclamed a solemn curse.</p>
            <p>The Commination, or curse follows in the last words, <hi>He that beleeveth not, shall be damned</hi>; he does not say, he that is not Baptized shall be damned.</p>

yet a man may be saved without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; he does not say that he that is not dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped over head is damned, that is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, any washing in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is Baptism; he does not say, that he that is not Re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or Baptized again, is damned, for that is the invention of Man, never heard of (in that sense) before <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leydens</hi> time, who confessed at his execution, that he had that, and the rest of his poysoned Doctrine from Satan. Hence observe, That all unbelievers, though Baptised, shall be damned; men belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving though (through invincible necessity) Un-Baptized, shall be saved; thus we have given you the lively meaning of the Holy Ghost in the Text.</p>
            <p>Having layd this foundation, wee'l make further inquirie into two things which are in controversie, First what is meant by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, or Baptizing, Secondly whether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ought to be Baptized, or no.</p>
            <p>First, Baptism in the Original, signifies nothing but a washing, as <hi>Pareus</hi> upon the <hi>Hebrews</hi> says, <hi>Baptismus Graecis est quaevis ablutio,</hi> Baptism is in Greek any washing,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98780:51"/>
whether by dipping, or sprinkling, to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize is to dip, or sprinkle says, <hi>Ravenel</hi>; so says the Churches old Catechism dipped, or sprinkled in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; so the Directory, Baptize the Child, by powring, or sprinkling of the water on the face of the Child, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any further Ceremony. And as many kinds there are of washing, so many there are of Baptizing, whereof the Pillars of the Greek Tongue, <hi>Hesichius, Budeus, Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Scapula, Arius Montanus, Pasor,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion four; First <hi>tingere,</hi> to die, or tincture, Secondly <hi>mergere,</hi> to drown, or plunge, Thirdly <hi>madefacere,</hi> to wet, or moysten, and lastly <hi>abluere,</hi> to wash, or clense.</p>
            <p>I confess there are some that distinguish betwixt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> to rantise (as they call it) or sprinkle, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> which is to plunge to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> which is to swim upon the top, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, which is, as they criticise upon it, to swim betwixt the top, and bottom; these three last are mentioned by <hi>Casaubon</hi> in his notes upon the third Chapter of St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> as was quoted by our adversary, but with what fidelitie, or advantage to his cause, I
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98780:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
leave it to the Godly, and learned to Judge, for he left out the last words, wherein the whole state of the question is determined by <hi>Casaubon</hi> against him, for thus he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>horum sententia jampridem meritÃ² est explosa,</hi> &amp;c. the judgement of those men is deservedly long since exploded, and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down, that would have Baptizing to be by dipping, and he gives a reason, <hi>quum non in eo posita sit mysterii hujus vis, &amp;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, seeing the force, and efficacy of Baptism, this mysterie, consists not in that, that is the manner of washing. Which is confirmed by <hi>Aquinas, Immersio non est de necessitate Baptismi,</hi> dipping is not of the necessity of Baptism, And <hi>Dominico sotus, Ablutio est de essentiÃ¢ Baptismi,</hi> washing is of the essence of Baptism, but the manner of washing, whether by dipping, powring, or sprinkling, is accidental.</p>
            <p>Many places of Scripture confirm this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. there the <hi>Israelites</hi> were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the red Sea, when their feet did but touch the water, not as if they were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, when they were not (as the Ana bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists gloss upon this place) and that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:98780:52"/>
were really Baptized, for the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> were not Baptized in their sense, but sunk to the bottom like stones. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.5.</p>
            <p>Baptized under the Cloud, not that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> were Baptized, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> as if they were (as they descant) under the Cloud, for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were never under the Cloud, for the <hi>Israetites</hi> went before the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the Cloud, part of it was over the <hi>Israelites,</hi> part of it went before them.</p>
            <p>There is mention made in the Gospel of Baptizing, or washing of themselves when they came from Market, of Cups, of Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, of Tables, which cannot be meant of plunging, in water, so often, where that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement was so scarce, but rincing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Johns</hi> Baptizing in <hi>Jordan, Philips</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to the River with the <hi>Eunuch</hi> proves nothing at all; for what strange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence would this be, especially from the Anabaptists (that must have express Scripture for all things) <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in <hi>Jordan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> or to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> 
               <hi>Philip</hi> went down into the water with the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> therefore, they were dipped, seeing it might
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98780:53"/>
as well be by powring, or sprinkling of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon them, for any thing that appears out of the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. John</hi> Baptized in <hi>Enon,</hi> because there was much water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This will seem to be no wonder in those hot Countries, where there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles without a Spring of water, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seeing Geographers, and Travellers tells us, that <hi>Enon</hi> is a little Brook that one may stride over, scarce Knee deep, and therefore not capable of dipping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But Baptism, say they, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the death of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>We are buryed with him by Baptism,</hi> which is not by sprinkling, but dipping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, the scope of the place is to shew, that one end of our Baptism is to Seal our Communion with Christ in his death, but to press a necessity of resemblance by descending into the water, and comming out again, we see no ground in Text, and if our abiding under the water must answer Christs Burial in exact representation, then as Christ lay three days, and three nights in the Grave, so they must lye three days,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98780:53"/>
and three nights under the water, which if it were put in execution, the dispute would quickly be at an end.</p>
            <p>But should we grant this resemblance, I appeal to any man, whether our powring on of water in Baptism, does not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble our Christian Burial, which is by powring on of Earth, or Dust, than by plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging over head.</p>
            <p>Thus you see it proved, that Baptizing is any kind of washing, <hi>In the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost</hi>; we do not deny with Master <hi>Perkins,</hi> that if we were to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize converted Turks, or Pagans of ripe age, in hot Countries, we might Baptize them by dipping, Provided that their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not first Baptized, or washed, for that is conceived to be no less supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than Baptizing of Bells; Baptism (says <hi>Vossius) non est immersio vestium, sed huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Corporis,</hi> is not a washing of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but of the Body; we account the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Idolaters, for presenting that worship, First to the Image, which is terminated in Christ; the Garments are first washed, or dipped, and the Body but at the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98780:54"/>
most wet, or moystned through them.</p>
            <p>But to affirm that no Baptism but that which is by dipping is lawful, is a will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, much more, that Baptism otherwise is a nullitie, and those that are Baptized so, ought to be Baptized again, or Re-Baptized, which the Senate of <hi>Syrick</hi> understood well, when they made an Act, that all that did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to Re-Baptize such as were Baptized before, should be drowned.</p>
            <p>So we have resolved the former doubt, that Baptizing is not dipping, and come to the latter, that Infants may, nay ought to be Baptized. And (Brethren) I beseech you to give me leave a little to speak for Infants, those poor Souls, that cannot speak for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>And before we come to the Question, take with you these two Considerations; First, that those truths that were not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie in the Primitive times, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were not so punctual in pressing of them, seeing there was no need; <hi>Solon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked why he made no Law against murtherers of Parents, answer'd, because he conceiv'd none would commit that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98780:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Act; If the Apostles had been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, why they did not put down Infant-Baptism in plainer terms, I suppose they would have answered, that they thought none would have denyed it.</p>
            <p>Secondly observe, that those things that are pressed often in the old Testament, are mentioned more sparingly in the New, as the Sabbath, and Magistracy in the old Testament, line upon line, and precept up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on precept, but scarce a Syllable for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sabbath, or a Christian Magistracie in the new. Nothing is more clear then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Church-Membership in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, therefore not so clear in the New, and yet clear enough to those that have eyes to see it, as will appear by these reasons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Arg.</hi> First, those that are in Covenant with God, ought to have the Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is Baptism.</p>
            <p>But Infants of beleeving Parents are in Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>Therefore Infants ought to have the Seal of the Covenant, which is Baptism.</p>
            <p>The former Proposition is firm by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98780:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of all Divines, even our adversaries, <hi>Haec est fundamentalis ratio paedobaptismi</hi> (sayes <hi>Daneus)</hi> this is the fundamentall reason of Baptizing of Infants, that they are in Covenant, <hi>Esse foederatum suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ad accipiendum signum foederis,</hi> sayes <hi>Davenant,</hi> to be in Covenant is sufficient to receive the signe, and seal of the Covenant, <hi>Omnes foederati sunt Baptizandi,</hi> sayes <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> all that are in Covenant are to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, <hi>Si in foedere sunt, impiÃ¨ agunt, qui eis signum foederis negant,</hi> saith <hi>Ferus,</hi> if they be in Covenant, they do wickedly that deny them the signe of the Covenant; in a Civill contract (sayes Mr <hi>Perkins)</hi> the Father, and the heir make but one person, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's for himself and his posterity.</p>
            <p>The Minor proposition that Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents are in Covenant, is grounded on many Scriptures, <hi>Genes.</hi> 17.7. Where God establishes a Covenant, not only with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but with his seed after him in their generations, for an everlating Covenant, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting, and therefore to last to the end of the World; as <hi>Cornelius Ã  Lapide</hi> sayes, <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutÃ¨ aeternum est in semine spirituali fidelibus,</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:98780:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It is absolutely everlasting in the spirituall seed to the faithfull. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.8 The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture foreseeing that God would justifie the Heathen through faith, preached before the Gospel to <hi>Abraham</hi>; therefore if <hi>Isaac</hi> was in Covenant with his Father when he was but eight dayes old, and had the seal by vertue of the Lamb to be slain, much more the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believing Parents, by vertue of the Lamb that is already slain. <hi>Deutero.</hi> 29.11. When all the people stood in Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, their little ones are mentioned amongst the rest, which is further confirmed, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Be Baptized every one of you, for the promise is to you, and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>; to say that they were not yet believers, is but a shift, the Text makes it cleer, as soon as they were believers, their Children were in Covenant with them, and to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Such as were Circumcised under the Law, may be Baptized under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell.</p>
            <p>But Infants of believers were Circumcised under the Law. Therfore they may baptized under the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:98780:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Huic Argumento non omnes Anabaptistae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi> (sayes learned <hi>Whitaker</hi>) all the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists shall not be able to resist this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Minor, that Infants under the Law were Circumcised, is confessed.</p>
            <p>The former proposition is onely questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that Baptism under the Gospel to Infants, does not necessarily follow from Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion under the Law; <hi>Augustin</hi> is cleer for it, saying, <hi>Mutatis signis manet eadem gratia si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne aetatis discrimine,</hi> the outward visible signes being changed, the same grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines without any difference of age, and he gives a reason, because the grace of God is not straiter in the new Testament than in the old; Therefore Christ, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.6. Is said to be Mediator of a better Covenant, but how were it a better Covenant, if all poor Infants that were in Covenant under the Law, were out of Covenant under the Gospel? <hi>Titus.</hi> 2 12. <hi>The grace of God hath appeared unto all,</hi> and therefore surely to Infants; as <hi>Ireneus</hi> sayes, <hi>Christus pro parvulis parvulus factus est,</hi> Christ becam a little one, for little ones sake, that he might redeem the little ones. Little ones were the first Martyrs that suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98780:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for Christ, <hi>in Rama, was a voice heard</hi>; and that Baptism came in place of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Apostle cleares it, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Ye are circumcised with circumcision made without hands</hi>; How is that? <hi>Buryed with him in Baptism.</hi> Hence arises another Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Those that were once in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, had the Seal of the Covenant, and were never disfranchized, and put out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, have title to the Covenant, and Seal of it still.</p>
            <p>But Infants were once in Covenant, had the Seal of the Covenant, and were never disfranchized, and put out of Covenant, Therefore Infants have title to the covenant, and seal of it still.</p>
            <p>Let any man shew one syllable, one tittle in Scripture, that ever Infants were put out, and weel yield the gantlet; nay, the Gospell is so far from expressing of them that they are put out, that it gives them large commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations beyond them of riper years, making them the rule of our perfection, <hi>as new born babes, receive the sincere milk of the Word. Unless you be as little Children, ye shall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of God</hi>; which is a case
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98780:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so cleer, that even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him self en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>Nullum est impedimentum, &amp;c.</hi> there is nothing that hinders, but that Infants may as well be Baptized under the Gospell, as they were Circumcised under the Law; for neither hath God forbidden Ministers to give them this Sacrament, neither are they uncapable to receive it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. That which God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded may lafully be practised by the Ministers of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>But God hath, commanded Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
            <p>Therefore it may lawfully be practised by the Ministers of Jesus Christ. That God hath ommanded it, appears, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go Baptize all Nations</hi>; its a generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> sayes) <hi>posito generali mandato pars ejus negari non potest,</hi> a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall command being given, no part of it can be denyed; Infants are a part of Nations, and included in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But here is no mention made of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No, nor of them of age; we might retort it upon our adversaries, there is no
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98780:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mention made of <hi>Dippers,</hi> no, nor of them that are to be dipped, therefore they ought not to dip, nor be dipped. Generals include particulars in all Lawes; <hi>Psalm.</hi> 117. <hi>Praise the Lord all ye Nations,</hi> Nations includes old men, and babes, young men, and maids, all without exception, as another Psalm inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it.</p>
            <p>Now if Infants be excepted, contrary to that saying of Saint <hi>Ambrose, Qui dixit om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, nullum excepit, ne<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> parvulos, &amp;c.</hi> He that commanded all to be Baptized, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none, no, not little ones. If (I say) they be excepted, its either because they are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or because we never read in Scripture that any Infants were Baptized, or, because they are not capable; (that fourth cavill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same with the third, Ile take away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non) but for none of these three; therefore Infants are not excepted from Baptism.</p>
            <p>Not for the first, because they are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for so neither old men, nor nobles, nor Ministers are named. Not because we read not of their Baptism, so we neither read of the Baptism of the Apostles, nor of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> yet we piously believe that they were
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98780:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Baptized; <hi>De negatione facti ad jus non va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let consequentia,</hi> such a thing is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that it was done; therfore it was not done, or was not done, therefore it ought not to have been done, is no consequence; Christ did, and said many things that are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; so did his Apostles.</p>
            <p>Not for the third, because they are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, which is denyed; for if Infants be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable, it is either because they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and faith in act, which cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; Christ was Baptized, had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for he had no sin to repent of, had not faith, for faith presupposeth one lost in himself, that depends upon another for salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Christ is that Rock of Salvation, upon whom all mankind being lost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; Neither because they cannot hear the Word preached; then they that are born deaf should be excluded from Baptism; Or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not otherwise qualified; but that cannot hinder them, for God requires no more of them that are in Covenant, and born of believing Parents, but a pure capacity, and receptability, which Divines call <hi>Potentiam objectivam</hi>; as God in the beginning created
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98780:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the World of nothing, so in the beginning of the new creature he does regenerat, and recreate us of nothing; upon this account it is, that we read of many whole families Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, not excluding, but rather including Infants, <hi>Cornelius</hi> was Baptized with his houshold, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47, 48. <hi>Lydea,</hi> and her houshold, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15. <hi>Crispus,</hi> and all his house, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. and the houshold of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.16. the Jayler <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. They that are capable of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the blessing, which is the greater, are capable of Baptism, which is the lesser.</p>
            <p>But Infants are capable of the Kingdom, and the blessing, which is the greater.</p>
            <p>Therefore they are capable of Baptism which is the lesser; <hi>forbid not</hi> (sayes our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>little Children to come unto me, for unto such belongs the Kingdom of God</hi>; for surely, if the Kingdom of Heaven receive them, the Church may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them; for the Church must receive such as glory receives, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47. <hi>There were dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98780:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
added to the Church such as should be saved.</hi> Now for proof of this Argument, take these places, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.13. to 17. <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.14.36, 37. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.2, 3, 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.13, 14, 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.14, 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15, 16. Which tho they be spoken upon severall occasions, all prove Infants to be Church-members, and capable both of grace, and glory; weel instance in two, Jesus called a little child un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, the word is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which (as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> in his distinction of ages sayes, and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> seconds him,) signifies a child under seven years, and set him in the middest of them, and said, <hi>Verily I say unto you, except ye be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and become as little children,</hi> that is, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to be free from actuall sin, as they are, <hi>ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other is that of <hi>S. Luke</hi> 18.15. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in observe, First a Precept, <hi>Suffer little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to come unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we have a prohibition, <hi>and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, his displeasure against his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for hindring them from coming to him, he looked on this act with indignation, and was much displeased at it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:98780:59"/>Fourthly, he adds a reason why little ones should be brought to him, <hi>because to such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the Kingdom of God,</hi> that is, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of grace here, and glory hereafter; they are visible members of his Church, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and therefore none may hinder their access to him.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, he confirmes this reason, <hi>Ã  majori,</hi> from the greater to the less, Gods Kingdom doth not onely belong to them, but I tell you more, whosoever will come into this Kingdom, must resemble Infants in Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, humility, simplicity.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, he adds his benediction of them, <hi>he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them</hi>; and tells us <hi>that their Angels alwayes see the face of his Father, which is in Heaven</hi>; and the danger of them that offend one of these little ones; and all this recorded by three Evangelists, <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> as if it were of purpose to check the sacrilegious insolencie of these latter times that denyes them the seal. Christ is not more punctuall by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in declaring his own Birth, Passion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, than he is in this precious Truth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98780:60"/>
so much trampled under foot.</p>
            <p>And if any object, these were not young Children, the text easily confutes them, they were <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. Children under seven yeares of age, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Children that could scarce speak, they did not lead them, but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them unto him; Christ is said twice in S. <hi>Mark,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, to take them up in his armes, and embrace them; Christ was already instructing the people that were able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, the Apostles were offended for bringing of Children which could not understand.</p>
            <p>Well then, doth Christ take Children in his armes, and would he have them all put out of his visible Church? would he have us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them in his Name, and yet not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into his visible Church, nor as his Disciples? How can Infants be received in Christs Name, if they belong not visibly to him, and his Church? Nay, doth Christ ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a receiving of himself, and shall we then refuse to receive them, or acknowledge them the subjects of his visible Kingdom? will it not follow then that whosoever refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them, refuseth Christ, and him that sent him? For my part (to use the words of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98780:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and learned divine) Seeing the will of Christ is that I must walk by, and his word that I must be judged by, and he hath given me so full a discovery of his will in this point, I will boldly adventure to follow his rule, and had rather answer him upon his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for admitting an hundred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants into his Church, than answer for kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> 6. All Disciples may be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>But Infants of believing parents are Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>Therefore some Infants may be Baptized.</p>
            <p>The Major, or former proposition, is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our adversaries, who translate that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, go make Disciples of all Nations, which is in our last translation, <hi>Go teach all Nations,</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, as soon as they are Disciples they may be Baptized.</p>
            <p>Now for the Minor, that Infants are Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is evident from <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>Why, tempt yee God, and put a yoak upon the neck of the Disciples?</hi> this yoak was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and the attendants of it, as will
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98780:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
appear by comparing it with the fift verse, and the context from the beginning of the Chapter. Now among the Jews, children were only to be Circumcised, and amongst the Gentiles, children together with parents when they were converted, and became Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selites. To say that not only Circumcision, but the Doctrine, and Observation of the whole Law, by the yoak is meant, is but a shift; Circumcision was the Seal, or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by which the Jews were bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Doctrine, and the Law, and all those upon whom the yoak was layd by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, are called Disciples; whereof In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were a great part.</p>
            <p>And if it be objected, that children are not capable of instruction, as it is nothing to the purpose, so it contradicts Scripture, <hi>Esay</hi> 54.13. <hi>And all thy Children shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> And if any one carnally interpret this of the Jews return from captivity, as they do other places of <hi>Esa.</hi> our Saviour checks them, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. And <hi>It is written in the Prophets, And they shall all be taught of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. All that have faith may be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:98780:61"/>But some Infants have faith. Therefore some Infants may be Baptized.</p>
            <p>The proposition none will deny, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor may be proved by severall reasons.</p>
            <p>First, Christ expresly calls them Believers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. He attributes humility to them, and faith; and commands Elders to imitate them; and that you may see they were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.36. tells us they were such as Christ took up in His armes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they are said to receive the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. that is, the grace of God, Remission of sins, and life eternall; now the Kingdom is not received, but by faith in Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they please God, therfore Christ blesseth them; but without faith it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to please God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, either faith must be allowed them, or salvation denyed them; but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is cruell, and impious; therefore the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer must be godly, and pious; faith only purifies the heart, but no unclean thing shall enter into Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, tho Infants cannot make actuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith, yet they may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98780:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
roots of Sanctification, and faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Baptist</hi> and <hi>Jeremie</hi> were sanctified in their mothers wombs; let carnalists say what they will, that is the principal meaning of that place, <hi>Esay</hi> 65.20. <hi>There shall be no more an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant of days</hi>; The Jews thought they were not sanctified, unless a Sabbath went over them; <hi>the child shall dy an hundred year old,</hi> that is, as well in Covenant with God, or a visible Church-member, as if he were a hundred years old. Therefore <hi>Pareus</hi> sayes, <hi>Infantes Ecclesiae etiam ante Baptismum censentur side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>; Infants of the Church, even before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, are judged faithfull. <hi>Hommius</hi> sayes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have faith, <hi>in semine,</hi> in the seed, tho not <hi>in messe,</hi> in the harvest; <hi>Beza</hi> sayes, they have faith <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, in power, tho not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, in operation. Faith (says <hi>Treleatius</hi>) is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Active which the Elder have by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Passive, and by imputation, which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have by vertue of the Covenant, and Divine promise. <hi>Pelagius</hi> asks <hi>Austin</hi> where he places infants Baptized? he answers, <hi>in numero credentium,</hi> in the number of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98780:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and addes, <hi>nec judicare ullo modo aliter audebis, si non vis esse apertÃ¨ haereticus,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may thou presume to judge otherwise, if thou wilt not be a plain Heretick. Weel conclude this with that of <hi>Vossius,</hi> As in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals, so in supernaturals we must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish these three things, power, habit, and act; there is the power of reasoning in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, the habit in men sleeping, but the act, and exercise, in them that are waking; the power answers the seed, the habit the tree, the act, and exercise, the fruit; the seed of Faith may be in Infants, the habit in men of age, but the act, and exercise, in them that work according to the habit.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Arg.</hi> Those that are Holy, with a Covenant-holiness, may be Baptized. But Infants of beleeving Parents are Holy with a Covenant-Holiness. Therefore Infants of beleeving Parents may be Baptized. For the former Proposition, <hi>foederatis competit signum foederis,</hi> (says <hi>Vossius</hi>) the sign of the Covenant belongs to them that are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; Holiness is twofold (says <hi>Bullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)</hi> either of Faith, or of the Covenant. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Ye have mingled the holy seed,</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:98780:63"/>
that is them in Covenant, <hi>with the Nations,</hi> that is them that are out of Covenant. Thus you see, that Covenant-holiness is no gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beridge, but grounded upon Scripture, and avouched by learned men: as shall more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear.</p>
            <p>The Minor, that Children of beleeving Parents are holy with a Covenant-holiness, is clear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Else your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were unclean,</hi> that is, not in Covenant, <hi>but now they are holy,</hi> that is, in Covenant, thus (besides the ancients) <hi>Sharpius,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> interpret it, and <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> himself, <hi>Non loquitur Apostolus de Sanctitate naturali,</hi> &amp;c. The Apostle (says he) speaks not of natural holiness, and inhering to the nature of Children, but of an holiness ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to them, that is, the holiness of the Covenant, for the Children of beleevers are comprehended in the Covenant of grace, and therefore accounted holy of God. To interpret it (as the gross Anabaptists do) that they are holy, that is, no Bastards, is a new holiness not heard of in Scripture, and as (Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> says) a Bastard exposition; and <hi>Pareus</hi> gives the reason, if the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98780:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of beleevers be therefore holy, because they are no Bastards, the Children of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans are as well holy, for they are also no Bastards. <hi>If the first-fruits be holy, the lump is holy, and if the root be holy, so are also the branches.</hi> Rom. 11.16. The first fruits and the root, that is the Parents; the lump, the branches, that is the Children, and poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. if the Jews were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and the Gentiles graffed into their place, it will follow, that if the Jews were broken off, Parents with Children, then the Gentiles shall be graffed in, Parent with Children.</p>
            <p>But the Jews were broken off Parents with Children. Therefore the Gentiles shall be graffed in, Parents with Children.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Arg.</hi> If Infants should be out of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under the Gospel, many dangerous absurdities would follow.</p>
            <p>First, Infants would be losers by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, and be put in a worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than the Jewish Infants were; they with the Parents were admitted to the Seal of the Covenant, which was Circumcision,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98780:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not Children with Parents to Baptism.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if Infants should be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant then, and not now, Grace would be larger under the Law, than under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there would be no difference betwixt the Child of a Christian, and of a Pagan, but all the Infants of Christians would be as vile as the Children of Turks, Tartars, or Cannibals.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they would be without God, without Christ, without hope in the world; not the Children of God, but of the Devil; would all be damned, for out of Covenant, and visible Church (ordinarily) there is no salvation.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Arg.</hi> Lastly, that which hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued since the Apostles times with blessed success, must needs be lawful.</p>
            <p>But Infant-Baptism hath continued with blessed success since the Apostles times.</p>
            <p>Therefore Infant Baptism is lawful.</p>
            <p>Weel begin with the first Centurie, or hundred years after Christ. <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Areopagite whom the Apostles converted at <hi>Athens,</hi> says, Holy men have received a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98780:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tradition from the Fathers, that is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, to Baptise Infants. <hi>Clemens</hi> (who is recorded by some of the antients to succeed <hi>Peter</hi> in his Ministry at <hi>Rome)</hi> says <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, Baptise your Infants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireneus</hi> (who lived in the second Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) says, <hi>Christus pro parvulis parvulus factus est,</hi> Christ became a little one for little ones sake, that little ones might be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> that lived in the begining of the third Century says, The Church received a tradition from the Apostles to Baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and gives a reason, because they are born in impurity of sin; nay <hi>Pelagius,</hi> a great Scholar, who lived in the latter end of this Century, though he denyed Original sin, yet confessed Infant-Baptism, for when they pressed him with this Argument, if Infants had not Original sin what need they Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, he answered, that Christ appointed, and the Church practised Infant-Baptism, not to purge sin by past, but to prevent it for the time to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the fourth Century confirms it in his Epistle to <hi>Fidus,</hi> and gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98780:65"/>
of a Council of sixty six Bishops that decreed that Infants should be Baptized. <hi>Ambrose</hi> says, because every age is lyable to sin, therefore every age is fit for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptism. <hi>Nazianzene</hi> says it is better to Seal Infants with Baptism, (though they know it not) then to leave them unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Austen</hi> is conceived to go too far, who denyed possibility of salvation to them that dyed un-baptized, pressing that place <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a Man be Born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Millevitan</hi> Counsel in the fifth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury decreed, That whosoever should deny that Infants, even taken from their Mothers wombs, might not be Baptized, should be accursed. All Churches, all ages since, agree in this; the Harmonies of confessions of all Reformed Churches, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the Apologie, the old Catechism, The twenty seventh Article, the Directory, the greater and lesser Catechism composed by the Assembly of Divines, the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a further Declaration, all confirm it; The Canons of our Church did not only in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98780:65"/>
former times declare, but the Lawes of our Land did punish <hi>Anabaptists</hi> as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. <hi>Mr. Fox</hi> in his <hi>Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> approves of the <hi>Albigenses, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses, Wickliffists, Lollards,</hi> Poor men of <hi>Lyons, Brownists, Barrowists,</hi> as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Reformed Churches, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excludes the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> as erring funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally.</p>
            <p>I'le say no more for confirmation of this polemicall discourse, but wind up all with a word of exhortation; I beseech you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren consider what a dangerous errour this is, that robbs the Scripture of its truth, Infants of their right, parents of their comforts, the Church of its members, Christ of his merits, God of his glory; That is the mother of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other errours; hence sprung the <hi>Ranters, Socinians, Antitrinitarians, Shakers, Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> they that are above Ordinances, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripturians</hi>; An errour that God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed many signall judgments against, as <hi>Sleiden</hi> and <hi>Gastius</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and some of our worthies in <hi>England</hi> have declared. As reverend <hi>Mr. Cotton</hi> tells one of his Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98780:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
children in it, No wonder that fire seised upon his house, and God denyed water to quench it, who denyed that water should be brought to Baptize his Infants.</p>
            <p>Secondly, consider that much benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds both to parents, and children, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptism.</p>
            <p>First, much comfort comes hereby to the parents, when they consider Gods free grace to them, and theirs, that <hi>he is not ashamed to be called their God, and the God of their seed after them. Hebr.</hi> 11.16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, much benefit comes to Infants by Baptism, (which the Devill knowes well, when he causes witches to renounce their Baptism, when they enter into Covenant with him) for they are thereby admitted into the bosome of the Church, devoted, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated unto God, his Name is put upon them, they wear his Royall badge, and by it they are distinguished from <hi>Heathens.</hi> And this so clear from Scriptures, truly, and spiritually understood, <hi>That the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the God of Peace and Truth, by his Spirit, lead us into all truth, keep us pure, and
