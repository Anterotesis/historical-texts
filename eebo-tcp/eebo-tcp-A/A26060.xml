            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DEFENCE OF THE <hi>Country Parſon's</hi> ADMONITION.</head>
            <p>THere is a Paper called <hi>The Plain Man's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> &amp;c. Which hath made ſome Reflections upon <hi>The Country Parſon's</hi> Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But how juſtly and with what ſucceſs (being directed <hi>to make ſhort work on't)</hi> I do thus <hi>briefly</hi> examine.</p>
            <p>The exceptions againſt that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35275:3"/>
little Tract, are 1. <hi>General. 2. Special.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>general</hi> exception is againſt the Perſon who gives you this Advice. Who, as he pretends, is not duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to write Admonitions, becauſe he is not Infallible. For thus he expoſtulates with me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, You do not pretend to ſuch Infallibility; and therefore if I muſt rely upon the Miniſterial Function, I ought in caſe it can be found, to ſeek out ſuch a one as is unerring.</hi> (Plain Man's Anſwer, p. 3.) And again. <hi>But what! muſt I ſtand to the Direction of the Miniſterial Function? Can it ſecure me that the Reverend Divines of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35275:3"/>
Church of</hi> England <hi>have hit upon the right ſence of Scripture? But I ſee they pretend not to ſuch an Infallibility. And therefore Sir, I muſt needs tell you, that as when I make choice of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian or Lawyer, I love to chuſe the beſt. So, if I muſt make choice of a Director, I muſt and will make choice of him, that can give me ſecurity that he neither</hi> can <hi>nor</hi> will <hi>lead me aſtray; for I do not love to rely upon any thing that can deceive me.</hi> [p. 5.]</p>
            <p>The ſum of which charge, when reſolved into plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe Divines of the Church of</hi> England (are ſo modeſt) <hi>they dare not pretend to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> (for they know but in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35275:4"/>
part, 1 Cor. 13. 12.) <hi>and therefore they are not fit to be truſted with the care of Souls. Do not hearken to them, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their Admonitions. But the Prieſts of the Church of</hi> Rome (if we could but make you believe it) <hi>they are Infallible,</hi> i. e. <hi>they neither</hi> can <hi>nor</hi> will <hi>deceive you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But are theſe Miſſioners in earneſt whilſt they inſinuate ſuch Things? Do they really believe themſelves when they talk at this rate? To put them to the Teſt;</p>
            <p>Ask this very Miſſioner; whether <hi>He,</hi> or any other <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Prieſt in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is Infallible? And let him not think to ſatisfy your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35275:4"/>
doubts by declaring; <hi>That he doth not find any other, but thoſe called</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks, that offer to challenge it.</hi> (pag. 2.) Whats this to the purpoſe? We need not be told that they challenge to be infallible; We do not ſuſpect their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but expect their proof.</p>
            <p>But now if this Miſſioner ſhall acknowledge, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>he</hi> nor any other private Prieſt is infallible (and I know he dares not pretend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) you are then to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, from his own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that ſuch fallible and erring Guides are not fit to be truſted.</p>
            <p>You have lately been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, <hi>not to pin your faith
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35275:5"/>
upon anothers ſleeve, unleſs you could be ſure that ſuch a one on whom you rely,</hi> could not, <hi>nor</hi> would not <hi>deceive you.</hi> (p. 3.) And therefore <hi>(my good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners)</hi> ſince ſome body muſt direct you, pray do you conſider; whether it is not more prudent to truſt your own Parſon, then a fallible pretending Prieſt?</p>
            <p>If this Miſſioner ſhall then further propoſe; that though he is not infallible himſelf, yet he can bring you to an <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church,</hi> and that's as <hi>good.</hi> To this you may Anſwer; That though your Parſon is not infallible, yet he can bring you to <hi>infallible Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and that's <hi>better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35275:5"/>
And 'tis pertinent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; that the Romaniſts themſelves, as well as <hi>we,</hi> do acknowledg theſe Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be infallible; But we Proteſtants do declare; That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not infallible. And therefore, ſince in all doubtful Caſes the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt part is to be choſen (and that's ſafeſt, ſay the Prieſts, wherein both ſides are agreed) do you ſtick to the Scriptures, and let them take their Church.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not now enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Merits of the Cauſe; by examining the nature of this pretended <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Neither, at preſent, ſhall I take notice of thoſe Reaſons, which are here produced by this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35275:6"/>
               <hi>Miſſioner</hi> to ſupport it. Theſe, God willing, ſhall be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their proper place, <hi>viz.</hi> in my <hi>Reflections upon the Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners Anſwer to the Plain-man's Reply.</hi> Which I hope, in due time, to publiſh.</p>
            <p>So much for his <hi>General</hi> Exception.</p>
            <p>His Exceptions in <hi>Special,</hi> are againſt thoſe Directions, which by way of expedient, I deſired you to obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is not well pleaſed that I ſend you to your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>To Pray unto God to give you his Grace; to hold faſt the Profeſſion of your Faith without wavering,</hi> Heb. 10. 23.</p>
            <p>But this is to correct St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and not the <hi>Country-Parſon.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:35275:6"/>
Who thinks it very proper (ſince we are to pray in Faith) to turn an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Precept into a Prayer. And being admoniſhed by the Apoſtle to <hi>hold faſt our Profeſſion:</hi> in an humble dependance upon the divine Grace, we pray unto God to enable us to do it.</p>
            <p>However at laſt he gives you leave to ſay your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But then he tells you, it muſt be in this Form. <hi>If I be not in the right,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>If I be in the right,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But will this Miſſioner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his new Converts, to pray with theſe <hi>If's</hi> and <hi>And's?</hi> If he grants them ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let me then deſire them daily to repeat this Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:35275:7"/>
               <hi>If the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>of which I have now profeſſed my ſelf a Member, is not a ſound Catholick Church; but in any inſtance is erroneous Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Idolatrous; Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my Errors, and lead me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of Truth. And if the Reformation of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>is juſt and waranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and agreeable to thy Holy Word; Lord open mine Eyes; that I may acknowledge my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake and return into her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>If here it ſhall be further urged; That this conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way of praying is indeed very fit for Proteſtants, who are not <hi>infallibly</hi> ſecure that their Faith is true, being
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35275:7"/>
               <hi>various</hi> and <hi>uncertain;</hi> [p. 3.]</p>
            <p>But theſe kind of Prayer are never to be uſed by Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks, who are certain that their Faith is true; and that they are in the right, as being Members of an Infallible Church: Tell him;</p>
            <p>This is only to talk big, and to be Judge in his own Cauſe. For, 1. A man may be certain, and ſure that he is in the right, without being Infallible.</p>
            <p>2. There is greater uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; more Diviſions and diverſity of Opinions (and that in matters of Faith) in the Chruch of <hi>Rome,</hi> then there are in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35275:8"/>
If he ſtartles at the Charge, and thinks himſelf affronted; deſire him (for his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to return an Anſwer, to the Learned Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> upon that Subject. The</p>
            <p n="2">2. Direction (with which likewiſe he is pleaſed to find fault) was this;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When you read the HolyScrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and do find ſome place which is too difficult for you, do not then pretend to interpret it your ſelves. But beg the Direction of your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guide; and deſire him to ſhew you how it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems thisGentleman is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſhew his skill; other-wiſe this <hi>Expedient</hi> (for a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he knows) might have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35275:8"/>
paſs'd without his Cenſure.</p>
            <p>'Tis very ſurprizing; that a <hi>Romiſh Prieſt,</hi> who expects ſuch blind obedience to his Dictates, ſhould yet be thus offended at this honeſt Advice.</p>
            <p>Byt the Reaſon is evident. For whilſt the good <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are ſo kind to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> and ſo careful of <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> as to own their Clergy (as Bleſſed be God they do, notwithſtanding all the Arts of <hi>Rome</hi> to withdraw them from us) I ſay, whiſt they ſtick to their Clergy, through Gods Bleſſing, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſafe.</p>
            <p>As to the ſlavery of ſuch ſubmiſſion (which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſuggeſts) with reſpect
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35275:9"/>
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 'tis an invidious Reflection.</p>
            <p>We do indeed deſire you to take our Advice. <hi>Not for that we have Dominion over your Faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by Faith ye ſtand,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 24.</p>
            <p>Now the Scripture is the only Rule of our Faith; and as ſuch (to uſe his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) <hi>we will ſtand and fall by it.</hi> (Plain-man's Anſwer. p. 4.) <hi>And therefore</hi> (as he well reminds you) <hi>you muſt ſearch diligently and ſoberly into it your ſelves.</hi> (lb. p. 4.) Imitate thoſe noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> who <hi>received the word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo.</hi> Acts 17. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:35275:9"/>
But to what purpoſe (thinks this Author) do you read the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which neither you, nor your Clergy, can pretend to interpret?</p>
            <p>And why not? Cannot the Divines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> interpret Scripture as well as the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> No ſaith he, becauſe they are not infallible, (and thus he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids us at leaſt <hi>ten</hi> times in this very Anſwer.)</p>
            <p>But what ſtrange imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is this? That thoſe men ſhould be thus concern'd for the want of infallibility in others, who have ſo little of it themſelves.</p>
            <p>For is there any thing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35275:10"/>
more fallible and contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then thoſe vaſt Volums of Popiſh Commentators, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven make our ſhelves to crack? And yet all theſe, fallible as they are, owned and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the uſual <hi>Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>permiſſu Superiorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now had I leaſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate, I would deſire this Miſſioner (who writes to me in your name) to reſolve me. That ſince it would be very profitable for all Chriſtians, that the Scriptures ſhould be <hi>infallibly</hi> interpreted; why doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy particular Doctors to Interpret them <hi>fallibly?</hi> Why are ſuch different and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory Expoſitions publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35275:10"/>
by her Authority? Why doth ſhe not rather Petition his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> or whoever elſe is beſt able to do it, to explain them <hi>Infallibly?</hi> Why doth ſhe <hi>hide her Candle under a Buſhel,</hi> and <hi>keep her Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> of interpreting Scripture infallibly, <hi>wrapt up in a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin?</hi> How ſuch unfaithfulneſs can be anſwer'd to her Lord and Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I leave him ſadly to conſider. <hi>To him that knoweth to do good and doth it not, to him it is ſin.</hi> James 4. 17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I did direct you; <hi>As far as poſſible to avoid all Diſputes about Religion.</hi> And thus far he allows you to follow my Advice. <hi>For he hates conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35275:11"/>
heats and animoſities.</hi> And indeed ſo do I, as being fully convinced, that it is much more profitable, both for me and my Pariſh, to ſpend my time in Devotion and practical Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then in theſe unpleaſing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes.</p>
            <p>And I have great reaſon to affirm; That the reſt of my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> are likewiſe of the ſame mind.</p>
            <p>But ſince the importunity of others, in ſeducing our People, hath forced us to it, we dare not now be ſilent: and think our ſelves obliged as good Shepherds, not only to feed our Flocks; but alſo to keep them from wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring into by-paths, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from thoſe that would lead them aſtray.</p>
            <p>To his Exceptions againſt my <hi>Fourth</hi> Expedient I do thus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
            <p>That it will be time enough
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35275:11"/>
to enquire after the Priviledges of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, when you are firſt convinced; That it is your Duty to leave the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whoever would perſwade you to ſuch a Separation (I told you if he will proceed rationally and to the purpoſe) he muſt firſt convince you;</p>
            <q>
               <p> That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is no ſound Member of the Church Catholick: But that her Doctrine is either <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective</hi> or <hi>Falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he pretends that it is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective;</hi> he muſt then ſhew, that there are ſome Truths neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be believed, as Articles of Faith, which the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth not receive as ſuch. And alſo that there are ſome neceſſary Duties, or Parts of Worſhip, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> either wholly omits, or elſe doth not require under any ſuch neceſſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:35275:12"/>
But if he affirms, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Falſe,</hi> he muſt then prove; That the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth require ſome <hi>unlawful</hi> Condition of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and that either in <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worſhip.</hi> Plainly thus.</p>
               <p>He muſt make it appear That her Faith is <hi>Erroneous,</hi> and contrary to the written word of God; <hi>The Faith once deliver'd to the Saints.</hi> Or elſe that her Worſhip is <hi>unlawful,</hi> Superſtitious or Idolatrous.</p>
            </q>
            <p>All <hi>this indeed he thought very reaſonable. And becauſe he hath no leaſure for long enquiries,</hi> (p. 7.) I will not be ſo rude as to preſs him beyond his Meaſures.</p>
            <p>However I muſt be ſo oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to aſſure him; That when he hath found his Arguments, I ſhall be ready to attend him.</p>
            <p>And now (my <hi>good Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners)</hi> having diſpatcht this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35275:12"/>
let me thus briefly enforce my former</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Admonition.</head>
               <p>'TIS a ſerious thing to change your Religion. Eternity depends upon it. And therefore 'tis an unpardonable Error, to be guilty of raſhneſs in ſo weighty a concern.</p>
               <p>Be not perſwaded out of your Senſes with confidence and noiſe. Nor do you preſently conclude, that ſome men are in the <hi>Right;</hi> becauſe they ſay it is impoſſible they ſhould be in the <hi>Wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they think to frighten you into their way by telling you; that you are other-wiſe Damned: Regard ſuch threatnings no more then you would the Ravings of a Quaker. <hi>For not he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth himſelf is approved, but whom the Lord Commendeth. 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:35275:13"/>
Be not diſcouraged; nor ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the truth of your Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at firſt hearing you cannot Anſwer a Sophiſtical <hi>Objection.</hi> Thinking men, who expect ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Arguments, may poſſibly be ſurpriz'd, on the ſuddain, with ſuch ſlender Stuff. For even a Child may puzzle a States-man, at <hi>Riddle my Riddle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe kind of Tricks, when a little examined, how trifling do they appear? and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify nothing but the Confidence of thoſe who urge them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remember this, and ſhew your ſelves men.</hi>
